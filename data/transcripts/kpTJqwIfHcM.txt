[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.720]   where we discuss science
[00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.860]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:10.040]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.160]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.200]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.680]   My guest today is Asi Wind.
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.760]   Asi Wind is one of the top magicians
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.420]   and mentalists in the world.
[00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.000]   Now, you may be asking yourself,
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.840]   why would the Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.640]   host a magician mentalist?
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.040]   And the obvious answer perhaps would be
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.840]   that magicians and mentalists reveal to us
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.520]   where our gaps in perception reside.
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.760]   That is where the human brain falters
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.200]   such that magicians and mentalists
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.840]   can take advantage of that and give us the impression,
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.740]   the illusion that certain things happened when they didn't.
[00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.580]   However, during today's discussion,
[00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.920]   you will learn that Asi Wind's magic and mentalist work,
[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.520]   which by the way is absolutely astonishing.
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.160]   You can see examples of this
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.920]   in some of the links in the show note captions
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.520]   that will take you to YouTube clips
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.560]   in which Asi did some of these tricks
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.760]   and mentalist work on me directly in the studio.
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.160]   And there are other examples out there
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.620]   that we've linked to on the internet as well.
[00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.680]   That the work that Asi Wind does
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.960]   illustrates how we form memories,
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.400]   how we erase memories and the specific things
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.540]   that we all can do in order to stamp down certain memories
[00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.580]   and to erase other memories.
[00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.000]   Indeed, much of what Asi Wind's work does
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.640]   is to use an understanding of how the brain works
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.860]   in order to create false memories,
[00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.920]   to erase recent memories,
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.800]   and indeed to use emotion and empathy and storytelling
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.720]   in order for you, the observer,
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.560]   to create a perception of something that happened
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.120]   that may or may not have actually happened.
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.600]   Indeed, what Asi reveals to us today
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.000]   tells us not how a magician or mentalist fools us,
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   but rather how we, with our own brains,
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.560]   lead ourselves to believe that certain things happened
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.240]   when in fact they may or may not have happened.
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.400]   And the way that we collaborate with others
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.260]   in order to create those either false or real perceptions.
[00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.280]   It's a discussion that I'm sure everyone,
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.180]   whether or not you're a fan of magic or not,
[00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.420]   will find fascinating.
[00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.900]   Indeed, I learned so much from the discussion with Asi
[00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.340]   about neuroscience and about how the human brain
[00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.500]   constructs narratives of the past, present, and future,
[00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.660]   that it informs not just my understanding
[00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.900]   of how the brain works, but indeed how to learn better,
[00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.460]   how to remember things better,
[00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.260]   and to consolidate that information,
[00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.100]   to really stamp it into your memory
[00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.540]   so that you never forget.
[00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.180]   So while Asi Wind is a magician and mentalist,
[00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.660]   today's discussion is really a discussion
[00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.180]   about the neuroscience of how to learn, how to forget,
[00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.920]   how to access creativity, and how art and storytelling,
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.380]   empathy, and emotion all can allow us
[00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.060]   to access powers within us that make us far more effective
[00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.540]   in whatever pursuits we may be after.
[00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.260]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize
[00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.220]   that this podcast is separate from my teaching
[00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.940]   and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.100]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.900]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.620]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.860]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.660]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.660]   Our first sponsor is Element.
[00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.220]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.600]   with everything you need and nothing you don't.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.580]   That means plenty of salt, magnesium, and potassium,
[00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.580]   the electrolytes, but no sugar.
[00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.660]   As I mentioned before on this podcast,
[00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.260]   I'm a big believer in getting sufficient hydration
[00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.180]   and making sure that that hydration
[00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.140]   includes sufficient electrolytes,
[00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.100]   salt, magnesium, and potassium.
[00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.180]   And the reason for that is that all the cells in our body,
[00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.740]   but indeed, especially our neurons, our nerve cells,
[00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.320]   are critically reliant on electrolytes and hydration
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.860]   in order to function properly.
[00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.100]   Element makes it very easy to get the hydration
[00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.400]   and electrolytes you need.
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.380]   When I wake up in the morning,
[00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:43.540]   one of the first things I do
[00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.120]   is to drink 16 to 32 ounces of water
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.340]   with a packet of Element dissolved in it.
[00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.900]   I particularly like the raspberry-flavored Element,
[00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.140]   but then again, I also like the watermelon flavor
[00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.260]   and the citrus flavor and the orange flavor.
[00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.980]   So basically what I'm saying is
[00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.140]   I really like all the flavors of Element.
[00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.420]   If you'd like to try Element,
[00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.060]   you can go to drinkelement, spelled lmnt.com/huberman
[00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.100]   to claim a free sample pack with your order.
[00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.060]   Again, that's drinkelement, lmnt.com/huberman.
[00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.180]   Today's episode is also brought to us by BetterHelp.
[00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.980]   BetterHelp offers professional therapy
[00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.860]   with a licensed therapist carried out online.
[00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:21.580]   I've been going to therapy for well over 30 years.
[00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.060]   Initially, I didn't have a choice.
[00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.500]   It was a condition of being allowed to stay in school,
[00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.080]   but pretty soon I realized
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.900]   that therapy is extremely valuable.
[00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.220]   In fact, I consider doing regular therapy
[00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.980]   just as important as getting regular exercise,
[00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.300]   including cardiovascular exercise and resistance training,
[00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.360]   which of course I also do every week.
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.320]   The reason I know therapy is so valuable
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.060]   is that if you can find a therapist
[00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.660]   with whom you can develop a really good rapport,
[00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.980]   you not only get terrific support
[00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.900]   for some of the challenges in your life,
[00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.520]   but you also can derive tremendous insights
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.660]   from that therapy.
[00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.420]   Insights that can allow you to better
[00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.100]   not just your emotional life and your relationship life,
[00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.380]   but of course also the relationship to yourself
[00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:00.940]   and to your professional life,
[00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.700]   to all sorts of career goals.
[00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.940]   In fact, I see therapy as one of the key components
[00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.620]   for meshing together all aspects of one's life
[00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.540]   and being able to really direct one's focus and attention
[00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.260]   toward what really matters.
[00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:13.460]   If you'd like to try BetterHelp,
[00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.900]   go to betterhelp.com/huberman
[00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.580]   to get 10% off your first month.
[00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.560]   Again, that's betterhelp.com/huberman.
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.500]   Today's episode is also brought to us by AeroPress.
[00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.520]   AeroPress is similar to a French press for making coffee,
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.620]   but is in fact a much better way to make coffee.
[00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.300]   I first learned about AeroPress well over 10 years ago,
[00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.340]   and I've been using one ever since.
[00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.060]   AeroPress was developed by Alan Adler,
[00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.020]   who was an engineer at Stanford.
[00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.760]   And I knew of Alan because he had also built
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.660]   the so-called Aerobe Frisbee.
[00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.540]   So he was sort of famous in our community
[00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.440]   for developing these different feats of engineering
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.300]   that turned into commercial products.
[00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:52.380]   Now, I love coffee.
[00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.500]   I'm somebody that drinks coffee nearly every day,
[00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.840]   usually about 90 to 120 minutes
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.740]   after I wake up in the morning, although not always.
[00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.320]   Sometimes if I'm going to exercise,
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.660]   I'll drink coffee first thing in the morning.
[00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.220]   But I love, love, love coffee.
[00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:06.860]   And what I've personally found is that
[00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.180]   by using the AeroPress,
[00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.060]   I can make the best possible tasting cup of coffee.
[00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.900]   I don't know what exactly it is in the AeroPress
[00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.600]   that allows the same beans to be prepared
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.820]   into a cup of coffee that tastes that much better
[00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.580]   as compared to any other form of brewing that coffee,
[00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.660]   even the traditional French press.
[00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:26.900]   The AeroPress is extremely easy to use,
[00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.820]   and it's extremely compact.
[00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.860]   In fact, I take it with me whenever I travel,
[00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.220]   and I use it on the road in hotels, even on planes.
[00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:34.380]   I'll just ask for some hot water
[00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.980]   and I'll brew my coffee or tea right there on the plane.
[00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.740]   With over 55,000 five-star reviews,
[00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:43.220]   AeroPress is the best reviewed coffee press in the world.
[00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:44.780]   If you would like to try AeroPress,
[00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:48.180]   you can go to aeropress.com/huberman.

[00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:08.100]   And now for my discussion with Aussie Wind.
[00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:09.940]   Aussie Wind, welcome.
[00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:11.380]   - Thank you for having me.
[00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:14.900]   - I can't tell you how excited I am to have you here today.
[00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.740]   I've seen you do your live shows twice,
[00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.260]   once in Los Angeles, once in New York,
[00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.300]   and both times there were three major effects.
[00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:27.260]   First of all, I was absolutely astonished.
[00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:31.740]   There's truly no hyperbole that can capture
[00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:33.620]   what you are capable of doing.
[00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:37.260]   Just by way of example, folks,
[00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:41.460]   prior to coming in here, Aussie agreed to do a trick.
[00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:44.700]   He let me select a card,
[00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:47.380]   an ace of hearts from a deck of cards.
[00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:49.020]   I held it.
[00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:50.680]   There was another card, ace of diamonds.
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:51.520]   I also held that.
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.300]   I looked at them, I turned them over in my hands.
[00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.860]   He's not touching them.
[00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:57.860]   He asked somebody in the room for a number, number, number.
[00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:58.900]   Everyone provides a number.
[00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:00.620]   Then he asked me which person's number
[00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:02.260]   I would like to select.
[00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.440]   There's no prior agreements
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.280]   or communication here whatsoever.
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.680]   I selected the number seven.
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:11.880]   He says, "Turn over the cards that are still in my hands."
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:12.720]   He hasn't touched me.
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:16.280]   I turn over the cards and now they are sevens, not aces.
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:20.520]   Unbelievable, and yet it happened.
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:23.080]   And that's but a minor example
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.040]   of the sorts of things that you do.
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:27.920]   So that's the first thing, absolutely astonishing.
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:31.520]   Two, you involve many of the senses,
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.720]   not just visual perception, memory, et cetera,
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:35.120]   but many of the senses.
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:37.200]   And groups of people.
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:41.000]   You are able to somehow create perceptions in people
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.160]   or perhaps these perceptions are accurate,
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.240]   that certain things have happened
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:48.540]   and everyone agrees that these things happen.
[00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:51.480]   So it's not just one person being "tricked."
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.560]   And then the third is that you and I both share
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:57.480]   a fascination with the human mind and perception,
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:58.960]   which is really one of the main reasons
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.320]   why you're here today.
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:04.480]   Because you are a scientist who I believe
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:08.400]   understands how perception works,
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:11.680]   understands the gaps in perception and memory,
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:13.820]   and understands these things at a practical level
[00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:16.760]   that no neuroscientist, not I, nor anyone else,
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.000]   who could tell you about the nuts and bolts
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.360]   of the brain and nervous system could ever approach.
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.720]   So welcome.
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:25.040]   I'm super excited for our conversation.
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:30.040]   And my first question is when you do a trick
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.560]   with one person, with many people,
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.920]   how confident are you that you're going
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.040]   to get the answer correct?
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.120]   Meaning, are you always operating at the level
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:45.440]   of 100% certainty that you're going to get it right?
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.960]   Or rather, is there a little bit of a gap?
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.800]   Are you running a 90% probability?
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.640]   And the reason I start with this question
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:57.160]   is that I think it's a very different situation
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:00.280]   when the mentalist, the magician,
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:02.120]   is certain it's going to work out
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:03.840]   as opposed to when it's not.
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:05.560]   And I think it's the dynamic tension
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:08.560]   of the possibility that it might not work out
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:13.560]   that gets everyone so engrossed in what you do.
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:17.160]   - Yeah, so first of all, a lot of people think,
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:18.000]   do you ever fail?
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.200]   Do you ever get it wrong?
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.920]   And the truth is there's something they don't know.
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:23.720]   We're going to reveal some secrets here.
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:24.600]   A lot of people don't know
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:27.360]   that we are very much like jazz musicians.
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.200]   I'm not a musician.
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:31.160]   I'm going to probably butcher this analogy here.
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:34.960]   But we write the story as it goes.
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:38.560]   In other words, you might see me do a trick
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:41.800]   and think that's what I do every day, but I don't.
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.640]   So in other words, if something goes wrong,
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:47.240]   'cause every person is really unpredictable.
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:48.320]   I say, take any card.
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.920]   Maybe I'm trying to make you take a certain card.
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:52.640]   Maybe I'm trying to influence you,
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.240]   and you're not going for it.
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.280]   I'm okay with making a little detour.
[00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.440]   You just don't know I'm taking the detour.
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.960]   And I'm improvising, and then we'll go somewhere else.
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.760]   And I'm okay with that.
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.520]   So a lot of the magic that I love to do,
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.760]   we call it jazzy magic,
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:12.320]   is magic that literally gets written as we go,
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.040]   but I'm the only one who knows it.
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:17.760]   And you go, wow, it's concluded beautifully, right?
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:20.080]   So there's some times when I, like after a show,
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.480]   and I go, wow, this did not work, and that didn't work.
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:23.480]   And people will say, what do you mean?
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.080]   Everything worked perfect.
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.240]   They don't know.
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:29.200]   What I see is a little different than what you see.
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.560]   So in that sense, when you're an amateur magician,
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:32.600]   you're just starting out,
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.160]   and you don't have the experience,
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.840]   you can literally just get stuck and go,
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:39.600]   sorry, let's do it again.
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.320]   And it could happen.
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:43.840]   But for a seasoned performer,
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:46.480]   someone who does it again and again and again,
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:50.440]   I'll borrow from a Pendulit analogy that I love.
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:53.800]   It's like "Groundhog Day," the movie.
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:58.800]   We get to relive the same night again and again and again.
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.520]   And guess what?
[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:02.760]   People are very much alike.
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.240]   I'll hear the same heckling.
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.560]   I'll hear the same thing.
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:07.960]   Or I start to see types.
[00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.960]   This person is gonna be confrontational.
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:11.160]   This person is gonna be,
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:14.480]   is a person who believes maybe in supernatural.
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.440]   Everybody has a vibe.
[00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.120]   And even though I'm not a scientist,
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.480]   I'm not a psychologist,
[00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:21.280]   I don't have any degrees in any of those,
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:25.440]   but I'm a practitioner of psychology.
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:27.040]   I tried the same trick a million times,
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.800]   and I start to see patterns,
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:32.520]   behavioral patterns that I can use to my advantage.
[00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:34.240]   Like, for example, I noticed that it's easier
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.040]   to fool smart people
[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.240]   as opposed to people who are not so smart.
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:39.720]   - Tell me more about that.
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:43.560]   - 'Cause I'm relying on the bank of information
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:45.520]   you have in your head against you.
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:46.480]   It's Tai Chi.
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.240]   I know what you know.
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:50.000]   And I know that whenever you view anything,
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.760]   you have to fill in the blanks with lots of information.
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:53.960]   I show you a couple of things and say,
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:55.880]   "Okay, this makes sense, this, da-da-da."
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:58.440]   And I know how you think.
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.520]   And the fact that I have an idea
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:03.080]   of what you know and what you don't know,
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.800]   I can use it against you.
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.800]   And that's a beautiful concept, right?
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:08.080]   As opposed to someone who's not so educated.
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.440]   I don't know what he knows.
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.240]   And they tend to think very simple,
[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:14.000]   and they're the ones to figure out magic the most
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.320]   because they don't fill in the blanks.
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:17.880]   They take it for what it is.
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:20.720]   You telling yourself a better story.
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:25.120]   You enriching the experience based on all this,
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:27.920]   the wealth of information you have about psychology
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:30.040]   and how this works and how perception works
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:32.120]   and how memory works.
[00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:35.560]   For example, you just described a trick I did for you.
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:39.120]   You did not describe the trick.
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:43.560]   You described your memory of that trick.
[00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:46.840]   So my job, you know, and I'm borrowing from my master,
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:49.800]   maestro, Juan Tamariz, who's my favorite magician
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:51.480]   of all time, and I consider him,
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:53.320]   we'll talk about him quite a bit now.
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:57.680]   He taught me so much, but he talks a lot about memory.
[00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:01.360]   Like we are, first of all, we're encoding the information.
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.440]   I give you something to encode.
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:05.680]   Then I'm asking you to store it,
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:09.800]   either in short-term memory, medium-term, long-term.
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:12.640]   I don't know if it's even a real term,
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:14.840]   but a chemical memory, right?
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:17.760]   When it gets embedded in your memory.
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:20.640]   And then I'm trying to manipulate
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:25.080]   how you're going to recall the experience.
[00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:28.520]   And what you did, you described my trick
[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:30.560]   in a way that I could never do.
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:33.080]   I wish I could perform the trick you just described.
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.600]   I can't.
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:37.440]   But I was trying to create at least the impression
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.560]   you recorded a feeling you had.
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:41.880]   You did not record what you saw and experienced.
[00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:43.440]   You recorded a feeling.
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:46.560]   It felt so amazing that the feeling
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:50.040]   was coded in the memory as well.
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:54.000]   And therefore, you were the co-author of that trick.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.800]   You helped me fool you.
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:59.080]   - I'm very curious about the role of emotion
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:01.720]   in the co-authoring of these tricks.
[00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:03.480]   And by the way, folks,
[00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:04.680]   the conversation we're having today
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:07.680]   is not just about magic tricks and mentalists.
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:10.520]   This occurs at the level of interactions
[00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:13.320]   between people, one-to-one.
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.920]   This occurs at the level of media
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:18.560]   to the general audience of the world.
[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:22.040]   This stuff scales at every level
[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:23.840]   and in every domain of life.
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:27.040]   And we'll get to how exactly that occurs.
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:28.040]   I wonder if I could ask you
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:30.200]   about the reverse engineering of a trick,
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:31.560]   a hypothetical trick. - Sure, sure, sure.
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:33.720]   - So tell me if this trick is possible.
[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:36.120]   And if so, one of the possible ways
[00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:38.200]   that you would do this.
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:41.480]   I think I've seen you do something similar to this
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:43.600]   or other mentalists do something similar to this.
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:46.120]   You're standing in a room full of people,
[00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:48.200]   let's say 50 people,
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:51.160]   and you have a piece of paper and a pen,
[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:53.240]   and you say, "Okay, I'm going to write down
[00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:54.840]   a series of numbers."
[00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:56.960]   And you write them down, you fold it up,
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:58.080]   you put it on a table next to you,
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:59.160]   you set the pen down.
[00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:02.440]   There's no contact with it anymore.
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.080]   And then you go around the room
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:07.600]   and you just ask people for numbers between one and 25.
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:09.520]   You ask a certain number of people.
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:12.000]   And then somehow you return to the paper,
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.120]   you open it up, and that's the sequence of numbers.
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:18.400]   It seems like a straightforward but astonishing trick.
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:20.720]   - It's a classic. - A classic, okay.
[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:21.560]   - Classic of magic.
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:23.360]   - For people like me,
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:27.160]   we want to know at least one solution to that challenge.
[00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:30.520]   How does, what's one way in which a magician could do that?
[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:33.880]   Obviously, we start to go to the physical explanation.
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:35.720]   Okay, somebody underneath the table
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:37.600]   that the piece of paper was on
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:39.000]   wrote down the numbers they heard
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.280]   and put it on the table.
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:43.400]   Another solution would be that there was a stack of papers
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:45.120]   up there with any number of different combinations,
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:48.040]   but then it's a very large number, big stack of paper,
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:50.840]   then it becomes hard to hide and on and on.
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:53.360]   All going in the wrong direction, of course.
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:59.720]   I can also think of the end product way of doing this,
[00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:02.520]   where the piece of paper that you show
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:04.640]   has the numbers that the people stated,
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:07.960]   but somehow we think it's those numbers
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.080]   when it's actually other numbers.
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:10.920]   Like there's some sort of visual illusion
[00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:12.600]   that we all agree on seeing,
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:13.680]   but here I'm just guessing.
[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:16.240]   So how could one do that trick?
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:19.240]   - Wow, we need two hours to dissect this one.
[00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:20.120]   So here's the deal.
[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:21.120]   I just noticed something
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:24.160]   as you were going through all the options,
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.160]   as someone, I assume you're not a magician.
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:27.600]   - No.
[00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:30.200]   - I just realized that a quality of magic
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:35.200]   is that it ignites your imagination and your creativity.
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:39.840]   You just basically saw something that has no explanation
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:42.440]   and you're a knowledgeable guy.
[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:45.560]   You know a lot about a lot of things
[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:48.840]   and in a good way, it bothers you.
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:51.920]   Why don't I know that answer?
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:54.400]   I know so much about the mind and how we sleep
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:59.400]   and how certain exercises affect our bodies and blah, blah,
[00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:02.800]   but this series of number, I don't know.
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:05.040]   And that drives you nuts a bit,
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:06.480]   but it's good.
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.560]   'Cause then your mind starts racing
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:10.640]   and in thinking of everything you said
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:15.640]   is a wonderful exercise in problem solving, right?
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:17.080]   How could be achieved?
[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:21.080]   And then you slowly rule them out as too much paper,
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:23.720]   too much work, hiring somebody under a table
[00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:25.000]   to write maybe a solution,
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.360]   but you have to pay somebody just to do that job.
[00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:33.280]   But it's nice because we're teasing the mind.
[00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:35.320]   We're challenging the mind in an era
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:38.440]   where it seems like all the information is out there.
[00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:41.960]   My smartphone can do, you know,
[00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:44.120]   more than my first computer could, right?
[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:46.240]   In my pocket.
[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:49.520]   So we are up against, and by the way,
[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:52.440]   every time I tell you this, it's a bit of a tangent here.
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:55.800]   Every time technology advances,
[00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:58.040]   magicians get scared.
[00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:01.840]   Say, oh, people, they can do all these marvelous things.
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:03.920]   I mean, how are they gonna care about
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:07.600]   the number you just spoke, or a car changing in my hand?
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:10.920]   And I attribute that to, again,
[00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:14.640]   your desire to see something marvelous.
[00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:18.000]   Without, by the way, there are people
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.840]   that don't wanna see magic.
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:22.960]   Like I do something that really seems impossible
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:25.200]   and they go, eh, sleight of hand.
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:27.320]   They come up with a very simple solution.
[00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:30.360]   They're not nitpicking about exactly how you did it.
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:33.360]   They go, oh, he's fast, he's fast with his hands, or.
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:37.560]   You know, they come up with a very simple solution.
[00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:40.080]   I don't know why it satisfies them, but it does.
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:45.080]   And it's because they lack the desire to see magic.
[00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:50.120]   So to me, again, and we're going back to the co-authoring,
[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:53.760]   I really need someone, a partner, whenever I do magic,
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:55.720]   that someone who has this desire
[00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:59.320]   to see something that's beautiful,
[00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:02.280]   that's going to bend the rules
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:05.400]   of what we know is possible, right?
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:07.160]   And they're joining me.
[00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:09.320]   So to your question, how is it done?
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:14.320]   There's many, many ways to achieve this effect.
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:15.960]   And because we don't possess,
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:17.640]   I don't, we can talk about this if you want,
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:18.560]   about the supernatural.
[00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:21.320]   I don't believe that anybody possesses supernatural powers
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:22.960]   or even close to that.
[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:29.800]   And because of that, we have to cheat.
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:32.120]   We have to do some dirty work,
[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:34.080]   which I don't want you to know about.
[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:36.680]   And so in other words,
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:38.680]   every trick that they do has a little scar,
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:42.440]   a little, a moment I wish did not exist.
[00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:43.560]   And by the way, a magician,
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:45.680]   when they choose a trick like that,
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.960]   they need to say, oh, I can go this route or this route.
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:50.680]   They're going to pay a price.
[00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:53.120]   With this version, oh, I cannot do it this way.
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:54.760]   Here, it's not as clean.
[00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:56.240]   Here, I cannot be as direct.
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:59.440]   Here, I have to choose maybe certain people in the audience.
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:00.720]   Again, I'm tiptoeing around it
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:02.800]   so I don't reveal how it's done.
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:05.920]   But you're making a sacrifice with every choice you make.
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:10.920]   The goal is at the end to make somebody as smart as you go,
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:13.240]   how?
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:14.400]   And then start racing.
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:18.060]   And at the end, you reach a dead end, hopefully.
[00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:20.680]   It's magic.
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:22.760]   You excel.
[00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:25.040]   And I enjoy this.
[00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:27.880]   And that's, I want you to surrender.
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:29.240]   And it's a good surrender.
[00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:31.880]   It's not, you're not being defeated.
[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:36.880]   You give into this place where magic could happen.
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:39.680]   You make room for something
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:44.000]   that should not happen in this world to happen.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.800]   And that's why I love magic so much.
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:49.200]   It is a bit of a reminder that,
[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:50.320]   I'll tell you a story.
[00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:53.880]   There is a joggler who is not a magician.
[00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:56.720]   He's a, and I'm not gonna mention names for a reason.
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:58.120]   So he joggles on the streets
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:00.000]   and makes some money on the streets.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.720]   And one day, he goes to see a magic show.
[00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:08.360]   And the magic, the magician, a wonderful magician
[00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:10.600]   who does this wonderful act.
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:12.880]   It's the zip code act.
[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:16.640]   He says to people, "Tell me your zip code."
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:18.440]   And then he tells them where they live.
[00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:19.280]   "Tell me where you live."
[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:20.100]   He tells them the zip code.
[00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:22.440]   And then he describes places around them.
[00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:24.200]   "Oh, you have a Starbucks there in the bubble."
[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:25.600]   And like he described, it's amazing.
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:26.960]   It's wonderful.
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:30.320]   Now, this joggler, not a magician,
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:33.660]   watches a magician who is doing a trick.
[00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:37.040]   There's a scientific explanation to how it's done.
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:38.880]   It's not anything beyond that.
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:41.160]   And again, it's wonderful.
[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:44.600]   And he goes, "How did he do that?"
[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:47.680]   And then he comes up with the solution
[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:50.900]   that the magician must have memorized
[00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:52.460]   all the zip codes in the world.
[00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:57.900]   Not the case, but that's the impression.
[00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:01.900]   He goes home and starts memorizing
[00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:05.200]   all the zip codes in America first.
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:11.620]   He spends thousands of hours to memorize zip codes for real.
[00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:15.620]   He's doing the real version of what the magician did.
[00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:17.440]   And he performs it now.
[00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:21.000]   All over the country, he's doing the zip code act for real.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   And the beauty of this story is that a false performance,
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.840]   artificial representation of a skill,
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:33.520]   inspired somebody to do something that is real
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.900]   and therefore push his limits,
[00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:39.900]   his human, you know, realistic limits,
[00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:41.760]   to a level that a lot of people go,
[00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:44.000]   "That's not possible."
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.040]   Right?
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:47.960]   And I think it's a beauty about this.
[00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:50.480]   And again, it goes back to your question, how is it done?
[00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:53.240]   So maybe the solution you just came up with
[00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:55.240]   is better than what I do,
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:58.720]   but I just ignited you to think about it.
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:02.600]   So it's really a big reason,
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:04.940]   an important reason why I love magic so much.
[00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:10.400]   - Staying with my question of how a trick like that is done.
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:11.520]   - You really want to know.
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:13.480]   - Well, I don't think you're actually going to tell me
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:16.720]   the specific order of operations to make it happen.
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:17.960]   I don't expect that,
[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:22.960]   but I can think of two kind of end points
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:25.960]   for exploring this.
[00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:28.320]   One is, or at least two,
[00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:33.320]   one is to manipulate what's on the paper, right?
[00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:37.760]   Like the other is to manipulate what people say
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:39.060]   or are likely to say,
[00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:40.600]   perhaps by selecting people
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:42.100]   that are likely to say certain numbers,
[00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:43.660]   because you have some understanding of that.
[00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:45.160]   I don't know how that would happen.
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:49.080]   The other is to completely revise people's understanding
[00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:53.160]   of what just happened in a group.
[00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:55.360]   And I think the last possibility
[00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:57.800]   is the one that intrigues me and most people the most,
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:02.200]   the idea that even in the company of other rational,
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:06.680]   well-rested, sober, meaning non-inebriated
[00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:09.000]   or on drugs people.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:09.960]   - Sometimes it helps.
[00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:14.600]   - That there could be a collective perception
[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:16.220]   that is not accurate,
[00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:20.560]   but everyone agrees to confabulate together.
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:22.040]   And the reason I ask this,
[00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:23.720]   and I focus on this third possibility
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:25.280]   is that we know that the memory system
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:27.200]   is a confabulation system.
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:28.560]   A good example of this would be people
[00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:31.000]   who sadly have some form of dementia.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.800]   They often will find themselves in a room doing something.
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:37.240]   And if you ask them, "Hey, what were you doing?"
[00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:38.320]   They don't say, "I don't know."
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:40.360]   They say, "Oh, you know, I came in here to do something."
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:42.360]   And they create these elaborate stories
[00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:43.560]   of what got them there,
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:47.800]   which may make sense to them, might not.
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:48.640]   But we all do this.
[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:49.720]   We all confabulate.
[00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:51.980]   False memory is a huge topic unto itself,
[00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:54.960]   but we all confabulate.
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:56.360]   Memory is not perfect.
[00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:59.280]   So I imagine this third possibility
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:02.800]   is one that you work with and that you massage.
[00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:07.100]   How does one think about memory
[00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:09.340]   in the context of these experiments
[00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:11.460]   that, I just call them experiments,
[00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:12.300]   these tricks that you do?
[00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:14.100]   - I like, by the way, I love that word.
[00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:15.580]   - And here, we agreed that we were gonna talk
[00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:18.480]   about science today, as we always do whenever I see you.
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:23.660]   And in experiments, as people may or may not know,
[00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:26.580]   you ask a question, but you pose hypotheses.
[00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:28.700]   So you say like, "How do we cure cancer?"
[00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:30.820]   But then you pose a hypothesis.
[00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:33.180]   You say, "I think it's going to be cured
[00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:34.320]   "by doing blank, blank, and blank."
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:35.160]   And then you test that,
[00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:37.380]   and you try and rule out your hypothesis.
[00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:40.420]   So it's a little bit of why I call it an experiment.
[00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:45.420]   So for instance, is there a way that you can get people
[00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:48.900]   to believe that they saw the numbers,
[00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:51.780]   let's make it very simple, three, eight, and seven,
[00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:53.640]   when in fact you held up a piece of paper
[00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:56.340]   that said something very different?
[00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:57.940]   Have you done that before?
[00:26:57.940 --> 00:26:59.980]   - I see where you're going with this.
[00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:03.320]   And I love that you used the word experiments.
[00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:07.700]   One of my heroes, Chan Canasta, was a psychologist
[00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:11.900]   who used psychology in his work as a magician,
[00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:15.980]   as a mentalist, and he never called his pieces
[00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:17.500]   tricks or magic.
[00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:19.700]   He called them experiments.
[00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:21.460]   And he was careful about it.
[00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:24.460]   It's not just an aesthetic choice.
[00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:29.460]   He wanted to plant this seed in their mind.
[00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:32.040]   Experiment means it could fail.
[00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:35.140]   Okay, which is a very good starting point
[00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:39.260]   for any dramatic, because if something's gonna work,
[00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:43.300]   but if there's something at stake, something could fail,
[00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:44.580]   people are more engaged.
[00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:45.620]   So I love the word.
[00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:48.800]   I sometimes use the word, let's run an experiment.
[00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:51.140]   - Yeah, it's like these crazy people
[00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:53.980]   that climb up the side of buildings with no ropes.
[00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:55.620]   I mean, we don't want to see them fall,
[00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:58.460]   but the possibility that they could fall is what's exciting.
[00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:00.500]   The movie "Free Solo" with Alex Honnold.
[00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:03.080]   We all know at the beginning, he lives.
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:06.200]   He lives, and yet you want to see it
[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:08.000]   in case he might not live.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.440]   And even though you know he lives,
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.720]   in some ways that's a magic trick into itself.
[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:13.640]   - That's the brilliance of David Blaine,
[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:15.720]   who I consider one of my dearest friend
[00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:18.600]   and one of my favorite magicians in the world.
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:22.800]   And what he does, I mean, we can talk about him at length,
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:27.800]   but blending real stuff with magic,
[00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:32.020]   and sometimes it's hard to tell what is real and what's not.
[00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:35.020]   And I even love that aspect.
[00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:37.780]   And a lot of people don't know,
[00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:40.620]   but all the stuff he does is real.
[00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:42.060]   When he's holding his breath,
[00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:47.060]   night after night now in Vegas at the Wynn, 10 minutes.
[00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:52.420]   And sitting in the audience watching David do that
[00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:57.460]   is so inspiring because I look at it symbolically.
[00:28:57.460 --> 00:29:00.360]   He's showing us, 'cause he was inspired by a kid
[00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:05.280]   who survived being trapped under ice for a long time
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:08.240]   and recovered to full recovery.
[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:12.800]   And he goes, if he can do it, then everybody could.
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:17.280]   And it's a beautiful, to me, the message is so strong.
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:19.040]   Just beautiful.
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:20.400]   - I'd like to take a brief moment
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:23.360]   and thank one of our sponsors, and that's AG1.
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:26.000]   AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.300]   that also contains adaptogens.
[00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:31.420]   I started taking AG1 way back in 2012.
[00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:32.700]   The reason I started taking it
[00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:34.460]   and the reason I still take it every day
[00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:36.860]   is that it ensures that I meet all of my quotas
[00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:38.620]   for vitamins and minerals.
[00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:41.480]   And it ensures that I get enough prebiotic and probiotic
[00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:43.000]   to support gut health.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.460]   Now, gut health is something that over the last 10 years,
[00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:49.100]   we realized is not just important for the health of our gut,
[00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:51.260]   but also for our immune system
[00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:53.420]   and for the production of neurotransmitters
[00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:55.980]   and neuromodulators, things like dopamine and serotonin,
[00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:57.940]   in other words, gut health is critical
[00:29:57.940 --> 00:29:59.820]   for proper brain functioning.
[00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:02.500]   Now, of course, I strive to consume healthy whole foods
[00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:05.940]   for the majority of my nutritional intake every single day,
[00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:07.860]   but there are a number of things in AG1,
[00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:09.580]   including specific micronutrients
[00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:11.140]   that are hard to get from whole foods
[00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:13.020]   or at least in sufficient quantities.
[00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:15.440]   So AG1 allows me to get the vitamins and minerals
[00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:18.220]   that I need, probiotics, prebiotics, the adaptogens
[00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:20.220]   and critical micronutrients.
[00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:21.780]   So anytime somebody asks me
[00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:23.940]   if they were to take just one supplement,
[00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:25.520]   what that supplement should be,
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:28.180]   I tell them AG1, because AG1 supports
[00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:30.300]   so many different systems within the body
[00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:31.540]   that are involved in mental health,
[00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:33.180]   physical health and performance.
[00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:37.060]   To try AG1, go to drinkag1.com/huberman,
[00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:40.200]   and you'll get a year supply of vitamin D3K2
[00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:42.300]   and five free travel packs of AG1.
[00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:46.500]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman.
[00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:47.340]   - Orient me again, the question was-
[00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:49.700]   - Yeah, so the question is, have you done
[00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:51.840]   or is it possible to get people to think
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:53.500]   that you're holding up a piece of paper
[00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:55.080]   that says, no, I forget the numbers,
[00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:57.400]   my working memory wasn't engaged enough to do it,
[00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:59.680]   whatever, three, four, eight,
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:00.880]   that's not what I said earlier,
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:02.880]   when in fact they are looking at a piece of paper
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:04.260]   that says something different?
[00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:06.360]   Is that something that can be done?
[00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:08.400]   - Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:11.040]   There's actually a piece where you have a piece of paper,
[00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:12.800]   literally printed piece of paper,
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:14.760]   and you control someone's mind.
[00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:19.760]   You say, I'm gonna make you see things distorted.
[00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:22.240]   You're not gonna see reality the way everybody
[00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:25.920]   in this room including me will see it, starting now.
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:29.600]   And it's literally a piece of paper that says two plus two,
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:31.480]   and everybody can see it,
[00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:33.760]   the entire audience can see it's two plus two,
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:35.000]   what's the answer?
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.320]   And he goes, 16.
[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:42.460]   Okay, and let's try something easier, one plus one?
[00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:44.400]   He goes, 24.
[00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:50.320]   And this guy is cognitively smart, sharp,
[00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:54.960]   he's not on drugs, he cannot answer those questions.
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:58.240]   It's an augmentation of reality.
[00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:01.920]   And that manifests in many forms in magic,
[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:06.080]   the idea of seeing something that is in a sort,
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:10.560]   in the optical illusion land of what you see
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:12.160]   is not what you see.
[00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:14.360]   And that's probably applicable to every trick
[00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:16.800]   you'll ever see, what you see, it's not what you see.
[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:18.200]   It's what I want you to see.
[00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:21.560]   And I love that, and again,
[00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:25.680]   that John Canasta, the guy I spoke to you about,
[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:28.320]   he would go, he would take three cards,
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:31.280]   let's say Ace of Hearts, King of Clubs,
[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:33.760]   Seven of Spades, three cards.
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:38.480]   He'll go to a coffee shop and say, "Choose one."
[00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:41.800]   And they say, "King of Clubs, thank you."
[00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:44.120]   Go to another table, and he will do it all night.
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:45.720]   And people, what is he doing?
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:47.600]   He's not doing any magic, nothing.
[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:49.680]   He's just surveying the audience
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:52.960]   to see how they think, right?
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:57.320]   And this is information that we collect over the years.
[00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:00.200]   Like there's something called,
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:03.800]   I can influence you, let's say, to take a specific card,
[00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:05.720]   but it has to be done in such a way
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:08.920]   that it feels like it was a free choice.
[00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:10.760]   It was not a free choice.
[00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:13.520]   And the difference between a good or a great magician
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:16.640]   and a decent magician or an okay magician
[00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:19.680]   is that one makes you feel like, I chose this card.
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:23.000]   There is no way you made me pick this card.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:23.960]   There is no way.
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:27.200]   And that's a sort of augmentation.
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:32.080]   It's, you feel like you have control, and yet you don't.
[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:34.120]   And you feel it with conviction.
[00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:37.720]   You could swear, that's the one.
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:41.960]   So there's a famous, famous thing that he used to do.
[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:45.440]   He would say, "I can make people change their mind or not."
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:48.000]   And he says it up front.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.640]   He says, "You're gonna choose a card, okay?
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:52.080]   "Any card you like.
[00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:53.480]   "I'll go to the audience.
[00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:55.480]   "You point to any person you want.
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:56.800]   "They'll choose another card.
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:00.200]   "Whatever they choose will be the card you're thinking of.
[00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:02.440]   "And then I'll give them 10 seconds to change their mind.
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:06.240]   "And if they do, it will still be correct.
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:09.120]   "They can change their mind as many times as they want,
[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:10.480]   "and I don't care.
[00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:12.160]   "Once they say, 'That's it, that's the card,'
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:14.480]   "that will be the card you're thinking of."
[00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:16.920]   - How can that be?
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:18.200]   - So the truth is,
[00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:21.080]   and I'll reveal a little bit about that.
[00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:23.240]   There is no trickery here as far as, you know,
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:26.280]   sleight of hand or anything like that.
[00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:30.480]   He literally was a master at making people
[00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:35.240]   either want to stick to a decision or change it.
[00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:40.040]   He would basically manipulate their insecurity, their ego,
[00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:45.160]   something about them to either resist changing
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:47.440]   or to really want to change.
[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:53.920]   And to me, and I have a conflict, a dilemma about this,
[00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:56.640]   because my whole Foolish Act,
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:58.920]   which if you want, we can talk about,
[00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:04.840]   is really based on this conflict or this problem I have.
[00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:09.080]   Sometimes the method is way more beautiful
[00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:10.360]   than the effect itself.
[00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:13.200]   So that's why I have no problem telling you
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:14.640]   that Chen did that.
[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:19.640]   Chen found a way with using specific language
[00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:24.040]   or gestures or whatnot, without revealing too much,
[00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:27.000]   to make somebody either stick to their choice
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.160]   or change their mind.
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:30.440]   - He could literally control their bias
[00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:31.400]   toward one or the other.
[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:32.360]   - Yes.
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:33.960]   - Does it involve touching their body
[00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:35.440]   in any particular way?
[00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:36.840]   - Maybe. - Maybe.
[00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:40.200]   - Yeah, many times in your performances
[00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:43.400]   and the performances of other mentalists and magicians,
[00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:46.040]   they will say, pick a number, pick a card,
[00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:49.240]   and then right before the trick is about to advance,
[00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:50.960]   they'll say, "Are you sure?"
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:51.800]   Okay.
[00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:52.840]   - Oh, that's a big one.
[00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:54.280]   - And they'll say, "Yes, I'm sure,"
[00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:56.000]   or, "No, I'm going to switch."
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.280]   Okay.
[00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:00.040]   And based on what you've told us already,
[00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:03.480]   it's clear that the skilled mentalist or magician
[00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:05.520]   can work with either scenario.
[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:08.400]   Maybe it's a bit of a, it's the improvisation.
[00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:10.080]   But what I want to know is,
[00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:12.880]   when you look at somebody's physical body,
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:16.760]   how they sit, their shape, and other features,
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:19.400]   maybe how they dress, how they stand,
[00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:22.120]   maybe something about their eyes or their face,
[00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:24.520]   can you make better predictions
[00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:26.600]   as to what sorts of numbers they'll pick,
[00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:28.160]   whether or not they're going to stick to their choice
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:29.160]   or change their choice? - Absolutely.
[00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:30.000]   - Okay.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.040]   I think there's a lot of interest in this,
[00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:34.240]   and maybe you could, since we're talking in generic terms,
[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:35.760]   and we're not presenting you with a line of people
[00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:38.960]   and asking you which person would do what,
[00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:43.200]   would you be willing to share what some of those cues are?
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:46.800]   So I'm, you know, me, I wear this black shirt,
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:49.560]   and I have other shirts, but I don't wear them on camera.
[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:52.920]   And, you know, I comb my hair a certain way,
[00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:54.240]   I sit a certain way.
[00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:57.600]   I mean, what sorts of predictions emerge from that,
[00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:00.120]   or am I striking on the wrong variables?
[00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:03.760]   - So it's not the big things that will reveal to me what,
[00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:06.400]   'cause I do kind of like profile a little bit
[00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:08.440]   for the magic purposes,
[00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:10.120]   what kind of trick I will do with you
[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:11.400]   and what I can't do with you,
[00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:13.760]   what I will do with this guy or that guy, right?
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:16.880]   And it's not the shirt.
[00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:19.360]   It's not how you wear your hair.
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:21.240]   It's really small things.
[00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:25.200]   And I can talk about many people that influence me.
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:28.560]   Avner The Eccentric is one of my favorite performers.
[00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:32.080]   - His name is literally The Eccentric?
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:35.160]   - It's a different name, but he goes by Avner The Eccentric.
[00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:37.840]   And he's a wonderful performer.
[00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:40.640]   It's even hard to categorize what he does, but he's,
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:44.680]   I'm doing this service, a clown, a mime,
[00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:46.680]   a joggler, a magician.
[00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:50.920]   And I've never seen someone who's better
[00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:53.880]   at what we call audience management.
[00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:56.400]   Something we call audience management
[00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:58.400]   is how do you interact with people?
[00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:00.960]   And he's able to get,
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:07.120]   again, I'm butchering his class to something very simple,
[00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:11.200]   but he gets three yeses from a person,
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:16.520]   meaning I can ask you, non-verbally,
[00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:20.200]   to agree to participate with something I want you to do.
[00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:23.360]   And he will do small things,
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:24.880]   like just a little gesture,
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:27.840]   and he can see if they go for it.
[00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:30.280]   He sees if there's that dance.
[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:36.120]   Is that person complying to something very small,
[00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:38.080]   or is he resisting?
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:40.560]   And then easily I can go to the next person.
[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:45.120]   So, and he's a master, a master at doing that.
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:47.640]   Even breathing.
[00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:49.720]   If I breathe a certain way when I,
[00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:52.200]   this is, it blew my mind when I first learned from Avner.
[00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:55.280]   It's like when you walk into a place,
[00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:58.120]   so you don't see me, I'm behind a curtain or something,
[00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:02.320]   and I walk in, and the first thing I do is (exhales)
[00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:05.440]   or as opposed to (inhales)
[00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:07.120]   do I take the breath in or out
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:10.280]   when I, the first step I take on stage?
[00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:14.240]   And the audience, in a weird way, mimics that.
[00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:15.080]   - Really?
[00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:19.320]   - Yeah, so if I go (inhales and exhales)
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:22.640]   you feel, you kind of tend to relax with me.
[00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:27.640]   Now, if you want a more exaggerated example of that,
[00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:30.120]   if you watch a movie and it's really tense
[00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:34.160]   and there's tension, you will start feeling tension, right?
[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:38.040]   We're kind of like, empathy is a big, big part of what we do.
[00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:42.520]   That's why one of the things I choose to do in my show
[00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:44.000]   when I first start is not to start
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.240]   with the most amazing magic to blow your mind,
[00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:47.600]   oh my God, he's amazing.
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:51.600]   It's more, I gear the first pieces towards
[00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:54.120]   connecting with you.
[00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:56.240]   I'd rather say something really endearing, funny,
[00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:58.840]   connecting, truthful, honest,
[00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:01.960]   before I start trying to blow your mind.
[00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:02.800]   Why?
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:04.360]   I want to connect with you first,
[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:08.840]   so we, you know, a mother will be proud
[00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:11.360]   of her son's playing guitar and much more forgiving
[00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:12.880]   if he makes a little mistake or something,
[00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:15.000]   but every little achievement he will make,
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.040]   she will be so proud of him 'cause she has empathy.
[00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:20.200]   She wants him to succeed.
[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:22.320]   She wants him to do well.
[00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:24.200]   So I want you to adopt me.
[00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:26.360]   I want you to feel empathy towards me.
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:29.080]   I want you to be, I'm rooting for you.
[00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:31.120]   - This makes a lot of sense.
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:34.040]   I do some live events and I don't think about
[00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:36.760]   whether or not I exhale or inhale when I get out there,
[00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:38.280]   but I definitely try and get out there
[00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:41.640]   and just kind of take it all in and relax.
[00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:44.600]   And we have what I hope is a relaxing,
[00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:46.760]   interesting conversation and you kind of work
[00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:48.200]   with the amplitude of excitement.
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:50.440]   And I'm not thinking about it in any kind of conscious way,
[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:52.280]   but this is actually a wonderful tool
[00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:54.440]   that I hope everyone will export from this conversation,
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:57.400]   which is if you ever need to do public speaking.
[00:40:57.400 --> 00:40:58.240]   - Breathe.
[00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:00.280]   - Have probably a good long exhale
[00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:02.000]   as you get out there will be great.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   Everyone will relax.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   It's also tough for me to see live theater
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.800]   because oftentimes if it's not going well for them,
[00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:11.800]   I feel embarrassed for them.
[00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:13.160]   I think people vary, however,
[00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:15.760]   in terms of their levels of empathic attunement.
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:18.200]   Some people are very tuned into the emotional states
[00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:20.440]   of others and some are not.
[00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:23.280]   So are there people in audiences,
[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:26.200]   assuming a relatively random array of people
[00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:29.600]   that are fairly rigid, like you wouldn't want to,
[00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:31.760]   you wouldn't call them up to the table.
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:32.600]   - Absolutely.
[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:33.520]   - Okay.
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:36.880]   So when you select someone to come up in front of the crowd,
[00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:41.440]   are you basing that on some level of empathic attunement
[00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:44.160]   that they're in sync with you?
[00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:45.000]   - Absolutely.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:46.920]   So it starts with the first thing.
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:48.640]   Look, you come in cold.
[00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:50.200]   The audience, as you said,
[00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:52.320]   the first, and I'm quoting Avner here,
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:53.440]   the first thing they do is they say,
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:55.560]   "I hope this doesn't suck."
[00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:57.560]   And also the performer says,
[00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:00.240]   "I hope it's not gonna suck."
[00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:02.680]   The starting point is, it depends.
[00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:04.160]   Expectation could vary, you know,
[00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:05.600]   if something's really hyped and go,
[00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:06.560]   "Oh, this is gonna be great."
[00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:08.760]   Or you've seen the artists and you trust them.
[00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:11.800]   But if you come in cold, you don't know the person.
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:13.960]   You don't know if it's gonna be great or not.
[00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:15.960]   You just happen to be there and there's a magic show.
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:17.520]   All right, let's check it out.
[00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:19.640]   There's tension.
[00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:22.760]   There's almost like they're auditioning you.
[00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:26.360]   I wonder if it's gonna be worth my time.
[00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:28.840]   So, and I don't care if people bought a ticket
[00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:31.240]   to see my off-Broadway show or not,
[00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:34.120]   the first 10, 15 minutes,
[00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:38.240]   it's really about telling them in so many,
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:40.680]   you know, not words, but telling them,
[00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:42.040]   "I'm here for you.
[00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:44.120]   I'm here to connect with you.
[00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:46.400]   And I'm here to create this,
[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:50.000]   some wonderful thing that we're gonna feel together."
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.480]   I want them to feel that.
[00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:52.560]   - It's like an intimacy.
[00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:53.400]   - Yes.
[00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:54.360]   And that to me, by the way,
[00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:57.000]   is way more important than me fooling people.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.520]   Like if somebody came to me after the show and said,
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:01.800]   "Oh, wow, your magic is unbelievable.
[00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:03.200]   I have no idea how you did it."
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:05.200]   That's the lowest compliment I can get.
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:09.440]   And thankfully and gratefully,
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:12.880]   often I get the most common one is,
[00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:14.680]   "You know, the magic was great, but,
[00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:18.360]   you, we liked you."
[00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:19.560]   - They feel connected to you.
[00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:21.960]   - And I love that because to me,
[00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:23.680]   the magic is important.
[00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:25.560]   I want it to be really deceptive.
[00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:27.160]   I want it to be, you know,
[00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:29.280]   impossible and beautiful and whatnot.
[00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:33.200]   But to me, it's also a vehicle to connect with people.
[00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:34.520]   'Cause at the end of the day, that's what it is.
[00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:36.920]   And that's the only difference I can have.
[00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:38.040]   'Cause there's a lot of magicians.
[00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:41.400]   A lot of people can do magic that you can't figure out.
[00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:43.240]   That's the lowest bar.
[00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:45.200]   You fool me, good magician.
[00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:49.400]   Make me feel magic higher,
[00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:52.240]   and maybe feel magic and connect.
[00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:54.720]   It's like, if somebody cannot even explain
[00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:57.840]   what I did in my show and goes, "You had to be there."
[00:43:57.840 --> 00:43:59.400]   That's something Steve Martin says all the time.
[00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:01.080]   "You had to be there."
[00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:04.640]   I can't tell you with words what it's like to see his show.
[00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:06.920]   You have to see it in person.
[00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:10.000]   That, to me, is a very high goal.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:15.320]   I want him to remember the experience and the feeling
[00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:18.280]   rather than particularly, "Oh, did not..."
[00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:23.280]   I want him to care about what they experienced emotionally.
[00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:27.840]   - And that's how I recalled the trick that you did outside.
[00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:30.280]   The person who initially connected us,
[00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:32.760]   just absolutely terrific.
[00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:35.240]   What I call close contact card magician,
[00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:38.720]   Franco Pasquale, here in Los Angeles.
[00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:41.040]   He has amazing card skills.
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:41.880]   - Amazing.
[00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:43.840]   - He does something with his card tricks.
[00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:46.240]   I noticed, I'll go to the Magic Castle
[00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:47.080]   as often as possible,
[00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:48.640]   and I just watch and like to take this in,
[00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:50.400]   and I try and think about the neuroscience behind it,
[00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:51.800]   as you can tell.
[00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:54.840]   And when he lands a trick,
[00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:57.640]   meaning when the person takes the card and says,
[00:44:57.640 --> 00:44:59.600]   "Oh my goodness, how did you know?"
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:02.520]   Or it's like the ace switches the card, whatever it is.
[00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:04.880]   Franco also acts surprised.
[00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:08.240]   He joins you as an audience member momentarily.
[00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:09.480]   He goes, "Oh."
[00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:13.320]   And then he goes back to being the magician.
[00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:15.400]   And I find that especially important
[00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:18.640]   for people to understand because you do the same.
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:21.360]   And I always say, having studied the lectures
[00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:25.440]   of many, many spectacular scientists and lecturers,
[00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:28.240]   that the best lecturers in the classroom
[00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:30.080]   obviously are teaching the material
[00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:32.600]   from a place of deep understanding of the material,
[00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:34.560]   one would hope, right?
[00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:36.080]   So they have mastery of the material,
[00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:38.600]   in some case, virtuosity with the material.
[00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:40.440]   But as they're presenting the material
[00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:42.240]   to people who know nothing about it,
[00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:46.640]   they themselves are showing their delight in the material
[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:48.680]   as if it's the first time they've ever seen it.
[00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:51.440]   And so they are both student and teacher at the same time,
[00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:53.320]   and you feel immense resonance with them.
[00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:54.160]   - That's nice.
[00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:55.680]   - And it reminds me of the experience
[00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:58.840]   of seeing you do magic or mentalist work.
[00:45:58.840 --> 00:45:59.840]   - Sure.
[00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:01.760]   - I'm yet to see you go, "Oh my goodness."
[00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:05.360]   But I think it's the sense
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:07.520]   that you're collaborating in something
[00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:10.480]   and there's this giving over of self.
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:14.280]   Like, "I trust Ossie to take me someplace with this."
[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:17.360]   So the resistant people, the people that sort of like,
[00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:20.080]   "I'm not gonna let him fool me," right?
[00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:21.720]   What's so amazing is that in your shows,
[00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:23.960]   oftentimes those people are the ones
[00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:26.440]   that are the ones walking out, just shaking their heads.
[00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:27.840]   I know because I've brought some of them along
[00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:31.200]   to your shows going, "There's no way.
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:32.480]   "There's no way."
[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:34.240]   And yet you got them.
[00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:36.440]   So do the resistant people serve a role
[00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:37.560]   even if they're not called up?
[00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:38.400]   - Of course.
[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:40.240]   - Yeah, what role do skeptics play
[00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:42.480]   in convincing other people that something happened
[00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:43.800]   that didn't really happen?
[00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:46.960]   - So first of all, the transformation.
[00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:49.240]   Somebody is a believer and you show them magic,
[00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:50.880]   and nice, it's wonderful.
[00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:52.760]   We can celebrate magic together.
[00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:56.120]   But if somebody is a skeptic, really skeptical,
[00:46:56.120 --> 00:47:01.120]   and I've had really, and I sensed that I could convert them.
[00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:03.080]   I could transform them.
[00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:05.720]   And the audience watches this transformation.
[00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:07.280]   So we're going from here to here.
[00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:09.520]   That's a wonderful thing.
[00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:11.960]   So every now and then I will recognize the person
[00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:13.360]   who's like, "Mm-mm-mm-mm."
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:17.120]   And you slowly start to see him melt and softens.
[00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:19.240]   - It's almost like a musician at a wedding.
[00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:20.080]   You know, they're the people
[00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:21.560]   that jump up and dance immediately.
[00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:23.240]   But if you're a skilled musician,
[00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:24.600]   you get that person that, you know,
[00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:26.600]   their wife is saying, "Come on, let's dance."
[00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:28.160]   And they're like, "Mm-mm, won't move."
[00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:30.760]   And then maybe you hit a certain motif in the music
[00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:32.320]   and the person taps their foot a little bit,
[00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:33.400]   moves their head.
[00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:35.600]   And then there's certain people that they won't dance at all
[00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:36.920]   unless their song comes up,
[00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:38.640]   and then they like dart to the dance floor.
[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:39.880]   Sounds a little bit like that.
[00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:40.760]   And you've captured them.
[00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:41.840]   You've captured their emotion.
[00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:43.020]   You've captured their willingness.
[00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:46.600]   You've captured their whole body willingness
[00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:48.160]   to participate in something
[00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:50.680]   that a minute before they were either too embarrassed,
[00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:53.760]   too stubborn, or too tired to engage in.
[00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:54.920]   - So here's the deal.
[00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:59.680]   Magic could be, and often is, intimidating.
[00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:02.760]   I'm basically challenging your intellect.
[00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:06.120]   And some people, if they take it the wrong way,
[00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:08.240]   what they hear is,
[00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:10.960]   "You're telling me that you're smarter than me.
[00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:13.160]   "You're telling me you know things I don't know
[00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:15.520]   "and I'm not even close to knowing.
[00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:17.640]   "So screw you." (laughs)
[00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:22.000]   And they will reject it aggressively.
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:22.920]   Like I've had,
[00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:27.000]   thankfully it's a percent,
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.160]   a time when I, you know, we do walk around magic
[00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:31.600]   and I go and some people, as soon as they see me go,
[00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:33.360]   "No, no, no, no thanks."
[00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:35.040]   They don't wanna see it.
[00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:37.920]   And to me, that drove me nuts.
[00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:39.320]   Like, why don't they wanna see?
[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:41.000]   They don't even know what I'm about to offer.
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:44.080]   - You're gonna violate their sense of self-trust.
[00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:45.200]   That's, I think, the fear.
[00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:46.360]   - Absolutely.
[00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:51.360]   And as a magician, or as an artist, if I use that,
[00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:57.160]   but my goal is to also educate them as I do the magic
[00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:01.560]   that we're creating this safe space
[00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:03.840]   where these things could happen.
[00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:07.880]   And it's clear that I'm using it for your own good.
[00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:10.680]   I, you know, I did a whole Foolish Act
[00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:13.240]   exactly about knowing and not knowing.
[00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:15.480]   So I'm not gonna spoil too much.
[00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:17.480]   If people wanna see it, they can see it.
[00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:21.560]   I'll tell you a backstory on this, if you don't mind.
[00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:25.800]   So Tommy, the three major heroes of magic
[00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:30.280]   are Juan Tamariz, Tommy Wonder, and Chan Canasta.
[00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:31.400]   - Are they alive still?
[00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:34.920]   - Chan is not, and Tommy passed.
[00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:37.920]   Juan is still kicking butt in Madrid.
[00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:39.440]   - I think I saw him at the castle.
[00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:42.280]   He's very exuberant.
[00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:43.520]   Yeah, okay.
[00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:48.520]   - So he's a hero, and I'm his student.
[00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:51.080]   So, but let's talk about Tommy for a sec.
[00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:55.880]   So Tommy, for a long time, he did magic
[00:49:55.880 --> 00:49:58.440]   that magicians did not know how it works.
[00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:00.280]   It was so devious that even magicians
[00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:01.520]   did not know how it works.
[00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:04.720]   And at some point, he released some DVDs
[00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:06.200]   that teach his magic.
[00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:08.760]   And the trick is very simple.
[00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:11.920]   He borrows someone's watch, it disappears,
[00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:14.360]   and there's a table right next to him
[00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:16.080]   with a little box and a ribbon.
[00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:18.880]   And he literally grabs the ribbon,
[00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:21.760]   so he never touches the box, lifts the box,
[00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:24.120]   gives it to somebody, he opens it.
[00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:26.960]   Inside, there's an alarm clock.
[00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:29.720]   They unscrew the alarm clock, and inside is their watch.
[00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:30.920]   - No.
[00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:31.960]   I mean, yes.
[00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:32.800]   (laughs)
[00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:35.680]   - Yes, but even magicians who saw that,
[00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:38.880]   they go, "I have no idea how it's done, no idea."
[00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:42.120]   And then, I remember watching the explanation
[00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:46.480]   for the first time, and I was thinking
[00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:51.240]   that the method was by far more interesting,
[00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:56.240]   intriguing, revealing, just beautiful.
[00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:58.800]   It made the trick less.
[00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:01.000]   Like, I said, "You should perform the explanation.
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:03.160]   "Don't perform the trick, perform the explanation."
[00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:06.600]   And I broke the rules of magic.
[00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:09.160]   Like, my non-magician friends will come over
[00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:10.200]   and say, "Let me share something."
[00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:11.120]   And I show them the trick, and they go,
[00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:12.000]   "Wow, that's amazing.
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:13.800]   "Let me show the explanation."
[00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:15.920]   And their mind was blown.
[00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:17.080]   - Are you willing to share a little bit
[00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:18.800]   of what the explanation is, or is that not--
[00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:19.920]   - No, no. - Okay.
[00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:22.000]   - But I will explain a little bit.
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:24.880]   So, the explanation was that it revealed
[00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:28.040]   that he's an engineer, that he can build props
[00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:30.680]   that are, like, ingenious.
[00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:34.080]   In some, again, I'm going around it,
[00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:37.880]   but at some point, the person who opens the box
[00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:40.680]   is doing part of the trick, and he doesn't know it.
[00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:43.080]   He's creating the trick, but he doesn't know
[00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:44.780]   he's contributing something to it.
[00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:47.420]   And it's just beautiful.
[00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:50.660]   Metaphorically, symbolically, it hits so many levels,
[00:51:50.660 --> 00:51:52.980]   at least, and that planted a seed in my mind.
[00:51:52.980 --> 00:51:57.140]   I wanna create an effect that the method
[00:51:57.140 --> 00:51:59.380]   is prettier than the trick itself.
[00:51:59.380 --> 00:52:03.060]   So, I worked for five years to create an explanation,
[00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:08.020]   a pseudo-explanation to a trick that was just beautiful.
[00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:11.900]   And it was an opportunity to, have you seen it?
[00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:12.740]   I don't know if you've--
[00:52:12.740 --> 00:52:13.580]   - This is the one you did for Penn & Teller.
[00:52:13.580 --> 00:52:14.420]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:16.820]   I, you can describe it, or I can describe it.
[00:52:16.820 --> 00:52:18.940]   - Sure, let's see how you remember it.
[00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:20.140]   - You're right.
[00:52:20.140 --> 00:52:23.300]   I have more interest in listening than speaking,
[00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:25.140]   but I'll tell you how I remember it.
[00:52:25.140 --> 00:52:25.980]   - Okay.
[00:52:25.980 --> 00:52:28.120]   - You're in a very, you're in front of a very large audience
[00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:33.120]   that includes the scientists/show guys at Penn & Teller
[00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:34.820]   who basically debunk stuff.
[00:52:34.820 --> 00:52:35.660]   They're kind of--
[00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:36.500]   - They try to figure it out.
[00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:37.620]   - They try and figure stuff out.
[00:52:37.620 --> 00:52:42.980]   Some, they are asked to pick someone in the audience.
[00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:44.740]   They pick a guy, as I recall,
[00:52:44.740 --> 00:52:46.580]   you wore a green and white sweater.
[00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:48.020]   - Wow, you have a good memory.
[00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:53.020]   - Yeah, he stands up and you ask him to pick a card.
[00:52:53.020 --> 00:52:57.260]   I think, I forget what it is, a jack of clubs, perhaps.
[00:52:57.260 --> 00:52:58.980]   Let's just say for sake of example, jack of clubs.
[00:52:58.980 --> 00:53:00.260]   You said, "Are you sure?"
[00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:02.020]   You're now on stage, mind you,
[00:53:02.020 --> 00:53:04.340]   there are hundreds of people in the audience, maybe more.
[00:53:04.340 --> 00:53:05.980]   And you say, "Are you sure?"
[00:53:05.980 --> 00:53:07.100]   And he goes, "Yeah."
[00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:08.620]   And then he goes, and you say, "Are you very sure?"
[00:53:08.620 --> 00:53:10.500]   And he said, "No, I'm gonna switch."
[00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:11.340]   So now it's--
[00:53:11.340 --> 00:53:12.860]   - First of all, you have a good memory.
[00:53:12.860 --> 00:53:13.700]   - Wow.
[00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:14.540]   - Perhaps, perhaps.
[00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:17.660]   I've been accused of, I have a little bit
[00:53:17.660 --> 00:53:20.260]   of an audiographic memory for certain things,
[00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:22.740]   but not a visual memory that's perfect.
[00:53:22.740 --> 00:53:24.220]   They're sort of adjacent.
[00:53:24.220 --> 00:53:25.300]   We could talk about that sometime.
[00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:26.580]   It's something, it helps you
[00:53:26.580 --> 00:53:28.300]   if you need to learn neuroanatomy.
[00:53:28.300 --> 00:53:29.940]   That's about it, it can be cultivated.
[00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:33.300]   Okay, so then he switches the card.
[00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:38.300]   Let's just call it, I don't know, jack of spades, right?
[00:53:38.300 --> 00:53:42.820]   Okay, or king of spades, let's say jack of spades.
[00:53:42.820 --> 00:53:47.820]   And then next to you on the table up on the stage
[00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:53.020]   is a table, a round table with a plexiglass box.
[00:53:53.020 --> 00:53:53.980]   - Cigar box.
[00:53:53.980 --> 00:53:55.340]   - Cigar box, it's clear.
[00:53:55.340 --> 00:53:56.500]   - No, no, not yet.
[00:53:56.500 --> 00:53:57.660]   - No? - Not yet, later.
[00:53:57.660 --> 00:53:58.500]   - Later, okay.
[00:53:58.500 --> 00:54:00.020]   - At first it's just a wooden cigar box.
[00:54:00.020 --> 00:54:00.860]   - A wooden box, that's right.
[00:54:00.860 --> 00:54:04.260]   And a mug, a white mug, not unlike the mug I have here,
[00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:07.140]   except white, you take a sip from that mug.
[00:54:07.140 --> 00:54:09.900]   And then at some point during this exchange,
[00:54:09.900 --> 00:54:14.900]   and then you open the box and you pull from the box,
[00:54:14.900 --> 00:54:18.620]   of course, the card that he selected.
[00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:21.140]   And everyone goes, oh my goodness,
[00:54:21.140 --> 00:54:23.260]   how could that possibly be?
[00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:25.820]   Because obviously anyone could have been selected
[00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:29.180]   in the audience, he switched his choice, et cetera.
[00:54:29.180 --> 00:54:31.340]   But then you reveal how the trick is done,
[00:54:31.340 --> 00:54:33.860]   or at least seemingly reveal it,
[00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:36.220]   which is that beneath the box,
[00:54:36.220 --> 00:54:38.860]   there's a bunch of different decks of cards.
[00:54:38.860 --> 00:54:40.580]   - 52. - 52 on a turnstile.
[00:54:40.580 --> 00:54:44.420]   So within each one, right, and I missed a piece of it.
[00:54:44.420 --> 00:54:45.460]   You pull out the whole deck
[00:54:45.460 --> 00:54:46.300]   and only one card is turned over.
[00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:48.180]   - Or in reverse and all the other cards are blank.
[00:54:48.180 --> 00:54:49.500]   - All the other cards are blank, right.
[00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:50.900]   So there's more to it.
[00:54:50.900 --> 00:54:52.880]   So then it turns out that there are 52 different decks
[00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:55.500]   underneath the table and it's on a turnstile,
[00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:56.740]   so you can actually dial it in.
[00:54:56.740 --> 00:54:58.660]   - And let's keep the ending surprise.
[00:54:58.660 --> 00:54:59.500]   - Right.
[00:54:59.500 --> 00:55:01.060]   - So there's a surprise ending to it.
[00:55:01.060 --> 00:55:04.940]   - Right, so then it at least seemingly makes sense
[00:55:04.940 --> 00:55:06.540]   as to how Asi did this.
[00:55:06.540 --> 00:55:09.940]   He has all the different possible options
[00:55:09.940 --> 00:55:11.540]   available to him physically,
[00:55:11.540 --> 00:55:13.260]   but the audience doesn't realize that.
[00:55:13.260 --> 00:55:16.260]   Also the mug, by the way, engages a magnet system
[00:55:16.260 --> 00:55:19.420]   that allows him to dial the deck of cards
[00:55:19.420 --> 00:55:21.660]   to the correct one that allows him to match the choice.
[00:55:21.660 --> 00:55:25.060]   So it truly could be any card in the deck.
[00:55:25.060 --> 00:55:25.900]   - Good memory.
[00:55:25.900 --> 00:55:28.580]   - Meaning it's all, so the straightforward explanation
[00:55:28.580 --> 00:55:31.700]   is it's all physical trickery by way of props.
[00:55:31.700 --> 00:55:32.540]   - Correct.
[00:55:32.540 --> 00:55:34.220]   So here's the deal.
[00:55:34.220 --> 00:55:36.540]   What I tried to achieve with this piece
[00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:39.740]   is first to make people feel magic.
[00:55:39.740 --> 00:55:41.740]   So the trick, it's a good trick.
[00:55:41.740 --> 00:55:45.820]   Name any card, the card he named was reversed,
[00:55:45.820 --> 00:55:48.300]   and then it was the only blue card in the deck,
[00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:49.760]   and then all the other cards were blank.
[00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:53.300]   So it's clearly the only card he could have named,
[00:55:53.300 --> 00:55:55.700]   and he did switch, which is an amazing detail
[00:55:55.700 --> 00:55:56.540]   that you remembered.
[00:55:56.540 --> 00:55:58.300]   He did switch from the king of clubs
[00:55:58.300 --> 00:55:59.740]   to the king of spades or vice versa.
[00:55:59.740 --> 00:56:00.760]   - Something like that, yeah.
[00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:05.600]   - Now, so people felt what it's like
[00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:08.800]   to see a good card trick, all right?
[00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:11.500]   And then I wanted them to feel what it's like to know.
[00:56:11.500 --> 00:56:17.640]   And the lesson here is you could satisfy your curiosity.
[00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:18.960]   Oh, that's how it's done,
[00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:22.200]   and you can go on with your life, and that's it.
[00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:24.680]   And that's what happens to a magician
[00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:28.840]   when you first learn the secrets to something that fooled you.
[00:56:28.840 --> 00:56:30.660]   There's disappointment.
[00:56:30.660 --> 00:56:33.200]   I remember the first trick that was revealed to me.
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:38.000]   It was a little red handkerchief stuffed into the hand,
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:39.980]   gone.
[00:56:39.980 --> 00:56:43.160]   And I'm like, what?
[00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:44.160]   Do it again.
[00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:45.240]   And he did it again.
[00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:48.840]   He did 10 times in a row.
[00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:51.680]   I couldn't, and then he explained to me how it's done.
[00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:56.720]   And the secret was so simple and stupid.
[00:56:56.720 --> 00:56:58.400]   I'm like, no, no.
[00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:00.000]   - Can that you share with us?
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:03.700]   - No, no, no, but I got to tell you, it was primitive.
[00:57:03.700 --> 00:57:07.780]   It was simple, and the moment he revealed the gimmick
[00:57:07.780 --> 00:57:10.160]   that caused the handkerchief to disappear,
[00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:12.940]   I could not see the trick again.
[00:57:12.940 --> 00:57:16.620]   Every time he does, it's this, yeah.
[00:57:16.620 --> 00:57:18.040]   - It's like falling out of love.
[00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:19.180]   (laughs)
[00:57:19.180 --> 00:57:20.560]   - Something like, yeah, that's true.
[00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:23.460]   - Really, I mean, a previous guest on the podcast,
[00:57:23.460 --> 00:57:25.900]   Karl Deisseroth, one of the best bioengineers,
[00:57:25.900 --> 00:57:28.820]   neuroscientists, and psychiatrists in the world,
[00:57:28.820 --> 00:57:30.600]   went on Lex Friedman podcast,
[00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:32.080]   and they were talking about love.
[00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:33.700]   And Karl said something interesting
[00:57:33.700 --> 00:57:35.240]   that's very relevant here.
[00:57:35.240 --> 00:57:39.020]   He said, he's a colleague of mine at Stanford,
[00:57:39.020 --> 00:57:40.780]   very poetic guy.
[00:57:40.780 --> 00:57:45.060]   He said, you know, love between two people,
[00:57:45.060 --> 00:57:49.340]   romantic love that is, is one of the few things in life
[00:57:49.340 --> 00:57:51.880]   that we collaborate with someone
[00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:54.200]   to story something into the future.
[00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:57.380]   You know, this is different than the love of a child
[00:57:57.380 --> 00:57:59.740]   or a sibling or a parent or a pet, et cetera,
[00:57:59.740 --> 00:58:01.420]   or a friend, right?
[00:58:01.420 --> 00:58:03.980]   You're creating a story that's based on real experience
[00:58:03.980 --> 00:58:05.560]   of past and present,
[00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:08.940]   but there's this storying forward of love.
[00:58:08.940 --> 00:58:09.780]   - That's great.
[00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:12.720]   - And falling out of love involves, of course,
[00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:14.540]   the ending of the story moving forward,
[00:58:14.540 --> 00:58:18.420]   but also in some cases, sadly,
[00:58:18.420 --> 00:58:22.000]   a revision of the events of the past.
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:24.860]   - It's great.
[00:58:24.860 --> 00:58:26.620]   It's very close.
[00:58:26.620 --> 00:58:31.180]   It's very close to the feeling you have as a magician
[00:58:31.180 --> 00:58:35.860]   the first time you actually get exposed, right?
[00:58:35.860 --> 00:58:39.780]   It disappoints you because you have a desire
[00:58:39.780 --> 00:58:42.360]   for it to be real.
[00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:45.460]   The desire of a young magician
[00:58:45.460 --> 00:58:46.540]   is when I see something like that
[00:58:46.540 --> 00:58:49.020]   is that it's a supernatural power.
[00:58:49.020 --> 00:58:51.700]   And the first thing you understand
[00:58:51.700 --> 00:58:53.500]   is that it's not supernatural,
[00:58:53.500 --> 00:58:55.840]   that it's quite simple and primitive.
[00:58:56.840 --> 00:58:59.960]   And it fooled you because of all the psychology
[00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:02.200]   and the desire, like everything we spoke about,
[00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:04.040]   my desire to see magic,
[00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:07.580]   the fact of the idea of misdirection,
[00:59:07.580 --> 00:59:09.280]   which we can talk about at length.
[00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:14.200]   Misdirection means I provide something
[00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:16.320]   very interesting for you to follow.
[00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:19.320]   And you will follow that path
[00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:22.580]   because it's the most interesting at the moment to follow.
[00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:28.320]   And in the background, in the shadiness of life,
[00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:31.300]   some dirty stuff happen,
[00:59:31.300 --> 00:59:32.400]   but you don't pay attention to it
[00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:33.720]   because I don't feature it.
[00:59:33.720 --> 00:59:35.040]   It's not important.
[00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:37.320]   And I make you render it as not important.
[00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:39.900]   So it does that, right?
[00:59:39.900 --> 00:59:42.560]   And it's disappointment.
[00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:44.320]   But there's good news.
[00:59:44.320 --> 00:59:47.160]   If you keep up with magic and you start to understand
[00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:49.720]   that to do a trick, the secret,
[00:59:51.640 --> 00:59:56.160]   the actual how you did it is 1% of the whole procedure.
[00:59:56.160 --> 01:00:00.840]   And there's much more to doing that trick effectively,
[01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:03.680]   which is storytelling, connecting,
[01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:09.920]   doing it in such a way that somebody cares about it.
[01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:14.920]   And that is a lifetime of pondering and contemplation.
[01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:17.640]   So you have,
[01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:20.240]   maybe you'll find an analogy with love again.
[01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:21.160]   I don't know.
[01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:24.960]   There's also this time when you start appreciating it again,
[01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:27.000]   appreciate the secret again,
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.240]   because you understand the nuance.
[01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:33.560]   You understand the complexity of this simple thing.
[01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:35.680]   And that's what happened to me.
[01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:39.120]   So in some magic, which is the exception,
[01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:41.400]   it's the table that we spoke about that I didn't fool us,
[01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:43.500]   or Tommy Wanderer's table,
[01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:47.440]   where the effect is so, so, so magnificent
[01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:49.000]   that you do appreciate it immediately.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.600]   But those are rare.
[01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:55.240]   Most magic is simple, dirty, and to the point.
[01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:59.520]   But it achieves something that looks very complex.
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:03.520]   - Perhaps now would be the appropriate time
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:07.560]   for you to reveal the non-reveal
[01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:09.200]   of the explanation of the trick.
[01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:11.360]   Because one of the amazing things
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:15.240]   about the trick that you did with selecting the card
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:17.760]   that the gentleman in the audience, a pen and teller,
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:20.880]   had mentally and verbally selected
[01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:23.000]   is that at the very end,
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.760]   after everyone believes they now understand
[01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:28.220]   how the trick is done, the turn foul table,
[01:01:28.220 --> 01:01:30.340]   the magnet, the coffee mug,
[01:01:30.340 --> 01:01:33.720]   you proceed to strip away the-
[01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:34.560]   - The curtain.
[01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:35.380]   - The curtain around the table
[01:01:35.380 --> 01:01:40.280]   and pull out a piece of paper, not 52 decks of cards.
[01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:41.120]   - It's a picture of 52.
[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:43.720]   - It's a picture, which means that the explanation
[01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:47.320]   that they got, while entirely plausible,
[01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:48.820]   if that's actually what had happened
[01:01:48.820 --> 01:01:50.080]   is not at all what had happened.
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:53.080]   In other words, you pop out at the end
[01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:55.440]   that they don't actually know how it's done.
[01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:56.400]   You know how it's done,
[01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:59.240]   and I'm not even going to bother to ask you how it's done
[01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:00.240]   because you're not going to reveal it.
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:02.360]   In other words, people were misdirected
[01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:04.280]   into thinking they understood the trick,
[01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:07.320]   and therefore kind of there's a bit of a letdown.
[01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:11.480]   It's interesting, but it's just mechanics, magnets.
[01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:14.480]   And then you reveal that their understanding
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:16.560]   is actually not real.
[01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:19.860]   - Yes, and the reason I wanted to go there,
[01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:23.000]   I wanted them to feel magic,
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.960]   then to feel what it's like to know something
[01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:28.320]   and the fact that it's irreversible.
[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:31.440]   You can't unknow a trick once you know how it's done.
[01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:34.000]   And then what I said, look, I made a choice.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.920]   I chose to learn the secrets to magic,
[01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:37.080]   and I'm paying a price for it.
[01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:39.520]   I cannot see magic the way you can.
[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:42.800]   I cannot enjoy it the way my audience can.
[01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:44.600]   And in a weird way, I'm experiencing magic
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:46.140]   only through their eyes.
[01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:48.440]   When I see somebody goes, wow,
[01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:51.160]   through you I can experience it, but that's it.
[01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:56.160]   I cannot firsthand experience magic the way you can.
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:59.200]   So I said, I'm not here to make that choice for you.
[01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:02.060]   So let me bring you back to safety,
[01:03:02.060 --> 01:03:03.420]   to the place you were at.
[01:03:03.420 --> 01:03:07.780]   It's a place I envy, to mystery.
[01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:11.080]   And then I revealed that the whole explanation was bogus.
[01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:13.440]   The whole thing was just another lie.
[01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:16.980]   And I'm establishing another thing that as a magician,
[01:03:16.980 --> 01:03:19.220]   I have a license to lie to you.
[01:03:19.220 --> 01:03:21.940]   And it's okay, 'cause that's my job.
[01:03:21.940 --> 01:03:23.460]   And therefore it makes it honest.
[01:03:23.460 --> 01:03:25.500]   - And we're collaborating in that to some extent,
[01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:27.340]   because when people go to a magic show,
[01:03:27.340 --> 01:03:28.420]   they understand that.
[01:03:28.420 --> 01:03:31.780]   Another former guest on the podcast, Rick Rubin,
[01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:33.920]   who needs no introduction,
[01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:36.240]   but by the way, he's a big fan of magic,
[01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:41.240]   has said to me before that there are only two things in life
[01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:43.380]   that are absolutely true.
[01:03:43.380 --> 01:03:44.880]   One is nature, right?
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:45.720]   They're real truths.
[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:48.360]   They're real laws and rules of nature.
[01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:51.680]   And the other is for him, professional wrestling,
[01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:54.200]   because Rick loves professional wrestling.
[01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:57.640]   He's a lifetime member of the AEW and the WWE.
[01:03:57.640 --> 01:03:59.400]   I've gone to see wrestling with him.
[01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:01.480]   And the reason he believes it's one of the few things
[01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:04.800]   that's real is that everyone knows it's not real.
[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:07.120]   And so everyone agrees to collaborate in this story,
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:09.600]   this theater of these guys hate each other.
[01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:11.780]   This woman and this woman are now friends.
[01:04:11.780 --> 01:04:14.300]   They are collaborators, and so unlike everything else,
[01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:15.800]   which is completely made up,
[01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:19.180]   and you're not sure what's real and what's fake,
[01:04:19.180 --> 01:04:21.440]   with professional wrestling and with nature,
[01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:22.680]   it's a real truth.
[01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:23.880]   I would add to that magic,
[01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:26.480]   because when we go to see magic,
[01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:31.080]   we want to be astonished, and most people do.
[01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:36.080]   We want our perceptions to be violated, right?
[01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:39.480]   What we believe is there isn't there, et cetera.
[01:04:40.540 --> 01:04:44.040]   And yet we are doing this consensually.
[01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:45.800]   We're doing this, and so we're agreeing.
[01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:48.160]   Like, let's collaborate in a lie
[01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:51.240]   that there's this thing called magic, I guess,
[01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:53.280]   and that's a pretty ill-defined term in its own right,
[01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:55.720]   where this idea that physical objects
[01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:56.600]   can be made to disappear,
[01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:59.320]   violate the rules of nature, of physics.
[01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:03.400]   And unless you're of a certain ilk out there in the world,
[01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:05.160]   that simply is not the case.
[01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:08.040]   The laws of nature hold, so.
[01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:09.860]   - Maybe there's another analogy there,
[01:05:09.860 --> 01:05:14.480]   because we know that professional wrestlers are faking it.
[01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:17.480]   And we know a magician fakes it, too.
[01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:19.640]   He fakes supernatural powers.
[01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:21.520]   - Right, they're doing real things in wrestling,
[01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:23.560]   but they're not actually trying to harm one another.
[01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:24.440]   - Correct. - Right.
[01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:26.120]   They're collaborating.
[01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:28.280]   - But it's almost a choreographed fight, right?
[01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:29.560]   - Yes, I think there's some,
[01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:31.820]   my understanding is, based on discussions with Rick
[01:05:31.820 --> 01:05:35.960]   and professional wrestlers that Rick has introduced me to,
[01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:38.660]   is that there's some room for improvisation,
[01:05:38.660 --> 01:05:42.200]   and occasionally people will hurt one another accidentally.
[01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:45.080]   Sometimes there are real conflicts that are created.
[01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:46.120]   Just like in the theater,
[01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:48.640]   people will have relationships offstage, et cetera,
[01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:49.920]   and it creates conflict onstage.
[01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:52.000]   And that's where the theater of life
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.640]   meets the theater of the stage, and vice versa.
[01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:58.080]   - So I would add to that, maybe, maybe I'm wrong,
[01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:00.480]   that you do a magic show,
[01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:04.160]   and an educated person, a smart person
[01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:08.560]   who knows that what I do is trickery, conjuring,
[01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:12.180]   but every now and then they might ask,
[01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:14.740]   I wonder if that was real.
[01:06:14.740 --> 01:06:17.960]   That little part he just did, maybe that was real.
[01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:20.880]   So there's a moment, I think, in magic,
[01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:24.340]   where even the smartest guy who knows I do tricks,
[01:06:24.340 --> 01:06:26.340]   they go, yeah, this is all tricks,
[01:06:26.340 --> 01:06:30.180]   but maybe what he just did now, maybe that was real.
[01:06:30.180 --> 01:06:31.740]   - Like when you say real, you mean--
[01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:33.380]   - Real magic. - It violates the rules
[01:06:33.380 --> 01:06:34.220]   of physics. - Real magic.
[01:06:34.220 --> 01:06:36.480]   - So taking a card, holding it up,
[01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:37.880]   clenching your fist, making it disappear.
[01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:39.260]   I'm giving simple, kind of silly--
[01:06:39.260 --> 01:06:41.740]   - Or mind reading, or as they say,
[01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:44.420]   maybe he's able to do those things psychologically
[01:06:44.420 --> 01:06:45.360]   or whatnot, right?
[01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:48.340]   And maybe that happens also in wrestling.
[01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:49.300]   They say, yeah, it's fake,
[01:06:49.300 --> 01:06:51.640]   but I think that moment was real.
[01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:54.420]   So there's an inkling or moments where,
[01:06:54.420 --> 01:06:57.040]   'cause I think to create this drama,
[01:06:57.040 --> 01:07:00.180]   and to me, that exists in magic.
[01:07:00.180 --> 01:07:02.140]   Is he real, is he fake?
[01:07:02.140 --> 01:07:03.980]   Did I figure it out or did I not figure it out?
[01:07:03.980 --> 01:07:05.180]   Am I close or am I not?
[01:07:05.180 --> 01:07:07.660]   There's constant conflict in a magic show
[01:07:07.660 --> 01:07:08.700]   that you go in and out of.
[01:07:08.700 --> 01:07:11.060]   And I wonder if that happens in wrestling as well,
[01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:12.260]   where you know it's fake,
[01:07:12.260 --> 01:07:14.600]   but maybe there's something that was real,
[01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:17.600]   or this happened and that was not planned.
[01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:22.180]   So I think that this, just the thinking,
[01:07:22.180 --> 01:07:26.260]   the fact that you invest it into thinking what is real
[01:07:26.260 --> 01:07:29.260]   and what is not is intriguing.
[01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:30.740]   - I'd like to just take a quick break
[01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:33.780]   and acknowledge one of our sponsors, InsideTracker.
[01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:36.380]   InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[01:07:36.380 --> 01:07:39.020]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[01:07:39.020 --> 01:07:40.660]   to help you better understand your body
[01:07:40.660 --> 01:07:42.620]   and help you reach your health goals.
[01:07:42.620 --> 01:07:43.820]   Now, I've long been a believer
[01:07:43.820 --> 01:07:46.500]   in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason
[01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:48.900]   that many of the factors that impact our immediate
[01:07:48.900 --> 01:07:51.140]   and long-term health can only be addressed.
[01:07:51.140 --> 01:07:54.500]   That is, can only be measured with a quality blood test.
[01:07:54.500 --> 01:07:56.380]   Now, one issue with many blood tests out there
[01:07:56.380 --> 01:07:58.860]   is that you get information back about lipid levels,
[01:07:58.860 --> 01:08:01.300]   hormone levels, metabolic factors, et cetera,
[01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:03.440]   but you don't know what to do with that information.
[01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:05.160]   With InsideTracker, they make it very easy
[01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:07.780]   to understand your levels and what they mean
[01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:10.620]   and specific actionable items that you can undertake
[01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:12.740]   in order to bring those levels into the ranges
[01:08:12.740 --> 01:08:14.100]   that are optimal for you.
[01:08:14.100 --> 01:08:17.100]   InsideTracker also offers InsideTracker Pro,
[01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:19.340]   which enables coaches and health professionals
[01:08:19.340 --> 01:08:21.860]   to provide premium and personalized services
[01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:23.780]   by leveraging InsideTracker's analysis
[01:08:23.780 --> 01:08:25.900]   and recommendations with their clients.

[01:08:36.660 --> 01:08:38.660]   I think there's a much larger theme here
[01:08:38.660 --> 01:08:40.980]   that we're veering toward and I'm getting excited
[01:08:40.980 --> 01:08:43.780]   because this has to do with how the brain works
[01:08:43.780 --> 01:08:46.280]   and there are examples in different domains,
[01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:47.700]   but two come to mind now.
[01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:51.020]   Rick and I sometimes hang out here in Los Angeles
[01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:53.180]   and there's a place where we do sauna and cold
[01:08:53.180 --> 01:08:54.660]   and it looks out on the ocean.
[01:08:54.660 --> 01:08:58.340]   And Rick once turned to me and said,
[01:08:58.340 --> 01:09:00.540]   you know, isn't it interesting?
[01:09:00.540 --> 01:09:02.100]   You know, we know that there are all these animals
[01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:04.900]   under the water, dolphins and whales and all this stuff,
[01:09:04.900 --> 01:09:09.900]   sharks, but when we see a dolphin or a group of dolphins
[01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:13.060]   or we see a whale breach,
[01:09:13.060 --> 01:09:16.420]   it's like people are just delighted.
[01:09:16.420 --> 01:09:17.660]   Now they're beautiful animals,
[01:09:17.660 --> 01:09:20.700]   but oftentimes it's just a tail slapping the top.
[01:09:20.700 --> 01:09:22.220]   And I think, and he said,
[01:09:22.220 --> 01:09:24.800]   I wonder if it's because it reminds us
[01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:28.160]   of how much is going on there underneath the surface.
[01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:31.660]   And I love that because I think, A, he's right.
[01:09:31.660 --> 01:09:33.420]   You know, I've done some snorkeling, some scuba diving.
[01:09:33.420 --> 01:09:36.260]   You see lots of stuff and it's a brilliant experience
[01:09:36.260 --> 01:09:38.180]   to see all that and to be a fish of sorts
[01:09:38.180 --> 01:09:39.260]   and be breathing underwater.
[01:09:39.260 --> 01:09:42.220]   But there is something magnificent
[01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:45.900]   about seeing an aquatic animal breach the surface.
[01:09:45.900 --> 01:09:47.860]   And it goes beyond just seeing the animal.
[01:09:47.860 --> 01:09:49.820]   It's like a reminder of all these other things
[01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:50.660]   that are likely happening
[01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:53.420]   that are outside our usual perception.
[01:09:53.420 --> 01:09:55.740]   And so that's what comes to mind there.
[01:09:55.740 --> 01:09:58.740]   And then I had another example, but I can't think of it now,
[01:09:58.740 --> 01:10:02.620]   where, oh, it's in sports.
[01:10:02.620 --> 01:10:04.600]   You know, I always think of there's unskilled skilled,
[01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:07.980]   mastery and virtuosity, and virtuosity in music,
[01:10:07.980 --> 01:10:12.140]   like Yo-Yo Ma, or in sport, I don't know,
[01:10:12.140 --> 01:10:13.340]   pick up, I don't know, Michael Jordan,
[01:10:13.340 --> 01:10:14.580]   whatever favorite sport.
[01:10:14.580 --> 01:10:16.740]   This idea that maybe they don't even know
[01:10:16.740 --> 01:10:17.900]   what they're gonna do next.
[01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:19.620]   That there's some improvisation
[01:10:19.620 --> 01:10:22.540]   at the level of extreme mastery,
[01:10:22.540 --> 01:10:26.380]   where you're gonna see something you've never seen before.
[01:10:26.380 --> 01:10:28.100]   And I think that's what delights people.
[01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:29.940]   It's not just about getting the ball into the end zone
[01:10:29.940 --> 01:10:32.240]   or the ball into the basket or playing a piece of music.
[01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:34.260]   It's the idea of something happening for the first time.
[01:10:34.260 --> 01:10:36.500]   And maybe again, as with the earlier example,
[01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:39.060]   that the person performing, the athlete, the musician,
[01:10:39.060 --> 01:10:42.260]   et cetera, the magician, the mentalist,
[01:10:42.260 --> 01:10:46.140]   they themselves are delighted by what just happened.
[01:10:46.140 --> 01:10:47.880]   They didn't even realize it was gonna happen.
[01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:50.900]   And you collaborate in this, like, wow,
[01:10:50.900 --> 01:10:53.700]   life holds far more than I experience
[01:10:53.700 --> 01:10:57.200]   in my daily perceptual kind of framework.
[01:10:57.200 --> 01:10:59.100]   Yeah, could very well could be.
[01:10:59.100 --> 01:11:01.380]   And I think your shows bring people to that.
[01:11:01.380 --> 01:11:04.080]   I wanna return to a couple of ideas.
[01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:05.620]   First of all, we've been talking about emotion
[01:11:05.620 --> 01:11:06.740]   and collaboration a lot.
[01:11:06.740 --> 01:11:07.940]   - Sure.
[01:11:07.940 --> 01:11:10.100]   - We've had a guest on the podcast, David Spiegel.
[01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:11.940]   He's our Associate Chair of Psychiatry at Stanford,
[01:11:11.940 --> 01:11:14.460]   who does clinical hypnosis,
[01:11:14.460 --> 01:11:16.700]   which brings people into a state of calm
[01:11:16.700 --> 01:11:18.720]   plus a very constrained context
[01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:20.960]   where they're more likely to think about certain things
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:21.980]   than others.
[01:11:21.980 --> 01:11:25.320]   How much of what you do with an individual
[01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:30.320]   or group of people in your craft involves hypnosis,
[01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:31.720]   constraining the context.
[01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:35.280]   In other words, eliminating certain patterns of thinking
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:38.120]   to make other certain patterns of thinking more likely.
[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:40.160]   Is that like a storytelling?
[01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:42.040]   Like you start telling me a story, a horror story,
[01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:43.800]   or a mystery, or a comedy story,
[01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:46.680]   I'm shutting down whatever you're not talking about.
[01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:48.400]   Is that something that you do?
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:51.640]   - Yeah, so first of all, we have theatrical hypnosis.
[01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:53.720]   People that do shows where they get,
[01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:55.720]   they gather about 20 people on stage
[01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:58.480]   and they start making them dance like chickens, right?
[01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:04.920]   I've never been full on with this type of performances
[01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:06.080]   for various reasons.
[01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:09.520]   It's just, to me, that's not the best way for me
[01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:14.520]   to engage with an audience or to manipulate them.
[01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:19.880]   However, there's certain things that we do in magic
[01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:24.800]   that if you say certain things in a certain way,
[01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:27.260]   it will produce a certain answer.
[01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:33.160]   And it amazes me too, like there's some,
[01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:35.880]   we call them psychological forces,
[01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:40.120]   that you say a string of words in a certain order
[01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:45.120]   and it will produce with high percentage a yes or no,
[01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:48.920]   or I want this and not that.
[01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:53.200]   - Like would you wanna pick this deck of cards
[01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:55.640]   or that deck of cards type leading?
[01:12:55.640 --> 01:12:57.800]   - That could be the simplest of the idea,
[01:12:57.800 --> 01:13:00.660]   but it could be even more complex than that.
[01:13:00.660 --> 01:13:04.680]   And it amazes me because it's almost like a recipe.
[01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:07.840]   You follow the recipe, put it in the oven, boom, okay.
[01:13:09.020 --> 01:13:14.020]   But there's, in magic, when I say certain things,
[01:13:14.020 --> 01:13:17.540]   there's a moment when I'm waiting for you to say something
[01:13:17.540 --> 01:13:21.220]   and I don't know if you're gonna follow what I just did.
[01:13:21.220 --> 01:13:24.880]   And then I hear it and I go, there's a joy.
[01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:26.420]   It's like, yes, it worked.
[01:13:26.420 --> 01:13:28.420]   - And this reveals something fundamental about the brain.
[01:13:28.420 --> 01:13:29.940]   For instance, I could imagine if,
[01:13:29.940 --> 01:13:32.060]   let me have two mugs in front of me for those listening.
[01:13:32.060 --> 01:13:35.100]   If I hover my finger on one of them longer than others
[01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:37.340]   and I say, would you like to drink from this mug
[01:13:37.340 --> 01:13:40.620]   and keep it there for 10 seconds, or this one?
[01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:42.460]   And I just tap the other one briefly,
[01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:43.900]   do you think you bias the probability
[01:13:43.900 --> 01:13:45.380]   of which one somebody will pick?
[01:13:45.380 --> 01:13:48.740]   - Absolutely, because, and that's a great example.
[01:13:48.740 --> 01:13:52.660]   It depends on my character.
[01:13:52.660 --> 01:13:55.480]   First, I need to know who I'm doing it to.
[01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:56.420]   Are you the challenger?
[01:13:56.420 --> 01:13:58.100]   Are you the guy who's gonna go with anything?
[01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:00.740]   - Okay, let's say it's the guy who'll go with anything.
[01:14:00.740 --> 01:14:01.660]   - There's a likelihood he will go
[01:14:01.660 --> 01:14:03.900]   with the one you touch longer, but if it's the challenger,
[01:14:03.900 --> 01:14:07.300]   he will say, oh, I see what's happening here.
[01:14:07.300 --> 01:14:09.460]   Andrew is trying to make me take this one
[01:14:09.460 --> 01:14:11.700]   and therefore I'm gonna take that one.
[01:14:11.700 --> 01:14:16.940]   And that's the simplest idea of challenges.
[01:14:16.940 --> 01:14:19.500]   - And I could challenge you again and say, with doubt,
[01:14:19.500 --> 01:14:20.340]   and then I could say,
[01:14:20.340 --> 01:14:21.860]   are you sure you want the one that I tapped?
[01:14:21.860 --> 01:14:23.740]   Just briefly, I'm not telling you that way,
[01:14:23.740 --> 01:14:24.860]   but I'd say, are you sure?
[01:14:24.860 --> 01:14:28.420]   And if you say, yes, you're challenging me again,
[01:14:28.420 --> 01:14:30.260]   and now I'm certain you're a challenger.
[01:14:30.260 --> 01:14:31.740]   So you're collecting data, basically.
[01:14:31.740 --> 01:14:32.580]   - You're collecting data,
[01:14:32.580 --> 01:14:36.140]   and because I've done it thousands of times,
[01:14:36.140 --> 01:14:40.700]   I do the exact same spiel, the same order of events,
[01:14:40.700 --> 01:14:42.740]   and I get to try it.
[01:14:42.740 --> 01:14:45.100]   And sometimes I'll say, okay, let's phrase it differently.
[01:14:45.100 --> 01:14:46.300]   You know, there's routines where I do
[01:14:46.300 --> 01:14:49.980]   when I need someone to say a certain something.
[01:14:49.980 --> 01:14:53.620]   And I don't just rely on the psychological force.
[01:14:53.620 --> 01:14:57.940]   I have other tools in my arsenal of tools.
[01:14:57.940 --> 01:15:05.140]   But it surprises me, the percentage, the rate.
[01:15:06.140 --> 01:15:09.500]   And that's what Chan did a lot.
[01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:12.500]   He understood the idea that if people feel challenged,
[01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:13.340]   they do this.
[01:15:13.340 --> 01:15:16.300]   If they feel like maybe that you're desperate
[01:15:16.300 --> 01:15:18.940]   for them to change, they'll act a different way.
[01:15:18.940 --> 01:15:20.340]   And again, I'm tiptoeing again,
[01:15:20.340 --> 01:15:23.540]   because I don't want to demystify magic here.
[01:15:23.540 --> 01:15:27.300]   I'm trying to say that there's a real way for,
[01:15:27.300 --> 01:15:30.940]   and you know, Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky,
[01:15:30.940 --> 01:15:33.300]   they talk about it in their work.
[01:15:33.300 --> 01:15:35.580]   You know, "Thinking Fast and Slow," for example,
[01:15:35.580 --> 01:15:37.900]   which to us is a magic book.
[01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:39.980]   How people make decisions.
[01:15:39.980 --> 01:15:43.820]   And they often say, if you phrase a question one way
[01:15:43.820 --> 01:15:45.620]   versus another way,
[01:15:45.620 --> 01:15:48.020]   and even though the same thing is at stake,
[01:15:48.020 --> 01:15:50.220]   it's the same equation.
[01:15:50.220 --> 01:15:52.500]   If you phrase it this way, they'll prefer that.
[01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:55.380]   If you phrase it that way, they prefer the other one.
[01:15:55.380 --> 01:15:56.780]   And it makes no sense.
[01:15:56.780 --> 01:15:58.660]   'Cause that's the bottom line.
[01:15:58.660 --> 01:15:59.980]   It's like, which one do you want?
[01:15:59.980 --> 01:16:03.860]   - Well, I think the brain runs algorithms.
[01:16:03.860 --> 01:16:07.580]   And some of it's historical in how we are raised.
[01:16:07.580 --> 01:16:08.620]   I'll give an example.
[01:16:08.620 --> 01:16:10.980]   A friend of mine has twins.
[01:16:10.980 --> 01:16:13.340]   And I said, "How's it going with the twins?"
[01:16:13.340 --> 01:16:17.300]   Describe their personalities and how they differ.
[01:16:17.300 --> 01:16:19.940]   And he said that one of his twin daughters,
[01:16:19.940 --> 01:16:21.820]   no matter what you tell her, she says,
[01:16:21.820 --> 01:16:23.620]   "No, she challenges you."
[01:16:23.620 --> 01:16:26.980]   But not as a way to disengage, as a way to engage.
[01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:28.020]   - Nice, interesting.
[01:16:28.020 --> 01:16:29.180]   - Yeah, interesting.
[01:16:29.180 --> 01:16:35.340]   And the other one is very willing to engage in things,
[01:16:35.340 --> 01:16:40.060]   doesn't challenge, but engages through active collaboration.
[01:16:40.060 --> 01:16:41.380]   When we had Chris Voss,
[01:16:41.380 --> 01:16:43.660]   a former FBI negotiator here on the podcast,
[01:16:43.660 --> 01:16:46.220]   he said one way to get information from people
[01:16:46.220 --> 01:16:48.940]   in these scenarios he used to do before is,
[01:16:48.940 --> 01:16:52.420]   instead of asking them a question, you give a hypothesis.
[01:16:52.420 --> 01:16:54.660]   You keep your hair really nice.
[01:16:54.660 --> 01:16:55.580]   You got great hair.
[01:16:55.580 --> 01:16:59.540]   You must spend a lot of money on clothes.
[01:16:59.540 --> 01:17:03.020]   Now, people will respond, he tells me,
[01:17:03.020 --> 01:17:06.460]   by either agreeing, yes, or no,
[01:17:06.460 --> 01:17:07.540]   I don't really spend a lot of money.
[01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:09.340]   You just got information, but you're not asking,
[01:17:09.340 --> 01:17:10.540]   do you spend a lot of money on clothes?
[01:17:10.540 --> 01:17:12.780]   You basically state a hypothesis.
[01:17:12.780 --> 01:17:15.940]   And then they are either going to accept
[01:17:15.940 --> 01:17:17.300]   or refute your hypothesis.
[01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:21.420]   And people almost reflexively respond to hypotheses
[01:17:21.420 --> 01:17:24.940]   about them from others by wanting to defend the truth.
[01:17:25.620 --> 01:17:28.060]   And that's a way that FBI negotiators
[01:17:28.060 --> 01:17:29.220]   and others get information.
[01:17:29.220 --> 01:17:31.060]   Rather than ask questions, give them hypotheses
[01:17:31.060 --> 01:17:32.460]   and people will defend their truth
[01:17:32.460 --> 01:17:33.900]   to the point of giving up information
[01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:34.900]   they wouldn't otherwise.
[01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:35.740]   - Yeah.
[01:17:35.740 --> 01:17:38.580]   And if you wanna, I know you're here for me
[01:17:38.580 --> 01:17:41.060]   to reveal my tricks, so I'll reveal something.
[01:17:41.060 --> 01:17:44.580]   Hypnotists, they do this quite a bit,
[01:17:44.580 --> 01:17:47.780]   and it's a beautiful strategy of doing it.
[01:17:47.780 --> 01:17:49.660]   They'll make a few statements.
[01:17:49.660 --> 01:17:51.540]   And they're simple statements.
[01:17:51.540 --> 01:17:52.780]   They're accurate.
[01:17:52.780 --> 01:17:54.620]   You can argue with those statements.
[01:17:54.620 --> 01:17:58.060]   They ring true and you believe them.
[01:17:58.060 --> 01:18:00.100]   And then maybe the last thing they're gonna say
[01:18:00.100 --> 01:18:03.940]   is not quite true.
[01:18:03.940 --> 01:18:06.980]   But because you average the information
[01:18:06.980 --> 01:18:10.340]   and you go, okay, he's speaking the truth now.
[01:18:10.340 --> 01:18:11.940]   He's telling us the truth.
[01:18:11.940 --> 01:18:13.980]   But in between those statements,
[01:18:13.980 --> 01:18:16.700]   there's some inaccuracies there
[01:18:16.700 --> 01:18:19.820]   that are starting to manipulate you,
[01:18:19.820 --> 01:18:22.020]   but they're half truth.
[01:18:23.900 --> 01:18:26.500]   Like, for example, I'll say this is a round table, right?
[01:18:26.500 --> 01:18:29.500]   And you can feel the light, right?
[01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:31.940]   Even if you close your eyes, you could feel the light.
[01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:35.020]   And you can even feel, even if you didn't know,
[01:18:35.020 --> 01:18:37.100]   that this is a bigger light than this one
[01:18:37.100 --> 01:18:38.900]   because of the heat.
[01:18:38.900 --> 01:18:42.300]   Now, this might be a false statement, but it makes sense.
[01:18:42.300 --> 01:18:44.140]   - And you can start to feel heat on one side.
[01:18:44.140 --> 01:18:47.660]   - And you start to go, yeah, it's logical.
[01:18:47.660 --> 01:18:51.460]   It's very sensical, therefore it's true.
[01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:52.980]   But it's a half truth.
[01:18:52.980 --> 01:18:54.860]   Maybe if we measured that this is a stronger light,
[01:18:54.860 --> 01:18:56.100]   who knows?
[01:18:56.100 --> 01:18:59.620]   But, and I say, and you feel there's a bit of a hum here.
[01:18:59.620 --> 01:19:05.140]   And the more you focus on it, and it's getting louder.
[01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:07.340]   Now, because you're paying attention to it,
[01:19:07.340 --> 01:19:08.580]   it's getting louder.
[01:19:08.580 --> 01:19:11.900]   It's not getting louder, actually.
[01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:13.460]   - You're guiding perception.
[01:19:13.460 --> 01:19:14.300]   - Exactly.
[01:19:14.300 --> 01:19:18.980]   I'm directing your attention to the things I want you to.
[01:19:18.980 --> 01:19:21.020]   You heard a plane?
[01:19:22.060 --> 01:19:23.180]   It's an illusion.
[01:19:23.180 --> 01:19:24.460]   No, it's a real plane.
[01:19:24.460 --> 01:19:26.420]   So, you know, but this is something
[01:19:26.420 --> 01:19:29.420]   that hypnotists do very well, you know?
[01:19:29.420 --> 01:19:32.100]   Guiding you, you know, going to NLP and all that,
[01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:32.940]   it's all related.
[01:19:32.940 --> 01:19:37.940]   The idea of like sounding like they're telling you
[01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:41.900]   things that should make sense and they're accurate,
[01:19:41.900 --> 01:19:43.260]   but they're not.
[01:19:43.260 --> 01:19:44.820]   They're sort of accurate.
[01:19:44.820 --> 01:19:46.260]   And it becomes more and more ridiculous
[01:19:46.260 --> 01:19:48.420]   until they tell you, dance like a chicken.
[01:19:48.420 --> 01:19:49.900]   And then you dance like a chicken.
[01:19:49.900 --> 01:19:54.900]   - Yeah, it's so interesting because perception
[01:19:54.900 --> 01:19:56.700]   obviously is governed by the brain,
[01:19:56.700 --> 01:19:59.420]   at least in part brain and body, but nervous system.
[01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:04.420]   And we have essentially two attentional spotlights,
[01:20:04.420 --> 01:20:07.180]   meaning we can pay attention to two things at the same time,
[01:20:07.180 --> 01:20:08.780]   but probably not five.
[01:20:08.780 --> 01:20:10.340]   And we can merge those spotlights
[01:20:10.340 --> 01:20:12.660]   and we can make them more intense, so to speak,
[01:20:12.660 --> 01:20:14.460]   where we can dim them and make them more diffuse.
[01:20:14.460 --> 01:20:15.300]   You know, there's a bunch of things
[01:20:15.300 --> 01:20:17.340]   that we can do with attentional spotlighting.
[01:20:17.340 --> 01:20:18.180]   What you're talking about here
[01:20:18.180 --> 01:20:21.380]   is attentional spotlighting, bringing people's perception
[01:20:21.380 --> 01:20:23.700]   to real things that are happening,
[01:20:23.700 --> 01:20:25.700]   but heightening one's perception of those,
[01:20:25.700 --> 01:20:28.260]   so getting more granularity on what's happening.
[01:20:28.260 --> 01:20:30.380]   But like right now I'm in contact with,
[01:20:30.380 --> 01:20:31.860]   physical contact with a pen in my hand,
[01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:33.700]   but I wasn't thinking about how it feels.
[01:20:33.700 --> 01:20:36.060]   But if I put all of my perception there,
[01:20:36.060 --> 01:20:38.020]   close my eyes and really think about it,
[01:20:38.020 --> 01:20:40.500]   the whole nature of the perception changes.
[01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:41.900]   The physical object hasn't changed,
[01:20:41.900 --> 01:20:43.620]   nothing else in the room has changed,
[01:20:43.620 --> 01:20:46.580]   but that driving of attentional spotlighting
[01:20:46.580 --> 01:20:51.420]   and intensity is essentially what governs our whole reality.
[01:20:51.420 --> 01:20:53.060]   I think of everything we're talking about here,
[01:20:53.060 --> 01:20:56.100]   and I can't help but think about like media,
[01:20:56.100 --> 01:20:58.220]   social media, politics, you know,
[01:20:58.220 --> 01:21:00.540]   very like third rail issues,
[01:21:00.540 --> 01:21:02.900]   things that are top, very third rail topics, right?
[01:21:02.900 --> 01:21:05.380]   And yet this is essentially what we do.
[01:21:05.380 --> 01:21:08.100]   The brain people want a shorthand way
[01:21:08.100 --> 01:21:10.100]   of navigating a very complex world
[01:21:10.100 --> 01:21:12.500]   and media marketing, et cetera,
[01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:15.540]   is in large part designed to capture people's attention,
[01:21:15.540 --> 01:21:17.500]   and then funnel it towards some specific endpoint.
[01:21:17.500 --> 01:21:19.700]   You vote this way, buy this way,
[01:21:19.700 --> 01:21:22.140]   don't vote that way, or don't vote that way.
[01:21:22.140 --> 01:21:27.140]   And it's, I feel like given our discussion,
[01:21:27.140 --> 01:21:29.660]   you know, one has to wonder to what extent
[01:21:29.660 --> 01:21:31.220]   we are all living in that,
[01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:32.620]   what I guess people call it a simulation.
[01:21:32.620 --> 01:21:33.460]   It's not a simulation.
[01:21:33.460 --> 01:21:38.460]   It's a, we are all being biased by these external forces.
[01:21:38.460 --> 01:21:41.260]   Do you see examples of quote unquote,
[01:21:41.260 --> 01:21:44.660]   magic and mentalist work at the level of media,
[01:21:44.660 --> 01:21:48.060]   at the level of politics without talking about sides
[01:21:48.060 --> 01:21:48.900]   or centers, you know?
[01:21:48.900 --> 01:21:50.660]   - Of course, of course.
[01:21:50.660 --> 01:21:53.380]   First of all, I feel like social media has changed
[01:21:53.380 --> 01:21:56.020]   the way audience behaves in the theater.
[01:21:56.020 --> 01:21:57.140]   - Tell me more about that.
[01:21:57.140 --> 01:22:00.220]   - So first of all, now you have TikTok and Instagram
[01:22:00.220 --> 01:22:04.820]   and it's really short clips of information
[01:22:04.820 --> 01:22:08.540]   and people go through them really quickly.
[01:22:08.540 --> 01:22:10.940]   So their stimulation, they need to be stimulated
[01:22:10.940 --> 01:22:14.580]   way more often than they used to.
[01:22:14.580 --> 01:22:17.420]   So I can't do a routine now that really drags
[01:22:17.420 --> 01:22:22.420]   with long monologues and it's slow, the speed changed.
[01:22:22.420 --> 01:22:27.500]   And the fact that, you know, and I think about this a lot,
[01:22:27.500 --> 01:22:31.860]   I mean, there's a blackout when I did inner circle,
[01:22:31.860 --> 01:22:34.020]   there's a blackout before I appear.
[01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:36.740]   So I come in and I can still see people
[01:22:36.740 --> 01:22:38.780]   to the very last minute on their phones.
[01:22:38.780 --> 01:22:43.780]   And I'm like, wow, it's going from one stimulation
[01:22:44.220 --> 01:22:47.620]   to a real stimulation with almost no gap.
[01:22:47.620 --> 01:22:49.820]   There's not even a second, a buffer
[01:22:49.820 --> 01:22:52.700]   between this stimulation to what I'm,
[01:22:52.700 --> 01:22:57.380]   and it always bothers me 'cause I want to clean their palate.
[01:22:57.380 --> 01:22:58.780]   I want to reset their palate
[01:22:58.780 --> 01:23:01.740]   and it bothers me that they're on the phone.
[01:23:01.740 --> 01:23:04.220]   - Yeah, it's like going from the Super Bowl
[01:23:04.220 --> 01:23:05.500]   to the NBA championships
[01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:07.180]   or from the ballet to a rock concert.
[01:23:07.180 --> 01:23:11.500]   It's like, yeah, I actually have a theory,
[01:23:11.500 --> 01:23:13.980]   which is that for those that are willing
[01:23:13.980 --> 01:23:18.620]   to introduce gaps in stimulation, sleep,
[01:23:18.620 --> 01:23:21.380]   we'll talk more about sleep, rest,
[01:23:21.380 --> 01:23:23.420]   walks where we're not looking at our phones
[01:23:23.420 --> 01:23:26.360]   or just kind of not necessarily bored,
[01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:30.900]   but that those gaps we know with certainty
[01:23:30.900 --> 01:23:33.660]   are when the brain both processes information,
[01:23:33.660 --> 01:23:36.980]   stabilizes information that we've learned
[01:23:36.980 --> 01:23:39.420]   and comes up with new ideas.
[01:23:39.420 --> 01:23:42.060]   It's almost like nowadays,
[01:23:42.060 --> 01:23:45.020]   if you want to get really good at some craft,
[01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:49.100]   just introduce more gaps in between intense focus
[01:23:49.100 --> 01:23:51.940]   and learning around that thing and exposure to that thing.
[01:23:51.940 --> 01:23:54.540]   I couldn't be more certain about this.
[01:23:54.540 --> 01:23:55.540]   - It's true.
[01:23:55.540 --> 01:24:00.540]   And again, Juan Tamariz talks about the power of pauses.
[01:24:00.540 --> 01:24:07.540]   And one of the things that we try to do
[01:24:07.540 --> 01:24:12.060]   is that people will embed a memory.
[01:24:12.060 --> 01:24:17.060]   So it's not just that you encode the information
[01:24:17.060 --> 01:24:18.780]   and you want them to store it.
[01:24:18.780 --> 01:24:21.180]   You also want to store it long-term
[01:24:21.180 --> 01:24:23.460]   and to be able to recall what they've seen.
[01:24:23.460 --> 01:24:27.500]   Now, if you move from one action to the other,
[01:24:27.500 --> 01:24:29.980]   it's just not going to work.
[01:24:29.980 --> 01:24:31.660]   So there's a thing that Juan does
[01:24:31.660 --> 01:24:33.700]   where he's like he's holding a card
[01:24:33.740 --> 01:24:37.620]   and he says, "Can you see the reflection in my glasses?"
[01:24:37.620 --> 01:24:39.660]   And everyone's like, "What is he doing?
[01:24:39.660 --> 01:24:41.260]   "Look, do you see reflection?"
[01:24:41.260 --> 01:24:43.220]   And meanwhile, he's holding a playing card
[01:24:43.220 --> 01:24:45.260]   to point towards the glasses.
[01:24:45.260 --> 01:24:47.740]   And then at some point, he places the card on the table
[01:24:47.740 --> 01:24:52.420]   and accidentally he knocks a glass filled with water
[01:24:52.420 --> 01:24:54.460]   everywhere and people panic.
[01:24:54.460 --> 01:24:59.460]   They start cleaning it and it's a huge interruption
[01:24:59.460 --> 01:25:01.300]   to what just happened.
[01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:04.300]   And then he says, "Does anybody know what card this is?"
[01:25:04.300 --> 01:25:08.260]   And most of the times, nobody knows.
[01:25:08.260 --> 01:25:10.140]   He goes, "You never saw this card?"
[01:25:10.140 --> 01:25:12.460]   And they go, "No, you never showed it to us."
[01:25:12.460 --> 01:25:14.580]   "Oh, I never showed it to you."
[01:25:14.580 --> 01:25:16.260]   And there was one event where he did
[01:25:16.260 --> 01:25:18.540]   where he replayed the video to them.
[01:25:18.540 --> 01:25:21.460]   He says, "Look, I'm holding it for 15 seconds
[01:25:21.460 --> 01:25:25.020]   "in front of you in a very awkward way."
[01:25:25.020 --> 01:25:26.420]   And they don't remember it.
[01:25:26.420 --> 01:25:28.140]   - Because something dramatic happened
[01:25:28.140 --> 01:25:29.180]   immediately afterwards.
[01:25:29.180 --> 01:25:32.180]   There's no moment for them to isolate the two events.
[01:25:32.180 --> 01:25:36.420]   And the other event was way more impactful
[01:25:36.420 --> 01:25:38.260]   and therefore more memorable
[01:25:38.260 --> 01:25:41.100]   that it erased the small memory, the small event.
[01:25:41.100 --> 01:25:45.060]   There's a big event and a smaller event and that took over.
[01:25:45.060 --> 01:25:48.060]   That's why maybe, I don't know, people crashing to,
[01:25:48.060 --> 01:25:49.740]   they have an accident, you know, whatever.
[01:25:49.740 --> 01:25:52.780]   They don't remember the 10 or five seconds before.
[01:25:52.780 --> 01:25:54.060]   It kind of erases it.
[01:25:54.060 --> 01:25:58.060]   So we often, when we do magic,
[01:25:58.060 --> 01:26:01.460]   we do want to give them a moment to really relax
[01:26:01.460 --> 01:26:04.380]   and to digest what they've just seen
[01:26:04.380 --> 01:26:07.580]   so they can store it very well.
[01:26:07.580 --> 01:26:08.980]   - If it's something you want them to store,
[01:26:08.980 --> 01:26:11.700]   but if it's something you want them to forget,
[01:26:11.700 --> 01:26:14.140]   then creating a dramatic moment adjacent to it
[01:26:14.140 --> 01:26:15.980]   and with no gaps is the way to go.
[01:26:15.980 --> 01:26:18.300]   - Yes, we clutter it.
[01:26:18.300 --> 01:26:21.420]   We clutter their mind with information
[01:26:21.420 --> 01:26:23.460]   when we don't want to store it.
[01:26:23.460 --> 01:26:25.060]   We will slow down and feature it
[01:26:25.060 --> 01:26:28.180]   and give it enough time to breathe and live
[01:26:28.180 --> 01:26:30.140]   when we want them to record it.
[01:26:30.140 --> 01:26:33.820]   So the speed, the emphasis, the pauses,
[01:26:33.820 --> 01:26:35.260]   all of those things are manipulating
[01:26:35.260 --> 01:26:37.420]   how they remember things.
[01:26:37.420 --> 01:26:40.100]   - Can I share with you a little bit of neuroscience
[01:26:40.100 --> 01:26:40.940]   tidbit knowledge? - Please.
[01:26:40.940 --> 01:26:43.620]   - This is relevant both to what you just said
[01:26:43.620 --> 01:26:45.580]   and to learning of any kind.
[01:26:45.580 --> 01:26:48.540]   There's a phenomenon called gap effects,
[01:26:48.540 --> 01:26:51.340]   which are very well demonstrated in neuroscience
[01:26:51.340 --> 01:26:52.800]   and psychology of learning.
[01:26:54.060 --> 01:26:56.820]   But before I explain those,
[01:26:56.820 --> 01:26:59.660]   it's really important to know that when we learn,
[01:26:59.660 --> 01:27:01.400]   we are exposed to something
[01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:04.020]   and then the actual rewiring of connections in the brain
[01:27:04.020 --> 01:27:06.020]   occurs typically during sleep
[01:27:06.020 --> 01:27:07.840]   or rest periods away from the learning.
[01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:09.960]   There's the stimulus, just like exercise,
[01:27:09.960 --> 01:27:14.960]   you don't get better VO2 max and muscle strength, et cetera.
[01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:16.940]   During the exercise,
[01:27:16.940 --> 01:27:18.700]   there's an adaptation that occurs later.
[01:27:18.700 --> 01:27:21.740]   And with learning of cognitive material
[01:27:21.740 --> 01:27:24.100]   or information of any kind,
[01:27:24.100 --> 01:27:27.700]   even if it's very emotionally impactful experience
[01:27:27.700 --> 01:27:31.100]   or information, the rewiring of connections occurs later,
[01:27:31.100 --> 01:27:33.180]   typically in sleep or sometime later.
[01:27:33.180 --> 01:27:37.340]   Now, during sleep, the replay of the memory occurs,
[01:27:37.340 --> 01:27:39.760]   but at a rate about 20 or 30 times faster.
[01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:42.140]   And for some reason, nobody knows why, in reverse.
[01:27:42.140 --> 01:27:44.780]   Okay, so a string of numbers, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
[01:27:44.780 --> 01:27:49.780]   in sleep is played 30 times faster and 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
[01:27:50.580 --> 01:27:51.420]   Nobody's knows why,
[01:27:51.420 --> 01:27:53.420]   this is the way the brain encodes information about space,
[01:27:53.420 --> 01:27:56.140]   about information of any kind.
[01:27:56.140 --> 01:28:01.140]   Now, gap effects are the very well-demonstrated effect of,
[01:28:01.140 --> 01:28:04.400]   let's say you're teaching me how to shuffle cards
[01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:06.500]   or sequence of numbers or scales on a piano,
[01:28:06.500 --> 01:28:07.940]   I'm practicing, I'm practicing, I'm practicing,
[01:28:07.940 --> 01:28:11.820]   but somebody figured out that if every once in a while,
[01:28:11.820 --> 01:28:13.180]   there's a gap introduced
[01:28:13.180 --> 01:28:17.060]   where I cannot perform the rehearsal, I do nothing,
[01:28:17.060 --> 01:28:18.460]   the brain does the same thing.
[01:28:18.460 --> 01:28:21.900]   The hippocampus, a center in the brain required for memory
[01:28:21.900 --> 01:28:25.100]   and encoding of new memories plays that same sequence
[01:28:25.100 --> 01:28:30.100]   at 20 to 30 times faster in reverse, so this way.
[01:28:30.100 --> 01:28:35.280]   So what this means is that when we introduce gaps,
[01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:38.220]   the brain is still processing the information,
[01:28:38.220 --> 01:28:41.220]   but much faster and the introduction of the gap
[01:28:41.220 --> 01:28:45.060]   somehow allows whatever we just learned to be encoded
[01:28:45.060 --> 01:28:47.940]   far more than if we don't introduce a gap,
[01:28:47.940 --> 01:28:49.200]   which is exactly what you just said,
[01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:51.160]   but with a bunch of nerdy neuroscience speak to it.
[01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:53.620]   But this has been shown for music, for math,
[01:28:53.620 --> 01:28:55.860]   for conceptual knowledge, et cetera.
[01:28:55.860 --> 01:29:00.140]   And what it says to me is that if we want to learn things,
[01:29:00.140 --> 01:29:05.140]   controlling the cadence and the availability of gaps
[01:29:05.140 --> 01:29:07.660]   and the adjacency, like how densely cluttered
[01:29:07.660 --> 01:29:10.220]   or spaced out things are, is key.
[01:29:10.220 --> 01:29:12.820]   And I'll just share briefly,
[01:29:12.820 --> 01:29:14.060]   and forgive me 'cause I'm going long here,
[01:29:14.060 --> 01:29:18.180]   but the way I remember the video of you with Penn and Teller
[01:29:18.180 --> 01:29:20.620]   in the green and white sweater and a few other-
[01:29:20.620 --> 01:29:21.660]   - You took a nap right after.
[01:29:21.660 --> 01:29:24.340]   - No, what I do is I watch something or read something
[01:29:24.340 --> 01:29:26.340]   and I sometimes highlight and take notes,
[01:29:26.340 --> 01:29:28.140]   but then what I do is I close my eyes,
[01:29:28.140 --> 01:29:28.980]   sometimes I take a walk
[01:29:28.980 --> 01:29:31.620]   and I just think about what I just saw.
[01:29:31.620 --> 01:29:33.060]   Now I have a problem,
[01:29:33.060 --> 01:29:35.660]   and I was recently referred to as neuroatypical,
[01:29:35.660 --> 01:29:37.500]   which I'm starting to wonder if that's true,
[01:29:37.500 --> 01:29:40.940]   but I'll get assessed and we'll see,
[01:29:40.940 --> 01:29:42.900]   that oftentimes irrelevant details
[01:29:42.900 --> 01:29:44.100]   are what get encoded to memory
[01:29:44.100 --> 01:29:47.000]   as opposed to the core feature, but we'll see.
[01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:51.260]   I like to think the core components are what I remember,
[01:29:51.260 --> 01:29:54.780]   but often details that seem irrelevant get encoded.
[01:29:54.780 --> 01:29:56.180]   Like I can remember details of things
[01:29:56.180 --> 01:29:58.940]   that are kind of maybe trivial to most.
[01:29:58.940 --> 01:30:03.940]   So these gap effects are a real neurobiological phenomenon.
[01:30:03.940 --> 01:30:07.780]   There's no question about it.
[01:30:07.780 --> 01:30:09.820]   And I suppose I should pause to let that sink in.
[01:30:09.820 --> 01:30:12.660]   - I know, and people should take a nap right after this.
[01:30:12.660 --> 01:30:14.900]   Go sleep and think about this conversation.
[01:30:14.900 --> 01:30:15.780]   - I think it's so interesting
[01:30:15.780 --> 01:30:18.020]   because so that explains something
[01:30:18.020 --> 01:30:19.540]   about encoding of information,
[01:30:19.540 --> 01:30:24.260]   but causing people to forget something is equally important.
[01:30:24.260 --> 01:30:26.220]   So oftentimes when you do tricks
[01:30:26.220 --> 01:30:27.940]   or when other magicians and mentalists do tricks,
[01:30:27.940 --> 01:30:30.700]   I noticed that you'll get people to count with you.
[01:30:30.700 --> 01:30:32.380]   Okay, all right, let's just count the cards.
[01:30:32.380 --> 01:30:33.220]   Count them with me.
[01:30:33.220 --> 01:30:34.860]   It'll be one, two, three.
[01:30:34.860 --> 01:30:36.960]   Is there something about the counting itself
[01:30:36.960 --> 01:30:41.420]   or the cadence of the counting that is valuable?
[01:30:41.420 --> 01:30:45.140]   - Yes, we try to create tension.
[01:30:45.140 --> 01:30:46.100]   You know, it's a drum roll.
[01:30:46.100 --> 01:30:49.260]   Think of it as a drum roll all the way to the punchline.
[01:30:49.260 --> 01:30:53.620]   And you're trying to create this tension.
[01:30:53.620 --> 01:30:54.820]   Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
[01:30:54.820 --> 01:30:57.300]   And then it happens, right?
[01:30:57.300 --> 01:31:00.820]   And on the relaxation, the moment right after that,
[01:31:00.820 --> 01:31:04.120]   when you relax, that's the moment to do the things
[01:31:04.120 --> 01:31:06.420]   you don't want them to encode.
[01:31:06.420 --> 01:31:08.300]   Those are the most vulnerable.
[01:31:08.300 --> 01:31:10.300]   So in other words, when you go to a magic show,
[01:31:10.300 --> 01:31:13.260]   do not laugh, do not relax.
[01:31:13.260 --> 01:31:15.300]   Remain tense and you'll be good.
[01:31:15.300 --> 01:31:19.940]   But the moment you relax, you're off guard.
[01:31:19.940 --> 01:31:23.280]   You're not scrutinizing, you're relaxing.
[01:31:23.280 --> 01:31:27.780]   So we do play a lot, and Slidini was a master of that,
[01:31:27.780 --> 01:31:30.740]   the idea of tension and relaxation.
[01:31:30.740 --> 01:31:35.740]   So those are just one of the tools that we would use
[01:31:35.740 --> 01:31:39.940]   in order to do what we need to do at the right spot.
[01:31:39.940 --> 01:31:42.420]   Look, here's an interesting example.
[01:31:42.420 --> 01:31:45.340]   You've heard the term misdirection.
[01:31:45.340 --> 01:31:48.780]   I think every person in the world have heard
[01:31:48.780 --> 01:31:51.500]   and understands the idea of misdirection.
[01:31:51.500 --> 01:31:54.300]   A magician is misdirecting you.
[01:31:54.300 --> 01:31:56.780]   And yet, that information does not help you
[01:31:56.780 --> 01:31:59.180]   in the real world, right?
[01:31:59.180 --> 01:32:01.280]   You know the concept, you know it exists,
[01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:03.620]   you know a magician will make you look at the wrong place
[01:32:03.620 --> 01:32:05.460]   at the wrong time, and you would,
[01:32:05.460 --> 01:32:07.500]   or maybe the right place at the right time,
[01:32:07.500 --> 01:32:08.960]   and you would still follow.
[01:32:09.800 --> 01:32:12.920]   In other words, knowing the principle,
[01:32:12.920 --> 01:32:17.400]   knowing that he's doing it, it's still effective.
[01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:19.320]   And that is amazing.
[01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:24.160]   So to me, that is the reason I don't mind
[01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:27.400]   to enrich people's knowledge about magic
[01:32:27.400 --> 01:32:31.600]   and to give a little bit of information behind a curtain.
[01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:33.960]   The things that magicians say, oh, we're gonna,
[01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:36.840]   you know, there's a beautiful saying that I just love
[01:32:36.840 --> 01:32:39.760]   and I don't know who's responsible
[01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:41.480]   for this beautiful quote, but I love it.
[01:32:41.480 --> 01:32:42.800]   I quote it all the time.
[01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:48.680]   People think that magicians are guarding the secrets
[01:32:48.680 --> 01:32:52.320]   from the audience, but it's the other way around.
[01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:55.160]   We are guarding the audience from the secrets.
[01:32:55.160 --> 01:32:59.880]   So, because we know that once you know how it's done,
[01:32:59.880 --> 01:33:02.060]   you won't enjoy it.
[01:33:02.060 --> 01:33:06.240]   But I believe also that there's a level of knowledge
[01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:08.800]   that you can know about magic
[01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:12.300]   that next time you see a magician, you will enjoy it more.
[01:33:12.300 --> 01:33:17.300]   Because you understand that to do one card trick
[01:33:17.300 --> 01:33:20.960]   could take months and months of work.
[01:33:20.960 --> 01:33:24.880]   And we think about every word and every move
[01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:27.480]   and how we interact and how we, you know,
[01:33:27.480 --> 01:33:30.240]   hook you into wanting to be fooled,
[01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:33.640]   create the desire for you to see magic.
[01:33:33.640 --> 01:33:36.760]   And it's such an intricate process.
[01:33:36.760 --> 01:33:41.720]   So maybe, you know, revealing a little bit about magic
[01:33:41.720 --> 01:33:43.680]   is not a bad thing.
[01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:46.320]   So you understand the complexity of this art,
[01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:48.880]   which unfortunately is invisible art.
[01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:52.680]   'Cause a pianist, sure, you can see how skillful I am.
[01:33:52.680 --> 01:33:53.880]   But if you come to me after shows,
[01:33:53.880 --> 01:33:57.280]   oh, you're so fast with your hands, that's an insult.
[01:33:57.280 --> 01:33:59.800]   I want you to say, but you never touched anything.
[01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:04.420]   So it's a bit of a conflict here.
[01:34:04.420 --> 01:34:07.600]   - It's like the show that I saw that you did in New York,
[01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:09.300]   right off Washington Square Park,
[01:34:09.300 --> 01:34:13.740]   you didn't touch any of the cards or materials.
[01:34:13.740 --> 01:34:16.880]   The audience did it all for you, which are the inner circle.
[01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:19.160]   You had people actually maneuvering the cards
[01:34:19.160 --> 01:34:20.000]   and doing things.
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:21.480]   They weren't collaborating with you.
[01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:24.080]   In fact, it made it far less likely
[01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:27.040]   that you ought to be able to do what you were doing,
[01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:29.800]   which is remarkable.
[01:34:29.800 --> 01:34:34.120]   I think that, you know, as you're describing this,
[01:34:34.120 --> 01:34:39.120]   I can't help but feel that the understanding of mechanism
[01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:42.400]   or how it's done just a little bit
[01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:45.160]   is a little bit of what I've tried to do with the podcast,
[01:34:45.160 --> 01:34:46.960]   where I think people obviously want to know
[01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:48.520]   what to do for their health.
[01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:50.960]   But if they understand a little bit of the mechanism
[01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:53.880]   behind it, maybe a lot of the mechanism in some cases,
[01:34:53.880 --> 01:34:55.760]   then I think it enriches their understanding
[01:34:55.760 --> 01:34:58.260]   and gives them flexibility
[01:34:58.260 --> 01:35:01.280]   when things are perhaps not optimal.
[01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:03.680]   It's sort of like someone learning a recipe
[01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:06.960]   versus understanding why you add a little bit of baking soda
[01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:08.720]   so that when there isn't any baking soda,
[01:35:08.720 --> 01:35:09.900]   maybe there's an alternative
[01:35:09.900 --> 01:35:11.600]   or you make an adjustment someplace else, right?
[01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:13.760]   That's what a real cook can do,
[01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:15.840]   as opposed to somebody just following a recipe.
[01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:18.180]   I think that with magic,
[01:35:18.180 --> 01:35:20.240]   and this takes us back to the first question,
[01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:24.840]   I think with magic, it's so exciting to me
[01:35:24.840 --> 01:35:27.800]   that the magician, the mentalist themselves
[01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:29.560]   might not get it right.
[01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:31.280]   Like, if I know you're going to get it right,
[01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:34.000]   it's exciting because if I bring someone else along
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:35.400]   that's never seen it before,
[01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:37.240]   but what I want to know is that,
[01:35:37.240 --> 01:35:39.600]   you know, the trapeze artists could fall.
[01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:40.440]   - Exactly.
[01:35:40.440 --> 01:35:41.900]   - I don't want them to fall,
[01:35:41.900 --> 01:35:43.920]   but that the idea that they could fall
[01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:45.120]   is what makes it really exciting.
[01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:47.200]   - Absolutely, and we fake it a lot.
[01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:51.340]   There's a lot of times where I will intentionally create
[01:35:51.340 --> 01:35:54.100]   a scenario where it seems like it's not going right.
[01:35:54.100 --> 01:35:57.720]   You know, I'm in trouble and I need to get out of it
[01:35:57.720 --> 01:36:00.500]   and you go, oh, he's, okay, he's good, good,
[01:36:00.500 --> 01:36:02.920]   but this one, no.
[01:36:02.920 --> 01:36:06.680]   And then you realize, oh, it was a part of the illusion.
[01:36:06.680 --> 01:36:07.720]   - And this is like--
[01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:10.000]   - Even the trouble was an illusion.
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:11.440]   Don't trust anything.
[01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:12.640]   - Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt there.
[01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:14.280]   You paused for me to remember and I interrupted.
[01:36:14.280 --> 01:36:15.440]   - 'Cause I want you to digest it.
[01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:18.480]   - Right, this is like, this is built into every script
[01:36:18.480 --> 01:36:20.740]   of every romantic comedy and every action movie.
[01:36:20.740 --> 01:36:22.920]   Like everything's, you know, there's a challenge,
[01:36:22.920 --> 01:36:24.020]   then there's moving forward,
[01:36:24.020 --> 01:36:25.240]   and then things are about to go well,
[01:36:25.240 --> 01:36:27.740]   and then, oh my goodness, they're on the wrong trains.
[01:36:27.740 --> 01:36:28.580]   It's going to be a disaster.
[01:36:28.580 --> 01:36:30.120]   And then that's the tension build.
[01:36:30.120 --> 01:36:32.200]   And then there's resolution of some sort.
[01:36:32.200 --> 01:36:33.760]   And then sometimes there's a twist at the end
[01:36:33.760 --> 01:36:34.760]   where the resolution isn't there,
[01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:36.640]   and that's how you get a sequel, right?
[01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:39.000]   It's kind of the same thing.
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:43.320]   I wonder, and I hope that someday neuroscience
[01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:47.440]   will understand the kind of what the core algorithms
[01:36:47.440 --> 01:36:49.320]   in the brain are for a story.
[01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:53.760]   A story that involves a question and a hypothesis,
[01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:58.480]   some characters, and some trajectory,
[01:36:58.480 --> 01:37:01.560]   potential, you know, error, and then some resolution,
[01:37:01.560 --> 01:37:04.980]   and then maybe it opens up the possibility of mystery again.
[01:37:04.980 --> 01:37:08.720]   Because as you describe a magic trick or a mentalist act,
[01:37:08.720 --> 01:37:10.520]   it seems to follow that sequence.
[01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:13.760]   You introduce the people, the cards, the props, et cetera.
[01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:17.440]   And then there's a story, and here's what's interesting.
[01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:19.760]   I see this in comedy also.
[01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:21.560]   One of the things that's exciting is when we think
[01:37:21.560 --> 01:37:23.320]   we know what's going to happen next,
[01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:25.960]   and it's either that we are very surprised
[01:37:25.960 --> 01:37:28.120]   there's a violation of the expectation,
[01:37:28.120 --> 01:37:29.760]   but even more interesting sometimes
[01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:33.320]   is when we're like, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:37:33.320 --> 01:37:36.160]   Where we think that something's going to happen,
[01:37:36.160 --> 01:37:37.640]   and you're actually taking us
[01:37:37.640 --> 01:37:40.880]   towards that unbelievable possibility.
[01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:42.760]   This is something I find amazing that, you know,
[01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:45.240]   sometimes even when we expect something,
[01:37:45.240 --> 01:37:47.280]   or especially when we expect something,
[01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:50.920]   if it's an outrageous outcome, there's no way,
[01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:54.600]   that's when we are most excited.
[01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:55.640]   - 'Cause we're involved.
[01:37:55.640 --> 01:37:57.640]   We're part of the drama.
[01:37:57.640 --> 01:38:01.080]   So I love what you said about the idea of a recipe, Mike,
[01:38:01.080 --> 01:38:04.040]   following verbatim in a passive way.
[01:38:04.040 --> 01:38:05.280]   I don't know how it works,
[01:38:05.280 --> 01:38:08.000]   but eventually I think this would lead me to a cake,
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:12.960]   somehow, as opposed to understand what the chemistry is,
[01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:15.480]   and why this happens, and why this and that.
[01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:19.200]   I think that you become more invested,
[01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:21.680]   and you are part of the act.
[01:38:21.680 --> 01:38:25.080]   So it's almost like when I, I'm obsessed, you know,
[01:38:25.080 --> 01:38:30.080]   also with painting, something that I just do often.
[01:38:30.080 --> 01:38:34.920]   And I remember, I can easily recall the experience I had
[01:38:34.920 --> 01:38:38.040]   when I went to a museum and watched some art
[01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:42.920]   before I painted, and the way I view it today as a painter,
[01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:44.880]   as someone who's touched pigments,
[01:38:44.880 --> 01:38:48.360]   mixed them, put them on a canvas or paper,
[01:38:48.360 --> 01:38:51.560]   and all of a sudden, I look at it a little differently.
[01:38:51.560 --> 01:38:54.000]   And I think it changes the interaction
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:55.720]   that I have with the painting,
[01:38:55.720 --> 01:38:58.120]   because I understand the language,
[01:38:58.120 --> 01:39:01.080]   I understand the struggle, I understand the challenges,
[01:39:01.080 --> 01:39:02.840]   I understand all of that.
[01:39:02.840 --> 01:39:04.720]   And it's the same with anything.
[01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:08.200]   Like when you read, one of my favorite reads of all time,
[01:39:08.200 --> 01:39:11.400]   and to this day, it is Van Gogh's "Letters."
[01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:14.960]   I remember, you know, I saw Van Gogh before,
[01:39:14.960 --> 01:39:16.000]   I saw it after.
[01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:21.080]   And the story, and that's why I think
[01:39:21.080 --> 01:39:22.680]   we can talk about AI for a second,
[01:39:22.680 --> 01:39:27.680]   but the story of the letters with the paintings
[01:39:27.680 --> 01:39:30.560]   make them complete different images.
[01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:34.040]   When I see now the sunflowers, or the chairs,
[01:39:34.040 --> 01:39:37.960]   or the landscapes, and I have some context to go by,
[01:39:37.960 --> 01:39:42.840]   they become a part of a much bigger story.
[01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:47.840]   And to me, that enhances the experience.
[01:39:47.840 --> 01:39:52.640]   So a few friends, you know, me and a couple of my friends
[01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:54.920]   went to a museum at the Met,
[01:39:54.920 --> 01:39:58.160]   and there was a beautiful wooden sphere,
[01:39:58.160 --> 01:40:02.920]   half opened like that, and the detail was like,
[01:40:02.920 --> 01:40:05.800]   you need a microscope to see and to appreciate
[01:40:05.800 --> 01:40:08.480]   the delicate carving of the wood.
[01:40:08.480 --> 01:40:11.120]   And we all looked at it in awe.
[01:40:12.200 --> 01:40:14.280]   It was like, it's amazing.
[01:40:14.280 --> 01:40:16.680]   And I said to them, you know, you look at it
[01:40:16.680 --> 01:40:19.760]   and you see the year, it's from the 1800s,
[01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:23.920]   and you go, wow, technology there in the 1800s to do that,
[01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:26.680]   and the patience, and the time,
[01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:29.680]   all of it is part of the artwork.
[01:40:29.680 --> 01:40:31.760]   What if I told you, yeah, we fooled you,
[01:40:31.760 --> 01:40:34.000]   this was 3D printed 20 minutes ago,
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000]   it took about five minutes,
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.400]   and we can make a million of them right now.
[01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:42.960]   It's the exact same object, it looks as impressive,
[01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:45.960]   but the story is different.
[01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:50.120]   And I think that is, again, part of the experience we have.
[01:40:50.120 --> 01:40:51.840]   A recipe, when you understand it,
[01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:53.720]   the experience you have is different.
[01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:55.920]   So I do believe that knowledge
[01:40:55.920 --> 01:41:03.120]   really can enhance an experience, change it completely.
[01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:06.080]   So that's something I'm big on.
[01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:10.640]   - Stories seem to be the kind of bento box
[01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:14.000]   that arranges information best, in my opinion.
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.280]   For those that don't know, bento box, right?
[01:41:16.280 --> 01:41:18.640]   Like a box with a little different compartments
[01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:22.280]   and you have different things, and the brain can,
[01:41:22.280 --> 01:41:25.040]   okay, let's just acknowledge some first principles,
[01:41:25.040 --> 01:41:25.920]   ground truths.
[01:41:25.920 --> 01:41:29.520]   We can only perceive a certain number of things
[01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:31.880]   at any one time, but we're sensing tons of information,
[01:41:31.880 --> 01:41:35.080]   so the brain is a selective filter and a prediction machine.
[01:41:35.080 --> 01:41:36.920]   And so, and it does a bunch of other things
[01:41:36.920 --> 01:41:39.480]   to keep us alive, but that's basically it.
[01:41:39.480 --> 01:41:41.840]   All my neuroscience colleagues are probably like,
[01:41:41.840 --> 01:41:43.080]   wait, wait, wait, but what about this?
[01:41:43.080 --> 01:41:44.680]   Okay, but that's pretty much it.
[01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:47.280]   Keep us alive, predict things,
[01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:49.800]   and perceive certain things that we can sense,
[01:41:49.800 --> 01:41:52.280]   not others, things outside our sensory apparatus,
[01:41:52.280 --> 01:41:56.760]   like infrared vision and sensing certain forms of heat
[01:41:56.760 --> 01:41:58.120]   and electromagnetic energy.
[01:41:58.120 --> 01:42:00.760]   Some yes, some no, depends on what animal you are.
[01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:05.760]   So, okay, so stories and the sequencing of things
[01:42:05.760 --> 01:42:10.480]   seems to be one way in which we best learn information.
[01:42:10.480 --> 01:42:13.000]   From the time we are very little, we are read stories
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.720]   and our lives play out like stories.
[01:42:15.720 --> 01:42:20.040]   So I think that the idea that additional information
[01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:22.760]   about context, this is from the 1800s,
[01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:25.060]   not just the box that it's encapsulated in,
[01:42:25.060 --> 01:42:27.360]   but it gives you a sense this is important.
[01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:30.720]   It's old, it tells you this was harder to do back then,
[01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:32.280]   hard, presumably.
[01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:34.940]   And as you said, it brings to mind all these ideas
[01:42:34.940 --> 01:42:38.160]   about what went into that, like the pyramids.
[01:42:38.160 --> 01:42:39.760]   They're very, very interesting,
[01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:41.760]   but especially interesting given when they were built.
[01:42:41.760 --> 01:42:42.600]   - Exactly. - Right?
[01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:46.140]   And what that meant for certain people and not for others.
[01:42:46.140 --> 01:42:48.720]   So I think that, so there's that,
[01:42:48.720 --> 01:42:51.840]   which I think is so key because it extends way past magic,
[01:42:51.840 --> 01:42:55.040]   is really about how the brain works and learns information
[01:42:55.040 --> 01:42:57.640]   and perceives the world in moments
[01:42:57.640 --> 01:42:59.880]   and what we remember, what we don't remember.
[01:43:00.740 --> 01:43:02.840]   And then there's another thing that I'd like to touch into,
[01:43:02.840 --> 01:43:05.120]   and maybe we touch into this first,
[01:43:05.120 --> 01:43:06.960]   which is that you mentioned that you paint.
[01:43:06.960 --> 01:43:07.780]   - Yes.
[01:43:07.780 --> 01:43:11.680]   - So I've come to learn that many people
[01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:16.680]   who are virtuosos in their craft, as you are,
[01:43:16.680 --> 01:43:21.300]   have hobbies or practices or things that they do
[01:43:21.300 --> 01:43:24.120]   that are sort of adjacent to craft.
[01:43:24.120 --> 01:43:25.800]   I think Joni Mitchell, the singer,
[01:43:25.800 --> 01:43:29.200]   often talked about painting as a way to get into a mindset
[01:43:29.200 --> 01:43:33.200]   of singing, even though that wasn't the specific intention.
[01:43:33.200 --> 01:43:34.680]   It just kind of led there a little bit
[01:43:34.680 --> 01:43:37.320]   like a sprinter might have, I don't know,
[01:43:37.320 --> 01:43:38.760]   some dynamic stretching that they do
[01:43:38.760 --> 01:43:41.160]   that's sort of like semi-related, but not the main thing.
[01:43:41.160 --> 01:43:42.920]   Or maybe they would listen to music
[01:43:42.920 --> 01:43:44.160]   and kind of bounce around to the music.
[01:43:44.160 --> 01:43:45.140]   Maybe that's a better example.
[01:43:45.140 --> 01:43:47.440]   So it's not directly in line with the practice,
[01:43:47.440 --> 01:43:49.800]   but it puts the brain circuits that are required
[01:43:49.800 --> 01:43:52.440]   for that practice into a certain mode.
[01:43:52.440 --> 01:43:53.440]   For you, maybe it's painting.
[01:43:53.440 --> 01:43:54.580]   For me, it's drawing.
[01:43:54.580 --> 01:43:58.660]   How often do you paint?
[01:43:58.660 --> 01:43:59.500]   What do you paint?
[01:43:59.500 --> 01:44:00.460]   And do you paint with the intention
[01:44:00.460 --> 01:44:02.380]   of anyone ever seeing your paintings?
[01:44:02.380 --> 01:44:06.680]   Yes, I'm not sure, but I post them in my show.
[01:44:06.680 --> 01:44:08.960]   It was an opportunity for me to make a portrait
[01:44:08.960 --> 01:44:10.280]   of all of my heroes.
[01:44:10.280 --> 01:44:14.140]   So it was a mini exhibition as people walked into the theater
[01:44:14.140 --> 01:44:16.160]   to see all those portraits of the people
[01:44:16.160 --> 01:44:19.880]   that affected me, influenced me and so forth.
[01:44:19.880 --> 01:44:21.080]   Magicians, too?
[01:44:21.080 --> 01:44:24.280]   Mainly, I would say most of them.
[01:44:24.280 --> 01:44:26.400]   Avner was there, too.
[01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:27.960]   He's not a magician, per se.
[01:44:27.960 --> 01:44:29.760]   He's also a magician.
[01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:31.160]   But yeah, mainly magicians.
[01:44:31.160 --> 01:44:36.080]   Houdini was, Mellini, Tommy Wonder, Chan Canasta,
[01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:41.080]   David Blaine, people that really are part of who I am today.
[01:44:41.080 --> 01:44:45.920]   So to me, that's an aspect of its own.
[01:44:45.920 --> 01:44:47.520]   Why do I paint these people?
[01:44:47.520 --> 01:44:50.720]   It's because it's an opportunity for me to meditate
[01:44:50.720 --> 01:44:55.480]   with these people that I adore and owe so much to.
[01:44:55.480 --> 01:44:57.880]   But why do I paint?
[01:44:57.880 --> 01:44:58.800]   First of all, it's intuitive.
[01:44:58.800 --> 01:45:03.000]   I didn't, it was not a cerebral decision.
[01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.960]   Oh, I think I need something to supplement my life,
[01:45:05.960 --> 01:45:08.360]   you know, and I need painting.
[01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:10.600]   I always love to work with my hands.
[01:45:10.600 --> 01:45:11.680]   I always love to draw.
[01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:12.600]   I love imagery.
[01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:13.520]   I love design.
[01:45:13.520 --> 01:45:18.620]   And I always gravitated towards wanting to paint.
[01:45:18.620 --> 01:45:22.440]   And by the way, most of the things I do, they're not like,
[01:45:22.440 --> 01:45:24.400]   I don't look at them through a scientific point of view.
[01:45:24.400 --> 01:45:25.960]   It's I do them intuitively,
[01:45:25.960 --> 01:45:29.600]   and then later I understand in a more scientific way,
[01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:33.040]   why, or I ask scientific questions,
[01:45:33.040 --> 01:45:34.880]   why am I doing those things?
[01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:36.600]   And I think for art is important.
[01:45:36.600 --> 01:45:39.400]   Start with intuition,
[01:45:39.400 --> 01:45:43.600]   start with what makes sense to you or feels right,
[01:45:43.600 --> 01:45:45.920]   and then start asking questions.
[01:45:45.920 --> 01:45:49.080]   The whys and hows and what does it mean?
[01:45:49.080 --> 01:45:52.160]   You know, painting in itself, there's lots of science.
[01:45:52.160 --> 01:45:55.520]   You know, if you mix blue with yellow,
[01:45:55.520 --> 01:45:58.440]   every time you're gonna get green, that's science.
[01:45:58.440 --> 01:46:00.360]   But when you paint,
[01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:02.500]   I think you need to forget about the science.
[01:46:02.500 --> 01:46:04.480]   It needs to live in the back of your mind,
[01:46:04.480 --> 01:46:08.000]   and you need to let your, I don't know what,
[01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:13.000]   your spirit, your mojo take over and paint with you.
[01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:18.240]   So, but I started to learn so much about magic from painting,
[01:46:18.240 --> 01:46:21.880]   and I'll tell you why.
[01:46:21.880 --> 01:46:23.360]   You need a bird eye every now and then.
[01:46:23.360 --> 01:46:25.560]   You need to detach yourself from something
[01:46:25.560 --> 01:46:28.320]   that you do so much of,
[01:46:28.320 --> 01:46:31.480]   and you build all these biases, right?
[01:46:31.480 --> 01:46:33.960]   When I approach a trick or work on a trick,
[01:46:33.960 --> 01:46:36.360]   I come with a similar approach.
[01:46:36.360 --> 01:46:39.840]   You know, it's almost, it becomes formulaic,
[01:46:39.840 --> 01:46:42.080]   and formula is poison for art.
[01:46:42.080 --> 01:46:47.640]   When you approach something with a predetermined,
[01:46:47.640 --> 01:46:51.160]   you know, preconceived notion of doing something,
[01:46:51.160 --> 01:46:53.240]   you might repeat yourself.
[01:46:53.240 --> 01:46:55.000]   So much that it's boring,
[01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.440]   and you're not allowing yourself to grow,
[01:46:57.440 --> 01:47:00.640]   and to maybe find things that you never knew existed
[01:47:00.640 --> 01:47:03.080]   in you or outside of you.
[01:47:03.080 --> 01:47:05.640]   So painting, in a weird way,
[01:47:05.640 --> 01:47:08.640]   when I read biographies of, let's say, Lucian Freud,
[01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:13.640]   which I really love, and he's talking about art.
[01:47:13.640 --> 01:47:18.200]   At some point, I feel like I'm reading a magic book.
[01:47:18.200 --> 01:47:20.840]   It's so applicable to magic.
[01:47:20.840 --> 01:47:22.280]   He's talking about intention.
[01:47:22.280 --> 01:47:24.200]   He's talking about, you know,
[01:47:24.200 --> 01:47:25.640]   I'm gonna misquote him for sure.
[01:47:25.640 --> 01:47:27.000]   He says, "Every time I approach a canvas,
[01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:28.760]   "I approach it as if it's the first painting
[01:47:28.760 --> 01:47:30.200]   "I've ever painted."
[01:47:30.200 --> 01:47:31.880]   And he says, "To take it even further,
[01:47:31.880 --> 01:47:35.160]   "a painting that was ever painted."
[01:47:35.160 --> 01:47:37.800]   Because he wants to approach it
[01:47:37.800 --> 01:47:40.440]   with the attitude of a student,
[01:47:40.440 --> 01:47:44.800]   with the naivete, with the virginity of first time.
[01:47:44.800 --> 01:47:47.160]   So you don't repeat the same shtick.
[01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:49.160]   Oh, I, you do this, as skin.
[01:47:49.160 --> 01:47:51.480]   Oh, I've done this before, I can do this again.
[01:47:51.480 --> 01:47:52.720]   You kind of want to divorce yourself
[01:47:52.720 --> 01:47:54.280]   from all these things you know,
[01:47:54.280 --> 01:47:58.680]   and start the search again from,
[01:47:58.680 --> 01:48:00.880]   as close as possible to this first time,
[01:48:00.880 --> 01:48:03.280]   'cause there's something beautiful about that.
[01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:06.320]   There's a technique that painters use.
[01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:08.760]   Andrew Wyeth did it a lot.
[01:48:08.760 --> 01:48:12.120]   He would paint the painting.
[01:48:12.120 --> 01:48:12.960]   He would look at it.
[01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:14.840]   He says, "Something is wrong about it,
[01:48:14.840 --> 01:48:16.160]   "and I don't know what."
[01:48:16.160 --> 01:48:19.600]   Something is, there's something about this painting
[01:48:19.600 --> 01:48:21.720]   that just does not work.
[01:48:21.720 --> 01:48:23.480]   Then he would take the painting
[01:48:23.480 --> 01:48:25.480]   and look at it with a mirror.
[01:48:25.480 --> 01:48:27.520]   So he looks at the reflection of the painting.
[01:48:27.520 --> 01:48:28.920]   So he flips the image,
[01:48:28.920 --> 01:48:31.200]   very much like the way we think at night.
[01:48:31.200 --> 01:48:35.040]   And when he looks at the reflection,
[01:48:35.040 --> 01:48:37.960]   he goes, "Ah, the nose is wrong."
[01:48:37.960 --> 01:48:40.560]   He couldn't see it.
[01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:41.480]   When he looked at it,
[01:48:41.480 --> 01:48:45.160]   he couldn't see that the wrong was off or distorted.
[01:48:45.160 --> 01:48:47.480]   But when he saw the reflection, he could.
[01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:51.960]   Because he was able to cancel his biases,
[01:48:51.960 --> 01:48:55.920]   he saw almost a cousin painting of the one he just made,
[01:48:55.920 --> 01:48:58.280]   which is a beautiful thing.
[01:48:58.280 --> 01:49:03.280]   But this analogy also, I think, acts for me with magic.
[01:49:03.280 --> 01:49:06.960]   It's a way for me to look at magic from a mirror,
[01:49:06.960 --> 01:49:09.480]   to look at it differently, from a different angle.
[01:49:09.480 --> 01:49:13.880]   'Cause art, I find that the arts are very much connected.
[01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:16.000]   There's so much similarities.
[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.360]   And when I lecture to magicians about magic,
[01:49:18.360 --> 01:49:22.680]   I quote art books more than I quote magic books.
[01:49:22.680 --> 01:49:26.400]   I quote Cervantes from Don Quixote about magic.
[01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:30.440]   Someone wrote a book in the 1600s,
[01:49:30.440 --> 01:49:32.960]   and he talks about what we like to call
[01:49:32.960 --> 01:49:35.360]   the two impossible theory, not the two perfect theory,
[01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:37.320]   the two impossible theory.
[01:49:37.320 --> 01:49:40.320]   And he talks about that perfection in writing
[01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:43.080]   is restraining exaggeration.
[01:49:44.200 --> 01:49:46.520]   And it's a whole paragraph about
[01:49:46.520 --> 01:49:50.440]   that art needs to be believable.
[01:49:50.440 --> 01:49:53.840]   There has to be truth in it to be enjoyed.
[01:49:53.840 --> 01:49:57.160]   So, and it's so much true for magic.
[01:49:57.160 --> 01:50:00.960]   I can't just, even when we do something that's impossible,
[01:50:00.960 --> 01:50:03.520]   I still want the ground to be plausible.
[01:50:03.520 --> 01:50:06.920]   Maybe this could happen.
[01:50:06.920 --> 01:50:08.960]   Therefore, I need to restrain exaggeration.
[01:50:08.960 --> 01:50:11.560]   I need to restrain the impossibility.
[01:50:11.560 --> 01:50:16.560]   And that, again, this is a novel from the 1600s,
[01:50:16.560 --> 01:50:19.400]   Don Quixote, my favorite book of all time,
[01:50:19.400 --> 01:50:21.600]   teaching us about magic.
[01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:25.120]   And Lucien Freud is teaching me about magic,
[01:50:25.120 --> 01:50:28.440]   and Andrew Wyeth, and Van Gogh, and all these people.
[01:50:28.440 --> 01:50:32.680]   So I think that's why I love this diversity of,
[01:50:32.680 --> 01:50:34.160]   you know, I love photography very much.
[01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:37.360]   I always have a camera with me, film photography, I love.
[01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:41.760]   And composition, the idea, no one uses that word,
[01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:44.200]   usually, adjacent to magic.
[01:50:44.200 --> 01:50:46.560]   They never talk about, oh, it's a composition.
[01:50:46.560 --> 01:50:48.360]   But if you understand a composition,
[01:50:48.360 --> 01:50:50.480]   and you apply it to magic,
[01:50:50.480 --> 01:50:52.520]   you have a whole new way of looking at
[01:50:52.520 --> 01:50:55.000]   how to create a piece of magic,
[01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.240]   just by using that word, that term,
[01:50:57.240 --> 01:50:59.040]   that painters and photographers use.
[01:50:59.040 --> 01:51:04.960]   So that's, to me, just an amazing reason,
[01:51:05.480 --> 01:51:07.040]   a good reason to paint.
[01:51:07.040 --> 01:51:09.840]   - I love that you're touching into
[01:51:09.840 --> 01:51:11.400]   some of the core modulars,
[01:51:11.400 --> 01:51:15.920]   the ground truths of art, and of magic,
[01:51:15.920 --> 01:51:17.400]   and how they overlap.
[01:51:17.400 --> 01:51:19.160]   Because what we're really talking about here
[01:51:19.160 --> 01:51:22.560]   are ways in which the brain works,
[01:51:22.560 --> 01:51:25.240]   stories, and this restraining exaggeration.
[01:51:25.240 --> 01:51:27.160]   I'll just share two things.
[01:51:27.160 --> 01:51:28.520]   I'll try and keep it brief.
[01:51:28.520 --> 01:51:32.560]   One is that, again, Rick Rubin,
[01:51:32.560 --> 01:51:37.160]   incredibly virtuoso at the level of creativity
[01:51:37.160 --> 01:51:40.000]   and bringing out people's best in terms of music,
[01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.720]   other domains too, but mostly music,
[01:51:42.720 --> 01:51:47.400]   often says that the art has to have
[01:51:47.400 --> 01:51:49.120]   some recognizable feature,
[01:51:49.120 --> 01:51:51.320]   like this is this artist
[01:51:51.320 --> 01:51:53.200]   that people have perhaps heard before,
[01:51:53.200 --> 01:51:54.280]   but then something new.
[01:51:54.280 --> 01:51:57.080]   But you can't completely depart from what was done before.
[01:51:57.080 --> 01:52:00.120]   There has to be some recognition.
[01:52:00.120 --> 01:52:02.400]   You also talked about wiping away,
[01:52:02.400 --> 01:52:04.200]   using a completely new canvas,
[01:52:04.200 --> 01:52:05.800]   this example you gave.
[01:52:05.800 --> 01:52:07.280]   When Rick came to our studio here,
[01:52:07.280 --> 01:52:09.480]   he looked around and he goes,
[01:52:09.480 --> 01:52:10.720]   "Oh, I like this place."
[01:52:10.720 --> 01:52:12.200]   He's very into physical spaces,
[01:52:12.200 --> 01:52:14.160]   and the walls here are black,
[01:52:14.160 --> 01:52:15.880]   and there's some other stuff too.
[01:52:15.880 --> 01:52:19.080]   And he said, "Well, 'cause both Rick and I
[01:52:19.080 --> 01:52:20.800]   "came up through punk rock music."
[01:52:20.800 --> 01:52:22.280]   And he's like, "Yeah, I think a smaller place,
[01:52:22.280 --> 01:52:24.040]   "black walls, like cool."
[01:52:24.040 --> 01:52:27.440]   His studio is mostly white.
[01:52:27.440 --> 01:52:28.280]   And, but then he said,
[01:52:28.280 --> 01:52:31.040]   "But I'd get rid of all the art and the plants."
[01:52:31.040 --> 01:52:31.880]   And I said, "Why?"
[01:52:31.880 --> 01:52:33.600]   He goes, "Because it's distracting."
[01:52:33.600 --> 01:52:36.520]   He doesn't have art or awards on his walls.
[01:52:36.520 --> 01:52:37.480]   It's all blank.
[01:52:37.480 --> 01:52:40.520]   So that every new project is a completely new project.
[01:52:40.520 --> 01:52:44.600]   There's no previous stimuli entering the picture.
[01:52:44.600 --> 01:52:46.240]   It's a new project.
[01:52:46.240 --> 01:52:47.680]   So you don't want pictures of awards
[01:52:47.680 --> 01:52:49.360]   that you won for that album or anything.
[01:52:49.360 --> 01:52:50.560]   I go, "What do you do with all that stuff?"
[01:52:50.560 --> 01:52:52.600]   And he's like, "Oh, you just get rid of it."
[01:52:52.600 --> 01:52:53.440]   - Me too, by the way.
[01:52:53.440 --> 01:52:54.840]   I totally understand that.
[01:52:54.840 --> 01:52:55.680]   - Very interesting.
[01:52:55.680 --> 01:52:56.720]   So clean slate.
[01:52:56.720 --> 01:53:01.480]   Then the other thing that just is so striking to me
[01:53:01.480 --> 01:53:06.480]   is this idea that there has to be something
[01:53:06.480 --> 01:53:09.800]   that is a truth, a mathematical
[01:53:09.800 --> 01:53:11.760]   or a physical truth present in art.
[01:53:11.760 --> 01:53:14.960]   One of the best ways that one can understand
[01:53:14.960 --> 01:53:17.360]   how the brain creates perceptions
[01:53:17.360 --> 01:53:21.280]   is that the brain creates abstractions
[01:53:21.280 --> 01:53:22.740]   of what's out in the outside world.
[01:53:22.740 --> 01:53:26.640]   Light, sound, touch, smell, taste come in,
[01:53:26.640 --> 01:53:29.320]   but that's all translated to electrical and chemical signals.
[01:53:29.320 --> 01:53:31.080]   And then the brain reconstructs an image.
[01:53:31.080 --> 01:53:33.680]   By the way, the lens of the eye,
[01:53:33.680 --> 01:53:35.520]   you'll find this interesting as a photographer,
[01:53:35.520 --> 01:53:38.640]   inverts and reverses the image
[01:53:38.640 --> 01:53:40.440]   so that when it lands in the brain,
[01:53:40.440 --> 01:53:43.000]   the neural retina, first stage of visual processing,
[01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000]   you're actually, I'm looking at you, you're right side up,
[01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:46.360]   but you're actually landing on my,
[01:53:46.360 --> 01:53:48.680]   the perception in my brain
[01:53:48.680 --> 01:53:50.800]   is that you're upside down and flipped.
[01:53:50.800 --> 01:53:51.640]   - I am.
[01:53:51.640 --> 01:53:53.680]   - And then, now you got me.
[01:53:53.680 --> 01:53:54.880]   You had me for a second.
[01:53:54.880 --> 01:53:56.840]   I am too.
[01:53:59.920 --> 01:54:02.360]   And then the brain reconstructs an upright image.
[01:54:02.360 --> 01:54:03.280]   It's really wild.
[01:54:03.280 --> 01:54:05.320]   So the brain is constantly abstract,
[01:54:05.320 --> 01:54:06.880]   making abstractions about what's out there.
[01:54:06.880 --> 01:54:09.920]   So if I were to say, take a photograph of you
[01:54:09.920 --> 01:54:11.160]   and show you a picture of your face,
[01:54:11.160 --> 01:54:12.820]   you'd say, yeah, that's me.
[01:54:12.820 --> 01:54:15.240]   But if I said, aha, but I'm an abstract artist.
[01:54:15.240 --> 01:54:16.640]   And to me, you look like,
[01:54:16.640 --> 01:54:19.240]   and I basically do a bunch of squiggles and a thing,
[01:54:19.240 --> 01:54:21.360]   and I show you and it doesn't look anything like your face,
[01:54:21.360 --> 01:54:22.480]   you'd say, yeah, I don't see it.
[01:54:22.480 --> 01:54:25.720]   However, if I somehow have the artistic genius,
[01:54:25.720 --> 01:54:28.480]   which I don't, to create an image of you
[01:54:28.480 --> 01:54:30.880]   where the eyes are distorted, their position,
[01:54:30.880 --> 01:54:34.320]   or maybe the shading, something is different in a way
[01:54:34.320 --> 01:54:38.160]   that lets you see, and other people see your face in a way
[01:54:38.160 --> 01:54:43.160]   that is similar enough to Ossie Wind that we recognize you,
[01:54:43.160 --> 01:54:45.680]   but different enough that it looks interesting.
[01:54:45.680 --> 01:54:48.960]   We're effectively creating the kind of abstraction
[01:54:48.960 --> 01:54:49.800]   that the brain creates,
[01:54:49.800 --> 01:54:52.120]   like some level of interest in an emotion
[01:54:52.120 --> 01:54:54.960]   or in something, right?
[01:54:54.960 --> 01:54:57.280]   A reflection in your eye, could be, who knows, right?
[01:54:57.280 --> 01:54:59.440]   And so the brain is an abstraction machine.
[01:54:59.440 --> 01:55:01.120]   It doesn't actually know what's out there.
[01:55:01.120 --> 01:55:02.920]   It's taking best guesses.
[01:55:02.920 --> 01:55:07.080]   And so I think when we see great art,
[01:55:07.080 --> 01:55:10.920]   it's able to capture enough of the real physical truth
[01:55:10.920 --> 01:55:14.440]   of that thing, but to touch into some of the ways
[01:55:14.440 --> 01:55:15.720]   in which the brain abstracts.
[01:55:15.720 --> 01:55:17.800]   I'll give one more example, Rothko's,
[01:55:17.800 --> 01:55:21.400]   which are simply, to some people who don't like them,
[01:55:21.400 --> 01:55:25.280]   I love Rothko's, are simply color on canvas.
[01:55:25.280 --> 01:55:28.360]   But Rothko, whether or not he intended it or not,
[01:55:28.360 --> 01:55:30.960]   did something absolutely spectacular with his art,
[01:55:30.960 --> 01:55:34.080]   which was he eliminated the white space and the canvas.
[01:55:34.080 --> 01:55:37.680]   And in doing so, was able to allow things to come forward
[01:55:37.680 --> 01:55:40.280]   in color space, as we call in visual neuroscience.
[01:55:40.280 --> 01:55:42.960]   Certain colors are not visible unless they are adjacent
[01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:43.880]   to other colors.
[01:55:43.880 --> 01:55:46.400]   And when you eliminate all the white space, the canvas,
[01:55:46.400 --> 01:55:48.360]   and you take away the frame,
[01:55:48.360 --> 01:55:50.960]   then colors that you haven't seen before
[01:55:50.960 --> 01:55:54.280]   and color transitions that you can't see, pop.
[01:55:55.160 --> 01:55:57.960]   And that's the brilliance of a Rothko.
[01:55:57.960 --> 01:56:00.520]   It's not that it's two colors and a square and a rectangle,
[01:56:00.520 --> 01:56:02.160]   and this is why they're worth millions and millions
[01:56:02.160 --> 01:56:05.680]   of dollars, they're so spectacular because they capture
[01:56:05.680 --> 01:56:09.240]   a physical truth about color space that's inaccessible
[01:56:09.240 --> 01:56:11.520]   in a framed painting or a painting that includes
[01:56:11.520 --> 01:56:14.040]   some visibility of the canvas.
[01:56:14.040 --> 01:56:17.240]   So Rothko shows us color space,
[01:56:17.240 --> 01:56:20.320]   the math of how the brain produces color contrast
[01:56:20.320 --> 01:56:22.000]   and hue and wavelength intensity.
[01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.960]   And color is also intimately tied to value in the brain
[01:56:24.960 --> 01:56:26.440]   in a very interesting way.
[01:56:26.440 --> 01:56:28.360]   And we're not looking at it, thinking all that,
[01:56:28.360 --> 01:56:30.600]   but we feel something that's like,
[01:56:30.600 --> 01:56:35.000]   if we appreciate Rothko's like, hmm, that's interesting.
[01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:36.320]   That captivates me.
[01:56:36.320 --> 01:56:37.160]   Does that make sense?
[01:56:37.160 --> 01:56:38.640]   - Yeah, I have a question to you.
[01:56:38.640 --> 01:56:43.400]   Do we know that Rothko did it through that lens
[01:56:43.400 --> 01:56:47.200]   of understanding the science you just described,
[01:56:47.200 --> 01:56:51.920]   or did he just intuitively felt this is a great composition,
[01:56:51.920 --> 01:56:54.680]   these are great color scheme, and I will do that?
[01:56:54.680 --> 01:56:56.300]   Like, what do we know?
[01:56:56.300 --> 01:56:59.160]   - It's most likely the latter.
[01:56:59.160 --> 01:57:01.360]   I have a colleague, Beville Conway,
[01:57:01.360 --> 01:57:02.780]   who's at the National Institutes of Health,
[01:57:02.780 --> 01:57:04.700]   who's far more versed in this stuff than I am,
[01:57:04.700 --> 01:57:05.580]   so he might correct me.
[01:57:05.580 --> 01:57:07.840]   I'd love to get him on the podcast sometime.
[01:57:07.840 --> 01:57:12.520]   But it's very likely that Rothko felt something
[01:57:12.520 --> 01:57:17.040]   upon seeing colors in a restricted kind of tunnel of vision
[01:57:17.040 --> 01:57:19.720]   and then realized that if this could be brought to scale,
[01:57:19.720 --> 01:57:21.960]   because Rothko's tend to be pretty large,
[01:57:21.960 --> 01:57:25.400]   then something special was happening.
[01:57:25.400 --> 01:57:28.960]   Sort of like Chuck Close took tiny little images of faces,
[01:57:28.960 --> 01:57:31.160]   and now he had a visual issue with faces,
[01:57:31.160 --> 01:57:33.980]   propriocegnosia, et cetera, so people can look that up,
[01:57:33.980 --> 01:57:36.360]   failure to recognize faces as faces.
[01:57:36.360 --> 01:57:38.400]   They just look like objects,
[01:57:38.400 --> 01:57:41.440]   and realized that he could create composites
[01:57:41.440 --> 01:57:42.840]   of these things as a big face,
[01:57:42.840 --> 01:57:46.560]   and it's very different experience to look at a face
[01:57:46.560 --> 01:57:49.080]   that's made up of tiny fragments of many, many faces.
[01:57:49.080 --> 01:57:50.620]   Now, here's where it gets interesting,
[01:57:50.620 --> 01:57:52.560]   because there are many, many artists
[01:57:52.560 --> 01:57:55.240]   that sit out in front of museums like the Met
[01:57:55.240 --> 01:57:58.140]   and sell paintings that are very inexpensive,
[01:57:58.140 --> 01:58:01.320]   that are very accurate renditions of things.
[01:58:01.320 --> 01:58:03.560]   Picture of Taylor Swift, picture of Bob Marley,
[01:58:03.560 --> 01:58:05.240]   not interesting.
[01:58:05.240 --> 01:58:06.440]   It's cool, they can do it,
[01:58:06.440 --> 01:58:11.440]   or the real, the kind of curbside trickery,
[01:58:11.440 --> 01:58:14.360]   take a painting, paint in front of people,
[01:58:14.360 --> 01:58:17.320]   what's he or she doing, and then flip it over,
[01:58:17.320 --> 01:58:18.920]   it's the person.
[01:58:18.920 --> 01:58:19.800]   Wah, wah.
[01:58:19.800 --> 01:58:21.120]   It's cool in the moment, 'cause you're like,
[01:58:21.120 --> 01:58:22.880]   wow, they can paint upside down,
[01:58:22.880 --> 01:58:24.680]   but actually it's not interesting at all,
[01:58:24.680 --> 01:58:26.560]   because what they've created is basically
[01:58:26.560 --> 01:58:30.640]   a decent photograph-ish image, just upside down.
[01:58:30.640 --> 01:58:33.120]   So they might as well hang upside down while they do it.
[01:58:33.120 --> 01:58:36.320]   It's not interesting, it's not great art.
[01:58:36.320 --> 01:58:38.040]   So what I think what we're converging on
[01:58:38.040 --> 01:58:41.720]   is that great art takes us through a trajectory
[01:58:41.720 --> 01:58:44.960]   that involves the, I believe now after this discussion,
[01:58:44.960 --> 01:58:49.600]   that takes us through the arc of excellent storytelling.
[01:58:49.600 --> 01:58:53.320]   It involves a surprise, recognition of truth,
[01:58:53.320 --> 01:58:55.880]   a return to mystery, all these components
[01:58:55.880 --> 01:58:58.520]   that you described for magic are present in art,
[01:58:58.520 --> 01:59:02.440]   and presumably are present in a great song or play as well.
[01:59:02.440 --> 01:59:06.160]   - You know, I love everything you said,
[01:59:06.160 --> 01:59:10.240]   and I often contemplate about why I respond
[01:59:10.240 --> 01:59:12.400]   to a certain painting, but the painting
[01:59:12.400 --> 01:59:15.480]   outside the mat of the guy, I don't.
[01:59:15.480 --> 01:59:18.040]   And I never, I was never able to come up
[01:59:18.040 --> 01:59:22.680]   with a sufficient answer, but this is as close as I got.
[01:59:22.680 --> 01:59:26.360]   And I often ask, why do I like this, but not this?
[01:59:26.360 --> 01:59:28.920]   Why do I like that, and I don't like this?
[01:59:28.920 --> 01:59:33.920]   I think that I, making a judgment
[01:59:33.920 --> 01:59:39.320]   about the motives of the painter, and do I believe him?
[01:59:40.480 --> 01:59:45.120]   Is it honest, is it a true, honest expression
[01:59:45.120 --> 01:59:48.520]   that extends out of him on a canvas?
[01:59:48.520 --> 01:59:51.640]   And a lot of times, and that's as close as I got,
[01:59:51.640 --> 01:59:54.920]   I go and I see these patterns and dripping paint
[01:59:54.920 --> 01:59:56.600]   and this splatter and this and that,
[01:59:56.600 --> 01:59:59.240]   and it's super, like lots of people, wow, this is cool,
[01:59:59.240 --> 02:00:02.200]   and I'm the snob who goes, I think it's shit.
[02:00:02.200 --> 02:00:07.160]   And the reason is, when I see it, I think,
[02:00:07.160 --> 02:00:08.840]   I think I see the motive.
[02:00:09.760 --> 02:00:12.840]   He says, I'm gonna do something cool.
[02:00:12.840 --> 02:00:15.440]   I'm gonna do something that is eye candy,
[02:00:15.440 --> 02:00:19.160]   and I'm gonna use every trick in the book to make it happen.
[02:00:19.160 --> 02:00:20.880]   As opposed to somebody like Lucien,
[02:00:20.880 --> 02:00:23.560]   who paints with his guts.
[02:00:23.560 --> 02:00:25.600]   I believe every brushstroke.
[02:00:25.600 --> 02:00:30.760]   I believe it's an honest painting that comes from here,
[02:00:30.760 --> 02:00:34.520]   and there's no motive to try to wow you
[02:00:34.520 --> 02:00:38.840]   or to tell you, look, I'm the best, I'm so great.
[02:00:38.840 --> 02:00:42.360]   So that's as close as I got to understanding
[02:00:42.360 --> 02:00:46.040]   why I respond to a Lucien Freud,
[02:00:46.040 --> 02:00:49.480]   but not to that street artist who does this sparkles
[02:00:49.480 --> 02:00:52.760]   with his, I don't know, toothpaste, I don't know.
[02:00:52.760 --> 02:00:55.680]   - I took everything I had,
[02:00:55.680 --> 02:00:58.720]   all the top-down inhibition to not go, yes, yes.
[02:00:58.720 --> 02:01:00.600]   I think that the critical distinction
[02:01:00.600 --> 02:01:05.600]   is that the street artist is doing it for the audience,
[02:01:05.600 --> 02:01:08.640]   for people, and for the sale.
[02:01:08.640 --> 02:01:09.560]   They're doing it to make a living.
[02:01:09.560 --> 02:01:10.400]   - An audience pleaser.
[02:01:10.400 --> 02:01:13.520]   - Right, whereas the other artists,
[02:01:13.520 --> 02:01:15.520]   the sort of, let's call them the greats,
[02:01:15.520 --> 02:01:16.920]   are doing it for themselves.
[02:01:16.920 --> 02:01:19.520]   It's something in them that needs to get out.
[02:01:19.520 --> 02:01:20.360]   - And it's honest.
[02:01:20.360 --> 02:01:22.160]   - Right, and I have so many examples
[02:01:22.160 --> 02:01:23.000]   that just leap to mind.
[02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.720]   I'll use one from a completely different domain.
[02:01:25.720 --> 02:01:26.680]   I grew up skateboarding.
[02:01:26.680 --> 02:01:28.400]   I was not good enough to make it a career,
[02:01:28.400 --> 02:01:30.040]   but I have great appreciation for it.
[02:01:30.040 --> 02:01:32.160]   There was a guy in the '90s, he's still around.
[02:01:32.160 --> 02:01:34.000]   Sadly, he suffered an injury.
[02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:34.980]   Had him paralyzed for a while,
[02:01:34.980 --> 02:01:38.280]   but now he's walking, cycling, and skateboarding again.
[02:01:38.280 --> 02:01:39.920]   His name is John Cardiel.
[02:01:39.920 --> 02:01:42.740]   John Cardiel is just a legend
[02:01:42.740 --> 02:01:44.600]   in the landscape of skateboarding.
[02:01:44.600 --> 02:01:47.360]   I knew him back when, still know him a bit,
[02:01:47.360 --> 02:01:51.040]   and the way he would do things was just so spectacular.
[02:01:51.040 --> 02:01:53.360]   He just, like, it was just the energy in it.
[02:01:53.360 --> 02:01:56.480]   It wasn't because it was so big and so far
[02:01:56.480 --> 02:01:57.960]   and all of that, yes,
[02:01:57.960 --> 02:01:59.520]   but there was something in the energy of it.
[02:01:59.520 --> 02:02:02.320]   And I'll never forget, there's a documentary about him.
[02:02:02.320 --> 02:02:05.480]   I'll put a link to it in the show note captions,
[02:02:05.480 --> 02:02:09.720]   where someone's describing a conversation they had with him
[02:02:09.720 --> 02:02:11.880]   where he does something spectacular,
[02:02:11.880 --> 02:02:15.560]   and then he shows out, he sort of goes up to his friend,
[02:02:15.560 --> 02:02:17.600]   and his friend said, "Yeah, at that moment,"
[02:02:17.600 --> 02:02:21.140]   John turned to him and he goes, "That one was for me."
[02:02:21.140 --> 02:02:22.960]   And I just, I think of that now.
[02:02:22.960 --> 02:02:24.760]   Like John, like Cards, as they call him,
[02:02:24.760 --> 02:02:27.400]   just it always looked like everyone was delighted,
[02:02:27.400 --> 02:02:29.680]   just thrilled by what he does, right?
[02:02:29.680 --> 02:02:31.480]   He's a true virtuoso.
[02:02:31.480 --> 02:02:33.080]   But it's the sense that, like,
[02:02:33.080 --> 02:02:35.440]   he's not doing it for your entertainment.
[02:02:35.440 --> 02:02:36.400]   He's doing it for him.
[02:02:36.400 --> 02:02:38.360]   It's the expression of something inside.
[02:02:38.360 --> 02:02:42.520]   Rick talks about great art as your own offering to God.
[02:02:42.520 --> 02:02:43.840]   This is not about your audience.
[02:02:43.840 --> 02:02:47.200]   This is you and your thing, whatever's inside you,
[02:02:47.200 --> 02:02:48.560]   and it's your offering to God.
[02:02:48.560 --> 02:02:50.080]   And I think it's such a key thing.
[02:02:50.080 --> 02:02:53.040]   It's the exact opposite of someone doing something
[02:02:53.040 --> 02:02:54.680]   to please the audience.
[02:02:54.680 --> 02:02:58.080]   And of course one delights in audiences being pleased,
[02:02:58.080 --> 02:03:00.360]   but that can't be how you approach your magic.
[02:03:00.360 --> 02:03:02.960]   It must be because it just feels so good.
[02:03:02.960 --> 02:03:07.320]   The truth is, the show I create, "Inner Circle,"
[02:03:07.320 --> 02:03:10.800]   it was created because I wanted to do that show.
[02:03:10.800 --> 02:03:14.680]   I mean, if you tell me somebody's gonna come
[02:03:14.680 --> 02:03:16.280]   and watch an hour and a half
[02:03:16.280 --> 02:03:19.180]   of somebody doing a bunch of car tricks, it sounds boring.
[02:03:19.180 --> 02:03:23.480]   But I think every art form
[02:03:23.480 --> 02:03:25.440]   is an excuse to tell something bigger.
[02:03:25.440 --> 02:03:30.440]   You know, Van Gogh recorded his sensations
[02:03:30.440 --> 02:03:32.880]   when he looked at the sunflowers
[02:03:32.880 --> 02:03:36.520]   and recorded his emotions on a canvas.
[02:03:36.520 --> 02:03:39.440]   Every brushstroke, the speed
[02:03:39.440 --> 02:03:41.280]   in which he placed every brushstroke
[02:03:41.280 --> 02:03:42.600]   and the colors he chose to put,
[02:03:42.600 --> 02:03:45.400]   every decision he made was a recording
[02:03:45.400 --> 02:03:48.440]   of his sensations, his state of being
[02:03:48.440 --> 02:03:50.520]   at that moment when he painted it.
[02:03:50.520 --> 02:03:54.880]   So who cares about sunflowers?
[02:03:54.880 --> 02:03:58.680]   We've seen a lot of bouquets of flowers and roses and this.
[02:03:58.680 --> 02:04:00.680]   Matisse has this famous quote.
[02:04:00.680 --> 02:04:03.000]   He says that the hardest thing to paint is a rose
[02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:04.920]   because one has to first forget
[02:04:04.920 --> 02:04:07.200]   about all the roses he painted before,
[02:04:07.200 --> 02:04:08.360]   were painted before.
[02:04:08.360 --> 02:04:11.600]   And that's, it's so true.
[02:04:11.600 --> 02:04:14.360]   Because to me, a still life
[02:04:14.360 --> 02:04:18.240]   is something that students do in art schools.
[02:04:18.240 --> 02:04:20.280]   Here's a bouquet of flower painted.
[02:04:20.280 --> 02:04:22.140]   So while we're looking at Van Gogh and saying,
[02:04:22.140 --> 02:04:24.860]   "Wow, the sunflowers, what a beautiful piece of,"
[02:04:24.860 --> 02:04:29.860]   it's because the sunflowers are just an excuse
[02:04:30.320 --> 02:04:33.160]   for him to record something of him.
[02:04:33.160 --> 02:04:36.800]   He recorded him, himself on the canvas.
[02:04:36.800 --> 02:04:37.640]   And that's what we're seeing.
[02:04:37.640 --> 02:04:41.440]   We're seeing the personality, the excitement,
[02:04:41.440 --> 02:04:44.400]   the obsessiveness that he had.
[02:04:44.400 --> 02:04:45.840]   And I think that's wonderful.
[02:04:45.840 --> 02:04:48.280]   To me, I mean, I always start with,
[02:04:48.280 --> 02:04:51.240]   "I wanna do this show 'cause I think it's beautiful
[02:04:51.240 --> 02:04:53.240]   'cause I think it has something to say."
[02:04:53.240 --> 02:04:55.660]   I hope people like it.
[02:04:55.660 --> 02:04:57.720]   I love people too.
[02:04:57.720 --> 02:05:01.680]   And to me, the people are also part of the brushstrokes.
[02:05:01.680 --> 02:05:06.480]   I make a lot of room in my show for people to flourish,
[02:05:06.480 --> 02:05:07.880]   to become a part of the show.
[02:05:07.880 --> 02:05:11.920]   That's part of the expression that I'm trying to create.
[02:05:11.920 --> 02:05:14.840]   It's not just about me, it's about them too.
[02:05:14.840 --> 02:05:16.880]   But that's an artistic choice in itself.
[02:05:16.880 --> 02:05:21.020]   - Where do you draw, I don't wanna say inspiration,
[02:05:21.020 --> 02:05:23.680]   but the components for a show?
[02:05:23.680 --> 02:05:26.160]   So I can think of, you can look historically
[02:05:26.160 --> 02:05:28.700]   and see what people have done, learn from masters,
[02:05:28.700 --> 02:05:32.600]   teachers, from your own experiences.
[02:05:32.600 --> 02:05:34.920]   Like if you, let's say you were to travel to,
[02:05:34.920 --> 02:05:37.440]   I don't know, Australia or South America,
[02:05:37.440 --> 02:05:39.560]   would you bring back components of your travels
[02:05:39.560 --> 02:05:42.160]   to the show you create?
[02:05:42.160 --> 02:05:43.960]   I don't know.
[02:05:43.960 --> 02:05:49.960]   Or what's your process for figuring out
[02:05:49.960 --> 02:05:52.440]   or sensing into what you want to do?
[02:05:52.440 --> 02:05:53.680]   And I feel like discussions like this
[02:05:53.680 --> 02:05:54.920]   are very important for people to hear
[02:05:54.920 --> 02:05:57.760]   because not everyone wants to be a magician or mentalist
[02:05:57.760 --> 02:05:59.420]   or scientist or podcaster,
[02:05:59.420 --> 02:06:00.840]   but what we're getting down to here
[02:06:00.840 --> 02:06:04.260]   are the core components of creative expression.
[02:06:04.260 --> 02:06:08.940]   So where do you draw on the,
[02:06:08.940 --> 02:06:12.000]   what do you bring?
[02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:13.220]   Is it your daily experience?
[02:06:13.220 --> 02:06:15.440]   Does it come to you in the form of a bodily sensation?
[02:06:15.440 --> 02:06:16.440]   Is it in your dreams?
[02:06:16.440 --> 02:06:18.520]   Is it in your discussions?
[02:06:18.520 --> 02:06:21.320]   Do you try and resurrect cool things from the past?
[02:06:21.320 --> 02:06:23.360]   Where does it, where do you draw from?
[02:06:23.360 --> 02:06:24.560]   - It's all of it.
[02:06:24.560 --> 02:06:25.400]   It's really all of it.
[02:06:25.400 --> 02:06:29.720]   I'm a sponge of everything around me.
[02:06:29.720 --> 02:06:33.280]   I interact with art, with books,
[02:06:33.280 --> 02:06:36.520]   with information, with friends, conversations.
[02:06:36.520 --> 02:06:40.940]   Everything is a source of inspiration.
[02:06:40.940 --> 02:06:42.640]   Everything is.
[02:06:42.640 --> 02:06:45.080]   And it goes through my filter.
[02:06:45.080 --> 02:06:48.640]   Like I'm always amazed at the fact that, you know,
[02:06:48.640 --> 02:06:51.900]   20 students can paint the exact same thing,
[02:06:51.900 --> 02:06:55.680]   the exact same, you say, please, this is a flower painted.
[02:06:55.680 --> 02:06:59.440]   And you'll have 20 completely different paintings.
[02:06:59.440 --> 02:07:03.560]   It's because everybody, I think, filters this information
[02:07:03.560 --> 02:07:07.000]   through their sensory, whatever it is.
[02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.120]   And I think that's what we,
[02:07:09.120 --> 02:07:11.360]   at least that's what I think I'm doing.
[02:07:11.360 --> 02:07:16.360]   I'm constantly consuming, not just art, everything.
[02:07:16.360 --> 02:07:20.120]   A flower, this, a conversation with a friend.
[02:07:20.120 --> 02:07:21.600]   - Social media?
[02:07:21.600 --> 02:07:22.660]   - Maybe, you know what?
[02:07:22.660 --> 02:07:24.080]   Yes, yes.
[02:07:24.080 --> 02:07:25.580]   I think everything affects me.
[02:07:25.580 --> 02:07:28.020]   Me sitting with you right now will affect me,
[02:07:28.020 --> 02:07:32.680]   will change me, will become a part of the mosaic
[02:07:32.680 --> 02:07:37.440]   of experiences I have, and it will affect me.
[02:07:37.440 --> 02:07:41.080]   Like this conversation right now is changing me.
[02:07:41.080 --> 02:07:44.140]   Maybe I'm poetic about it, but I really think that way.
[02:07:44.140 --> 02:07:48.260]   I think that, you know, if I had any success,
[02:07:48.260 --> 02:07:50.640]   I owe it to all of the people that surround me,
[02:07:50.640 --> 02:07:52.160]   all of my friends.
[02:07:52.160 --> 02:07:55.600]   You know, terrific painter, Laura Alexander,
[02:07:55.600 --> 02:07:57.400]   who's unbelievable.
[02:07:57.400 --> 02:08:03.040]   Her contribution to me is immense.
[02:08:03.040 --> 02:08:07.280]   I mean, and maybe you can draw direct lines,
[02:08:07.280 --> 02:08:09.760]   maybe you can't, but I feel like every person
[02:08:09.760 --> 02:08:14.060]   that was part of my life is the reason,
[02:08:14.060 --> 02:08:18.760]   the outcome that I produce is because of those people.
[02:08:18.760 --> 02:08:21.480]   So I don't know if I, I don't look for,
[02:08:21.480 --> 02:08:23.740]   I don't search for inspiration.
[02:08:23.740 --> 02:08:25.640]   I think I, what I do at least,
[02:08:25.640 --> 02:08:28.900]   I really want to let things sink in.
[02:08:28.900 --> 02:08:31.380]   And I want to consume, I'm curious.
[02:08:31.380 --> 02:08:35.480]   I always want to know more, to listen to more, to see more.
[02:08:35.480 --> 02:08:38.080]   Like for example, if I go to a museum and I see a painting,
[02:08:38.080 --> 02:08:40.640]   I like to dwell on why do I like it?
[02:08:40.640 --> 02:08:42.840]   Why am I responding to this?
[02:08:42.840 --> 02:08:44.760]   Why is this triggering me?
[02:08:44.760 --> 02:08:47.040]   What is this revealing about me?
[02:08:47.040 --> 02:08:50.800]   And I don't think there's one way that I say,
[02:08:50.800 --> 02:08:52.400]   oh, this is the process.
[02:08:52.400 --> 02:08:55.080]   This happens, I do this, then a trick is born.
[02:08:55.080 --> 02:08:58.640]   Sometimes, sometimes it's the Tommy Wonder story, right?
[02:08:58.640 --> 02:09:01.400]   I see someone who's doing a trick
[02:09:01.400 --> 02:09:04.100]   and the explanation to the trick is way prettier.
[02:09:04.100 --> 02:09:07.280]   And I go, wow, it's amazing that the things
[02:09:07.280 --> 02:09:08.680]   behind the curtain are more interesting
[02:09:08.680 --> 02:09:10.640]   than the things in front of the curtain.
[02:09:10.640 --> 02:09:12.140]   That to me, it planted a seed.
[02:09:12.140 --> 02:09:14.840]   And five years later, there was a piece.
[02:09:14.840 --> 02:09:19.840]   So yeah, I think inspiration is become a sponge,
[02:09:19.840 --> 02:09:23.120]   let it, you know, you need to consume.
[02:09:23.120 --> 02:09:25.740]   This I learned from my friend, Jamie in Switzerland says,
[02:09:25.740 --> 02:09:28.800]   to do good art, you have to consume art,
[02:09:28.800 --> 02:09:30.840]   create art, get critiqued.
[02:09:30.840 --> 02:09:31.840]   Just do those three things,
[02:09:31.840 --> 02:09:35.880]   consume art, create art, and get critiqued.
[02:09:35.880 --> 02:09:42.680]   Also, when you consume art, it reveals something about you.
[02:09:43.620 --> 02:09:46.680]   So at first, when I started painting, I loved everything.
[02:09:46.680 --> 02:09:50.440]   Surrealism, pointillism, give me hyperrealism,
[02:09:50.440 --> 02:09:52.760]   and slowly it narrowed down.
[02:09:52.760 --> 02:09:55.800]   Because through observing art,
[02:09:55.800 --> 02:09:58.740]   I started to learn about what triggers me.
[02:09:58.740 --> 02:10:04.660]   The art revealed, taught me what am I responding to,
[02:10:04.660 --> 02:10:06.760]   what pushes those buttons, right?
[02:10:06.760 --> 02:10:10.700]   And I think that's a valuable, important step
[02:10:10.700 --> 02:10:12.460]   in becoming an artist.
[02:10:12.460 --> 02:10:17.240]   Consume art and let it teach you something about you.
[02:10:17.240 --> 02:10:21.360]   Then create art and then critique it by yourself
[02:10:21.360 --> 02:10:23.600]   and maybe people you trust.
[02:10:23.600 --> 02:10:25.400]   I think, again, you do those three things,
[02:10:25.400 --> 02:10:27.240]   you're pretty good.
[02:10:27.240 --> 02:10:29.820]   - I was trying to understand that in your magic
[02:10:29.820 --> 02:10:32.600]   and mentalist work, you're a storyteller.
[02:10:32.600 --> 02:10:35.080]   And to some extent, to some extent,
[02:10:35.080 --> 02:10:37.440]   and the characters can involve cards
[02:10:37.440 --> 02:10:39.120]   or numbers or information.
[02:10:39.120 --> 02:10:40.920]   And you cast people in the audience
[02:10:40.920 --> 02:10:42.880]   often into those stories.
[02:10:42.880 --> 02:10:44.100]   And depending on what they give you,
[02:10:44.100 --> 02:10:45.720]   you might assign them a different role.
[02:10:45.720 --> 02:10:46.560]   - Of course.
[02:10:46.560 --> 02:10:50.580]   - And you do know what the conclusion of the story could be,
[02:10:50.580 --> 02:10:51.420]   and maybe ought to be.
[02:10:51.420 --> 02:10:54.420]   Sometimes there's some element of surprise even for you,
[02:10:54.420 --> 02:10:59.420]   but that you're working with a certain palette of paints
[02:10:59.420 --> 02:11:01.520]   and they're predictable enough
[02:11:01.520 --> 02:11:03.480]   that you can get where you want to go.
[02:11:03.480 --> 02:11:05.580]   But as you said before, that the improvisation of it
[02:11:05.580 --> 02:11:08.000]   is part of the delight for you.
[02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:08.840]   - Absolutely.
[02:11:08.840 --> 02:11:11.080]   - Because people are resonating with your emotions,
[02:11:11.080 --> 02:11:13.520]   there's this empathic attunement, excuse me,
[02:11:13.520 --> 02:11:17.160]   empathic attunement that you create,
[02:11:17.160 --> 02:11:21.080]   that people also feel like they're part of the experience.
[02:11:21.080 --> 02:11:23.000]   It's not, it's so very different
[02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.280]   to watch something that you do on YouTube
[02:11:25.280 --> 02:11:28.720]   versus to be in a small setting versus a larger setting.
[02:11:28.720 --> 02:11:30.560]   And all of these are spectacular
[02:11:30.560 --> 02:11:31.740]   and we'll provide links to these.
[02:11:31.740 --> 02:11:34.480]   And if you get the opportunity to see Ozzy live,
[02:11:34.480 --> 02:11:36.160]   you absolutely should do it.
[02:11:36.160 --> 02:11:40.920]   It's like, it will clearly fall
[02:11:40.920 --> 02:11:43.560]   into the far extreme of experiences,
[02:11:43.560 --> 02:11:46.700]   amazing experiences that you'll have, I guarantee it.
[02:11:46.700 --> 02:11:53.000]   I think in discussing like what art is
[02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:57.160]   and people thinking about learning,
[02:11:57.160 --> 02:12:01.240]   I think often we wonder, like, if you're a sponge,
[02:12:01.240 --> 02:12:04.280]   are you, you're taking in everything, but are you,
[02:12:04.280 --> 02:12:06.800]   do you constrain your days in a way that,
[02:12:06.800 --> 02:12:08.680]   you know, like you're not, you're hanging out at the Met,
[02:12:08.680 --> 02:12:10.660]   you're not looking at the stuff on the sidewalk
[02:12:10.660 --> 02:12:13.160]   outside the Met as much.
[02:12:13.160 --> 02:12:15.860]   So you have a taste, you have a sense of taste,
[02:12:15.860 --> 02:12:18.640]   what you like, and you're drawing from different things.
[02:12:18.640 --> 02:12:20.400]   I delight in animals of all kinds.
[02:12:20.400 --> 02:12:22.760]   And so much of what I do and so much of what I think about
[02:12:22.760 --> 02:12:24.280]   in terms of how the human animal works
[02:12:24.280 --> 02:12:27.800]   is based on some overlap with the kind of core modules
[02:12:27.800 --> 02:12:28.980]   that exist in other animals.
[02:12:28.980 --> 02:12:30.640]   And I won't take us down that path,
[02:12:30.640 --> 02:12:33.100]   but I just delight in animals.
[02:12:33.100 --> 02:12:36.480]   That's why I follow so many raccoon accounts on Instagram.
[02:12:36.480 --> 02:12:39.120]   So I'm trying to figure out like when you,
[02:12:39.120 --> 02:12:40.260]   walk us through a day.
[02:12:40.260 --> 02:12:43.480]   You are a night owl.
[02:12:43.480 --> 02:12:44.960]   We talked about this before.
[02:12:44.960 --> 02:12:47.520]   So what time do you go to sleep at night?
[02:12:47.520 --> 02:12:50.200]   - You mean morning? - Typically.
[02:12:50.200 --> 02:12:51.040]   - 4 a.m.
[02:12:51.040 --> 02:12:52.640]   - 4 a.m. is when you go to sleep.
[02:12:52.640 --> 02:12:55.760]   And it's not just because you're a performing artist
[02:12:55.760 --> 02:12:58.040]   on stage, you've always been this way.
[02:12:58.040 --> 02:12:58.880]   - Yeah. - Okay.
[02:12:58.880 --> 02:13:02.080]   - And a lot of magicians are, and my mom is the same way.
[02:13:02.080 --> 02:13:04.540]   My brother, maybe he's a little changed now,
[02:13:04.540 --> 02:13:08.820]   but he's also, if he follows his nature,
[02:13:08.820 --> 02:13:10.740]   he will fall asleep around four.
[02:13:10.740 --> 02:13:13.380]   And I wake up around noon, 2 p.m.
[02:13:13.380 --> 02:13:15.180]   - Do you wear an eye mask or curtains?
[02:13:15.180 --> 02:13:16.020]   - Yes. - Right.
[02:13:16.020 --> 02:13:16.840]   - Yes. - Okay.
[02:13:16.840 --> 02:13:18.540]   - A little bit of light and I'm screwed.
[02:13:18.540 --> 02:13:21.180]   - Okay, so then you wake up, what do you do?
[02:13:21.180 --> 02:13:22.780]   I was about to call it your morning routine,
[02:13:22.780 --> 02:13:25.100]   but your afternoon, your hour afternoon,
[02:13:25.100 --> 02:13:25.920]   your morning. - It's my morning.
[02:13:25.920 --> 02:13:26.760]   It's my morning. - Right, your morning.
[02:13:26.760 --> 02:13:29.060]   What is your typical thing?
[02:13:29.060 --> 02:13:31.100]   Do you pay attention to your dreams?
[02:13:31.100 --> 02:13:32.020]   Do you recall your dreams?
[02:13:32.020 --> 02:13:33.920]   Is there information there?
[02:13:33.920 --> 02:13:35.980]   Maybe walk us through. - I don't know.
[02:13:35.980 --> 02:13:39.920]   I do know that a lot of my resolution,
[02:13:39.920 --> 02:13:43.140]   I resolve a lot of tricks or magic in general,
[02:13:43.140 --> 02:13:44.660]   it's problem solving.
[02:13:44.660 --> 02:13:47.940]   And a lot of times I have a problem and I can't solve it.
[02:13:47.940 --> 02:13:49.560]   And as you said, it happens a lot.
[02:13:49.560 --> 02:13:53.220]   I sleep, I see everything reversed,
[02:13:53.220 --> 02:13:55.100]   and then I come up with a solution.
[02:13:55.100 --> 02:13:57.060]   In the morning, it's a clearest day to me.
[02:13:57.060 --> 02:13:59.100]   That's what needs to be done.
[02:13:59.100 --> 02:14:00.700]   - Do you write it down or you just do it?
[02:14:00.700 --> 02:14:02.100]   - I immediately, I put to practice.
[02:14:02.100 --> 02:14:04.780]   I literally just, I'll grab, if it's a deck of cards,
[02:14:04.780 --> 02:14:06.080]   I would say, okay, I need to do this.
[02:14:06.080 --> 02:14:09.860]   And I will burn it into a muscle memory.
[02:14:09.860 --> 02:14:13.220]   But definitely, nighttime is where
[02:14:13.220 --> 02:14:15.300]   most of the thinking happens.
[02:14:15.300 --> 02:14:16.260]   I sleep well.
[02:14:16.260 --> 02:14:18.000]   I think I sleep pretty well.
[02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:24.100]   I try, I mean, I try to start very relaxed.
[02:14:24.100 --> 02:14:27.260]   I want the first few hours of my day to be pretty relaxed.
[02:14:27.260 --> 02:14:29.420]   It's usually a ritual.
[02:14:29.420 --> 02:14:32.700]   I have a coffee machine where you need to grind the coffee.
[02:14:32.700 --> 02:14:34.340]   You need to do everything.
[02:14:34.340 --> 02:14:38.220]   And I love the ritual of making the first cup of coffee.
[02:14:38.220 --> 02:14:39.580]   It's the first thing I do.
[02:14:39.580 --> 02:14:45.260]   I try to avoid answering, you know,
[02:14:45.260 --> 02:14:47.540]   emails or things that are urgent or that.
[02:14:47.540 --> 02:14:51.780]   I don't want to start my day with this energy.
[02:14:51.780 --> 02:14:54.020]   - Are you on social media early in the day?
[02:14:54.020 --> 02:14:55.340]   - No, no, no.
[02:14:55.340 --> 02:14:58.540]   I consume social media to a degree,
[02:14:58.540 --> 02:14:59.900]   and I think it has a place.
[02:14:59.900 --> 02:15:02.220]   I mean, there's some beautiful things
[02:15:02.220 --> 02:15:04.700]   I found on social media that, you know,
[02:15:04.700 --> 02:15:08.180]   shows I want to see, friends that do beautiful work
[02:15:08.180 --> 02:15:10.780]   and they post it and it's wonderful paintings.
[02:15:10.780 --> 02:15:13.180]   There's lots of things.
[02:15:13.180 --> 02:15:15.180]   Social media is not a black and white thing for me
[02:15:15.180 --> 02:15:16.900]   that, oh, it's just bad.
[02:15:16.900 --> 02:15:21.300]   I think it's a platform and you can curate it
[02:15:21.300 --> 02:15:24.380]   in such a way that is beneficial, interesting,
[02:15:24.380 --> 02:15:27.940]   and could give you valuable information.
[02:15:27.940 --> 02:15:31.620]   It's the obsessiveness, it's the intensity
[02:15:31.620 --> 02:15:34.700]   that's a little, and the fact that there are no filters
[02:15:34.700 --> 02:15:36.460]   or there's an algorithm deciding for you
[02:15:36.460 --> 02:15:38.020]   what you should see.
[02:15:38.020 --> 02:15:39.560]   That's a little scary.
[02:15:39.560 --> 02:15:42.720]   But no, I start the day with those things.
[02:15:42.720 --> 02:15:47.740]   And slowly I go for a walk or, I love walking.
[02:15:47.740 --> 02:15:50.340]   My thinking, I think better when I walk.
[02:15:50.340 --> 02:15:52.100]   What's the logic behind that?
[02:15:52.100 --> 02:15:53.940]   - Yeah, well, I'm delighting this.
[02:15:53.940 --> 02:15:55.980]   First of all, the way you describe your morning routine
[02:15:55.980 --> 02:15:57.820]   is very similar to Rick Rubin's morning routine.
[02:15:57.820 --> 02:15:58.660]   - Oh, really?
[02:15:58.660 --> 02:16:01.380]   - He wants to capture some of the elements from sleep,
[02:16:01.380 --> 02:16:04.780]   ease into the day gradually, walk, get sunlight,
[02:16:04.780 --> 02:16:11.060]   and allow whatever processing occurred in sleep
[02:16:11.060 --> 02:16:13.220]   and in the liminal states around the morning
[02:16:13.220 --> 02:16:16.000]   and the clarity that comes with the early day
[02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.960]   to crystallize into ideas and not deal with email
[02:16:18.960 --> 02:16:23.180]   and kind of operational things.
[02:16:23.180 --> 02:16:24.240]   - It's just a set of mind.
[02:16:24.240 --> 02:16:26.540]   If I start now taking care of emails in this
[02:16:26.540 --> 02:16:29.180]   and I'd need to send that in the package,
[02:16:29.180 --> 02:16:31.540]   then that dictates the day for me.
[02:16:31.540 --> 02:16:32.860]   - Well, it's tactical.
[02:16:32.860 --> 02:16:35.300]   What's interesting is it's tactical, it's not creative.
[02:16:35.300 --> 02:16:37.620]   In fact, by definition, it's not creative
[02:16:37.620 --> 02:16:40.100]   because it's being defined by what other people put on there.
[02:16:40.100 --> 02:16:43.540]   There's an investor, I forget his name, great investor,
[02:16:43.540 --> 02:16:47.660]   hedge fund guy, young kid, I can't remember, so forgive me.
[02:16:47.660 --> 02:16:48.500]   But this quote is not mine.
[02:16:48.500 --> 02:16:51.700]   He said that email is basically a public post to-do list.
[02:16:51.700 --> 02:16:52.540]   So people are telling you
[02:16:52.540 --> 02:16:54.300]   where to drive your attention and behavior.
[02:16:54.300 --> 02:16:57.160]   So your process is very similar to Rick's.
[02:16:57.160 --> 02:16:58.860]   I like to write
[02:16:58.860 --> 02:17:00.700]   and I have most of my clarity in the morning as well,
[02:17:00.700 --> 02:17:03.300]   although sometimes too many tactical things
[02:17:03.300 --> 02:17:05.380]   enter my framework, I'm working on that.
[02:17:05.380 --> 02:17:09.680]   But I think that what you describe
[02:17:09.680 --> 02:17:12.220]   is the life of an artist and a creative,
[02:17:12.220 --> 02:17:16.100]   capturing the unique components
[02:17:16.100 --> 02:17:18.260]   of what was put together in your brain
[02:17:18.260 --> 02:17:19.900]   based on your unique experiences.
[02:17:19.900 --> 02:17:23.340]   And it's from you and for you
[02:17:23.340 --> 02:17:26.580]   and ultimately people benefit because they delight
[02:17:26.580 --> 02:17:29.420]   and are astonished by the end result.
[02:17:29.420 --> 02:17:32.980]   So what you describe, it sounds to me like an amazing
[02:17:32.980 --> 02:17:35.100]   and a perfect day for a creative.
[02:17:35.100 --> 02:17:38.340]   I think it's so important for people to hear it.
[02:17:38.340 --> 02:17:41.740]   What you describe is also runs counter current
[02:17:41.740 --> 02:17:44.020]   to what most people do during their days,
[02:17:44.020 --> 02:17:46.420]   which is to immediately allow the context
[02:17:46.420 --> 02:17:49.060]   and the tactics of their actions and thinking
[02:17:49.060 --> 02:17:52.900]   to be driven by some external force that is not from them.
[02:17:52.900 --> 02:17:54.740]   It's from someone else's mind.
[02:17:54.740 --> 02:17:59.060]   And it's incredibly, there's a strong gravitational pull,
[02:17:59.060 --> 02:18:00.020]   like what's in the news?
[02:18:00.020 --> 02:18:01.020]   What are people saying?
[02:18:01.020 --> 02:18:01.860]   What's in my text?
[02:18:01.860 --> 02:18:02.680]   What do people want from me?
[02:18:02.680 --> 02:18:03.820]   What do people think of me?
[02:18:03.820 --> 02:18:04.740]   Et cetera.
[02:18:04.740 --> 02:18:09.740]   But that is absolutely poisonous for creative work.
[02:18:09.740 --> 02:18:13.300]   - It's pollution.
[02:18:13.300 --> 02:18:16.120]   It really, it puts you in a panic mode.
[02:18:16.120 --> 02:18:19.500]   And by the way, we have so much stuff to do
[02:18:19.500 --> 02:18:21.260]   that we'll never catch up with anything.
[02:18:21.260 --> 02:18:23.060]   So let's make peace with that.
[02:18:23.060 --> 02:18:25.980]   You'll never catch up with what you need to do
[02:18:25.980 --> 02:18:30.140]   'cause it's exhausting.
[02:18:30.140 --> 02:18:32.620]   So I understand that the first few hours,
[02:18:32.620 --> 02:18:37.620]   I can devote to me, to feeling good, relaxed.
[02:18:37.620 --> 02:18:42.180]   And slowly I will introduce, okay,
[02:18:42.180 --> 02:18:45.180]   what do I wanna do right now?
[02:18:45.180 --> 02:18:47.860]   What's the first thing I wanna tackle, right?
[02:18:47.900 --> 02:18:50.740]   Sometimes I have an urgency.
[02:18:50.740 --> 02:18:52.660]   Like I was practicing the Rubik's Cube.
[02:18:52.660 --> 02:18:55.460]   So I had a Rubik's Cube right next on my side.
[02:18:55.460 --> 02:18:58.940]   And the first thing I wanted to do, by choice,
[02:18:58.940 --> 02:19:01.380]   is to do and start solving a Rubik's Cube
[02:19:01.380 --> 02:19:04.700]   'cause I had to get good at it for a routine of mine.
[02:19:04.700 --> 02:19:08.940]   So I tried, I would like to start the day with my,
[02:19:08.940 --> 02:19:12.660]   as you said, my own decisions, things I want to do first.
[02:19:12.660 --> 02:19:14.340]   This will make me happy.
[02:19:14.340 --> 02:19:17.380]   Now I'm going to, or I have a deck of cards next,
[02:19:17.380 --> 02:19:18.700]   right next to me.
[02:19:18.700 --> 02:19:20.820]   And there's a move I'm trying to get right.
[02:19:20.820 --> 02:19:23.420]   And the first thing I wanna do is try it in the morning.
[02:19:23.420 --> 02:19:27.660]   That's another reason I love cards so much, it's tactile.
[02:19:27.660 --> 02:19:30.860]   Even though in my new show, which we can talk about,
[02:19:30.860 --> 02:19:33.020]   I decided there will be no more cards.
[02:19:33.020 --> 02:19:37.580]   It's just, you know, it's a tribute to the human mind.
[02:19:37.580 --> 02:19:39.180]   It's called "Incredibly Human."
[02:19:39.180 --> 02:19:43.380]   And it's about the things that are possible
[02:19:43.380 --> 02:19:46.300]   and yet they're on the verge of impossible.
[02:19:46.300 --> 02:19:49.140]   So a former rendition of it was
[02:19:49.140 --> 02:19:51.060]   when I memorized the entire audience.
[02:19:51.060 --> 02:19:52.380]   I knew everybody by name.
[02:19:52.380 --> 02:19:55.300]   And it's just a skill.
[02:19:55.300 --> 02:19:57.700]   I memorized 120 people every night.
[02:19:57.700 --> 02:20:00.460]   So-
[02:20:00.460 --> 02:20:03.060]   - Do you use a mnemonic approach where you,
[02:20:03.060 --> 02:20:05.020]   you know, like Andrew sounds like,
[02:20:05.020 --> 02:20:06.580]   or reminds you of some other things,
[02:20:06.580 --> 02:20:08.580]   or are you doing a paired association?
[02:20:08.580 --> 02:20:09.420]   - Sure, sure.
[02:20:09.420 --> 02:20:11.100]   So I'll tell you a story about it.
[02:20:11.100 --> 02:20:15.980]   There's a, there was, he just died at 97,
[02:20:15.980 --> 02:20:17.460]   something like that.
[02:20:17.460 --> 02:20:20.020]   Old man, but he was sharp to his last day.
[02:20:20.020 --> 02:20:22.660]   Harry Lorraine was a memory guy.
[02:20:22.660 --> 02:20:23.900]   He performed as a magician,
[02:20:23.900 --> 02:20:28.900]   but also taught people how to remember things.
[02:20:28.900 --> 02:20:30.060]   Wrote a lot of books.
[02:20:30.060 --> 02:20:35.340]   So I, and he was known for that.
[02:20:35.340 --> 02:20:36.580]   He was on the Carson Show.
[02:20:36.580 --> 02:20:39.180]   He memorized the entire audience and it was really cool.
[02:20:39.180 --> 02:20:41.100]   It was his thing, signature piece of his.
[02:20:41.100 --> 02:20:43.380]   And I wanted to do it in my show.
[02:20:43.380 --> 02:20:45.100]   So we called him and said,
[02:20:45.100 --> 02:20:48.700]   "Can we get permission to use that piece?"
[02:20:48.700 --> 02:20:49.540]   And he says, "Sure."
[02:20:49.540 --> 02:20:51.820]   "So can we meet with you and you teach me, you know,
[02:20:51.820 --> 02:20:54.420]   those little details, the minutiae?"
[02:20:54.420 --> 02:20:56.980]   And I came with a notebook and a pen.
[02:20:56.980 --> 02:20:58.660]   I'm ready to take notes.
[02:20:58.660 --> 02:21:02.580]   How do you remember 120 people every night?
[02:21:02.580 --> 02:21:04.060]   120 people's names.
[02:21:04.060 --> 02:21:07.580]   So I'm, "Okay, so what's the work on it?"
[02:21:07.580 --> 02:21:09.740]   And he goes, "Oh, you just remember them."
[02:21:09.740 --> 02:21:11.780]   - Is that first and last names or first names?
[02:21:11.780 --> 02:21:12.740]   - First and last.
[02:21:12.740 --> 02:21:13.580]   - First and last names.
[02:21:13.580 --> 02:21:14.420]   - Yeah, you can do first.
[02:21:14.420 --> 02:21:15.500]   He did first and last, yeah.
[02:21:15.500 --> 02:21:16.340]   - Goodness gracious.
[02:21:16.340 --> 02:21:19.300]   - So he says, "You just remember them."
[02:21:19.300 --> 02:21:21.260]   "Yeah, but tell me the techniques."
[02:21:21.260 --> 02:21:25.260]   I thought it was a joke.
[02:21:25.260 --> 02:21:27.620]   I wrote nothing that day, nothing.
[02:21:27.620 --> 02:21:31.380]   And I was so scared of it.
[02:21:31.380 --> 02:21:35.060]   And I tried to remember people and I couldn't
[02:21:35.060 --> 02:21:36.700]   and it was so daunting.
[02:21:36.700 --> 02:21:38.980]   And I realized that in order to remember
[02:21:38.980 --> 02:21:40.660]   a lot of people's names,
[02:21:40.660 --> 02:21:43.060]   the first thing you need to conquer is fear.
[02:21:43.060 --> 02:21:46.380]   It's fear.
[02:21:46.380 --> 02:21:49.140]   I was afraid that I won't be able to do it.
[02:21:49.140 --> 02:21:53.700]   And one night I did a small venue
[02:21:53.700 --> 02:21:55.420]   with like 30 people showed up.
[02:21:55.420 --> 02:21:56.980]   So I said, "Okay, that's manageable."
[02:21:56.980 --> 02:21:58.660]   I can memorize 30 people.
[02:21:58.660 --> 02:22:00.620]   So I did it.
[02:22:00.620 --> 02:22:04.420]   And you don't know that you know their names
[02:22:04.420 --> 02:22:05.780]   until you do it.
[02:22:05.780 --> 02:22:07.260]   'Cause all I do is I shake their hands.
[02:22:07.260 --> 02:22:08.900]   "Oh, thank you so much, please take your seat."
[02:22:08.900 --> 02:22:10.300]   I was the usher.
[02:22:10.300 --> 02:22:11.940]   "Sit down, thank you."
[02:22:11.940 --> 02:22:14.780]   Now the show starts and this is a test for me.
[02:22:14.780 --> 02:22:16.940]   Do I remember their names?
[02:22:16.940 --> 02:22:18.380]   I don't know.
[02:22:18.380 --> 02:22:21.420]   And I go, "Susan, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
[02:22:21.420 --> 02:22:23.300]   And I was able to do all their names.
[02:22:23.300 --> 02:22:25.700]   - Do you still remember any of their names?
[02:22:25.700 --> 02:22:26.860]   - I'll tell you a story about that.
[02:22:26.860 --> 02:22:27.700]   Remind me though.
[02:22:27.700 --> 02:22:29.100]   - I will, I'll come back to that.
[02:22:29.100 --> 02:22:35.460]   - So it felt like I had superpowers.
[02:22:35.460 --> 02:22:38.340]   It was as amazing to me, I think, as it was maybe to them.
[02:22:39.740 --> 02:22:42.180]   And then I started doing it in that venue
[02:22:42.180 --> 02:22:43.420]   with about 60 people.
[02:22:43.420 --> 02:22:48.100]   So I remember, I have everybody sit down
[02:22:48.100 --> 02:22:51.220]   and there's a point in the show where I take two coins,
[02:22:51.220 --> 02:22:54.580]   large coins, and I glue them with tape on my head.
[02:22:54.580 --> 02:22:57.180]   So I'm blindfolded and I solve two Rubik's Cubes
[02:22:57.180 --> 02:22:58.780]   at the same time, blindfolded.
[02:22:58.780 --> 02:23:03.140]   And I forgot, talking about memory,
[02:23:03.140 --> 02:23:08.140]   I forgot to have somebody just have a stopwatch
[02:23:08.460 --> 02:23:11.140]   just to time me how long it takes me to do it.
[02:23:11.140 --> 02:23:12.460]   I just forgot.
[02:23:12.460 --> 02:23:15.060]   And I go, "Guys, I'm so sorry, I forgot."
[02:23:15.060 --> 02:23:18.500]   Does anybody here has a watch or an app
[02:23:18.500 --> 02:23:20.220]   that he can measure, to take time?
[02:23:20.220 --> 02:23:23.020]   And one guy goes, "Yeah, I can do it."
[02:23:23.020 --> 02:23:25.540]   And I recognize his voice.
[02:23:25.540 --> 02:23:28.700]   And I did not know I could do it.
[02:23:28.700 --> 02:23:30.980]   I go, "Robert?"
[02:23:30.980 --> 02:23:34.180]   And he goes, "Yes."
[02:23:34.180 --> 02:23:36.260]   So I did not just remember how they look.
[02:23:36.260 --> 02:23:37.620]   I remember how they sound.
[02:23:37.620 --> 02:23:40.140]   - And you didn't know that you remembered how they sound.
[02:23:40.140 --> 02:23:40.980]   It was just part of your--
[02:23:40.980 --> 02:23:43.180]   - It was a surprise to me.
[02:23:43.180 --> 02:23:46.120]   And then, to make, and it's crazy.
[02:23:46.120 --> 02:23:49.220]   You're sitting next to Susan, right?
[02:23:49.220 --> 02:23:53.740]   And Stephanie, and I describe how they look like.
[02:23:53.740 --> 02:23:54.700]   Almost to a T.
[02:23:54.700 --> 02:23:58.420]   And it amazes me how much we do remember.
[02:23:58.420 --> 02:24:01.700]   And that's crazy 'cause the voice,
[02:24:01.700 --> 02:24:04.580]   like your voice, my voice,
[02:24:04.580 --> 02:24:07.260]   people's voices are very distinct.
[02:24:07.260 --> 02:24:09.540]   And now I know it.
[02:24:09.540 --> 02:24:13.420]   That I can hear somebody peripheral, and I know.
[02:24:13.420 --> 02:24:16.700]   So that's about memory.
[02:24:16.700 --> 02:24:19.460]   How do we get to these memories?
[02:24:19.460 --> 02:24:24.340]   So, to your question,
[02:24:24.340 --> 02:24:27.500]   you asked me if use the mnemonics or stuff.
[02:24:27.500 --> 02:24:32.660]   The truth is, we need to care.
[02:24:32.660 --> 02:24:35.660]   If you care about someone's name,
[02:24:35.660 --> 02:24:38.740]   like let's assume you see somebody in a coffee shop,
[02:24:38.740 --> 02:24:43.500]   and the one thing you really want is to talk to this person
[02:24:43.500 --> 02:24:44.900]   'cause you're attracted to them.
[02:24:44.900 --> 02:24:45.940]   I don't know.
[02:24:45.940 --> 02:24:47.100]   And you say, "Hi, nice to meet you.
[02:24:47.100 --> 02:24:49.300]   "I'm Asi, what's your name?"
[02:24:49.300 --> 02:24:52.100]   The moment they say their name, you will never forget it
[02:24:52.100 --> 02:24:53.940]   because you care.
[02:24:53.940 --> 02:24:55.580]   You want.
[02:24:55.580 --> 02:24:56.740]   A lot of times we say, "Hey, what's your name?"
[02:24:56.740 --> 02:24:57.740]   We don't mean it.
[02:24:57.740 --> 02:25:00.100]   We don't care about the answer.
[02:25:00.100 --> 02:25:02.900]   And that's a big part of why we don't remember it.
[02:25:02.900 --> 02:25:04.660]   But if I say, "You need to meet this guy.
[02:25:04.660 --> 02:25:06.900]   "This guy, you should know him.
[02:25:06.900 --> 02:25:10.420]   "You will make an effort."
[02:25:10.420 --> 02:25:13.420]   So, the one thing I did the most was repeat their name.
[02:25:13.420 --> 02:25:14.260]   "What's your name?"
[02:25:14.260 --> 02:25:15.100]   "Andrew."
[02:25:15.100 --> 02:25:15.940]   "Oh, Andrew, nice to meet you."
[02:25:15.940 --> 02:25:18.500]   I repeated it a few times as I talked to them
[02:25:18.500 --> 02:25:20.180]   or we have a little conversation.
[02:25:20.180 --> 02:25:23.060]   And I also realized that the more you interact with them,
[02:25:23.060 --> 02:25:24.740]   the more you remember it.
[02:25:24.740 --> 02:25:27.020]   So, in the show, I always, I faked it.
[02:25:27.020 --> 02:25:28.780]   I struggled on the last two people.
[02:25:28.780 --> 02:25:29.940]   I said, "I don't know your names.
[02:25:29.940 --> 02:25:32.620]   "Remain standing, I'll get back to you."
[02:25:32.620 --> 02:25:34.300]   And it was Genevieve.
[02:25:34.300 --> 02:25:35.420]   I remember now the story.
[02:25:35.420 --> 02:25:38.420]   Genevieve, I said, "You know, I don't know her name yet."
[02:25:38.420 --> 02:25:39.620]   So, I said, "I don't remember your name,
[02:25:39.620 --> 02:25:42.260]   "but you told me you just came from Africa.
[02:25:42.260 --> 02:25:43.900]   "You were on vacation for two weeks."
[02:25:43.900 --> 02:25:47.620]   And I start recalling so much information about her.
[02:25:47.620 --> 02:25:50.420]   And, "Genevieve, I'll never forget your name."
[02:25:50.420 --> 02:25:51.260]   And she sits down.
[02:25:51.260 --> 02:25:52.380]   And it's amazing.
[02:25:52.380 --> 02:25:54.300]   But the more they tell you about themselves,
[02:25:54.300 --> 02:25:56.460]   the more you retain and the more you remember.
[02:25:56.460 --> 02:25:59.140]   Because, as you said, it's a story.
[02:25:59.140 --> 02:26:01.340]   And now, Genevieve is just not,
[02:26:01.340 --> 02:26:03.820]   it's not just a random person with the name Genevieve.
[02:26:03.820 --> 02:26:07.220]   It's somebody who's been to that place and this place
[02:26:07.220 --> 02:26:08.180]   and she's, you know.
[02:26:08.180 --> 02:26:10.580]   You can connect it to a story
[02:26:10.580 --> 02:26:14.940]   or to something you can visualize, right?
[02:26:14.940 --> 02:26:17.580]   Every now and then, you know, Stove is Dave.
[02:26:17.580 --> 02:26:19.700]   And, you know, I would make those mnemonics
[02:26:19.700 --> 02:26:22.300]   or try to find a feature,
[02:26:22.300 --> 02:26:24.420]   almost like the way a caricaturist does.
[02:26:24.420 --> 02:26:26.820]   You know, exaggerate a feature
[02:26:26.820 --> 02:26:28.580]   and attach it to the name somehow.
[02:26:28.580 --> 02:26:32.740]   Like, Anthony maybe has lots of ants all over him.
[02:26:32.740 --> 02:26:33.860]   You know, stuff like that.
[02:26:33.860 --> 02:26:37.340]   But the truth is, I only did it with those I struggled.
[02:26:37.340 --> 02:26:39.100]   It was a backup plan.
[02:26:39.100 --> 02:26:40.940]   But most of the people, I hear the name,
[02:26:40.940 --> 02:26:42.260]   I cared, I wanted,
[02:26:42.260 --> 02:26:44.260]   and I had confidence that I could do it.
[02:26:44.260 --> 02:26:45.100]   And I did it.
[02:26:45.100 --> 02:26:48.660]   - The brain definitely remembers information
[02:26:48.660 --> 02:26:50.460]   that has an emotional salience to it.
[02:26:50.460 --> 02:26:52.900]   So caring about something,
[02:26:52.900 --> 02:26:54.820]   some set of information, name or otherwise,
[02:26:54.820 --> 02:26:59.660]   definitely will help encode to memory.
[02:26:59.660 --> 02:27:02.860]   The other is to put things into motifs of song.
[02:27:02.860 --> 02:27:05.580]   It is no coincidence that children learn songs
[02:27:05.580 --> 02:27:07.860]   to learn the alphabet, A, B, C, D, E.
[02:27:07.860 --> 02:27:10.860]   The inflections, the motifs within that song
[02:27:10.860 --> 02:27:13.940]   of the alphabet is what allows us to remember
[02:27:13.940 --> 02:27:18.180]   that our entire lives, as opposed to A, B, C, D, E, F, G.
[02:27:18.180 --> 02:27:20.700]   Think about the number pi out past 3.14,
[02:27:20.700 --> 02:27:24.620]   out to some number of, you know,
[02:27:24.620 --> 02:27:26.500]   some people can remember it out very far.
[02:27:26.500 --> 02:27:31.260]   If you set it to a song with some repeating motifs,
[02:27:31.260 --> 02:27:35.140]   like the alphabet song or happy birthday song,
[02:27:35.140 --> 02:27:36.660]   that's how people remember very, very far
[02:27:36.660 --> 02:27:39.180]   because the brain creates these modules.
[02:27:39.180 --> 02:27:40.980]   It doesn't take bits of information
[02:27:40.980 --> 02:27:42.260]   and just throw it in there.
[02:27:42.260 --> 02:27:45.100]   It creates libraries of information
[02:27:45.100 --> 02:27:46.540]   where just as in the library,
[02:27:46.540 --> 02:27:48.660]   certain books are grouped with other books
[02:27:48.660 --> 02:27:53.180]   and more disparate topics are positioned further away
[02:27:53.180 --> 02:27:55.540]   in the library from one another.
[02:27:56.540 --> 02:27:58.900]   For those of you that are younger than me,
[02:27:58.900 --> 02:28:01.620]   you can look up what a library is, just kidding.
[02:28:01.620 --> 02:28:03.620]   But this is how the brain works, right?
[02:28:03.620 --> 02:28:05.580]   And so it's amazing that you did that.
[02:28:05.580 --> 02:28:10.580]   And it also just really highlights that when we do this,
[02:28:10.580 --> 02:28:14.620]   we are remembering far more than we think we remember.
[02:28:14.620 --> 02:28:16.980]   Some people are more visual, some people more auditory,
[02:28:16.980 --> 02:28:18.460]   but it's all coming in there
[02:28:18.460 --> 02:28:20.900]   provided that people have access to those senses.
[02:28:20.900 --> 02:28:23.140]   It's just spectacular.
[02:28:24.300 --> 02:28:25.980]   - I have to return to something
[02:28:25.980 --> 02:28:28.700]   because I took us away from it, which was you said,
[02:28:28.700 --> 02:28:29.900]   is there something about walking
[02:28:29.900 --> 02:28:32.820]   that allows for creative thought?
[02:28:32.820 --> 02:28:35.060]   I'm of the mind now based on my observation
[02:28:35.060 --> 02:28:38.900]   of extremely creative individuals and talking to them
[02:28:38.900 --> 02:28:40.340]   as well as some understanding
[02:28:40.340 --> 02:28:41.820]   of the neuroscience of creativity,
[02:28:41.820 --> 02:28:43.980]   which by the way, there isn't a lot,
[02:28:43.980 --> 02:28:46.020]   but it's sort of happening more and more,
[02:28:46.020 --> 02:28:50.280]   that there are sort of two polarized states.
[02:28:51.580 --> 02:28:54.300]   One is being very, very still with the mind active.
[02:28:54.300 --> 02:28:56.660]   This is true of rapid eye movement sleep, we're paralyzed.
[02:28:56.660 --> 02:28:57.820]   The mind is very, very active.
[02:28:57.820 --> 02:28:59.460]   It's a state in which memories are encoded,
[02:28:59.460 --> 02:29:02.300]   especially emotional memories.
[02:29:02.300 --> 02:29:04.340]   Many people, his name seems to keep coming up,
[02:29:04.340 --> 02:29:07.500]   but Rick Rubin, Karl Deisseroth, Einstein, and others
[02:29:07.500 --> 02:29:10.140]   reported having practices where they would deliberately sit
[02:29:10.140 --> 02:29:12.700]   or lie down and to be very still
[02:29:12.700 --> 02:29:14.700]   and deliberately make their mind very active,
[02:29:14.700 --> 02:29:16.300]   even thinking in complete sentences
[02:29:16.300 --> 02:29:19.900]   as a way to come up with ideas, a deliberate practice.
[02:29:19.900 --> 02:29:22.260]   The other is to be in movement,
[02:29:22.260 --> 02:29:24.140]   but to not really try and force your thinking
[02:29:24.140 --> 02:29:25.700]   down a particular trajectory.
[02:29:25.700 --> 02:29:27.900]   Some people seem to favor one or the other.
[02:29:27.900 --> 02:29:30.900]   I come up with a lot of my ideas while jogging or running
[02:29:30.900 --> 02:29:32.380]   or walking as you do.
[02:29:32.380 --> 02:29:35.140]   So there's something about either stilling the body
[02:29:35.140 --> 02:29:36.900]   or making the body just active enough
[02:29:36.900 --> 02:29:38.960]   that the mind is allowed to take off
[02:29:38.960 --> 02:29:40.740]   down novel trajectories.
[02:29:40.740 --> 02:29:43.740]   And that's very difficult, I think,
[02:29:43.740 --> 02:29:45.500]   for a lot of people to sit down with pen and paper
[02:29:45.500 --> 02:29:46.500]   and write things out.
[02:29:46.500 --> 02:29:49.780]   So anyway, your practice of walking in the morning
[02:29:49.780 --> 02:29:53.540]   is one that perhaps people should want to explore.
[02:29:53.540 --> 02:29:58.540]   I think that when people hear about having a super memory
[02:29:58.540 --> 02:30:03.140]   for names or being able to read people,
[02:30:03.140 --> 02:30:05.420]   so much of what you describe as being able to read people
[02:30:05.420 --> 02:30:07.460]   based on their physicality,
[02:30:07.460 --> 02:30:08.620]   all these questions come to mind.
[02:30:08.620 --> 02:30:10.100]   And so I can't help myself.
[02:30:10.100 --> 02:30:13.460]   Do you believe in these kind of notions,
[02:30:13.460 --> 02:30:15.260]   like if people are sitting arms crossed
[02:30:15.260 --> 02:30:17.220]   that they're more closed and difficult to get to,
[02:30:17.220 --> 02:30:19.660]   whereas people who are kind of more forward leaning
[02:30:19.660 --> 02:30:21.580]   in their posture, they're more willing to engage?
[02:30:21.580 --> 02:30:25.100]   I mean, does that stuff really hold in your laboratory
[02:30:25.100 --> 02:30:27.620]   of experiments of magic and mentalism?
[02:30:27.620 --> 02:30:31.460]   - Yeah, so body language is something that I read much about.
[02:30:31.460 --> 02:30:35.620]   I believe I'm not an expert when it comes to body language,
[02:30:35.620 --> 02:30:39.940]   but I do think that I don't even control it.
[02:30:39.940 --> 02:30:43.460]   It's just somebody can signal a closeness to them
[02:30:43.460 --> 02:30:45.580]   or an openness to them, all right?
[02:30:45.580 --> 02:30:49.360]   But I also found it to be very misleading a lot of times.
[02:30:49.360 --> 02:30:52.260]   Like if people do certain things because they're cold
[02:30:52.260 --> 02:30:53.820]   or this or they're shy,
[02:30:53.820 --> 02:30:57.220]   and being shy could be misunderstood as
[02:30:57.220 --> 02:31:01.940]   or perceived as snobbish and vice versa, right?
[02:31:01.940 --> 02:31:05.060]   So that could be really misleading.
[02:31:05.060 --> 02:31:07.320]   What I rely on is interaction.
[02:31:07.320 --> 02:31:11.860]   When I interact with people or if...
[02:31:11.860 --> 02:31:15.420]   And I'm saying it in the slightest possible way
[02:31:15.420 --> 02:31:19.060]   when I challenge them with something very simple.
[02:31:19.060 --> 02:31:20.980]   And I see how they deal with it,
[02:31:20.980 --> 02:31:24.020]   that reveals a lot about them immediately.
[02:31:24.020 --> 02:31:27.220]   'Cause look, we need to make decisions on the spot.
[02:31:27.220 --> 02:31:29.620]   Even if I just say, "Can you please open your hand?"
[02:31:29.620 --> 02:31:33.140]   And I give them something, how eager they are to do it,
[02:31:33.140 --> 02:31:35.920]   how they do it, can they follow directions?
[02:31:35.920 --> 02:31:38.740]   I want also people that will,
[02:31:38.740 --> 02:31:43.220]   you know, that are able to do the things I want them to do
[02:31:43.220 --> 02:31:45.340]   for a specific routine.
[02:31:45.340 --> 02:31:47.460]   And by the way, some routines,
[02:31:47.460 --> 02:31:49.800]   I would use this type of person.
[02:31:49.800 --> 02:31:51.140]   This one needs a teenager.
[02:31:51.140 --> 02:31:55.540]   This one, I want somebody a little older.
[02:31:55.540 --> 02:32:00.020]   Every routine, I kind of assign a different character.
[02:32:00.020 --> 02:32:02.300]   And it's, again, it's trial and error.
[02:32:02.300 --> 02:32:05.240]   I tried with a certain person for a long time,
[02:32:05.240 --> 02:32:06.580]   and I say, "Now I get it."
[02:32:06.580 --> 02:32:08.420]   It's my relationship.
[02:32:08.420 --> 02:32:11.500]   And by the way, as I'm aging, that also changes.
[02:32:11.500 --> 02:32:13.260]   Like, but there's a piece where I used to do it,
[02:32:13.260 --> 02:32:16.220]   and I always preferred an older woman to do it.
[02:32:16.220 --> 02:32:21.220]   And you could see there's some, a motherly quality to it,
[02:32:21.220 --> 02:32:24.280]   'cause that's kind of the role she was in.
[02:32:24.280 --> 02:32:27.980]   But now, as I'm aging, it's not gonna work as well.
[02:32:27.980 --> 02:32:32.540]   I think there's, you're creating relationships.
[02:32:32.540 --> 02:32:34.460]   Like, for example, I'm a guy,
[02:32:34.460 --> 02:32:37.100]   and if I work with another guy,
[02:32:37.100 --> 02:32:39.580]   that's some sort of an energy.
[02:32:39.580 --> 02:32:41.340]   If it's a female, it's different.
[02:32:41.340 --> 02:32:43.820]   If it's a young, old,
[02:32:43.820 --> 02:32:47.180]   my relationship with these people changes,
[02:32:47.180 --> 02:32:49.700]   and how they feel, do they feel comfortable with me?
[02:32:49.700 --> 02:32:52.820]   There's a certain thing I can do with a certain individual,
[02:32:52.820 --> 02:32:54.580]   but not with another.
[02:32:54.580 --> 02:32:57.020]   So that's something I constantly think about.
[02:32:57.020 --> 02:33:00.920]   I choose my spectators very, very carefully.
[02:33:00.920 --> 02:33:04.100]   - You mentioned that you take in things
[02:33:04.100 --> 02:33:07.860]   from your environment and from many diverse sources,
[02:33:07.860 --> 02:33:10.220]   origin, interactions with people, et cetera.
[02:33:11.180 --> 02:33:14.700]   You seem like a very positive person.
[02:33:14.700 --> 02:33:17.100]   I generally upbeat and enjoy your work.
[02:33:17.100 --> 02:33:20.940]   I get that impression very much so.
[02:33:20.940 --> 02:33:23.420]   But I'm assuming that you also experience
[02:33:23.420 --> 02:33:27.220]   anger, frustration, et cetera.
[02:33:27.220 --> 02:33:31.460]   Do you separate that from your creative work?
[02:33:31.460 --> 02:33:34.540]   Do you try and buffer yourself against that?
[02:33:34.540 --> 02:33:36.940]   And the reason I ask is that many of the creatives
[02:33:36.940 --> 02:33:40.520]   that I know are artists of which you are,
[02:33:40.520 --> 02:33:44.380]   they're very feeling people.
[02:33:44.380 --> 02:33:46.100]   It's required for the craft.
[02:33:46.100 --> 02:33:49.300]   You need to be permeable to some extent.
[02:33:49.300 --> 02:33:50.980]   But of course you want to be semi-permeable.
[02:33:50.980 --> 02:33:53.020]   You don't want every emotion or thing
[02:33:53.020 --> 02:33:55.380]   that you encounter to yank you all over the place.
[02:33:55.380 --> 02:33:59.140]   But magic is this thing of delight,
[02:33:59.140 --> 02:34:00.740]   and it's this thing of love,
[02:34:00.740 --> 02:34:02.480]   and that all sounds wonderful.
[02:34:02.480 --> 02:34:05.860]   But how do you deal with things that upset you
[02:34:05.860 --> 02:34:06.700]   and frustrate you?
[02:34:06.700 --> 02:34:09.420]   Do you actively try and push those out
[02:34:09.420 --> 02:34:10.500]   from the creative process,
[02:34:10.500 --> 02:34:12.060]   or do you kind of incorporate them
[02:34:12.060 --> 02:34:14.060]   into the creative process?
[02:34:14.060 --> 02:34:15.540]   - Want the truth, or what do you need?
[02:34:15.540 --> 02:34:16.540]   - I only want the truth.
[02:34:16.540 --> 02:34:17.380]   - The truth.
[02:34:17.380 --> 02:34:22.380]   The truth is I consider myself a perfectionist,
[02:34:22.380 --> 02:34:26.420]   and I demand so much of myself
[02:34:26.420 --> 02:34:28.580]   and also the people working with me.
[02:34:28.580 --> 02:34:32.580]   I could dwell on the smallest detail.
[02:34:32.580 --> 02:34:35.900]   I look at the poster and I say the font is wrong.
[02:34:35.900 --> 02:34:37.340]   That would bother me, the spacing,
[02:34:37.340 --> 02:34:39.000]   the kerning between the letters.
[02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:45.940]   It's hard for me to let go of the smallest,
[02:34:45.940 --> 02:34:47.320]   smallest, smallest details.
[02:34:47.320 --> 02:34:50.880]   I drive myself nuts, and I have no doubt
[02:34:50.880 --> 02:34:53.140]   that I sometimes, hopefully sometimes,
[02:34:53.140 --> 02:34:54.780]   drive my crew nuts.
[02:34:54.780 --> 02:34:56.320]   - And believe me, I can relate.
[02:34:56.320 --> 02:35:01.740]   - Grant Hackett's, a chef from Maligna,
[02:35:01.740 --> 02:35:03.920]   a dear friend and one of the greatest minds,
[02:35:03.920 --> 02:35:06.120]   one of the smallest people I've ever met.
[02:35:06.120 --> 02:35:08.980]   He's a chef.
[02:35:08.980 --> 02:35:11.860]   He makes food, but you know he cares
[02:35:11.860 --> 02:35:16.540]   about the plate that the food is gonna live in.
[02:35:16.540 --> 02:35:19.140]   So he has a guy design the plate
[02:35:19.140 --> 02:35:22.140]   for the food that's gonna be on top of it.
[02:35:22.140 --> 02:35:25.060]   What's the smell in the restaurant?
[02:35:25.060 --> 02:35:26.060]   What's the temperature?
[02:35:26.060 --> 02:35:27.060]   What's the carpet like?
[02:35:27.060 --> 02:35:27.940]   What's the color?
[02:35:27.940 --> 02:35:30.020]   Everything counts.
[02:35:30.020 --> 02:35:31.660]   There's nothing, like for example,
[02:35:31.660 --> 02:35:34.580]   I know fine restaurants do this a lot,
[02:35:34.580 --> 02:35:36.380]   but it's a nice detail.
[02:35:36.380 --> 02:35:38.820]   In his restaurant, when you go to Alenia,
[02:35:38.820 --> 02:35:41.460]   they know, with you it's gonna be easy
[02:35:41.460 --> 02:35:43.140]   'cause you're very recognizable,
[02:35:43.140 --> 02:35:45.060]   but they immediately know your name.
[02:35:45.060 --> 02:35:49.100]   No matter who it is, the entire crew,
[02:35:49.100 --> 02:35:51.540]   every person in the restaurant knows
[02:35:51.540 --> 02:35:53.380]   what you look like and what's your name,
[02:35:53.380 --> 02:35:56.140]   and they will address you by your name.
[02:35:56.140 --> 02:35:58.020]   That's amazing to me.
[02:35:58.020 --> 02:36:00.820]   Allegedly, it's got nothing to do with food.
[02:36:01.700 --> 02:36:05.820]   And yet it does, 'cause everything counts.
[02:36:05.820 --> 02:36:07.420]   And that's the life I live.
[02:36:07.420 --> 02:36:08.380]   Everything counts.
[02:36:08.380 --> 02:36:10.140]   Every detail is important.
[02:36:10.140 --> 02:36:11.260]   Nothing is too small.
[02:36:11.260 --> 02:36:13.680]   I drive everybody nuts, that's the truth.
[02:36:13.680 --> 02:36:15.180]   And I'm included.
[02:36:15.180 --> 02:36:17.740]   - Yeah, no, it's really important for people to hear
[02:36:17.740 --> 02:36:19.600]   because, well, I know for myself,
[02:36:19.600 --> 02:36:23.780]   when I see things that irritate me
[02:36:23.780 --> 02:36:26.220]   because of the way they're composed or something,
[02:36:26.220 --> 02:36:29.480]   I've had to learn over the years to,
[02:36:29.480 --> 02:36:32.220]   I always say I don't run other people's businesses.
[02:36:32.220 --> 02:36:34.180]   I'm focused on my stuff.
[02:36:34.180 --> 02:36:35.740]   I don't get involved in other people's art.
[02:36:35.740 --> 02:36:39.220]   But when I see things that I love and that look right,
[02:36:39.220 --> 02:36:40.880]   yeah, it's so satisfying.
[02:36:40.880 --> 02:36:45.880]   But to be in the world as you are, or as I am perhaps,
[02:36:45.880 --> 02:36:47.740]   it can be frustrating.
[02:36:47.740 --> 02:36:49.900]   So we need selective filters, right?
[02:36:49.900 --> 02:36:53.700]   So I guess provided that it's aimed at our craft
[02:36:53.700 --> 02:36:55.660]   and that people aim at their craft
[02:36:55.660 --> 02:36:58.340]   and what they're creating, then it's great.
[02:36:58.340 --> 02:37:01.600]   But it's tricky if one is trying to engage
[02:37:01.600 --> 02:37:03.360]   with the world at large
[02:37:03.360 --> 02:37:05.720]   to not let this stuff kind of bombard the senses.
[02:37:05.720 --> 02:37:08.840]   It can be, like for somebody that loves great food,
[02:37:08.840 --> 02:37:09.680]   it must be frustrating
[02:37:09.680 --> 02:37:10.960]   to walk down the street in Manhattan.
[02:37:10.960 --> 02:37:14.040]   The smells range from delightful to horrible.
[02:37:14.040 --> 02:37:18.540]   So we're a peculiar species, us humans,
[02:37:18.540 --> 02:37:21.720]   but it's the species that have these unique tunings
[02:37:21.720 --> 02:37:24.200]   and these preferences and they lean into those preferences
[02:37:24.200 --> 02:37:28.860]   and how they create that produce the marvelous work
[02:37:28.860 --> 02:37:31.460]   that is your magic and Van Gogh's.
[02:37:31.460 --> 02:37:34.780]   - That's a, you put me in a good category here.
[02:37:34.780 --> 02:37:35.980]   - Well, we need- - Well, thank you.
[02:37:35.980 --> 02:37:38.220]   - Yeah, we need, well, you are,
[02:37:38.220 --> 02:37:40.500]   and we need people like you.
[02:37:40.500 --> 02:37:43.420]   So for you, if you're drawing from many things
[02:37:43.420 --> 02:37:46.900]   and there's anger about something you see in the world,
[02:37:46.900 --> 02:37:51.180]   frustration, are you able to transmute that into your craft
[02:37:51.180 --> 02:37:52.740]   or is it a process of, okay,
[02:37:52.740 --> 02:37:55.120]   I got to dump that, move that out
[02:37:55.120 --> 02:37:56.920]   so that I can focus on beauty,
[02:37:56.920 --> 02:38:00.280]   focus on positive inspiration?
[02:38:00.280 --> 02:38:02.440]   Or can anger and frustration play a role?
[02:38:02.440 --> 02:38:05.400]   - I think there is beauty even in the ugly.
[02:38:05.400 --> 02:38:07.360]   I mean, look, you're right.
[02:38:07.360 --> 02:38:08.800]   I live in New York.
[02:38:08.800 --> 02:38:11.480]   It's my favorite city in the world
[02:38:11.480 --> 02:38:14.840]   and it's a love-hate relationship.
[02:38:14.840 --> 02:38:16.800]   It's ugly and beautiful at the same time.
[02:38:16.800 --> 02:38:17.880]   It's rich and poor.
[02:38:17.880 --> 02:38:20.320]   It's sophisticated and simple.
[02:38:21.300 --> 02:38:22.840]   It's a city of opposites.
[02:38:22.840 --> 02:38:29.820]   These are things I always think about.
[02:38:29.820 --> 02:38:33.860]   Like, you go and you see like this area
[02:38:33.860 --> 02:38:35.140]   that's really run down
[02:38:35.140 --> 02:38:39.180]   and the signs are kind of like fading and this,
[02:38:39.180 --> 02:38:42.320]   and you can think, wow, people are not taking care of it.
[02:38:42.320 --> 02:38:43.500]   They're not cleaning this.
[02:38:43.500 --> 02:38:44.980]   It's ugly.
[02:38:44.980 --> 02:38:46.660]   But you know what?
[02:38:46.660 --> 02:38:48.340]   When I have my camera on me,
[02:38:48.340 --> 02:38:51.040]   that's what I want to take a photo of.
[02:38:51.040 --> 02:38:54.840]   It has character and it tells an amazing story.
[02:38:54.840 --> 02:38:59.600]   So to me, the ugly, the old,
[02:38:59.600 --> 02:39:03.480]   the wrinkled, the not so beautiful
[02:39:03.480 --> 02:39:06.300]   is very interesting and beautiful.
[02:39:06.300 --> 02:39:11.040]   And again, it's not that I think about it
[02:39:11.040 --> 02:39:12.200]   and then I make the choice.
[02:39:12.200 --> 02:39:15.960]   I first respond and then maybe I'll think about it.
[02:39:17.440 --> 02:39:19.760]   I usually have a camera on me at all times.
[02:39:19.760 --> 02:39:22.520]   The rule is very simple.
[02:39:22.520 --> 02:39:27.520]   I don't take a photo until something tickles me.
[02:39:27.520 --> 02:39:29.840]   Says, "Take a photo here."
[02:39:29.840 --> 02:39:31.320]   And I take a photo.
[02:39:31.320 --> 02:39:32.920]   Some are good, some are bad.
[02:39:32.920 --> 02:39:33.760]   I don't care.
[02:39:33.760 --> 02:39:37.900]   But something in that moment made me want to do this
[02:39:37.900 --> 02:39:39.480]   and take a photo.
[02:39:39.480 --> 02:39:41.240]   And a lot of times,
[02:39:41.240 --> 02:39:46.240]   it's not the obvious, pretty, clean stuff.
[02:39:46.520 --> 02:39:50.100]   It's sometimes the ugly, the violent.
[02:39:50.100 --> 02:39:55.280]   Some of the most beautiful photos ever taken
[02:39:55.280 --> 02:39:58.640]   are taken at war by Bersan, right?
[02:39:58.640 --> 02:40:03.180]   It's us.
[02:40:03.180 --> 02:40:04.960]   It's us.
[02:40:04.960 --> 02:40:08.180]   And we're interesting, even when we're ugly.
[02:40:08.180 --> 02:40:11.880]   And when we're angry, we're still interesting.
[02:40:11.880 --> 02:40:13.600]   So to me, that's...
[02:40:13.600 --> 02:40:15.760]   Yeah, I don't know if I make a distinction.
[02:40:16.720 --> 02:40:18.940]   - That's very helpful, by the way.
[02:40:18.940 --> 02:40:24.480]   Were you always sensory and emotionally tuned
[02:40:24.480 --> 02:40:26.320]   to the world around you since you were little?
[02:40:26.320 --> 02:40:29.200]   Do you feel like you could feel your way through the world?
[02:40:29.200 --> 02:40:30.700]   This I like, this I don't like.
[02:40:30.700 --> 02:40:35.080]   Like kind of sensing things at a...
[02:40:35.080 --> 02:40:38.000]   It seems to me that you are able to detect things,
[02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:40.980]   people, experiences with a lot of texture.
[02:40:40.980 --> 02:40:45.040]   - It's hard for me to think outside myself.
[02:40:45.040 --> 02:40:45.880]   That's the way I think.
[02:40:45.880 --> 02:40:47.160]   I don't know any other way.
[02:40:47.160 --> 02:40:48.000]   - I'm not a therapist,
[02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:52.600]   but I'm just reflecting on creatives that I know.
[02:40:52.600 --> 02:40:56.400]   And you seem to fall into this category of like,
[02:40:56.400 --> 02:40:59.120]   things affect you or have the potential to affect you.
[02:40:59.120 --> 02:41:01.400]   And so your nervous system is tuned to observe
[02:41:01.400 --> 02:41:03.160]   and to absorb.
[02:41:03.160 --> 02:41:05.040]   Fortunately, you have a selective filter there
[02:41:05.040 --> 02:41:08.440]   'cause you can't be bombarded by life or stuck there.
[02:41:08.440 --> 02:41:10.240]   But do you recall being a kid?
[02:41:10.240 --> 02:41:12.760]   And like, do you have like visual
[02:41:12.760 --> 02:41:15.040]   and emotional memories of things that are strong?
[02:41:15.040 --> 02:41:18.080]   - I think I'm very sensitive.
[02:41:18.080 --> 02:41:20.200]   I think I get...
[02:41:20.200 --> 02:41:22.600]   I'm ticklish, you know, it's...
[02:41:22.600 --> 02:41:28.740]   I think with my heart as much as I think with my brain.
[02:41:28.740 --> 02:41:29.740]   I really think so.
[02:41:29.740 --> 02:41:34.740]   I am, you know, I wanna think I have thick skin.
[02:41:34.740 --> 02:41:36.520]   I don't.
[02:41:36.520 --> 02:41:39.080]   I get hurt easily.
[02:41:39.080 --> 02:41:41.620]   I have empathy.
[02:41:42.460 --> 02:41:47.460]   It happens to me often that I remember walking in New York,
[02:41:47.460 --> 02:41:49.780]   I cry easily.
[02:41:49.780 --> 02:41:52.160]   And I saw just a person crying,
[02:41:52.160 --> 02:41:54.860]   but I could feel their pain.
[02:41:54.860 --> 02:41:55.940]   I don't know this person.
[02:41:55.940 --> 02:41:57.540]   I started crying.
[02:41:57.540 --> 02:41:58.500]   And I think,
[02:41:58.500 --> 02:42:09.540]   you know, a big part of why I love being a magician
[02:42:11.580 --> 02:42:13.580]   is because I'm a part of a family
[02:42:13.580 --> 02:42:18.580]   that I will not replace with any other family.
[02:42:18.580 --> 02:42:22.840]   Like my best friends, John Graham, Shimshi, Blaine,
[02:42:22.840 --> 02:42:27.260]   Doug McKenzie, these are very important people in my life.
[02:42:27.260 --> 02:42:32.100]   And I'm moved by the fact that,
[02:42:32.100 --> 02:42:34.520]   you know, I wanted to do a couple of card tricks.
[02:42:34.520 --> 02:42:36.180]   I wanted to do magic,
[02:42:36.180 --> 02:42:39.620]   but I got something really way, way...
[02:42:39.620 --> 02:42:42.260]   It's a family, I've joined a family.
[02:42:42.260 --> 02:42:45.540]   Juan, who I talk and quote a million times,
[02:42:45.540 --> 02:42:47.900]   I feel like, you know, what a privilege.
[02:42:47.900 --> 02:42:52.900]   You know, this master gave me so many gifts,
[02:42:52.900 --> 02:42:56.940]   taught me so many things for no other reason
[02:42:56.940 --> 02:42:59.420]   than wanting to share something with me.
[02:42:59.420 --> 02:43:03.640]   I'm in awe of that.
[02:43:03.640 --> 02:43:06.900]   And it reminds me that I now need to do it
[02:43:06.900 --> 02:43:08.700]   with other people.
[02:43:08.700 --> 02:43:12.620]   So when we did Inner Circle, we grew a family.
[02:43:12.620 --> 02:43:14.320]   There's a bunch of kids, you know,
[02:43:14.320 --> 02:43:18.620]   Jacob, Denny, Luke.
[02:43:18.620 --> 02:43:19.980]   - You remember their names.
[02:43:19.980 --> 02:43:20.820]   - Yes, I do.
[02:43:20.820 --> 02:43:23.600]   Charlie, Struth, Ari.
[02:43:23.600 --> 02:43:28.020]   There's a bunch, and we became a family.
[02:43:28.020 --> 02:43:31.200]   I remember that I got an award from the Magic Castle,
[02:43:31.200 --> 02:43:34.240]   which is a flattering thing.
[02:43:34.240 --> 02:43:36.020]   And you spoke about awards.
[02:43:36.020 --> 02:43:37.580]   I appreciate awards,
[02:43:37.580 --> 02:43:40.700]   but I think awards could be very deceiving.
[02:43:40.700 --> 02:43:42.980]   So immediately when I got my award,
[02:43:42.980 --> 02:43:45.840]   I got Magician of the Year, which is very flattering.
[02:43:45.840 --> 02:43:48.040]   I looked at it for exactly 10 minutes.
[02:43:48.040 --> 02:43:50.360]   I closed it and I gave it to somebody.
[02:43:50.360 --> 02:43:51.980]   I did not want to own it.
[02:43:51.980 --> 02:43:56.060]   But here's the story that I'm trying to tell you here.
[02:43:56.060 --> 02:43:59.020]   So I had to fly from New York to Los Angeles
[02:43:59.020 --> 02:44:00.780]   to receive the award.
[02:44:00.780 --> 02:44:03.860]   And one of the kids said, "Can I join you?"
[02:44:03.860 --> 02:44:05.500]   I said, "Sure, but you have to buy your own ticket
[02:44:05.500 --> 02:44:07.900]   and, you know, Airbnb, whatever."
[02:44:07.900 --> 02:44:12.860]   And then another one, and all of them came with me,
[02:44:12.860 --> 02:44:16.060]   all of them to see me get an award.
[02:44:16.060 --> 02:44:21.060]   And I remember the award became secondary
[02:44:21.060 --> 02:44:26.540]   to the fact that they came to see me get an award.
[02:44:26.540 --> 02:44:28.520]   So we went to get coffee,
[02:44:28.520 --> 02:44:30.860]   and I took them to the Magic Castle for the first time.
[02:44:30.860 --> 02:44:31.780]   I made them perform.
[02:44:31.780 --> 02:44:33.220]   We went downstairs to the basement.
[02:44:33.220 --> 02:44:34.860]   I said, "You're performing now."
[02:44:34.860 --> 02:44:37.740]   And it was a highlight for them.
[02:44:37.740 --> 02:44:40.860]   And I, that was my award.
[02:44:40.860 --> 02:44:44.100]   - It's so interesting because once again,
[02:44:44.100 --> 02:44:46.220]   it's the story of the experience
[02:44:46.220 --> 02:44:49.500]   as opposed to the end product of the experience.
[02:44:49.500 --> 02:44:52.340]   That is what captures us.
[02:44:52.340 --> 02:44:54.900]   And it's clearly how we embed memory
[02:44:54.900 --> 02:44:59.180]   and how we come up with concepts of self in our life arc.
[02:44:59.180 --> 02:45:00.300]   It's really beautiful.
[02:45:00.300 --> 02:45:04.280]   And in your case, it's about magic and mentalist work,
[02:45:04.280 --> 02:45:09.280]   but it clearly exports to all domains of life.
[02:45:09.280 --> 02:45:15.300]   Certain people are getting it, to put it that way.
[02:45:15.300 --> 02:45:20.540]   Speaking of the arc of life, tell us what's coming next.
[02:45:20.540 --> 02:45:24.100]   What's the next act?
[02:45:24.100 --> 02:45:27.260]   What's the next, I don't want to call it a trick
[02:45:27.260 --> 02:45:30.160]   because it diminishes from your craft, your art.
[02:45:30.160 --> 02:45:33.980]   What excites you most these days
[02:45:33.980 --> 02:45:36.840]   about what's coming next in your professional life?
[02:45:36.840 --> 02:45:41.840]   - So I'm now just about to debut my next show,
[02:45:41.840 --> 02:45:43.620]   which is "Incredibly Human."
[02:45:43.620 --> 02:45:46.620]   I'm super excited about this show
[02:45:46.620 --> 02:45:50.580]   because in a strange way,
[02:45:50.580 --> 02:45:54.140]   that show is this conversation we just had.
[02:45:54.140 --> 02:45:55.680]   It's about the human mind.
[02:45:55.680 --> 02:45:57.100]   It's about what we can do.
[02:45:57.100 --> 02:45:58.380]   It's about pushing limits.
[02:45:58.380 --> 02:46:01.140]   It's about kind of proving to ourselves
[02:46:01.140 --> 02:46:03.040]   of how magnificent we are.
[02:46:03.040 --> 02:46:07.820]   So that, it's a very, you know,
[02:46:07.820 --> 02:46:09.940]   it's very different than my first show, "Inner Circle,"
[02:46:09.940 --> 02:46:11.340]   because this one is in theaters.
[02:46:11.340 --> 02:46:14.940]   It's in, you know, a thousand-some seats, you know, theaters.
[02:46:14.940 --> 02:46:19.940]   And it's, what I wanted this show to be visual.
[02:46:19.940 --> 02:46:22.520]   I want to have a painterly quality to it.
[02:46:22.520 --> 02:46:25.460]   So there's lots of things that are just going to paint
[02:46:25.460 --> 02:46:26.780]   the stage with lots of things.
[02:46:26.780 --> 02:46:28.900]   I can't, I don't want to spoil anything,
[02:46:28.900 --> 02:46:31.140]   but it is a tribute to the human mind.
[02:46:31.140 --> 02:46:32.260]   I'm excited about doing it.
[02:46:32.260 --> 02:46:35.000]   We have so far announced six dates,
[02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:38.540]   and there's two more big things coming up
[02:46:38.540 --> 02:46:43.300]   that I cannot talk about that are very exciting,
[02:46:43.300 --> 02:46:45.940]   but they're brewing slowly.
[02:46:45.940 --> 02:46:47.980]   But for me right now,
[02:46:47.980 --> 02:46:52.160]   this show that I'm about to do is the most exciting thing,
[02:46:52.160 --> 02:46:55.700]   figuring out how to make the best version of that show.
[02:46:56.540 --> 02:46:58.660]   - Fantastic.
[02:46:58.660 --> 02:47:03.660]   Well, Asi, I want to say on behalf of myself
[02:47:03.660 --> 02:47:05.540]   and everyone listening and watching,
[02:47:05.540 --> 02:47:11.340]   you are a truly unique and spectacular individual.
[02:47:11.340 --> 02:47:12.260]   - Thank you.
[02:47:12.260 --> 02:47:14.580]   - Both for the work that you do
[02:47:14.580 --> 02:47:16.780]   and the way you approach it,
[02:47:16.780 --> 02:47:19.460]   but also for what you teach us about ourselves,
[02:47:19.460 --> 02:47:23.140]   about the human mind and brain,
[02:47:23.140 --> 02:47:25.740]   about what makes us tick,
[02:47:25.740 --> 02:47:29.100]   indeed, what's possible in us.
[02:47:29.100 --> 02:47:31.660]   I mean, it's just ringing over and over again in my head
[02:47:31.660 --> 02:47:35.220]   that what you do is less about showing
[02:47:35.220 --> 02:47:36.380]   what's possible in the world.
[02:47:36.380 --> 02:47:37.380]   A card can do this,
[02:47:37.380 --> 02:47:41.180]   or it's about what's possible inside of us,
[02:47:41.180 --> 02:47:42.540]   both alone and in groups,
[02:47:42.540 --> 02:47:46.140]   and as it relates to perception and imagination.
[02:47:46.140 --> 02:47:48.420]   It's really, truly spectacular.
[02:47:48.420 --> 02:47:50.620]   And I say that having, again,
[02:47:50.620 --> 02:47:54.460]   seen you do your acts live and seen some online,
[02:47:54.460 --> 02:47:58.340]   and I'll certainly come out to the upcoming show
[02:47:58.340 --> 02:48:01.620]   and the mystery shows that I'm not allowed to know about.
[02:48:01.620 --> 02:48:04.580]   I also would be remiss if I didn't say
[02:48:04.580 --> 02:48:07.460]   that this empathy that you have
[02:48:07.460 --> 02:48:09.980]   and the fact that you, as you described it,
[02:48:09.980 --> 02:48:11.600]   you think with your heart.
[02:48:11.600 --> 02:48:15.040]   I don't know much about your life
[02:48:15.040 --> 02:48:17.020]   aside from what you've told us here today,
[02:48:17.060 --> 02:48:22.060]   but I imagine that can be a challenging experience at times
[02:48:22.060 --> 02:48:24.220]   to live life that way, that sensitivity.
[02:48:24.220 --> 02:48:26.620]   But I just want to say thank you.
[02:48:26.620 --> 02:48:30.460]   We are all gifted this magic, true magic, that you do
[02:48:30.460 --> 02:48:33.140]   because of the way that you think with your heart
[02:48:33.140 --> 02:48:36.440]   and your empathy and your openness and willingness to share.
[02:48:36.440 --> 02:48:39.060]   While you did not reveal how every trick is done.
[02:48:39.060 --> 02:48:40.660]   - Sorry.
[02:48:40.660 --> 02:48:43.020]   - You made it very clear that to do so
[02:48:43.020 --> 02:48:47.580]   would be to erase some of what's possible in us.
[02:48:47.580 --> 02:48:52.580]   And so I also place great value on the fact
[02:48:52.580 --> 02:48:55.180]   that you've kept some of the mystery,
[02:48:55.180 --> 02:48:59.420]   or let's say much of the mystery of magic
[02:48:59.420 --> 02:49:02.640]   and mentalist work a secret to us
[02:49:02.640 --> 02:49:05.860]   so that we can have it revealed to us in real time
[02:49:05.860 --> 02:49:08.540]   through your shows and other venues
[02:49:08.540 --> 02:49:09.900]   for magic and mentalist work.
[02:49:09.900 --> 02:49:13.260]   So on behalf of myself and everyone listening,
[02:49:13.260 --> 02:49:15.500]   I just want to extend an enormous debt of gratitude
[02:49:15.500 --> 02:49:18.140]   for what you do and for being you.
[02:49:18.140 --> 02:49:19.820]   Thank you so much.
[02:49:19.820 --> 02:49:21.060]   - It means a lot, thanks.
[02:49:21.060 --> 02:49:23.100]   - Thank you for joining me

[02:50:10.680 --> 02:50:12.840]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:50:12.840 --> 02:50:14.960]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:50:14.960 --> 02:50:16.460]   for things like improving sleep,
[02:50:16.460 --> 02:50:18.920]   for hormone support, and for improving focus.
[02:50:18.920 --> 02:50:20.160]   To learn more about the supplements
[02:50:20.160 --> 02:50:21.960]   discussed on the Huberman Lab podcast,
[02:50:21.960 --> 02:50:24.200]   go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S.
[02:50:24.200 --> 02:50:27.200]   So it's livemomentous.com/huberman.
[02:50:27.200 --> 02:50:29.280]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[02:50:29.280 --> 02:50:31.960]   I'm Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[02:50:31.960 --> 02:50:34.740]   So that's Instagram, X, Twitter, LinkedIn,
[02:50:34.740 --> 02:50:36.140]   Facebook, and Threads.
[02:50:36.140 --> 02:50:37.460]   And at all of those places,
[02:50:37.460 --> 02:50:39.940]   I discuss science and science-related tools,
[02:50:39.940 --> 02:50:41.460]   some of which overlap with the content
[02:50:41.460 --> 02:50:42.660]   of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[02:50:42.660 --> 02:50:44.780]   but much of which are distinct from the content
[02:50:44.780 --> 02:50:46.020]   of the Huberman Lab podcast.
[02:50:46.020 --> 02:50:48.980]   So again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media channels.
[02:50:48.980 --> 02:50:50.100]   If you haven't already subscribed
[02:50:50.100 --> 02:50:51.780]   to our Neural Network newsletter,
[02:50:51.780 --> 02:50:53.060]   the Neural Network newsletter
[02:50:53.060 --> 02:50:55.240]   is our zero-cost monthly newsletter
[02:50:55.240 --> 02:50:57.280]   that has podcast summaries and protocols
[02:50:57.280 --> 02:51:00.460]   in the form of brief one-to-three-page PDFs
[02:51:00.460 --> 02:51:03.200]   that spell out for you in very clear terms
[02:51:03.200 --> 02:51:06.480]   how, for instance, to optimize your physical health,
[02:51:06.480 --> 02:51:09.520]   how to optimize dopamine, how to improve your sleep,
[02:51:09.520 --> 02:51:11.660]   how to learn better through neuroplasticity,
[02:51:11.660 --> 02:51:14.520]   deliberate cold exposure, heat exposure, and on and on.
[02:51:14.520 --> 02:51:16.080]   Again, all completely zero cost.
[02:51:16.080 --> 02:51:17.940]   To sign up for the Neural Network newsletter,
[02:51:17.940 --> 02:51:20.920]   you simply go to hubermanlab.com, go to the Menu tab,
[02:51:20.920 --> 02:51:23.220]   scroll down to Newsletter, and enter your email.
[02:51:23.220 --> 02:51:25.540]   We do not share your email with anybody.
[02:51:25.540 --> 02:51:27.400]   Thank you for joining me for today's discussion
[02:51:27.400 --> 02:51:28.680]   with Ossie Wind.
[02:51:28.680 --> 02:51:30.840]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:51:30.840 --> 02:51:32.800]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:51:32.800 --> 02:51:35.380]   (upbeat music)
[02:51:35.380 --> 02:51:37.960]   (upbeat music)
