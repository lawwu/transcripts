[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360]   Hey podcast listeners, this is Tony. Today I had hoped to get you audio from our
[00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.840]   first ever APJ live recording recently in Nashville with Pastor John and I on
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.160]   stage together. That audio is being delayed, so here's a different episode to
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.240]   stand in while we wait. Thanks for your patience.
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.000]   Well sometimes the best questions are the simplest ones like, "Who is John
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.640]   Piper? Where did he come from? How was he saved? And how did he become a preacher?"
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.760]   The very types of questions asked of him during a recent ministry trip to
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:38.160]   Belfast. Keith Getty, the Northern Irish Christian singer and songwriter, asked
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.840]   the questions. Here today is the interchange that they had in Belfast.
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.000]   Have a listen. I suspect most people in this place have been influenced over the
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.720]   years either directly by your preaching, your books, podcasts, whatever, or
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:58.360]   indirectly through those who have. And so we want you to know that we are, we
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.000]   owe you a debt of gratitude for your faithful service and we are so
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.720]   grateful to you for that. Yes indeed.
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:15.200]   By way of broad introduction, tell us about yourself, your journey to faith, a
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:24.240]   short biography, and actually what you're doing now. I don't remember being
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:33.960]   converted, which I am happy with because I think we learn the wonder of
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.800]   conversion not primarily through remembered experiences but through the
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:48.560]   Word of God. I think if you think you have a handle on the majesty and
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.920]   magnificence and wonder of your conversion because you remember it and
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:01.720]   how glorious the transition was, you don't know a fraction of it because you
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:09.480]   can't know the miracle without being told by God what happened there. So my
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:18.120]   mother told me that when I was six in a motel in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, I
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:26.920]   became convicted of my sin and asked her what I could do and she knelt with me by
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:33.280]   the bed in the motel room and led me in a prayer of confession of my sin and
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:41.440]   faith in Jesus. And I don't remember any of that. And so it doesn't matter to me
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:50.000]   whether that's a true story or not. What matters to me is that today I see. When I
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.920]   began to see is not of the essence. Once upon a time the devil was blinding the
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:03.960]   minds of an unbeliever and God said, "Let there be light." 2nd Corinthians 4 verse 6.
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.680]   He said, "Let there be light." And whether a six-year-old or a 14-year-old or a
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.960]   23-year-old discovering God-centeredness was the first seeing doesn't matter much
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:23.240]   to me. What matters to me is that I see by grace. So I'm not sure what the
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:28.920]   pilgrimage was. I never remember being an unbeliever and I'm thankful for that. I
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.480]   never remember rebelling against my parents. I think one of the most
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.160]   helpful things for me to say here in this context would be that my father
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.200]   would have self-identified as a fundamentalist of the good old Southern
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:50.640]   American variety. And you would think that a fellow like me would grow up and
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:57.040]   kick against the standards that were used. And I never did. And I've tried to
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.000]   figure out why that is because I know a lot of people who grew up in homes sort
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:11.520]   of like mine who did kick, rebel, leave, and never come back. But I think one of
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:17.880]   the means God used to keep that from happening was that my father was the
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:25.920]   happiest man I've ever known. He and my mother would sing in the front seat of
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:32.400]   our old Buick driving from Greenville, South Carolina to Daytona Beach for our
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:39.640]   annual 10-day beach vacation. And my sister and I in the back seat listening
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:47.520]   to my mother and father sing gospel choruses. I mean that's extraordinary.
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.520]   That's extraordinary. And not only did he sing but when he came back from
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.480]   evangelistic crusades, he was an evangelist, he would come back with
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:04.800]   stories of triumph about the gospel and a new joke. And he laughed harder at his
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:11.200]   own jokes than anybody. And my mother laughed next hardest until the
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.240]   tears would roll down her cheek. And my sister and I would sit there looking at
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:21.240]   each end of the table saying, "I think they're having a good time enjoying Jesus."
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:29.200]   Why would anybody want to go to a movie or dance or smoke? I mean I just never
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:39.160]   kicked because I lived in a glorious family. So that brings me to... where do I
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.320]   go from there? You went to college then? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:51.440]   Okay, off to Wheaton College, literature major, met Noel Henry on an auspicious
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:06:04.880]   date 6-6-66. We just celebrated our 53rd 6-6-66.
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:16.120]   Straightway got mono and was in the hospital for three weeks and decided not
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:20.560]   to be a medical doctor but to go to seminary because I was listening to John
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:29.080]   Harold Ockengay preach 200 yards away in the Wheaton Chapel. And as I lay there
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:36.320]   with my big yellow tonsils and my palpitating spleen said to myself, "I can't
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:42.120]   do anything to do what he's doing right now, opening the Word of God." I said, "That's
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:51.040]   glorious." And so my girlfriend had fallen into love with a pre-med student
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:59.280]   and so I did a bait-and-switch on her and said, "I think I'm gonna go to seminary
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:05.520]   not medical school." And she was okay with that. So we went to Fuller Seminary
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:10.720]   and had the most influential teacher of my life there, Daniel Fuller, who
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.520]   did two things. He showed me a magnificent view of a sovereign God,
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:18.600]   especially through the lens of Jonathan Edwards. And then he gave me an
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:23.360]   exegetical method called arching, which takes every word, every phrase, every
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:28.440]   sentence of the Bible with blood, earnest seriousness, and rings it until every
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:33.180]   drop of life-giving blood falls out of it on the page. And I've never been the
[00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:36.600]   same since. That's why I talked last night about being 23 years old, because I was
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:40.480]   22 when I went there and by the time I was 23 I was a different
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:45.640]   human being. And Noel was walking on that pilgrimage with me. Then I went to
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:50.360]   Germany for three years and got a degree in New Testament. Then I taught for six
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:54.640]   years at Bethel College in St. Paul, Minnesota. Taught Bible and Greek. And
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:08:02.080]   then God stepped into my life in a most remarkable way on October 14, 1979.
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:06.360]   I mean, Pascal, I don't know if you've ever read Pascal's conversion story, but he
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:10.800]   carried all of his life long until his grave, he carried inside his coat, sewn
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:14.640]   into his coat, a piece of paper where he had written down, and I don't remember
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:23.040]   the date, but he put down, "The date, midnight, fire." And met God. And I didn't
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:31.680]   meet God, but I met a call to preaching that was, at that point, irresistible.
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:36.200]   Waited for Noel to wake up the next morning thinking, "Okay, this is another
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:41.400]   bait-and-switch here." Because being a teacher is cool, you know, Mr. Academics,
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:45.480]   and no big pressure on the wife if you're a professor, but if you become a
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:51.600]   pastor, whoa, this is big for both of you. And so I'm lying there at 6:30 in the
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:55.720]   morning having been up half the night wrestling with God and thinking,
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:59.760]   "She's got to say yes, because if she doesn't say yes, we're in big trouble.
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:06.240]   God just spoke." But you don't go off without your wife, right? You two have
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:11.880]   become one flesh. And I leaned over when she got up and said, "What would you think
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:20.040]   if I resigned at Bethel and looked for a church?" And she said, "I could see that
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:29.440]   coming." And what she meant was a couple of years of watching me in church, and if
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:36.720]   it was a mediocre sermon, I'd say, "We've got to do better than that." And if it was a great sermon, I
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:45.240]   would say, "I would love to do that." So I went to my denomination and said, "I'm
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:49.760]   available. Find me a church. Help me. Help me." And they sent me to Bethlehem, and I
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:58.240]   was there for 33 years until 2013. So 2013, I stepped away, not because I was
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:02.760]   tired of preaching, but because the church was big and complex and prosperous,
[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:09.280]   and I think I had Peter-principled myself out of a job. I mean, it's a big
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:16.680]   church. It's complicated. It had three campuses, 125 employees, and 20 pastors,
[00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:23.960]   and 40 elders, and I thought, "Oh my goodness. This is just over my managerial head."
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:29.920]   And so while I still had energy and life, God did a miracle. There's a lot of
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:33.480]   people here in this room right now who go to Bethlehem, and they will remember
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:39.640]   what a miracle He did of bringing in a man named Jason Meyer, and the church
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:44.440]   voted in a closed ballot. These are Baptists now. Remember, these are Baptists.
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:49.240]   They don't agree on anything. I think these guys, we've heard of Baptists.
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:55.800]   Yeah, and I think out of 890 votes or something like that, there were
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:11:02.440]   seven no votes on a closed ballot. So he was in tears, and we were all
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:06.800]   thrilled that God had found a person, and so I stepped away. I still go to the
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:10.120]   church, love it every minute of it, love corporate worship like crazy. We'll go
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:14.480]   there. So I was there for 33 years, and now I attend there, enjoy it. That's a nice
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:18.240]   little introduction to John Piper, and Pastor John, no longer in pastoral
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:23.080]   ministry, is now full-time at Desiring God, writing, preaching, traveling around
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:27.800]   the globe to minister in places like Belfast, and of course recording episodes
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:32.600]   for this podcast, too. We keep him pretty busy, and I recently asked Pastor John to
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.800]   explain that long night where he wrestled with God's calling to preach,
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:40.240]   and what he has to say to those of us who are wrestling with two good options.
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:45.280]   Which one does God call us to when we have two good options that are both God
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:49.560]   honoring? Kind of maps on to that night that he experienced, and we'll look at
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:53.720]   that huge date for him on the 40th anniversary of it, which is coming up on
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:57.880]   October 14th. Be watching for that episode. That one is recorded, done, and
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:02.560]   ready to go, and we continue to eagerly wait for audio to come in from our first
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:07.160]   ever APJ Live Sing session, Pastor John and I on stage in Nashville. It's been
[00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:10.160]   delayed, but I'll get you those episodes as soon as possible. We recorded those
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:14.800]   five episodes live on stage at the Gaylord Opryland Resort and Convention
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:20.800]   Center in Nashville. This was the very same site, ten years ago, to the month, to
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:26.520]   what I think is the weirdest John Piper preaching video you will ever see. So why
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:32.400]   did 8,000 Christian counselors laugh at John Piper? I have so many questions
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:35.760]   about this event. I know you have so many questions about watching the video.
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:39.760]   Together we will find out when I ask Pastor John about it next time on
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:44.440]   Friday. I'm your host Tony Reike. We'll see you then.
