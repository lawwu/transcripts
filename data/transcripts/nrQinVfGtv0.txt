[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240]   All right, Jesse, like we always do early in each month, I report back on the books
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.040]   I read during the preceding month.
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.360]   So we are in early June while recording this.
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.680]   So we will report back on the books I read in May.
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.200]   My goal as longtime listeners know is to try to read five books every month.
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:27.240]   If you want more details on how I do that, we actually have a video online at youtube.com/CalNewportMedia
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.200]   where I go through the different techniques I use to read five books a month and how other
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.440]   people can do it too.
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.800]   All right, five books I read in May 2022.
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:43.280]   Number one, I returned to Born Standing Up by Steve Martin.
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.480]   That's Steve Martin's professional memoir.
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.840]   I have read this before.
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.160]   I read this way back in 2009, soon after it came out.
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.040]   I wrote about it way back then in the early days of my blog.
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.560]   It was actually in an interview that Steve Martin did with Charlie Rose about Born Standing
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.440]   Up that he used the phrase, "Be so good they can't ignore you," which I then used or adapted
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.920]   to be the title of my fourth book, So Good They Can't Ignore You.
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.000]   So it was a very influential book in my life, but I have not been back to it since.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.080]   It's been over a decade since I read it.
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.360]   So I went back and I read it and it was great.
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.680]   There was a lot I had forgotten and I was able to extract a lot more rich detail.
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.000]   And again, what makes this a good book is that it is focused just on his professional
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   career.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.920]   Steve Martin's point with this book was he didn't think enough detail is often given
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.680]   in celebrity memoirs about how people actually build their careers.
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.680]   So this was just about the craft, how he built up his act, what went well, what didn't, his
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.800]   breaks, his steps back, how he moved forward again.
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.080]   So I thought it was very interesting.
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:56.480]   The main takeaway that hit me on the second time through was the power of sticking with
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.720]   it.
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.160]   It took Martin years for his act to break with a lot of steps backwards.
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.620]   And he was incredibly focused during those periods on continuing to polish and develop
[00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:08.620]   his act.
[00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:13.800]   And it was actually in the end, the confidence and expertise that was developed by that relentless
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.080]   focus and drive to improve that tipped him.
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.580]   His act was interesting, but once he became world-class at delivering it, that's what
[00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.320]   actually made it a world-class act because it was the confidence and precision that's
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.840]   necessary for his type of humor to work.
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.400]   So I was really struck by his focus.
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.760]   All right.
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:44.440]   Next I read Blood and Treasure, a newish biography of Daniel Boone by Rod Drury.
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:51.360]   Where's it Bob Drury, no Rod Drury, someone Drury and Tom Clavin.
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.080]   And I read it in part.
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.200]   I don't know if you know this about me, Jesse, but I am descended from the Boones.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.960]   I did not know that.
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.840]   Maybe I give off that frontiersman style genre.
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.480]   I'm not descended from Daniel Boone.
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.240]   I'm descended from his brother, which we figured out at some point, his brother who shows up
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.000]   off and on in the book.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:23.320]   So this was my, my grandmother, my paternal grandmother, let me see if I have this right.
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.020]   I think her mom was a Boone.
[00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:31.360]   So we're, we're actually not too far off the actual Boone line, but not from Daniel himself.
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.480]   And I do remember that growing up, we went to a Daniel Boone historical site and there's
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.840]   a register to sign if you're a descendant and they said, you're a descendant of his
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.340]   dad and his brother, but not of him.
[00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.040]   So we weren't, we weren't able to sign the book.
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.040]   Very well written.
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.040]   I actually really enjoyed blood and treasure.
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.240]   Must've been very difficult to research.
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:58.320]   I mean, the whole book is about the complicated shifting allegiances, alliances, and fail promises
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:04.120]   between all of the various different Indian tribes at this period of the colonial history.
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:11.460]   Daniel Boone's life was completely intermixed with the, the fight for land between the American
[00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:16.400]   colonists, the British, and the various Indian tribes that were there, or this tribe would
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.300]   take over that tribe and this tribe would come in.
[00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:24.280]   So it was, it was really a book about 18th century Indian tribal politics.
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.960]   So a complicated book to write, but very interesting.
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.460]   These were tougher people back then.
[00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:31.460]   These long hunters.
[00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.580]   They would just go, like, I'll be back in a year.
[00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.780]   Like I have a rifle and I'll be back in a year.
[00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.820]   I'm just going to hunt for a year.
[00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:39.820]   Like where are you going to go hunt?
[00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.380]   Oh, I'm going to, I'm going to hike to the other side of the Appalachian mountains and
[00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.140]   then I'll hunt over there.
[00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.420]   And then I'll come back with, with all of, all of the skins.
[00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:54.240]   I mean, these were, that was a tougher, tougher period, but I am a Boone.
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.980]   So I get through proxy, a lot of credit.
[00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:05.580]   Then I read why faith matters by rabbi David Volpe.
[00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:11.300]   I read this because I heard Lex Fridman interview him and I thought it was a, he was interesting.
[00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:12.300]   It was a really good interview.
[00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.300]   I thought it was really interesting.
[00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.500]   So I said, what's his most famous book was Volpe's most famous book.
[00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:17.500]   I think it's why faith matters.
[00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.060]   And I read it pretty good.
[00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.660]   So this was a, it's a post nine 11 book.
[00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:27.940]   Volpe wrote why faith matters as a response to the post nine 11 new atheist.
[00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:36.580]   So you remember those two early two thousands, you had Sam Harris, you had Hitchens Dawkins,
[00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.940]   and I guess Daniel did it maybe had a book in there too, breaking the spell.
[00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:45.260]   There was this sort of anti-religious new atheism that arose.
[00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.420]   And this was a response to that.
[00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:54.100]   It was a pretty interesting book from a roughly from a Jewish perspective, but, but relatively
[00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.100]   ecumenical, very accessible.
[00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.540]   I thought there was some interesting points in it.
[00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:04.420]   Then I went back and again, this is a reread, but a reread from my childhood.
[00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:11.140]   So I don't think it counts lost moon by James Lovell and Jeffrey Kluger.
[00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:13.540]   This book came out in the nineties when I was a kid.
[00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:20.180]   It is the book about Apollo 13 written by the Jim Lovell who Tom Hanks played in the
[00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.300]   movie and a professional science writer, Jeffrey Kluger.
[00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:33.860]   So Apollo 13, the Ron Howard movie was based off of this book was the main source material.
[00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:34.900]   Another cool book.
[00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:39.540]   They wrote it, they wrote it, narrate cinematically.
[00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:44.340]   So it's like in the room, in the room, real time narrative.
[00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:47.860]   Like this person said this, this person grabbed this thing, which is probably the right way.
[00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:52.300]   And it goes back and forth between mission control and the capsule.
[00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.740]   But it's written embedded in the action itself.
[00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:00.580]   So, you know, then Lovell hit the switch and this happened, not, there's not a, as not
[00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:04.880]   a third person narrator voice of like, then what was happening on the da da da da.
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.560]   So it really moves.
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:07.560]   And it's a crazy story.
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:14.500]   I mean, what happened on the, on the command module and what they had to do to save it.
[00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:19.100]   And Kluger just went back through transcript and transcript and they really picked apart
[00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:23.140]   what happened and the tick tock of how it unfolded and who said what.
[00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:24.500]   And so it's really an achievement as a book.
[00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:28.900]   I just, as a nonfiction writer, I can say this was, it's a fantastic story, obviously,
[00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:32.460]   I mean, stuck in space and you have to get saved.
[00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:36.740]   But to write this book is not an easy feat.
[00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:38.820]   I mean, it took a huge amount of research.
[00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:42.400]   So it's a real achievement as a book and incredibly interesting to read.
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:46.300]   So forget the movie, you gotta, you gotta read the book Lost Moon.
[00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:53.780]   And then finally I read the Lost City of Z by David Gran.
[00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:56.700]   So David Gran is a New Yorker writer.
[00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:03.360]   He's sort of a, I don't know if he's a target of envy, but he's sort of what you, sometimes
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:07.460]   what you imagine when you imagined when you're at Columbia journalism school and you're thinking
[00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:12.860]   what you want to do as a writer, what you imagine often is David Gran.
[00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:19.340]   So what he does for the New Yorker is he does these long form journalistic pieces where
[00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:25.940]   he usually goes on some sort of adventure with interesting people with interesting things
[00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:28.180]   happening.
[00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:36.060]   So there'll be some, you know, I think he did stuff with like white supremacist in jail
[00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:41.600]   at some point, there was like a murder in the, another book thing he did, another article,
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:46.340]   there was a murder among the Sherlock Holmes enthusiasts.
[00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:52.100]   Like there's this whole world of Sherlock Holmes enthusiasts that think that Sherlock
[00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:53.100]   Holmes was real.
[00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:58.480]   And there was this murder and David Gran is over there in England and gets in beds with
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:01.260]   these groups and it's really like the Baker street regulars.
[00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:09.100]   And anyways, Lost City of Z is a half of it is the story of Percy Fawcett, one of the
[00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:17.300]   last of the great British adventurers and explorers who disappeared trying to find this
[00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:21.060]   supposed giant city in the Amazon.
[00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:26.260]   So it tells the story, but the interleaves with David Gran going to the Amazon and actually
[00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:30.660]   putting together a team and going in himself to try to find some evidence of what they
[00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:31.660]   found.
[00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:40.100]   And, and, you know, spoiler alert turns out there were really large civilizations in the,
[00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:46.180]   in the Amazon, but a lot of it was hard to find because it was built with wood and a
[00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:47.180]   lot of that had decayed.
[00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:49.900]   But now with modern techniques, we can see there was all these sophisticated cities.
[00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:54.060]   So Percy Fawcett was right, but there's no way he was ever going to find it in, you know,
[00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:55.060]   the 1920s.
[00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:57.380]   Anyways, David Gran is great.
[00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:59.260]   He's the goat at these types of things.
[00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:00.780]   These things move, they're well researched.
[00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:04.660]   He inserts himself into it, sort of classic adventure narrative, nonfiction, New Yorker
[00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:05.740]   type stuff.
[00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:09.340]   So that book was fun.
[00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:11.700]   I should be more David Gran like Jesse.
[00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:15.940]   I need to actually like go, you know, on the trail of a murderer.
[00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:20.180]   Oh, a famous David Gran piece was hunting the giant squid.
[00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:24.460]   So he's out there on this boat with this guy, this eccentric guy, he's like convinced that
[00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:27.540]   they can catch a giant squid and he's out there in the storms and they're trying to
[00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:28.540]   find a squid.
[00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:29.540]   He loves that type of stuff.
[00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:32.340]   He puts himself, puts himself in the danger.
[00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:33.340]   Do you know him?
[00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:34.340]   Never met him.
[00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:38.340]   How old is he?
[00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:41.820]   Older than us, but I don't know, probably not that much older.
[00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:42.820]   We should look it up.
[00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:45.060]   I wonder how old he is.
[00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:47.300]   I should flex that more.
[00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.180]   I feel shy and nervous about it.
[00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:54.300]   I feel like I, but I should maybe flex more of the potential ability to talk to other
[00:10:54.300 --> 00:11:00.420]   New Yorker writers and say, just, can I call you?
[00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:01.420]   Can I call you?
[00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:07.140]   It feels a little bit, I don't know, Eddie Haskelly.
[00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:10.540]   Excuse me, Mr. Gran.
[00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:14.180]   I also do some writing for your esteemed publication there, sir.
[00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:16.460]   And uh, 55 years old.
[00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:17.460]   Okay.
[00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:18.940]   55 years old.
[00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:21.700]   And uh, I would like to talk to you on the telephone.
[00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:24.980]   The problem is if someone wrote me like that, I would be like, Oh, this is annoying.
[00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:30.860]   So, so I don't, but I'll tell you, I do want to before time is too short and I'm sure there's
[00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:32.420]   not much time left to do this.
[00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:39.260]   Just given his age, I really would like to meet John McPhee and I built the intro to
[00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:43.260]   the slow productivity around John McPhee.
[00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:47.220]   And I grew up near Princeton and I'm around there all the time.
[00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:52.500]   So I'm going to see, he's probably just goes, walks the campus, walks home.
[00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:53.500]   Yeah, he's older.
[00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:56.580]   And you know, I think he's in his upper eighties now, so I don't know exactly what the, what
[00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:59.420]   his situation is, but I would love to meet him once.
[00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:06.060]   Maybe that's one place I will do an Eddie Haskell flex like, ah, sir, I, uh, I write
[00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:10.980]   for your same esteemed publication and, uh, I would like to stop by and say hello.
[00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:15.380]   And uh, so I'll try that, but I think it would be cool for the opening of that book when
[00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:20.020]   I'm telling this story about his work habits and spending a whole year writing one article
[00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:25.100]   to be able to actually be there and see him would be cool.
[00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:26.620]   So, so I might try that.
[00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:32.540]   Well, as you said earlier, when you were talking about your plans for the deep life, you might
[00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:36.660]   be doing something related to David Gran, right?
[00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:39.860]   Yeah, maybe I could become a David Gran style writer.
[00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:40.860]   Yeah.
[00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:44.540]   Well, if you're going to do something deep life, I mean, that's kind of like going on
[00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:46.100]   a boat, trying to find a big squid.
[00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:47.100]   Yeah.
[00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.980]   But then he comes back, you know, and then you don't want to stay on the boat for your
[00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:50.980]   whole entire life.
[00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:51.980]   Oh yeah.
[00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:52.980]   Yeah.
[00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:53.980]   Yeah.
[00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:54.980]   But like how many squids you want to catch.
[00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:56.900]   Let's see, like in that case, that's more like he does adventures for his articles.
[00:12:56.900 --> 00:13:01.780]   Then goes back, goes back to his normal life where the deep life you got to, you want,
[00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:02.780]   I mean, that is a deep life.
[00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:04.180]   He's probably always working on something.
[00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:06.380]   So probably that's weird that he's going to do after that.
[00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:11.540]   Well, his book, he wrote a book, um, the something summer moon.
[00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:15.860]   It's something summer moon about this murder on an Indian reservation around trying to
[00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:17.100]   get oil rights or whatever.
[00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:20.300]   Anyway, Scorsese is making a movie out of it right now.
[00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:22.340]   So, you know, kudos to him.
[00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:23.340]   That's a really cool book.
[00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:25.740]   And I feel bad I'm getting the name.
[00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:33.180]   It's something, something, something moon.
[00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:39.260]   The problem is not that the not mix it up with, uh, well, no, but that might be the
[00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:40.940]   killers of the flower moon.
[00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:41.940]   Yeah.
[00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:42.940]   Yeah.
[00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:44.900]   See, the issue is there's the empire of the summer moon.
[00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:48.740]   That's the, the Gwyn book about the Comanches, right?
[00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:49.740]   Killers of the flower moon.
[00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:50.740]   Yeah.
[00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:51.740]   Killers of the flower moon.
[00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:52.740]   I have that.
[00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:53.740]   I should read that.
[00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:55.540]   But, but no, but David Graham lives a deep life.
[00:13:55.540 --> 00:14:01.500]   Not that the squid hunt is a deep life, but I probably a life where you do adventure journalism.
[00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:02.500]   Like that's interesting, right?
[00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:06.100]   Like it's a lot of these full-time writers, their lives are interesting.
[00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:07.500]   Like they're, they're unusual.
[00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:11.820]   They, in his case, like he travels and goes, he's adventures and comes back and writes
[00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:13.860]   on them and he kind of does it on his own terms.
[00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:15.660]   Like that's probably, that's pretty cool.
[00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:19.900]   Or you have like the Sebastian Youngers of the world where he goes to his, with his family
[00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:23.460]   to their little house in the pine scrub in Truro, Cape Cod.
[00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:28.500]   And he's sort of like chainsaws trees and writes, you know, it goes to a boxing gym
[00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:29.500]   too.
[00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:30.500]   Yeah.
[00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:31.500]   Yeah.
[00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:32.500]   Yeah.
[00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:36.380]   And then there's another guy who's older than us who, yeah, looks like he could beat me
[00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:36.600]   up.
