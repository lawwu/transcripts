[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.880]   A question comes in from podcast listener Peter.
[00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.760]   "Pastor John, being created in the image of God, many non-Christians have moral instincts
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:18.260]   on issues such as homosexuality and gender identity that reflect Christian morals.
[00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.680]   They can express that homosexuality is wrong, for example, but not that it's wrong because
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.340]   it contradicts God's created design.
[00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.400]   So is it possible to partner with non-Christians in the public fight over moral issues?"
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.400]   It's interesting.
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.800]   I was just asked a question almost like this yesterday when I was over Bethlehem College
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.960]   and Seminary by a seminary student.
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:48.480]   So I had just been thinking about it and so my answer is informed by that conversation.
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.600]   And it seems to me that I should summarize it something.
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.600]   It's a massive issue.
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.160]   I mean, you could write whole books on this issue.
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:01.520]   So I'm going to put my answer in two yes buts.
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.080]   So yes but, yes but.
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.240]   Okay, first yes but.
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:13.120]   So yes, Christians in society should care about the advancement of laws and policies
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:22.080]   and behaviors that do good to people and put restraints on destructive immoral behaviors.
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:30.560]   And of course, there are great complex issues as to what morality can be legislated.
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.280]   Like don't murder.
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.000]   Everybody agrees that moral conviction should be legislated.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.280]   Well, what about the moral conviction don't covet, don't lust?
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.000]   Well, no, probably not.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.520]   And a whole array in between.
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.560]   You can't make a crime out of coveting, but you can out of murder.
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.480]   And who knows what all criteria need to go into thinking through that.
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:03.880]   But what I'm saying is, yes, it is right and good to pursue obedience to Galatians 610,
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:13.560]   which says, "So then, as we have opportunity, let us do good to everyone, especially those
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.000]   of the household of faith."
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.640]   Doing good to everyone would include encouraging lots of people not to kill unborn babies and
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.040]   putting restraints upon people who think they should kill unborn babies, just like we put
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.320]   restraints on people who kill born babies.
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.240]   It would include, I mean, caring about doing good for everyone would include not saddling
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:42.160]   the next generation with unbearable debt by selfish spending in this generation with a
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.120]   "Go to hell as far as I'm concerned, you know, 30, 40 years from now.
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.120]   I don't care.
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.120]   I'm getting what I want.
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.120]   That's sinful."
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.640]   Christians ought to speak against those kinds of attitudes and policies.
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.440]   Another example would be to do good to everybody would surely be to put restraint on abuses
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:09.400]   of power and wealth and influence, police issues and military issues and rich, white-collar
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.320]   crime issues.
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.520]   Christians ought to care about the oppression and abuses that come from the misuse of power.
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.600]   We should be talking about that, so we should care.
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.360]   Yes, so that's my yes.
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:28.200]   Yes, we should obey Galatians 6:10 and try to publicly do good for everybody, but—so
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:37.960]   here's my first but—in your public involvement, don't conceal the roots of your convictions
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.320]   about what's right and wrong.
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:46.840]   Don't try to get a better hearing through downplaying your dependence on Christ and
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.020]   his Word and the gospel.
[00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:57.160]   This is where many Christians, it seems to me, lose their saltiness and their light.
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:05.200]   Advocating for behaviors that are Christian is not the light of the world.
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.280]   Advocating for restraining behaviors is not the light of the world.
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.760]   There's nothing gospel in it.
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:21.800]   The light of the world is Christ and all that God is for us in him, all his gospel and all
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.280]   his promises.
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:31.720]   If Christians become practical atheists in public by simply advocating for behaviors
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:39.560]   that correspond to Christian ethics, they may see a little more political acceptance
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:45.120]   and affirmation in the short run, but they will lose the larger battle for the eternal
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.720]   good.
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:53.400]   Do we really want to invest in a society whose outward behaviors are moral while everybody
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.400]   goes to hell?
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.400]   Let's call that love.
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.760]   Well, a lot of people would call it love.
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:57.760]   It isn't.
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:04.200]   So there's my first yes, do good to everybody, but don't put your light under a bushel to
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.680]   get a hearing.
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:15.020]   Second, yes, we may partner with—in fact, I think we inevitably must partner with unbelievers
[00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:23.880]   wherever the external behavior we are advocating or restraining overlaps with their convictions
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.040]   about that external behavior.
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:33.080]   The reason I focus on external behavior is because as a Christian, I will always desire
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:42.680]   and pray that people do the right thing out of faith in Jesus, not just because it's
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.920]   legal or illegal.
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.120]   Who cares about that in the long run?
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:53.320]   If they don't do it because they're a Christian, they go to hell, and I've done a not very
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.640]   good thing for them.
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:06:02.680]   So yes, partner with unbelievers in the pursuit of behaviors, policies, laws that you think
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.920]   are good for everybody.
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:08.320]   Here's my last but.
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:15.680]   But there are some associations with unbelievers that would be damaging and unadvisable.
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:24.220]   The principle, I think, of associating with unbelievers in any project would be we may
[00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:33.720]   partner with unbelievers in ways that do not compromise our beliefs or do not send the
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:40.120]   message to others that our beliefs in Christ are negligible.
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:49.640]   So for example, you might march in a pro-life demonstration alongside a Muslim because—I
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:07:03.280]   would—because no one would seriously see that as an undermining of his or your faith
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:10.440]   and salvation or whatever you believe, because the conviction that you shouldn't kill unborn
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:16.120]   babies doesn't have a necessary attachment to one or the other, so that it looks like
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:20.160]   somebody's sacrificing his beliefs to march in this demonstration.
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:28.120]   However, would you—I wouldn't—join in a prayer meeting, a public prayer gathering,
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:33.240]   where everybody is assuming—and it's been publicly stated—we're all praying to the
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.240]   same God.
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:40.080]   Buddhists and Muslims and Jews and Christians, we're all praying to the same God, and it
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:45.000]   doesn't matter whether you pray in Jesus' name or not, because he's going to hear this
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   generic God.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.080]   I wouldn't participate in that, because it is sending the message.
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.240]   It doesn't matter if you pray in Jesus' name.
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:55.400]   It doesn't matter if you believe that all gods are true gods.
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:58.520]   So summing up, yes but, yes but.
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:06.480]   Yes, publicly seek the good of all the people by advocating laws and policies and behaviors
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:14.960]   that do good to most people, the most people, and lessen harm and destruction, but don't
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:21.920]   silence the roots of your convictions and put Christ to naught and become a practical
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:29.260]   atheist in your public life as a simple public do-gooder rather than a prophetic witness
[00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.680]   to the King of Kings.
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:38.900]   And lastly, yes but, yes, partner with unbelievers in those processes, but not if it compromises
[00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:42.160]   your faith or gives the impression that Jesus is negligible.
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:44.120]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:48.140]   That is complicated indeed, but thank you for the excellent question, Peter.
[00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:54.280]   We're going to return tomorrow and look at one core reason why Jesus Christ was incarnate,
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:57.440]   why he had a body, why he wasn't fleshed.
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:00.480]   And it has to do with us, and it has to do with our redemption.
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:04.520]   John Piper will explain tomorrow as we linger over why Jesus had a body.
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:06.080]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.000]   I'll see you then.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:15.360]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.420]   you
