[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.760]   We resume our studies in Paul's epistle to the Romans, and incidentally we are meeting
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:20.320]   together to study this great epistle for the one hundredth time this evening. And we find
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:30.280]   ourselves now in chapter six, beginning a consideration of verses twelve, thirteen,
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.280]   and fourteen.
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.880]   "Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:45.200]   thereof; neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin, but
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:54.440]   yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead; and your members as instruments
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:01.240]   of righteousness unto God. For sin shall not have dominion over you; for ye are not under
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.040]   the law, but under grace."
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:13.960]   Now here, in beginning to look at this twelfth verse, we come, in a sense, to a new section,
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:21.040]   an itinerary to a new subsection of the argument which the apostle is dealing with in this
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:28.720]   sixth chapter. We come to the application, in a practical manner, of the argument that
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:35.880]   the apostle had been working out in the first eleven verses. Let us therefore not lose sight
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:43.400]   of the fact that he is still dealing with this false charge that is brought against
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:50.720]   his teaching, and which he has mentioned in the first verse. "Shall we continue in sin
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:57.920]   that grace may abound?" He is still refuting that, and showing how actually the effect
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:05.640]   of his teaching, when it is properly understood, is the exact opposite of that. Now he has
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:13.640]   been showing it in a purely doctrinal manner, and he proceeds at this stage to work it out
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:23.760]   along a more practical line. In verse twelve he puts this practical teaching in general.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:30.360]   In verse thirteen he puts it a little bit more in detail. And then, in verse fourteen,
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:38.240]   he again reminds us of the one great source of encouragement and of stimulus to us in
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:45.360]   our effort and endeavour to put into daily practice the great principles that he has
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:51.840]   been outlining. That is our analysis of this. You may remember that in starting with chapter
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.680]   six we analysed the whole of the chapter and showed that it was divided into two sections,
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.320]   the first section running from verse one to verse fourteen, and the second section, verse
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:08.240]   fifteen, to the end of the chapter. But that we could subdivide the first section into
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:14.200]   verses one to eleven, and then verses twelve, thirteen, and fourteen. And here we are now
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:21.000]   with this practical section where he is applying the great teaching. And you notice that he
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:29.320]   introduces it by this word "therefore." "Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:35.720]   body." There is, in a sense, no more important word in the writings of this apostle than
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:41.040]   the word "therefore." And if we have not learned to watch him when he uses the word
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:47.400]   "therefore," we are indeed very ignorant of his method. He had an essentially logical
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:54.360]   mind. He always builds up a case. He does not make statements at random. But he always
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:01.080]   proceeds from one thing to another, and his connecting link is generally this all-important
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:09.640]   word "therefore." "Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body."
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:16.920]   Very well then, let us look at some of the vitally important matters which he introduces
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:25.880]   in this particular instance by the use of the word "therefore." Here is the first.
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:34.200]   Doctrine is always something that is to be applied. It is never to be considered as something
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:42.400]   in and of itself. There is a statement, of course, that we could elaborate at great length
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:49.960]   very easily. Christian people can be divided into two main groups, speaking very generally.
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.960]   The commonest group, the largest group today, is the group that is not interested in doctrine
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:01.880]   at all. It is simply interested in practical matters. The second group, a much smaller
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:08.280]   one, is the group that is only interested in doctrine, and tends not to be interested
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:14.640]   at all in practical matters. Now, both, of course, are entirely wrong. I say that I am
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:21.200]   speaking generally. But what this word reminds us of this evening is this, that however much
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:26.080]   we may have been interested in the great argument and in the mighty doctrines that we have met
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:34.040]   in verses 1 to 11, they will be of no value to us at all unless we put them into practice.
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:41.040]   It is as dangerous to take a purely detached intellectual, theoretical, academic interest
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:48.840]   in doctrines and to stop at that as it is not to be interested in doctrine at all. Constantly
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:54.640]   we are warned in the Scriptures against both these extremes, but we are warned very especially
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:06:01.480]   about this. And if we do have a knowledge of doctrine, our responsibility is correspondingly
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:12.520]   greater. If, said our blessed Lord himself, if ye know these things, happy are ye if ye
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:17.880]   do them, it will be of no avail for us in the day of judgment to say that we understood
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:23.040]   all doctrine or had all knowledge, as the apostle puts it in the thirteenth chapter
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:31.240]   of 1 Corinthians, if it has not had a vital effect upon our whole life and conduct and
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.240]   behavior.
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:37.960]   Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body. There it is. Here I have been giving
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:46.200]   you all this great doctrine. He says, therefore, let us never lose sight of that. It is a terrible
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:52.440]   possibility, a dangerous possibility. What is there to some people that is more fascinating
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:58.040]   than Christian doctrine? It can become an intellectual hobby. It can be something that
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:05.840]   can delight the mind without touching the practice and the conduct. That is, according
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:13.040]   to the apostle, the most direct way to bring his great teaching into disrepute, because
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:18.280]   it plays into the hands of this very enemy whom he is refuting, the man who says, "It
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:22.920]   doesn't matter very much what we do now that we are Christians, as long as we are under
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:26.120]   the law." So there is our first deduction.
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:36.680]   The second is this. As this practical section is the outcome of and the deduction from what
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:43.480]   has gone before, what is stated in this practical section therefore becomes a very valuable
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:51.400]   check on our interpretation of the previous section. I think that follows of necessity,
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:58.400]   doesn't it? This we are going to look at now is the outcome of that in verses 1 to
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:06.200]   11. Very well. What we find here must correspond to what we said there. And very often it does
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:11.760]   emerge that a consideration of the practical section indicates perhaps a defect in our
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:17.800]   exposition of the more theoretical section. If we find that, it means that we were wrong
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:23.800]   in our interpretation of the theoretical section. The two things must go together, they must
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:30.320]   correspond, and they must work in the same direction. And therefore we shall see, as
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:40.520]   we proceed, that our previous interpretation was correct when we rejected totally any exposition
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:48.560]   of the first eleven verses which would teach sinless perfection, or say that a Christian
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:57.200]   can ever be in a position in which he has nothing whatsoever to do with sin. Now that
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:02.560]   needs modification and we shall proceed to give it. But at any rate, I say, we have seen
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:08.520]   enough already by the mere statement of the verse to see that sinless perfection has not
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:16.840]   been taught in verses 1 to 11. But let me go on to a third principle, which is this.
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:25.440]   What does this section tell us about ourselves as Christians in our relationship to sin?
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:30.520]   Now that's the important matter. We've already been looking at that, of course, in the first
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:38.080]   section, verses 1 to 11. But here again it is put in a very explicit and in a very plain
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:44.760]   manner. And this, as I've been saying, will help us to see whether or not our interpretation
[00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:52.080]   has already been right. You'll notice, therefore, that the Apostle seems to draw a distinction
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:10:05.560]   here between us and our mortal body. He says, "Let not sin, therefore, reign in your mortal
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:13.920]   body." You and your mortal body. There is a distinction, clearly, between these two
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:19.280]   things. I'm going to emphasize in a moment that he does not say, "Let not sin reign in
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:25.640]   you." What he says is, "Let not sin reign in your mortal body." Very well. Now that
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:30.400]   reminds us of something that we've already seen. We were considering verse 6, knowing
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:37.120]   this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:43.400]   henceforth we should not serve sin. Now then, we are coming back to that notion. And you
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:51.360]   remember that we interpreted the body of sin as meaning sin as it remains in our bodies,
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:58.240]   as distinct from us ourselves as personalities and as beings. And here it is once more. "Let
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:06.200]   not sin, therefore, reign in your mortal body." We must again look at the terms. "Body" really
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:15.680]   means what it says. It means literally, our physical body. It does not mean our sinful
[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:23.240]   nature. Now even the great John Calvin went astray at that point and interprets it as
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:30.480]   sinful nature. You see, but it doesn't mean that the apostle really is talking about the
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:39.120]   body, not about ourselves. Because he says "mortal body." And that in itself is sufficient
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:46.320]   to prove that he really does mean the physical, the literal physical body. He doesn't mean
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:53.920]   our total personality, for that is not mortal. He means this body of ours, flesh and bones
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:12:01.440]   and blood, what we normally mean when we use the term "body." And what he says is that
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:09.440]   sin, he says you mustn't let sin reign in your body. But then he adds this word "mortal,"
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:16.560]   this adjective. What does he mean by this? Why does he call it "your mortal body?" And
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:21.840]   surely as we've already seen in the previous exposition, there is very great significance
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:28.880]   in the use of this term. I think he means two things by it. One thing I think he means
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:36.280]   is that it's a dying body, and he says that to encourage us. You see, the teaching can
[00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:41.960]   be put like this, that the position we are in as Christians is only a temporary one.
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:47.760]   We ourselves have been saved, yes, but we are still in this life and in this world,
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:50.920]   and sin is still left in the body, yes, but it's not going to be forever, he says, it's
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:56.880]   only mortal. Your body is only mortal. You haven't got to face this for all eternity.
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:03.280]   No, no, this is only something temporary. This is only going to be our position and
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:10.640]   our condition as long as we are in these mortal bodies, and no longer. And that's a very
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:18.360]   comforting thought, is it not, in and of itself. But I think he also has a second meaning here.
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:28.160]   And it's this. He is contrasting the mortal body with the body of our glorification that
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:34.600]   is to come. Now, take for instance the perfect expression of this which you have in the Epistle
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:41.120]   to the Philippians, chapter 3 and verse 20. He says, "Our citizenship is in heaven, from
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:51.960]   whence also we look for and expect the Saviour, who shall change this our vile body, that
[00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:58.480]   it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to that mighty working whereby
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:04.880]   he is able even to subdue all things unto himself." Now, there's the contrast. This,
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:13.520]   our vile body, or this, the body of our humiliation. Or, if you like, this, our mortal body. And
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:19.560]   he will fashion it like unto his glorious body, or if you like, the body of his glorification.
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:27.880]   Now, that, I believe, is the very contrast that we've got here. The mortal body is to
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:34.720]   be contrasted with the glorified body. Again, you see, carrying this notion that as long
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:41.760]   as we are in this mortal body, we shall be bothered by sin. But there is a day coming
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:47.880]   when we shall not be bothered by sin in any respect at all. We ourselves are already delivered
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:52.040]   out of its territory and its realm. It still remains in the body. Yes, but there's a day
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:59.880]   coming when the body will be glorified and sin will be altogether finished with and left
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:07.800]   behind once and forever. The mortal body. And you notice that in all the teaching concerning
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:17.360]   the body in the Scriptures, mortality and corruption are always linked together. Take,
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:25.960]   for instance, 1 Corinthians 15, round about verses 50 to 54. And the apostle argues at
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:31.520]   great length saying, "Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, neither does corruption
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:37.800]   inherit incorruption." That is why he says that those who will be left alive on the earth
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:44.680]   when the Lord returns shall be changed. And they must be changed. They cannot inherit
[00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:51.520]   incorruption while they're in a corruptible body. This mortal, he says, shall put on immortality,
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:16:00.160]   and this corrupt shall put on incorruption. In other words, mortality and corruption always
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:08.880]   go together. So that what the apostle is teaching here perfectly plainly is that while we are
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:19.520]   in this mortal body, sin will remain in the body. And his whole appeal, therefore, is
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:25.360]   that we are not to allow it to reign in our mortal body. So let us put it positively like
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:34.760]   this. You notice that he does not say that sin must not reign in us. No, no. He can't
[00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:41.840]   say that, because he has already told us that our old man has indeed been crucified with
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:50.600]   Christ, that he is already dead to sin. It is impossible that sin should reign in us,
[00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:56.040]   but what is possible is that sin should reign in our mortal body. And the apostle tells
[00:16:56.040 --> 00:17:03.000]   us that sin must not be allowed to reign in our mortal body. So that when he uses a phrase
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.760]   like this, he's doing so very deliberately. He cannot, after all, he's been arguing in
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:13.400]   verses 1 and 11, turn to us suddenly and say, "Well, therefore, in the light of all this,
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:19.520]   let not sin reign in you." Oh, no. And he doesn't say that. He says, "Let not sin, therefore,
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:28.000]   reign in your mortal body." You yourself have already finished with it. Dead indeed unto
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:35.560]   sin. Christ died unto sin once. Reckon you also likewise to be dead indeed unto sin,
[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:41.680]   but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord. Don't go back on that. And the apostle
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:50.080]   doesn't go back on it. So he says, "Let not sin, therefore, reign in your mortal body."
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:58.480]   Very well. There are certain obvious implications to this teaching which arise at once. Let
[00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:03.600]   me just pull them out as principles so that we may have this clearly in our minds. The
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:14.760]   first is, as I've already been saying, sin still remains and is left in our bodies. Not
[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:25.440]   in us, but in our bodies. We, as such, have already finished with it. But the body hasn't.
[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:34.840]   This body of sin, this body which sin still inhabits and which it tries to use, there
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:44.520]   is the first principle. Sin still remains and is left in our bodies. Secondly, sin not
[00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:52.320]   only remains in our bodies, but if it isn't checked, if it isn't kept down, if it isn't
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:19:00.800]   kept in order, it will even reign in our bodies and it will even dominate over our bodies.
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:08.000]   Now we must be perfectly clear about this teaching. Not in me, but in my body. So the
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:14.680]   apostle tells us that sin, while we are left in this mortal body, will be always seeking
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:21.120]   to dominate our bodies and to dominate us through the body. The way in which he does
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:25.960]   so, he says, is this, "Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:32.760]   obey it in the lusts thereof." Now what does he mean by that? Well, that's exactly
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:38.880]   what sin does, of course. What sin does is to turn the natural instincts of the body
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:45.440]   into lusts. The instincts are perfectly all right. We must be clear about that. There's
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:51.960]   nothing sinful in the natural instincts. Ah, but sin tries to turn the natural instincts
[00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:58.360]   into inordinate affections, into lusts. And what he is asserting here is that while we
[00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:04.600]   are left in this mortal body, that sin will go on doing that. And it will try to trap
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:09.840]   us, it will try to dominate over the body, and we mustn't allow it to do that. All
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:17.240]   along it will be trying to do that, but we must restrain it, we must resist it, we must
[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:26.280]   fight it. Therefore, there is nothing which is more fatal in exposition, nothing which
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:33.920]   is quite so wrong as an interpretation of verse 11, as to regard it as something which
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:40.840]   says this to us, and it has often been put like this. We are told that verse 11 means
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:47.560]   that we are to reckon that sin is dead to us. But that is the exact opposite of what
[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:53.640]   the apostle is saying. He never says that sin is dead. What he does say is that we are
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:58.520]   dead to sin. He doesn't say that sin is dead. Indeed, he says the opposite. He says
[00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:02.880]   sin is not only dead, it's still in your mortal body. And if you don't realize that
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:11.320]   and deal with it, it will reign in your mortal body. His whole appeal insists upon that interpretation.
[00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:19.600]   Sin isn't dead. Sin is very much alive. Sin is not eradicated out of us, and it never
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:27.520]   will be, as long as we are in this mortal body. We must hold on to this word "mortal"
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:33.360]   because it is synonymous almost with corrupt. And here it is in our bodies, and it's always
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:40.360]   striving for mastery and for control in the Christian, in the believer. It can never dominate
[00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:45.360]   over him again, but it's always trying to dominate his body, and it may dominate his
[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:51.200]   body. And when it does, that is what we call backsliding. And it is only the believer,
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:55.440]   the true Christian, who is capable of backsliding.
[00:21:55.440 --> 00:22:00.040]   Very well then, here are some of the implications of this extraordinary statement, "Let not
[00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:08.160]   sin therefore reign in your mortal body." It's there, it will always be trying to control
[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:15.600]   and master and reign, and you've always got to remember that. Now, it is because of
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:24.520]   this truth that we have so many statements in the Scripture about this body of ours and
[00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:30.160]   our relationship to it, and the relationship of sin to it. For instance, we shall see in
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:36.000]   verse 19 in this chapter, he puts it like this, "I speak after the manner of men because
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:43.320]   of the infirmity of your flesh. For as ye have yielded your members, members meaning
[00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:50.920]   parts of the body, servants to uncleanness and to iniquity and to iniquity, even so now
[00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:58.680]   yield your members, servants to righteousness and to holiness." There it is again. And
[00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:04.200]   of course, when we get to chapter 7, it will be still more plain. Take verse 18, "I
[00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:10.760]   know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing." Or take it, if you like,
[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:19.760]   in verse 20, "Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:27.640]   in me." Or take it in verse 23, "But I see another law in my members, warring against
[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:36.480]   the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members."
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:43.160]   Always you see in the body. And so verse 24, "O wretched men that I am, who shall deliver
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:50.680]   me from the body of this death." All those statements are in line with this statement
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:56.400]   in the twelfth verse. And you remember I have indicated several times that you have got
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:04.160]   the same thing in chapter 8, in verse 23, "And not only they, but ourselves also, which
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:13.000]   have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves grown within ourselves, waiting
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our bodies." And it means literal physical
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:27.200]   body. That is the waiting for the glorification of the body. You will get exactly the same
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:32.640]   thing in chapter 12, in verse 1, "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:40.080]   God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:46.960]   is your reasonable service." You will find the same teaching exactly in 1 Corinthians
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:55.440]   6, 13, in 1 Corinthians 9, 27, where he says, "I keep under my body." And he means his
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:25:01.280]   body physically. "I keep under my body, lest having preached to others, I myself should
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:07.920]   be a cast away." He says, "I buffet my body. I hit, I bruise my body. I pummel my
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:16.280]   body. I keep under my body, because that is the place in which sin is still resident,
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:24.400]   not in me, but in my body. Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body."
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:31.440]   Now, this is in many ways the whole key to the understanding of this teaching, as it
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:38.040]   is the key to the understanding of the whole doctrine of sanctification. And it is because
[00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:44.520]   this has not become clear to people that there is so much confusion over this question of
[00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:49.800]   sanctification, and especially in this sixth chapter of the epistle to the Romans. Is it
[00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:56.760]   clear then? "I myself am dead indeed unto sin. I have nothing more to do with it, and
[00:25:56.760 --> 00:26:05.280]   it has nothing more to do with me. I have finished with it as such, I myself. But it
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:15.080]   is here still in my body. It is in my mortal body, and it will worry me, and I shall have
[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:21.760]   to deal with it, as long as I am in the mortal body. Thank God I know the whole time that
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:27.520]   it can never get me back under its dominion. Never again can it master me. Never again
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:34.160]   can it ruin my soul. Impossible. All it can do is to worry me in the body. It cannot affect
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:41.120]   my salvation. It cannot affect my final destiny. No, no, sin shall not have dominion over you.
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:47.520]   Reckon yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, and alive unto God. Yes, but in the meantime
[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:52.760]   it will go on worrying you. Don't let it master you, he says. Don't let it reign over your
[00:26:52.760 --> 00:27:00.960]   mortal body." And therefore my third deduction is this, that it need not do so. His very
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:08.800]   exhortation to us not to allow it to do so means that it need not happen of necessity.
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:16.120]   Very well. There then we finish our third great principle, which was that this verse
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:24.720]   tells us all about ourselves as Christians in our relationship to sin. And now therefore
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:33.960]   we can come on to the fourth main principle, which is this. The word therefore introduces
[00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:42.720]   us to the New Testament doctrine of holiness and of sanctification. Here it brings us,
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:49.120]   as I say, face to face with the New Testament, which is therefore the only scriptural teaching
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:56.720]   concerning holiness and sanctification. And this is clearly and obviously a very crucial
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:28:05.200]   matter. What does it tell us? Let me again extract the principles. Here is our verse,
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:15.080]   "Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:21.080]   thereof." What is the first principle in the New Testament doctrine of sanctification?
[00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:29.640]   It is obviously this, that this is something that you and I have to do. It is an exhortation
[00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:37.440]   that is addressed to us. "Let not, don't allow sin to reign in your mortal body."
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:46.880]   From which I deduce this, that sanctification is not a gift to be received. And this can
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:54.200]   never be stated too frequently. Sanctification is not a gift to be received. There are so
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:59.080]   many who teach that. They say, "You've received your justification already by faith,
[00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:04.160]   now then, come along and receive your sanctification by faith." But sanctification is not a gift
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:12.520]   to be received. Here we are face to face with an exhortation. Secondly, sanctification is
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:20.000]   not a sudden experience of deliverance once and forever. It cannot be, because sin is
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:26.600]   going to remain in the body as long as it is mortal. And as long as sin remains in my
[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:32.440]   body, I shall never have an experience of a sudden deliverance once and forever from
[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:38.240]   sin. I know large numbers of Christian people who spend a life of misery because they are
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:42.000]   seeking that. They believe it is possible, they have been taught that it is possible,
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:48.520]   that in one act they can be entirely rid of sin, finally and completely. And they are
[00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:52.560]   seeking it, they are longing for it, trying to get it, and they never seem to get it.
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:56.160]   And they feel discouraged. And some of them even wonder whether they are Christians at
[00:29:56.160 --> 00:30:02.440]   all. It is entirely because they have not understood this chapter. Sin remains in the
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:08.640]   mortal body, and will remain in the body as long as it is mortal. And therefore we shall
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:14.680]   never be rid from it in that sense. It will go on worrying, and we have always got this
[00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:22.320]   fight. There is no such thing as a sudden experience of complete deliverance from sin
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:27.920]   once and forever. Again, I would say that the New Testament
[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:37.080]   method of teaching sanctification and holiness is not a constant appeal to us to surrender.
[00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:42.680]   You are familiar with that teaching. We are always being told and appealed to to surrender
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:48.440]   and to be willing to be made willing. You are familiar with the phrase, aren't you?
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:54.040]   They say, are you willing to be delivered from sin and to be kept in a sanctified and
[00:30:54.040 --> 00:31:00.040]   holy state? Well, I am not sure. They say, well, then are you willing to be made willing?
[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:05.040]   And you are asked to surrender in order that you may be made willing to be made willing.
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:12.720]   But that is not the teaching here. No, or again, let me give you another negative.
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:19.160]   The New Testament teaching about sanctification is not just an appeal to us to look to the
[00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:27.280]   Lord. Or, as it is sometimes put, allow him to live his life in you. They say, that is
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:31.200]   your trouble. You are struggling. You are fighting against sin. And of course you are
[00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:35.080]   defeated and that is why you go wrong. They say, but you are so wrong in all that you
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:40.200]   have got nothing to do but to surrender and to look to the Lord. Allow him to live his
[00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:44.600]   life in you and he will give you victory and he will keep you victorious and you will have
[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:52.120]   no more trouble. Isn't that the teaching? The prevailing, the common teaching.
[00:31:52.120 --> 00:32:00.320]   Well all I ask is this, how do you reconcile that teaching with this? Let not sin therefore
[00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:07.080]   reign in your mortal body. That is addressed to you. That is addressed to me. Don't allow
[00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:15.000]   sin to reign in your mortal body. That is the exhortation. It is an admonition. Isn't
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:24.360]   it clear that all this other teaching is unscriptural? It bypasses these scriptures. Indeed, it ignores
[00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:32.080]   this scriptural teaching. It makes the second half of most of these epistles entirely unnecessary
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:36.200]   because it tells us you have got nothing else to do but just to realize that you must stop
[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:40.520]   struggling. You must allow the Lord to live his victorious life in you and all will be
[00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:45.880]   well. But here we are given these practical exhortations and we shall go on to find him
[00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:50.720]   putting it in actual detail as he does in other epistles. He tells the Ephesians not
[00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:56.600]   to steal anymore, not to use foolish talking and jesting, not to lie to one another. He
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:33:02.360]   is telling them not to do it. And yet this other teaching dismisses all that and says
[00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:07.400]   we have got nothing to do but to be made willing to be made willing and to allow the Lord to
[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:15.840]   live his life in us and all is well. But this is addressed to us. And obviously it is addressed
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:24.080]   to us because of the doctrine which he has been elaborating in the first eleven verses.
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:31.440]   Very well then, what is the teaching? Well, it is, I say, a direct exhortation and admonition
[00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:41.640]   urging upon us not to allow sin to reign in our mortal bodies. But how do you reconcile
[00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:47.640]   all that, says someone, with what you have been telling us in the previous verses? That
[00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:55.240]   because we are under grace and not under law and not under the power of sin, that our sanctification
[00:33:55.240 --> 00:34:01.200]   is absolutely guaranteed that God is going to do it. Verse fourteen repeats it. Sin shall
[00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:06.160]   not have dominion over you. Why? Well, because you are not under the law but are under grace.
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:10.640]   Grace is working this. You have been emphasizing that. How do you reconcile that with what
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:17.320]   you are saying now? Well, it seems to me the reconciliation is quite simple. God does this
[00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:25.800]   in us, through us. This is his way of doing it. Go again to Philippians 2 verses 12 and
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:33.240]   13. Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling for, because it is God that
[00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:39.000]   worketh in you both to will and to do. Of course it is God's work, but this is God's
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:44.200]   way of doing it. God doesn't do it by telling us to do nothing and just to look to the Lord.
[00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:51.200]   Oh no, God tells us to do it in this way. Now this is the New Testament method of sanctification.
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:58.440]   Well, what is it? Well, here it is, my second principle. It is something that we have to
[00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:09.200]   do by drawing deductions from the doctrine we have already considered. Let not sin therefore
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:14.400]   reign in your mortal bodies. Now this is what we have got to do. We have got to use this
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:18.880]   therefore. We have got to make certain deductions. We have got to see that certain things are
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:26.160]   inevitable from the doctrine that he has already been laying down. So that I come in my third
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:36.280]   principle to the actual practical details. Do you long to be holy? Do you long to have
[00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:43.640]   victory over sin in your mortal body? How do you do it? This is how you do it. First,
[00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:49.520]   understand the doctrine. You cannot work out the therefore unless you are clear about the
[00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:55.640]   doctrine. Have you really understood verses 1 to 11? Have you understood what it means
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:36:02.960]   by saying that you cannot continue in sin that grace may abound because you are already
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:11.800]   dead to sin? Have you understood that your old man has been crucified with Christ? Do
[00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:18.760]   you know what it means to reckon yourself to be dead indeed unto sin as Christ is dead
[00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:24.840]   unto sin? Understand the doctrine. That is the place to start. You do not say, "I am
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:29.240]   not interested in doctrine. All I do is to look to Christ and allow him to live his life."
[00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:35.600]   No. You must understand the doctrine. Then, having understood it, you must remind yourselves
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:43.320]   of it constantly. Reckon. Go on reckoning. Keep on reckoning. Realize it. Apply it to
[00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:54.320]   yourself. Then, draw the inevitable deductions from it. What are they? Here are some of them.
[00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:59.400]   If I really understand and believe that doctrine and realize what it is saying, I am bound
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:08.280]   to draw this deduction. What sort of a person ought I to be in the light of this doctrine?
[00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:14.000]   You cannot consider the doctrine truly without drawing that deduction. Here is the truth
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:21.080]   about me that I have died with Christ. Why have I died with Christ? You are bound to
[00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:25.200]   ask the question, if you really understand the doctrine. You say, "What is my position
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:31.280]   now? What sort of a man ought I to be in the light of this that has happened to me?"
[00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:36.680]   Immediately you are dealing with your sanctification. You are beginning to turn against sin as it
[00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:44.280]   resides in your mortal body. In the same way, the doctrine provides us with the true motives
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:54.000]   for holiness. What are the true motives for holiness? They are not just the evil of sin.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:59.480]   They are not just that we should be happy. That comes in, but it is not the great motive.
[00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:05.280]   Still less should we be holy in order to make ourselves Christians. Still less should we
[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:11.400]   be holy merely because we are afraid of hell and the punishment of hell. No, no. Our motives
[00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:20.160]   are entirely positive. Why must I not allow sin to reign in my mortal body? Well, because
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:27.960]   I am a man who claims to know what God's purpose is for me. What is God's purpose for me? Well,
[00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:34.560]   God's purpose for me is this, that all the works of the devil shall be undone in me.
[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:39.520]   God made me in his own image. He made me perfect. His whole purpose in salvation is to bring
[00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:45.360]   me back to that. I believe that. I know that. I realize that. Well, if I do, I cannot allow
[00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:52.240]   sin to reign in my mortal body. Here is my motive. I know what God's purpose for me is
[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:58.400]   and all he has planned and all he has brought to pass. There is my grand motive, but I have
[00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:08.240]   got another. I know what the Lord Jesus Christ has done for me. I, knowing this doctrine,
[00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:12.600]   believe that the second person in the blessed Holy Trinity left the courts of heaven and
[00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:18.320]   came into this world and not only lived as a man, but humbled himself. He came in the
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:24.120]   likeness of sinful flesh. I believe that he went to Calvary and bore my sins in his own
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:30.560]   body on the tree and suffered the agony and the indignity of it all for me. Why did he
[00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:37.800]   do it? That I might continue in sin? No, that he might separate unto himself a peculiar
[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:44.320]   people zealous of good works, that he might redeem us from all iniquity. So how can I
[00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:49.360]   go on with it? These are the motives. This is the way that I become sanctified. It is
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:55.800]   because I know this that I will not allow sin to reign in my mortal body.
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:40:01.800]   And therefore, you see, I go on to draw this deduction. The very honor of God and of the
[00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:08.800]   Lord Jesus Christ is involved in this matter of my behavior. I claim to be a child of God.
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:17.520]   I claim to be one who has been adopted into the family of God. I am of the household of
[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:22.640]   God. I believe that the doctrine has taught me that. Very well, then, I say to myself,
[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:29.640]   "If I allow sin to reign in my mortal body, I am letting down my Father. I am letting
[00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:36.800]   down my Savior. I am letting down the family of heaven to which I belong. I cannot do that."
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:42.560]   This is how the New Testament sanctifies us. "Sanctify them through thy truth. Thy word
[00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:48.200]   is truth. It is the truth that sanctifies. He shall know the truth, and the truth shall
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:53.240]   make you free," said our Lord to the people. This is the truth that makes us free. It tells
[00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:58.640]   us who we are, what we are, what has been done for us, and how the whole honor of the
[00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:03.880]   family is, as it were, in our hands. It does not just say to me, "Let go and let God,
[00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:08.680]   or do nothing but allow him to live his life in you." No, no. Reason it out, it says.
[00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:15.680]   Work it out. Therefore, let not sin reign in your mortal body.
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:23.160]   It reminds me constantly of the wonderful position in which I am. I can say that sin
[00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:31.280]   shall never again have dominion over me. I can say that death can never again have dominion
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:36.200]   over me. It had dominion over me in Adam, but never again. I have been separated. I
[00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:43.200]   have been crucified with Christ. My old man is dead. I am already seated with Christ in
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:50.840]   the heavenly places. It is as I realize these things that I say, "Sin shall not reign in
[00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:58.600]   my mortal body." Or, if you like, you can argue like this, "If I allow sin to reign
[00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:04.480]   in my mortal body, then I am in an utterly contradictory position. I say I believe the
[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:09.560]   gospel, I believe in Christ, in order that I may be delivered, and that as a result of
[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:15.480]   my belief I am in this new position, and yet I go on living as if I were not in a new position.
[00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:22.480]   I am utterly contradictory. I am in an utterly foolish and untenable position." Not only
[00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:30.080]   that, if I allow sin to reign in my mortal body, it is a complete denial of everything
[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:38.520]   that I claim to be looking forward to. As a Christian who understands this doctrine,
[00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:44.400]   I say that I know that a day is coming when Christ shall have conquered every enemy, shall
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:51.400]   return to reign, my body shall be glorified, I shall be with him and like him. I say that
[00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:58.640]   on the one hand, and on the other hand, I am living the old life, as if I had never
[00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:03.840]   heard of these things at all, and as if I had not believed. These are the doctrines
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:09.400]   which we are told to apply. These are the deductions which we are meant to draw. But
[00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:16.400]   I have yet another one. Listen to this. "If I allow sin to reign in my mortal body, I
[00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:26.360]   am then setting myself against the purpose of God in me and in my salvation. And there
[00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:35.640]   is no more dangerous thing that a believer can ever do than that. This is the will of
[00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:42.640]   God, even your sanctification, and he is going to do it. We are under the reign of grace
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:49.080]   and nothing can stop it." I have been emphasizing that repeatedly in all the eleven verses.
[00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:55.360]   Very well. If I allow sin to reign in my mortal body, what am I doing? I am for the time being
[00:43:55.360 --> 00:44:01.600]   standing against the purpose of God in me. And what will happen? Well, I do not know
[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:06.600]   what may happen to me. What the apostle says to the members of the Church of Corinth is
[00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:13.600]   this. In 1 Corinthians 11, he says, "For this cause many are weak and sickly among
[00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:23.040]   you, and some sleep." There were Christian people who were allowing sin to reign in their
[00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:31.760]   mortal bodies, and that is what has happened to them, says Paul. Some of them are very
[00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:38.800]   ill, some of them are sick, and some of them have even died. "Yes," says the twelfth
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:45.200]   chapter of the epistle to the Hebrews, "whom the Lord loveth, he chasteneth." And if you
[00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:52.120]   are not enduring chastisement in any shape or form, you are not a son, you are a bastard.
[00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:59.120]   It is God's purpose to make us holy, and He is working in us. And if we stand against
[00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:04.840]   His purpose by allowing sin to reign in our mortal bodies, well then, I say, do not be
[00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:10.240]   surprised if you are chastised and chastised very severely. It may be illness, it may be
[00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:16.160]   accident, it may be death, it may be sorrow. God, if you belong to Him, is going to bring
[00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:23.080]   you there. And therefore a man who allows sin to reign in his mortal body is exposing
[00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:30.080]   himself to the chastisement of the love of God. And is there anything more foolish, more
[00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:38.680]   insane, more mad than that? These are some of the deductions that we draw.
[00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:45.080]   And the final thing I say is this. The very exhortation in the light of the doctrine that
[00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:52.080]   has preceded it reminds us of what is possible to us and possible for us. "Let not sin therefore
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:58.120]   reign in your mortal body." But wait a minute, says someone. Are not you putting me back
[00:45:58.120 --> 00:46:04.040]   in the position I was before I was a Christian? I am doing nothing of the sort. I am saying,
[00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:11.040]   "Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body." I know that there is nothing more futile
[00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:16.360]   than to turn to a natural man and to say, "Conquer sin, do not let it reign in your
[00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:21.760]   mortal body." He cannot do it. He is the slave of sin. He is under the dominion of
[00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:27.000]   sin. He is under the reign of sin. And he is a complete slave to it. It is useless to
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:32.720]   tell him not to let it reign. It will reign, it does reign. But I am not talking to him.
[00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:39.720]   I say, "Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body." Who are you? Who are you?
[00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:47.600]   Oh, you are the man who has died with Christ, who has been crucified with Christ. You are
[00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:53.400]   the man who is alive unto God. You are the man in whom the Spirit of God is working.
[00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:57.880]   You are the man in whom God's great purpose has been set moving. You have got the power
[00:46:57.880 --> 00:47:04.880]   in you. And therefore I can exhort you because you have got the power. Therefore, the doctrine
[00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:12.320]   has already told you that greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world. So
[00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:17.400]   you are not, you are left without any excuse at all. You are not left to battle with sin
[00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:22.920]   just in and of yourself because you are a child of God. The Spirit of God is in you.
[00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:29.920]   The mind of Christ is in you. The whole operation of God is working itself out in you. And it
[00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:36.760]   is because of this we are not told just to let go and let God, or to be passive and allow
[00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:42.760]   Christ to live His life in us. But instead, "Let not sin therefore" - don't you let sin
[00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:48.880]   therefore - "reign in your mortal body." You are in a position to stop it. Resist the devil
[00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:54.600]   and he will flee from you. You are adversaries of the devil as a roaring lion roams about
[00:47:54.600 --> 00:48:01.600]   seeking whom he may devour. Whom? Resist you. Resist him. Step first in the faith. And if
[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:11.280]   you do that, you will conquer him, you will defeat him. There is no need for sin to reign
[00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:18.280]   in our mortal bodies because God is working in us both to will and to do of His good pleasure.
[00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:29.640]   Still there is the introduction, as it were, to the New Testament doctrine of sanctification
[00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:36.640]   introduced by this important and vital word. Therefore, in the light of this glorious doctrine
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:47.600]   of verses 1 to 11, in the light of all that, "Let not" - don't allow - "sin to reign in
[00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:56.200]   your mortal body, that ye may obey it in the lusts thereof." Let us pray.
[00:48:56.200 --> 00:49:05.960]   O Lord, our God, we again come into Thy presence to thank Thee and to praise Thy name for this
[00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:14.760]   blessed truth. We thank Thee for the measure and the extent to which we can confirm in
[00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:22.160]   our own experiences the blessed word of Thy dear Son, our Lord and Savior, when He said,
[00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:29.160]   "If ye continue in my word, then shall ye be my disciples indeed, and ye shall know
[00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:36.600]   the truth, and the truth shall make you free." We thank Thee for the truth concerning ourselves
[00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:46.880]   in Christ that liberates us and sets us free and enables us to master and to keep in order
[00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:56.000]   the sin that still remains in our mortal body. We thank Thee, O Lord, for this blessed fact
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:05.600]   and possibility. We thank Thee that we can look forward likewise to the day which is
[00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:12.600]   coming when this body shall no longer be mortal and incorruptible, but immortal and incorruptible
[00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:24.160]   and glorified, even as the body of His glorification.
[00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:30.720]   Now may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God, and the fellowship and
[00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:37.720]   the communion of the Holy Spirit, abide and continue with us now this night and throughout
[00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:45.200]   the remainder of this hour's short, uncertain earthly life and pilgrimage in this mortal
[00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:52.240]   body, and until the day of the adoption shall come. Amen.
[00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:59.240]   We do hope that you have been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones. All of
