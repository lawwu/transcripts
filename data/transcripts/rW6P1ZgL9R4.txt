[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   I think The Witness is an absolutely extraordinary work of art.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.880]   So it's a game that has no text, at least no text that's relevant to the game elements.
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.160]   In kind of classic Myst style, you wake up on an island and figure out what's going on.
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:23.560]   And the game proceeds to explain to you, without using words, but just by shaping your environment,
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:32.680]   a series of extremely complex mechanics, basically, of a system that exists in this world.
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.920]   So you learn a bunch of stuff.
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.200]   And it gets to the point where it feels like you're in conversation with the game's designers.
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.840]   It's like, ah, he's asking me to do this here.
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.840]   No one's asking you, right?
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:47.840]   There's no text.
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.960]   But you can feel that you are being asked.
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:56.120]   And you perform some interaction in the environment, and you feel that you have answered.
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.040]   And the game responds in kind.
