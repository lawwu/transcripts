[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440]   I'd like to summarize my thoughts in three charts.
[00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.880]   And I call this, "This Time It's Not Different."
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.480]   Chart number one is a look at the components of U.S. GDP.
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.240]   This is from the Bureau of Economic Analysis.
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.720]   The components of GDP are surprisingly resilient
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.280]   and roughly the same over long stretches of time.
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.520]   So if that is true,
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.880]   what happens when you have any kind of a revolution?
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.640]   So let's look at the Industrial Revolution,
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.280]   the shift from farms to factories.
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.640]   And what you saw was in specific job classes,
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.640]   things just fall to zero.
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.680]   So this is what people are worried about.
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.240]   But if you remember the last chart,
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.440]   somehow we found a way to find growth.
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.600]   And this is what's demonstrated on this final chart,
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.400]   which is when you look at U.S. productivity
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.640]   and worker compensation,
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.520]   you find that every time we find a new way of innovating,
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.440]   compensation tends to track it.
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.680]   As productivity goes up, which is what AI should give us,
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:51.960]   compensation also goes up,
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.640]   which means new job classes will be created.
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.520]   It feels more personal right now
[00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.560]   because we're all living it,
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.560]   But I suspect that this time is not different.
