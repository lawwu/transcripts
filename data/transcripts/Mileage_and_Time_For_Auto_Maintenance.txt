[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.480]   Hello everybody, it's Sam and Cindy from the Financial Samurai podcast and this episode I want to talk about a small epiphany that I
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.840]   realized and that is the difference between
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.960]   time and
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.560]   Car mileage because I have a Land Rover Range Rover sport and whenever I say I have a Range Rover sport
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:26.980]   inevitably commenters or people be like, oh it must have a lot of maintenance issues and you know, why are you owning that car because
[00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.520]   Clearly, it's gonna break down at some point
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:36.400]   Well, I have owned a Land Rover SUV for about 20 years now before the Range Rover sport
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.080]   I owned a Land Rover Discovery 2 for how many years 10 years?
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:48.980]   It was a while and so for my Range Rover sport, it's a 2015 model I bought it end of
[00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:57.000]   2016 so we're talking about almost seven years of ownership and during this almost seven year time period
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.760]   I've had the fan break
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.920]   So I had to fix that that cost about 700 bucks
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.640]   That was three and a half years in and now my coolant is leaking and the coolant leaking
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.520]   Maybe it's like a water pump issue or something. I'm assuming that's gonna cost a thousand dollars to fix
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.580]   So that's not too bad because that was a three and a half year gap
[00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:20.800]   per issue
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:27.200]   Other than that is just change the tires change the brakes add the gas and the car has been very dependable for almost seven years
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.480]   But what I realized is that because I only drive
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.160]   5,500 miles a year
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:42.200]   I only have about 43,000 miles on the car and a commenter mentioned something really logical and he said well Sam
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.180]   Do you think it's because of your low mileage that you don't have as many problems and I thought to myself well
[00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.520]   Yeah, that's probably obviously true
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.160]   But it's been you know, seven years with this car and 13 years at the previous car and you know
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.160]   I expect problems to occur
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:04.560]   Every two three four years is not so bad in my opinion because every year or every two years you need to do a service change
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.200]   Anyway, so on my dashboard, it says I have to do a service in 700 miles
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.840]   So it's basically been a little over a year and the coolant leaked gonna fix the water pump. Okay fine
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.640]   I'm gonna fix it and I'm gonna change the oil
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:25.600]   Not a big deal because I had to go into the dealership or the auto mechanic anyway to get the car serviced
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:31.360]   However, here's something that sounds obvious now that I talk about it. It wasn't too obvious to me
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.600]   But if I had driven 14,000 miles a year
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:40.760]   My fan would have broken after a year and a half and then my coolant would have started leaking
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.040]   After about three years and if this was the scenario, I'd be thinking myself
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:53.560]   Hey, man Land Rover Ranger really is unreliable. Why are there these problems that occur so
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.000]   Quickly one after another so what's my point?
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.520]   I guess my point is I had a blind spot that I didn't really think about
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:09.200]   Until a reader commented on the miles and the second thing perhaps is if you want to buy a luxury car or a nicer car
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.040]   It's best that you're not a regular driver if you want to save money
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:21.160]   And if you do drive a lot a more expensive car, you should have a better warranty than the average car
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.560]   So hopefully it's not just three years 50,000 miles. Maybe it's four or five years
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.720]   70 80 100 thousand miles, but I don't know if that's available. And the other thing is
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:37.280]   Maybe you do want an extended warranty. Generally warranties are sold because they are highly profitable for
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.760]   the auto company
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.460]   However, if you're buying an expensive car
[00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:49.760]   These maintenance bills do add up. Here's something also interesting that I think is worth noting
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:56.380]   I remember when I had a car issue in my 20s or early 30s. I would feel a little bit more stressed out
[00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.720]   I was thinking myself man. How much is this gonna cost? How long is this gonna take?
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.220]   Well, I still think how long is this gonna take but I no longer think oh man
[00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:11.840]   How much is this gonna cost two thousand three thousand dollars because I'm older and wealthier now
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.800]   So if it costs I don't know two thousand dollars to fix the coolant leak and chase some parts
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.760]   So be it because not only can I afford it
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:28.480]   But it's also important vitally important for safety because I am the driver of my family. So I feel it's a duty
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.440]   It's a must to spend that money and not mess around
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:39.720]   So if you're younger and you're wondering hmm, why are these people these older people with family driving such nicer cars?
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:40.960]   Well one
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:46.920]   One of the reasons why is because of safety they want a larger vehicle that can hold their children and feel more secure just in
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:52.600]   Case someone else bashes them and then to frankly the affordability of cars as you age
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.120]   It gets easier and it seems obvious
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.940]   but it wasn't so obvious to me when I talked about the 1/10 rule for car buying trying to
[00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:07.840]   limit people to 1/10 of their income in terms of the purchase price of a car because I saw the car as
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:13.280]   Such an extravagant waste of money where that money could be spent
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:20.080]   Investing in the stock market a real estate market and so forth at almost 46 years old with two young children
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.040]   I think it's vital to have a safe car and
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.520]   There is a high correlation with a safe car and an expensive car
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.360]   So the focus on saving as much money as possible on a car as you get older
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.080]   Really diminishes I feel
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:41.560]   Completely different than I did in my 20s and 30s in terms of buying a nice car
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:48.280]   And I think naturally so will you so the next time you see a middle-aged guy driving a Porsche 911 or?
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.600]   I don't know a Ranger or whatever. I don't think it's a midlife crisis
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.080]   I just think it's kind of like well
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.800]   You can afford it now your net worths higher and you need a safe car to shut around your family
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.480]   So Sydney, what are your thoughts about driving a nice car?
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.920]   now that we have two kids because you've known me since I was driving a
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:15.240]   2000 a thousand five hundred dollar car in college. Yeah, and so what are your thoughts? Well, I've been really happy
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:23.840]   For the longest time I guess since kind of since the Land Rover started because the turnover of your autos
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.280]   Went way down right right and prior to that you were changing cars
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:33.440]   Almost every year year and a half. Yeah, I think I ate cars in 12 years and and
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:39.960]   You know, I wasn't doing that much driving anyway, but I just remember it was this constant like what what am I gonna get next?
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.960]   I'm gonna get next it's just this
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.200]   constant thing and now
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:49.560]   It's kind of like moving, you know, we're not moving or hopefully we won't be moving very much. We feel settled
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.440]   So it's like the same thing with the car
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:56.480]   You know, we've found a car that works well for our family that you are happy with
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:03.960]   Yeah that we feel is safe and reliable and we have other things to keep us busy and interested in right now
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:06.400]   That's a good point. I remember in my 20s
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:12.320]   I was infatuated with cars because I always want a nice car, but my parents never drove a nice car in the 1980s
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:17.160]   We had a 1976 Datsun with no paint and no hubcaps in high school
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:23.100]   We had a eight-year-old Toyota Camry and then finally I was able to get a car in college, which was
[00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:29.060]   Toyota FX 16 with just wrong shifting gears and that cost
[00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:33.040]   $1,600 and I was really like a junky car, but you know
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:42.240]   You know, I was just thrilled that you had a car period that we could get off campus right explore Jamestown
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:47.000]   Road trips and stuff. It was fun. We didn't need anything fancy. Yeah, and it's so funny as a guy
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:53.880]   I remember thinking oh, I need kind of like a respectable looking car to impress the ladies didn't matter to me
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:59.020]   I was just thrilled that we could drive somewhere. Yeah escape campus. That is true, right?
[00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:04.280]   So and then like in your 20s, let's say you got a nice job. So I got a good job in New York City
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:08.440]   so I bought a car in Manhattan, which was in retrospect so stupid and then I
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.040]   bought
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:16.360]   An m3 and actually many g500 all these cars in San Francisco in my 20s
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:19.000]   Oh a BMW 5 series
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.560]   yeah, but the BMW 5 series was sweet as black and then it had like the
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:29.620]   Protruding screen flat screen and a huge subwoofer. Do you remember that?
[00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:35.920]   Yeah, so I had the thrill of going on Craigslist
[00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:41.820]   bargaining hard getting a new car driving for a year year and a half and then trying to sell it for the same or
[00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:44.860]   A little bit of a profit. Yeah, you did very well with that, right?
[00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:48.700]   But this is the funny thing as you get older you're like I'm over that stuff
[00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:53.340]   Less time what a pain in the butt to negotiate
[00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:57.980]   DMV the pink slip meet people pay taxes
[00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:02.600]   And it's just so interesting the evolution of car ownership over time
[00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:06.740]   Because as you as you can afford to buy a more expensive car
[00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:11.480]   You kind of don't really care as much anymore like this
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:18.740]   Range Rover Sport is 2015. I want it. I want to own it until it's at least 10 years old provided that it's reliable
[00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:23.780]   And there's not a lot of problems because I know the car right? I know the maintenance history
[00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:26.100]   There's no, you know
[00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:32.660]   mysterious bugs that are hopefully gonna appear that we don't know about and that's kind of the same thing with
[00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:37.140]   Maybe upgrading to a house which we'll talk about in a new episode which I had written about
[00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:42.120]   There are some things that you might not expect whenever you trade something, you know
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:45.920]   For something you don't and I also think this car is very comfortable
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:51.160]   It drives well, like you it feels like a sturdy car when we've had that whole
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:54.020]   mess last year where we
[00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:59.060]   The valley damaged the car and then we had a flat tire and yada yada yada
[00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:05.680]   We had that rental car for two months and that it was a very different feeling car and I wasn't driving it
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:12.620]   But even as a passenger, yeah, just it was a very different feeling experience and it didn't feel as sturdy or stable
[00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:15.840]   It felt very like a boat top-heavy or something, right?
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:21.800]   It made me think about we watched a lot of the f1 reality show drive to survive
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:26.580]   I have to survive on Netflix when Daniel Ricardo like the last time he switched teams
[00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:33.140]   He just couldn't get in a groove with the new car. I forgot which racing team it was Aston Martin, maybe yeah
[00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:37.580]   But yeah, I was just like Renault. He went to Renault for a couple years the car and him
[00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:44.400]   They just didn't click well and it affected his performance where I feel like this car matches well with your driving
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:48.720]   I guess you just get familiar. Yeah any car just the way it drives way it feels
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:55.020]   So in that sense, I do believe the ideal length of time to own a car is about 10 years
[00:10:55.940 --> 00:11:01.160]   or maybe when the car is 10 years old and then start thinking about another car because think about it in
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:08.380]   10 years every single year these car engineers and designers are thinking about things to make the car better because
[00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:14.180]   In a capitalistic society you have to offer more and more for the money
[00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:17.380]   Otherwise, you're gonna lose market share to other auto
[00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:23.520]   Manufacturers and so that's the other thing when people always make fun of me for driving a Land Rover Range Rover
[00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:27.740]   I'm saying look if it is that unreliable these cars
[00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:34.540]   I wouldn't buy it because I value my time a lot and the company would go bankrupt or really tank in
[00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:40.820]   Value because other people wouldn't buy it. But the reality is the cars still sell very very well
[00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:45.180]   Alrighty, that's all I wanted to really share because it was just my realization
[00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:51.720]   Ah, the miles could accelerate the number of problems a car has in a shorter time frame
[00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:58.820]   Thereby changing your perception of various cars, but because we drive relatively low mileage
[00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:01.660]   5,000 to 5,500 a year
[00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:09.100]   These problems seem to be spread out in a more acceptable amount of time where I'm like, well every three years
[00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:15.100]   Whatever nothing lasts forever. All right, everyone if you enjoyed this episode, we'd love a positive five-star review

[00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:52.820]   Yl and finally I'm doing a lot more interviews with people who I think are interesting and they're gonna be about
[00:12:52.820 --> 00:13:00.060]   45 minute to an hour long interviews with authors and entrepreneurs and people work in big tech. So stay tuned
[00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:06.100]   I'm just trying to make it interesting mix it up because I finally figured out how to use the Riverside FM software
[00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:11.780]   to interview people and that's what I plan to do because there's nothing better actually than reading a good book and
[00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:17.420]   Then interviewing the author to find out what they're thinking because as an author myself
[00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:19.980]   I've been through a lot of these interviews as well
[00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:26.220]   And I just find it to be really insightful because I'm reading a lot more and I also love to understand
[00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:33.820]   How creators and entrepreneurs think so, hopefully you will appreciate these upcoming interviews as well. Take care. Bye
