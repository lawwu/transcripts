[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360]   The following is a conversation with Ray Dalio.
[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.120]   He's the founder, co-chairman,
[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.560]   and co-chief investment officer of Bridgewater Associates,
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:09.880]   one of the world's largest
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.920]   and most successful investment firms
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.680]   that is famous for the principles of radical truth
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.920]   and transparency that underlies culture.
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.760]   Ray is one of the wealthiest people in the world
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.200]   with ideas that extend far beyond the specifics
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.940]   of how you made that wealth.
[00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.400]   His ideas that are applicable to everyone
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.680]   are brilliantly summarized in his book "Principles."
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.760]   They're also even further condensed
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.280]   on several other platforms, including YouTube,
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.560]   where, for example, the 30-minute video titled
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.760]   "How the Economic Machine Works"
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.440]   is one of the best educational videos
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.580]   I personally have ever seen on YouTube.
[00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.060]   Once again, you may have noticed
[00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.600]   that the people I've been speaking with
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.520]   are not just computer scientists,
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.080]   but philosophers, mathematicians, writers,
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.560]   psychologists, physicists, economists, investors,
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.600]   and soon, much more.
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.040]   To me, AI is much bigger than deep learning,
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.440]   bigger than computing.
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.200]   It is our civilization's journey
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.160]   into understanding the human mind
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.880]   and creating echoes of it in the machine.
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.000]   That journey includes the mechanisms of our economy,
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.880]   of our politics, and the leaders
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.080]   that shape the future of both.
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.200]   This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.560]   If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.640]   give it five stars on Apple Podcast,
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.080]   support it on Patreon,
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.280]   or simply connect with me on Twitter,
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.680]   @LexFriedman, spelled F-R-I-D-M-A-N.
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.960]   This show is presented by Cash App,
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.480]   the number one finance app in the App Store.
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.220]   I personally use Cash App to send money to friends,
[00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.640]   but you can also use it to buy, sell, and deposit Bitcoin.
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.440]   Most Bitcoin exchanges take days
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.700]   for a bank transfer to become investable.
[00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.040]   Through Cash App, it takes seconds.
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.360]   Cash App also has a new investing feature.
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.120]   You can buy fractions of a stock,
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.880]   which to me is a really interesting concept.
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.720]   So you can buy $1 worth,
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.120]   no matter what the stock price is.
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.080]   Brokerage services are provided by Cash App Investing,
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.840]   a subsidiary of Square and member SIPC.
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.680]   I'm excited to be working with Cash App
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.360]   to support one of my favorite organizations
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.320]   that many of you may know and have benefited from,
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.760]   called FIRST, best known for their FIRST Robotics
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.440]   and Lego competitions.
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.120]   They educate and inspire hundreds of thousands of students
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.120]   in over 110 countries
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.560]   and have a perfect rating on Charity Navigator,
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.160]   which means the donated money
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.500]   is used to maximum effectiveness.
[00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.520]   When you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.040]   and use code LEXPODCAST, you'll get $10
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.780]   and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST,
[00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.760]   which again is an organization
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.560]   that I've personally seen inspire girls and boys
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.440]   to dream of engineering a better world.
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.900]   And now here's my conversation with Ray Dalio.
[00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.560]   Truth or more precisely an accurate understanding
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.320]   of reality is the essential foundation of any good outcome.
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.680]   I believe you've said that.
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.580]   Let me ask an absurd sounding question
[00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.840]   at the high philosophical level.
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.760]   So what is truth?
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.920]   When you're trying to do something different
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.720]   than everybody else is doing
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.760]   and perhaps something that has not been done before,
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.460]   how do you accurately analyze the situation?
[00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.400]   How do you accurately discover the truth,
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.280]   the nature of things?
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.040]   - Almost the way you're asking the question
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.040]   implies that truth and newness are almost at odds.
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.840]   And I just want to say that
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.000]   I don't think that that's true, right?
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.600]   So what I mean by truth is,
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:43.560]   you know, what is the reality?
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.440]   How does the reality work?
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.760]   And so if you're doing something new
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.040]   that has never been done before,
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.280]   which is exciting and I like to do,
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.960]   the way that you would start with that
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.120]   is experimenting on what are the realities
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.400]   and the premises that you're using on that
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.840]   and how to stress test those types of things.
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.320]   I think what you're talking about is instead
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.280]   the fact of how do you deal with something
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.040]   that's never been done before
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.160]   and deal with the associated probabilities.
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.280]   And so I think in that,
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.700]   don't let something that's never been done before
[00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.140]   stand in the way of you doing that particular thing.
[00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.680]   You have a, because almost the only way
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.120]   that you understand what truth is
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.240]   is through experimentation.
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.440]   And so when you go out and experiment,
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.280]   you're going to learn a lot more about what truth is.
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.320]   But the essence of what I'm saying
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.000]   is that when you take a look at that,
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.440]   use truth to find out what the realities are
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.720]   as a foundation.
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.560]   Do the independent thinking.
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.160]   Do the experimentation to find out what's true
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.400]   and change and keep going after that.
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.320]   So I think that when you're thinking about it
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.040]   the way you're thinking about it,
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.600]   that almost implies that you're letting people
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.540]   almost say that they're reliant on
[00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.480]   what's been discovered before to find out what's true.
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.720]   And what's been discovered before is often not true.
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:15.720]   Conventional view of what is true is very often wrong.
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.800]   It'll go in ups and downs and there are fads
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.360]   and okay, this thing, it goes this way and that way.
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.880]   And so definitions of truths that are conventional
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.720]   are not the thing to go by.
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.280]   - How do you know the thing that has been done before
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.880]   that it might succeed?
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.840]   - It's to do whatever homework that you have
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.160]   in order to try to get a foundation.
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.100]   And then to go into worlds of not knowing
[00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.200]   and you go into the world of not knowing
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.920]   but not stupidly, not naively.
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.160]   You go into that world of not knowing
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.080]   and then you do experimenting and you learn
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.680]   what truth is and what's possible through that process.
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.960]   I describe it as a five step process.
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.080]   The first step is you go after your goals.
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.780]   The second step is you identify the problems
[00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:07.180]   that stand in the way of you getting to your goals.
[00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.320]   The third step is you diagnose those
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.360]   to get at the root cause of those.
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.780]   Then the fourth step is then now that you know
[00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:17.920]   the exact root cause, you design a way to get around those
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.080]   and then you follow through and do the designs
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.920]   you set out to do and it's the experimentation.
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:27.480]   I think that what happens to people mostly
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:31.120]   is that they try to decide whether they're gonna be
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.040]   successful or not ahead of doing it.
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.160]   And they don't know how to do the process well
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.560]   because the nature of your questions are along those lines
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.800]   like how do you know?
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.680]   Well, you don't know but a practical person
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:47.220]   who is also used to making dreams happen
[00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.840]   knows how to do that process.
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:52.580]   I've given personality tests to shapers.
[00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.840]   So the person, what I mean by a shaper
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:59.840]   is a person who can take something from visualization,
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.960]   they have an audacious goal and then they go
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:06.140]   from visualization to actualization, building it out.
[00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:10.320]   That includes Elon Musk, I gave him the personality test,
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.180]   I've given it to Bill Gates and I give it
[00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:15.280]   to many, many such shapers.
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.740]   And they know that process that I'm talking about.
[00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:21.920]   They experience it which is a process essentially
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.400]   of knowing how to go from an audacious goal
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.800]   but not in a ridiculous way, not a dream
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.600]   and then to do that learning along the way
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.360]   that allows them in a very practical way
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:38.220]   to learn very rapidly as they're moving toward that goal.
[00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:42.240]   - So the call to adventure, the adventure starts
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.680]   not trying to analyze the probabilities of the situation
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:48.120]   but using what, instinct?
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.400]   How do you dive in?
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.240]   So let's talk about--
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:54.960]   - It is being a, it's simultaneously being a dreamer
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:55.860]   and a realist.
[00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:58.680]   It's to know how to do that well.
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:01.840]   The pull comes from a pull to adventure.
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:05.160]   For whatever reason, I can't tell you how much
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.680]   of it's genetics and how much it's environment
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:11.440]   but there's a early on, it's exciting.
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:15.440]   That notion is exciting, being creative is exciting
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:17.600]   and so one feels that.
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.360]   Then one gets in the habit of doing that.
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.520]   Okay, how do I know, how do I learn very well
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:27.880]   and then how do I imagine and then how do I experiment
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:30.840]   to go from that imagination?
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:34.800]   So it's that process that one, and then one,
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:38.960]   the more one does it, the better one becomes at it.
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:43.620]   - You mentioned shapers, Elon Musk, Bill Gates.
[00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:48.900]   Who are the shapers that you find yourself thinking about
[00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:51.120]   when you're constructing these ideas,
[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:54.400]   the ones that define the archetype of a shaper for you?
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.400]   - Well, as I say, a shaper for me is somebody
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:01.120]   who comes up with a great visualization,
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:04.720]   usually a really unique visualization
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:08.240]   and then actually builds it out and makes the world
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.800]   different, changes the world in that kind of a way.
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.640]   So when I look at it, Mark Benioff with Salesforce,
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:17.920]   Chris Anderson with TED, Mohammed Yunus
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.480]   with Social Enterprise and Philanthropy,
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:23.520]   Jeffrey Canada and Harlem Children's Zone.
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:27.400]   There are, all domains have shapers
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.040]   who have the ability to visualize
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:32.440]   and make extraordinary things happen.
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.980]   - What are the commonalities in some of them?
[00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:38.960]   - The commonalities are, first of all,
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:43.280]   the excitement of something new, that call to adventure
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:47.920]   and then again, that practicality, the capacity to learn.
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:52.480]   The capacity then, they're able to be in many ways
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:56.080]   full rage, that means they're able to go from
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:59.320]   the big, big picture down to the detail.
[00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:02.360]   So let's say for example, Elon Musk,
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:07.360]   he describes, he gets a lot of money from selling PayPal,
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:09.920]   his interest in PayPal, he said,
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:13.920]   "Why isn't anybody going to Mars or outer space?
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.020]   "What are we gonna do if the planet goes to hell?
[00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:18.120]   "And how do we gonna get that?
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.040]   "And nobody's paying attention to that."
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.680]   He doesn't know much about it,
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:24.440]   he then reads and learns and so on,
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:27.440]   says, "I'm gonna take, okay, half of my money
[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.540]   "and I'm gonna put it in there
[00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:30.720]   "and I'm gonna do this thing."
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.240]   And he learns and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:35.040]   and he's got creative, okay, that's one dimension.
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:39.520]   So he gave me the keys to his car,
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:42.360]   which was just early days in Tesla
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:45.680]   and he then points out the details.
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:48.120]   Okay, if you push this button here,
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.780]   it's this, the detail.
[00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:54.780]   So he's simultaneously talking about the big,
[00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:56.360]   the big, big, big picture, okay,
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:59.920]   when does humanity going to abandon the planet?
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:03.480]   But he will then be able to take it down into the detail
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:06.280]   so he can go, let's call it helicoptering.
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:07.840]   He can go up, he can go down
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:09.840]   and see things at those types of perspective.
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:11.600]   - And then you've seen that with the other shapers as well.
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.120]   - And that's a common thing that they can do that.
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:18.460]   Another important difference that they have in mind
[00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:21.120]   is how they deal with people.
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:24.280]   I mean, meaning there's nothing more important
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.160]   than achieving the mission.
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:30.960]   And so what they have in common is that there's a test
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:34.120]   that I give these personality tests
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:36.400]   'cause they're very helpful for understanding people.
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.720]   And so I gave it to all these shapers.
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:42.280]   And one of the things in workplace inventory test
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.880]   is this test and it has a category called
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:46.040]   concern for others.
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:49.580]   They're all having concern for others.
[00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:53.540]   This includes Muhammad Yunus who invented microfinance,
[00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:56.800]   social enterprise impact investing as Muhammad Yunus
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.600]   received the Nobel Peace Prize for this,
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.640]   Congressional Medal of Honor.
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:04.240]   One of them, a fortune determined
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:08.920]   one of the 10 greatest entrepreneurs of our time.
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:12.360]   He's built all sorts of businesses to give back money
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:15.000]   in social enterprise, a remarkable man.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.440]   He has nobody that I know practically
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.320]   could have more concern for others.
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.380]   He lives a life of a saint.
[00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:25.720]   I mean, very modest lifestyle and he puts all his money
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:27.280]   into trying to help others.
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:30.120]   And he tests low on what's called concern for others
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:33.240]   because what it really, the questions under that
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:36.860]   are questions about conflict to get at the mission.
[00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:40.080]   So they all, Jeffrey Canada who changed Harlem Children's
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.880]   Zone and developed that to take children in Harlem
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:44.160]   and get them well taken care of,
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:47.040]   not only just in their education, but their whole lives.
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:49.560]   Harlem, him also, concern for others.
[00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:53.680]   What they mean is that they can see
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:58.680]   whether those individuals are performing at a level,
[00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:01.660]   an extremely high level that's necessary
[00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:03.520]   to make those dreams happen.
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:06.600]   So when you think of, let's say, Steve Jobs was famous
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:09.840]   for being difficult with people and so on.
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:11.160]   And I didn't know Steve Jobs
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.120]   so I can't speak personally to that.
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.800]   But his comments on, do you have A players?
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.800]   And if you have A players, if you put in B players,
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.840]   pretty soon you'll have C players and so on.
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.040]   That is a common element of them,
[00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:24.000]   holding people to high standards
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.320]   and not letting anybody stand in the way of the mission.
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:30.120]   - What do you think about that kind of idea?
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:31.600]   Sorry to pause on that for a second,
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:36.600]   that the A, B and C players and the importance of,
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:41.120]   so when you have a mission to really only have A players
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:45.280]   and be sort of aggressively filtering for that.
[00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:47.400]   - Yes, but I think that there are all different ways
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:49.600]   of being A players.
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:53.180]   And I think, and what a great team.
[00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:55.840]   You have to appreciate all the differences
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:59.320]   in ways of being A players, okay?
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:00.520]   That's the first thing.
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:04.680]   And then you always have to be super excellent,
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:07.400]   in my opinion, you always have to be really excellent
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:11.920]   with people to help them understand themselves
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:15.940]   and get in sync with them about what's true about them
[00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:18.080]   and their circumstances and how they're doing
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:19.800]   so that they're having a fabulous
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:22.120]   personal development experience
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:24.440]   at the same time as you're dealing with them.
[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:27.720]   So when I say that they're all different ways,
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:30.600]   this is one of the then qualities.
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.480]   You asked me, what are the qualities?
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:35.480]   So one of the third qualities that I would say
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:40.520]   is to know how to deal well with your not knowing
[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:46.480]   and to be able to get the best expertise
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:50.400]   so that you're a great orchestrator of different ways
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:53.880]   so that the people who are really, really successful,
[00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:56.760]   unlike most people believe that they're successful
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:58.520]   because of what they know,
[00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:02.600]   they're even more successful by being able
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.680]   to effectively learn from others
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:06.840]   and tapping into the skills of people
[00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:09.000]   who see things different from them.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.440]   - Brilliant, so how do you, when that personality being,
[00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:14.960]   first of all, open to the fact that there's
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:18.200]   other people see things differently than you
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:22.340]   and at the same time have supreme confidence in your vision?
[00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:24.920]   Is there just the psychology of that?
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:27.300]   Do you see a tension there between the confidence
[00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:28.560]   and the open-mindedness?
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:31.220]   - And now it's funny because I think we grow up
[00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:33.200]   thinking that there's a tension there, right?
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:37.060]   That there's a confidence and the more confidence
[00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:40.560]   that you have, there's a tension with the open-mindedness
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:42.760]   and not being sure, okay?
[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:48.620]   Confident and accurate are almost negatively correlated
[00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:50.120]   in many people.
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:53.840]   They're extremely confident and they're often inaccurate.
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:57.360]   And so I think one of the greatest tragedies of people
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:00.220]   is not realizing how those things go together
[00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:04.200]   because instead it's really that by saying,
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:08.600]   I know a lot and how do I know I'm still not wrong
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:13.480]   and how do I take that best thinking available to me
[00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:16.660]   and then raise my probability of learning?
[00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:19.600]   All these people think for themselves, okay?
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:21.520]   I mean, meaning they're smart,
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:24.000]   but they take in like vacuum cleaners,
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.200]   they take in ideas of others,
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:28.840]   they stress test their ideas with others,
[00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:31.140]   they assess what comes back to them
[00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:33.660]   in the form of other thinking
[00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:36.340]   and they also know what they're not good at
[00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:38.840]   and what other people who are good at the things
[00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:41.520]   that they're not good at, they know how to get those people
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:43.620]   and be successful all around
[00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:46.960]   because nobody has enough knowledge in their heads.
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:49.600]   And that I think is one of the great differences.
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:53.400]   So the reason my company has been successful
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:55.200]   in terms of this is 'cause of an idea
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:58.000]   meritocratic decision-making, a process
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.900]   by which you can get the best ideas.
[00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:02.840]   You know, what's an idea meritocracy?
[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:05.860]   An idea meritocracy is to get the best ideas
[00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:07.080]   that are available out there
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:09.300]   and to work together with other people
[00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:10.760]   in the team to achieve that.
[00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:12.000]   - That's an incredible process
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.400]   that you describe in several places to arrive at the truth.
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:18.640]   But I apologize if I'm romanticizing the notion,
[00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:19.840]   but let me linger on it.
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:23.680]   Just having enough self-belief,
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:27.580]   you don't think there's a self-delusion there
[00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:30.040]   that's necessary, especially in the beginning
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:34.640]   you talk about in the journey, maybe the trials or the abyss.
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:39.640]   Do you think there is value to deluding yourself?
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:44.280]   - I think what you're calling delusion
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:48.880]   is a bad word for uncertainty, okay?
[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:52.000]   So I mean, in other words, 'cause we keep going back
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   to the question, how would you know,
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.040]   and all of those things.
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:58.640]   No, I think that delusion is not gonna help you,
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:01.460]   that you have to find out truth, okay?
[00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:03.900]   To deal with uncertainty, not saying,
[00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:05.340]   listen, I have this dream,
[00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:08.140]   and I don't know how I'm going to get that dream.
[00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:10.140]   I mentioned in my book, "Principles,"
[00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:12.920]   and described the process in a more complete way
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:15.060]   than we're gonna be able to go here.
[00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:19.780]   But what happens is I say, you form your dreams first,
[00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:22.460]   and you can't judge whether you're going
[00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:26.900]   to achieve those dreams because you haven't learned
[00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:28.700]   the things that you're going to learn
[00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:31.420]   on the way toward those dreams, okay?
[00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:35.660]   So that isn't delusion, I wouldn't use delusion.
[00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:38.740]   I think you're overemphasizing the importance
[00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:41.660]   of knowing whether you're going to succeed or not.
[00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:43.220]   Get rid of that, okay?
[00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:45.300]   If you can get rid of that and say,
[00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:48.380]   okay, no, I can have that dream,
[00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:52.700]   but I'm so realistic in the notion of finding out.
[00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:56.460]   I'm curious, I'm a great learner, I'm a great experimenter.
[00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:58.780]   Along the way, you'll do those experiments
[00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:00.780]   which will teach you more truths
[00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:03.220]   and more learning about the reality
[00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:04.980]   so that you can get your dreams.
[00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:08.420]   Because if you still live in that world of delusion, okay,
[00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:10.380]   and you think delusion's helpful,
[00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:12.260]   no, the delusion isn't,
[00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:14.540]   don't confuse delusion with not knowing.
[00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:17.380]   - Yes, but nevertheless,
[00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:18.940]   so if we look at the abyss,
[00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:22.060]   we can look at your own that you described.
[00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:24.220]   It's difficult psychologically for people.
[00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:27.500]   So many people quit, many people choose a path
[00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:28.960]   that is more comfortable.
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:34.660]   The heartbreak of that breaks people.
[00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:36.180]   So if you have the dream
[00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:37.940]   and there's this cycle of learning,
[00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:40.060]   setting a goal and so on,
[00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:42.180]   what's your value for the psychology
[00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:45.440]   of just being broken by these difficult moments?
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:48.380]   - Well, that's classically the defining moment.
[00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:51.720]   It's almost like evolution taking care of,
[00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:55.460]   okay, now you crash, you're in the abyss,
[00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:56.980]   oh my God, that's bad.
[00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:59.300]   And then the question is, what do you do?
[00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:01.260]   And it sorts people, okay?
[00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:04.720]   And that's what, some people get off the field
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:07.300]   and they say, oh, I don't like this and so on.
[00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:12.300]   And some people learn and they have a metamorphosis
[00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:16.140]   and it changes their approach to learning.
[00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:19.520]   The number one thing it should give them is uncertainty.
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:23.920]   You should take an audacious, dreamer,
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:28.660]   guy who wants to change the world, crash, okay?
[00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:31.700]   And then come out of that crashing and saying,
[00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:35.160]   okay, I can be audacious
[00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:39.640]   and scared that I'm gonna be wrong at the same time.
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:40.980]   And then how do I do that?
[00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:42.360]   Because that's the key.
[00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:44.520]   When you don't lose your audaciousness
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:46.860]   and you keep going after your big goal,
[00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:48.380]   and at the same time you say,
[00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:50.600]   hey, I'm worried that I'm gonna be wrong,
[00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:53.740]   you gain your radical open-mindedness
[00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:56.080]   that allows you to take in the things
[00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:59.540]   that allows you to go to the next level of being successful.
[00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:01.360]   - So your own process, I mean,
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.540]   you've talked about it before,
[00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:05.220]   but it would be great if you can describe it
[00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:06.580]   because our darkest moments
[00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:07.940]   are perhaps the most interesting.
[00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:10.180]   So your own and with the prediction
[00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:13.240]   of another depression.
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:14.440]   - Economic depression.
[00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:17.120]   - Yes, I apologize, economic depression.
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:20.600]   Can you talk to what you were feeling,
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:24.600]   thinking, planning, strategizing at those moments?
[00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:28.840]   - Yeah, that was my biggest moment, okay?
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:30.880]   Building my little company.
[00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:34.120]   This is in 1981, '82.
[00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:36.720]   I had calculated that American banks
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:40.040]   had given a lot more money to Lent,
[00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:42.120]   a lot more money to Latin American countries
[00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:44.060]   than those countries were gonna pay back,
[00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:46.720]   and that they would have a debt crisis,
[00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:49.880]   and that this would send the economy tumbling,
[00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:53.520]   and that was an extremely controversial point of view.
[00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:54.920]   Then it started to happen,
[00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:58.800]   and it happened in Mexico defaulted in August, 1982.
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:02.440]   I thought that there was gonna be an economic collapse
[00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:03.380]   that was gonna follow
[00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:05.640]   because there was a series of the other countries,
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:08.160]   it was just playing out as I had imagined,
[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:11.000]   and that couldn't have been more wrong.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.080]   That was the exact bottom in the stock market
[00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:17.440]   because central banks, monetary policy, blah, blah, blah,
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:19.120]   and I couldn't have been more wrong,
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:21.940]   and I was very publicly wrong, and all of that,
[00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:24.800]   and I lost money for me, and I lost money for my clients,
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:27.880]   and I only had a small company then,
[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:32.080]   but these were close people, I had to let them go.
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:35.680]   I was down to me as the last person.
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:40.000]   I was so broke I had to borrow $4,000 from my dad
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.160]   to help to pay for my family bills, very painful,
[00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:47.600]   and at the same time, I would say it definitely was
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:50.480]   one of the best things that ever happened to me,
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:52.360]   maybe the best thing for him happened to me
[00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:55.100]   because it changed my approach to decision making.
[00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:56.360]   It's what I'm saying.
[00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:58.360]   In other words, I kept saying,
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:01.040]   okay, how do I know whether I'm right?
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:02.880]   How do I know I'm not wrong?
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:07.520]   It gave me that, and it didn't give up my audaciousness
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:10.720]   because I was in a position, what am I gonna do?
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:14.720]   Am I gonna go back, put on a tie, go to Wall Street,
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:16.560]   and just do those things?
[00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:19.640]   No, I can't bring myself to do that, so I'm at a juncture.
[00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:22.200]   How do I deal with my risk, and how do I deal with that?
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:25.240]   And it told me how to deal with my uncertainties,
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:28.800]   and that taught me, for example, a number of techniques.
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:31.780]   First, to find the smartest people I could find
[00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:35.240]   who disagreed with me, and to have quality disagreement.
[00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:37.440]   I learned the art of thoughtful disagreement.
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:39.720]   I learned how to produce diversification.
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:41.840]   I learned how to do a number of things.
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:46.120]   That is what led me to create an idea meritocracy.
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:48.480]   In other words, person by person, I hired them,
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:50.360]   and I wanted the smartest people
[00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:51.800]   who would be independent thinkers
[00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:55.040]   who would disagree with each other and me well
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:57.600]   so that we could be independent thinkers
[00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:00.240]   to go off to produce those audacious dreams
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:02.540]   'cause you have to be an independent thinker to do that,
[00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:05.540]   and to do that not independently of the consensus,
[00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:06.940]   independently of each other,
[00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:08.820]   and then work ourselves through that
[00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:11.460]   'cause who know whether you're gonna have the right answer,
[00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:15.780]   and by doing that, then that was the key to our success,
[00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:18.280]   and the things that I wanna pass along to people.
[00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:20.900]   The reason I'm doing this podcast with you
[00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:25.700]   is I'm 70 years old, and that is a magical way
[00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:28.940]   of achieving success if you can create
[00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:30.940]   an idea meritocracy.
[00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:34.060]   It's so much better in terms of achieving success
[00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:36.700]   and also quality relationships with people,
[00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:38.960]   but that's what that experience gave me.
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:41.580]   - So if we can linger on a little bit longer,
[00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:44.940]   the idea of an idea meritocracy, it's fascinating,
[00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:48.060]   but especially because it seems to be rare,
[00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:50.960]   not just in companies but in society.
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:53.100]   So there's a lot of people on Twitter
[00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:55.800]   and public discourse and politics and so on
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:58.260]   that are really stuck in certain sets of ideas,
[00:24:58.260 --> 00:24:59.940]   whatever they are.
[00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:03.460]   So when you're confronted with an idea
[00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:08.460]   that's different than your own about a particular topic,
[00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:12.740]   what kind of process do you go through mentally?
[00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:16.100]   Are you arguing through the idea with the person?
[00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:18.340]   Sort of present is almost like a debate,
[00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:21.020]   or do you sit on it and consider the world
[00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:23.980]   sort of empathetically if this is true?
[00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:27.300]   Then what does that world look like?
[00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:28.820]   Does that world make sense and so on?
[00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:30.520]   So what's the process of considering
[00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:32.860]   those conflicting ideas for you?
[00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:36.820]   - I'm gonna answer that question after saying first,
[00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:41.340]   almost implicit in your question is it's not common.
[00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:45.760]   What's common produces only common results.
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:50.100]   So don't judge anything that is good
[00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:51.620]   based on whether it's common,
[00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:53.620]   'cause it's only gonna give you common results.
[00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:56.180]   If you want unique, you have a unique approach.
[00:25:57.220 --> 00:26:00.460]   And so that art of thoughtful disagreement
[00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:04.580]   is the capacity to hold two things
[00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:06.460]   in your mind at the same time.
[00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:09.740]   The, gee, I think this makes sense,
[00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:13.380]   and then saying, I'm not sure it makes sense,
[00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:17.620]   and then try to say, why does it make sense,
[00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:20.180]   and then to triangulate with others.
[00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:22.500]   So if I'm having a discussion like that
[00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:26.580]   and I work myself through and I'm not sure,
[00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:29.220]   then I have to do that in a good way.
[00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:32.220]   So I always give attention, for example,
[00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:34.340]   let's start off, what does the other person know
[00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:36.120]   relative to what I know?
[00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:39.820]   So if a person has a higher expertise or things,
[00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:42.240]   I'm much more inclined to ask questions.
[00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:43.820]   I'm always asking questions.
[00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:46.620]   If you wanna learn, you're asking questions,
[00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:48.460]   you're not arguing, okay?
[00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:51.820]   You're taking in, you're assessing when it comes into you.
[00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:52.980]   Does that make sense?
[00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:54.100]   Are you learning something?
[00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:56.020]   Are you getting epiphanies and so on?
[00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:57.540]   And I try to then do that.
[00:26:57.540 --> 00:27:02.540]   If the conversation, as we're trying to decide what is true,
[00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:04.580]   and we're trying to do that together,
[00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:06.220]   and we see truth different,
[00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:09.060]   then I might even call in another
[00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:12.360]   really smart, capable person and try to say,
[00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:15.420]   what is true and how do we explore that together?
[00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:17.660]   And you go through that same thing.
[00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:22.580]   So I would, I said, I describe it as having open-mindedness
[00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:24.980]   and assertiveness at the same time.
[00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:28.580]   That you can simultaneously be open-minded
[00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:30.940]   and take in with that curiosity
[00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:32.620]   and then also be assertive and say,
[00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:33.840]   but that doesn't make sense.
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:35.660]   Why would this be the case?
[00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:37.460]   And you do that back and forth.
[00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:41.540]   - And when you're doing that kind of back and forth
[00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:44.800]   on a topic like the economy, which you have,
[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:49.540]   to me, perhaps I'm naive, but it seems both incredible
[00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:53.580]   and incredibly complex, the economy, the trading,
[00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:56.140]   the transactions, that these transactions
[00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:58.540]   between two individuals somehow add up
[00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:00.300]   to this giant mechanism.
[00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:03.180]   You've put out a 30-minute video.
[00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:06.500]   You have a lot of incredible videos online
[00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:10.080]   that people should definitely watch on YouTube.
[00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:11.660]   But you've put out this 30-minute video
[00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:14.620]   titled How the Economic Machine Works.
[00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:19.100]   That is probably one of the best, if not the best video
[00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:22.420]   I've seen on the internet in terms of educational videos.
[00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:24.260]   So people should definitely watch it,
[00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:29.260]   especially because it's not that the individual components
[00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:31.940]   of the video are somehow revolutionary,
[00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:33.600]   but the simplicity and the clarity
[00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:36.180]   of the different components just makes you,
[00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:37.740]   there's a few light bulb moments there
[00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:40.880]   about how the economy works as a machine.
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:43.180]   So as you described, there's three main forces
[00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:45.180]   that drive the economy, productivity growth,
[00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:48.380]   short-term debt cycle, long-term debt cycle.
[00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:52.140]   The former productivity growth is how valuable things
[00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:57.140]   how much value people create, valuable things people create.
[00:28:57.140 --> 00:29:02.100]   The latter is people borrowing from their future selves
[00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:05.220]   to hopefully create those valuable things faster.
[00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:07.420]   So this is an incredible system to me.
[00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:09.980]   Maybe we can linger on it a little bit.
[00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:14.180]   But you've also said what most people think about
[00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:15.700]   as money is actually credit.
[00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:20.580]   Total amount of credit in the US is $50 trillion.
[00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:23.060]   Total amount of money is $3 trillion.
[00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:26.060]   That's just crazy to me.
[00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:28.540]   Maybe I'm silly, maybe you can educate me,
[00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:29.920]   but that seems crazy.
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:33.460]   It gives me just pause that the human civilization
[00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:37.140]   has been able to create a system that has so much credit.
[00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:40.900]   So that's a long way to ask,
[00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:45.060]   do you think credit is good or bad for society?
[00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:49.200]   That system that's so fundamentally based on credit.
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:51.300]   - I think credit is great,
[00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:54.500]   even though people often overdo it.
[00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:58.580]   Credit is that somebody has earned money.
[00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:04.820]   What happens is they lend it to somebody else
[00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:07.500]   who's got better ideas and they cut a deal.
[00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:09.500]   Then that person with the better ideas
[00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:10.540]   is gonna pay it back.
[00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:15.540]   And if it works well, it helps resource allocations go well,
[00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:18.340]   providing people like the entrepreneurs
[00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:20.520]   and all of those, they need capital.
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:22.220]   They don't have capital themselves.
[00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:24.060]   And so somebody is gonna give them capital
[00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:26.620]   and they'll give them credit and along those lines.
[00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:30.220]   Then what happens is it's not managed well
[00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:31.900]   in a variety of ways.
[00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:34.500]   So I did another book on principles,
[00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:38.700]   principles of big debt crises that go into that.
[00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:43.700]   And it's free by the way, I put it free online as a PDF.
[00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:47.100]   So if you go online and you look principles
[00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:48.900]   of big debt crisis is under my name,
[00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:50.660]   you can download it in a PDF
[00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:52.900]   or you can buy a print book of it.
[00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:55.780]   And it goes through that particular process.
[00:30:55.780 --> 00:31:00.780]   And so you always have it overdone in always the same way.
[00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:04.200]   Everything by the way, almost everything happens
[00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:06.300]   over and over again for the same reasons.
[00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:09.700]   Okay, so these debt crises all happen over and over again
[00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:11.100]   for the same reasons.
[00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:12.420]   They get it overdone.
[00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:14.400]   In the book it explains how you identify
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:16.100]   whether it's overdone or not.
[00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:19.280]   They get it overdone and then you go through the process
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:21.580]   of making the adjustments according that.
[00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:24.460]   And then, and it explains how they can use the levers
[00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:25.340]   and so on.
[00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:29.180]   If you didn't have credit, then you would be sort of,
[00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:30.860]   everybody sort of be stuck.
[00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:35.860]   So credit is a good thing, but it can easily be overdone.
[00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:39.800]   So now we get into the question, what is money?
[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:41.060]   What is credit?
[00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:43.260]   Okay, you get into money and credit.
[00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:46.540]   So if you're holding credit and you think that's worthwhile,
[00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:48.800]   keep in mind that the central bank,
[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:50.500]   let's say it can print the money.
[00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:51.980]   What is that problem?
[00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:55.660]   You have an IOU and the IOU says you're gonna get
[00:31:55.660 --> 00:32:00.260]   a certain number of dollars, let's say, or yen or euros.
[00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:02.660]   And that is what the IOU is.
[00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:06.220]   And so the question is, will you get that money
[00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:07.900]   and what will it be worth?
[00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:10.540]   And then also you have a government
[00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:13.060]   which is a participant in that process.
[00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:16.420]   'Cause they are on the hook, they owe money.
[00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:19.460]   And then will they print the money to make it easy
[00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:20.980]   for everybody to pay?
[00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:23.180]   So you have to pay attention to those two.
[00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:26.460]   I would suggest like you recommend to other people,
[00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:30.740]   just take that 30 minutes and it comes across
[00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:31.580]   pretty clearly.
[00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:35.180]   But my conclusion is that of course you want it.
[00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:39.900]   And even if you understand it and the cycles well,
[00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:43.140]   you can benefit from those cycles rather than
[00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:45.380]   to be hurt by those cycles.
[00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:48.660]   Because I don't know the way the cycle works
[00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:50.460]   is somebody gets over indebted,
[00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:53.620]   they have to sell an asset, okay, then I don't know,
[00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:55.740]   that's when assets become cheaper.
[00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:57.420]   How do you acquire the asset?
[00:32:57.420 --> 00:32:59.260]   It's a whole process.
[00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:03.860]   - So again, maybe another dumb question but--
[00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:06.020]   - There are no such things as dumb questions.
[00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:06.860]   - There you go.
[00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:07.960]   But what is money?
[00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:12.060]   So you've mentioned credit and money.
[00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:16.460]   Another thing that if I just zoom out
[00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:19.420]   from an alien perspective and look at human civilization,
[00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:22.740]   it's incredible that we've created a thing
[00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:27.380]   that's not, that only works because currency,
[00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:30.460]   because we all agree it has value.
[00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:36.380]   So I guess my question is how do you think about money
[00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:38.940]   as this emergent phenomenon?
[00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:41.740]   And what do you think is the future of money?
[00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:44.460]   You've commented on Bitcoin, other forms.
[00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:48.580]   What do you think is its history and future?
[00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:51.320]   How do you think about money?
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:55.100]   - There are two things that money is for.
[00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:59.820]   It's a medium of exchange and it's a storehold of wealth.
[00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:01.100]   - Yes.
[00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:05.500]   - So money, so you could say something's a medium
[00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:07.500]   of exchange and then you could say
[00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:10.300]   is it a storehold of wealth, okay?
[00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:15.300]   So those, and money is that vehicle that is those things
[00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:20.800]   and can be used to pay off your debt.
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:25.020]   So when you have a debt and you provide it,
[00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:26.840]   it pays off your debt.
[00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:28.740]   So that's that process.
[00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:31.180]   - And it's, I apologize to interrupt,
[00:34:31.180 --> 00:34:35.100]   but it only can be a medium of exchange or store wealth
[00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:37.700]   when everybody recognizes it to be a value.
[00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:38.660]   - That's right.
[00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:41.420]   And so you see in the history around the world
[00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:46.420]   and you go to places, I was in an island in the Pacific
[00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:53.340]   in which they had as money these big stones
[00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:56.780]   and literally they were taking a boat,
[00:34:56.780 --> 00:35:00.140]   this big carved stone, and they were taking it
[00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:01.540]   from one of the islands to the other
[00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:06.580]   and it sank, the piece of this big stone piece of money
[00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:10.120]   that they had, and it went to the bottom
[00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:13.580]   and they still perceived it as having value
[00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:15.940]   so that it was, even though it was in the bottom
[00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:17.820]   and it's this big hunk of rock,
[00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:19.260]   the fact that somebody owned it,
[00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:21.940]   they would say, oh, I'll own it for this and that.
[00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:25.460]   I've seen beads in different places,
[00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:28.840]   shells converted to this and mediums of exchange.
[00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:30.860]   And when we look at what we've got,
[00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:33.500]   you're exactly right, it is the notion
[00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:36.180]   that if I give it to you, I can then take it
[00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:37.900]   and I can buy something with it.
[00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:41.500]   And that's, so it's a matter of perception, okay.
[00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:45.020]   And then we go through then the history of money
[00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:47.500]   and the vulnerabilities of money.
[00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:50.820]   And what we have is, there's through history,
[00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:52.860]   there's been two types of money,
[00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:57.860]   those that are claims on something of value,
[00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:01.620]   like the connection to gold or something.
[00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:02.460]   - That's right.
[00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:05.660]   - That would be, or they just are money
[00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:08.840]   without any connection, and then we have a system now,
[00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:10.940]   which is a fiat monetary system.
[00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:12.700]   So that's what money is.
[00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:17.700]   Then it will last as long as it's kept a value
[00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:19.140]   and it works that way.
[00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:23.780]   So let's say central banks, when they get in the position
[00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:26.220]   of like they owe a lot of money,
[00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:29.780]   like we have in the case, it's increasingly the case,
[00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:33.700]   and they also are a bind and they have the printing press
[00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:36.700]   to print the money and get out of that.
[00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:39.500]   And you have a lot of people might be in that position.
[00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:42.460]   Then you can print it and then it could be devalued
[00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:46.900]   in there, and so history has shown, forget about today,
[00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:51.160]   history has shown that no currency has,
[00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:55.900]   every currency has either ended as being a currency,
[00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:59.900]   or devalued as a currency over periods of time,
[00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:01.420]   long periods of time.
[00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:04.500]   So it evolves and it changes, but everybody needs
[00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:07.260]   that medium of exchange, and everybody needs
[00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:10.200]   that storehold of wealth, so it keeps changing
[00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:12.340]   what is money over a period of time.
[00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:16.780]   - But so much is being digitized today,
[00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:19.340]   and there's this ideas that are based
[00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:22.580]   on the blockchain of Bitcoin and so on.
[00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:27.580]   So if all currencies, like all empires come to an end,
[00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:30.660]   what do you think, do you think something like Bitcoin
[00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:34.340]   might emerge as a common store of value,
[00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:37.860]   a store of wealth, and a medium of exchange?
[00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:42.860]   - The problem with Bitcoin is that it's not
[00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:45.740]   an effective medium of exchange, like it's not easy
[00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:49.100]   for me to go in there and buy things with it,
[00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:52.060]   and then it's not an effective storehold of value
[00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:56.020]   because it has a volatility that's based on speculation
[00:37:56.020 --> 00:38:00.020]   and the like, so it's not a very effective saving.
[00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:03.500]   That's very different from Facebook's
[00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:06.820]   of a stable value currency, which would be effective
[00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:11.140]   as both a medium of exchange and a storehold of wealth,
[00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:14.780]   because if you were to hold it, and the way it's linked to,
[00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:16.900]   number of things that it's linked to,
[00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:19.340]   would mean that it could be a very effective
[00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:22.500]   storehold of wealth, and then you have a digital currency
[00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:24.980]   that could be a very effective medium of exchange
[00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:26.780]   and storehold of wealth.
[00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:29.940]   So in my opinion, some digital currencies
[00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:32.820]   are likely to succeed more or less
[00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:35.060]   based on that ability to do it.
[00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:37.940]   Then the question is, what happens?
[00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:40.740]   Okay, what happens is, do central banks
[00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:42.660]   allow that to happen?
[00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:46.540]   I really do believe it's possible to get a better form
[00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:50.500]   of money that central banks don't control, okay?
[00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:54.540]   A better force of money that central banks don't control,
[00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:57.820]   but then that's not yet happened,
[00:38:57.820 --> 00:39:01.060]   and we also have to, and so they've got to go through
[00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:03.460]   that evolutionary process.
[00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:05.700]   In order to go through that evolutionary process,
[00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:09.140]   first of all, governments have got to allow that to happen,
[00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:11.500]   which is to some extent a threat to them
[00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:14.620]   in terms of their power, and that's an issue,
[00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:17.540]   and then you have to also build the confidence
[00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:21.420]   in all of the components of it to say,
[00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:23.580]   okay, that's going to be effective
[00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:28.580]   because I won't have problems owning it.
[00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:30.940]   So I think that digital currencies
[00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:35.220]   have some element of potential,
[00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:38.260]   but there's a lot of hurdles that are going
[00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:39.900]   to have to be gotten over.
[00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:42.820]   I think that it'll be a very long time,
[00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:46.140]   possibly never, but anyway, a very long time
[00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:48.980]   before we have that, let's say, get into a position
[00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:53.980]   that would be in an effective means relative to gold,
[00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:56.300]   let's say, if you were to think of that,
[00:39:56.300 --> 00:40:00.620]   because gold has a track record of thousands of years
[00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:03.300]   all across countries.
[00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:04.800]   It has its mobility.
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:06.460]   It has the ability to put it down.
[00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:07.540]   It has certain abilities.
[00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:12.100]   It's got disadvantages relative to digital currencies,
[00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:14.260]   but central banks will hold it.
[00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:18.380]   There's central banks that worry about others.
[00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:20.180]   Other countries, central banks might worry
[00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:23.100]   about whether the US dollar is going to print that,
[00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:24.820]   and so the thing they're going to go to
[00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:26.940]   is not going to be the digital currency.
[00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:30.740]   Thing they're going to go to is gold or something else,
[00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:31.580]   some other currency.
[00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:35.380]   They got to pick it, and so I think it's a long way to go.
[00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:37.260]   - Well, you think it's possible that one day
[00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:39.140]   we don't even have a central bank
[00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:44.140]   because of a currency that cannot be controlled
[00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:47.920]   by the central bank is the primary currency,
[00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:50.620]   or does that seem very unlikely?
[00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:57.940]   - It would be very remote possibility
[00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:00.420]   or very long in the future.
[00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:01.460]   - Got it.
[00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:04.220]   Again, maybe a dumb question, but romanticize one.
[00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:06.060]   When you sit back and you look,
[00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:09.820]   you describe these transactions between individuals
[00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:13.900]   somehow creating short-term debt cycles,
[00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:17.460]   long-term debt cycles, this productivity growth.
[00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:22.380]   Does it amaze you that this whole thing works,
[00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:25.340]   that there's however many millions,
[00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:27.780]   hundreds of millions of people in the United States,
[00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:30.180]   globally over seven billion people,
[00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:33.080]   that this thing between individual transactions,
[00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:36.180]   it works?
[00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:38.540]   - Yeah, it amazes me.
[00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:43.380]   I go back and forth between being in it,
[00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:48.020]   and then I think, how did a credit card,
[00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:49.620]   how is that really possible?
[00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:52.540]   I'm still used, I look up credit card, I put it on,
[00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:53.900]   the guy doesn't know me.
[00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:56.260]   - Yeah, it's all strangers.
[00:41:56.260 --> 00:41:58.660]   - Okay, we're making the digital entries.
[00:41:58.660 --> 00:42:01.100]   Is that really secure enough and that kind of thing?
[00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:03.180]   And then it goes back, and it goes this,
[00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:05.540]   and it clears, and it all happens.
[00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:09.700]   And what I marvel at that, and those types of things,
[00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:14.260]   is because of the capacity of the human mind
[00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:19.020]   to create abstractions that are true.
[00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:23.380]   It's imagination, and then the ability to go from one level,
[00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:25.660]   and then if these things are true,
[00:42:25.660 --> 00:42:27.100]   then you go to the next level,
[00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:28.880]   and if those things are true,
[00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:30.180]   then you go to the next level.
[00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:33.700]   And all those miracles that we almost become common,
[00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:36.420]   it's like when I'm flying in a plane,
[00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:39.540]   or when I'm looking at all of the things that happen.
[00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:42.620]   When I get communications in the middle of,
[00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:45.060]   I don't know, Africa or Antarctica,
[00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:47.220]   and we're communicating in the ways
[00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:50.460]   where I see the face on my iPad of somebody,
[00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:52.540]   my grandkid in someplace else,
[00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:57.540]   and I look at this and I say, wow, yes, it all amazes me.
[00:42:58.100 --> 00:43:01.620]   - So while being amazing, do you have a sense,
[00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:02.940]   the principles you described,
[00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:06.140]   that the whole thing is stable somehow also?
[00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:09.340]   Or is this, are we just lucky?
[00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:11.620]   So the principles that you described,
[00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:16.180]   are those describing a system that is stable,
[00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:18.580]   robust, and will remain so,
[00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:22.940]   or is it a lucky accident of our early history?
[00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:26.000]   - My area of expertise is economics and markets,
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.860]   so I get down to a real nitty gritty.
[00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:30.260]   I can't tell you whether the plane
[00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:32.300]   is gonna fall out of the sky
[00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:34.980]   because of its particular fundamentals.
[00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:36.380]   I don't know enough about that,
[00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:37.980]   but it happens over and over again,
[00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:39.780]   and so on, it gives me faith, okay?
[00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:41.300]   So without me knowing it.
[00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:43.800]   In the markets and the economy,
[00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:47.440]   I know those things well enough, in a sense,
[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:52.440]   to say that by and large, that structure is right,
[00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:55.120]   what we're seeing is right.
[00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:58.060]   Now, whether there are disruptions,
[00:43:58.060 --> 00:44:01.200]   and it has effects that can come,
[00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:03.180]   not because that structure is right,
[00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:04.600]   and I believe it's right,
[00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:08.100]   but whether it can be hurt by, let's say,
[00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:11.200]   connectivity or journal entries.
[00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:13.500]   They could take all the money away from you
[00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:15.340]   through your digital entries.
[00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:19.100]   There's all sorts of things that can happen in various ways
[00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:22.000]   that means that that money is worthless,
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:23.620]   or the system falls,
[00:44:23.620 --> 00:44:26.860]   but from what I see in terms of its basic structure,
[00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:30.180]   and those complexities that still take my breath away,
[00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:33.580]   I would say knowing enough about the mechanics of them,
[00:44:33.580 --> 00:44:34.860]   that doesn't worry me.
[00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:37.040]   - Have you seen disruptions in your lifetime
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:38.260]   that really surprised you?
[00:44:38.260 --> 00:44:39.800]   - Oh, all the time.
[00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:42.180]   This is one of the great lessons of my life,
[00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:46.520]   is that many times I've seen things
[00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:50.460]   that I was very surprised about,
[00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:54.920]   and that I realized almost all of those
[00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:58.140]   I was surprised about because they were just
[00:44:58.140 --> 00:45:00.260]   the first time it happened to me.
[00:45:00.260 --> 00:45:02.620]   They didn't happen in my lifetime before,
[00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:04.660]   but when I researched them,
[00:45:04.660 --> 00:45:08.220]   they happened in other places or other people's lifetimes.
[00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:13.220]   So, for example, I remember 1971, the dollar,
[00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:16.740]   there was no such thing as a devaluation of a currency.
[00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:18.540]   It didn't experience it,
[00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:21.340]   and the dollar was connected to gold,
[00:45:21.340 --> 00:45:23.220]   and I was watching events happen,
[00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:26.580]   and then you get on, and that definition of money
[00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:29.100]   all of a sudden went out the window
[00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:31.380]   because it was not tied to gold,
[00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:33.740]   and then you have this devaluation.
[00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:37.100]   And then, or the first oil shock,
[00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:41.060]   or the second oil shock, or so many of these things.
[00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:46.900]   But almost always, I realized that they,
[00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:50.100]   when I looked in history, they happened before.
[00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:53.020]   They just happened in other people's lifetimes,
[00:45:53.020 --> 00:45:58.020]   which led me to realize that I needed to study history
[00:45:58.020 --> 00:46:00.900]   and what happened in other people's lifetimes
[00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:04.140]   and what happened in other countries and places
[00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:07.780]   so that I would have timeless and universal principles
[00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:09.360]   for dealing with that thing.
[00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:13.860]   So, oh yeah, I've been, the implausible happening.
[00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:17.660]   But it's like a one in a hundred year storm.
[00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:19.060]   - Right. - Okay?
[00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:22.180]   Or it's, or-- - They've happened before.
[00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:24.420]   - Yeah, they've happened. - Just not to you.
[00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:28.180]   Let me talk about, if we could, about AI a little bit.
[00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:32.900]   So we've, Bridgewater Associates manage
[00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:36.640]   about $160 billion in assets,
[00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:40.300]   and our artificial intelligence systems,
[00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:43.620]   algorithms are pretty good with data.
[00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:47.980]   What role in the future do you see AI play
[00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:50.260]   in analysis and decision making
[00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:55.260]   in this kind of data-rich and impactful area of investment?
[00:46:55.260 --> 00:46:59.900]   - I'm gonna answer that not only in investment,
[00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:04.900]   but I give a more all-encompassing rule for AI.
[00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:11.460]   As I think you know, for the last 25 years,
[00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:15.700]   we have taken our thinking and put them in algorithms,
[00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:17.900]   and so we make decisions.
[00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:22.180]   The computer takes those criteria, algorithms,
[00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:24.140]   and they put them, they're in there,
[00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:27.500]   and it takes data, and they operate
[00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:29.500]   as an independent decision maker
[00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:31.660]   in parallel with our decision making.
[00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:35.420]   So for me, it's like there's a chess game playing,
[00:47:35.420 --> 00:47:38.420]   and I'm a person with my chess game,
[00:47:38.420 --> 00:47:39.940]   and I'm saying it made that move,
[00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:42.060]   and I'm making the move, and how do I compare
[00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:43.940]   those two moves, so we've done a lot.
[00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:45.980]   But let me give you a rule.
[00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:49.980]   If the future can be different from the past,
[00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:55.080]   and you don't have deep understanding,
[00:47:55.080 --> 00:48:01.180]   you should not rely on AI, okay?
[00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:03.260]   Those two things.
[00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:05.180]   - Deep understanding of?
[00:48:05.180 --> 00:48:07.100]   - The cause-effect relationships
[00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:11.020]   that are leading you to place that bet in anything, okay?
[00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:12.940]   Anything important.
[00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:14.980]   Let's say if it was do surgeries,
[00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:17.420]   and you would say, how do I do surgeries?
[00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:20.780]   I think it's totally fine to watch all the doctors
[00:48:20.780 --> 00:48:21.620]   do the surgeries.
[00:48:21.620 --> 00:48:26.620]   You can put it on, take a digital camera and do that,
[00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:32.980]   convert that into AI algorithms that go to robots,
[00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:34.980]   and have them do surgeries,
[00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:36.740]   and I'd be comfortable with that.
[00:48:36.740 --> 00:48:40.920]   Because if it keeps doing the same thing over and over again
[00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:43.940]   and you have enough of that, that would be fine,
[00:48:43.940 --> 00:48:46.700]   even though you may not understand the algorithms,
[00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:49.440]   because if the thing's happening over and over again,
[00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:52.020]   and you're not asking, the future would be the same,
[00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:54.220]   that appendicitis or whatever it is,
[00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:57.620]   will be handled the same way the surgery, that's fine.
[00:48:57.620 --> 00:49:02.620]   However, what happens with AI is, for the most part,
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.160]   is it takes a lot of data,
[00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:09.600]   with a high enough sample size,
[00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:13.240]   and then it puts together its own algorithms.
[00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:16.200]   Okay, there are two ways you can come up with algorithms.
[00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:18.360]   You can either take your thinking
[00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:20.640]   and express them in algorithms,
[00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:25.640]   or you can put the data in and say, what is the algorithm?
[00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:27.920]   That's machine learning.
[00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:30.620]   And when you have machine learning,
[00:49:30.620 --> 00:49:32.080]   it'll give you equations,
[00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:35.120]   which quite often are not understandable.
[00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:36.160]   If you would try to say,
[00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:38.400]   okay, now describe what it's telling you,
[00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:40.160]   it's very difficult to describe,
[00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:42.960]   and so they can escape understanding.
[00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:46.280]   And so it's very good for doing those things
[00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:47.960]   that could be done over and over again,
[00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:49.960]   if you're watching and you're not taking that.
[00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:53.100]   But if the future is different from the past,
[00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:54.440]   and you have that, then,
[00:49:54.440 --> 00:49:56.880]   if the future is different from the past
[00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:59.080]   and you don't have deep understanding,
[00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:00.740]   you're gonna get in trouble.
[00:50:00.740 --> 00:50:03.160]   And so that's the main thing.
[00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:05.360]   As far as AI is concerned,
[00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:08.660]   AI, and let's say computer replications
[00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:09.960]   of thinking in various ways,
[00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:12.840]   I think it's particularly good for processing.
[00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:18.300]   But the notion of what you want to do
[00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:23.020]   is better most of the time determined by the human mind.
[00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:24.500]   That what are the principles?
[00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:27.540]   Like, okay, how should I raise my children?
[00:50:27.540 --> 00:50:29.980]   It's gonna be a long time before AI,
[00:50:29.980 --> 00:50:33.140]   you're going to say it has a good enough judgment to do that.
[00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:34.740]   Who should I marry?
[00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:35.620]   All of those things.
[00:50:35.620 --> 00:50:37.460]   Maybe you can get the computer to help you,
[00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:40.140]   but if you just took data and do machine learning,
[00:50:40.140 --> 00:50:41.340]   it's not gonna find it.
[00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:44.460]   If you were to then take what are my criteria
[00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:47.460]   for any of those questions,
[00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:49.740]   and then say, put them into an algorithm,
[00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:53.180]   you'd be a lot better off than if you took AI to do it.
[00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:56.980]   But by and large, the mind should be used
[00:50:56.980 --> 00:51:00.540]   for inventing and those creative things.
[00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:03.980]   And then the computer should be used for processing
[00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:06.940]   'cause it could process a lot more information,
[00:51:06.940 --> 00:51:10.260]   a lot faster, a lot more accurately,
[00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:12.220]   and a lot less emotionally.
[00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:15.140]   So any notion of thinking
[00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:17.700]   in the form of processing type thinking
[00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:19.620]   should be done by a computer.
[00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:22.220]   And anything that is in the notion of doing
[00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:23.460]   that other type of thinking
[00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:26.820]   should be operating with the brain.
[00:51:26.820 --> 00:51:31.380]   Operating in a way where you can say, ah, that makes sense.
[00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:35.340]   - The process of reducing your understanding
[00:51:35.340 --> 00:51:38.860]   down to principles is kind of like the process,
[00:51:38.860 --> 00:51:43.300]   the first one you mentioned, type of AI algorithm,
[00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:45.620]   where you're encoding your expertise.
[00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:47.940]   You're trying to program, write a program.
[00:51:47.940 --> 00:51:50.380]   The human is trying to write a program.
[00:51:50.380 --> 00:51:53.540]   How do you think that's attainable?
[00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:58.540]   The process of reducing principles to a computer program.
[00:51:58.540 --> 00:52:03.620]   Or when you say, when you write about,
[00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:05.820]   when you think about principles,
[00:52:05.820 --> 00:52:07.460]   is there still a human element
[00:52:07.460 --> 00:52:10.900]   that's not reducible to an algorithm?
[00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:17.180]   - My experience has been that almost all things,
[00:52:17.180 --> 00:52:19.580]   including those things that I thought
[00:52:19.620 --> 00:52:23.780]   were pretty much impossible to express,
[00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:27.660]   I've been able to express in algorithms.
[00:52:27.660 --> 00:52:31.140]   But that doesn't constitute all things.
[00:52:31.140 --> 00:52:36.140]   So you can, whew, you can express far more
[00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:39.420]   than you can imagine you'll be able to express.
[00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:41.900]   So I use the example of, okay, it's not,
[00:52:41.900 --> 00:52:43.940]   how do you raise your children?
[00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:48.300]   Okay, you will be able to take it one piece by piece.
[00:52:48.300 --> 00:52:51.660]   Okay, at what age, what school?
[00:52:51.660 --> 00:52:54.940]   And the way to do that, in my experience,
[00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:59.940]   is to take that, and when you're in the moment
[00:52:59.940 --> 00:53:05.020]   of making a decision, or just past making a decision,
[00:53:05.020 --> 00:53:09.060]   to take the time and to write down your criteria
[00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:11.880]   for making that decision in words.
[00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:16.380]   Okay, that way you'll get your principles down on paper.
[00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:19.860]   I created an app, online call,
[00:53:19.860 --> 00:53:23.420]   it's right now just on the iPhone, it'll be on Android.
[00:53:23.420 --> 00:53:25.340]   - I tried getting it on Android, come on, now.
[00:53:25.340 --> 00:53:26.660]   Let's get it on Android.
[00:53:26.660 --> 00:53:28.620]   - It'll be, in a few months it'll be on Android.
[00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:29.460]   - Awesome.
[00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:33.020]   - But it has an app in there that helps people
[00:53:33.020 --> 00:53:35.140]   write down their own principles.
[00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:37.160]   'Cause this is very powerful.
[00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:40.540]   So when you're in that moment where you've just,
[00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:42.060]   you're thinking about it and you're thinking
[00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:46.060]   your criteria for choosing the school for your child,
[00:53:46.060 --> 00:53:49.660]   or whatever that might be, and you write down your criteria,
[00:53:49.660 --> 00:53:52.180]   or whatever they are, those principles,
[00:53:52.180 --> 00:53:57.180]   you write down and you, that will, at that moment,
[00:53:57.180 --> 00:54:02.140]   make you articulate your principles in a very valuable way.
[00:54:02.140 --> 00:54:04.860]   And if you have the way that we operate,
[00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:07.580]   that you have easy access, so the next time
[00:54:07.580 --> 00:54:09.900]   that comes along, you can go to that,
[00:54:09.900 --> 00:54:11.980]   or you can show those principles to others
[00:54:11.980 --> 00:54:13.920]   to see if they're the right principles.
[00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:16.920]   You will get a clarity of that principle
[00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:19.060]   that's really invaluable in words,
[00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:21.100]   and that'll help you a lot.
[00:54:21.100 --> 00:54:26.020]   But then, you start to think, how do I express that in data?
[00:54:26.020 --> 00:54:29.260]   And it'll shock you about how you can do that.
[00:54:29.260 --> 00:54:33.320]   You'll form an equation that will show the relationship
[00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:36.180]   between these particular parts, and then the,
[00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:39.500]   essentially the variables that are going to go
[00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:41.540]   into that particular equation,
[00:54:41.540 --> 00:54:43.100]   and you will be able to do that.
[00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:45.140]   And you take that little piece,
[00:54:45.140 --> 00:54:48.020]   and you put it into the computer.
[00:54:48.020 --> 00:54:49.860]   And then take the next little piece,
[00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:51.940]   and you put that into the computer.
[00:54:51.940 --> 00:54:54.780]   And before you know it, you will have
[00:54:54.780 --> 00:54:57.020]   a decision-making system that's of the sort
[00:54:57.020 --> 00:54:58.100]   that I'm describing.
[00:54:58.100 --> 00:55:00.540]   - So you're almost making an argument
[00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:03.140]   against an earlier statement you've made.
[00:55:03.140 --> 00:55:05.380]   You're convincing me, at first you said,
[00:55:05.380 --> 00:55:08.880]   there's no way a computer could raise a child, essentially.
[00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:12.140]   But now you've described, making me think of it,
[00:55:12.140 --> 00:55:16.020]   if you have that kind of idea, meritocracy,
[00:55:16.020 --> 00:55:17.900]   you have this rigorous approach to bridge
[00:55:17.900 --> 00:55:21.880]   why it takes an investment, and apply it to raising a child.
[00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:24.900]   It feels like, through the process you just described,
[00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:29.140]   we could, as a society, arrive at a set of principles
[00:55:29.140 --> 00:55:33.900]   for raising a child, and encode it into a computer.
[00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:38.900]   - That originality will not come from machine learning.
[00:55:38.900 --> 00:55:42.000]   - The first time you do, so that the original,
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:43.180]   yes. - That's what I'm referring to.
[00:55:43.180 --> 00:55:45.940]   - But eventually, as we together develop it,
[00:55:45.940 --> 00:55:47.280]   and then we can automate it.
[00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:50.180]   - That's why I'm saying the processing
[00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:51.820]   can be done by the computer.
[00:55:51.820 --> 00:55:54.940]   So we're saying the same thing, we're not inconsistent.
[00:55:54.940 --> 00:55:57.620]   We're saying the same thing, that the processing
[00:55:57.620 --> 00:55:59.820]   of that information and those algorithms
[00:55:59.820 --> 00:56:03.580]   can be done by the computer in a very, very effective way.
[00:56:03.580 --> 00:56:05.300]   You don't need to sit there and process,
[00:56:05.300 --> 00:56:07.700]   and try to weigh all those things in your equation,
[00:56:07.700 --> 00:56:09.060]   and all those things.
[00:56:09.060 --> 00:56:13.820]   But that notion of, okay, how do I get at that principle?
[00:56:13.820 --> 00:56:15.700]   - And you're saying you'd be surprised
[00:56:15.700 --> 00:56:18.900]   - Yes, you can do that. - how much you can express.
[00:56:18.900 --> 00:56:19.740]   - That's right.
[00:56:19.740 --> 00:56:22.100]   You can do that.
[00:56:22.100 --> 00:56:25.920]   So this is where I think you're going to see the future.
[00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:30.980]   Right now, we go to our devices,
[00:56:30.980 --> 00:56:35.640]   and we get information, to a large extent.
[00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:39.660]   And then we get some guidance, we have our GPS and the like.
[00:56:39.660 --> 00:56:43.380]   In my opinion, principles, principles, principles,
[00:56:43.380 --> 00:56:44.960]   principles, I want to emphasize that.
[00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:48.300]   You write them down, you've got those principles.
[00:56:48.300 --> 00:56:52.700]   They will be converted into algorithms for decision making.
[00:56:52.700 --> 00:56:55.220]   And they're going to also have the benefit
[00:56:55.220 --> 00:56:57.380]   of collective decision making.
[00:56:57.380 --> 00:56:59.740]   Because right now, individuals,
[00:56:59.740 --> 00:57:01.900]   based on what's stuck in their heads,
[00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:05.180]   are making their decisions in very ignorant ways.
[00:57:05.180 --> 00:57:06.960]   They're not the best decision makers,
[00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:10.060]   they're not the best criteria, and they're operating.
[00:57:10.060 --> 00:57:12.520]   When those principles are written down,
[00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:14.840]   and converted into algorithms,
[00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:16.560]   it's almost like you'll look at that
[00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:18.240]   and follow the instructions,
[00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:20.220]   and it'll give you better results.
[00:57:20.220 --> 00:57:23.760]   Medicine will be much more like this.
[00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:25.560]   You can go to your local doctor,
[00:57:25.560 --> 00:57:27.840]   and you could ask his point of view, and whatever.
[00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:31.520]   And he's rushed, and he may not be the best doctor around.
[00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:33.480]   And you're going to go to this thing,
[00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:35.140]   and get that same information,
[00:57:35.140 --> 00:57:37.900]   or just automatically have an input in that.
[00:57:37.900 --> 00:57:39.260]   And it's going to tell you,
[00:57:39.260 --> 00:57:41.460]   okay, here's what you should go do,
[00:57:41.460 --> 00:57:44.260]   and it's going to be much better than your local doctor.
[00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:49.260]   And that, the converting of information into intelligence,
[00:57:49.260 --> 00:57:52.700]   okay, intelligence, is the thing.
[00:57:52.700 --> 00:57:55.740]   We're coming out with, again, I'm 70,
[00:57:55.740 --> 00:57:57.900]   and I want to pass all these things along.
[00:57:57.900 --> 00:58:02.260]   So, all these tools that I've found
[00:58:02.260 --> 00:58:04.940]   need to develop all over these periods of time,
[00:58:04.940 --> 00:58:07.440]   all those things, I want to make them available.
[00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:08.640]   And what's going to happen,
[00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:10.940]   as they're going to see this,
[00:58:10.940 --> 00:58:13.400]   they're going to see these tools
[00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:15.000]   operating much more that way.
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:20.000]   The idea of converting data into intelligence.
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:23.660]   Intelligence, for example, on what they are like.
[00:58:23.660 --> 00:58:25.420]   On what are your strengths and weaknesses.
[00:58:25.420 --> 00:58:28.300]   Intelligence on who do I work well with,
[00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:29.460]   under what circumstances.
[00:58:29.460 --> 00:58:31.340]   - Personalized. - Intelligence.
[00:58:31.340 --> 00:58:35.700]   We're going to go from what are called systems of record,
[00:58:35.700 --> 00:58:37.020]   which are a lot of, okay,
[00:58:37.020 --> 00:58:39.520]   information organized in the right way,
[00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:41.600]   to intelligence.
[00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:45.540]   And we're going to, that'll be the next big move,
[00:58:45.540 --> 00:58:46.660]   in my opinion.
[00:58:46.660 --> 00:58:49.900]   And so you will get intelligence back.
[00:58:49.900 --> 00:58:51.460]   - And that intelligence comes from
[00:58:51.460 --> 00:58:54.120]   reducing things down to principles and to--
[00:58:54.120 --> 00:58:55.500]   - That's how it happens.
[00:58:55.500 --> 00:58:57.220]   - So, what's your intuition,
[00:58:57.220 --> 00:58:58.900]   if we look at future societies,
[00:58:58.900 --> 00:59:02.620]   do you think we'll be able to reduce
[00:59:02.620 --> 00:59:07.300]   a lot of the details of our lives
[00:59:07.300 --> 00:59:08.820]   down to principles that would be
[00:59:08.820 --> 00:59:10.220]   further and further automated?
[00:59:10.220 --> 00:59:12.760]   - I think the real question hinges
[00:59:12.760 --> 00:59:17.760]   on people's emotions and irrational behaviors.
[00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:25.920]   I think that there's subliminal things that we want, okay?
[00:59:25.940 --> 00:59:30.020]   And then there's cerebral, conscious logic.
[00:59:30.020 --> 00:59:32.940]   And the two often are at odds.
[00:59:32.940 --> 00:59:36.700]   So there's almost like two yous in you, right?
[00:59:36.700 --> 00:59:39.540]   And so let's say, what do you want?
[00:59:39.540 --> 00:59:42.260]   Your mind will answer one thing,
[00:59:42.260 --> 00:59:44.660]   your emotions will answer something else.
[00:59:44.660 --> 00:59:47.900]   So when I think about it, I think emotions are,
[00:59:47.900 --> 00:59:52.300]   I want inspiration, I want love is a good thing,
[00:59:52.300 --> 00:59:54.020]   being able to have a good impact.
[00:59:54.020 --> 00:59:59.020]   But it is in the reconciliation of your subliminal wants
[00:59:59.020 --> 01:00:02.700]   and your intellectual wants,
[01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:05.780]   so that you really say they're aligned.
[01:00:05.780 --> 01:00:08.860]   And so to do that in a way to get what you want.
[01:00:08.860 --> 01:00:13.340]   So irrationality is a bad thing
[01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:16.460]   if it means that it doesn't make sense
[01:00:16.460 --> 01:00:18.180]   in getting you what you want,
[01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:20.180]   but you better decide which you you're satisfying.
[01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:23.380]   Is it the lower level you, emotional, subliminal one?
[01:00:23.380 --> 01:00:24.580]   Or is it the other?
[01:00:24.580 --> 01:00:26.060]   But if you can align them.
[01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:30.700]   So what I find is that by going from my,
[01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:34.740]   you experience the decision, do this thing subliminally.
[01:00:34.740 --> 01:00:35.980]   And that's the thing I want.
[01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:37.680]   It comes to the surface.
[01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:40.340]   I find that if I can align that
[01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:42.620]   with what my logical me wants
[01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:45.900]   and do the double check between them
[01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:47.900]   and I get the same sort of thing,
[01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:49.740]   that that helps me a lot.
[01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:53.060]   I find, for example, meditation is one of the things
[01:00:53.060 --> 01:00:55.180]   that helps to achieve that alignment.
[01:00:55.180 --> 01:00:58.460]   It's fantastic for achieving that alignment.
[01:00:58.460 --> 01:01:02.140]   And often then I also wanna not just do it in my head.
[01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:03.580]   I wanna say, does that make sense?
[01:01:03.580 --> 01:01:06.220]   Help you, and so I do it with other people.
[01:01:06.220 --> 01:01:08.580]   And I say, okay, well, let's say I want this thing
[01:01:08.580 --> 01:01:10.700]   and whatever, does that make sense?
[01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:13.580]   And when you do that kind of triangulation,
[01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:17.820]   your two yous, and you do that with also the other way,
[01:01:17.820 --> 01:01:21.220]   then you certainly wanna be rational, right?
[01:01:21.220 --> 01:01:24.600]   But rationality has to be defined by those things.
[01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:28.740]   - And then you discover sort of new ideas
[01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:30.780]   that drive your future.
[01:01:30.780 --> 01:01:32.660]   So you're always at the edge
[01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:34.340]   of the set of principles you've developed.
[01:01:34.340 --> 01:01:35.940]   You're doing new things always.
[01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:36.780]   - Right. - So that's where
[01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:38.300]   the intellect is needed.
[01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:40.580]   - Well, and the inspiration.
[01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:43.580]   The inspiration is needed to do that, right?
[01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:45.260]   Like, what are you doing it for?
[01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:46.940]   It's the excitement. - So what is that thing?
[01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:47.980]   What is that thing? - The adventure,
[01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:49.780]   the curiosity, the hunger.
[01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:52.740]   What's, if you can be Freud for a second,
[01:01:52.740 --> 01:01:55.020]   what's in that subconscious?
[01:01:55.020 --> 01:01:57.020]   What's the thing that drives us?
[01:01:57.020 --> 01:02:00.020]   - I think you can't generalize of us.
[01:02:00.020 --> 01:02:02.620]   I think different people are driven by different things.
[01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:04.800]   There's not a common one, right?
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:07.980]   So like if you would take the shapers,
[01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:12.980]   I think it is a combination of subliminally,
[01:02:12.980 --> 01:02:18.020]   it's a combination of excitement, curiosity.
[01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:19.980]   - Is there a dark element there?
[01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:21.820]   Is there demons?
[01:02:21.820 --> 01:02:22.840]   Is there fears?
[01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:24.580]   Is there, in your sense,
[01:02:24.580 --> 01:02:25.980]   something dark that drives them?
[01:02:25.980 --> 01:02:27.940]   - Most of the ones that I'm dealing with,
[01:02:27.940 --> 01:02:29.780]   I have not seen that.
[01:02:29.780 --> 01:02:33.260]   I see the, what I really see is,
[01:02:33.260 --> 01:02:37.700]   whoo, if I can do that, that would be the most dream.
[01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:41.380]   And then the act of creativity, and you say, ooh.
[01:02:41.380 --> 01:02:44.180]   So excitement is one of the things.
[01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:47.940]   Curiosity is a big pull, okay?
[01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:51.780]   And then tenacity, okay, to do those things.
[01:02:51.780 --> 01:02:55.380]   But definitely, emotions are entering into it.
[01:02:55.380 --> 01:02:58.780]   Then there's an intellectual component of it too, okay?
[01:02:58.780 --> 01:03:01.140]   It may be empathy.
[01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:02.780]   Can I have an impact?
[01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:04.060]   Can I have an impact?
[01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:08.300]   The desire to have an impact, that's an emotional thrill,
[01:03:08.300 --> 01:03:10.300]   but it also has empathy.
[01:03:10.300 --> 01:03:12.820]   And then you start to see spirituality.
[01:03:12.820 --> 01:03:16.020]   By the spirituality, I mean the connectedness to the whole.
[01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:18.380]   You start to see people operate those things.
[01:03:18.380 --> 01:03:21.460]   Those tend to be the things that you see the most of.
[01:03:21.460 --> 01:03:25.540]   - And I think you're gonna shut down this idea completely,
[01:03:25.540 --> 01:03:29.600]   but there's a notion that some of these shapers
[01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:33.540]   really walk the line between sort of madness and genius.
[01:03:33.540 --> 01:03:37.000]   Do you think madness has a role in any of this?
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:40.300]   Or do you still see Steve Jobs and Elon Musk
[01:03:40.300 --> 01:03:42.220]   as fundamentally rational?
[01:03:42.220 --> 01:03:43.980]   - Yeah, there's a continuum there.
[01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:48.980]   And what comes to my mind is that genius
[01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:53.940]   is often at the edge, in some cases,
[01:03:53.940 --> 01:03:58.940]   imaginary genius is at the edge of insanity.
[01:03:58.940 --> 01:04:02.860]   And it's almost like a radio that I think,
[01:04:02.860 --> 01:04:06.740]   okay, if I can tune it just right, it's playing right,
[01:04:06.740 --> 01:04:11.740]   but if I go a little bit too far, it goes off, okay?
[01:04:11.900 --> 01:04:14.740]   And so you can see this.
[01:04:14.740 --> 01:04:17.380]   Kay Jamison was studying bipolar.
[01:04:17.380 --> 01:04:22.000]   What it shows is that that's definitely the case,
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.620]   'cause when you're going out there,
[01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:25.460]   that imagination, whatever,
[01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:29.020]   can be near the edge sometimes.
[01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:31.260]   Doesn't have to always be.
[01:04:31.260 --> 01:04:33.780]   - So let me ask you about automation.
[01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:37.220]   That's been a part of public discourse recently.
[01:04:37.220 --> 01:04:40.980]   What's your view on the impact of automation
[01:04:41.820 --> 01:04:44.260]   of whether we're talking about AI
[01:04:44.260 --> 01:04:46.940]   or more basic forms of automation on the economy
[01:04:46.940 --> 01:04:49.140]   in the short term and the long term?
[01:04:49.140 --> 01:04:52.740]   Do you have concerns about it, as some do,
[01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:55.380]   or do you think it's overblown?
[01:04:55.380 --> 01:04:56.220]   - It's not overblown.
[01:04:56.220 --> 01:04:57.500]   I mean, it's a giant thing.
[01:04:57.500 --> 01:05:01.300]   It'll come at us in a very big way in the future.
[01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:04.420]   We're right at the edge of even really accelerating it.
[01:05:04.420 --> 01:05:07.740]   It's had a big impact, and it will have a big impact.
[01:05:07.740 --> 01:05:09.420]   And it's a two-edged sword,
[01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:14.420]   because it'll have tremendous benefits,
[01:05:14.420 --> 01:05:18.580]   and at the same time, it has profound benefits
[01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:21.420]   in employment and distributions of wealth,
[01:05:21.420 --> 01:05:25.180]   because the way I think about it is
[01:05:25.180 --> 01:05:27.540]   there are certain things human beings can do,
[01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:32.340]   and over time, we've evolved to go to
[01:05:32.340 --> 01:05:34.380]   almost higher and higher levels,
[01:05:34.380 --> 01:05:37.300]   and now we're almost like we're at this level.
[01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:41.420]   It used to be your labor, and you would then do your labor,
[01:05:41.420 --> 01:05:42.980]   and okay, we can get past the labor.
[01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:46.220]   We got tractors and things, and you go up, up, up, up, up,
[01:05:46.220 --> 01:05:50.020]   and we're up over here, and up to the point in our minds
[01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:55.020]   where, okay, anything related to mental processing,
[01:05:55.020 --> 01:05:58.580]   the computer can probably do better, and we can find that.
[01:05:58.580 --> 01:06:01.940]   And so other than almost inventing,
[01:06:01.940 --> 01:06:05.460]   you're at a point where the machines
[01:06:05.860 --> 01:06:09.700]   and the automation will probably do it better,
[01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:12.860]   and that's accelerating, and that's a force,
[01:06:12.860 --> 01:06:15.540]   and that's a force for the good,
[01:06:15.540 --> 01:06:20.540]   and at the same time, what it does is it displaces people
[01:06:20.540 --> 01:06:22.860]   in terms of employment and changes,
[01:06:22.860 --> 01:06:25.300]   and it produces wealth gaps and all of that.
[01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:29.340]   So I think the real issue is that that has to be viewed
[01:06:29.340 --> 01:06:32.180]   as a national emergency.
[01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:34.820]   In other words, I think the wealth gap,
[01:06:34.820 --> 01:06:39.260]   the income gap, the opportunity gap, all of those things,
[01:06:39.260 --> 01:06:42.980]   that force is creating the problems
[01:06:42.980 --> 01:06:45.540]   that we're having today, a lot of the problems,
[01:06:45.540 --> 01:06:49.060]   the great polarity, the disenfranchised,
[01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:54.780]   not anything approaching equality of education,
[01:06:54.780 --> 01:06:57.620]   all of these problems, a lot of problems
[01:06:57.620 --> 01:06:59.660]   are coming as a result of that,
[01:06:59.660 --> 01:07:02.540]   and so it needs to be viewed, really,
[01:07:02.540 --> 01:07:07.540]   as an emergency situation in which there's a good work,
[01:07:07.540 --> 01:07:13.420]   good plan worked out for how to deal with that effectively
[01:07:13.420 --> 01:07:17.540]   so that it's dealt with effectively.
[01:07:17.540 --> 01:07:21.620]   Because it's good for the average,
[01:07:21.620 --> 01:07:24.460]   it's good for the impact, but it's not good for everyone,
[01:07:24.460 --> 01:07:27.820]   and it creates that polarity, so it's gotta be dealt with.
[01:07:27.820 --> 01:07:30.020]   - Yeah, and you've talked about the American dream,
[01:07:30.020 --> 01:07:32.740]   and that that's something that all people
[01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:34.100]   should have an opportunity for,
[01:07:34.100 --> 01:07:36.700]   and that we need to reform capitalism
[01:07:36.700 --> 01:07:39.380]   to give that opportunity for everyone.
[01:07:39.380 --> 01:07:44.380]   Let me ask on one of the ideas in terms of safety nets
[01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:47.860]   that support that kind of opportunity.
[01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:49.060]   There's been a lot of discussion
[01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:51.780]   of universal basic income amongst people,
[01:07:51.780 --> 01:07:55.180]   so there's Andrew Yang, who's running on that,
[01:07:55.180 --> 01:07:57.860]   he's a political candidate running for president,
[01:07:57.860 --> 01:08:00.460]   on the idea of universal basic income.
[01:08:00.460 --> 01:08:01.860]   What do you think about that,
[01:08:01.860 --> 01:08:05.620]   giving $1,000 or some amount of money to everybody
[01:08:05.620 --> 01:08:09.300]   as a way to give them the padding,
[01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:12.340]   the freedom to sort of take leaps,
[01:08:12.340 --> 01:08:14.180]   to take the call for adventure,
[01:08:14.180 --> 01:08:16.740]   to take the crazy pursuits?
[01:08:16.740 --> 01:08:19.140]   - Before I get right into my thoughts
[01:08:19.140 --> 01:08:20.460]   on universal basic income,
[01:08:20.460 --> 01:08:25.460]   I wanna start with the notion that opportunity,
[01:08:26.740 --> 01:08:31.740]   education, development, creating equality,
[01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:36.220]   so that people say there's equal opportunity,
[01:08:36.220 --> 01:08:39.720]   and is the most important thing,
[01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:43.080]   and then to find out what is the amount,
[01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:45.020]   how are you going to provide that,
[01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:50.260]   how do you get the money into a public school system,
[01:08:50.260 --> 01:08:52.380]   how do you get the teaching,
[01:08:52.380 --> 01:08:57.380]   the fleshing out that plan to create equal opportunity
[01:08:57.380 --> 01:09:02.660]   in all of its various forms is the most pressing thing to do,
[01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:06.220]   and so that is that.
[01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:08.320]   - The opportunity, the most important one
[01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:11.420]   you're kind of implying is the earlier the better,
[01:09:11.420 --> 01:09:14.440]   sort of like opportunity to education,
[01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:17.780]   so in the early development of a human being
[01:09:17.780 --> 01:09:20.060]   is when you should have the equal opportunities,
[01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:21.060]   that's the most important.
[01:09:21.060 --> 01:09:24.220]   - Right, in the first phase of your life,
[01:09:24.220 --> 01:09:27.820]   which goes from birth until you're on your own,
[01:09:27.820 --> 01:09:30.520]   and you're an adult and you're now out there,
[01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:34.660]   and you deal with early childhood development,
[01:09:34.660 --> 01:09:38.020]   and you take the brain, and you say what's important?
[01:09:38.020 --> 01:09:42.660]   The child care, it makes a world of difference,
[01:09:42.660 --> 01:09:44.700]   for example, if you have good parents
[01:09:44.700 --> 01:09:48.740]   who are trying to think about instilling the stability
[01:09:48.740 --> 01:09:52.060]   in a non-traumatic environment to provide them,
[01:09:52.060 --> 01:09:53.760]   so I would say the good guidance
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:55.820]   that normally comes from parents,
[01:09:55.820 --> 01:09:59.500]   and the good education that they're receiving
[01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:06.180]   are the most important things in that person's development.
[01:10:06.180 --> 01:10:10.380]   The ability to be able to be prepared to go out there,
[01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:12.780]   and then to go into a market
[01:10:12.780 --> 01:10:15.860]   that's an equal opportunity job market,
[01:10:15.860 --> 01:10:19.020]   to be able to then go into that kind of market
[01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:22.780]   is a system that creates not only fairness,
[01:10:22.780 --> 01:10:24.980]   anything else is not fair,
[01:10:24.980 --> 01:10:27.140]   and then in addition to that,
[01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:30.420]   it also is a more effective economic system,
[01:10:30.420 --> 01:10:33.720]   because the consequences of not doing that
[01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:35.740]   to a society are devastating.
[01:10:35.740 --> 01:10:38.580]   If you look at what the difference in outcomes
[01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:40.940]   for somebody who completes high school
[01:10:40.940 --> 01:10:42.540]   or doesn't complete high school,
[01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:45.860]   or does each one of those state changes,
[01:10:45.860 --> 01:10:47.780]   and you look at what that means
[01:10:47.780 --> 01:10:50.660]   in terms of their costs to society,
[01:10:50.660 --> 01:10:54.700]   not only themselves, but their cost in incarceration costs,
[01:10:54.700 --> 01:10:57.500]   and crimes, and all of those things,
[01:10:57.500 --> 01:11:00.740]   it's economically better for the society,
[01:11:00.740 --> 01:11:05.740]   and it's fairer if they can get those particular things.
[01:11:05.740 --> 01:11:07.760]   Once they have those things,
[01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:09.260]   then you move on to other things,
[01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:13.180]   but yes, from birth all the way through that process,
[01:11:13.180 --> 01:11:16.820]   anything less than that is bad,
[01:11:16.820 --> 01:11:18.940]   is a tragedy, and so on.
[01:11:18.940 --> 01:11:20.420]   So that's what I, yeah,
[01:11:20.420 --> 01:11:22.260]   those are the things that I'm estimating.
[01:11:22.260 --> 01:11:25.900]   And so my, what I would want above all else
[01:11:25.900 --> 01:11:27.420]   is to provide that.
[01:11:27.420 --> 01:11:28.780]   So with that in mind,
[01:11:28.780 --> 01:11:30.900]   now we'll talk about universal basic income.
[01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:32.820]   - Start with that, now we can talk about--
[01:11:32.820 --> 01:11:34.940]   - Well, right, because you have to have that.
[01:11:34.940 --> 01:11:38.260]   Now the question is what's the best way to provide that?
[01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:41.380]   Okay, so when I look at UBI,
[01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:43.900]   I really think is what is going to happen
[01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:46.300]   with that $1,000, okay?
[01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:50.540]   And will that $1,000 come from another program?
[01:11:50.540 --> 01:11:54.220]   Does that come from an early childhood developmental program?
[01:11:54.220 --> 01:11:57.180]   Who are you giving the $1,000 to,
[01:11:57.180 --> 01:11:59.700]   and what will they do for that $1,000?
[01:11:59.700 --> 01:12:01.900]   I mean, like my reaction would be,
[01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:03.220]   I think it's a great thing
[01:12:03.220 --> 01:12:06.940]   that everybody should have almost $1,000 in their bank,
[01:12:06.940 --> 01:12:07.780]   and so on.
[01:12:07.780 --> 01:12:09.620]   But when do they get to make decisions,
[01:12:09.620 --> 01:12:10.700]   or who's the parent?
[01:12:10.700 --> 01:12:14.020]   A lot of times you can give $1,000 to somebody,
[01:12:14.020 --> 01:12:15.780]   and it could have a negative result.
[01:12:15.780 --> 01:12:16.820]   It can have, you know,
[01:12:16.820 --> 01:12:19.340]   they can use that money detrimentally,
[01:12:19.340 --> 01:12:21.100]   not just productively.
[01:12:21.100 --> 01:12:22.940]   And if that money's coming away
[01:12:22.940 --> 01:12:24.500]   from some of those other things
[01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:26.460]   that are gonna produce the things I want,
[01:12:26.460 --> 01:12:28.340]   and you're shifted to,
[01:12:28.340 --> 01:12:30.420]   let's say, to come in and give a check,
[01:12:30.420 --> 01:12:32.580]   doesn't mean its outcomes are going to be good
[01:12:32.580 --> 01:12:33.740]   in providing those things
[01:12:33.740 --> 01:12:36.540]   that I think are so fundamental important.
[01:12:36.540 --> 01:12:39.580]   If it was just everybody can have $1,000 and use it,
[01:12:39.580 --> 01:12:40.420]   so when the time comes--
[01:12:40.420 --> 01:12:41.940]   >> Use it well, right. >> And use it well,
[01:12:41.940 --> 01:12:44.260]   that would be really, really good,
[01:12:44.260 --> 01:12:46.620]   because it's almost like everybody,
[01:12:46.620 --> 01:12:48.740]   you'd wish everybody could have $1,000 worth
[01:12:48.740 --> 01:12:51.660]   of wiggle room in their lives, okay?
[01:12:51.660 --> 01:12:54.180]   And I think that would be great.
[01:12:54.180 --> 01:12:55.040]   I love that.
[01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:58.380]   But I wanna make sure that these other things
[01:12:58.380 --> 01:12:59.420]   that are taken care of,
[01:12:59.420 --> 01:13:01.380]   so if it comes out of that budget,
[01:13:01.380 --> 01:13:04.140]   and you know, I don't want it to come out of that budget,
[01:13:04.140 --> 01:13:05.980]   that's gonna be doing those things,
[01:13:05.980 --> 01:13:08.900]   and so you have to figure it out.
[01:13:08.900 --> 01:13:10.540]   >> And you have a certain skepticism
[01:13:10.540 --> 01:13:14.020]   that human nature will use,
[01:13:14.020 --> 01:13:17.460]   may not always, in fact, frequently may not use
[01:13:17.460 --> 01:13:19.680]   that $1,000 for the optimal,
[01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:21.980]   to support the optimal trajectory--
[01:13:21.980 --> 01:13:23.800]   >> Some will and some won't.
[01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:27.380]   One of the advantages of universal basic income
[01:13:27.380 --> 01:13:29.660]   is that if you put it in the hands,
[01:13:29.660 --> 01:13:32.420]   let's say, of parents who know how to do the right things
[01:13:32.420 --> 01:13:34.940]   and make the right choices for their children,
[01:13:34.940 --> 01:13:36.100]   'cause they're responsible,
[01:13:36.100 --> 01:13:38.860]   and you say, "I'm gonna give them $1,000 wiggle room
[01:13:38.860 --> 01:13:41.460]   "to use for the benefit of their children."
[01:13:41.460 --> 01:13:43.300]   Wow, that sounds great.
[01:13:43.300 --> 01:13:46.380]   If you put it in the hands of, let's say,
[01:13:46.380 --> 01:13:49.700]   an alcoholic or drug-addicted parent
[01:13:49.700 --> 01:13:53.860]   who is not making those choices well for their children,
[01:13:53.860 --> 01:13:56.340]   and what they do is they take that $1,000
[01:13:56.340 --> 01:13:58.100]   and they don't use it well,
[01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:01.040]   then that's gonna produce more harm than good.
[01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:03.820]   >> Well, Put, you're, if I may say so,
[01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:05.780]   one of the richest people in the world,
[01:14:05.780 --> 01:14:11.300]   so you're a good person to ask, does money buy happiness?
[01:14:11.300 --> 01:14:16.300]   >> No, it's been shown that once you get over
[01:14:16.300 --> 01:14:18.800]   a basic level of income,
[01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:22.420]   so that you can take care of the pain,
[01:14:22.420 --> 01:14:24.220]   you can, health and whatever,
[01:14:24.220 --> 01:14:28.100]   there's no correlation between the level of happiness
[01:14:28.100 --> 01:14:31.460]   that one has and the level of money that one has.
[01:14:32.620 --> 01:14:35.820]   That thing that has the highest correlation
[01:14:35.820 --> 01:14:39.720]   is quality relationships with others' community.
[01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:41.780]   If you look at surveys of these things
[01:14:41.780 --> 01:14:44.780]   across all surveys in all societies,
[01:14:44.780 --> 01:14:49.700]   it's a sense of community and interpersonal relationships.
[01:14:49.700 --> 01:14:52.640]   That is not in any way correlated with money.
[01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:57.360]   You can go down to native tribes in very poor places,
[01:14:57.360 --> 01:15:00.520]   or you can go in all different communities,
[01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:03.220]   and so they have the opportunity to have that.
[01:15:03.220 --> 01:15:07.020]   I'm very lucky in that I started with nothing,
[01:15:07.020 --> 01:15:08.340]   so I had the full range.
[01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:11.200]   I can tell you, by not having money,
[01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:13.940]   and then having quite a lot of money,
[01:15:13.940 --> 01:15:16.060]   and I did that in the right order.
[01:15:16.060 --> 01:15:17.900]   >> So you started from nothing in Long Island.
[01:15:17.900 --> 01:15:20.660]   >> Yeah, and my dad was a jazz musician,
[01:15:20.660 --> 01:15:23.220]   but I had all really that I needed,
[01:15:23.220 --> 01:15:25.820]   because I had two parents who loved me
[01:15:25.820 --> 01:15:27.340]   and took good care of me,
[01:15:27.340 --> 01:15:28.940]   and I went to a public school
[01:15:28.940 --> 01:15:30.760]   that was a good public school,
[01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:34.080]   and basically, you don't need much more than that
[01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:36.940]   in order to, that's the equal opportunity part.
[01:15:36.940 --> 01:15:40.740]   Anyway, what I'm saying is, I experienced the range,
[01:15:40.740 --> 01:15:44.620]   and there are many studies on the answer to your question.
[01:15:44.620 --> 01:15:46.820]   No, money does not bring happiness.
[01:15:46.820 --> 01:15:52.580]   Money gives you an ability to make choices.
[01:15:52.580 --> 01:15:57.540]   >> Does it get in the way, in any way,
[01:15:57.540 --> 01:16:00.580]   of forming those deep, meaningful relationships?
[01:16:00.580 --> 01:16:01.580]   >> It can.
[01:16:01.580 --> 01:16:03.340]   There are lots of ways that it makes negative.
[01:16:03.340 --> 01:16:04.460]   That's one of them.
[01:16:04.460 --> 01:16:08.500]   It could stand in the way of that, yes, okay,
[01:16:08.500 --> 01:16:11.740]   but I could almost list the ways that it could stand,
[01:16:11.740 --> 01:16:13.300]   it could be a problem.
[01:16:13.300 --> 01:16:15.420]   >> What does it buy?
[01:16:15.420 --> 01:16:19.580]   So if you can elaborate, you mentioned a bit of freedom.
[01:16:19.580 --> 01:16:21.420]   >> At the most fundamental level,
[01:16:21.420 --> 01:16:23.420]   it doesn't take a whole lot,
[01:16:23.420 --> 01:16:25.860]   but it takes enough that
[01:16:26.700 --> 01:16:31.500]   you can take care of yourself and your family
[01:16:31.500 --> 01:16:36.500]   to be able to learn, do the basics,
[01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:41.780]   have the relationships, have healthcare,
[01:16:41.780 --> 01:16:44.500]   the basics of those types of things.
[01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:46.580]   You can cover the patients,
[01:16:46.580 --> 01:16:50.300]   and then to have maybe enough security,
[01:16:50.300 --> 01:16:52.340]   but maybe not too much security.
[01:16:52.340 --> 01:16:53.420]   >> That's right, yeah.
[01:16:53.420 --> 01:16:57.740]   >> That you essentially are okay.
[01:16:57.740 --> 01:17:00.660]   Okay, that's really good.
[01:17:00.660 --> 01:17:04.140]   And you don't, that's what money will get you.
[01:17:04.140 --> 01:17:06.540]   >> And everything else could go either way.
[01:17:06.540 --> 01:17:07.940]   There's no correlation. >> Well, no, there's more.
[01:17:07.940 --> 01:17:08.780]   >> There's more.
[01:17:08.780 --> 01:17:13.460]   >> Okay, then beyond that, what it then starts to do,
[01:17:13.460 --> 01:17:15.100]   that's the most important thing.
[01:17:15.100 --> 01:17:17.980]   But beyond that, what it starts to do
[01:17:17.980 --> 01:17:22.820]   is to help to make your dreams happen in various ways.
[01:17:22.820 --> 01:17:27.500]   Okay, so for example, like in my case,
[01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:32.100]   those dreams might not be just my own dreams,
[01:17:32.100 --> 01:17:35.740]   they're impact on others' dreams, okay?
[01:17:35.740 --> 01:17:39.900]   So my own dreams might be,
[01:17:39.900 --> 01:17:42.580]   I don't know, I can pass along these,
[01:17:42.580 --> 01:17:43.620]   at my stage in life,
[01:17:43.620 --> 01:17:45.340]   I can pass along these principles to you,
[01:17:45.340 --> 01:17:46.860]   and I can give those things,
[01:17:46.860 --> 01:17:51.860]   or I can do whatever, I can go on an adventure,
[01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:56.900]   I can start a business, I can do those other things,
[01:17:56.900 --> 01:18:00.100]   be productive, I can self-actualize
[01:18:00.100 --> 01:18:04.260]   in ways that might be not possible otherwise.
[01:18:04.260 --> 01:18:08.020]   That's my own belief.
[01:18:08.020 --> 01:18:10.940]   And then I can also help others.
[01:18:10.940 --> 01:18:12.740]   I mean, this is, to the extent,
[01:18:12.740 --> 01:18:15.420]   when you get older, and with time, and whatever,
[01:18:15.420 --> 01:18:18.820]   you start to feel connected, spirituality,
[01:18:18.820 --> 01:18:19.960]   that's what I'm referring to,
[01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:21.860]   you can start to have an effect on others,
[01:18:21.860 --> 01:18:24.500]   it's beneficial, and so on, gives you the ability.
[01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:29.100]   I could tell you that people who are very wealthy,
[01:18:29.100 --> 01:18:32.340]   who have that, feel that they don't have enough money.
[01:18:32.340 --> 01:18:35.180]   Bill Gates will feel almost broke,
[01:18:35.180 --> 01:18:39.020]   because relative to the things he'd like to accomplish,
[01:18:39.020 --> 01:18:41.740]   through the Gates Foundation and things like that,
[01:18:41.740 --> 01:18:44.160]   you know, oh my God, he doesn't have enough money
[01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:46.420]   to accomplish the things he wishes for.
[01:18:46.420 --> 01:18:48.940]   But those things are not,
[01:18:48.940 --> 01:18:51.580]   you know, they're not the most fundamental things.
[01:18:51.580 --> 01:18:56.260]   So I think that people sometimes think money has value.
[01:18:56.260 --> 01:18:58.460]   Money doesn't have value.
[01:18:58.460 --> 01:19:01.500]   Money is, like you say, just a medium of exchange
[01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:02.940]   at a store, all the while.
[01:19:02.940 --> 01:19:05.020]   And so what you have to say is,
[01:19:05.020 --> 01:19:07.380]   what is it that you're going to buy?
[01:19:07.380 --> 01:19:10.100]   Now, there are other people who get their gratification
[01:19:10.100 --> 01:19:12.460]   in ways that are different from me,
[01:19:12.460 --> 01:19:14.620]   but I think in many cases,
[01:19:14.620 --> 01:19:18.860]   let's say somebody who used money to have a status symbol.
[01:19:18.860 --> 01:19:22.260]   What would I say, or that's probably unhealthy.
[01:19:22.260 --> 01:19:25.140]   But then, I don't know, somebody who says,
[01:19:25.140 --> 01:19:28.140]   I love a great, gorgeous painting,
[01:19:28.140 --> 01:19:29.980]   and it's gonna cost lots of money.
[01:19:29.980 --> 01:19:33.900]   In my priorities, I can't get there.
[01:19:33.900 --> 01:19:38.540]   But that doesn't mean, who am I to judge others
[01:19:38.540 --> 01:19:41.100]   in terms of, let's say, their element of the freedom
[01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:42.200]   to do those things.
[01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:43.940]   So it's a little bit complicated.
[01:19:43.940 --> 01:19:48.780]   But by and large, that's my view on money and wealth.
[01:19:48.780 --> 01:19:53.780]   - So let me ask you in terms of the idea of,
[01:19:53.780 --> 01:19:56.660]   so much of your passions in life has been
[01:19:56.660 --> 01:19:59.900]   through something you might be able to call work.
[01:19:59.900 --> 01:20:02.020]   Alan Watts has this quote.
[01:20:02.020 --> 01:20:06.460]   He said that the real key to life, secret to life,
[01:20:06.460 --> 01:20:08.980]   is to be completely engaged with what you're doing
[01:20:08.980 --> 01:20:10.620]   in the here and now.
[01:20:10.620 --> 01:20:13.360]   And instead of calling it work, realize it is play.
[01:20:13.360 --> 01:20:17.960]   So I'd like to ask, what is the role of work
[01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:21.660]   in your life's journey, or in a life's journey?
[01:20:21.660 --> 01:20:24.060]   And what do you think about this modern idea
[01:20:24.060 --> 01:20:28.120]   of kind of separating work and work-life balance?
[01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:31.240]   - I have a principle that I believe in is,
[01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:34.100]   make your work and your passion the same thing.
[01:20:34.100 --> 01:20:37.260]   Okay, so that's similar view.
[01:20:37.260 --> 01:20:40.400]   In other words, if you can make your work and your passion,
[01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:42.020]   it's just gonna work out great.
[01:20:42.020 --> 01:20:45.900]   And then, of course, people have different purposes of work.
[01:20:45.900 --> 01:20:48.680]   And I don't wanna be theoretical about that.
[01:20:48.680 --> 01:20:51.040]   People have to take care of their family.
[01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:56.040]   So money, at a certain point, is an important component
[01:20:56.040 --> 01:20:58.920]   of that work, so you look beyond that.
[01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:00.240]   What is the money gonna get you,
[01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:02.100]   and what are you trying to achieve?
[01:21:02.100 --> 01:21:04.840]   But the most important thing, I agree,
[01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:07.680]   is meaningful work and meaningful relationships.
[01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:10.400]   Like, if you can get into the thing that you're,
[01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:13.760]   your mission that you're on, and you are excited
[01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:15.840]   about that mission that you're on,
[01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:18.420]   and then you can do that with people
[01:21:18.420 --> 01:21:21.960]   who you have the meaningful relationships with,
[01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:25.340]   you have meaningful work and meaningful relationships,
[01:21:25.340 --> 01:21:29.000]   I mean, that is fabulous for most people.
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:34.660]   - And it seems that many people struggle to get there,
[01:21:34.660 --> 01:21:39.020]   not out of, not necessarily because they're constrained
[01:21:39.020 --> 01:21:41.280]   by the fact that they have the financial constraints
[01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:45.780]   of having to provide for their family and so on,
[01:21:45.780 --> 01:21:50.100]   but it's, I mean, you know, this idea's out there
[01:21:50.100 --> 01:21:51.880]   that there needs to be a work-life balance,
[01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:53.780]   which means that most people,
[01:21:53.780 --> 01:21:55.580]   and we're gonna return to the same thing,
[01:21:55.580 --> 01:21:57.820]   is most doesn't mean optimal,
[01:21:57.820 --> 01:22:01.940]   but most people seem to not be doing their life's passion,
[01:22:01.940 --> 01:22:04.940]   not be, not unifying work and passion.
[01:22:04.940 --> 01:22:06.260]   Why do you think that is?
[01:22:06.260 --> 01:22:08.780]   - Well, the work-life balance,
[01:22:08.780 --> 01:22:11.980]   there's a life arc that you go through.
[01:22:12.900 --> 01:22:17.900]   Starts at zero and ends somewhere in the vicinity of 80,
[01:22:17.900 --> 01:22:19.860]   and there is a phase, and there's a,
[01:22:19.860 --> 01:22:22.300]   and you could look at the different degrees of happiness
[01:22:22.300 --> 01:22:24.780]   that happen in those phases, I can go through that
[01:22:24.780 --> 01:22:25.620]   if that was interesting,
[01:22:25.620 --> 01:22:27.640]   but we don't have time probably for it.
[01:22:27.640 --> 01:22:30.200]   But you get in the part of the life,
[01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:34.340]   that part of the life which has the lowest level
[01:22:34.340 --> 01:22:38.620]   of happiness is age 45 to 55,
[01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:43.620]   and because as you move into this second phase of your life,
[01:22:43.620 --> 01:22:46.420]   now the first phase of your life
[01:22:46.420 --> 01:22:48.980]   is when you're learning dependent on others.
[01:22:48.980 --> 01:22:51.740]   Second phase of your life is when you're working
[01:22:51.740 --> 01:22:53.500]   and others are dependent on you,
[01:22:53.500 --> 01:22:55.600]   and you're trying to be successful.
[01:22:55.600 --> 01:22:58.140]   And in that phase of one's life,
[01:22:58.140 --> 01:23:01.460]   you encounter the work-life balance challenge
[01:23:01.460 --> 01:23:04.040]   because you're trying to be successful at work
[01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:07.300]   and successful at parenting and successful and successful
[01:23:07.300 --> 01:23:10.140]   and all those things that take your demand.
[01:23:10.140 --> 01:23:13.620]   And they get into that, and I understand that problem
[01:23:13.620 --> 01:23:15.380]   in the work-life balance.
[01:23:15.380 --> 01:23:20.140]   The issue is primarily to know how to approach that, okay?
[01:23:20.140 --> 01:23:24.220]   So I understand it's stressful, it produces stress,
[01:23:24.220 --> 01:23:25.740]   and it produces bad results,
[01:23:25.740 --> 01:23:29.180]   and it produces the lowest level of happiness in one's life.
[01:23:29.180 --> 01:23:31.940]   It's interesting, as you get later in life,
[01:23:31.940 --> 01:23:33.780]   the levels of happiness rise,
[01:23:33.780 --> 01:23:35.900]   and the highest level of happiness
[01:23:35.900 --> 01:23:37.660]   is between ages 70 and 80,
[01:23:37.660 --> 01:23:39.420]   which is interesting for other reasons.
[01:23:39.420 --> 01:23:44.420]   But in that spot, and the key to work-life balance
[01:23:44.420 --> 01:23:48.980]   is to realize and to learn
[01:23:48.980 --> 01:23:53.740]   how to get more out of an hour of life, okay?
[01:23:53.740 --> 01:23:56.820]   Because an hour of work,
[01:23:56.820 --> 01:24:00.540]   what people are thinking is that they have to make a choice
[01:24:00.540 --> 01:24:04.720]   between one thing and another, and of course they do,
[01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:08.300]   but they don't realize that if they develop the skill
[01:24:08.300 --> 01:24:11.320]   to get a lot more out of an hour,
[01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:14.660]   it's the equivalent of having many more hours in your life.
[01:24:14.660 --> 01:24:17.460]   And so, that's why in the book "Principles"
[01:24:17.460 --> 01:24:21.060]   I try to go into, okay, now how can you get a lot more
[01:24:21.060 --> 01:24:25.080]   out of an hour that allows you to get more life
[01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:28.020]   into your life, and it reduces the work-life balance.
[01:24:28.020 --> 01:24:31.400]   - And that's the primary struggle in that 35 to 45.
[01:24:32.900 --> 01:24:35.140]   If you could linger on that,
[01:24:35.140 --> 01:24:37.860]   so what are the ups and downs of life
[01:24:37.860 --> 01:24:39.960]   in terms of happiness in general,
[01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:42.960]   and perhaps in your own life
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:46.580]   when you look back at the moments, the peaks?
[01:24:46.580 --> 01:24:50.040]   - It's pretty much the same pattern.
[01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:54.400]   Really in one's life tends to be a very happy period
[01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:58.640]   all the way up, and 16 is like a really great happy,
[01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:00.920]   you know, I think, like myself,
[01:25:00.920 --> 01:25:03.400]   you start to get elements of freedom,
[01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:07.660]   you get your driver's license, whatever, but 16 is there.
[01:25:07.660 --> 01:25:10.560]   Junior year in high school quite often
[01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:12.520]   could be a stressful period to try to get things
[01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:13.760]   about the high school.
[01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:17.280]   You go into college, tends to be very high happiness,
[01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:18.440]   generally speaking.
[01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:19.280]   - Freedom.
[01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:21.960]   - And then freedom, yeah, friendships,
[01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:24.200]   all of that freedom is a big thing.
[01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:29.200]   And then 23 is a peak point kind of in happiness.
[01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:31.640]   That freedom.
[01:25:31.640 --> 01:25:34.960]   Then sequentially one has a great time,
[01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:36.560]   they date, they go out, and so on,
[01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:38.900]   you find the love of your life,
[01:25:38.900 --> 01:25:41.540]   you begin to develop a family,
[01:25:41.540 --> 01:25:44.400]   and then with that as time happens,
[01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:48.000]   you have more of your work-life balance challenges
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.280]   that come and your responsibilities,
[01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:53.880]   and then as you get there in that mid part of your life,
[01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:56.480]   that is the biggest struggle.
[01:25:56.480 --> 01:25:59.720]   Chances are you will crash in that period of time.
[01:25:59.720 --> 01:26:03.640]   You'll have your series of failures, that's that.
[01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:05.520]   That's when you go into the abyss.
[01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:09.000]   You learn, you hopefully learn from those mistakes,
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:12.440]   you have a metamorphosis, you come out, you change,
[01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:14.520]   you hopefully become better,
[01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:17.200]   and you take more responsibilities and so on.
[01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:20.740]   And then when you get to the later part
[01:26:20.740 --> 01:26:24.520]   as you are starting to approach the transition
[01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:28.520]   in that late part of the second phase of your life
[01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:31.160]   before you go into the third phase of your life,
[01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:33.760]   second phase is you're working, trying to be successful.
[01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:37.600]   Third phase of your life is you want people
[01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:40.400]   to be successful without you, okay?
[01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:41.600]   - Yes.
[01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:43.880]   - You want your kids to be successful without you
[01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:46.360]   because when you're at that phase,
[01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:49.480]   they're making their transition from the first phase
[01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:51.960]   to the second phase, and they're trying to be successful,
[01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:54.040]   and you want them to be successful without you,
[01:26:54.040 --> 01:26:56.520]   and you have, your parents are gone,
[01:26:56.520 --> 01:27:00.600]   and then you have freedom, and then you have freedom again.
[01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:03.680]   And with that freedom, and then you have these,
[01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:06.740]   in history shown with this, you have friendships,
[01:27:06.740 --> 01:27:09.640]   you have perspective on life, you have different things,
[01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:12.200]   and that's one of the reasons that that later part
[01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:15.320]   of the life can be real, on average, actually.
[01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:16.160]   It's the highest.
[01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:17.600]   Very interesting thing.
[01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:21.120]   If they, there are surveys, and say,
[01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:24.540]   "How good do you look, and how good do you feel?"
[01:27:24.540 --> 01:27:27.840]   And that's the highest survey.
[01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:30.400]   The person, now they're not looking the best,
[01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:32.160]   and they're not feeling the best, right?
[01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:35.080]   Maybe it's 35 that they're actually looking the best
[01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:38.480]   and feeling the best, but they rank the highest
[01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:41.080]   at that point, survey results of being the highest.
[01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:41.920]   - That's so fascinating.
[01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:44.200]   - In that 70 to 80 period of time,
[01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:47.200]   because it has to do with an attitude on life.
[01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:48.920]   Then you start to have grandkids.
[01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:50.760]   Oh, grandkids are great.
[01:27:50.760 --> 01:27:54.660]   And you start to experience that transition well.
[01:27:54.660 --> 01:27:57.780]   So that's what the arc of life pretty much looks like,
[01:27:57.780 --> 01:28:00.940]   and I'm experiencing it.
[01:28:00.940 --> 01:28:03.940]   - You've learned that when you meditate,
[01:28:03.940 --> 01:28:05.740]   we're all human, we're all mortal.
[01:28:05.740 --> 01:28:09.540]   When you meditate on your own mortality,
[01:28:09.540 --> 01:28:14.540]   having achieved a lot of success on whatever dimension,
[01:28:14.540 --> 01:28:16.980]   what do you think is the meaning of it all?
[01:28:16.980 --> 01:28:20.260]   The meaning of our short existence on Earth
[01:28:20.260 --> 01:28:22.100]   as human beings?
[01:28:22.100 --> 01:28:25.120]   - I think that evolution is the greatest force
[01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:30.120]   of the universe, and that we're all tiny bits
[01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:33.460]   of an evolutionary type of process,
[01:28:33.460 --> 01:28:38.000]   where it's just matter and machines that go through time,
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:43.000]   and that we all have a deeply embedded inclination
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:48.480]   to evolve and contribute to evolution.
[01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:52.000]   So I think it's to personally evolve
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.280]   and contribute to evolution.
[01:28:54.280 --> 01:28:56.200]   - I could have predicted you would answer that way.
[01:28:56.200 --> 01:28:58.280]   It's brilliant and exactly right.
[01:28:58.280 --> 01:29:02.960]   And I think we've said it before, but I'll say it again.
[01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:05.440]   You have a lot of incredible videos out there
[01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:07.540]   that people should definitely watch.
[01:29:07.540 --> 01:29:08.800]   I don't say this often.
[01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:11.560]   I mean, it's literally the best spend of time.
[01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:14.000]   And in terms of reading principles,
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.120]   and reading basically anything you write on LinkedIn
[01:29:16.120 --> 01:29:18.480]   and so on, is a really good use of time.
[01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:20.640]   It's a lot of light bulb moments,
[01:29:20.640 --> 01:29:22.680]   a lot of transformative ideas in there.
[01:29:22.680 --> 01:29:24.760]   So Ray, thank you so much.
[01:29:24.760 --> 01:29:25.640]   It's been an honor.
[01:29:25.640 --> 01:29:26.640]   I really appreciate it.
[01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:28.080]   - It's been a pleasure for me too.
[01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:31.340]   I'm happy to hear it's of use to you and others.
