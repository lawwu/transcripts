[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560]   [intro music]
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.360]   How do I wage war against my self-pity?
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:12.800]   Michael, a listener from Portland, wants help in the battle that he's facing.
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.240]   Pastor John, thank you for this podcast.
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.960]   I struggle with self-pity and often self-justify my self-pity by rationalizing it in my own
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:22.960]   head.
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.520]   Have you experienced this too?
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.800]   If so, what are the best arguments you've made from your own flesh to justify your self-pity
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:36.560]   and what biblical arguments do you use to make war against those selfish arguments?
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.120]   Pastor John, what would you say to Michael?
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.760]   Well, Michael asked, "Have you ever experienced this?"
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:50.160]   So let me put my answer to his question in an autobiographical form.
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:57.920]   Ten years ago this year, I took a leave of absence from the Zen pastoral ministry, and
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.920]   the reason I asked the elders and the church quite openly for this leave was to do what
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.500]   I called a "soul check."
[00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:15.400]   During that leave, I tried to be very specific in identifying my own characteristic besetting
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:24.960]   sins, and it became evident that they were an ugly cluster of selfishness, proneness
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:32.000]   to anger, self-pity, quickness to blame, sullenness.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.520]   That's the cluster.
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:42.040]   And at the root of that was what I called selfishness, and selfishness had five reflexes
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.720]   that I could discern very clearly.
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.920]   I'll tell you in a minute why I call them reflexes.
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.600]   One, the reflex of expecting that I be served, thank you.
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.440]   The reflex of feeling I am owed.
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.460]   The reflex of wanting praise.
[00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.540]   The reflex of expecting that things will go my way.
[00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:11.000]   The reflex of feeling that I have the right to react negatively to being crossed in my
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   desires.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:21.520]   Now, the reason I call those five things reflexes of selfishness is because I don't premeditate
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.520]   any of them.
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.360]   They just happen in my head, in my heart.
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.800]   I didn't decide for any of those to happen.
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.240]   They just are there.
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:42.200]   That's how rooted our unmortified corruption and remaining indwelling sin and selfishness
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.560]   is.
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:54.720]   And I noticed as I kept my sin before my own eyes, I noticed that these selfish reflexes
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:02.280]   gave rise to four characteristic things that were manifest for others to see, not just
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.240]   in my head, but obvious.
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:11.640]   One, anger, the strong emotional opposition to the obstacle that just got in my way.
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:19.740]   Number two, self-pity, a desire that others feel my woundedness and admire me for being
[00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.240]   so mistreated.
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.280]   And that's the one Mike is asking about.
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:32.120]   And third, quickness to blame, a reflex to attribute to others the cause of my frustrating
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.120]   situation.
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:41.840]   And fourth, sullenness, kind of a sinking discouragement, moodiness, hopelessness, unresponsiveness,
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.160]   withdrawn deadness of emotion.
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:53.380]   That's the cluster of John Piper's besetting sins as I identified them 10 years ago.
[00:03:53.380 --> 00:04:01.320]   So what did I learn about the defeat of these monsters in that leave, which has, I think,
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:07.480]   I believe you'd have to ask my wife probably, had gotten me more victory in the last 10
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.600]   years than I had before.
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:18.680]   What the Bible showed me was that there was a disconnect between Christ's cancellation
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:29.360]   of my sins on the cross and my conscious willed opposition and conquering of my own sins through
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.720]   blood-bought, spirit-empowered effort.
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.720]   It was a disconnect.
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:46.480]   In other words, God blasted a pattern of passivity that had developed in me toward those particular
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.440]   cluster of sins.
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:57.120]   He forced into my face the biblical reality that canceled sins, that is, blood-covered
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:08.800]   sins must be killed consciously, with effort, by faith, in the Spirit, not coddled.
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:18.280]   And one of the ways God forced this discovery on me was to expose the inconsistency between
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:25.560]   the very active way that I fought sexual temptation and the fairly passive way that I handled
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.400]   the temptation to self-pity.
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.520]   Now right there's the nub of the matter.
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:40.040]   I had the unspoken assumption that sexual lust must be attacked directly, consciously,
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:45.960]   forcefully, with effort of my mind and my will, since Jesus said, "Tear out your eye,
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:46.960]   Piper.
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.600]   Cut off your hand if you have to," when it comes to the temptation of lust.
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:06:00.520]   But for some crazy, demonic reason, I kind of assumed I could not attack these other
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:06.440]   besetting sins in the same vicious way, and they would somehow just kind of dry up and
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:12.480]   disappear by some inner, unconscious work of the Holy Spirit, without any spirit-empowered,
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:19.320]   conscious, ruthless, vicious, angry, "God, I'm a life devil," effort to cut my hand
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.560]   off or gouge my eye out.
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:30.800]   But it became increasingly clear during this leave of absence that the link between the
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:40.800]   cancellation of my sin on the cross and the conquering of my sin was sanctified effort.
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:52.000]   Now to be sure, the only effort that avails is blood-bought effort, spirit-wrought effort.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.840]   But it is nevertheless a conscious effort of the sanctified will.
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:05.000]   Passivity in the pursuit of holiness is not what the Bible teaches.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.120]   I knew that in relation to sex temptations.
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:12.040]   I was playing like it didn't exist in relationship to self-pity temptations.
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.000]   Oh my goodness.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.440]   So here's the texts of what I mean.
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:17.440]   I mean, there's lots of them.
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:23.960]   I'll just mention two to show the connection between cancellation and conquering.
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:34.220]   In the death of Christ, we died to sin, Paul says, therefore put sin to death, Romans 8:13.
[00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:41.080]   In the death of Christ, we were forgiven, therefore now forgive others just like you've
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.440]   been forgiven.
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:50.200]   Clearly, if you just take those two cases, victory over sin, the death of Christ for
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:08:00.280]   my sin is decisive, but they're followed immediately not by the minimizing of human effort, but
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:03.000]   by the empowering of the will.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.980]   Don't let sin reign in your mortal body.
[00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:07.100]   You have died to it.
[00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:08.860]   Don't let it reign.
[00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:10.500]   Forgive one another.
[00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:20.520]   In other words, God intends that my sanctification include conscious-willed opposition to specific
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:23.020]   sins in my life.
[00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:29.280]   I had applied that to sexual temptation, and I think with significant success over the
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:31.060]   last 40 years or so.
[00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:38.700]   But for some reason, I failed to apply the same brutal intentionality of sin killing
[00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:45.040]   to my selfishness and anger and self-pity and quickness to blame and sullenness.
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:51.060]   So I began to use the same strategy towards self-pity that I was using toward lust.
[00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:53.220]   Let me give you an example.
[00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:57.140]   I came home one Lord's Day evening, and I was tired.
[00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:03.960]   I was hoping to do something with my wife and daughter, who, Talha was still at home.
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:11.660]   And my wife and my daughter were on the couch with the computer watching something together.
[00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:16.700]   And they announced, "We're watching this, and we're going to watch this."
[00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:19.060]   And they didn't say anything about me.
[00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:20.340]   Poor me.
[00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:24.580]   Poor, hardworking pastor me, right?
[00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:26.860]   It just said, "We're enjoying this.
[00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:27.860]   Welcome home.
[00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:30.540]   Do what you want."
[00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:33.140]   My reflexes were immediate.
[00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:36.980]   Frustration, anger, especially self-pity.
[00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:47.620]   So with my new God-given resolve, I did with that temptation what I do with sexual temptation
[00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:48.620]   regularly.
[00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:52.180]   I said, "No, no, self-pity.
[00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:53.180]   No.
[00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:54.180]   Get out of my head.
[00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:56.620]   Go to hell where you belong."
[00:09:56.620 --> 00:10:00.380]   And I went upstairs to my study, and I waged war.
[00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:01.820]   Maybe 10, 15 minutes.
[00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:04.780]   I waged war, effort.
[00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:12.140]   I turned my mind and my heart toward the promises of God and the surety of the cross and the
[00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:17.020]   love of my Father and the wealth of my inheritance in Christ and the blessings of the Lord's
[00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:20.580]   Day that had just gone by and the patience of Jesus.
[00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:25.940]   And I held them there in front of my mind where I could see them, and I cried out to
[00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:29.080]   the Lord for blood-bought help.
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:35.940]   And I consciously, intentionally, consciously, intentionally, not passively, beat down—I
[00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:43.940]   beat it down—the anger and self-pity and blaming and sullenness as utterly out of character
[00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:46.300]   with who I am in Jesus.
[00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:51.820]   And I kept beating until they were effectively dead.
[00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:54.420]   So Mike, there you have it.
[00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:58.220]   You asked, "Do you ever experience this?"
[00:10:58.220 --> 00:10:59.220]   Oh my.
[00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:06.060]   Yes, I have shared your experience, and that's what the Lord taught me 10 years ago.
[00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:14.100]   I think if you were to ask my wife today, "Is Johnny different in that regard from,
[00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:15.780]   say, 20 years ago?"
[00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:21.860]   I think she'd say, "Yes, and I give God great glory."
[00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:26.460]   It's inspiring to hear you still reaching after holiness, Pastor John, and thank you
[00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:31.980]   for joining us today on the podcast for our feed, our archive, or to send us your own
[00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:33.940]   question like Michael did today.
[00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:39.540]   Go online to DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:47.220]   How do we get into the position where God is 100% for me and never again against me?
[00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:49.340]   Is there a more important question for each of us?
[00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:50.580]   I don't think so.
[00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:55.420]   So how do we find a satisfying answer to that question, especially in a world that tells
[00:11:55.420 --> 00:12:01.140]   us that we are good enough or special enough to warrant God's eternal favor?
[00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:06.220]   And in a world full of religions trying to convince us that we can save ourselves, how
[00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:11.660]   can God be 100% for me and never again against me?
[00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:12.660]   That's the question.
[00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:14.060]   Next time, I'm Tony Reinke.
[00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:16.260]   We'll see you back here on Wednesday.
