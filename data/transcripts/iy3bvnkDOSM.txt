[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   (silence)
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:15.000]   - This is a very sad day for me and for the Bogleheads.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.120]   At this point in the conference,
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.920]   I'd normally be introducing Jack Bogle,
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.700]   who would then proceed to impart his words of wisdom
[00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.340]   on those of us in attendance.
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.040]   Today represents the first time in our event's
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.560]   18 year history that we know in advance
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.960]   that Jack won't be joining us.
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.800]   However, I think that Jack is looking down on us
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.140]   and saying, "Keep the conference going.
[00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.580]   "I'm with you in spirit."
[00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.120]   Years ago in Las Vegas, Jack asked me
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.400]   if he could have an informal, non-scripted chat
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.920]   with Bill Bernstein.
[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.580]   And we all know that what Jack wants, he gets.
[00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.400]   So that was the start of what I dubbed
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.500]   the Farside Chat with Jack and Bill.
[00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.920]   And it's continued as part of the conference agenda
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.060]   ever since then.
[00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.680]   Today, we're going to have a very special guest
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.420]   sit in for Jack and continue the Farside Chat.
[00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.400]   Bill McNabb is the former CEO and chairman of Vanguard,
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.240]   leading the firm for a decade until he stepped down
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.360]   as chairman at the end of last year.
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.900]   He assumed the role of CEO in 2008,
[00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.380]   just two weeks before the collapse of Lehman Brothers,
[00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.500]   which marked the beginning of the global financial crisis.
[00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.480]   Bill's consistent focus on doing the right thing for clients
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.520]   helped Vanguard, its crew, and its clients
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.920]   navigate one of the most economically tumultuous periods
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.260]   in the nation's history.
[00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.720]   During his tenure as CEO, Vanguard grew to serve
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.340]   more than 20 million investors around the world.
[00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.780]   And assets quadrupled from $1 trillion in 2008
[00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.260]   to more than 5 trillion at the end of 2018.
[00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.840]   He always attributed this success
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.960]   to putting clients' interests first
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.800]   and working hard to earn and maintain investors' trust.
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.280]   Today, Bill serves as chairman
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.540]   on the board of the Philadelphia Zoo
[00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.600]   and is a member of the board of directors
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.000]   of United Health Group and IBM.
[00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.760]   He's an active alumnus of Dartmouth College
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.680]   and the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.920]   and was awarded an honorary doctorate
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.640]   from St. Joseph University.
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.160]   He continues to be an active member
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.040]   in the investment management industry,
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.720]   championing good governance practices
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.280]   among public companies.
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.540]   Please welcome Bill McDabb.
[00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.700]   (audience applauding)
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:44.880]   - Thank you.
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:52.160]   - And Bill McDabb's companion for this Fireside Chat
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.400]   is a retired neurologist
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.680]   who helped co-found Efficient Frontier Advisors.
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.680]   He's written a number of bestselling titles
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.520]   on both finance and economic history.
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.020]   He holds both a PhD in chemistry and an MD.
[00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.320]   Please welcome one of the brightest guys I know,
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.960]   Dr. Bill Bernstein.
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.120]   (audience applauding)
[00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.500]   - And how about it, guys?
[00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.920]   Everything is fair game except politics.
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.540]   (audience laughing)
[00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:22.380]   - Of course.
[00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.340]   Yeah, well, you know,
[00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.780]   we got three, four hours every year
[00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.980]   of the public Jack Bogle
[00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.300]   and it was quite an education.
[00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.660]   It was quite a personal and emotional experience.
[00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.920]   So we saw a lot of what I suspect was the public Jack,
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.900]   even in front of this group.
[00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.780]   What I'd like you to speak to, Bill,
[00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.780]   is what you saw as the private Jack,
[00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.000]   not only him personally,
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.940]   but what I'm really more interested in
[00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.740]   is what he told you about the capital markets
[00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.020]   and retirement investing
[00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:04.340]   and just investing in general for small investors
[00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.820]   that he might not have said in public.
[00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.020]   - Whoa.
[00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.460]   (audience laughing)
[00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.920]   We might be a couple of days here.
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.280]   First of all, Mel, thank you
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.520]   and thank all of you for being here.
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:18.840]   This is a very emotional time.
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.840]   I think we held a service for Jack in March on the campus
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.480]   and the entire company was tuned in
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:34.480]   and we actually were able to have all of Jack's successors,
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.640]   Jack Brennan, Tim Buckley, myself,
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.900]   as well as Jack's son, John, speak to the entire company.
[00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:42.740]   So you think about it,
[00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.660]   four generations of leadership represented.
[00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.380]   I can't think of another company in America
[00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.140]   where that could happen.
[00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.700]   And again, you've got to give Jack Bogle so much credit
[00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.940]   for sort of creating that legacy.
[00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.620]   So again, I know he is looking down.
[00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.220]   He would greatly appreciate seeing all of you here.
[00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.420]   Bill, I thought what I might do
[00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.540]   is I might start with just a couple of quick Bogle stories
[00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.880]   because I think they actually will give you a sense
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.060]   of the man, what it was like to work for him.
[00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.480]   And I tell this because the day we heard
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.740]   about Jack's passing, I happened to be on campus
[00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.980]   and I was walking, just walking around,
[00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.620]   just crisscrossing building to building.
[00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.980]   And I had so many different crew members come up
[00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.180]   and say something.
[00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.060]   And people I knew, I've worked at Vanguard for 33 years,
[00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.220]   so I know a lot of our crew,
[00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.140]   but there were also some folks I don't know and new people.
[00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.700]   And the most common question was,
[00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.860]   what are your favorite memories?
[00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.140]   What are your favorite memories?
[00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:46.820]   And there's a lot, but there were three
[00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.300]   that I sort of told on a repeated basis.
[00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.140]   So I thought I'd start with that
[00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:53.780]   and then we can delve into some of the more deeper questions
[00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:55.060]   about the markets and so forth.
[00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:59.060]   So I had the privilege of,
[00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.780]   I came to Philadelphia right after college
[00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.980]   to teach, I was teaching at a boys' school
[00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:07.300]   and coaching through sports.
[00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.420]   Sort of stumbled my way to Penn
[00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:13.060]   and sort of worked my way through Wharton.
[00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:14.580]   Went up to New York for a couple of years
[00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:19.160]   and was, frankly, pretty dissatisfied where I was working.
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.280]   I love the work, actually.
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.560]   I was an analyst working for what's now JPMorgan Chase,
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:25.460]   but I didn't like the culture.
[00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.220]   I didn't like a lot of the,
[00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:28.580]   I call it strategic direction.
[00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.380]   So I began to get itchy.
[00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:31.500]   My wife is from Philly.
[00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.100]   I love my time here.
[00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.140]   So we began thinking about coming back.
[00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.420]   Her family's all from here.
[00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.380]   And I got a call from a friend of mine
[00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:43.780]   from business school who had gone into executive search.
[00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:46.900]   He goes, "I've got sort of good news and bad news."
[00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:49.740]   And I said, "Well, give me the good news."
[00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:50.900]   And he said, "I've just been hired
[00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:54.040]   "by this little company you've probably never heard of,
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:57.200]   "Vanguard, to do a search and I think you'd be perfect."
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.020]   I'm like, "Well, what could the bad news be?"
[00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:02.540]   And he says, "It's not exactly the kind of role
[00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:04.620]   "you would envision yourself doing."
[00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:06.140]   And I said, "What do you mean?"
[00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:09.060]   He says, "Well, you know, you're doing leverage buyouts
[00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:12.060]   "and M&A transactions, all this fancy stuff
[00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:12.900]   "on Wall Street."
[00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:17.240]   He goes, "They're looking for a GIC product manager."
[00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.420]   (audience laughing)
[00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:19.260]   Now I'm gonna ask this audience.
[00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:20.620]   This audience is pretty,
[00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:23.060]   how many of you know what a GIC is?
[00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:26.340]   Yeah, all right, so almost a third.
[00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:27.860]   Guaranteed investment contract.
[00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:31.300]   It was kind of like a certificate of deposit, if you will,
[00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.340]   issued by an insurance company to a qualified plan.
[00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:37.500]   So it was the most popular option along with company stock
[00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.500]   in the early 401(k) days.
[00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.540]   And we were just getting into 401(k) business
[00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:45.200]   and we had just begun work there.
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:50.200]   And so Jack and others within Vanguard decided
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.340]   we needed to sort of beef up our efforts there
[00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:54.180]   if we were gonna be successful.
[00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:55.700]   I didn't know what it was.
[00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:56.960]   You know, it's before the internet.
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:59.660]   So I'm running around, going to libraries, looking it up.
[00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:01.340]   (audience laughing)
[00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:04.300]   Trying to find out stories.
[00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.860]   Anyway, I had to come down.
[00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:10.000]   And one thing that has not changed at Vanguard
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.860]   is we're very rigorous in our interview process.
[00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:16.020]   So I think I came three different times.
[00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:18.260]   Probably went through 20 some odd interviews.
[00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.220]   And remember, we were a few hundred people.
[00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:24.140]   And at that point, about 20 billion under management.
[00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:25.860]   And finally, the last interview,
[00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:28.340]   they're like, "We want you to meet the founder."
[00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:31.740]   And again, this is a pretty junior level role
[00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:32.740]   within the company.
[00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:36.160]   So I was surprised.
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.860]   But if you made more than, I think, 15 or $20,000
[00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:40.380]   in those days, Jack had to interview you
[00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:41.780]   and had to sign off.
[00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:45.260]   You know, the attention to detail was pretty great.
[00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:49.020]   So anyway, I come in to do the interview
[00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:53.500]   and Jack kind of picks up my resume and he looks at it
[00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:55.900]   and he goes, "You know, I bet you're an ambitious
[00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:57.160]   "young fella."
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.340]   (audience laughing)
[00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:03.660]   "I don't know why you'd come here."
[00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:04.700]   And that was literally.
[00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:08.000]   And I'm, "Well, Mr. Bubble, you asked me to interview you."
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.700]   And then for the next hour and a half,
[00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:12.860]   Jack proceeded to tell me why I should be there.
[00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:14.300]   And you know, he held court.
[00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:15.540]   He was lying on his couch.
[00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:18.140]   He had just come back from a heart incident,
[00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:19.100]   as he called it.
[00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:21.340]   And the doctors were making him put his feet up.
[00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:24.620]   And so we went through this about an hour and a half.
[00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:26.860]   I think I got two words in edgewise.
[00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:31.620]   So I go home and my wife says, "Well, how'd it go?"
[00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:32.700]   'Cause she was really, by this time,
[00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:33.920]   she was ready to come back to Philly.
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.500]   And I said, "I have no idea.
[00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:37.500]   "I didn't say anything."
[00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.500]   (audience laughing)
[00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:40.980]   And she goes, "Well, what are you gonna do?"
[00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:43.060]   I said, "Well, if I'm offered the job, I'm going."
[00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:44.540]   I said it was compelling.
[00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:46.220]   'Cause you could feel the passion.
[00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:47.380]   You could feel the energy.
[00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:52.060]   You could feel there was something different.
[00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:53.380]   You know, there was something obviously different
[00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:54.220]   about Jack.
[00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:55.040]   You all know that.
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:55.880]   But there was something different
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:56.900]   about the mission of the company.
[00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:58.720]   And it really appealed to me.
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.580]   So I accepted.
[00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:01.420]   I was fortunate.
[00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:02.460]   I got the job.
[00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:03.940]   I really wasn't qualified for it.
[00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:07.780]   But I'm forever grateful that somebody took a bet.
[00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:11.140]   And then I was here only about a week.
[00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:15.300]   And I got a call from Jack saying, "Hey, let's have lunch."
[00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:16.660]   And so we go and we have lunch.
[00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:18.580]   This is really the second part of the story.
[00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:22.060]   And we go to our galley.
[00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:23.860]   As you know, everything's nautical.
[00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:25.420]   Even in those early days.
[00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:27.380]   We had two buildings back then.
[00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:29.260]   And we're going through the line.
[00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:34.260]   And Jack is negotiating with the chef
[00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.860]   over an order of French fries.
[00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:39.400]   And the chef is saying, "Mr. Bobo,
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:40.240]   "you can't have French fries.
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:41.340]   "They're not good for your heart."
[00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:43.520]   And he's like, "Well, how about a half an order?"
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:44.620]   And they're going back and forth.
[00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:48.220]   And again, I had just left J.P. Morgan Chase.
[00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:52.020]   You know, I'd been privileged, quote unquote,
[00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:55.140]   to have lunch with the vice chair of the bank
[00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:57.100]   who would push a button under the table
[00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:59.700]   and like six waiters would come running in.
[00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:02.140]   So I'm watching this going,
[00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:03.940]   like I think my eyes are popping out of my head.
[00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:06.480]   And he turns to me and he goes, "What are you staring at?"
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.260]   (audience laughing)
[00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.820]   I said, "I've never seen anything like this."
[00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:12.260]   And he says, "Well," he goes,
[00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.580]   "let me make a point really clear."
[00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:18.500]   He goes, "Everybody's job here matters.
[00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:22.340]   "And it doesn't matter whether you're a chef
[00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:25.680]   "in the cafeteria or you're an executive
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.700]   "or you're a portfolio manager.
[00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:29.520]   "Everybody matters."
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:30.360]   And he goes, "The only thing
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.260]   "that's gonna really get me upset
[00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.240]   "is if I see a big shot kicking a little shot,
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.500]   "I'm gonna kick the big shot out of the company."
[00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:39.200]   And it was one of those object lessons, right?
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.860]   You know, I was 29 years old,
[00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:43.460]   trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my life.
[00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:46.660]   And you get this sort of wisdom imparted to you.
[00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:49.700]   And I never forgot that conversation.
[00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:53.180]   And then the third story, and then we will get serious.
[00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:55.500]   But again, I just wanna give you the flavor
[00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:56.980]   for what it was like to work with Jack.
[00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:01.060]   So many of you know, he was a very avid squash player.
[00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:03.220]   And despite all the heart issues,
[00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:04.780]   he would find a doctor who would sign off
[00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:05.620]   and let him play squash.
[00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:07.420]   You know, he would just sort of rotate from,
[00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:08.780]   I'm looking at his daughters and they're like,
[00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:10.220]   "Yeah, yeah, they knew the story."
[00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:15.220]   So 1994, late '94, I was privileged
[00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:21.860]   to be asked to join the executive team.
[00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:23.140]   Jack was still CEO.
[00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:26.660]   And so I was gonna join what we call senior staff
[00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:29.540]   and run the 401k business
[00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:31.860]   and the other institutional businesses.
[00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:34.860]   And Jack's health had begun to turn,
[00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:36.300]   but he was still feisty as ever.
[00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:39.140]   And he's like, "Let's go play squash."
[00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:42.020]   Now, I'm not much of a squash player, just to be very clear.
[00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:46.820]   But you know, I had 30 years on Jack and I was an ex-rower.
[00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:49.340]   So I had a fair amount of fitness
[00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:51.100]   so I could run around the court.
[00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:55.140]   So we go and he goes, "Hey," he goes, "I hate to do this,
[00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:57.100]   "but I don't think he hated to do it at all."
[00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:00.060]   He goes, "He taught me to work the defibrillator."
[00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:02.620]   (audience laughing)
[00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:05.740]   So you wanna talk about intimidation, right?
[00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:07.700]   (audience laughing)
[00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:10.900]   You got the founder and the lifeblood of the company
[00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:12.540]   and he's teaching you how to work the defibrillator.
[00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:14.620]   He goes, "I don't think we'll need it, but just in case."
[00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:16.300]   (audience laughing)
[00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:18.420]   So forget my strategy of just running around.
[00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:19.980]   I'm like one shot and I'm done.
[00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:22.220]   Like go for the winner all the time.
[00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:26.340]   So we played in the first two games, Jack won.
[00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:28.980]   Next two games, I won.
[00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:31.700]   And then he sort of slumped, "Oh my God, here it comes."
[00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:34.660]   And he said, "You know, I don't think I," he goes,
[00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:35.940]   "You know me, I never quit."
[00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:37.540]   But he goes, "I just don't think I can finish."
[00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:38.900]   I'm like, "Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:39.740]   "We're gonna get out of here.
[00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:40.620]   "He's gonna be alive.
[00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:42.500]   "I don't have to work the defibrillator."
[00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:47.500]   So we left and then Jack's health deteriorated further
[00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:50.540]   and he was in and out of the company a lot.
[00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:52.460]   And he ended up going to the hospital
[00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:54.780]   and waiting for the transplant.
[00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:58.860]   So about nine months after the transplant, I get a call
[00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:00.620]   and it's not, "Hey Bill, how you doing?"
[00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:03.740]   It's not, it's, "We have unfinished business."
[00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:06.220]   (audience laughing)
[00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:09.380]   And it's Jack and his son, John,
[00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:12.340]   had given him a new squash racket.
[00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:15.100]   And so we had to go play squash.
[00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:17.260]   I had not looked at a squash racket since then.
[00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:18.860]   Jack had been playing nonstop.
[00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:21.860]   But it was, and trust me, this was one of those,
[00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:22.980]   you've heard of boss's golf.
[00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:24.060]   There was boss's squash.
[00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:26.140]   There was no way I was gonna win this match.
[00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:30.140]   So, but we, but you know, it was just classic Jack.
[00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:34.860]   And, you know, you mentioned that he would always,
[00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:37.620]   you know, encourage people to keep going.
[00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:39.540]   You know, his phrase was, "Press on regardless,"
[00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:43.980]   as you know, and it was a great, great lesson
[00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:45.380]   about press on regardless.
[00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:46.700]   And, you know, again, these are things
[00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:48.340]   that are imprinted on you.
[00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:50.500]   And, you know, as you're joining the executive team
[00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:54.100]   to see that kind of fire and that kind of passion
[00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:55.260]   was really important.
[00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:59.140]   So those are, you know, a couple of fun stories,
[00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:00.260]   if you will, to give you a sense
[00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:01.660]   of what it was like to work for him.
[00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:03.780]   You know, in terms of the business stuff,
[00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:09.460]   I think the most important lesson he imparted,
[00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:14.340]   and it's interesting, I'm not sure he would say this,
[00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:18.380]   so I say it with, you know, all respect.
[00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:21.220]   He had this phrase that he loved to use
[00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:25.060]   in a lot of his speeches around creative destruction.
[00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:29.100]   And Joseph Schumpeter, the great Austrian economist,
[00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:33.140]   had really, you know, written extensively about this,
[00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:34.700]   and Jack just loved it.
[00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:36.060]   And I think Jack looked at himself
[00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:38.780]   as the creative destroyer, and, you know,
[00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:41.100]   somebody who would upend the markets,
[00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:43.620]   upend the way business was done.
[00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:48.620]   And so he took Schumpeter's words very, very much to heart.
[00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:54.420]   And we talked a lot about that in my early days as CEO,
[00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:57.260]   and, you know, what was interesting
[00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:02.260]   is it gave you confidence as a leader.
[00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.460]   It also provoked you to think about
[00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:10.460]   how do you actually disrupt yourself?
[00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:12.180]   And if you think about Vanguard,
[00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:14.780]   and many of you have lived through multiple generations
[00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:17.660]   of the organization, we have changed quite a bit
[00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:22.820]   with the times, you know, from a little startup
[00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:25.900]   where, you know, the virtual relationship
[00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:27.580]   was through the post office box,
[00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:29.540]   and a huge technological revolution
[00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:31.700]   was the 800 phone number,
[00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:34.500]   to, you know, the creation of Vanguard.com,
[00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:36.500]   to now all the virtual advice,
[00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:39.620]   and, you know, things you can do in that space.
[00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:43.620]   And, you know, it was Jack's philosophy
[00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:45.740]   about creative destruction,
[00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:49.300]   which was way ahead of all the other writers
[00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:51.540]   who talked about disruption.
[00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:53.700]   And, you know, whether it was Andy Grove,
[00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:55.580]   "Only the Paranoid Survive,"
[00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:57.580]   or, you know, some of the other,
[00:16:57.580 --> 00:16:59.540]   Clay Christensen, who, you know,
[00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:00.860]   has written extensively about this,
[00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:02.580]   Jack was really ahead of them,
[00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:06.220]   and actually viewed his life's work, if you will,
[00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:08.180]   as being a disruptor.
[00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:12.340]   That wisdom, more than all the market stuff,
[00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:16.100]   believe it or not, was actually the most valuable lesson
[00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:18.300]   that he imparted, at least for me,
[00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:21.620]   because what it challenged us to do as a leadership team
[00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:25.500]   is to think about how would you beat Vanguard?
[00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:29.100]   How would you do a better job serving our clients
[00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:30.340]   than we can do?
[00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:31.820]   And then, what do you have to do
[00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:34.060]   to respond to that as an organization?
[00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:35.500]   And we certainly don't always get it right,
[00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:37.060]   but that's what we've tried to do.
[00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:40.140]   That's been, you know, that's been at the heart of,
[00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:42.340]   the heart and soul of who we are.
[00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:44.060]   And if you think about it, you know,
[00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:47.740]   Jack's initial revolutions, if you will,
[00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:51.860]   were all around our structure, and then around low cost,
[00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:54.660]   and then indexing being the, you know,
[00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:57.300]   purest expression of the low cost.
[00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:00.220]   But so many of the other things that we've done since
[00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:04.980]   are really built upon the foundation of creative destruction
[00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:07.100]   and finding ways to disrupt yourselves
[00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:08.620]   before somebody else does it to you.
[00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:10.820]   So, again, when I think back,
[00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:13.580]   when I think back to all the different lessons
[00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:15.020]   Jack imparted, that probably
[00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:17.260]   was the single most important, Bill.
[00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:18.700]   Now, there are lots of things we could talk about
[00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:22.020]   in terms of capital markets and structure and whatnot,
[00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:25.620]   and I'm happy to go there, but it was that notion,
[00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:27.820]   at least for me, and, you know, again,
[00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:29.460]   some of it may have been timing,
[00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:31.900]   coming into my role in the middle, you know,
[00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:33.660]   at the beginning of the crisis,
[00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:35.620]   that actually was very liberating.
[00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:38.660]   And Jack and I did have a lot of conversations
[00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:43.220]   in those early days, and it was very, very good advice,
[00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:47.420]   you know, sort of, I'll call it a lesson imparted.
[00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:52.820]   - Well, that brings up a second question then,
[00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:54.780]   which is, you know, we all know about
[00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:59.020]   his 1951 senior thesis at Princeton,
[00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:00.580]   which, you know, the heart of which
[00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:03.980]   was the disruption of the industry.
[00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:07.220]   So, obviously, you know, the desire to do that
[00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:11.260]   and that drive arose, you know,
[00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:12.660]   when he was a very young man.
[00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:16.340]   And do you have any sense of where that came from?
[00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:19.460]   - Yeah, I think so.
[00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:24.460]   So, you know, his, I think it's, you know,
[00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:27.620]   most of you have heard Jack's family story,
[00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:30.060]   and, you know, he ended up,
[00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:34.860]   his family had been very successful and fairly well-to-do,
[00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:37.420]   and then, during the Great Depression,
[00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:40.900]   lost everything, essentially, and had to start over.
[00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:43.220]   And Jack actually was a scholarship student
[00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:44.260]   at Blair Academy.
[00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:46.780]   Again, I had the privilege of being at Blair
[00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:50.620]   a couple months ago, doing a memorial for Jack,
[00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:55.620]   and it was extraordinary to see his impact on Blair Academy.
[00:19:55.620 --> 00:20:00.860]   I actually think some of it started there, Bill.
[00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:02.700]   You know, he had the weight tables,
[00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:06.340]   he was, you know, he was very aware he was on scholarship,
[00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:07.860]   and, you know, there were a lot of other
[00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:10.180]   very well-to-do students there.
[00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:14.660]   And I think that created a restlessness in him
[00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:19.340]   that made him question things a little bit more deeply
[00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:24.020]   than others might have done at the same age,
[00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:27.020]   or with the same sets of experiences.
[00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:30.660]   And it was that restlessness and questioning
[00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:32.540]   about how things could be better,
[00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:35.740]   I think that was fundamental to who he was.
[00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:40.740]   You know, interestingly, when he came out of Princeton,
[00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:46.300]   the two choices he had were to go work
[00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:47.860]   for Philadelphia National Bank,
[00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:51.180]   which was kind of the thing you should have done,
[00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:53.420]   or go work for this little mutual fund company
[00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:56.780]   that he, you know, he'd written about the industry.
[00:20:56.780 --> 00:21:00.020]   And I think he actually wrestled with that decision,
[00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:02.660]   but then, you know, decided to go with Walter Morgan,
[00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:04.180]   as you all know.
[00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:09.100]   And again, I think the, you know,
[00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:13.300]   what was exposed in the 1951 thesis
[00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:16.500]   got reinforced by being with Mr. Morgan.
[00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:19.700]   Again, I had the privilege of interacting
[00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:21.980]   with Walter Morgan for a number of years
[00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:23.900]   before he passed away.
[00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:25.780]   And 'cause he would come to board meetings,
[00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:27.980]   and he would come to events, and so forth.
[00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:29.300]   And he took great pride, obviously,
[00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:30.980]   in what Jack had accomplished.
[00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:34.420]   Again, he was kind of a revolutionary in his day,
[00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:38.420]   in that the Wellington Fund was a balanced fund,
[00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:41.820]   focused on high-quality companies, and high dividends,
[00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:44.340]   and, you know, really high-quality bonds,
[00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:47.020]   during a period where it was leverage,
[00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:49.860]   and really aggressive growth, if you will,
[00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:51.420]   were the mantras of the day.
[00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:53.460]   So I think he found a kindred spirit,
[00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:55.940]   which sort of reinforced some of those notions.
[00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:59.420]   But I think a lot of it came from the way, you know,
[00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:01.460]   came from Blair, and came from the restlessness
[00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:02.540]   that was created there.
[00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:06.620]   And, you know, this, I don't know how you teach this,
[00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:07.460]   because I'm not sure it can be,
[00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:10.020]   I think it's just something that is sparked in an individual,
[00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:15.020]   but his creativity was one of his great strengths.
[00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:18.580]   And, you know, when you would be in meetings with him,
[00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:22.460]   the questions that would come from Jack
[00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:24.700]   were different than the questions that would come
[00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:27.740]   from 98 out of 100 other people.
[00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:31.460]   And, you know, I don't know exactly where that comes from,
[00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:32.860]   except, you know, the background certainly
[00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:34.420]   had something to do with it, and the restlessness.
[00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:36.500]   But he was never satisfied
[00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:38.220]   with just sort of conventional thinking.
[00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:41.460]   And I think that lack of satisfaction,
[00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:44.620]   and that embracing of, I'll call it disruptive ways
[00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:48.020]   of doing things, started at a young age,
[00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:52.580]   and became just part of his mantras as time went on.
[00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:55.940]   - Yeah, Mel Turner last night reminded me
[00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:58.900]   of one of my favorite passages from Fred Schwed's
[00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:01.460]   "Where Are the Customers' Yachts?"
[00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:04.580]   which was, you know, when brokers were explaining
[00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:07.220]   to the younger brokers how the business worked,
[00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:09.180]   they explained that they would throw all the money
[00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:10.900]   at the ceiling, and what stuck to the ceiling
[00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:12.060]   was the clients.
[00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:18.020]   And so it was obvious that that was the world back then,
[00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:20.180]   that Jack wanted to disrupt.
[00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:24.700]   What made Jack unhappy about the capital markets
[00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:26.060]   in the last decade or two?
[00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:30.380]   What did he see now that he wanted to disrupt?
[00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:35.380]   - Yeah, so, and this is where Jack and I sometimes had,
[00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:39.620]   I will say, spirited discussions.
[00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:41.460]   (audience laughing)
[00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:44.860]   You know, Jack worried about ETFs initially.
[00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:47.740]   He thought that they were a trading vehicle.
[00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:49.980]   I think as many of you have read,
[00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:51.660]   and Jack didn't speak about it a lot,
[00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:54.180]   but he did talk about it, especially later in life,
[00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:55.900]   you know, we'd actually had the opportunity
[00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:59.700]   to launch the first ETF, you know, what became the Spider,
[00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:02.020]   you know, State Street did,
[00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:05.420]   and then the, you know, the Quadruple Q,
[00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:08.860]   or whatever it is, you know, on NASDAQ.
[00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:11.140]   He passed on that because he felt
[00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:12.540]   they were just trading vehicles.
[00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:15.740]   And in the early days, that's actually what they were.
[00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:19.540]   They were essentially a derivative substitute.
[00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:23.220]   And so he really was not very aligned
[00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:26.180]   with the whole creation of that.
[00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:29.260]   And, you know, he continued to worry about it
[00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:33.540]   even as, you know, we got more into that business.
[00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:36.060]   And, you know, I think the point, you know,
[00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:37.940]   I tried to make to him, I know Gus Sautter,
[00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:39.740]   our CIO at the time who, you know,
[00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:43.700]   invented our class structure for ETFs.
[00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:46.140]   You know, we made the point that you don't have
[00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:47.940]   to use these as a trading vehicle.
[00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:50.820]   You know, the beauty is they can actually serve
[00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:53.260]   that purpose, but they can also be a buy and hold strategy
[00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:55.620]   and be incredibly effective as well,
[00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:59.340]   especially for an advisor putting a portfolio together
[00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:01.420]   in a very low cost way for someone.
[00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:05.060]   And you may have seen Jack soften on that
[00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:07.740]   a little bit over time, and he would talk about that.
[00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:08.900]   He would talk about the difference.
[00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:11.900]   But, you know, Bill, I do think he really worried
[00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:14.180]   about the product proliferation there.
[00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:16.540]   He worried about some of the, you know,
[00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:19.460]   crazy structures that were coming out.
[00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:22.060]   He worried about leverage in ETFs,
[00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:24.500]   implicit leverage in particular.
[00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:27.220]   So I think that was a fairly big concern.
[00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:29.660]   But, you know, for me, what was interesting was
[00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:32.180]   it was actually the same set of concerns
[00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:35.180]   that Jack had always had about the mutual fund industry.
[00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:37.780]   It was a very parallel set of concerns,
[00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:39.820]   because again, I sat through all the meetings
[00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:41.980]   during the late '80s and early '90s with him
[00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:45.380]   on product development stuff, where he worried
[00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:48.220]   that there was a new fund coming out every hour,
[00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:49.740]   you know, different flavor or something.
[00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:52.420]   And he just thought it was all being done
[00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:55.180]   just for salesmanship as opposed
[00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:58.260]   for really good investment principles.
[00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:01.860]   And, you know, one of the things he charged us with
[00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:05.380]   as a result was any time we brought a new fund out,
[00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:08.780]   we really had to be asking the fundamental question about,
[00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:13.780]   is this a needed and useful solution for people?
[00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:18.100]   And, you know, it was a really good test for us.
[00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:21.980]   But I think he continued right up to his last days
[00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:23.620]   to worry about the product proliferation,
[00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:25.300]   in particular on the ETF side.
[00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:28.620]   You know, I think on the capital market side,
[00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:30.900]   the other concern he had, and one which I share
[00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:34.900]   pretty deeply, was the rise of algorithmic trading
[00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:39.340]   and what's happening in that world.
[00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:42.980]   And he spoke about that several times.
[00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:45.660]   You know, it's a really, really complex topic,
[00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:49.620]   as some of you know, because, in a sense,
[00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:52.420]   without some of this trading now,
[00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:53.700]   I'm not sure markets would actually work
[00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:54.740]   as well as they work.
[00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:58.260]   And that has more to do with the structure
[00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:01.060]   of the U.S. markets than anything else.
[00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:04.300]   But a lot of the knitting, if you will,
[00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:08.620]   that's there is, you know, these algorithmic traders
[00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:11.740]   actually provide an incredible amount of liquidity.
[00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:14.260]   You know, the problem is they don't necessarily
[00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:16.820]   provide the liquidity when you most need it,
[00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:18.220]   because they're not regulated in that way.
[00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:20.900]   And I think there's, you know, Jack was always
[00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:22.940]   sort of pushing the SEC to think about that,
[00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:25.340]   and I think the SEC actually is looking at that.
[00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:28.420]   Many of the rule changes that have occurred
[00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:31.220]   to sort of reign some of that in,
[00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:35.060]   they may have had their origins in some of Jack's speeches,
[00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:37.260]   and then certainly some of our policy advocacy
[00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:39.300]   to tighten things up there.
[00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:40.980]   And I would say we're in a better place
[00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:42.420]   than we were as a result.
[00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:48.180]   - Yeah, a couple of thoughts about that.
[00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:50.340]   You know, whenever I hear a hedge fund manager
[00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:53.940]   talk about benefits of hedge funds to society,
[00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:56.460]   that they in particular provide liquidity,
[00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:58.740]   whenever I hear the words we provide liquidity,
[00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:00.540]   I hold onto my wallet.
[00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:03.780]   (audience laughing)
[00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:06.500]   Vanguard, like all large corporations,
[00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:11.500]   you know, faces challenges from within and without.
[00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:15.860]   And I'd like you to address each of those,
[00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:20.180]   and I'll direct you to start with the easy one,
[00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:23.060]   which is what do you see as the external challenges
[00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:25.660]   to Vanguard, then we'll get to the internal ones.
[00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:27.940]   - Yeah, so, you know, on the external side,
[00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:30.500]   there's no shortage of challenges right now.
[00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:32.540]   I mean, there are many competitors
[00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:35.660]   who are actually trying to come at us on the price side,
[00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:38.940]   being very selective about how they do that.
[00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:41.260]   And, you know, the interesting thing is
[00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:46.260]   the market's actually been pretty discerning about that.
[00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:49.180]   So when, you know, some people come out with,
[00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:52.260]   you know, really low-cost funds or ETFs,
[00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:54.980]   they look at the other prices of the other product suite
[00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:57.220]   that gets sort of blended together.
[00:28:57.220 --> 00:28:59.900]   And, you know, again, a lot of analysts
[00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:03.340]   have actually called our competitors on that,
[00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:04.740]   and it actually hasn't reversed that much.
[00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:09.740]   But the fact is, low-cost is no longer our domain alone.
[00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:11.940]   And I actually think this is a good thing.
[00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:15.820]   And, you know, the competitor in me hates it,
[00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:19.100]   but the societal person in me loves it
[00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:21.020]   because investors are better off.
[00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:23.420]   And at the end of the day, you know,
[00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:27.700]   Jack's dream of changing the industry
[00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:29.020]   is actually happening.
[00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:31.060]   People are actually paying attention to cost.
[00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:32.820]   So from a competitive standpoint,
[00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:34.660]   that's certainly an issue for us.
[00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:38.540]   But the second one is we're big,
[00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:42.780]   and we're increasingly the largest shareholder
[00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:44.740]   in most companies.
[00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:47.740]   And so that puts you under the microscope,
[00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:49.900]   both from a regulatory and government standpoint,
[00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:54.900]   as well as from a just outside pundit standpoint.
[00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:58.060]   And we certainly hear a lot about those issues.
[00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:00.540]   You know, there have been a couple of papers
[00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:04.580]   written about, you know, Vanguard's too big.
[00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:05.780]   It needs to be broken up
[00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:09.300]   because it's gonna exert too much control
[00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:10.900]   on corporate America and so forth.
[00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:14.740]   And, you know, there's even a conspiracy theory out there
[00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:18.020]   that somehow Larry Fink and I were working together
[00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:20.660]   to raise airline prices
[00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:22.540]   because we both are the most significant owners
[00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:24.180]   in airlines, and that would be, you know,
[00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:25.340]   a really good thing for us.
[00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:29.540]   Which, this is a great example of somebody
[00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:31.660]   mixing correlation and causation
[00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:34.900]   and not really understanding the difference between the two.
[00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:37.820]   But I say it, you know, partly tongue-in-cheek,
[00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:38.980]   but seriously as well.
[00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:40.940]   I mean, we actually have to spend time on this stuff.
[00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:43.700]   You know, we have to spend a lot of time educating people.
[00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:48.100]   So I look at the, from the external standpoint,
[00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:52.540]   just the scrutiny that goes on
[00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:55.300]   because of the success of the firm.
[00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:59.380]   And it's a privilege to have that scrutiny, in a sense.
[00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:01.540]   But it's also, you know, it takes a lot of time
[00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:02.500]   for our leadership team,
[00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:06.020]   and time that you'd rather, frankly, devote to the clients
[00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:08.740]   and just being focused on the business.
[00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:12.500]   You know, internally, I think the biggest risk we have
[00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:14.340]   is our success.
[00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:16.500]   And it is becoming complacent.
[00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:21.060]   And I know Tim Buckley shares this with me.
[00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:24.260]   Again, you do not grow up in the house of Ogle
[00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:29.260]   with a notion that complacency is a good thing.
[00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:29.980]   I just say that.
[00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:33.020]   You know, it was so imparted,
[00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:34.700]   so frequently imparted to us
[00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:39.380]   that the minute complacency seeps in, you're dead.
[00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:43.900]   And one of the really interesting things,
[00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:49.100]   probably two months into Tim taking over as CEO,
[00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:51.740]   he put a book on all of his leader's table,
[00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:54.940]   leader's desk, called "The Founder's Mentality."
[00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:58.660]   And it was sort of getting back to the urgency
[00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:00.780]   of a brand-new company
[00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:07.500]   and having to, you know, earn your way each and every day.
[00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:11.940]   You know, again, no disrespect to the past,
[00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:17.100]   but just saying, have we maintained our sense of urgency?
[00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:18.980]   So I had a couple people come running into my office
[00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:21.180]   and go, you know, their hair's on fire.
[00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:22.500]   "Can you believe Tim's doing this?"
[00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:24.740]   I'm like, "Yeah, I think the board actually made
[00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:27.100]   "a great choice in the next generation
[00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:30.060]   "because that's exactly what he should be doing."
[00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:33.780]   And so, Bill, that's the thing that I think worries us.
[00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:37.460]   I think we've got the right leadership team to combat it,
[00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:40.820]   but it's a never-ending battle.
[00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:44.540]   The more successful you are,
[00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:48.340]   in some ways, the less willing you are to take risks
[00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:51.420]   and in creating new ways of doing things
[00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:53.300]   and thinking outside the box,
[00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:55.780]   which has, again, been our hallmark.
[00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:58.140]   I grew up in Rochester, New York,
[00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:01.060]   so I watched this up close and personal.
[00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:04.180]   Eastman Kodak, many of you probably know the story.
[00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:09.860]   Eastman Kodak actually invented digital photography.
[00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:12.260]   But Eastman Kodak did not, you know,
[00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:15.500]   this got to sort of the definition of what Eastman Kodak.
[00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:19.060]   Eastman Kodak considered itself a film company
[00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:22.820]   and that if you read their mission statement and so forth,
[00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:24.740]   that's what it was all about.
[00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:27.140]   And they missed this unbelievable revolution
[00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:28.460]   that was going on.
[00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:31.540]   If Eastman Kodak had considered itself
[00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:33.540]   its main mission in life,
[00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:37.660]   to be the preserver of memories,
[00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:40.780]   they would have approached it completely differently.
[00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:43.780]   So one of the things that we did, you know,
[00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:46.100]   as we were getting bigger and more successful,
[00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:49.660]   we actually restated our mission.
[00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:50.780]   And, you know, we went back.
[00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:54.100]   I actually, I reread everyone in Jack's speeches,
[00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:56.340]   looked at a lot of Jack Brennan's writings on this
[00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:57.180]   and so forth.
[00:33:57.180 --> 00:33:59.780]   And the team came up with, you know,
[00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:01.980]   our current purpose, if you will,
[00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:03.660]   which is to take a stand for all investors,
[00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:04.940]   treat them fairly,
[00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:08.060]   give them the best chance for investment success.
[00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:09.500]   And you might notice in there,
[00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:12.060]   there's nothing about being the low-cost provider
[00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:14.860]   of mutual funds or, you know,
[00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:18.460]   anything that's really limiting.
[00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:20.460]   That, and again, we're not going away
[00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:22.340]   from low-cost mutual funds, trust me.
[00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:26.300]   But the idea that our job is to give investors
[00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:30.940]   the best chance for success and to take a stand for them,
[00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:33.740]   it was so deeply embedded in the founding of this company,
[00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:36.660]   we felt it very important to make the statement.
[00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:38.380]   And, you know, Bill, for me,
[00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:40.860]   that's how you try to combat, you know,
[00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:42.060]   the thing I worry about.
[00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:45.180]   But look, I'd be, I would be less than honest
[00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:47.700]   if I didn't tell you I go to bed every night worried
[00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:49.980]   that success goes to our head.
[00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:53.860]   And again, I have great faith in the leadership team
[00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:54.740]   that's in place,
[00:34:54.740 --> 00:34:58.100]   but that will be a never-ending battle for us.
[00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:01.060]   - Yeah, there's something that I think about a lot,
[00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:04.060]   which is not just the differentiation
[00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:06.300]   between what the public sector does,
[00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:10.140]   what the government does and what the private sector does,
[00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:11.140]   but there's a third sector,
[00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:12.260]   which we don't think enough about,
[00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:15.220]   which is the non-profit sector.
[00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:18.020]   Almost all education in this country
[00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:20.660]   is done through non-profits.
[00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:25.500]   And, you know, the for-profit sector in education,
[00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:26.780]   for that matter, in prisons,
[00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:30.940]   hasn't exactly covered itself in glory.
[00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:32.860]   Healthcare, you know, most of us are going to wind up
[00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:35.980]   going to hospitals that are run by non-profits.
[00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:39.820]   So the question I have for you is,
[00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:42.780]   does Vanguard view itself as a non-profit corporation?
[00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:46.540]   - Short answer is no.
[00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:48.060]   We actually view ourselves
[00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:53.060]   as a very profit-oriented organization,
[00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:55.500]   but we define it differently than others do.
[00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:57.340]   We don't define it in the traditional P&L.
[00:35:57.340 --> 00:35:59.260]   We actually define it in
[00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:01.940]   what's the net return to our investors.
[00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:04.140]   At the end of the day, that's what matters.
[00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:08.100]   So, you know, our maniacal focus on cost over the years
[00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:11.500]   is to make sure that more of what an investor earns
[00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:14.140]   in the marketplace stays with the investor.
[00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:17.020]   That's actually how we measure profitability.
[00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:19.420]   Because if you think about it, being owned by the funds,
[00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:21.940]   and therefore the clients of the funds,
[00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:24.220]   at the end of the day, they're like,
[00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:27.380]   if you do the analogy to a shareholder,
[00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:29.740]   you know, creating earnings for your shareholders,
[00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:31.060]   which is what a public company does,
[00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:33.140]   is we're trying to create earnings for our shareholders,
[00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:34.660]   which are our fund holders.
[00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:38.060]   We try to do that in the most efficient, cost-effective way.
[00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:42.100]   And frankly, when we look at success of the firm,
[00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:47.300]   you know, there were four metrics that we focused on.
[00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:51.220]   Three external, one internal.
[00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:54.540]   And the metrics were externally,
[00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:57.500]   how are our funds performing versus our competitors.
[00:36:57.500 --> 00:36:59.020]   So how do we measure up?
[00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:01.180]   Because you all have a choice.
[00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:03.580]   Be it a Vanguard fund, or you can be in an ABC fund.
[00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:06.020]   And there's thousands of funds, as we know.
[00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:07.740]   There are more funds than there are securities now.
[00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:11.060]   So it's sort of an interesting factoid.
[00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:16.060]   And so we were maniacal about that.
[00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:19.300]   The second thing that we actually measure up,
[00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:21.460]   we sometimes survey people to death,
[00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:23.780]   and we hear that, I apologize for it,
[00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:25.380]   but we wanna know what our clients think.
[00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:28.820]   So we client loyalty, and we can measure this
[00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:31.500]   both mathematically as well as through survey data.
[00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:36.300]   The mathematical measure is the redemption ratio in a fund.
[00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:39.300]   So how long do people stay in a particular fund?
[00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:41.020]   And one of the things we're really proud of
[00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:43.220]   is our fund shareholders tend to stay with us
[00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:46.420]   three times as long as the average shareholder
[00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:47.660]   in the industry.
[00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:49.180]   I'm very loyal client base.
[00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:53.860]   And then we will use survey data to reinforce that message.
[00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:56.700]   The third metric was the expense ratio.
[00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:59.860]   Because we know the one thing we could control,
[00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:03.060]   we couldn't control the absolute return in market.
[00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:04.940]   We could control our expenses,
[00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:06.940]   and so we could have a real say
[00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:08.820]   on what the net return was.
[00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:13.260]   And so we were, that goes back to 1974 to 1975
[00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:14.460]   when we launched.
[00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:16.940]   And so those three metrics, fund performance,
[00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:20.260]   client loyalty, and expense ratio,
[00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:23.580]   were how we thought about the external side.
[00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:26.380]   And in a sense, fund performance and the expense ratio,
[00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:27.860]   if you sort of look at them together,
[00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:30.660]   that is in a sense a P&L for how you're doing
[00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:31.700]   for your investors.
[00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:33.900]   By the way, you might be interested,
[00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:37.780]   the fourth metric was our employee engagement,
[00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:39.140]   crew member engagement.
[00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:43.460]   So we wanted people to think this was a great place to work.
[00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:48.340]   And despite what the Philadelphia Inquirer says occasionally,
[00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:49.780]   we actually are a great place to work.
[00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:52.460]   Our turnover is extraordinarily low,
[00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:55.460]   and we have a great group of people
[00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:56.940]   who are just dedicated to the client.
[00:38:56.940 --> 00:39:00.140]   They love the mission, they love being here.
[00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:02.900]   I can't tell you how many 25, 30 year celebrations
[00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:05.060]   I've been to in the last few years.
[00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:07.660]   People who've been here since the beginning
[00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:08.940]   or near the beginning.
[00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:12.540]   So that metric was actually really important to us as well,
[00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:14.260]   because we thought without great people,
[00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:16.620]   none of the other stuff is gonna happen.
[00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:20.100]   - Okay, well, I'd like to shift gears now a little bit,
[00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:24.540]   and talk about some more general macro issues.
[00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:26.060]   And the way I want to segue into that,
[00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:28.100]   talking about ESG investing.
[00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:32.660]   I know you're an enthusiast about that.
[00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:34.100]   You think a lot about it.
[00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:36.820]   And I'm wondering if you think about those three
[00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:40.300]   components differently.
[00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:44.540]   People tend to put them all together.
[00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:46.180]   I don't think they're the same thing.
[00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:47.660]   I think they have different sets
[00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:49.260]   of returns and considerations,
[00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:51.900]   and I'm wondering if you'd address that.
[00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:56.900]   - Yeah, so ESG is quite the buzz word,
[00:39:56.900 --> 00:40:00.500]   or buzz phrase, if you will, in the industry.
[00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:03.300]   In Europe and parts of the Pacific,
[00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:08.140]   it's actually required to be stricter
[00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:09.500]   on some of these issues.
[00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:11.260]   - I should interrupt you for a second.
[00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:13.020]   Just to say for the audience,
[00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:15.460]   you have E means environmentally conscious,
[00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:16.740]   S means socially conscious,
[00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:18.780]   and then G refers to corporate governance.
[00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:21.100]   I just should have made that clear up front, I'm sorry.
[00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:23.900]   - Yeah, so let me start with G,
[00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:25.420]   because I think that's the easiest one
[00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:27.820]   to get your hands around for governance.
[00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:31.100]   And this is the one we think we can affect the most,
[00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:32.980]   to be blunt.
[00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:34.740]   How well are companies governed?
[00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:38.900]   And this gets into board composition,
[00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:45.220]   how boards compensate their management teams,
[00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:48.940]   how boards oversee strategy, risk, and so forth.
[00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:53.940]   And we think that there's a lot of influence
[00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:56.180]   that big investors can have here.
[00:40:56.180 --> 00:40:59.980]   And what's interesting is, just sort of a side note,
[00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:02.540]   people always are like,
[00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:04.580]   "Well, you know, if you're an index shareholder,
[00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:05.420]   "what do you care?
[00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:06.860]   "You should have your own stocks.
[00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:08.380]   "Why do you care about governance?"
[00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:11.060]   And then we'll hear the follow-on is,
[00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:14.180]   "You don't care, you guys don't pay
[00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:15.660]   "a lot of attention to this."
[00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:17.820]   And before we wrote our first letter,
[00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:20.460]   Jack Brenner wrote a letter in 2005,
[00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:23.700]   I think Jack Bogle gave a speech on this in maybe 2001.
[00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:26.660]   So before that speech, before Jack Brenner wrote the letter,
[00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:30.620]   no active manager in the US, except the activists,
[00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:32.220]   we're actually talking about governance.
[00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:34.780]   Like, it was not a topic.
[00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:39.100]   And so, our view is it's a really important role
[00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:42.780]   for a shareholder, because when we first started
[00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:45.860]   this journey, board members had frankly lost
[00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:47.100]   their way a little bit.
[00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:50.740]   If you would ask a board, like I gave a speech
[00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:54.420]   on this in 2008 or 9, I said, you know,
[00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:56.460]   "Boards should engage with their big shareholders.
[00:41:56.460 --> 00:41:58.100]   "They should be willing to hear what the shareholder
[00:41:58.100 --> 00:42:00.740]   "thinks about the company and so forth,
[00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:02.660]   "about the board composition."
[00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:04.940]   And I almost got run out of the room.
[00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:08.620]   The board members said, "Why would we do that?"
[00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:10.820]   I'm like, "Who do you think you represent?"
[00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:13.820]   And there was like this stunned silence,
[00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:16.620]   and, "Oh yeah, the shareholder, yeah,
[00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:18.500]   "you guys elect us."
[00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:21.140]   So, and I say that a little bit tongue-in-cheek,
[00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:22.580]   but it's a really important concept.
[00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:25.380]   So the G is something we think we can influence.
[00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:28.820]   Now, Bill, I mean, you've done more mathematical research
[00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:31.740]   on factors and all kinds of things,
[00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:33.840]   so you probably know this better than I do.
[00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:38.020]   There is no evidence yet that, quote-unquote,
[00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:41.380]   better-governed companies perform better.
[00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:43.700]   This is one of the holy grails, is to figure out
[00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:47.020]   if any of these factors actually drive return.
[00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:49.460]   And there's lots of debate in the industry about this,
[00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:52.740]   and you'll see different interpretations of data.
[00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:54.740]   And, you know, it's hard to actually define
[00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:56.020]   what is good governance.
[00:42:56.020 --> 00:42:58.900]   We have, our notion is good governance
[00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:02.460]   is that the highest level of the board
[00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:05.380]   is doing an effective job overseeing
[00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:07.060]   talent, strategy, and risk.
[00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:09.380]   And I say overseeing the processes,
[00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:10.980]   making sure management is doing the right things,
[00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:12.660]   not actually doing a board's job
[00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:14.140]   is to govern, not to manage.
[00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:19.820]   And they're putting the shareholder interests,
[00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:21.180]   you know, right there at the top.
[00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:24.060]   Doesn't mean other stakeholders don't matter.
[00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:24.900]   We'll get to that in a minute,
[00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:26.540]   because there's been a lot written about that,
[00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:29.980]   but the shareholder really has to be in the room.
[00:43:29.980 --> 00:43:32.500]   And, you know, look, I think over time,
[00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:36.380]   we will see that better-governed companies,
[00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:38.740]   as we define them, and we find ways
[00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:40.900]   to sort of look at that mathematically
[00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:42.540]   a little bit more effectively,
[00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:44.340]   I think we will see that it does lead
[00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:45.780]   to better performance generally,
[00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:47.940]   but it won't be no guarantee.
[00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:49.100]   It will be no guarantee.
[00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:52.460]   So we're spending a lot of time on that.
[00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:55.060]   When you get into the other two factors,
[00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:57.020]   societal and environmental,
[00:43:57.020 --> 00:44:02.180]   you know, everybody's definition is very different.
[00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:04.100]   And as you know, many ESG products
[00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:07.100]   that are out there today are,
[00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:09.420]   they're what I call exclusionary.
[00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:14.340]   They screen certain names out based on certain criteria.
[00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:18.980]   So, you know, you might have a carbon footprint fund.
[00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:21.580]   So companies with high carbon footprint,
[00:44:21.580 --> 00:44:23.620]   you're not going to invest in,
[00:44:23.620 --> 00:44:25.020]   you're only gonna invest in companies
[00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:27.620]   with low carbon footprint.
[00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:31.100]   Now, there's two theories on this that are out there.
[00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:32.180]   You know, there's the,
[00:44:32.180 --> 00:44:36.940]   there's one that's, I would say, the real story,
[00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:38.860]   which is some people just want that
[00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:41.540]   and they're willing to give up potential return for it.
[00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:42.420]   That's fine.
[00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:43.660]   Actually, I think that's something
[00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:45.700]   that's an individual's choice.
[00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:47.060]   And then there are people who will say,
[00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:50.060]   we know that these, you know,
[00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:52.420]   funds will outperform in the long run.
[00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:53.540]   I don't think we know that.
[00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:55.020]   You know, again, all math we've seen
[00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:57.660]   does not necessarily suggest that.
[00:44:57.660 --> 00:45:00.180]   So it doesn't mean that the fund has no reason to exist,
[00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:02.860]   but the promise that a factor like that
[00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:04.900]   is going to lead to outperformance,
[00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:08.340]   I think is misleading at best.
[00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:12.020]   And so we're actually spending quite a bit of time
[00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:13.700]   on the topic.
[00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:19.580]   I think the, from a product standpoint, if you will,
[00:45:19.580 --> 00:45:22.380]   creating indices and so forth,
[00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:24.140]   anything that you do there,
[00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:26.980]   you've got to be very clear with investors
[00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:30.020]   about the trade-offs that they potentially are making.
[00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:32.460]   Okay, so as long as you're clear on that,
[00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:36.500]   then I think it's fine to have these kinds of vehicles.
[00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:38.260]   But I think it's incredibly misleading
[00:45:38.260 --> 00:45:41.340]   to tell people that you think they're going to outperform.
[00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:42.980]   You know, socially responsible investing
[00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:45.100]   was a big thing in the late '90s.
[00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:47.300]   And the way the screens worked
[00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:49.260]   is you had an overweight to tech.
[00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:53.540]   So 1998, 1999, you were socially responsible
[00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:55.140]   and you were outperforming the product market
[00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:56.340]   by 1,000 basis points a year,
[00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:58.260]   so everybody thought you were a hero.
[00:45:58.260 --> 00:45:59.820]   Then the tech wreck happened.
[00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:02.540]   And guess what, those products disappeared.
[00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:04.620]   People were so disappointed
[00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:07.820]   because they didn't understand actually the factors
[00:46:07.820 --> 00:46:09.820]   that they were exposed to.
[00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:12.580]   So that's the exclusionary side.
[00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:16.260]   So the more complex side is
[00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:20.420]   how do you engage with companies around these issues?
[00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:22.220]   And again, I'm going to bring you back
[00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:26.100]   to sort of our fundamental belief on governance,
[00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:28.260]   which is boards.
[00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:30.260]   Boards, you know, if you look historically,
[00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:32.580]   you would do a survey 20 years ago
[00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:34.180]   and say, "What's your primary job?"
[00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:36.180]   They would say, "Pick the CEO.
[00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:39.380]   "Pick the right CEO and all good things will happen."
[00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:40.900]   I think it's much more complex today.
[00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:43.860]   I think boards have a really important role to play
[00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:46.620]   in the oversight of not just the CEO selection,
[00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:47.460]   which is still important,
[00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:49.060]   but talent overall in the company.
[00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:51.180]   Does the company got sufficient talent
[00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:53.540]   for the evolving marketplace?
[00:46:53.540 --> 00:46:58.340]   Strategy, oversight, and risk.
[00:46:58.340 --> 00:47:00.900]   And many of these environmental
[00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:03.940]   and societal, social issues, if you will,
[00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:06.380]   fall in the risk category.
[00:47:06.380 --> 00:47:08.220]   So from a governance standpoint,
[00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:10.820]   we actually want to know how companies
[00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:13.380]   are thinking about these issues
[00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:18.260]   without necessarily saying one interpretation of,
[00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:20.940]   and let's use climate change as an example,
[00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:25.500]   we're less interested in somebody saying
[00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:27.540]   we believe the science or we don't believe the science.
[00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:30.580]   We're much more interested in a board saying,
[00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:33.820]   "Here's how we view it from a risk perspective
[00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:36.420]   "in terms of how consumers view our business,
[00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:39.380]   "how our supply chain works,
[00:47:39.380 --> 00:47:40.540]   "all of those sorts of things,
[00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:42.100]   "and here's how we're thinking about that."
[00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:44.420]   Because if there's greater clarity
[00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:48.740]   around how you interpret different types of risk,
[00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:52.940]   theoretically you have a more accurate stock price,
[00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:54.300]   if you will.
[00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:56.780]   And that kind of transparency
[00:47:56.780 --> 00:47:57.940]   we think is really necessary.
[00:47:57.940 --> 00:47:59.860]   So that's where we've been spending
[00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:02.460]   quite a bit of our time on the engagement side
[00:48:02.460 --> 00:48:04.220]   is really trying to understand
[00:48:04.220 --> 00:48:06.100]   how companies view these factors
[00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:08.060]   from a risk perspective.
[00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:09.780]   And can you learn something
[00:48:09.780 --> 00:48:12.140]   that actually makes the market,
[00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:15.020]   the pricing mechanisms work even more effectively?
[00:48:15.020 --> 00:48:18.460]   It's by no means an exact science at this point.
[00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:21.700]   And one of the things I think we're going to see
[00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:25.500]   as time goes on is there's a lot of pressure
[00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:30.020]   for shareholders to act on some of these issues
[00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:32.180]   because the government's not.
[00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:35.380]   And so you've got a lot of stakeholders out there
[00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:37.580]   who are frustrated with the lack of action
[00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:40.940]   in certain categories of these topics.
[00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:43.780]   And so they push really hard for other constituents
[00:48:43.780 --> 00:48:45.340]   to try to have an effect.
[00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:47.180]   And I think it's a very, very difficult thing
[00:48:47.180 --> 00:48:49.060]   for a shareholder to do
[00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:50.860]   because again, everybody's interpretation
[00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:52.620]   is really different.
[00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:54.580]   I'll give you just one practical example.
[00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:57.220]   So I have a great family friend.
[00:48:57.220 --> 00:48:59.780]   She's a very, very, very devout Quaker.
[00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:03.620]   Those of you familiar with Quaker beliefs,
[00:49:03.620 --> 00:49:07.900]   one of the fundamental beliefs is war cannot be tolerated.
[00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:09.620]   Just through military,
[00:49:09.620 --> 00:49:12.580]   therefore anything military related is bad.
[00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:16.580]   And so she asked me, she's young, very idealistic.
[00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:18.860]   She's like, "So what can I invest in?"
[00:49:18.860 --> 00:49:21.340]   And she started running through companies.
[00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:24.020]   And she started with some of the cool tech companies.
[00:49:24.020 --> 00:49:25.700]   And I'm like, you know, she starts with Google.
[00:49:25.700 --> 00:49:27.940]   And I'm like, "I don't think you can do that
[00:49:27.940 --> 00:49:29.420]   "if you're anti-military.
[00:49:29.420 --> 00:49:32.900]   "I mean, what do you think is doing all the satellite stuff
[00:49:32.900 --> 00:49:34.260]   "that drones are based on?"
[00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:35.900]   So she's horrified by that.
[00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:36.940]   "Well, what about Apple?
[00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:38.100]   "They make really cool stuff."
[00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:40.780]   Well, you know, look at Apple's military business.
[00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:42.860]   So by the time we worked our way through,
[00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:44.460]   I think we were down to about five companies
[00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:47.060]   out of the S&P 500 that she could invest in.
[00:49:47.060 --> 00:49:49.420]   I mean, it was really, you know,
[00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:52.300]   and I tell the story because I actually really felt
[00:49:52.300 --> 00:49:54.900]   maybe she wanted to express her beliefs
[00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:56.460]   in the way she invested.
[00:49:56.460 --> 00:49:59.100]   And she was willing to sacrifice return.
[00:49:59.100 --> 00:50:03.940]   But the problem was her definition
[00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:06.460]   of socially responsible was so broad
[00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:08.300]   that literally, I mean, Treasury Box
[00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:09.860]   would be the last thing she could own.
[00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:13.060]   So, you know, she couldn't invest.
[00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:18.060]   So, you know, to me, that's at the heart
[00:50:18.060 --> 00:50:21.740]   of all this discussion around ESG
[00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:25.020]   is everyone has a very different interpretation.
[00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:29.060]   What is environmentally sound to you
[00:50:29.060 --> 00:50:32.140]   may be very different than that.
[00:50:32.140 --> 00:50:35.660]   And how we as a provider actually get our hands around that
[00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:37.300]   is actually pretty complicated.
[00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:39.700]   - Yeah, I mean, I tend to look at it
[00:50:39.700 --> 00:50:43.500]   from a somewhat different angle.
[00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:46.060]   And I tend to separate them out.
[00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:47.340]   When I look at GE Governance,
[00:50:47.340 --> 00:50:49.220]   I see that as a positive return factor.
[00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:50.780]   I think there's pretty good data.
[00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:53.740]   There are pretty good data in the back of that.
[00:50:53.740 --> 00:50:55.940]   If you look, for example, at companies
[00:50:55.940 --> 00:50:59.620]   where the executives are spending all their time
[00:50:59.620 --> 00:51:02.620]   in private jets, flying around for personal purposes,
[00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:05.540]   they're spending $20 million for a house.
[00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:08.220]   You can actually isolate that as a negative return factor.
[00:51:08.220 --> 00:51:09.420]   You have a very big one.
[00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:11.860]   And that goes all the way back hundreds of years.
[00:51:11.860 --> 00:51:14.260]   You know, John Blunt with the South Sea Company.
[00:51:14.260 --> 00:51:17.260]   George Hudson with the English Railways.
[00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:20.780]   More recently, Adam Neufeld is a classic example,
[00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:22.300]   or is a classic example of that.
[00:51:22.300 --> 00:51:25.580]   These are bad actors that are pretty easy to identify.
[00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:28.580]   And so that's one, I think, negative selector.
[00:51:28.580 --> 00:51:31.260]   There's some more subtle things you can get out as well.
[00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:34.020]   S&G, I look at as a negative,
[00:51:34.020 --> 00:51:35.780]   strong negative return factors.
[00:51:35.780 --> 00:51:39.220]   For example, you look going back 80, 90 years.
[00:51:39.220 --> 00:51:42.740]   Alcohol, tobacco, firearms, okay?
[00:51:42.740 --> 00:51:44.380]   You know, there should be a government agency
[00:51:44.380 --> 00:51:45.660]   that deals with this, right?
[00:51:45.660 --> 00:51:46.780]   (audience laughs)
[00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:49.500]   All have held the market by 2% to 4%
[00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:52.300]   over an 80 or a 90 year period.
[00:51:52.300 --> 00:51:53.500]   And the reason is very simple.
[00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:54.980]   People avoid those companies.
[00:51:54.980 --> 00:51:58.380]   The prices will fall, their expected returns will rise.
[00:51:58.380 --> 00:52:01.220]   And so the idea that you can impact social policy
[00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:04.020]   by disinvesting in those companies makes no sense at all.
[00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:06.260]   I mean, it's more likely that those companies
[00:52:06.260 --> 00:52:09.300]   will get out of private and will escape public scrutiny.
[00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:14.300]   I've never understood it as a tool for advocacy.
[00:52:18.220 --> 00:52:20.900]   You know, and then as far as governance goes,
[00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:22.620]   I'm looking at more general concerns
[00:52:22.620 --> 00:52:24.340]   from Anne Bargh's point of view
[00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:28.020]   in terms of societal, you know, just societal,
[00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:32.420]   society and the health of the capitalist system
[00:52:32.420 --> 00:52:34.860]   where we've now evolved a compensation system
[00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:37.700]   that relies heavily on stock options,
[00:52:37.700 --> 00:52:41.220]   which really incentivizes companies
[00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:45.340]   to manipulate their short-term earnings reports
[00:52:46.340 --> 00:52:48.300]   and not to think of long-term.
[00:52:48.300 --> 00:52:51.940]   They don't embrace the Warren Buffett's theory
[00:52:51.940 --> 00:52:53.660]   of long-term readings.
[00:52:53.660 --> 00:52:57.100]   - Yeah, you know, so a couple of, just to add to that.
[00:52:57.100 --> 00:53:00.100]   So I couldn't agree with you more on the, you know,
[00:53:00.100 --> 00:53:03.940]   your observations around the E and the S,
[00:53:03.940 --> 00:53:05.180]   at least historically.
[00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:08.300]   So no question that those, you know,
[00:53:08.300 --> 00:53:12.940]   the companies in the industry as you listed have outperformed.
[00:53:12.940 --> 00:53:15.540]   And again, this is part of why when we talk to people
[00:53:15.540 --> 00:53:18.740]   about doing some of these exclusionary screens,
[00:53:18.740 --> 00:53:20.180]   we really try to remind them
[00:53:20.180 --> 00:53:22.060]   that you are likely giving up return
[00:53:22.060 --> 00:53:24.900]   and just understand that as an investor.
[00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:28.260]   So 100% agreement there.
[00:53:28.260 --> 00:53:31.240]   You know, on the governance side,
[00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:34.900]   one of the really important things we think
[00:53:34.900 --> 00:53:38.940]   is the emergence of Vanguard
[00:53:38.940 --> 00:53:42.500]   and, you know, other index providers
[00:53:42.500 --> 00:53:47.380]   is actually changing some of the dynamic.
[00:53:47.380 --> 00:53:49.580]   And it's actually, I think, positive change.
[00:53:49.580 --> 00:53:52.180]   I think it's still very early innings.
[00:53:52.180 --> 00:53:54.340]   Again, this is something Jack Bowman and I
[00:53:54.340 --> 00:53:58.260]   spoke quite a bit about during the last couple of years
[00:53:58.260 --> 00:54:03.260]   because it was, this is a real sea change.
[00:54:03.260 --> 00:54:07.140]   And here's the heart of the issue.
[00:54:07.140 --> 00:54:11.500]   So we talk, everybody talks about long-termism.
[00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:14.860]   So, you know, you look at a lot of your traditional funds
[00:54:14.860 --> 00:54:16.820]   and traditional managers,
[00:54:16.820 --> 00:54:18.860]   look at the portfolio turnover.
[00:54:18.860 --> 00:54:22.260]   It belies the idea that they're long-term.
[00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:24.820]   Most active funds, on average,
[00:54:24.820 --> 00:54:27.700]   active fund turnover is about 80%.
[00:54:27.700 --> 00:54:29.380]   Even if you factor, if you say,
[00:54:29.380 --> 00:54:31.180]   okay, let's just do name turnover.
[00:54:31.180 --> 00:54:32.700]   Name turnover is over 50%.
[00:54:32.700 --> 00:54:35.300]   So that means the holding period is less than two years.
[00:54:35.300 --> 00:54:38.660]   So when somebody who says I'm really long-term oriented,
[00:54:38.660 --> 00:54:40.060]   they're not, okay?
[00:54:40.060 --> 00:54:42.580]   And that's where a lot of the pressure has come from.
[00:54:42.580 --> 00:54:45.300]   So I agree with your observation there
[00:54:45.300 --> 00:54:46.860]   on the short-termism.
[00:54:46.860 --> 00:54:48.020]   Here's the difference.
[00:54:48.020 --> 00:54:51.300]   For our index holdings, we can't sell a stock
[00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:53.580]   if we don't like what's going on in the company.
[00:54:53.580 --> 00:54:56.580]   We are a permanent shareholder.
[00:54:56.580 --> 00:54:59.140]   And what's interesting is we're now having
[00:54:59.140 --> 00:55:02.020]   those discussions with companies.
[00:55:02.020 --> 00:55:04.740]   And it's a very different set of discussions
[00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:06.460]   than what they're used to.
[00:55:06.460 --> 00:55:10.620]   Because we can't just, if we don't like what we hear,
[00:55:10.620 --> 00:55:12.580]   we just can't go home and say let's just get out of this
[00:55:12.580 --> 00:55:15.900]   and go pick another company in the sector and be happy.
[00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:20.100]   So active engagement with boards and independent directors
[00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:22.060]   has become a big thing.
[00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:25.500]   We'll probably do 1,100 engagements this year,
[00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:27.580]   and that number's just gonna keep growing.
[00:55:27.580 --> 00:55:29.940]   And most of it is around this notion
[00:55:29.940 --> 00:55:33.100]   of what's it mean to be a permanent shareholder,
[00:55:33.100 --> 00:55:36.620]   and how can you, as an organization,
[00:55:36.620 --> 00:55:41.620]   better align yourself with a permanent sense of capital.
[00:55:41.620 --> 00:55:46.340]   And it doesn't mean that short-term actors
[00:55:46.340 --> 00:55:49.980]   have no place in this universe,
[00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:51.980]   but they shouldn't have an outside voice.
[00:55:51.980 --> 00:55:53.020]   They should not have an outside voice.
[00:55:53.020 --> 00:55:56.060]   If somebody owns 1% of a company
[00:55:56.060 --> 00:55:58.540]   and wants them to spin this division,
[00:55:58.540 --> 00:56:00.580]   merge this thing and do this and do this
[00:56:00.580 --> 00:56:03.940]   to jack up the stock price for the quarter,
[00:56:03.940 --> 00:56:06.580]   if that's detrimental to our long-term,
[00:56:06.580 --> 00:56:08.420]   the long-term value of the company,
[00:56:08.420 --> 00:56:10.740]   we're actually gonna stand against that
[00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:13.660]   from a government standpoint.
[00:56:13.660 --> 00:56:17.500]   And we're beginning to have a much,
[00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:19.820]   I would say there's a much more,
[00:56:19.820 --> 00:56:21.900]   there's a much larger voice.
[00:56:21.900 --> 00:56:24.300]   Now it's really, the challenge, of course,
[00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:26.460]   is as you can well imagine,
[00:56:26.460 --> 00:56:28.180]   everybody wants to politicize that voice
[00:56:28.180 --> 00:56:33.060]   as quickly as they can and push social agenda
[00:56:33.060 --> 00:56:35.940]   and political issues as opposed to economic issues.
[00:56:35.940 --> 00:56:38.020]   And so the way we deal with that
[00:56:38.020 --> 00:56:41.540]   is when somebody, let's say somebody on the S,
[00:56:41.540 --> 00:56:44.140]   an activist, a social activist,
[00:56:44.140 --> 00:56:46.420]   comes to us with an idea,
[00:56:46.420 --> 00:56:47.700]   our first question is,
[00:56:47.700 --> 00:56:50.420]   show us the link to long-term value creation,
[00:56:50.420 --> 00:56:52.340]   and we'll have a discussion.
[00:56:52.340 --> 00:56:54.700]   So if you're writing a proposal to a board
[00:56:54.700 --> 00:56:56.020]   to be considered for the shareholders,
[00:56:56.020 --> 00:56:58.140]   we wanna see the link to long-term value creation
[00:56:58.140 --> 00:57:00.020]   and if there's a link, we're gonna listen.
[00:57:00.020 --> 00:57:02.180]   We may disagree, but we're at least gonna listen.
[00:57:02.180 --> 00:57:03.060]   If there's no link,
[00:57:03.060 --> 00:57:04.700]   we're not gonna really spend a lot of time on it.
[00:57:04.700 --> 00:57:07.940]   So that's kind of how we're trying to handle this, Bill,
[00:57:07.940 --> 00:57:11.140]   and again, it's very new territory.
[00:57:11.140 --> 00:57:13.740]   You can imagine these are tricky issues to deal with.
[00:57:13.740 --> 00:57:18.420]   The fundamental underlying principle, though,
[00:57:18.420 --> 00:57:21.700]   is what's in the interest of our long-term investors,
[00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:24.340]   because again, as I started by saying,
[00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:27.900]   we have investors who tend to stay with us
[00:57:27.900 --> 00:57:30.060]   for a very long period of time,
[00:57:30.060 --> 00:57:33.780]   and therefore, and then in our index funds in particular,
[00:57:33.780 --> 00:57:35.100]   but also many of our active funds
[00:57:35.100 --> 00:57:37.940]   have very low turnover relative to their peers.
[00:57:37.940 --> 00:57:41.420]   We are, by definition, a long-term shareholder,
[00:57:41.420 --> 00:57:42.620]   if not a permanent shareholder,
[00:57:42.620 --> 00:57:43.980]   and we need to reflect that
[00:57:43.980 --> 00:57:47.700]   and we need to reflect those values.
[00:57:47.700 --> 00:57:49.700]   - Do you or can you even speak to
[00:57:49.700 --> 00:57:52.180]   how well you coordinate with BlackRock?
[00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:55.020]   - So we don't coordinate with BlackRock.
[00:57:55.020 --> 00:57:57.820]   To be blunt, we can't.
[00:57:57.820 --> 00:57:59.460]   We deal with all kinds of antitrust issues,
[00:57:59.460 --> 00:58:02.740]   and frankly, I shouldn't say this, but I will,
[00:58:02.740 --> 00:58:04.300]   'cause you guys are friends.
[00:58:04.300 --> 00:58:05.860]   (audience laughs)
[00:58:05.860 --> 00:58:07.460]   What BlackRock says and what BlackRock does
[00:58:07.460 --> 00:58:09.380]   are sometimes very different.
[00:58:09.380 --> 00:58:11.140]   We try to do what we actually say.
[00:58:11.140 --> 00:58:13.980]   (audience laughs)
[00:58:13.980 --> 00:58:17.700]   And again, I pay a lot of attention to what they say,
[00:58:17.700 --> 00:58:20.380]   because they actually say some important things,
[00:58:20.380 --> 00:58:22.100]   and they're very influential.
[00:58:22.100 --> 00:58:26.140]   But I think how you, if you look at, for example,
[00:58:26.140 --> 00:58:29.100]   how we compensate active managers.
[00:58:29.100 --> 00:58:31.220]   So I've spent most of the time talking on index.
[00:58:31.220 --> 00:58:32.540]   I think all of you know,
[00:58:32.540 --> 00:58:35.780]   'cause we get notes from you all the time,
[00:58:35.780 --> 00:58:39.380]   that all of our active managers
[00:58:39.380 --> 00:58:40.900]   are under incentive contracts
[00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:43.580]   where it's longer-term performance
[00:58:43.580 --> 00:58:45.820]   that's rewarded, not short-term performance.
[00:58:45.820 --> 00:58:49.020]   And by the way, it's perfectly symmetrical.
[00:58:49.020 --> 00:58:50.580]   If they underperform, they get paid less.
[00:58:50.580 --> 00:58:52.660]   If they outperform, they get paid more.
[00:58:52.660 --> 00:58:57.020]   And what that does is it sets them to think longer-term.
[00:58:57.020 --> 00:58:58.460]   Most of them are on a three-year,
[00:58:58.460 --> 00:59:00.340]   I would like to see it go to five.
[00:59:00.340 --> 00:59:02.980]   We have a couple, I think, we've managed to do that.
[00:59:02.980 --> 00:59:06.980]   That's very different than anybody else in the industry.
[00:59:06.980 --> 00:59:09.020]   So people will talk about long-term, long-term, long-term,
[00:59:09.020 --> 00:59:10.460]   and then you look at how they incentivize
[00:59:10.460 --> 00:59:13.060]   portfolio managers, and you look at how they act,
[00:59:13.060 --> 00:59:14.940]   how they actually act, it's quite different.
[00:59:14.940 --> 00:59:19.940]   So for me, so we don't coordinate with them.
[00:59:19.940 --> 00:59:22.340]   We certainly pay attention to what they say.
[00:59:22.340 --> 00:59:23.900]   We pay attention to what State Street says.
[00:59:23.900 --> 00:59:26.100]   We pay attention to what Tia Krupp says.
[00:59:26.100 --> 00:59:29.140]   All of these organizations have intelligent,
[00:59:29.140 --> 00:59:31.820]   thoughtful, constructive things to say on this topic.
[00:59:31.820 --> 00:59:34.580]   So you've gotta be a student of what they say.
[00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:39.180]   But we're trying to carve our own way here.
[00:59:39.180 --> 00:59:41.220]   Frankly, again, with all humility,
[00:59:41.220 --> 00:59:43.100]   the guy who runs this for us, Glenn Warren,
[00:59:43.100 --> 00:59:47.100]   is considered by most people in the industry to be the best.
[00:59:47.100 --> 00:59:48.980]   So frankly, people pay a lot of attention
[00:59:48.980 --> 00:59:51.940]   to what Glenn says and what he does.
[00:59:51.940 --> 00:59:55.260]   And I think we're actually able to effect change
[00:59:55.260 --> 00:59:59.660]   a little bit more greatly than even our direct influence
[00:59:59.660 --> 01:00:02.140]   because of Glenn's thoughtfulness here.
[01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:05.540]   - On a lighter note, did you happen to see
[01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:08.180]   Michael Burry's interview with Bloomberg?
[01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:13.180]   Okay, just as a, Michael Burry was the hero of The Big Short.
[01:00:13.180 --> 01:00:18.740]   This autistic ex-neurologist who called
[01:00:18.940 --> 01:00:22.900]   the financial crisis by, was he, he loved reading
[01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:25.460]   corporate bond offering statements.
[01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:27.900]   And he went on record as saying that
[01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:31.620]   markets have grown terribly inefficient
[01:00:31.620 --> 01:00:34.340]   because of indexing and he thought that there was
[01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:37.740]   an outsized play and undervalued small value stocks
[01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:40.420]   and Japanese stocks and these hundred dollar bills
[01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:42.500]   lying in the ground and he was gonna be describing
[01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:44.380]   how he was gonna be picking them up.
[01:00:44.380 --> 01:00:46.940]   I wonder how you responded to that.
[01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:51.940]   - With a chuckle, you know, look, he's,
[01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:55.100]   you know, I think he's becoming an active manager.
[01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:57.740]   So, you know, it's a story.
[01:00:57.740 --> 01:00:59.340]   So I would say two things.
[01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:03.180]   One, you know, so let's like look at the practical part.
[01:01:03.180 --> 01:01:04.180]   Is indexing the bubble?
[01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:06.060]   I don't think so at all.
[01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:08.500]   You know, the difference between the financial crisis
[01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:11.860]   that he, you know, didn't talk quite eloquently about
[01:01:11.860 --> 01:01:15.460]   in his own way was, you know, one of the most
[01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:17.980]   important elements of that was massive, massive,
[01:01:17.980 --> 01:01:20.140]   massive amounts of leverage, right?
[01:01:20.140 --> 01:01:22.540]   So the leverage was a critical component there.
[01:01:22.540 --> 01:01:26.380]   There's no leverage in investing, right?
[01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:29.540]   In what we do at the index side where we're purely agents.
[01:01:29.540 --> 01:01:32.380]   So the fact that there's no leverage
[01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:34.620]   actually removes a lot of risk.
[01:01:34.620 --> 01:01:37.260]   And frankly, if you think about it,
[01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:39.060]   because we're not a proprietary investor,
[01:01:39.060 --> 01:01:43.080]   we're an agency, you're the ones who bear all risk.
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:46.020]   Like, you know, index goes up, you do well.
[01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:48.020]   Index goes down, you don't do as well.
[01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:50.220]   That's very different than what was going on
[01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:53.300]   during the financial crisis where proprietary positions
[01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:56.700]   were really what was driving so much of what went on.
[01:01:56.700 --> 01:02:00.360]   So I think the analogy is very weak.
[01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:05.360]   Now, to his observations that value stocks
[01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:09.420]   may be actually really valuable today,
[01:02:09.420 --> 01:02:12.460]   I'm much more agnostic about, you know,
[01:02:12.460 --> 01:02:17.200]   I think there has been a massive premium put on growth.
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:20.380]   You know, we are at the longest period in history
[01:02:20.380 --> 01:02:22.440]   of value underperformance.
[01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:26.220]   And, you know, if you look at sort of value versus growth,
[01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:30.480]   you see these tremendous waves over time
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:34.500]   where one outperforms usually for much longer
[01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:38.540]   than one expects, but they usually cross.
[01:02:38.540 --> 01:02:39.660]   This is the longest period
[01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:42.100]   where we've seen growth outperform.
[01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:44.540]   I would argue, and again, I'd be really interested
[01:02:44.540 --> 01:02:47.180]   because you've written a lot about factors
[01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:50.300]   and you've thought about this probably more deeply
[01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:53.220]   than I have, but I think when you look
[01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:56.380]   at macroeconomic policy and its impact
[01:02:56.380 --> 01:03:01.380]   on the capital markets, it's actually really reinforced
[01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:04.020]   the importance of growth.
[01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:06.780]   And so I think growth stocks have been bid up as a result
[01:03:06.780 --> 01:03:07.780]   because, you know, we've lived
[01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:11.620]   in this very low growth economic time.
[01:03:11.620 --> 01:03:15.900]   So investors have put a huge premium on finding growth,
[01:03:15.900 --> 01:03:17.700]   you know, some level of growth.
[01:03:17.700 --> 01:03:20.180]   And what that's done is it's really driven the price
[01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:25.180]   of growth stocks to a level, or the gap between growth stocks
[01:03:25.180 --> 01:03:27.380]   and value stocks to a level we've not seen.
[01:03:27.380 --> 01:03:30.660]   Usually those sorts of things
[01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:32.500]   do eventually reverse themselves.
[01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:34.300]   So that's where, you know, again,
[01:03:34.300 --> 01:03:37.220]   I look at what Barry's saying on that front
[01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:41.300]   and it's somewhat interesting when and how that all happens.
[01:03:41.300 --> 01:03:44.180]   I don't know, you know, we are in unprecedented territory
[01:03:44.180 --> 01:03:46.340]   in terms of central bank intervention
[01:03:46.340 --> 01:03:49.820]   and that shows no signs of abatement.
[01:03:49.820 --> 01:03:53.820]   And I think that's actually distorted the markets
[01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:55.420]   to a large degree.
[01:03:55.420 --> 01:03:56.340]   This is a personal opinion,
[01:03:56.340 --> 01:03:57.740]   not necessarily a Baker opinion,
[01:03:57.740 --> 01:04:01.860]   but I think what's gone on both at the Fed
[01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:06.540]   and in central banks in terms of monetary policies
[01:04:06.540 --> 01:04:10.180]   is so unprecedented, we've not gotten back to normal.
[01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:14.100]   And, you know, there is a sense among the central banks
[01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:18.780]   that they can make economies more recession proof
[01:04:18.780 --> 01:04:20.540]   than their predecessors could.
[01:04:20.540 --> 01:04:22.220]   I'm not even sure that's a good thing, by the way,
[01:04:22.220 --> 01:04:23.940]   'cause I think recessions are actually important,
[01:04:23.940 --> 01:04:25.180]   go back to Schumpeter.
[01:04:25.180 --> 01:04:29.820]   But we're living in a period
[01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:32.340]   that we've never seen this kind of intervention
[01:04:32.340 --> 01:04:34.580]   and it is definitely having distortion effects
[01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:37.860]   on the capital markets, no question in my mind.
[01:04:37.860 --> 01:04:40.980]   - Yeah, I mean, with regard to future value premiums,
[01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:44.420]   my late mother used to say, "From your lips to God's ears."
[01:04:44.420 --> 01:04:50.940]   You know, and I do see the same thing that you're seeing
[01:04:50.940 --> 01:04:55.500]   in terms of the overvaluation of the growth stocks,
[01:04:55.500 --> 01:05:00.220]   simply as being a function of low inflation
[01:05:00.220 --> 01:05:02.500]   and low interest rates, which gets to my,
[01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:05.100]   I think it's going to be my last question,
[01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:07.060]   yeah, my last question, which is,
[01:05:08.060 --> 01:05:13.060]   you know, do you see the equity risk premium
[01:05:13.060 --> 01:05:18.060]   and the risk-free rate, the two components of returns,
[01:05:18.060 --> 01:05:21.740]   risk-free rate for fixed income and the sum of that
[01:05:21.740 --> 01:05:25.780]   and the equity risk premium as historically shifted
[01:05:25.780 --> 01:05:29.540]   to lower values over the past 20 or 30 years?
[01:05:29.540 --> 01:05:34.540]   You know, until, you know, 30 or 35 years ago,
[01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:37.820]   those existed within fairly narrow bounds
[01:05:37.820 --> 01:05:41.180]   and we seem to have jumped the shark
[01:05:41.180 --> 01:05:43.340]   in terms of lowering both of those values.
[01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:45.900]   Now, how many of you think that's permanent or not?
[01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:47.860]   (mimics explosion)
[01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:49.020]   Sorry, two of you.
[01:05:49.020 --> 01:05:50.940]   - Yeah. (audience laughs)
[01:05:50.940 --> 01:05:53.460]   So, look, the short answer is I don't know
[01:05:53.460 --> 01:05:58.460]   because, again, you know, the policy changes
[01:05:58.460 --> 01:06:02.900]   are so profound, it's hard to see it reversing
[01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:07.900]   anytime soon, the low risk-free rate feels to me
[01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:15.460]   like a even longer term thing that we're going to live with.
[01:06:15.460 --> 01:06:18.300]   I think the equity risk premium,
[01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:19.940]   that one I'm not sure about.
[01:06:19.940 --> 01:06:21.740]   You know, I think there's a possibility
[01:06:21.740 --> 01:06:26.180]   that we'll see a return to norms there,
[01:06:26.180 --> 01:06:30.540]   but I don't know when, it's certainly a long ways out.
[01:06:30.540 --> 01:06:32.980]   But, you know, that question Bill does bring up,
[01:06:32.980 --> 01:06:35.780]   I think a really, really important notion.
[01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:38.060]   And, you know, again, you're going to have people
[01:06:38.060 --> 01:06:41.020]   far, far smarter than I am to talk about this,
[01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:44.780]   but I know if Jack were here, he'd want to remind people
[01:06:44.780 --> 01:06:48.660]   of his little formula for predicting future returns,
[01:06:48.660 --> 01:06:51.380]   which happens to correlate very closely
[01:06:51.380 --> 01:06:55.380]   with our own multivariable capital markets model,
[01:06:55.380 --> 01:06:58.420]   which has got like quantum computing going on or whatever.
[01:06:59.860 --> 01:07:03.580]   We actually, on an absolute basis,
[01:07:03.580 --> 01:07:08.340]   are expecting lower equity returns over the next decade.
[01:07:08.340 --> 01:07:13.060]   Nothing is ever a sure thing,
[01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:15.580]   but it's close to a sure thing in my view,
[01:07:15.580 --> 01:07:17.740]   just where valuations are today.
[01:07:17.740 --> 01:07:19.620]   And it's not going to be a straight line.
[01:07:19.620 --> 01:07:24.420]   So the combination of lower equity returns
[01:07:24.420 --> 01:07:27.460]   and perhaps even normal volatility,
[01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:29.660]   that's not a good combination for investors.
[01:07:30.100 --> 01:07:32.100]   Normally when we see real volatility,
[01:07:32.100 --> 01:07:32.940]   at least people are like,
[01:07:32.940 --> 01:07:35.420]   well, you know, hope that they're rewarded
[01:07:35.420 --> 01:07:37.580]   for that in the long run.
[01:07:37.580 --> 01:07:38.980]   I'm not convinced of that right now.
[01:07:38.980 --> 01:07:42.100]   Again, Bill, I don't know what your own work suggests there,
[01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:45.220]   but we think, you know,
[01:07:45.220 --> 01:07:48.220]   even if you took the equity risk premium
[01:07:48.220 --> 01:07:51.500]   as sort of what it's been historically,
[01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:55.820]   and you look at where the risk-free rate is today,
[01:07:55.820 --> 01:07:58.500]   you put those together, you get a much lower return
[01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:01.020]   than what we've seen historically.
[01:08:01.020 --> 01:08:05.460]   If it stays a little bit compressed, as you suggest,
[01:08:05.460 --> 01:08:07.700]   that's just the worst news, if you will.
[01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:10.180]   And again, I hate to be Debbie Downer on that,
[01:08:10.180 --> 01:08:11.620]   but I think as investors,
[01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:13.740]   we all have to be thinking about,
[01:08:13.740 --> 01:08:15.540]   from a portfolio allocation standpoint,
[01:08:15.540 --> 01:08:19.540]   what the implications of tenure returns are
[01:08:19.540 --> 01:08:23.260]   in terms of how we draw down when we're in retirement,
[01:08:23.260 --> 01:08:24.260]   how much we need to save
[01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:26.540]   when we're in the accumulation phase and so forth.
[01:08:26.540 --> 01:08:29.340]   I think it's actually a really, really important point.
[01:08:29.340 --> 01:08:33.180]   - Yeah, I mean, you know, it certainly feels
[01:08:33.180 --> 01:08:35.260]   as if the risk-free rate,
[01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:38.020]   the rate on fixed income assets in general,
[01:08:38.020 --> 01:08:41.460]   it's gonna be low from now out to the horizon
[01:08:41.460 --> 01:08:43.660]   and come up with any number of narratives
[01:08:43.660 --> 01:08:44.500]   of why that should be.
[01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:46.780]   But I've learned over the years not to trust narratives,
[01:08:46.780 --> 01:08:50.660]   and I also can remember 35 years ago, 40 years ago,
[01:08:50.660 --> 01:08:52.260]   when it seemed like we were going to be
[01:08:52.260 --> 01:08:55.260]   in an inflationary environment forever,
[01:08:55.260 --> 01:08:57.340]   and it was never going to end.
[01:08:57.340 --> 01:08:58.700]   So.
[01:08:58.700 --> 01:09:00.260]   - Yeah, I think, you know, I think just to--
[01:09:00.260 --> 01:09:01.100]   - It's hard to tell.
[01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:03.660]   - Yeah, I couldn't agree with you more.
[01:09:03.660 --> 01:09:05.740]   We all grew up in that inflationary period,
[01:09:05.740 --> 01:09:10.660]   and again, I remember that it was never gonna change.
[01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:13.020]   I think a lot of what, you know, I talked about,
[01:09:13.020 --> 01:09:14.780]   I sounded pretty critical of central banks,
[01:09:14.780 --> 01:09:17.340]   and look, I get what they're doing
[01:09:17.340 --> 01:09:20.580]   in the sense that the thing that they fear the most
[01:09:20.580 --> 01:09:23.660]   is deflation, because as bad as inflation can be,
[01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:27.100]   deflation, once you get into a deflationary spiral,
[01:09:27.100 --> 01:09:30.420]   it is just the death of the economy.
[01:09:30.420 --> 01:09:32.340]   And I think they've been obsessed with that.
[01:09:32.340 --> 01:09:36.780]   And when you look at the demographic factors in particular,
[01:09:36.780 --> 01:09:39.980]   you can see why people are pushing
[01:09:39.980 --> 01:09:42.620]   against doing everything possible
[01:09:42.620 --> 01:09:45.900]   to prevent deflation from setting in broadly.
[01:09:45.900 --> 01:09:49.420]   And again, I'm not enough of a demographer,
[01:09:49.420 --> 01:09:52.180]   but as you sort of look at what the data suggests,
[01:09:52.180 --> 01:09:54.900]   there's gonna be a lot of downward pressure
[01:09:54.900 --> 01:09:58.820]   because of the aging of the population and so forth globally.
[01:09:58.820 --> 01:10:02.300]   This is not a US phenomenon, it is a global phenomenon.
[01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:04.660]   And I do think that you're right, Bill,
[01:10:04.660 --> 01:10:07.460]   that that could shape the narrative for a long time now.
[01:10:07.460 --> 01:10:09.420]   - Thank you.
[01:10:09.420 --> 01:10:11.060]   - Bill and Bill, thank you so much.
[01:10:11.060 --> 01:10:14.060]   (audience applauds)
[01:10:14.060 --> 01:10:21.460]   At this time, we're gonna take a 20-minute break,
[01:10:21.460 --> 01:10:22.900]   thank you so much.
[01:10:22.900 --> 01:10:25.900]   (audience applauds)
[01:10:25.900 --> 01:10:28.500]   (upbeat music)
[01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:38.500]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
