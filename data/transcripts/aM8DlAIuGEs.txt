[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.640]   Is Jesus the only way of salvation? We addressed this question in the last
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.240]   podcast, and you established from Scripture that the answer is yes, that
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.720]   there's no salvation without embracing Christ as the one who died for our sins
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.120]   and rose again. So the logical follow-up question then is this, Pastor John, how do
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:28.480]   we know if Jesus was for real? Right. I will give you three ways to approach
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.120]   this, and I choose these three because they are all relevant for me, and I
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:43.480]   know that there are more paths into a warranted, justified confidence in the
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:50.080]   Bible and in Christ as a true Savior and the Bible as a true witness than these
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:57.560]   three, but these are the three that have had the greatest impact on me. First,
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:05.600]   the Apostle Paul treated the resurrection of Jesus as a compelling
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:15.600]   warrant for believing what Jesus said. In Acts 17, he says, "God commands all people
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.760]   everywhere to repent, because he has fixed a day on which he will judge the
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:28.240]   world in righteousness by a man whom he appointed. Of this he has given assurance
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:35.600]   to all by raising him from the dead." So Paul treated the resurrection as the
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:43.040]   means by which God gave the world assurance. My son incarnate was speaking
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:50.440]   the truth. My son in dying for sins was vindicated by his resurrection. And then,
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:58.720]   you add to that, in 1 Corinthians 15, Paul argues to his readers, and that's us
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.640]   included, that they could actually, these first readers, could actually confirm
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.760]   this claim of the resurrection, because there were people alive as he wrote. He
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:17.160]   said, first Jesus appeared to Cephas, and then he appeared to the to the eleven,
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.640]   and then he appeared to me, he said, as it were born out of time, and he
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.840]   said, and he appeared to 500 brothers at once, and then he adds this little phrase,
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:36.040]   "Most of whom are still alive." Now, why would he say that? He says that because
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.520]   he's writing about 20 years later, and he's saying to all those folks incarnate,
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:47.720]   "Look, if you want to get in a boat and go over to Antioch, or go down to Caesarea,
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:55.000]   and walk up to Jerusalem, you can find lots of people who saw Jesus alive from
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.560]   the dead. You can compare their testimonies." This is what's called
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.680]   historical control in the study of history, where there's some control. Paul
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.120]   is not speaking in Narnia. He's not speaking in some mythological Mount
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.080]   Olympus, where nobody can check out anything that he says. He's speaking
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.400]   right there in the midst of history, where the people who were involved in
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.360]   the incidents themselves were still alive. And so the first way that Paul
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:29.840]   credits his testimony and the testimony of Jesus is by saying, "He rose from the
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:36.440]   dead. I saw him. I know him." And therefore he vindicated his work and his word.
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:42.680]   The second approach is one that C.S. Lewis helped me so much with, and he's
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:50.400]   helped thousands. Liar, lunatic, or lord. In other words, he points out that if you
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:58.480]   read the Gospels, you find Jesus saying the absolutely most outlandish things. "If
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:04.200]   you've seen me, you've seen the Father, God. I will come in my Father's glory
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.800]   with holy angels. If you don't love me more than you love your mother or father,
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:15.480]   you're not worthy of me." You've heard that the Old Testament said, "But I say,"
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.840]   claiming equal and greater authority to the Old Testament. "No one takes my life
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:26.640]   from me. I lay it down, and if I lay it down, I can take it up again. The Son of
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:34.280]   Man must suffer, and three days I'm going to rise again. Before Abraham was, I am."
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:42.280]   Those are things that he said, "This man is either crazy, or he's a liar, or
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.280]   he's lord." And as you get to know Jesus, this is the way it works for me, Tony, as you
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:53.960]   get to know Jesus, you just can't with any integrity say, "He's a liar," or "He's a
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.920]   charlatan. He's trying to pull the wool over people's eyes." And so people are
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:05.680]   confronted when they read the Gospels, "Is this man true? Is he a liar? Is he a
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:12.640]   lunatic?" And if the Holy Spirit is at work, people cannot bring themselves to say, "I
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:18.920]   think Jesus is just a plain old liar. He's just a plain crazy man." And so to me, it
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:23.600]   works that way for Jesus, and it works that way for the Apostle Paul. I read 13
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.800]   letters of the Apostle Paul, and he makes these outlandish claims for Jesus, and I
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:33.120]   say, "Well, either Paul's a liar, or he's crazy, or he's true." And I got to know
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:38.720]   Paul over the years, and I cannot bring myself to reject the Apostle Paul as a
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:47.160]   faithful testimony. Isn't this the way, Tony, we all live? How do you
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:52.820]   decide whom to trust? Well, you get to know somebody, you listen to them long
[00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:57.760]   enough, you watch them act long enough, and you say, "That person's reliable." And I
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:02.960]   think it basically works that way for Jesus and for Paul. And the last
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:08.240]   thing I would say, the third thing, is simply to point out that Jesus said in
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:17.880]   John 7, 17, "If anyone's will is to do God's will, he will know whether the
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.560]   teaching is from God, or whether I'm speaking on my own authority." Which
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:30.600]   means that for most people, the obstacle to recognizing truth in the words of
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:40.480]   Jesus is not intellectual. It's they don't want their will to be jeopardized.
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:45.360]   They don't want to stop being master of their own souls. They don't want to have
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:51.360]   to change their wills, and they can smell that in this Jesus is such an authority
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:56.200]   that if they were to yield to the truth of what he says, it's going to mean a
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:01.760]   deep transformation in their own souls. Jesus said in John 5, 44, "How can you
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:07.480]   believe who seek glory from one another, and do not seek the glory that comes
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:11.440]   from God?" Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for listening to this podcast.
