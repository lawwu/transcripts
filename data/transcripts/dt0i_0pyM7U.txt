[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.280]   A lot of fun. Yesterday was fun for a few minutes.
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.680]   All right. So last Thursday, the S&P 500 was up 2.5 percent. All right. We're feeling good.
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:28.260]   Friday, it was down 3.6 percent. Yesterday, S&P 500 up 3 percent. Today, down 3 percent
[00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.840]   and going lower faster at a fast pace, right? The crazy thing is, this is actually kind
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.360]   of normal for a downturn. John, put the chart on of this volatility chart here. So what
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.160]   this shows is like the rolling 30-day volatility. Think of this as like the VIX. You see the
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.280]   dotted line there, Duncan. That's the average. You can see any time you see a big spike,
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.080]   you see these green and red dots on this chart. Now, what this is is the 25 best days since
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.760]   1990 and the 25 worst days in the market since 1990. And what you'll notice is they all happen
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.040]   at the same time. They all happen when volatility spikes. When volatility spikes, you see big
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.240]   up days and big down days. Now, this is nothing like we saw in March 2020. We saw a string
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:17.200]   in March 2020 of minus 8 percent, plus 5, minus 5, minus 10, plus 9, minus 12, plus
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.880]   6, minus 5 in consecutive days, right? So this back and forth, back and forth, right?
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.280]   It's the Michael Scott snip-snap, snip-snap. So why does this happen, right? Why, when
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.320]   we see a downturn, does this happen? Because we're human. Phil Perlman had this quote today.
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.680]   I think it was an old tweet of his. He said, here's the thing about behavioral finance.
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.440]   People are crazy. And losing money is no fun. And losing money drives people crazy, right?
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.080]   So people panic when they're losing money. So they panic buy and they panic sell, which
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.280]   leads to these huge wild swings in price in both directions. Now, you could say, hey,
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.760]   it's the algos fault, right? But the thing is, this has been happening in every bear
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.920]   market in history. The algos just might be speeding up and making it go a little faster.
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.760]   But unfortunately, this is the way that it works.
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.480]   Sorry, Duncan. That's all I got.
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.320]   I was about to say, so it seems like we just need to look at that chart and you just figure
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:14.400]   out when you buy and sell based on where those dots are, right? So you just map that to future
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.400]   moves.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.440]   Yeah, sure. That's the problem, is that no bear market in history is going to tell you
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.560]   like the entry point of, okay, now it's over. Because these things that have never happened
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.040]   before continue to happen all the time. People said in March 2020, we bottomed on like a
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.300]   9% up day or something. And people said, you don't bottom on days like this. Those big
[00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.160]   up days like that doesn't happen. And that was the bottom. And so good luck guessing
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.680]   is my only words of comfort.
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.880]   Remember, if you have a question, askcompoundshow@gmail.com. One of these weeks, we're gonna have more comfort
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.320]   for you. All right, let's go to the first question here. I think this is probably a
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.720]   position a lot of people are in right now, as they look at their stock portfolios.
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.560]   Yep. So this person, shout out Nick Majulie right off the bat. I was reading Nick's book,
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.200]   Just Keep Buying, and the chapter on why you shouldn't buy individual stocks reinforced
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.080]   my recent feeling that I need to change up some of my investments. In my workplace retirement
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.720]   account, I have 50% of my balance, about $200,000 in a brokerage link account where I own a
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.640]   number of individual companies. Some have been winners, but recently a lot have been
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.000]   losers. We all feel you there, I think. I have learned my lesson that picking winners
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.940]   is hard. Do you have any recommendations on a strategy to rebalance my account into ETFs?
[00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.240]   Is it best to just sell everything and buy new?
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.440]   All right, so we did have Nick on the show a couple weeks ago and talked about how tough
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.480]   it is to pick winners. I think one of the stats we didn't talk about at the time, Sam
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.820]   Rowe at the TKer, he's been a guest on the Compounded Friends before. He had this great
[00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.960]   stat a couple weeks ago, said that since January 1995, 728 tickers have been added to the S&P
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:46.560]   500, while 724 have been removed. And I honestly think this is one of the reasons that the
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.800]   stock market itself is so hard to beat. It's not like an index fund is anything special.
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.440]   It's tax efficient, it's low cost, it's low turnover, but it also holds the winners and
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.320]   it gets rid of the losers. And I think people have a hard time doing that in their brains.
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.560]   So the fact that people finally realize, "Okay, I'm going to make a C change. This is it.
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:10.680]   I realize stock picking is not for me." The only advice I would give off the bat is don't
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.760]   get into this habit of changing your financial plan every time things are going well. So
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.560]   in 2020, stock picks are looking good, so I'm just going to funnel all my new retirement
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.640]   money into stock picks. And now when it's looking bad, I'm just going to funnel all
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.080]   my money into index funds and ETFs. I think you just have to pick one and stick with it.
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.080]   Pick an allocation, give yourself an allocation to stock picking if you still want that, but
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.720]   don't change it willy-nilly all the time. So the options are, you rip the bandaid off
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.280]   and you just do it. The good thing about this is that it's in a workplace retirement plan.
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.840]   Typically selling in a brokerage account involves thinking about taxes, right? And in this case,
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.560]   if you had losses, you could just take some of those and offset the gains. The fact that
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.760]   it's going through a brokerage-linked account to a retirement account makes it easier because
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.200]   you're not having to worry about taxes. So you could just sell it all at once. Put that
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.560]   money into four or five low-cost ETFs. Could be a target date fund, maybe like one of those
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.440]   Vanguard lifestyle strategy funds where they handle the asset allocation and rebalancing
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.720]   for you. I mean, check the options at your 401(k) provider first. The most important
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.880]   determinant of success for these things is typically all else equal. Choose the funds
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.880]   with the lowest fees. That's going to be your highest predictor of success. And the other
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.940]   option would be, so if that's the case, I'm totally out of picking stocks, right? I think
[00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.240]   I retired, what, three months ago, Duncan, from picking stocks?
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.240]   Something like that, yeah.
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.840]   I put my retirement in. I might do a Michael Jordan comeback at number 45 at some day.
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.480]   I'm still holding some individual stocks.
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.120]   When Zillow comes back, you're going to be a champion.
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.460]   I might have one stock that's up this year. All the other five of them are getting smoked.
[00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:36.080]   So I'm with everyone else here, my stock picking. But I put like five or 10% of my portfolio
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.760]   into this, and I have fun and it's entertaining. And I know that's what it's for. Everything
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.480]   else is automated, rules-based. So I think you can give yourself some play money if you
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.760]   want to keep 5, 10, 15%, whatever it is, and hold on some of those stocks you want to keep
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.720]   as winners so you don't kick yourself if you sell them. Just, again, don't get in the habit
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.440]   of going all in and all out.
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.680]   So I do think this is a good lesson for a lot of people, though, that 2020 was an aberration,
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.200]   and picking stocks wasn't as easy as it looked back then.
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:05.180]   Yeah, I mean, there was a time when it was just like a strategy. People were just buying
[00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:10.480]   every stock before earnings, and they were all just going up after earnings pretty much.
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:13.720]   I love this company. I'm going to buy this stock. Hey, look, it did well. It doesn't
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:19.400]   always work that well, unfortunately. It's always not going to be that easy. So yeah.
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.400]   It's just, yeah. Probably rip the bandaid off and do it.
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:27.440]   I have a little follow-up to that, which is you always hear about the virtue of patience
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:32.680]   in the market. So what's a good indication of when you know you need to make a change?
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.520]   When should you let something ride versus when should you make changes?
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.960]   This is why rules of thumb are so hard in the markets, because you hear like, "Listen,
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.320]   to be like George Soros, you have to be flexible and make changes all the time." But it's like,
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.120]   "No, to be like John Bogle, you have to stick with your plan no matter what, come hell or
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:50.080]   high water." And then it's like, "The first loss is the best loss," right? Then it's like,
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.800]   "No, no, no. You have to stick with everything no matter what."
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:57.040]   So everything in investing is kind of counterintuitive and sort of offsets one another. A lot of
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:01.240]   it depends on what you want to get out of this strategy. And if you really think you
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:05.560]   have an edge in picking stocks, or again, if you're just doing it for fun. So are you
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:09.500]   doing this your entire portfolio? Then you better have a damn good strategy and reason
[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:14.920]   for it and reason to stick with it and discipline. And the idea of, "Okay, if I'm going to stick
[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:18.280]   with this strategy, you should probably be willing -- like, would you be willing to plug
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.600]   your nose and put more money into these stocks now?" Or you're like, "I'm just going to wait
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.680]   and see." Maybe you don't have enough faith in your own system to keep following it. And
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:30.040]   I think that's a big part of it, too, is understanding if your own system -- like, everyone's strategy
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:35.520]   is going to go through periods of rough performance. There's no denying that. Everyone does. Warren
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.480]   Buffett does. Cathie Wood does. Every great investor in history has a bad period. I think
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:43.240]   you just have to figure out, "Are you willing to stick through?" That's probably the biggest
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:47.760]   thing Buffett has done over the years. He has a strategy he sticks with, come hell or
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:48.760]   high water.
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:52.880]   He got a lot of flack for selling off airlines back during the pandemic, right? But now,
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:57.200]   I guess, it seems like people are kind of over that.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:01.600]   Yeah. And to his credit, he came back and Berkshire is doing one of the best-performing
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:02.600]   stocks this year.
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:03.600]   Yep.
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:04.600]   Let's do another one.
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:09.560]   Okay. Up next, we have, "Me and my wife have an apartment in the city center, which we
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:15.560]   bought three years ago. We are currently renting it out and we're able to buy a house and cover
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:19.600]   both mortgage payments with the rent money. However, due to a crazy housing market, we
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:24.160]   could sell our apartment, pay off all mortgages, keep our house mortgage-free, and pocket an
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:29.040]   extra $100,000 in profits to invest. Which is better, continue with the rental and have
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:34.060]   others pay for our mortgage, but deal with all the risks that come with renters and renovation,
[00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:36.720]   or invest in ETFs and be exposed to market volatility?"
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:41.200]   It's interesting. The first question dealt with changing a financial plan because big
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:45.800]   losses. This is, "Should we change our financial plan because we're dealing with big gains?"
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:50.720]   I think it's interesting. Sometimes, circumstances change and the financial markets force your
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:53.920]   hand to make a decision like this. And I think for a lot of people, this has to be very tempting.
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:57.640]   If you own a rental property and you have all this equity built up, it's got to be very
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:01.760]   tempting to cash out and do something else with this. I think the biggest question is,
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.880]   "What's your tolerance for complexity here?" The good news is you already know what it's
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:09.040]   like to be a landlord, but have you experienced the downside of that? Having the hot water
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:14.480]   heater break, having the high cost of maintenance, property taxes go up, that sort of thing.
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:18.240]   Maybe all that stuff doesn't matter when you consider how much equity you've earned, but
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:22.880]   I guess there are some pros to owning real estate. I think people have figured out. There's
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:26.360]   low volatility in the price. There's no flash crashes in housing. There's no daily market
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:29.680]   prices to check. You could check on Zillow, but it's not like it changes the stock market.
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:34.080]   You're not going to be up 5% one day and down 5% the next day. It's just tangible assets.
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:38.400]   I think some people are just more comfortable with that, whether that makes sense or not.
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:41.560]   And then you have regular income potentially coming in if you have tenants locked in. And
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:45.680]   then, of course, the equity piece, if housing prices continue to rise, you could continue
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:49.840]   to make more money and do it on a levered basis. The cons here, you have these really
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:53.680]   high idiosyncratic risks. You could lose your tenants. You could have damage to the property.
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:58.320]   You could have just your neighborhood that you're in or the local economy goes bad, even
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:03.520]   if the rest of the country does fine. And you can't really spend rental property besides
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:07.920]   your income. And the returns are probably lower than you think when you count property
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:11.600]   taxes, maintenance, upkeep, property management, borrowing costs, all these things. And then,
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:15.480]   of course, if you're owning one rental property, your diversification is basically nil. You
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:21.200]   have an apartment and a house. So I'd like to think of investing through this regret
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:24.920]   minimization framework. What would I regret more, paying off the mortgage and missing
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:32.080]   out on potentially more equity or paying it off, having that feeling of being free, having
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:36.760]   some extra money, and then not having to worry about finding tenants ever again? I doubt
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:41.680]   many people regret paying off their mortgage, even if it's a very low hurdle rate. And if
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.280]   you put it in a spreadsheet, it doesn't make sense. I'm not sure how many people would
[00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:48.400]   say, "I paid off my mortgage. I'm free and clear of debt, but I really regret it." I
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:53.660]   don't think people do that. So, yes, rates are low, but it's probably hard to have that
[00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:56.720]   peace of mind. I think as long as you're up -- you're okay foregoing potential price gains
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:00.240]   and living with more volatility in the financial markets, this is probably about as good as
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:03.800]   time of any to do something like this and take it off the table and make your life maybe
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:04.800]   a little easier.
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:10.120]   >> Yeah. No, that makes sense. One thing on that note, though, you know, I try to make
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:14.640]   myself feel better being a renter and not owning property. My wife and I moved to a
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:18.400]   new neighborhood last year, and we loved that there was this cool, like, little bar and
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:23.120]   cafe on the corner. And they're now literally destroying the building, and that entire block
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:27.000]   is gonna be under construction for the next couple of years. And so, I was like, "Oh,
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.880]   I guess that's the advantage of renting. We can just move away."
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:33.720]   >> Yeah. Yeah, you have the flexibility of your lease is up. You go somewhere else, right?
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:37.680]   So, I do think there's a big piece of that flexibility. And I think potentially paying
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:40.200]   off your mortgage is another way to get more flexibility as well.
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.200]   >> Yeah.
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.200]   >> All right. Let's do one more.
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:48.320]   >> That's good advice. Okay. So, up next, "I'm 63, retired, and living on a meager pension
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:53.520]   and Social Security. Doing okay now, but counting on my IRA in a few years. I currently have
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:58.200]   a diversified 60/40 portfolio of domestic and international stocks and bonds. I'm not
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:03.680]   thrilled with the returns that bonds are giving me, but I don't know if there's a viable alternative.
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:08.560]   Can I find attractive risk return in REITs or high-dividend stocks without sacrificing
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:13.080]   capital, or should I accept the bond portfolio for what it is and ride it out?"
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:16.380]   >> This is a question we've been getting a lot in recent years. John, throw up the first
[00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:22.160]   chart here that just compares the S&P 500 with the Vanguard REIT ETF and the Vanguard
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:29.320]   Dividend Appreciation ETF. Oh, no. Do you have the white charts one here? Yeah. Never
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:34.760]   mind. My chart was going to show that dividend stocks and REITs are down just as much as
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:41.400]   the S&P. Dividend stocks are a little less than the S&P, but REITs not down as much.
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:44.120]   I don't blame John for this. I probably forgot to include the chart. So, this is my bad.
[00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:48.000]   >> I'm not seeing it. But, yeah, we'll have to wink to this.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.240]   >> It's fine. Basically, dividend stocks are still stocks. They may not fall as much, and
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:57.960]   they're not falling as much right now. They're down 20% less than the stock market. But they're
[00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:03.040]   still going to fall. And so, there aren't many good alternatives right now. So, I think
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:07.520]   you're going to have to accept some volatility. In 1989, Peter Bernstein, the legendary investor
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:12.360]   who wrote Against the Gods, which is an amazing book on risk, laid out this idea in some investment
[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:17.260]   research journal type of periodical. He said, "What's the difference between a 60/40 portfolio
[00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:21.680]   of stocks and bonds versus 75% in stocks and 25% in cash?" And he said, "Although cash
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:25.280]   tends to have lower expected returns in bonds, we have seen that cash can hold its own against
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:29.520]   bonds 30% of the time or more when bond prices are positive, and cash will always win out
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:34.360]   over bonds when bond returns are negative." And that's now, right? So, that's why people
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:36.760]   are probably more comfortable investing in cash right now. So, now, John, you can put
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:43.160]   this table that shows a 60/40 versus 75/25. And you can see -- so, I did that from 1928
[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:47.600]   to 1921. You can see it's pretty similar. A little bit higher volatility in 75/25, but
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:52.120]   higher returns as well. And then I also looked at the period of 1950 to 1981 to show, like,
[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:56.560]   what about a rising rate environment? Because the 10-year went from 2% in 1950 to 15% by
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:01.280]   1981. And you can see the 75/25 portfolio actually outperformed because cash outperformed
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:05.560]   bonds back then. Because you get the -- because short-term rates rise and you get to reinvest
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:10.720]   and bonds have this interest rate risk. So, you get a little bit higher volatility having
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:14.780]   more stocks, but then you have this piece in cash that you know is not going to fall
[00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:18.920]   on a nominal basis, right? In cash, in this instance, I used three-month T-bills, which
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:23.320]   is basically like a savings account or money market. It is worth noting, Peter Bernstein
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:29.040]   wrote this piece in 1989. Yields were much higher. 10-year yield averaged 8.5% in 1989.
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:33.480]   Three-month T-bills sported an average yield of 8.4%. So, things were a tad easier from
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:38.560]   an income perspective back then. Right now, three-month T-bills yield about .9% or 90
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:42.560]   basis points, if we're talking finance-speak. But you can find higher yields in shorter-duration
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:45.560]   bonds today. So, the SHY that we've talked about here, Duncan, one- to three-year Treasury
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:51.040]   ETF, is now yielding 2.7%. So, you pair a shorter-duration bond fund like that with
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:56.320]   almost 3% yields with a little bit of higher proportion in stocks, I just think you're
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:15:00.680]   just going to have to -- you can't live off the income from your bonds anymore. It doesn't
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:03.680]   really work like that in this environment. Maybe they go a little higher and you can,
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:07.920]   but in 1989, you could put your entire portfolio into government bonds and earn 8 or 9% and
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:11.240]   have been fine. So, if you want anything approaching those levels of returns today, you just have
[00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:14.480]   to live to accept some more volatility, basically.
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:17.480]   >>So, you're saying those were the days, basically.
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:23.120]   >>Yes. How easy was it to invest in the 1980s? The stock market was up like 20% a year. Bonds
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:27.680]   were yielding 7 to 8%. Easiest time in history. If you want to know why a lot of the most
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:30.880]   famous hedge funds in the world started investing in the 1980s and why they have these great
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:34.280]   track records, they're really smart guys, but they also started investing in one of
[00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:38.120]   the greatest decades ever. Sorry, didn't mean to throw some shade there, but it's true.
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:41.400]   >>I'm sure it's a lot of skill, too. No offense to all of our hedge fund viewers.
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:44.960]   >>All right, let's do another one.
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:49.360]   >>Okay. With the recent downturn in the stock market, I've been doubling my monthly contributions
[00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:54.440]   to my Roth IRA. This means I'll be maxed out by June. I want to keep investing at least
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:16:00.120]   30% of my income into the market, which leaves me with two choices. Contribute more to my
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:06.040]   401(k) or my brokerage account. My work will not match my current 5% contribution until
[00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:10.280]   I've been with the company for a year, which will be in December. They use a target date
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:16.520]   fund with a 0.4% expense ratio. My brokerage account mirrors my Roth, which is invested
[00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:22.480]   in passive ETFs with an expense ratio of 0.04%. Should I increase my biweekly contributions
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:27.720]   to the tax advantage 401(k) even though I will not get my match and it's more expensive,
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:31.200]   or fund my brokerage account, which is taxable but cheaper?
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:37.560]   >>Okay. A good financial planning question here. So, let's bring in Kevin, our financial
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:40.560]   planner here, who's been on this show before. Kevin, how's it going?
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:42.160]   >>Good, guys. How are you?
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:43.160]   >>Hey, Kevin.
[00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:47.300]   >>All right. Here's the thing. Why do companies do this where they don't give you a match
[00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:50.240]   for a year? Is that just companies nickel and diming people? Is there an actual reason
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:52.160]   for this?
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:58.240]   >>So, it's mostly just because they're worried that somebody comes in, they stay for six
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:03.320]   months, they give them the free match, and then they leave. And so, honestly, it's just
[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:07.540]   the corporation kind of just trying to, or a corporation, any business, right, just trying
[00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:12.840]   to keep costs a little lower from an overall compensation standpoint. They want to incentivize
[00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:13.840]   you to stick around.
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:17.320]   >>I would like to see some backfill on that match. So, I guess the question here is, okay,
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:20.200]   I don't get the match. Does it still make sense even though the fees are a little higher
[00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:24.480]   to invest in the 401(k) or just put it all in the brokerage account? I guess a lot of
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:27.120]   this depends on if you really care about that tax break. So, why don't you run through how
[00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:28.120]   to think about this?
[00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:33.800]   >>Yeah. So, the 401(k) versus the brokerage, that's exactly what it is. It's a tax play.
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:38.040]   So, in the 401(k), even though you're not getting the match right now and your expense
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:45.600]   ratio is higher, this is just a bet that your taxes today are higher than they will be in
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:51.320]   retirement, right? That's the cleanest way to think about it. And so, if right now you're
[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:57.240]   in the, let's just use simple made up numbers, you're paying 30% income tax now because you're
[00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:01.120]   earning an income, you're earning a salary. In retirement, maybe you're living off of
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:06.120]   just Social Security and some withdrawals from your brokerage account and your tax rate's
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:12.240]   15%. Well, it makes a lot of sense to defer that income until later. That's really kind
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:15.960]   of the tax strategy. Of course, the big variable there is we have no clue what the tax code
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:22.120]   is going to be when you retire, whether that's 5 years from now or 35 years from now. So,
[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:23.920]   that's kind of the tax side of things.
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:28.920]   I also think the behavioral side of things here is setting up your 401(k) just to have
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:32.160]   it come right out of there. It comes out of your paycheck. You never see it hit your account.
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:35.660]   I think it's just easier from a psychological perspective. And maybe if you put into a brokerage
[00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:39.200]   account, you might be more tempted to use that money now. I know you can still take
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.600]   it out of your 401(k), but you have to pay some penalties and jump through some more
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:46.600]   hoops to do it. So, I think from a behavioral perspective, putting it in the 401(k) actually
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:50.000]   makes sense. And then you're already set up with it. And so, when that match does kick
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.760]   in, then it's already there. You don't have to do anything else, right? It's easy. I
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:56.440]   think that's the biggest benefit of the 401(k) is just that it's easy.
[00:18:56.440 --> 00:19:01.800]   Yeah. The automated savings piece is absolutely huge because we've talked about this on the
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:08.180]   show and pretty much every show that we have, is that so much of this is just making mistakes
[00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:12.840]   from a psychological perspective, not setting yourself up for success with investing. And
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:18.320]   that automated every two weeks it's going in is so important. If you can do that in
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:22.620]   the brokerage though, in this particular situation, and you want to wait until you really can
[00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:28.040]   get that full match, we're talking what, six months from now? So, it's not six, seven months
[00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:32.480]   from now. It's not that big of a deal if you take the next six, seven months, front load
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:37.640]   the money into the brokerage, if you can be programmatic and responsible with it. And
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:43.920]   then once the match is fully there, great, you can start putting some money away. That
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:47.460]   I think is the best thing to do. Also, maybe check with your HR department because you're
[00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:53.160]   getting absolutely robbed on fees if you're paying 40 basis points for basically a target
[00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:54.160]   date fund.
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:57.760]   Yeah. And unfortunately, a lot of the HR departments, they don't really know what they're doing
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:01.280]   in a lot of these instances because they don't have the investment acumen or experience to
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:04.960]   do this. And they go with someone they heard of, their brother-in-law, whoever does a 401(k)
[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:09.120]   plan. So, all right, let's do another one, Duncan.
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:15.940]   Okay. So, last but not least, my wife and I have about $170,000 in our brokerage account
[00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:20.580]   that we intend to use for a house down payment. We contribute to retirement accounts and save
[00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:27.140]   quite a lot of money. I work in real estate, and given current house prices, we are biding
[00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:32.220]   our time until there's a correction. In the meantime, and for future finances, we want
[00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:37.180]   to invest the money for the long term. I recently learned about securities-backed lines of credit,
[00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:41.660]   SBLOCs, and they seem like an attractive option. I understand their risks, but I would like
[00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:45.940]   to hear your thoughts. Additionally, with this growing sum of money, what would be the
[00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:50.700]   best option for investment? Wump sum seems dangerous in this environment and for our
[00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:56.540]   purposes. So, maybe some sort of DCA, dollar-cost averaging, perhaps a wump sum of $50,000 and
[00:20:56.540 --> 00:21:01.460]   then a weekly contribution. So, this is a question, as people, our regular viewers are
[00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:06.020]   saying, this is a question we get a lot, but it's important, but this idea of wump sum
[00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:08.820]   versus DCA and different time horizons.
[00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:13.140]   I do want to say, I understand the desire to be patient. No one wants to buy a house
[00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:17.300]   right now because house prices are up and mortgage rates are up, but it's not a foregone
[00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:20.540]   conclusion housing prices are necessarily going to fall. The gains could slow and they
[00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:23.860]   could certainly fall at some point with higher rates, but it doesn't mean they have to. So,
[00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:28.700]   I just want to point that out. Interest rates are rising everywhere else, Kevin, so are
[00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:32.060]   these SBLOC rates rising? How long does it take for those to start rising? I've seen
[00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:35.380]   them, in places like Robin Hood, I get emails saying they've raised rates from, I think,
[00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:39.860]   2% to 3.5% this week. So, are we seeing this in a lot of the bigger brokerages as well?
[00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:43.980]   Yeah, typically, and we talked about this on my last appearance, actually, so I guess
[00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:54.580]   I'm the SBLOC guy now. But right now, most SBLOCs are based off of what used to be LIBOR.
[00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:59.660]   It's now SOFR, Secured Overnight Funding Rate, I think, which is basically just, it's a rate
[00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:03.860]   that is used by the Treasury to figure out how much it would cost to borrow Treasuries
[00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:11.140]   on an overnight basis. So, that's not, I actually had a client ask me this yesterday, "Hey,
[00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:15.140]   just saw rates going up 50 basis points. Is my loan going to go up 50 basis points?" It's
[00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:19.980]   not tied directly, but just given that rates generally are rising, you're going to see
[00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:25.780]   a raise in that rate as well. I think probably three months ago, these things are quoted
[00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:34.180]   on a spread versus that SOFR rate. So, three months ago, if the reference rate was 10 basis
[00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:39.540]   points, it might be something like 60 today. And again, that's not necessarily just because
[00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:42.780]   Jay Powell said, "We're going up 50 bps." It's just what the market is determining.
[00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:47.780]   Got to remember, though, he said we're not going to raise it by 75 bps next time. So,
[00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:48.780]   that's good news.
[00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:50.740]   Right. Maybe he needs to come out today and remind everybody.
[00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:55.020]   The stock market failed to get that message today. I will say, in terms of what to invest
[00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:59.060]   in, a lot of this depends on, are you still going to use this for a down payment? So,
[00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:01.660]   let's say you just extend it and you say, "Okay, we're not going to buy a house today,
[00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:04.380]   but maybe in three years or five years." So, I think you have to tie that time horizon
[00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:08.160]   to this to figure out what you want to put it into. And that means something that's probably
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:12.340]   relatively safe, even three to five years. As we've seen this year, we're four months
[00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:16.300]   into the year and the stock market's down, I don't know, 14 or 15 percent. Some other
[00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:20.820]   stock market's down much more. So, if you want to take that risk of, let's say you had
[00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:24.540]   to do your down payment now and you had a lot of that money in stocks, if you have 15
[00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:27.100]   percent lower down payment because all your money's in stocks, I still think you have
[00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:31.260]   to think of something that's a little safer and more defensive here for this kind of thing.
[00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:34.340]   I don't like the idea of taking a lot of risk of this. You could put it into more, we talked
[00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:39.820]   in the past about maybe more diversified portfolio, something that's like 50/50 or 40/60 or something.
[00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:43.940]   But I think in terms of the lump sum, the first question is, what is your allocation
[00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:47.340]   going to be and how defensive do you want to go with this money?
[00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:54.580]   Yeah, I think, you know, you're actually maybe even a little better place now with rates
[00:23:54.580 --> 00:24:00.340]   rising because you can go buy a shorter term Treasury ETF and actually get some yield for
[00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:06.380]   it. If that down payment is going to happen in the next 18 months to three years, that
[00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:13.740]   might not be a bad place for it. And for the longer term stuff, you know, we're not trying
[00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:20.780]   to time the market right. If this really is long term money and we're talking 30, 40 years,
[00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:25.980]   lump summing it today versus dollar cost averaging it over the next six months, it's probably
[00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:31.940]   not going to make a huge difference. But psychologically, if the dollar cost averaging feels better to
[00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:35.940]   you, sort of similar to the last question, just be programmatic about it and say, OK,
[00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:41.580]   I'm going to put X in today and once a month it's going to move in another 5 or 10 percent
[00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:45.380]   or whatever it is. And don't try to get cute with, oh, it's down big. Let me accelerate.
[00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:51.660]   Just do your thing. That'll make it less of an emotional decision for you. So that's kind
[00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:55.460]   of how I would think about it. I know, obviously, our colleague, Nick Maggioli, you guys mentioned
[00:24:55.460 --> 00:25:02.460]   him earlier, has written a lot on the merits of lump summing versus dollar cost averaging.
[00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:05.420]   That's something good to check out of dollars and data, his blog or his book.
[00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:10.420]   Duncan, I think we need SHY to sponsor this show because we've mentioned it every week
[00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:13.980]   for three. But you're right, Kevin, you get almost three percent in a short term Treasury
[00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:17.540]   and that still has a little bit of interest rate risk with rates rise. But those are so
[00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:21.260]   short term and the rates have already risen so much that that is a really good option
[00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:24.860]   for people saving for a down payment right now that want to earn a little bit of money.
[00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:29.500]   And they really couldn't have it in the past. I think it got down to, I don't know, 25 basis
[00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:34.020]   points or something ridiculous in the pandemic. And it's been it's finally risen for the past
[00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:37.660]   six or nine months. So you finally have some yield you can earn.
[00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:42.220]   And for people with a few years of a horizon, I mean, our old friends, I bonds come back
[00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:48.180]   in the picture, right? I mean, yes, I know it's capped, but yeah, 10,000. That's come
[00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:52.340]   on. Where's the White House with this? Increase the cap on I bonds. What are you waiting for?
[00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:58.340]   Right? You should start a campaign. Twenty five grand, make it twenty five. And people,
[00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:01.140]   the people, the people, the viewers love the I bonds, don't they don't? I guess they're
[00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:05.940]   afraid that someone's going to start a hedge fund of I bonds that maybe it's got to be
[00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:09.460]   the best for my two best performers this year, I bonds in my house.
[00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:13.180]   So those are the only things that I have that are positive this year, I think maybe some
[00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:16.900]   values that we should have something. All right. Thanks again to Kevin Young for coming
[00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:23.220]   back on. We always love Kevin's advice. He's an advisor for us at Riddles. Keep those questions
[00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:27.260]   and comments coming. Remember, I don't shop for all of your needs, shopping needs. I was
[00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:30.620]   in New York a couple weeks ago and they had a portfolio rescue towel. We have it in blue
[00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:36.820]   and red. Right, Duncan? They were sweet. I love them. They're cool. Yeah. Josh said it's
[00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:41.300]   more of a pool towel. It's not quite as thick as a beach towel. So just FYI, if you know
[00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:45.420]   your towels, it's a little on the thinner side, I guess. But yeah, I like them. I think
[00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:49.500]   they're good. It's fine. If you have a question, ask the compound show at Gmail dot com and
[00:26:49.500 --> 00:27:07.700]   we will see you next time. See you, everyone.
