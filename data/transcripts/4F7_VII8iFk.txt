[00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:11.280]   Hello everyone and welcome to the Grace Point official, just the official unofficial Grace
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.560]   Point podcast. Bonus episode. Here we go. Yeah, so we're gonna do something a little different
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.760]   today. Wanted to sort of take a break from I don't know, talking about just different issues and
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.880]   things. And how are we describing this, Steven, we're calling, you know, how like MBR has a tiny
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.360]   desk concert. Maybe we'll call it the Lifetime Table Concert because we're sitting at a Lifetime
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:37.120]   Table Concert. But yeah, we just wanted to, you know, both of us, we led praise. My career was
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:43.600]   very short. But yeah, and we like singing, we like worship. And I figured it would be good to
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.800]   kind of end this season by just taking it back to basics. And by basics, I mean, just take it back to
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.360]   back to God, back to the gospel. Yeah, we've been talking about like church,
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.040]   we're gonna talk about our experiences, things like that, which has been good and has its place. But
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.440]   just felt like, man, we gotta, let's just bring it back to God. Let's, let's sing to God. Let's praise
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.600]   Him. It's all about Him, right? Anyway, so we're gonna share a couple Bible verses and just play a
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.400]   couple songs. Yeah, so we each picked one verse and one song that we wanted to share. So you want to
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.480]   start us off, Stephen? Yeah, so I picked 1 Peter 5:6-7. "Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.760]   hand of God, so that at the proper time He may exalt you, casting all your anxieties on Him because He
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:31.280]   cares for you." I chose this, I mean, recently I've been reading Humility by Andrew Murray, and that book
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:38.640]   always gets me, reminds me how proud I am, reminds me how arrogant I am, just thinking that I don't need
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.160]   God, thinking that my significance lies in what I do and how I perform and things like that. And just
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.880]   thinking like, anything that humbles me, anything that reminds me that that's not it, that my fundamental
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.480]   posture to God is that I need Him, that my fundamental posture towards God is that I'm just made in His
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:01.200]   image, I'm just literally, I'm a reflection of Him, and that it's not about my performance, it's not about
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.600]   my significance found in what I produce, but it's just, I am a vessel, I am an instrument of God, right?
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:14.800]   And just sort of aligning myself back to that reality, that that is the relationship between
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:21.440]   me and God. I'm just the creature, He's God, right? He's the Creator, and that gives me a lot of peace.
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.160]   That is what puts me in the place where I can cast all my anxieties on Him. There's a lot of stress,
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.880]   a lot of worries in life, especially when you're church planting and stuff like that, but
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.880]   that's when I really realign back to that reality. I'm just the creature, and He's the Creator.
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.480]   Yeah, that's when I remember that God cares for me, and I can cast all my anxieties on Him. And so
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:47.760]   that's why I chose the song that I chose, Same God by Elevation Worship. Yeah, it's just, God, I need you,
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:56.960]   you know, so. All right. How about you? I picked, well, my verse was Revelations 21:1-5, kind of a big
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.040]   chunk, but let me read this for us. It says, "Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.720]   heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more. And I saw the holy city,
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.680]   New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.240]   heard a loud voice from the throne saying, Behold, a dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.000]   with them, and they will be His people, and God Himself will be with them as their God. He will
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.720]   wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, and neither shall there be mourning,
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.680]   nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away. And He who was seated on the throne
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:34.880]   said, Behold, I am making all things new." And I picked that verse because, yeah, it's just, it's easy to get
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:41.040]   caught up in what's going on in this world and in our lives and to feel like that is the end-all be-all,
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.760]   you know? And I love this passage because it reminds me, no, there's a greater reality. And,
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:52.240]   you know, I mean, I think one of the toughest things in life is, uh, relationships, you know,
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:04:00.320]   and the people who, um, you know, frankly, that are for whatever reason, um, not on good terms with
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.200]   anymore, you know, whether that be, yeah, people who are not at our church anymore because they left
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:11.520]   on, you know, they left with hurt and anger, you know, or whether that be, you know, I think back to
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.400]   the old BBC days and my friends who were on the other side of that split. And just to remember,
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.080]   like, I think it gives me perspective to remember, you know, one day we're all going to be in heaven,
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.120]   and we're all going to be friends, and we're all going to be around the throne of God,
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.640]   worshiping God together. And that gives me a lot of hope, and it helps keep things in perspective,
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.240]   right? Let's, uh, let's love each other here. So it's not awkward later. Okay.
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:38.560]   That would be my word. Um, so, uh, my, the song I picked is what a day it'll be.
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.080]   Uh, it's a kind of a little known song. It's by a guy named Greg Ferguson.
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:48.720]   Uh, but it's a song about heaven. And, um, yeah, so we're just gonna, we're gonna give this a shot.
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.720]   Um, yeah, we're just gonna sing. Just gonna sing.
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:56.400]   And, uh, join us if you would like. And, uh, yeah, let's do it.
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:16.240]   I'm calling on the God of Jacob
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:24.000]   God, whose love endures through generations.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.480]   I know that you will keep your covenant.
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:42.960]   I'm calling on the God of Moses, the one who opened up the ocean.
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:52.240]   I need you now to do the same thing for me.
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:59.440]   Oh God, oh God, I need you. Oh God, my God, I need you now.

[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:56.800]   I'm calling on the God of David, who made a shepherd boy courageous.
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:04.800]   I may not face Goliath, but I've got my own giants.
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:12.560]   Oh God, oh God, I need you. Oh God, my God, I need you now.

[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:27.360]   Just watch the Father laugh and smile, lifting up His joyful child.
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:41.360]   And hear the hosts of heaven singing a sweet and soulful angel choir singing hallelujah.
