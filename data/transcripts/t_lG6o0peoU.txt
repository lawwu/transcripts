[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920]   - I mean, are there things that people should eat
[00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.280]   and not eat, things that people should supplement
[00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:11.280]   and not supplement in order to optimize their fertility?
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.080]   - I mean, this is definitely an interest of mine, right?
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.800]   All my fellowship research cycles around fecundability
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.200]   and natural fertility.
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.140]   And I think we really do a disservice
[00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.400]   by how medicine really is categorized by organ systems
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.800]   because we act like things in one place
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.100]   don't impact the other.
[00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:27.940]   - As if.
[00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.560]   - Right, but it's, you have a body
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.260]   and your body and especially your hormones change
[00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.100]   and fluctuate and they're meant to.
[00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.880]   They are meant to be a dynamic system,
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.180]   but the world and the environment
[00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.960]   of which you are subjecting your body to
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.020]   has proven changes on both hormonal function
[00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.140]   and also when it comes to egg and sperm quality.
[00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.760]   And so if you are somebody who just wants
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.260]   to live your healthiest life
[00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260]   and have your most regular periods
[00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.800]   and have your hormones as well balanced
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.300]   as they can be for a lack of a better word,
[00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.180]   we'll just say that that means
[00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.920]   that they're functioning normally,
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.340]   then paying attention to the things
[00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.820]   that you do are really important.
[00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.820]   And so I know this is a big one for you.
[00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.240]   Sleep is probably the number one thing
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.940]   that people don't do that does impact
[00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.540]   their reproductive hormone system
[00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.500]   and therefore can impact egg and sperm quality
[00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.740]   because sleep is when you have cellular repair
[00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.100]   and when you can drop your inflammation levels.
[00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.100]   We know that inflammation is just toxic to eggs and sperm.
[00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.060]   It is.
[00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.760]   The inflammatory environment is not ideal for conception.
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.680]   And then for a female,
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.840]   you have to deal with the fact
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.560]   that you have your egg quality,
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.160]   but you also have how inflammation
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.060]   or what you're exposed to impacts your uterine environment.
[00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.760]   So you have a two-fold situation here.
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.480]   So none of this should be shocking news
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.160]   when it comes to nutrition,
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.780]   but it is not talked about enough.
[00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.100]   You're right.
[00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.040]   Decreasing inflammation by the foods
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.300]   that we put in our body is consistently shown
[00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.160]   with an improvement in fecundability,
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.160]   an improvement in ovulation,
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.640]   and an improvement in success with IVF,
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.160]   and a decrease in miscarriage, right?
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.520]   Huge studies have looked at these.
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.000]   Now, the big caveat is that nutrition studies are super hard
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.160]   because people who consume flax, for example,
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.000]   tend to have other good health behaviors
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.440]   that sometimes make it hard to identify what flax did
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.960]   versus their general health
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.960]   versus somebody who eats fast food every day.
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.320]   So nutrition studies tend to be observational,
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.460]   and fertility studies are really hard too
[00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.680]   because what endpoint are you using?
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.600]   Is it getting pregnant?
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.660]   Is it live birth?
[00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:41.960]   Are you looking at IVF?
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.640]   Are you looking at natural fertility?
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.000]   And we have a lot of different overlap
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.680]   that makes both of these a little bit difficult.
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.280]   And so they're all cohort-based or population-based studies
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.920]   where you analyze how people perform
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.520]   when it comes to fertility treatments
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.360]   or getting pregnant naturally
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.040]   based on their exposures to certain things.
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.480]   Diets high in fruits and vegetables are good for you,
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.160]   right, fiber, antioxidants.
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.280]   Fruit is not bad.
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.240]   Fruit got this really bad reputation.
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.080]   - Really? I love fruit.
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.900]   - I love fruit too,
[00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.200]   but people think that it has sugar
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.480]   and that it's bad for you.
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.920]   - Well, it has fructose, but, you know.
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:15.760]   - No, it's not.
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.400]   That type of sugar is not bad for you,
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.240]   if we can just agree on the fact
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.600]   that fruit has a lot of nutritional benefit,
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.160]   especially when it comes to vitamins and antioxidants
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.320]   that can be extremely beneficial in decreasing inflammation.
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.880]   Grains, so whole grains,
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.240]   especially that your body, you know,
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.600]   provide a lot of great fiber.
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.000]   So, of course, if you have celiac
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.720]   or you're gluten intolerant, you're a different category.
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.600]   But there was so much focus on keto
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.000]   and people eliminating grains as a food group overall.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.560]   And even though that might be utilized
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.000]   in a dietary strategy to lose weight
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.940]   and losing weight can improve fertility,
[00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.620]   likely because of inflammation being the primary driver.
[00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.660]   Because we know that even in studies
[00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.520]   where I take donor eggs
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.700]   and I transfer that embryo into somebody who's overweight,
[00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.240]   they have lower odds of success
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.840]   than if they were a normal BMI.
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.880]   So we can't act like that causation
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.040]   is just on egg quality from obesity, right?
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.800]   There's also some inflammation,
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.640]   some inflammatory changes
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.640]   that impact the body's ability or desire
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.760]   to allow an embryo to implant.
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.520]   So fruits, veggies, whole grains are all good.
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.640]   Interestingly, you know, dairy.
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.160]   Dairy tends to be okay in most studies,
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.680]   but what we do see is that if you're gonna have dairy,
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.480]   have the real thing, the processed dairy, the skim milk,
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.200]   that actually decreases your fertility.
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.560]   And likely because the processing
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.560]   to make it still look like milk when you take out the fat
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.200]   is adding in things that are unnatural,
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.160]   potentially impacting your fertility.
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.200]   - I don't drink milk anymore,
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.360]   but when I was a teenager, I drank half and half.
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.640]   I'm not recommending anyone do that.
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.040]   Remember, I was a skiing teenager.
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.160]   - You were trying to bulk up.
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.360]   - Well, no, I just could afford to.
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.800]   I wasn't trying, at that age, I wasn't trying to at all,
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.600]   but it was just delicious.
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.840]   But so cheeses,
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.960]   whole, full fat milk.
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.840]   - Yogurt, yeah. - Half and half yogurt, okay.
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.320]   Yeah, but don't choose the skim one.
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.400]   Choose the actual one that comes with some of the milk fat.
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.560]   Fat is not bad for you.
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.400]   There's also this, right,
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.360]   hopefully we're getting away from it,
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.120]   but there's been such a low-fat craze
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.240]   or this real attention that fat is so bad,
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.160]   but fat comes in so many important forms.
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:37.000]   Avocados and oils and nuts, dairy, meat.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.360]   Fat and cholesterol are the backbone for all hormones,
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.800]   right, so you need that in order for your body
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.680]   to make the estrogen and progesterone
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.040]   that it needs to allow this whole process to happen.
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.000]   And so there's this idea that those are bad for you.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.840]   That's just really not.
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.640]   So healthy fats, whole grains, fruits, veggies.
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:56.800]   - And what about proteins and meats?
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.680]   Because I think within those categories,
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.680]   I'm a big fan of sustainably raised meats, if possible.
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.320]   Some people choose not to eat meat, but fish, eggs.
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.080]   - Love it all.
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.600]   Okay, so let's just go through the meats
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.440]   and the myth and the fact.
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.320]   So we'll do tofu.
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.640]   So there's this big issue that tofu has soy
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.600]   and that too much soy can be bad
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.920]   because soy can be a phytoestrogen.
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:23.240]   Tofu does not negatively impact fertility, even in men.
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.640]   In fact, it can improve it
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.360]   because it does have some antioxidant-like properties,
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.480]   lots of iron.
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:32.520]   When it comes to fish, fish are fantastic sources
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.040]   of healthy fats and omega-3 fatty acids,
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:39.040]   which are very crucial in the reproductive process.
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.080]   We do worry about, if you're pregnant,
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.160]   having too much fish and overexposure to mercury
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.780]   and how that can impact fetal brain development.
[00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:50.320]   So the general recommendation is three servings per week.
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.160]   That doesn't--
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:52.760]   - Let me guess, a serving is like four to six ounces,
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.000]   as opposed to like a real human that eats, you know.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:55.840]   - A real human.
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.520]   - Yeah, that eats, you know, six to eight ounces of fish.
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.160]   - And I think it's important to say,
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.760]   even though people will tell you that
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.140]   when you're trying to get pregnant
[00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:06.360]   with the idea of we don't know
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.520]   when you're going to be pregnant,
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.160]   if you're going through things like egg freezing or IVF
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.400]   and you know when you're going to be pregnant,
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.520]   I wouldn't feel like you have to restrict yourself
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:19.160]   on the consumption of seafood during those time periods
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.480]   when you know you're not pregnant yet,
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:23.240]   because really the concern is about that mercury
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.520]   and what it could potentially do to a fetal brain.
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:26.700]   - And raw seafood, correct?
[00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:28.040]   No sushi, no sashimi.
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.160]   - Well, when you're pregnant, correct.
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.080]   And that's mostly because of the risk of infectious disease
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:35.200]   that can cause severe brain development and other issues.
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.520]   - What do they do in Japan?
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:37.960]   - I don't know, I don't live there.
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:38.960]   - They probably laugh at this.
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.360]   - They probably do laugh at us.
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.400]   They probably do laugh at us a lot.
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:45.080]   - Someone who's been pregnant in Japan.
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:45.920]   - Yeah, reach out, tell us.
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.480]   - Yeah, or conceived in Japan.
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.680]   Tell us, don't tell us the story of the conception,
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.260]   but tell us, did you have sashimi?
[00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:57.380]   - Overall, meat is a really broad category
[00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:58.980]   and studies study it differently.
[00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:00.060]   Like, is it all meat?
[00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:04.200]   Are you distinguishing now red meat and chicken?
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.400]   Are you putting it all together?
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.800]   I mean, obviously I think we can all come
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.240]   to the agreement that processed meats are not good
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.520]   for a variety of different reasons.
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.520]   In addition to being carcinogenic,
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:17.840]   those toxins do negatively impact fertility.
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:18.680]   Now--
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:19.880]   - So deli meat, no bueno.
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:23.040]   - So yeah, but in specifically those things like the bacon
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:26.440]   and like the things that are really highly processed,
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:29.880]   hot dogs, sorry, the 4th of July hot dog picnic.
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:32.560]   But those things really do not provide
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:36.040]   nutritional advantages and only harm.
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:38.200]   Especially then when we have red meat.
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.880]   For the most part, red meat when isolated individually
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:46.640]   in most circumstances in moderation tends to be fine.
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.600]   I usually tell my patients,
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.320]   I want them to eat a plant forward diet.
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.540]   But that doesn't mean no meat.
[00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:54.840]   But I say, look at your meat servings,
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.320]   I don't want it red meat every single day.
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.640]   Because there was a study looking at IVF
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.620]   and looking at embryos and the more servings,
[00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:05.140]   a lot of nutritional studies based things on quartile.
[00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:07.560]   So who eats the lowest and the second most
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.540]   and the third most and the top most.
[00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:13.120]   And people who ate in that top quartile of red meat
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.100]   had lower progression of embryos through the culture.
[00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:19.240]   So less embryos that developed,
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:22.880]   less normal embryos and lower success rates.
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.960]   - Do we know anything about how that meat was arriving?
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:26.800]   - No, unfortunately we don't.
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.640]   - Are we talking about like hoagie sandwiches?
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:29.460]   - We don't know it.
[00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:30.360]   - Or are we talking about like grass fed steaks?
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:32.480]   - Right, these studies are not wonderful,
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:34.720]   but that doesn't mean that they don't hold merit
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.480]   in helping us guide counseling.
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.960]   But no, that one was how many servings of red meat
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.360]   do you eat in a week, right?
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:42.840]   So we don't really know.
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:46.520]   Does the really ethically sourced, the grass fed,
[00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:50.800]   this environment which we feel like is much less toxic
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.080]   than potentially, let's say like a cattle factory
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.200]   where the cows are injected with all sorts of things.
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.600]   Is there a difference
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.180]   in how those impact your reproduction?
[00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:00.080]   Probably, right?
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.080]   If this cow is getting injected with a lot of hormones,
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.580]   why are we thinking that it's not impacting
[00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:07.480]   the meat that you're then ingesting into your body?
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:08.640]   - No, I think our audience
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:12.560]   will certainly subscribe to that idea.
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:13.560]   I think most of them will.
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.200]   I mean, the notion that like the pollutants
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.920]   you breathe in the air somehow are not the air
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.000]   that you breathe into your lungs
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.680]   is just like completely naive.
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:22.520]   - Wild.
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:23.340]   - And the idea--
[00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:24.180]   - But people feel that way
[00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:25.800]   and they hold strongly to this idea
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:29.080]   that it can't be this thing that I love
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:31.720]   that is causing this problem, right?
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:35.200]   The denial of the association between
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.640]   what we put in and on our body
[00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:40.280]   and how it impacts our body's function
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:41.920]   is really strong in some people.
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:46.720]   And I think it's really just lack of education and awareness
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:49.520]   because the medical community for so long
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.720]   did not address these factors, right?
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.760]   Your doctor never talks to you about nutrition.
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:58.840]   And so it just became this idea that it must not matter,
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:01.700]   otherwise your doctor would talk to you about it.
[00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.480]   I think sugar is the last thing I just didn't mention,
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:08.480]   but added sugar and artificial sugars are bad for you.
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:09.800]   - Artificial sugars.
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:10.920]   - Artificial sugars too.
[00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:14.960]   - Including stevia, so plant-based low-calorie sweeteners.
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.440]   - Stevia itself hasn't been studied
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:17.800]   as much as the other ones,
[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:21.540]   things like sweet and low and all of those.
[00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:24.280]   But what we do know is that they interfere,
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.040]   they cause inflammation inside the body.
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:29.400]   And then they also can cause a stress reaction
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:33.440]   and they can cause higher rates of miscarriage
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:36.480]   when you intake more sugar and artificial sugar.
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.440]   So that's a lot to wrap your head around.
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.540]   And I say the same thing to every patient.
[00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:45.280]   One cake, one this, one hot dog.
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:46.600]   I mean, those things individually
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.160]   are not gonna make a difference, right?
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.280]   It's the choices that you make every single day
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:54.240]   that are going to set you up to be your healthy self or not.
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:56.400]   And so you should make choices
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:58.400]   in line with how you wanna treat yourself.
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.500]   You want to be in your best health.
[00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:02.520]   You want your hormones functioning the best.
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:06.680]   And if that added helps you get pregnant when you want to,
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:09.260]   helps you have a better chance of success with IVF,
[00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.240]   oh my gosh, what a fantastic benefit.
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.800]   But that doesn't mean you can't enjoy
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:17.320]   some of these bad things here and there,
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:20.240]   as long as you've set yourself up on the day-to-day
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:23.340]   where you're giving your body lots of nutritious food
[00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:25.840]   that it needs to make hormones.
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:29.540]   Similarly, being very underweight and calorie restricting,
[00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:32.440]   we all know is really terrible for your reproductive system
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:35.240]   and can cause the brain to totally shut down ovulation
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:39.360]   because it senses that you can't have a pregnancy.
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:40.960]   - If people miscarry, excuse me,
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:43.600]   by virtue of being underweight,
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:48.440]   does the body, like I learned some years ago,
[00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:49.480]   I think this is still true,
[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:52.280]   that one of the signals for the onset of puberty in females
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:56.720]   is that leptin hormone is secreted from body fat
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:59.520]   that then signals to the brain, to the hypothalamus,
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:03.640]   like, okay, there's enough reserves to create environment.
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:05.800]   It's a signal about environmental--
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.320]   - Yeah, there's enough extra fat to have a baby.
[00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:09.220]   - Yeah, and there's presumably enough food around
[00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:11.300]   to sustain that baby, right.
[00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:15.960]   Are miscarriages and lack of body fat correlated?
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:17.840]   - On both ends of the spectrum, yes.
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:21.040]   So lack of body fat and being overweight,
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:25.000]   we see decrease in getting pregnant per month
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.080]   and we see increase in losing pregnancies.
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:31.360]   So certainly, there is a healthy medium
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:33.680]   where your body has what it needs.
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:36.260]   And that makes sense because if you have,
[00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.520]   I like to even say hypothalamic dysfunction.
[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.680]   So maybe your brain's not totally shut off
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:42.040]   where it's sending out no hormones
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:43.680]   and you're not ovulating
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:45.860]   'cause you're not getting pregnant in that circumstance.
[00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:48.660]   But certainly, ovulation disorders are on a spectrum
[00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:51.360]   where you go from a perfectly synchronized cycle
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:54.140]   to one that prolongs it, gets shorter together,
[00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:56.180]   then prolongs, and then you have nothing.
[00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:58.060]   There's this spectrum of dysfunction
[00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:00.160]   which is representing your hormones
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:03.220]   not being necessarily perfect.
[00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:05.360]   And that can have impacts on the placenta
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:07.940]   trying to grow into that uterus.
[00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:10.020]   I mean, the placenta is fascinating, right?
[00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:11.940]   An entire talk just on the placenta.
[00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:13.980]   But it does this incredible job
[00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:15.700]   where your body has to not reject it,
[00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:18.460]   yet allow it to eat away at the side of your uterus
[00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:20.580]   and grow into your blood vessels.
[00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:23.340]   But that requires a very specific hormonal environment
[00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:26.220]   for it to be done and to be done right.
[00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:27.660]   I think in the same breath of all this,
[00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:29.820]   what you're also asking is,
[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:31.140]   yeah, okay, so that's eating healthy.
[00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:33.100]   None of that's really new news for most people.
[00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:34.660]   A lot of those things I just said.
[00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:36.380]   - Well, I think some, but I do wanna thank you
[00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:38.320]   'cause I think rarely, if ever,
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.980]   do we hear somebody, a physician,
[00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:42.900]   be really direct about like, hey, listen,
[00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:45.580]   some red meat, yes, not excessive amounts of red meat.
[00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:49.460]   Ideally from sustainable sources,
[00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:52.260]   whole fat milk products, grains, fruits, vegetables.
[00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:53.940]   I mean, those kind of straight,
[00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:55.900]   what to you seem like straightforward directives
[00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:58.340]   are actually pretty rare in the landscape
[00:14:58.340 --> 00:14:59.820]   of public health discussion.
[00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:01.740]   Because more often than not,
[00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:02.840]   people talk about nutrition
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:04.820]   in these kind of elimination diet type things.
[00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:07.700]   Like eliminate all the grains or eliminate all the meat
[00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:10.920]   or eliminate all the milk fats.
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:12.660]   When in reality, I think people forget
[00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:15.540]   that like most people out there are omnivores
[00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:18.180]   and they can make better choices about not deli meat.
[00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:20.060]   You know, less bacon, if any bacon, right?
[00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:21.620]   - Have some veggies with your lunch, right?
[00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:23.660]   Like you can make better choices on the day to day.
[00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:25.700]   I think that is a great point.
[00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:27.340]   I think there's a place for supplements.
[00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:28.500]   I think the big disclaimer
[00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:30.040]   that everybody's gonna say with supplements
[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:32.780]   is that they are not regulated
[00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:35.580]   like the way medications are, right?
[00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:39.980]   And I will say supplements and herbs are different things.
[00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:42.140]   Right, a supplement,
[00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:44.740]   but many companies are adding herbs to their supplements
[00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:47.580]   and that can get into really murky territory,
[00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:50.140]   especially when it comes to how some of these herbs
[00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:52.620]   do have estrogen and progestin like properties
[00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:55.300]   and can impact reproduction and hormones.
[00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:56.980]   - And perhaps even androgenic properties too.
[00:15:56.980 --> 00:16:00.860]   - Yes, so we can't act like everything's created equal.
[00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:01.960]   So I always tell people,
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:05.180]   if I recommend you take a supplement or your doctor does,
[00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:08.260]   your due diligence is to look at what is also included
[00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:11.860]   and make sure it doesn't have these extra added things
[00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:13.100]   that they're unaware of,
[00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:16.140]   because sometimes they can have negative impact
[00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:17.660]   at one stage of your life or another,
[00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:19.460]   depending on where you are.
[00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:22.380]   Certainly, a prenatal vitamin, which has folic acid,
[00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:25.420]   we all know that folic acid is really important
[00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:26.780]   to prevent neural tube defects,
[00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:28.740]   but it's also important in cell division
[00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:32.620]   and how the ovary is growing follicles and growing eggs.
[00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:36.060]   - So should people, women, but also men,
[00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:38.380]   be taking a vitamin with folic acid
[00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:41.020]   even when they're not trying to conceive?
[00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:43.380]   - There's no harm in having it,
[00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:46.220]   but very often pregnancies occur
[00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:48.160]   when you're not trying to conceive,
[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.820]   and that is a store that needs to be built up
[00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:51.980]   three months ahead of time.
[00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:54.940]   So we really need you to be taking that
[00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:56.440]   ahead of getting pregnant.
[00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:58.780]   So not just, let's get pregnant right now,
[00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:01.080]   I'm going to start this prenatal vitamin.
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:04.180]   So I recommend anybody who's in their reproductive years,
[00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:05.860]   take a prenatal vitamin.
[00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:09.820]   We also know that many, many people are vitamin D deficient
[00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:13.660]   and vitamin D does impact reproduction.
[00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:17.820]   And so I usually say 1,000 international units of vitamin D
[00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:19.780]   is not going to be harmful in anybody.
[00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:21.980]   It's going to be helpful for most people.
[00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:25.220]   Some people definitely need higher levels.
[00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:27.140]   So we screen everybody with a vitamin D
[00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:29.540]   to see who needs to have extra,
[00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:32.700]   but a blanket statement that extra vitamin D
[00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:34.260]   is going to be helpful.
[00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:37.500]   Omega-3 fatty acids, also extremely important
[00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:39.860]   in one, being anti-inflammatory,
[00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:42.740]   but two, brain development of a fetus.
[00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:45.420]   So most prenatals now actually do have
[00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:47.660]   those omega-3 fatty acids in them,
[00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:50.740]   but if they don't, I recommend a patient take those.
[00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:54.420]   - Just a brief question/insertion there.
[00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:56.580]   There's a laboratory up at the University of California,
[00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:57.540]   Santa Barbara, that's published
[00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:59.540]   some really interesting data showing that
[00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:01.900]   essentially brain weight,
[00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:05.100]   which is just about one indirect measure of brain health,
[00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:09.060]   but brain weight at birth seems to be correlated,
[00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:10.460]   at least in some positive way,
[00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:13.100]   with the amount of essential fatty acids
[00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:15.260]   that mom consumed during pregnancy.
[00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:16.780]   Does that sound, does that hold?
[00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:18.340]   - Yeah, I mean, that does hold.
[00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:23.180]   And there's mice studies about that mice are smarter
[00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:26.540]   when they have diets with omega-3 fatty acids
[00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:28.740]   when they're in utero, right?
[00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:30.980]   So the exposure and the time period is really important.
[00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:32.820]   And omega-3s have a lot of health benefits
[00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:35.100]   when it comes to their antioxidant properties,
[00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:38.380]   especially in endometriosis,
[00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:41.460]   diseases that are very highly inflammatory.
[00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:43.740]   They can be very beneficial.
[00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:45.220]   - We're definitely gonna talk about your work
[00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:48.180]   after baby has arrived and impact of essential fatty acids,
[00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:50.780]   but what would you say is the dosage cutoff?
[00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:53.380]   On this podcast before, I've sort of thrown out numbers,
[00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:56.520]   like one to two grams per day
[00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:59.860]   of the EPA form of essential fatty acids.
[00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:01.060]   And then we could have a whole discussion
[00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:02.660]   about omega-3, omega-6 ratios.
[00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:05.220]   But do you think there's a upper limit?
[00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:09.860]   Is it truly that, let's say up to four grams per day of EPA,
[00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:12.180]   would that be advantageous?
[00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:13.380]   Is it better than one gram?
[00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:14.660]   - I tell people a gram.
[00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:15.500]   - A gram, okay.
[00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:16.620]   That's in alignment with pretty much
[00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:18.460]   what we've talked about before.
[00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:19.540]   - So that's what I recommend.
[00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:21.540]   You know, when I give my handout to my patients
[00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:22.620]   and they're trying to get pregnant,
[00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:25.980]   it's gonna have a prenatal, 1,000 IUs of vitamin D,
[00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:28.740]   a gram of omega-3s, and then CoQ10.
[00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:33.740]   So CoQ10, which essentially, in general,
[00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:35.580]   is trying to help the mitochondria.
[00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:36.860]   That's the whole idea here,
[00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:38.900]   that it is helping provide support
[00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:41.620]   across the body in a lot of different ways, right?
[00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:44.580]   Like CoQ10 is used in a lot of different areas of the body.
[00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:46.220]   But when it comes to reproduction,
[00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:50.140]   when it comes to meiosis and cell division and ovulation
[00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:52.740]   and egg quality and even sperm quality,
[00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:57.740]   there's a place for CoQ10 showing benefit without harm, right?
[00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:00.100]   And so no, like I said earlier,
[00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:01.900]   nothing's without any harm or any risk of harm,
[00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:02.860]   but very, very little.
[00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:05.260]   So I usually recommend if you're trying to get pregnant
[00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:08.940]   and you take CoQ10, a dose of 200 milligrams
[00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:09.940]   three times a day.
[00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:11.220]   So there's kind of a higher dose
[00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:12.900]   than sometimes people are on.
[00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:16.940]   Often prenatals now have just like 200 total in it.
[00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:17.780]   And so-
[00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:19.700]   - The expensive ingredients are usually
[00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:22.860]   the lower concentrations in blends.
[00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:24.620]   - Just enough so they can put it on the label.
[00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:26.860]   - Right, which includes CoQ10.
[00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:28.340]   Does the form of CoQ10 matter?
[00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:29.900]   'Cause you'll find them in gel capsules.
[00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:33.100]   You'll also find them in powdered capsules.
[00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:34.260]   - I always say, I mean,
[00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:36.300]   there might be for the individual person.
[00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:39.180]   I mean, absorption of medication is really depending a lot
[00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:41.300]   on gut health and other factors.
[00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:42.740]   But the number one issue with supplementation
[00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:44.500]   is that people don't stick to it.
[00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:46.020]   So I always say whichever one
[00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:47.540]   you're going to consistently take
[00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:49.180]   is going to be the better form.
[00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:50.020]   - Right.
[00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:52.600]   (upbeat music)
[00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:55.180]   (upbeat music)
[00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:57.340]   (upbeat music)
