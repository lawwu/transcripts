[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600]   Welcome to the Bogleheads chapter series.
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.460]   This episode was hosted by the pre and early retirement life stage chapter and recorded
[00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.000]   November 8th, 2023.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.280]   The session features a Q&A and open discussion with our guest, Sylvia Auten.
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.880]   Bogleheads are investors who follow John Bogle's philosophy for attaining financial independence.
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.100]   This recording is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as personalized
[00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.340]   investment advice.
[00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.000]   Sylvia, thanks so much for being here.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.560]   It gives us a great pleasure to have you be the guest speaker.
[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:40.940]   I'll turn it over to you shortly.
[00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.400]   I'll reiterate what Jim said and I'll elaborate on it a little without stealing your thunder,
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.400]   Sylvia.
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.640]   Just for folks who aren't familiar, you were not involved with personal investing.
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.700]   Your husband handled much of it.
[00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:01.940]   And following his passing, you were faced with having to learn what to do and how to
[00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.540]   handle your situation.
[00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:09.740]   And so if you would, we're excited to hear about your journey.
[00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:10.740]   Thank you very much.
[00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.720]   And thank you so much for having me here and giving me an opportunity to talk about my
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:18.720]   experiences.
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:26.560]   First, I would like to thank Mel Lindauer and Taylor Laramore because all along they
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.480]   have been so kind and so helpful.
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:37.840]   Before beginning, I would also like to talk about something I've come to believe.
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:46.080]   And my belief has been based on talking to many people, teaching a course for many years
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:55.980]   now, to retirees who are just beginning to invest and then reading more than I ever thought
[00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.760]   I would do.
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:07.640]   And what my belief is, is that there are many, many, many people who are afraid to invest.
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.720]   They don't feel comfortable.
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.480]   They don't understand about investing.
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:22.640]   I think they were like me, and I'm hoping that what I can share will help them feel
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.560]   more comfortable, find joy in investing.
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:35.160]   And behind me there, I have a white swan, and that stands for sleep well at night.
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:41.920]   And that's what I hope people will be able to do, is to sleep well at night.
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.600]   Sylvia, if I can just interrupt for a second, thanks.
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:53.320]   I just want to, for folks not familiar, mention that Mel Lindauer is on this call, and it's
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.960]   an honor to have him here as one of the founders of the Bogleheads, and as you mentioned, Taylor
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.400]   Laramore as well.
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.400]   Yes.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.360]   Well, thank you for that.
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.360]   When I think about my journey, I think about three stages.
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:14.200]   The first stage I call no, no, heck no.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:21.960]   The second stage I think of as, well, I will try and learn a little.
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:28.080]   And the third stage I think of as hello, Jack Bogle.
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.680]   So let me start with the first stage of my journey.
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:42.260]   I didn't start to invest until after I retired, and well after I retired.
[00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.680]   I asked myself, why didn't I start earlier?
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.260]   Maybe like you, you were influenced by your childhood.
[00:03:53.260 --> 00:04:00.920]   My parents were young adults when they encountered the Great Depression.
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.360]   My father lost his job.
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.880]   They had hard times.
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:14.120]   The stock market crash came, and my mother said, never invest in anything but government
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.120]   bonds.
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:21.160]   They will always return your money, and you won't lose a penny.
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:27.600]   I didn't know any better, and so that's what I thought was the way to invest.
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:37.480]   Then when I married, my husband Dave, it turned out, was an enthusiastic market investor.
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.620]   And I had great confidence in him.
[00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:47.200]   When we were young, we had almost no money, and he would invest in penny stocks.
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:56.060]   Penny stocks, as the name implies, are very low cost and usually very, very risky.
[00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:01.360]   He invested in stocks, gold mines in the Philippines.
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.160]   That to me sounded risky, but again, we had very little money.
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:15.440]   He went on to invest in commodities, corn, pork bellies, and I knew so little about the
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:24.160]   market that I thought we could actually have bushels of corn if a bet went wrong.
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.920]   Then he went on to invest in precious metals and tech stocks.
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.880]   That was plan A in our house.
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:34.880]   He did that.
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.700]   I did other things.
[00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:44.920]   I had no plan B. And then he died suddenly, and there I was.
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:51.800]   In Ireland, there's a headstone which says, "Death leaves a heartache.
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.520]   No one can heal.
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.200]   Love leaves a memory no one can steal."
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:07.360]   So for a long time, I had heartaches and memories, and I had to do all those things that some
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:12.020]   of you might do if you lose a loved one.
[00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:19.400]   And like Scarlett O'Hara, I said, "I'll think about investing tomorrow."
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:27.920]   Of course, tomorrow came, and I still didn't know what to do with the funds we had.
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:36.160]   We did have a friend, though, who had really done very well in his career and was doing
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.400]   well in the market.
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:44.040]   He said to me, "I have a financial advisor.
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.160]   He's a great young man.
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.040]   He will take you as a client."
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:53.080]   And I told him to look out after you.
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:07:00.360]   Wow, I felt really comforted that somebody was going to do that for me.
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:04.840]   So I went with this young man and put funds there.
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:12.260]   And very congenial, large practice, well-known in the Washington area.
[00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:18.800]   He put me into mutual funds with fairly high loads.
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.440]   I didn't know anything.
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:24.400]   I didn't really know how to ask.
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:29.000]   But here's where a little turn in my journey came.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.480]   I did want to be a good steward.
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:37.880]   I didn't want to lose whatever money we had, and I wanted to know a little bit about why
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:41.800]   he was doing what he was doing.
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:50.160]   So when I would ask a question about an asset, I'd get in the mail a quarterly report on
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:58.280]   that asset, which often had little print and much, much data.
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:00.000]   It wasn't what I wanted.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.160]   It didn't make me feel any more comfortable, but it was my fault.
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.840]   I didn't know how to ask.
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:17.520]   Then my brother-in-law had a relative, and that relative was investing with a young man
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.080]   in the Chicagoland area.
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:24.600]   He was in a very tony suburb, lots of clients.
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:28.120]   And my brother-in-law said, "Just talk to him."
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:29.840]   So I did.
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.120]   Another very nice young man.
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:35.840]   And he said, "You know, you are paying double.
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:42.960]   You're paying the mutual fund companies, and you're paying your manager, whereas I will
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:48.520]   invest directly in stocks and bonds, and you will only pay once."
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:51.360]   Well, that sounded good to me.
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:53.580]   That sounded logical.
[00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:55.420]   So I switched.
[00:08:55.420 --> 00:09:02.800]   Now I'm going to pause for a moment because I know now for many people, switching is very
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.120]   hard.
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:11.040]   Lots of articles have been written on how hard it is to switch, but I did switch.
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:18.960]   And after a while, that same little niggling thought came, "Do I really know why this financial
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:22.240]   advisor is doing what he's doing?"
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:29.200]   So I asked again some questions, and I said, "I don't want the quarterly reports."
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.200]   He said, "Okay."
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:32.840]   He said, "I've got a book for you."
[00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:40.360]   Well, when I looked at the book, what it turned out to be was a book he was using for one
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:45.000]   of his levels of financial certification.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.240]   It was very dense, lots of numbers, lots of charts.
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:56.080]   I took a deep breath, and I said, "Sylvia, you're not asking the right questions.
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:02.800]   You're not getting to where you want to be with learning."
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:10.520]   And it was at that time, then I said, "Give yourself permission just to do a little learning.
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:16.160]   You don't have to be like Dave, but just do a little."
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:20.520]   So that kind of ended the first part of my journey.
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:23.200]   And I thought, "I'll do three things.
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:26.680]   I will talk to friends and neighbors.
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:34.180]   I will go to the library and look up books, and I'll get on the internet."
[00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:39.580]   You know, when you talk to people, there have been three taboo subjects.
[00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:44.080]   One is sex, one is religion, and one is politics.
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:49.640]   I really think finance could be added in as a fourth subject.
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:54.760]   I never asked people what amount of money they had.
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:58.400]   I just wanted to know what their rationale is.
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:01.840]   Why do they invest the way they did?
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:05.300]   We have a few friends who really were very good.
[00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:07.800]   They were very smart, but they were like Dave.
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:13.080]   They put a lot of time and energy into their investing.
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:16.980]   Another man worked for a large oil company.
[00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:21.640]   He said it was well-run, and that's why he invested there.
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:28.920]   But, you know, others, whether they invested on their own or with financial advisors, I
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:33.680]   didn't get much sense that they understood what they were doing.
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:41.840]   One of my friends said, "I get this report every quarter, and my advisor says, 'Ask me
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:42.840]   questions.'"
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:47.960]   I never do, because I don't know what questions to ask.
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:55.500]   Another friend said, "I have this rubber stamp, and I say to my advisor, 'Please do the right
[00:11:55.500 --> 00:12:00.340]   thing by me, and I will rubber stamp it.'"
[00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:06.380]   I came away thinking, I'm not sure I'm getting much from this, but I do know there are a
[00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:12.540]   lot of people out there who may have some of the issues that I do.
[00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:19.300]   I went to the library, and I cannot tell you why I didn't find Jack Bogle's book, but I
[00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:27.140]   found a number of books, again, that were very difficult for me in terms of what I wanted.
[00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:28.880]   I found the book on dummies.
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:32.340]   I'm sure I learned something there.
[00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:37.380]   But what surprised me was when I went on the internet.
[00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:42.180]   The site that I remember the most now is Morningstar.
[00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:48.980]   Then I found the Bogleheads, and found it was just tremendously helpful, but I hadn't
[00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:54.180]   come to them when I was on Morningstar.
[00:12:54.180 --> 00:13:01.660]   Now I think the time I was on Morningstar was somewhat like the Wild West.
[00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:06.180]   There were probably a dozen forums.
[00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:14.780]   There was a forum on stocks, another on bonds, closed-end funds, mutual funds, probably one
[00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:21.000]   on Schwab, maybe TIAA, TIAA-CREF, and Vanguard.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.300]   And what I decided to do, three things.
[00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:30.980]   I would lurk, I would listen, and I would learn, and you know it was fun.
[00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:39.940]   And I think the more times that learning is fun, the more that I at least do it.
[00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:46.740]   Some of the people on these forums, which people would post their ideas, questions,
[00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:52.780]   and so on, some of these people I think were brilliant investors, and I could listen and
[00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:54.900]   get some ideas.
[00:13:54.900 --> 00:14:00.100]   Some I think were charlatans and really didn't know what they were talking about.
[00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:04.540]   And some would just throw a monkey wrench into conversations.
[00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:10.260]   There were virtual fistfights on some of these sites, and some people would be banned.
[00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:15.060]   So it was kind of fun just to listen in.
[00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:21.420]   Here's what surprised me though when I got onto the Vanguard site.
[00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:29.740]   In my mind there was this old codger, I say that now at my age kind of with a smile, and
[00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:32.420]   I say it very fondly.
[00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:44.340]   His screen name was Limo Man, he was in the Chicago area, and he owned limousine services.
[00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:52.180]   He was such a good man, I think he probably had very little formal education, but what
[00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:55.700]   a street smart man he was.
[00:14:55.700 --> 00:15:00.620]   And he was into Vanguard, into balanced funds.
[00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:05.020]   Balanced funds meaning a fund that has stocks and bonds.
[00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:12.420]   And when someone asked what should I do, how should I invest, he would give them this advice.
[00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:21.780]   He'd say, look at Wellesley and Wellington, those were two bedrock funds in Vanguard.
[00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:31.380]   Wellesley had more bonds, 60%, and Wellington had more stock, 60%.
[00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:37.660]   He said, look at them and make some decisions, put whatever money you want there, keep out
[00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:38.660]   a little.
[00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:47.380]   If you think you're a smart stock picker, pick your stocks and then watch and see who
[00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:54.620]   does better, the professionals at Vanguard, Wellington and Wellesley or you.
[00:15:54.620 --> 00:16:01.420]   If you are better than you can continue with your picks, if not, then you've got your money
[00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:02.420]   safeguarded.
[00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:11.660]   Well, that sounded good to me, and that opened the door for me to look more at Vanguard.
[00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:21.620]   And that's when I found out about Jack Bogle and his philosophy of passive investing index
[00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:25.740]   funds by the entire stock market.
[00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:28.380]   And it was a revelation to me.
[00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:33.060]   I could see my mother investing only in bonds.
[00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:42.380]   My husband being really a great person who did all of this hard work on picking stocks.
[00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:50.500]   But for me, the sweet spot was passive investing, where I could sleep well at night, and I did
[00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:55.420]   not have to worry about which stocks to pick.
[00:16:55.420 --> 00:17:04.000]   Now, I convinced myself of that not only because of the work Jack Bogle did, but I want to
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:12.380]   introduce Warren Buffett that most of you have heard of, the Oracle of Omaha.
[00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:19.060]   It was a number of years ago that he put out his now famous bet.
[00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:25.620]   The bet was a million dollars, and it was for 10 years.
[00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:32.980]   He said he believed that passive investing, investing in an index fund, total market,
[00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:36.060]   would outperform hedge fund managers.
[00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:43.940]   Now, I don't know that much about hedge fund managers, but I tend to think of them as uber
[00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:44.940]   stock pickers.
[00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:45.940]   They are very good.
[00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:50.380]   They have a secret sauce, and they even add something additional.
[00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:54.500]   So they really are top.
[00:17:54.500 --> 00:18:02.740]   And he said, whoever won over that 10-year period, the money would go to a charity of
[00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:04.420]   that person's choice.
[00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:13.580]   Now, as I remember the story, it wasn't even halfway over, or maybe halfway over, when
[00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:21.620]   it became clear that Warren Buffett's passive investing was going to be the winner.
[00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:24.900]   "Wow," I said to myself.
[00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:29.940]   And that's the way it turned out, a lot more details, some fun stuff.
[00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:39.740]   But the girls club of Omaha, Nebraska was a million dollars richer because of his bet.
[00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:49.180]   The second thing I wanted to say that impressed me was Warren Buffett's first wife died, and
[00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:54.620]   his second wife has a trust set up by him.
[00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:58.860]   Warren Buffett manages the Berkshire Hathaway stock.
[00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:06.300]   When he dies, and she's alive, the Berkshire Hathaway stock will be in that trust for a
[00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:12.700]   while, and then his executors are to cash it out, and guess what?
[00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:25.500]   Put it in passive index funds, the total market, S&P 500, 90% and 10% in government bonds.
[00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:33.700]   If this great stock picker feels that his wife, who I'm assuming is ordinary, like the
[00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:40.860]   rest of us in terms of picking, if that person should have her money in passive investing,
[00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:44.860]   well, that sounds good for me.
[00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:57.100]   And then I read that starting in the mid-1920s to today, the S&P 500 has on average returned
[00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:59.860]   10% a year.
[00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:10.020]   So go up, go down, go up, go down, but 10%, I never thought I would make 10%.
[00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:16.620]   But by passive investing, as Jack Bogle said, I would get my fair share.
[00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:23.380]   That gave me great joy, and I could sleep well at night.
[00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:31.020]   So that kind of ends the second part of my journey where I solidified my belief in why
[00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:38.340]   this is so good for so many of us, especially people who think that they're intimidated
[00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:44.900]   by the market, they don't want to do numbers, this is a wonderful way to go.
[00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:49.620]   Now part three was, hello, Jack Bogle.
[00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:57.080]   It turned out that I joined a retirement institute.
[00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:06.700]   There was a man called Bernard Osher, and he left funds across the nation for retirees
[00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:14.760]   to go to their local university and set up a chapter of lifelong learning.
[00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:18.160]   These chapters are all over the country.
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:21.820]   We teach one another skills we have.
[00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:27.660]   I've joined the one at George Mason University, which is excellent.
[00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:35.820]   And it had so many good classes, but I want to tell about two and how they influence me.
[00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:42.740]   One is a financial forum, again, no one asks how much money you have.
[00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:50.380]   But there are people who, like Dave, are very interested in investing, and they talk about
[00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:51.380]   it.
[00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:58.980]   And you can sit, and I learned, I listened, and I learned, and I just picked up good information
[00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:02.420]   that made me feel more comfortable.
[00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:10.400]   There are also writing classes, and they're led by really wonderful people.
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:14.460]   The people attending want to help you.
[00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:21.620]   And in retirement, I thought, well, I'd like to write maybe a memoir about my travels,
[00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:25.340]   my family, things I want to write to grandchildren.
[00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:31.980]   But as I was going through this learning experience, I did a little writing, and people in the
[00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:34.300]   class were helpful.
[00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:42.340]   I often tore my writing apart, but they were very helpful in having me see what people
[00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:44.860]   would want to know.
[00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:47.940]   And I learned from them.
[00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:57.100]   So when I was doing that, to go back to the forum, a man in the forum said, we're looking
[00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:03.600]   for someone to teach a class to beginners who are retired.
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:12.340]   And he said, many cases, a husband and wife, the husband died, he's been doing the investing,
[00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:14.980]   and his wife is lost.
[00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:23.020]   And this man said, there have been occasions where women have lost parts of their funds.
[00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:28.540]   I could really sympathize with it, and said, I'd be happy to teach.
[00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:31.340]   I've been teaching now many years.
[00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:40.020]   I usually teach with a financial advisor, so people can see, here's independent investing,
[00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:43.220]   here's investing with an advisor.
[00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:47.780]   But as I was teaching, a thought came to me.
[00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:51.100]   I've been listening to the experts.
[00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:58.020]   But you know, if I had a shoulder that needed surgery, I'd certainly want to find the expert,
[00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:02.900]   the best doctor I could find, and learn all about that doctor.
[00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:07.660]   But I'd love to talk to his patients.
[00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:09.660]   Was the surgery as good?
[00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:11.940]   Do they have complications?
[00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:12.940]   Were they worried?
[00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:14.460]   Did he reassure them?
[00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:17.900]   I want to talk to some of those people.
[00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:22.660]   And I thought the same about investing.
[00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:25.540]   Was what I learned what other people learned?
[00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:28.220]   Did they have other ideas?
[00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:32.740]   And so I did a search, and I couldn't find anything.
[00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:41.380]   Now, my not finding anything may have been, you know, just my not doing it.
[00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:48.780]   Bill Bernstein, for example, had showed me an article about how women can be better investors
[00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:50.040]   than men.
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:53.600]   I don't think I would have found that without him.
[00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:57.500]   So I thought, well, maybe there's something out there.
[00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:03.820]   I knew a little bit about the Beardstown ladies, but that wasn't quite it.
[00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:08.900]   And sometimes there's a financial advisor who will have a couple of little paragraphs
[00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:09.900]   about clients.
[00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:13.060]   But I wanted to know more.
[00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:18.580]   So I thought, I know the person who will know, and that is Jack Bogle.
[00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:20.900]   So I wrote to him.
[00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:30.240]   It turned out that he had been ill, was no longer the CEO of Vanguard, but had an office
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:33.240]   on the campus with staff.
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:41.080]   And people also tell me that he was very kind in writing to people, writing back to them.
[00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:48.040]   So I have on his stationery, a little handwritten note that said, of course, something like
[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:53.680]   this, of course, women can be as good an investor as men.
[00:25:53.680 --> 00:26:01.860]   And he said, I know of no one, no ordinary person who has written about her experiences.
[00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:04.000]   You may be the first.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.520]   Now, sometimes being the first is not all that good.
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:14.920]   I mean, why wouldn't someone have written about this was in my mind.
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:22.760]   And especially since I was in these classes of memoir, I mean, I knew that memoir today
[00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:24.920]   is a very popular genre.
[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:31.640]   I mean, there are memoirs of people who come to this country may, you know, make it's fantastically
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:32.640]   good.
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:33.640]   They write about it.
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:37.560]   Someone who's been an Olympic star, they write about it.
[00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:43.880]   Someone who's overcome some dreaded background or dreaded disease, and they write about it.
[00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:51.400]   So I wasn't sure why no one had written, but I had written blogs.
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:55.360]   I would write blogs for the family on travel, etc.
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:27:03.940]   So I decided I would write a blog about why I learned what I did, and why Jack Bogle's
[00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:07.880]   investment advice made so much sense to me.
[00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:11.560]   There are 24 posts, it's free on the web.
[00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:16.080]   It's called "Grandma's Investing for Beginners."
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:21.780]   When I was a little halfway through, Jack Bogle died.
[00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:30.660]   So two of the posts really are about him, and I picked some of the quotes he had.
[00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:36.160]   They were really very, very good for me to read again.
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:41.840]   I made a copy of that blog, and I sent it to his wife, Eve.
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:47.240]   And she, like him, must be a very wonderful woman.
[00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:54.080]   She sent me a note saying that this was good to see and was good to hear.
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:58.260]   After that, someone recommended that I do a YouTube video.
[00:27:58.260 --> 00:27:59.520]   So I've done one.
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:03.720]   I did not want to continue to be doing that.
[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:07.840]   So there's one free YouTube video on the web.
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:12.560]   It's called "Grandma Sylvia's Investing for Beginners."
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:19.960]   And then I decided I was going to start my own little adventure in reaching out to people.
[00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:22.520]   So I had business cards made.
[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:29.600]   And when I would go to a restaurant or have some service, I would say to a young person,
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:30.600]   do you invest?
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:32.280]   Do you want to invest?
[00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:34.080]   What do you know about investing?
[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:37.000]   I have something here that could help you.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.240]   And most of them would take them.
[00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:43.080]   Sometimes I'd meet somebody who would say, oh, I was a day trader.
[00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:44.080]   Wow.
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:50.200]   But I loved meeting the young people, and I said, the only thing I ask is, if you make
[00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:52.400]   a million dollars, let me know.
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:55.000]   And I put my email down.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.120]   So this part of the journey is not finished.
[00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:06.240]   I'm trying to figure out how all of us who are adherents of the Bogle philosophy can
[00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:14.560]   reach out to younger people, because many of them have no defined benefit plans.
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:16.840]   Many of them are in the gig economy.
[00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:24.480]   So what can all of us do to help reach young people so that they could have better lives?
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:25.480]   Thank you.
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:26.480]   Great.
[00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:27.480]   Thank you.
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:28.480]   That was great, Sylvia.
[00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:37.680]   So I'll touch on a few things, and then we'll cover some questions.
[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:42.280]   Great to hear you not just speak about Jack Bogle, but also Warren Buffett, who himself
[00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:47.920]   honored Jack Bogle at the 2017 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting.
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:54.240]   And further, he's famously said and put in his annual report that Jack did more for the
[00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:58.560]   individual investor than anyone else that Warren's ever known.
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:01.280]   So nice to hear you add to that.
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:07.560]   So I'll jump into some questions that were submitted in advance via the RSVP for this
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:08.560]   event.
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:11.880]   So these are from Bogleheads, and they're often wide-ranging.
[00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:18.560]   You mentioned connecting with early investors or the younger folks.
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:25.120]   The one question I'll ask you is, what do you think is the best thing beginner investors
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:31.840]   late in life should start with to get their investing life going?
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:34.800]   I think it's never too late.
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:39.840]   As I said, I started well after I retired.
[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:47.040]   I think part of it is to give yourself permission to learn and to feel comfortable.
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:55.160]   I believe it's the feelings people have, that level of comfort that is so important, especially
[00:30:55.160 --> 00:31:04.040]   when the bad times come, and they always do, as we know, that you feel that you can ride
[00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:05.040]   them out.
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:09.760]   You can stay the course, as Jack Bogle would say.
[00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:13.120]   So give yourself time to learn.
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:23.280]   Now, one of the things that I really liked my brother-in-law did was to ask different
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:29.680]   sources to create portfolios for him.
[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:39.280]   He had a financial advisor, has a financial advisor, so he knew what assets he had in
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:47.920]   this portfolio, but he went to three banks and he told them the kind of investor he was.
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:58.200]   They will always ask if you are conservative, if you are more risk taker, and in each case
[00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:03.520]   with no cost, they would create a portfolio for him.
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:05.720]   You could do that at Schwab.
[00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:14.100]   You could go to Vanguard, anywhere, and collect what different experts say that might be good
[00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:15.920]   for you.
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:21.880]   And then what I think is a good idea, but other people may have other ideas, you put
[00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:28.240]   each of these portfolios into a Morningstar spreadsheet.
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:35.840]   We say past performance does not indicate future performance, but you would see something
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:40.280]   about each of these and you could start your learning.
[00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:48.720]   I would also say to people, go to the Boglehead website, talk about your concerns, find out
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:57.480]   what others say, and go slowly, don't make big decisions, and keep going until you feel
[00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:00.600]   comfortable and can sleep well at night.
[00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:01.600]   Okay.
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:02.600]   Fantastic.
[00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:04.160]   Thank you.
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:10.520]   Similarly, this question submitted from our Boglehead audience, what advice do you have
[00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:16.760]   for the lesser or non-financially interested spouse or partner who resists getting more
[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:18.480]   involved?
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:19.840]   And I'll expand on the question.
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:26.480]   I think in the Bogleheads community, a lot of people are the beacon for personal finance
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:28.920]   sounding board.
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:34.960]   And within our social circles, there are many well-educated, super smart people, but they're
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:38.860]   often not interested in personal finance.
[00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:43.560]   So how do you navigate that?
[00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:52.520]   And usually I'm going to say it's the woman, my experience has been, and that was me certainly,
[00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:58.200]   who is not as interested, but it could be either party.
[00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:06.240]   I think that what's important is to have a discussion because the disinterested or less
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:11.720]   interested person, as you said, they're very smart people.
[00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:21.520]   And I say, anyone who can drive a car, follow a recipe, raise children, have a career, do
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:24.320]   any of these things.
[00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:28.960]   Sometimes they don't know how easy it is to invest.
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:37.840]   The other thing that is important is I believe we all want to be good stewards of our money.
[00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:46.000]   And I think that this idea of a plan B, knowing a little so that should you have to become
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:54.280]   involved, you can be the good steward for yourself, for the spouse who is no longer
[00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:59.800]   there, for your family, you do not want to be taken care of.
[00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:09.320]   And my motto now that I tell people of the elevator speech is that investing is as easy
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:16.520]   as buying a cup of coffee and as wonderful as winning the lottery.
[00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:21.320]   So know it's easy and take a little time to learn.
[00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:22.320]   Okay.
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:23.320]   Fantastic.
[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:25.600]   So let's build on that a little.
[00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:33.180]   How did you specifically go from underconfident to, I mean, you went on this journey where
[00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:44.420]   you learned a ton and you were able to find high quality, high integrity sources to learn.
[00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:50.220]   What do you say to the folks who for whatever reason are convinced that they're not capable
[00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:55.220]   of learning, even though they're smart in many other areas of their life, how did you
[00:35:55.220 --> 00:36:01.940]   overcome this lack of confidence and go on to the mastery that ended up, I mean, you
[00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:05.420]   teach courses and you wrote a book.
[00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:12.220]   Well, I've always had some degree of confidence in myself.
[00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:17.300]   I didn't have it in this area, but I love people.
[00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:19.260]   I like to talk to people.
[00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:23.940]   I like to learn and I like to ask questions.
[00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:35.860]   If you feel that you have impediments where you're not as able to reach out, then I think
[00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:39.460]   do whatever you can in little ways.
[00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:42.940]   Don't set high benchmarks.
[00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:50.900]   Do little things, get some supporting people around who can show how to do this, how much
[00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:52.900]   fun it is.
[00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:59.900]   And I used to tell people it's like winning the lottery because you'd hear this chink,
[00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:04.860]   chink, chink of money coming in from your assets.
[00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:11.220]   You need a supportive group, I think, if you feel that you really can't do it.
[00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:14.860]   But I want to emphasize this is not math.
[00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:17.380]   This is not statistics.
[00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:21.740]   This is a philosophy of simplicity.
[00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:23.460]   I hope that helps.
[00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:24.460]   That certainly helps.
[00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:32.940]   So how did you resist the very human inclusion that higher fees or that more expensive and
[00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:35.820]   more complicated is better?
[00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:39.860]   Let me see if I can find this.
[00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:45.980]   I have some of Jack Bogle's quotes here.
[00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:50.900]   And I'm going to show you this one because I think it was a good one.
[00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:53.240]   I listened to Jack Bogle.
[00:37:53.240 --> 00:38:02.940]   He said the grim irony of investing then is that we investors as a group not only do not
[00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:09.620]   get what we pay for, we get precisely what we do not pay for.
[00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:13.740]   So if we pay for nothing, we get everything.
[00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:14.740]   Excellent.
[00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:17.580]   That definitely nails the point.
[00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:23.460]   Something else you mentioned in terms of being a woman and learning, I think maybe this generation
[00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:31.860]   is different, but certainly earlier generations, there may have been a norm to the man handling
[00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:33.900]   the finances.
[00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:40.460]   And there's been a lot written about the differences for women investing versus men investing.
[00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:46.420]   And in your book, you mention you now believe that becoming a good investor is no different
[00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:48.500]   for women than for men.
[00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:52.420]   Can you elaborate on how you came to that realization?
[00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:55.140]   Yes.
[00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:57.900]   I think multiple ways.
[00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:07.180]   One, when I talked to a number of men, I realized that they didn't have a clue either.
[00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:16.660]   And that they may have been, you know, reticent to say anything like that.
[00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:22.900]   But we had a friend who went with a financial advisor, I don't know if I mentioned that.
[00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:29.980]   And when I asked, he said, I, you know, my money's coming in, and they have a great Christmas
[00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:30.980]   party.
[00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:33.740]   That was kind of his idea.
[00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:41.780]   But I think reading about women, and today you are right, that I believe younger women
[00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:46.220]   may have a different worldview in general.
[00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:49.500]   But I've talked to a number of young women.
[00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:55.700]   And part of it is, they're still a lack of interest.
[00:39:55.700 --> 00:40:03.700]   And some of it is not the determination to save even a little so that they can get started.
[00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:06.860]   I don't know the answer.
[00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:12.700]   But I do think that women can be very good investors.
[00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:19.500]   It's been shown, and as I say, Bill Bernstein had this great article, because women tend
[00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:22.300]   to be a little more conservative.
[00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:27.140]   So they're not as apt to do some risky things.
[00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:36.620]   I think if we can just get young people to know how easy it is, and not be in debt, that
[00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:40.300]   they can have very good lives, financially.
[00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:41.660]   Fantastic.
[00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:47.740]   Another question submitted via the RSVP, given the investing knowledge you now have, what
[00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:51.340]   would you have done differently, if anything, during this journey?
[00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:56.020]   And I'll add to that question, a lot of people say, yeah, I learned that lesson the hard
[00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:57.020]   way.
[00:40:57.020 --> 00:41:01.860]   Can you share some lessons you learned the hard way along your journey?
[00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:10.460]   Well, I wish there had been a magic wand, and I had known about the Bogle passive investing.
[00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:15.900]   I mean, it's been around for decades.
[00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:19.420]   I am neither pro nor con financial advisors.
[00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:24.980]   As I said, 95% of my friends have financial advisors.
[00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:32.860]   But I think the industry is not set up so that the passive investing is easy to do.
[00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:40.860]   Although now, this revolution has changed and all the big houses are going to passive
[00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:43.620]   investing one way or the other.
[00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:48.260]   I made, so you could call that a mistake.
[00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:54.180]   I think another mistake is I shied away from anything my husband was doing, because he
[00:41:54.180 --> 00:42:00.380]   was doing all these charts, and he would listen to Louis Rukeyser.
[00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:03.060]   I don't know if any of you remember him.
[00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:10.140]   Rukeyser was enormously clever and funny, and he did a program called Washington Week.
[00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:11.140]   And you would have-
[00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:13.420]   Wall Street Week in Review.
[00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:15.220]   Wall Street Week in Review.
[00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:16.380]   That's right.
[00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:18.460]   And he would have these experts.
[00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:21.140]   One would say, "Buy this bank stock."
[00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:23.580]   The other would say, "Sell this bank stock."
[00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:30.260]   And I thought, you know, if the experts don't agree, you know, I'm not going to do this.
[00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:35.900]   But maybe if I had worked with Dave and come at it from a different direction, maybe we
[00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:43.940]   both would have come up with ways of operating, and it would have been fun for both of us.
[00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:49.820]   I think fun and joy in what you're doing is really important.
[00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:57.780]   As to my mistakes, well, one of my mistakes, and again, I do not blame anyone but myself.
[00:42:57.780 --> 00:43:08.580]   One of my mistakes, I believe, was being sold, not buying, but being sold an annuity in an
[00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:09.580]   IRA.
[00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:17.060]   Now, IRAs mean that your funds are tax-deferred.
[00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:26.240]   And so the benefit of an annuity is not the same as if it was in a taxable account.
[00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:31.700]   I think the reason that happened was I was so conservative.
[00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:37.220]   But when you look into annuities, they are very complex instruments.
[00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:45.820]   In fact, I think it was Richard Thaler, the economist, who said even for economists, annuities
[00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:47.340]   are difficult.
[00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:51.980]   And I had one with all sorts of riders that would...
[00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:56.460]   I think I was paying like maybe over 6% for the fees.
[00:43:56.460 --> 00:44:01.100]   Now, I want to make sure that people know I'm not against annuities.
[00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:07.820]   If you have no defined benefit, annuities are great for many people.
[00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:12.800]   But that was a mistake I made and I didn't know better.
[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:18.420]   And unfortunately, the industry is set up that there's nice commissions to people who
[00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:19.860]   sell them.
[00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:23.060]   So it's kind of a two-edged sword.
[00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:25.580]   That was one of my mistakes.
[00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:27.980]   Okay.
[00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:30.940]   Thanks for sharing.
[00:44:30.940 --> 00:44:34.500]   Something, another question submitted from the Bogleheads.
[00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:35.660]   This may be too personal.
[00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:39.580]   Feel free to say so if it is, but it's a very Boglehead question.
[00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:44.140]   Could you share with us your current asset allocation and how and why you chose that
[00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:47.660]   allocation?
[00:44:47.660 --> 00:44:53.780]   I think I mentioned earlier that when I first started, I would have one or two shares of
[00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:57.060]   a stock because I had free trades.
[00:44:57.060 --> 00:44:59.340]   So I had stocks.
[00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:01.260]   I never went into bonds.
[00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:05.740]   Bonds are much more difficult, I think, for the average person.
[00:45:05.740 --> 00:45:07.960]   But I had closed-end bonds.
[00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:12.780]   I had master limited partnerships, the kind of oil things.
[00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:19.060]   I had all sorts of odd, I think now, stocks.
[00:45:19.060 --> 00:45:27.500]   And once I decided I was going to go toward the simple investing, I have been selling
[00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:37.300]   off, sometimes at a loss, sometimes at a gain, but trying to simplify my portfolio from 60
[00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:45.260]   plus to maybe I have a dozen or so more assets in my portfolio.
[00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:54.780]   I still like the Wellington, which is a balanced fund, and that's probably the only asset I
[00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:58.100]   have that has bonds.
[00:45:58.100 --> 00:46:09.700]   Everything else is in the stock market, either as Vanguard mutual funds or Vanguard ETFs.
[00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:16.700]   I don't know if I'll ever change, but I went with Vanguard, and it's simple for me to buy
[00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:20.080]   within that company.
[00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:28.180]   I'm moving more now towards the total stock market, but because of capital gains and other
[00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:34.060]   things, I don't and can't just liquefy what I did have.
[00:46:34.060 --> 00:46:44.260]   So I am more into VTI, which is the total stock market, index fund, or VOO, which is
[00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:47.300]   the S&P 500.
[00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:56.020]   I have some prime cap, and if any of you have that, you know that it's a good performing
[00:46:56.020 --> 00:46:57.420]   mutual fund.
[00:46:57.420 --> 00:47:03.860]   I think it's been closed for a while, but if it opens, I like that.
[00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:08.260]   I've had some stock for a long time like Costco.
[00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:16.860]   I like Costco, and when I was looking for dividends, Costco was always good because
[00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:22.700]   from time to time, they'd give a big dividend, and it would surprise you, and I kind of like
[00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:23.700]   the joy of that.
[00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:24.700]   I'm sorry.
[00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:25.700]   I'm going to interject here.
[00:47:25.700 --> 00:47:31.100]   Do you think high level, you have a sense of what percent equities, cash, and bonds
[00:47:31.100 --> 00:47:34.660]   you are that you'd want to share?
[00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:38.100]   My bonds must be low.
[00:47:38.100 --> 00:47:40.820]   My equities must be high.
[00:47:40.820 --> 00:47:42.980]   I haven't looked at it recently.
[00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:50.820]   My cash, because I've been drawing down for some other expenses, was high and is getting
[00:47:50.820 --> 00:48:01.080]   lower, but I do want to make a point about that, and that is if you are an investor and
[00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:09.700]   you need your funds, for example, if you don't have a defined benefit plan, I think your
[00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:13.060]   portfolio would look different.
[00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:19.500]   If you need fewer of those funds, and you're saving for children or grandchildren, then
[00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:24.180]   you might have much more stock than bonds.
[00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:33.280]   I tell you, it surprises me that I have more stocks, a higher percentage of stocks when
[00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:37.400]   I never would have done that initially.
[00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:38.960]   Does that help?
[00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:40.120]   Sure.
[00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:45.080]   And then another question submitted from the group via the RSVP function.
[00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:49.280]   Given all that you've been through financially, do you find yourself today tinkering with
[00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:54.240]   your portfolio to try to earn a greater return?
[00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:58.120]   Very, very little.
[00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:05.800]   I do go to Morningstar, and I have my portfolio on Morningstar.
[00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:11.680]   During these bad months and the bad year, I'm like an ostrich, and I stick my head in
[00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:20.180]   the sand, and I don't want to know how much I have lost, but it's been getting better,
[00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:27.140]   and so I will do a look-see on Morningstar, and there are some things that are still performing
[00:49:27.140 --> 00:49:32.400]   less well than VTI, the total stock market.
[00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:37.120]   So I look at those and say, "Do you really want to keep them?"
[00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:40.120]   People get attached to things.
[00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:43.140]   I had Cody there for a while.
[00:49:43.140 --> 00:49:44.680]   I don't have that anymore.
[00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:53.240]   So in that sense, yes, I am tinkering, and I'm trying to get it down to a very simple
[00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:54.240]   portfolio.
[00:49:54.240 --> 00:50:00.480]   If I were to go to Vanguard today with cash, I think I would probably have no more than
[00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:05.160]   three assets, but right now I probably have a dozen.
[00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:06.160]   Okay.
[00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:07.160]   Thanks for sharing.
[00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:12.520]   So another quote I enjoyed from your book was, "There's another thing I learned about
[00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:13.520]   investors.
[00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:17.940]   They're happy to tell you about their big win, but seem to forget their losses."
[00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:25.640]   Can you tell us a bit about that realization and why it's important?
[00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:37.440]   I believe we're all subject to the kind of glow that winning entails, and if someone
[00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:44.800]   says, "I made a killing in X, Y, or Z," we kind of look up to that person, think that
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:53.560]   they maybe know more, and it may be true that that was a good investment, but it may be
[00:50:53.560 --> 00:51:00.280]   true that there were eight or nine investments which were terrible investments.
[00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:08.720]   And so when I say people tend to talk about the things that they did well and kind of
[00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:17.760]   shy away from the problems they had, to me that means whenever anyone does talk about
[00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:22.240]   it in a forum, I want to look carefully.
[00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:29.440]   I've only made a few mistakes in taking surface information and acting on it.
[00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:32.200]   I try not to do that anymore.
[00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:33.200]   Okay.
[00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:39.240]   So maybe building on that, can you share some of the challenges you initially faced when
[00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:44.200]   you took control of your finances?
[00:51:44.200 --> 00:52:01.480]   Well, I had to move my money out of where the second advisor was, and that was difficult.
[00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:11.520]   It turns out that I wanted to put my monies into these passive funds, which had in Vanguard
[00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:14.960]   very low fees.
[00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:24.440]   But this young man was willing to do it, but his company still wanted to charge me 1% of
[00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:27.120]   assets under management.
[00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:29.880]   And I said, "That doesn't make sense.
[00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:32.640]   These are passive investments.
[00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:36.720]   There really is no management as such."
[00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:45.240]   But that was a company rule, and so that was a difficulty, and there were several phone
[00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:52.320]   calls that went back and forth until we realized it just wasn't going to work out.
[00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:54.980]   Got it.
[00:52:54.980 --> 00:53:02.360]   So I'm also curious, Sylvia, if you'll share more personally how you stay active, how you
[00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:10.760]   stay engaged, how you maintain your health, both physically and cognitively.
[00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:15.120]   I think people would be very interested in hearing from you.
[00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:21.040]   Well, I'm in my 80s, and I'm creaky.
[00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:29.600]   I have a wonderful sister and brother-in-law, and my husband and I visit them, and we try
[00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:34.240]   to be active because they're younger and they're active.
[00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:40.880]   I have a wonderful daughter and son-in-law, and they're active, and I have a little grandson,
[00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:46.200]   and so part of me tells me that I have to be active.
[00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:53.280]   This is not a plug for Apple, but my Apple Watch tells me every day what I've done in
[00:53:53.280 --> 00:54:01.400]   terms of exercise, because my husband is 90, and I feel we need to do both things.
[00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:03.360]   We have a gym membership.
[00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:13.920]   We go three times a week to different trainers, one for strength, one for more flexibility,
[00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:16.160]   someone who comes to the house.
[00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:23.400]   I'm thinking that the more we can do to stay physically active, the better, and of course,
[00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:28.800]   lifelong has always been I could lose another pound.
[00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:32.680]   That's funny.
[00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:41.200]   I want to remind folks, I've been semi-monitoring the chat, and folks should feel free to submit
[00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:46.360]   questions via the chat, and we'll turn it over to live questions as well, so feel free
[00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:53.240]   to raise your hand if you'd rather not put questions in the chat for Sylvia.
[00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:59.320]   In the absence of other questions, I'll continue, but happy to turn it over to chat questions
[00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:04.080]   or audience questions when we have questions.
[00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:09.880]   Another quote from your book, Sylvia, "Good advice isn't cheap, neither is bad advice."
[00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:11.800]   Can you tell us more about that?
[00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:20.560]   Well, each chapter of the book has an epigram, something that I hoped would spark interest
[00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:23.600]   in the chapter.
[00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:30.560]   What you read was the epigram for the chapter on financial advisors.
[00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:36.880]   There's a chapter on financial advisors and a chapter on financial planners.
[00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:43.760]   I think Jason Zwieg from the Wall Street Journal had some good articles about the difference
[00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:53.520]   and the importance of the difference between the two, but I was looking for an epigram
[00:55:53.520 --> 00:56:00.520]   that was neutral or positive about financial advisors.
[00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:11.480]   And again, this could be me, but I could find nothing that was giving a positive, that I
[00:56:11.480 --> 00:56:18.440]   could use as a positive quote, so I made up one, and here I've got this little, this one.
[00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:27.160]   It said, "Good advice isn't cheap, neither is bad advice," because when you're given
[00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:33.900]   bad advice and you don't know it, you are wasting time and money.
[00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:40.520]   And it may not be deliberately bad, it may not be someone who is malicious, it may just
[00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:47.040]   not be right for you, and you are the person who has to make that decision.
[00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:52.440]   You're the one who has to know, "Is this advice the right advice for me?"
[00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:54.000]   So that's how it came up.
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:55.000]   Okay, fantastic.
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:57.960]   You also write a bit about tuning out the noise.
[00:56:57.960 --> 00:57:03.980]   I think there's more information than ever, and it's ever-increasing, and it's hard to
[00:57:03.980 --> 00:57:08.120]   escape it sometimes if you're just naturally immersed in it.
[00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:14.720]   Can you talk about how you have been able to tune out the noise?
[00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:25.240]   Well, I love the computer, I love the internet, but I'm not into television that much.
[00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:35.840]   I'm more into headline news, and so I ask myself when I read a headline, "Is that something
[00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:42.480]   that I want to know, need to know, and will it help me in some way?"
[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:50.640]   I think because I'm not that much into watching television or listening to a lot of news programs,
[00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:54.560]   that that's been a big help for me.
[00:57:54.560 --> 00:58:03.360]   And just knowing that, you know, Jack Bogle's words about noise, just knowing that there
[00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:10.240]   is so much out there and you need to be on guard, I think that's a good safeguard.
[00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:13.840]   Okay, excellent.
[00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:19.240]   Another quote, "Of all my mistakes, my biggest mistake was that I didn't start investing
[00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:20.240]   sooner."
[00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:26.400]   So I think in our own lives, whether Bogleheads – I think the Bogleheads community, I know
[00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:27.400]   it's wide-ranging.
[00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:32.320]   There are many mature and informed investors, but there are also new arrivals kind of early
[00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:37.520]   in their journey, but even outside of the Bogleheads community, our social circle often
[00:58:37.520 --> 00:58:42.880]   has young people who say they don't have enough to invest, not realizing the power
[00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:44.460]   of time and compounding.
[00:58:44.460 --> 00:58:50.700]   So when you said you learned that you could have or should have started investing sooner,
[00:58:50.700 --> 00:58:56.320]   can you elaborate on how to better connect with folks who are hesitant to start for whatever
[00:58:56.320 --> 00:59:00.280]   reason, including they may think they don't have enough to start?
[00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:08.600]   Yes, let me first say that I was just talking to a young woman when I was getting tires
[00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:18.760]   and I was asking her about investing, and she said, "I've got $11,000 in debt."
[00:59:18.760 --> 00:59:27.760]   Well, I think we all know that you must pay your debt down first, but if you have a strategy
[00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:36.040]   for how you are looking at your life, how you're prioritizing what you do, what's important
[00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:42.960]   for short-term needs and gratifications, and what's important for long-term, then I think
[00:59:42.960 --> 00:59:48.480]   with that kind of an analysis, you can make the decisions.
[00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:52.760]   And my mother would always save a penny or two there.
[00:59:52.760 --> 01:00:00.320]   And I tell the story that in 10 years, she was always able to buy a new car for my dad
[01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:03.760]   by saving a penny or two here and there.
[01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:11.760]   Now, we also know that there are people who have two jobs and they still are not able
[01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:13.160]   to save.
[01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:20.600]   And that's a problem that I think we maybe as a society have to address.
[01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:28.800]   But I believe with many people, it's a decision-making, and if they can become convinced how much
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:34.560]   better their lives will be, I think they can make that change.
[01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:35.560]   Okay.
[01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:36.560]   Excellent.
[01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:39.080]   Thanks for sharing.
[01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:45.040]   Changing topics, what advice would you give to someone who suddenly finds themselves responsible
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:49.120]   for their family's financial affairs?
[01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:59.800]   Well, I should have said early on, of course, I'm not a financial advisor and I can only
[01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:04.760]   rely on my own sense of what I would do.
[01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:11.160]   But I don't know what it means when they are responsible for their financial affairs.
[01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:19.080]   Does that mean helping them take their resources and learn how to manage it?
[01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:22.640]   Does that mean paying their bills?
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:30.800]   I think we would have to go in more detail to what that actually means.
[01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:36.520]   It's always important to me to help family.
[01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:38.880]   Family is very important.
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:48.840]   But it's also important to keep yourself financially intact and not do things which will jeopardize
[01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:51.280]   your own standing.
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:58.880]   If someone through no fault of their own has terrible medical bills, then how do you work
[01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:04.600]   with that person to get the resources to get what they need?
[01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:11.720]   May not be a perfect solution, but you should also think of safeguarding your own financial
[01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:13.440]   well-being.
[01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:22.800]   If the situation was because of bad decision-making, then even more so to be a resource, to be
[01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:30.240]   a help, but to draw a line somewhere about what you can and cannot do.
[01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:31.240]   Great.
[01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:32.240]   Thanks.
[01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:35.640]   Jim, I see a question in the chat that is definitely worth asking.
[01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:38.000]   Do you want to take it or shall I read it?
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.960]   Why don't you just take it?
[01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:41.960]   Okay.
[01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:47.960]   Sylvia, from the chat, this is as a grandmother too, I currently have five grandchildren between
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:50.920]   the ages of 18 and 23.
[01:02:50.920 --> 01:03:00.080]   Any suggestions on how to introduce the idea of investing with them?
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:05.480]   First of all, congratulations on having five grandchildren of that age.
[01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:09.360]   I think that's wonderful.
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:18.200]   It might be their personalities too, and talking with each individually, I think is how I might
[01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:20.560]   approach it.
[01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:28.480]   I don't know the books that are out now for teenagers and young adults, but I do think
[01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:38.080]   that giving young adults some sense of what could be in their future if they made small
[01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:44.440]   changes in their lives and how they could be enriched.
[01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:53.800]   It doesn't take long to come up with some numbers and use the compound interest formula
[01:03:53.800 --> 01:04:01.920]   to show how a person, when they're that age, could become a millionaire if they invested
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:07.160]   wisely, especially with low fees.
[01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:16.240]   I guess I would also hope that as a grandmother, you might be modeling some of those behaviors
[01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:23.720]   so they could say, "Wow, my grandmother does this," and look at her success.
[01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:28.960]   If you have enthusiasm for it, that conveys a lot.
[01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:33.040]   Okay, fantastic.
[01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:34.040]   Something else.
[01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:35.640]   I want to reiterate for the crowd.
[01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:42.000]   Feel free to raise your hand via Zoom if you want to ask a live question or continue to
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.240]   put questions into the chat.
[01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:51.200]   In the absence of additional questions, Sylvia, can you elaborate on how you discerned good
[01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:57.080]   sources, like high-integrity, high-quality sources to learn from, given there's so much
[01:04:57.080 --> 01:04:58.640]   out there now?
[01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:06.360]   Well, that's a wonderful question.
[01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:10.880]   There are many - let me give you a couple of examples.
[01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:20.560]   There are many YouTube videos, and there are many blogs, and I've looked at a fair number
[01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:25.800]   and the landscape changes.
[01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:36.040]   I think if you have a few guiding principles like the Bogleheads have in terms of low cost,
[01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:44.960]   low expenses, that that will help as you look at sites.
[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:54.160]   I guess that I'm always suspect when something seems too good to be true.
[01:05:54.160 --> 01:06:04.400]   I think the best thing is to step back and think about it for a while, but not get so
[01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:12.920]   involved in so many sites or so much reading that it kind of overpowers you.
[01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:18.600]   I'm not sure that I'm answering what the person has in mind.
[01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:25.760]   I just found some YouTube sites not very good, but on the other hand, I came across some
[01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:35.640]   that were great, and maybe it's an internal sense you gather after a while, but just don't
[01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:44.680]   make decisions based on some recommendations that may not have enough background information
[01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:46.160]   for you.
[01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:49.200]   Okay, that's helpful.
[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:54.440]   Something else you wrote about stay invested rather than jumping in and out of the market.
[01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:57.080]   How do you resist the very human temptation?
[01:06:57.080 --> 01:07:04.080]   I think Bogleheads largely know the fundamentals of trying to not time the market, but this
[01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:10.960]   very human, oh, the market is at its peak or you want to wait till it's dropped.
[01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:19.320]   How did you separate the emotional side of the intellectual knowledge we learn, but our
[01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:24.400]   human tendencies fight against that sometimes?
[01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:32.280]   Yes, I think my biggest strategy is that I tune out.
[01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:41.680]   It may be this idea of the ostrich with her head in the sand, but also I have a defined
[01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:45.280]   benefit of pension.
[01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:53.760]   I think I can hold my breath and I think I can believe Jack Bogle and Warren Buffett
[01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:56.640]   and believe in the long term.
[01:07:56.640 --> 01:08:04.000]   Warren Buffett is very strong on America and that things over time will continue to be
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.280]   good.
[01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:13.560]   I think if you have that faith and you know that your income from a pension, for example,
[01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:20.520]   is there every month, I think you can look at these scary times a little different.
[01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:28.480]   If I was solely dependent on my investments, I might have a different perspective.
[01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:36.000]   I might be much more concerned about the ups and downs and in fact, for some people, I
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:43.520]   do believe that they, because of their situation, might be better not being in the market.
[01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:52.520]   They should be in government bonds or annuities where there is a standard that they can count
[01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:53.960]   on.
[01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:58.400]   For me, I tend to tune out.
[01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:07.440]   I won't listen to things when things are going bad and I'll get on with other parts of my
[01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:08.440]   life.
[01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:09.600]   Okay, makes sense.
[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:13.120]   Something else you wrote about, you had to overcome your mother's advice to never lose
[01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:14.320]   a penny.
[01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:18.080]   You've also written that to make money in the market, you have to be willing to take
[01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:19.800]   certain risks.
[01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:27.440]   Can you elaborate on that because it's a conceptual change within yourself and I think a lot of
[01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:30.960]   people struggle with that.
[01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:32.520]   Yes.
[01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:40.840]   Again, I think it's very dependent on your situation.
[01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:48.280]   If it's going to have a big impact on your quality of learning, quality of living, if
[01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:58.680]   you lose a penny or two, then that's very different than if you can wait out the storms.
[01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:08.060]   It took me so long, as I say, it was well into retirement because of that advice, which
[01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:15.320]   was very good advice from her perspective, but then I saw how Dave invested.
[01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:24.680]   When I listened to so many people and heard what Jack Bogle had to say and believe Warren
[01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:33.920]   Buffett had to say, I think it was a gradual, emotional feeling, not only cognitive thinking
[01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:42.920]   about it, but an emotional feeling that I did not have to be so super worried.
[01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:50.440]   Once you've gone through one bad stretch and you see that the market has come back, wow,
[01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:57.200]   you may have lost 10%, but then the next year it comes back, I think you have hope.
[01:10:57.200 --> 01:11:03.200]   Now, if we ever got into a stretch, as has happened around the world, where it's five
[01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:07.120]   years or more, I mean, that might test me.
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:08.120]   Okay.
[01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:09.120]   Great.
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:14.600]   Speaking of testing you, there are some people who I think are born Bogleheads.
[01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:22.440]   They would be frugal and conscientious investors versus some people who are born spenders.
[01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:30.480]   What did you have to fight against your own natural tendencies to adopt versus what came
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:36.120]   very naturally to you as you learned, say, Boglehead philosophy?
[01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:40.600]   Are we talking about spending or saving?
[01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:44.760]   Under that umbrella in broadly personal finance, let's say you learned some things and once
[01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:50.640]   they crystallized, they came naturally to you because they aligned with your tendencies.
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:58.980]   But a lot of folks have different tendencies and saving and investing may not be as natural
[01:11:58.980 --> 01:12:02.100]   to them, but it's not out of reach either.
[01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:08.320]   What were some examples that you had to do either mental gymnastics for, or you had to
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:13.720]   fight against your natural tendencies to achieve what you knew was good for you?
[01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:23.880]   Well, I'll go back to my mother and I think her stories of how you can have a very good
[01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:25.840]   life.
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:28.520]   We never had a lot.
[01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:37.120]   We never went out to restaurants, but we traveled all over the country, camping.
[01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:38.560]   We had music lessons.
[01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:45.800]   We had a lot of things, but she was a wonderful budget person.
[01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:53.600]   And so I think that when you call it a natural tendency, I think that I saw that you can
[01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:58.400]   have a very good life without spending a lot of money.
[01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:04.240]   And let me interject that today there's this movement fired.
[01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:12.240]   I think it's financial independence, retire early, and people are making decisions.
[01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:15.480]   Maybe they did not have modeling.
[01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:23.640]   Maybe it didn't come natural to them, but they decided that they wanted to be free of
[01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:33.440]   jobs, free of worry at an earlier age, and they made decisions that would allow them
[01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:35.100]   to do that.
[01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:43.620]   So for me, I think I had that advantage of having the assurance that if you do save,
[01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:57.420]   you can use it later for things you want, but you don't have to spend a lot to be happy.
[01:13:57.420 --> 01:13:58.420]   Excellent.
[01:13:58.420 --> 01:14:03.340]   Well, I think you're preaching to the choir.
[01:14:03.340 --> 01:14:07.700]   So something else in terms of your learning journey after you had a good handle on the
[01:14:07.700 --> 01:14:14.180]   fundamentals and again, you went on to teach courses in it, obviously written a book, how
[01:14:14.180 --> 01:14:18.860]   incrementally did you add to that knowledge base?
[01:14:18.860 --> 01:14:25.740]   Were you pursuing more complicated things or was there a sufficiency and contentedness
[01:14:25.740 --> 01:14:33.380]   that you weren't missing out on things that you didn't know?
[01:14:33.380 --> 01:14:42.140]   I don't believe I have pursued it more knowledge with great vigor.
[01:14:42.140 --> 01:14:55.100]   I will do some, but it tends to be more incidental and the things that I do, if they've confirmed
[01:14:55.100 --> 01:15:02.640]   what I think is the right thing to do, then I'm kind of even less likely to do it.
[01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:07.460]   I have some other writing that I'm interested in doing.
[01:15:07.460 --> 01:15:17.740]   And so I can kind of leave this and let it perk along on its own.
[01:15:17.740 --> 01:15:19.480]   And that's one of the joys.
[01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:22.340]   That's why it's a sweet spot for me.
[01:15:22.340 --> 01:15:28.180]   I don't have to keep pulling the tree up by the roots to see how it's doing.
[01:15:28.180 --> 01:15:32.060]   I don't have to keep looking at the pot if it's boiling.
[01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:37.100]   I just let it sit there and I go on with other things.
[01:15:37.100 --> 01:15:38.660]   Fantastic.
[01:15:38.660 --> 01:15:44.100]   So we're coming up to 9.20 Eastern, so an hour and 20 minutes.
[01:15:44.100 --> 01:15:48.700]   I'll again remind folks, feel free to submit questions in the chat or raise your hand if
[01:15:48.700 --> 01:15:53.020]   you'd like to ask a question of Sylvia directly.
[01:15:53.020 --> 01:15:59.820]   In the absence of additional audience questions, Sylvia, in writing this book, what were some
[01:15:59.820 --> 01:16:05.740]   of the, apart from what you've mentioned already, what were some of the big ideas or main goals
[01:16:05.740 --> 01:16:13.980]   of sharing via the book, your goal in getting your message out there?
[01:16:13.980 --> 01:16:18.260]   I really wanted to address the emotional issue.
[01:16:18.260 --> 01:16:26.780]   I think there's plenty out there of knowledge and facts, the cognitive, but I believe that
[01:16:26.780 --> 01:16:31.820]   so much in life is on the emotional side.
[01:16:31.820 --> 01:16:38.980]   How we feel about something, whether we feel competent, what are ... I used to say the
[01:16:38.980 --> 01:16:41.660]   tapes in our head.
[01:16:41.660 --> 01:16:48.100]   There are children who are raised and their parents give them so many good things.
[01:16:48.100 --> 01:16:53.500]   Those children have self-reliance, they have resiliency.
[01:16:53.500 --> 01:17:00.620]   Other children may have different tapes in their heads because of what parents or others
[01:17:00.620 --> 01:17:02.940]   have said to them.
[01:17:02.940 --> 01:17:09.140]   I wanted to help erase some of those tapes in their heads.
[01:17:09.140 --> 01:17:15.580]   Now, I do say that I worked with a wonderful person, a writing coach.
[01:17:15.580 --> 01:17:17.300]   I'm not a writer.
[01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:23.980]   This is my first real initiative.
[01:17:23.980 --> 01:17:28.500]   He would take my writing and say, "You want stories.
[01:17:28.500 --> 01:17:31.500]   You want to connect with people, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah."
[01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:34.060]   Then I worked with a wonderful editor.
[01:17:34.060 --> 01:17:37.820]   She kept saying, "Tapes in your head, that's too old.
[01:17:37.820 --> 01:17:40.580]   People won't understand tapes in your head.
[01:17:40.580 --> 01:17:41.820]   Do sound bites."
[01:17:41.820 --> 01:17:47.820]   I think the book says sound bites, but to me, it is still tapes in our head.
[01:17:47.820 --> 01:17:50.980]   What is our self-talk?
[01:17:50.980 --> 01:17:58.540]   If we think that the market requires a great deal of expertise, if we think the market
[01:17:58.540 --> 01:18:10.380]   requires heavy-duty mathematics, if we think the market requires just certain innate abilities,
[01:18:10.380 --> 01:18:15.660]   then we're not going to go forward as easily.
[01:18:15.660 --> 01:18:17.820]   That's what I wanted to stress.
[01:18:17.820 --> 01:18:27.940]   I wanted to stress that I had insecurities, but that today it is so easy and anyone can
[01:18:27.940 --> 01:18:29.180]   do it.
[01:18:29.180 --> 01:18:38.380]   I wanted women and men to say, "Oh, this is as easy as so many other things in life."
[01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:48.780]   It was really that emotional piece, and a bit about the joy when you find that you are
[01:18:48.780 --> 01:18:55.980]   able to look at the world in terms of companies, what they provide.
[01:18:55.980 --> 01:19:02.220]   I think I mentioned some of Journey to Jamestown.
[01:19:02.220 --> 01:19:08.420]   When we were looking around, I found out about the Jamestown Company, which I had learned
[01:19:08.420 --> 01:19:17.340]   in school, but I never really realized the financial implications.
[01:19:17.340 --> 01:19:25.820]   Much of having some interest in investing perks your interest in some of the things
[01:19:25.820 --> 01:19:27.700]   going on in the world.
[01:19:27.700 --> 01:19:32.940]   But today, now, what is going to happen with alternative energy?
[01:19:32.940 --> 01:19:41.260]   Are we going to find a time when it will be so beneficial to the world and to poor people
[01:19:41.260 --> 01:19:44.660]   to have solar energy?
[01:19:44.660 --> 01:19:50.700]   That's just a big area, and of course, it has implications for the stock market.
[01:19:50.700 --> 01:19:59.540]   I wanted to help people find that joy and to overcome personal fear.
[01:19:59.540 --> 01:20:03.060]   Okay, great.
[01:20:03.060 --> 01:20:09.220]   Before I turn it over to Jim, Lady Geek, and even Mel as a guest speaker for any closing
[01:20:09.220 --> 01:20:13.340]   comments, I have another question for you, perhaps my last.
[01:20:13.340 --> 01:20:16.820]   It'll be, I'll say, a holistic lifestyle question.
[01:20:16.820 --> 01:20:24.020]   A lot of Bogleheads have been so successful at saving and investing and living a meaningful,
[01:20:24.020 --> 01:20:27.860]   thoughtful life, a fulfilling one, the way you described, you don't need to spend a lot
[01:20:27.860 --> 01:20:32.060]   of money to have a good life or to enjoy oneself.
[01:20:32.060 --> 01:20:39.300]   A lot of Bogleheads are finding in their later years a challenge to spend money.
[01:20:39.300 --> 01:20:48.340]   What has brought you joy to spend on, or do you have this challenge of finding things
[01:20:48.340 --> 01:20:53.140]   to spend on to add joy to your life?
[01:20:53.140 --> 01:20:58.460]   Not joy from spending, but what have you found worthwhile to spend on?
[01:20:58.460 --> 01:21:12.260]   Yes, I think like many people, when your major life responsibilities, your family, your career,
[01:21:12.260 --> 01:21:19.820]   when that is a finished part and you're on to this stage of life, whatever your age is,
[01:21:19.820 --> 01:21:30.020]   then this idea of spending, which is sometimes an anathema, we've got built in habits of
[01:21:30.020 --> 01:21:37.980]   what we think we should do, that it takes some learning, and that's why I think it's
[01:21:37.980 --> 01:21:46.100]   always good to be around people to see what they're doing, how they're learning.
[01:21:46.100 --> 01:21:58.300]   What I find joy in is doing some small work with our universities in terms of trying to
[01:21:58.300 --> 01:22:08.360]   set up scholarships for young people, or to do things with the family where we can get
[01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:18.980]   together and maybe I can put in a little bit more of the assets and bring people together,
[01:22:18.980 --> 01:22:24.820]   where when families are scattered, sometimes we're not able to do it.
[01:22:24.820 --> 01:22:34.700]   Also to think of some of the people in the family who are having harder lives and to
[01:22:34.700 --> 01:22:38.820]   provide them with some resources.
[01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:51.460]   So it's both close to home, and it's looking at the community, and in some ways this development
[01:22:51.460 --> 01:23:00.380]   of the book is not a money maker, but I'm hoping if it ever makes money that I can put
[01:23:00.380 --> 01:23:09.940]   it in scholarships and to look to the next generation, but I am also a selfish person
[01:23:09.940 --> 01:23:18.700]   in the sense that I still want to get out as much as I can to do things, so I think
[01:23:18.700 --> 01:23:26.500]   it's that balance where we are trying to look both at a fulfilling life for ourselves, but
[01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:33.100]   then what are the needs of our close family, our friends, and our community.
[01:23:33.100 --> 01:23:34.740]   Wonderful.
[01:23:34.740 --> 01:23:40.180]   Great to hear your work for scholarships and the other things you mentioned.
[01:23:40.180 --> 01:23:46.620]   So again, we're approaching an hour and a half, and I think we're very grateful for
[01:23:46.620 --> 01:23:49.100]   what you shared, Sylvia.
[01:23:49.100 --> 01:23:56.420]   Mel, as a special guest attendee, do you want to share any comments?
[01:23:56.420 --> 01:24:04.700]   Well, I'd just like to say that I was glad to help Sylvia in any way I could on her book
[01:24:04.700 --> 01:24:13.580]   because I think it's needed, and we're all aiming for the same goal, and that's to help
[01:24:13.580 --> 01:24:19.220]   other people avoid the mistakes that we made and what we learned along the way, and I can
[01:24:19.220 --> 01:24:21.220]   tell you that I made every mistake.
[01:24:21.220 --> 01:24:27.220]   Fortunately, I started very young and made all the mistakes when I was young and didn't
[01:24:27.220 --> 01:24:35.120]   have a lot of money, so it's great to see people like you doing what you can to help
[01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:41.300]   the people who need help, so thanks again for what you're doing, and thanks for appearing
[01:24:41.300 --> 01:24:42.300]   tonight.
[01:24:42.300 --> 01:24:43.300]   Great.
[01:24:43.300 --> 01:24:48.020]   Thanks for those comments, Mel, and obviously, thanks for what you do, and I'm sorry, Sylvia,
[01:24:48.020 --> 01:24:49.180]   you may have had a response.
[01:24:49.180 --> 01:24:57.340]   Well, no, I think that it's people like Mel and Taylor, and I must say that Taylor and
[01:24:57.340 --> 01:25:06.940]   his wife were very helpful in reading some of what I had written, and when people are
[01:25:06.940 --> 01:25:11.860]   willing to give you their time, I think that's another resource we have.
[01:25:11.860 --> 01:25:21.480]   It's not just money, but it is our time, and so how do we reach out to people and give
[01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:29.220]   our time to help them have good lives, and finance is certainly a part of it.
[01:25:29.220 --> 01:25:33.020]   Wonderful, and I see Miriam just joined.
[01:25:33.020 --> 01:25:34.660]   Hello, Miriam.
[01:25:34.660 --> 01:25:35.660]   Hi.
[01:25:35.660 --> 01:25:39.340]   And for Lady Geek, did you have any closing comments?
[01:25:39.340 --> 01:25:45.100]   Well, Sylvia, I'd like to thank you for joining us tonight, and one of your goals was to educate
[01:25:45.100 --> 01:25:51.260]   people, and you did that, and the YouTube video will help educate many, many more people,
[01:25:51.260 --> 01:25:52.260]   so thank you again.
[01:25:52.260 --> 01:25:54.740]   Well, thank you for all you do.
[01:25:54.740 --> 01:25:58.900]   Yeah, from Lady Geek, yeah, just thank you.
[01:25:58.900 --> 01:26:04.220]   I mean, it's already been said, but thank you for showing up.
[01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:05.220]   Thank you for the discussion.
[01:26:05.220 --> 01:26:10.540]   It was quite a different perspective, because people come in and they want to start talking
[01:26:10.540 --> 01:26:11.540]   about technical details.
[01:26:11.540 --> 01:26:18.140]   You just told your story, and I think that's quite different and quite interesting, so
[01:26:18.140 --> 01:26:19.140]   thanks.
[01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:27.380]   Well, thank you, and this group is composed of so many, I'm going to say good-hearted,
[01:26:27.380 --> 01:26:35.540]   the old-fashioned words, good-hearted people who are there for others, and I feel privileged
[01:26:35.540 --> 01:26:41.140]   to be a part of it, and of course, Jack Bogle.
[01:26:41.140 --> 01:26:49.220]   One of the things, I didn't come up here, and I don't know if it would be timely, but
[01:26:49.220 --> 01:27:00.900]   I have in back of me a poster when I talked to Gus Sautter, who was one of Jack's close
[01:27:00.900 --> 01:27:01.900]   associates.
[01:27:01.900 --> 01:27:08.780]   I guess he worked for Jack, and what happened when they were first introducing the idea
[01:27:08.780 --> 01:27:17.180]   and how much pushback they got, and so I keep that little poster there that exchange-traded
[01:27:17.180 --> 01:27:21.440]   funds are un-American.
[01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:22.700]   Index funds.
[01:27:22.700 --> 01:27:24.140]   Index funds, yeah.
[01:27:24.140 --> 01:27:25.140]   Right.
[01:27:25.140 --> 01:27:31.820]   Maybe elaborate on that, because out of context, it's not clear when that was or who put that
[01:27:31.820 --> 01:27:34.380]   out and why they did.
[01:27:34.380 --> 01:27:35.860]   You want me to do that now?
[01:27:35.860 --> 01:27:36.860]   If you'd like.
[01:27:36.860 --> 01:27:37.860]   Sure.
[01:27:37.860 --> 01:27:45.900]   Well, I think it was Mel that got me in touch with Gus, and I had a long conversation with
[01:27:45.900 --> 01:27:54.500]   him, and he's retired, but I think he was the first global something or something at
[01:27:54.500 --> 01:28:04.980]   Vanguard, and correct me if I'm wrong, but I think this was in the 1970s when Jack had
[01:28:04.980 --> 01:28:14.180]   come out with passive investing, and of course, he was wanted at many, many places and conferences,
[01:28:14.180 --> 01:28:18.820]   and sometimes he would go, and sometimes he would send Gus.
[01:28:18.820 --> 01:28:32.340]   Well, Gus went to one conference, and he was on the stage with a financial advisor, and
[01:28:32.340 --> 01:28:34.540]   that person was very good.
[01:28:34.540 --> 01:28:41.900]   I don't know if he was like a Peter Lynch, but he was one that kind of went beyond and
[01:28:41.900 --> 01:28:50.580]   always did well for his clients beating the S&P 500, and Gus said, "I still held my ground,"
[01:28:50.580 --> 01:28:57.180]   even though they found this example, and then Gus went to another conference, and he was
[01:28:57.180 --> 01:29:05.100]   on the stage, and lo and behold, there was this same man who had beat the odds and beat
[01:29:05.100 --> 01:29:06.740]   the S&P 500.
[01:29:06.740 --> 01:29:13.220]   Well, after about three or four times, Gus thought to himself, "They can't find another
[01:29:13.220 --> 01:29:24.260]   person who has beat the S&P," and then I think it was he who said that there was a company.
[01:29:24.260 --> 01:29:33.420]   I don't remember which one it was, but it was a financial company, financial services,
[01:29:33.420 --> 01:29:39.060]   and they put this poster out which said, "Help stamp out index funds.
[01:29:39.060 --> 01:29:48.460]   They are un-American," and of course, today, we all know that Jack revolutionized the industry
[01:29:48.460 --> 01:29:55.740]   to now where all the big houses are following suit, so I just thought that was very funny.
[01:29:55.740 --> 01:29:56.740]   It is.
[01:29:56.740 --> 01:30:01.140]   It is, and Miriam, did you have any comments you wanted to share?
[01:30:01.140 --> 01:30:04.100]   I know you joined late, so feel free.
[01:30:04.100 --> 01:30:05.100]   Thank you.
[01:30:05.100 --> 01:30:08.500]   Thank you for coming, Sylvia.
[01:30:08.500 --> 01:30:17.960]   I know that your book and portions of your book are in the Bogleheads Wiki under Taylor's
[01:30:17.960 --> 01:30:25.500]   Investing Gems, and in my post on the Bogleheads, I did quote you several times, and I really
[01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:27.620]   liked those quotes.
[01:30:27.620 --> 01:30:33.980]   The first one was, "The biggest impediment to my getting started was that I had no confidence
[01:30:33.980 --> 01:30:41.060]   in myself as an investor," and I see that even in young people, in people in college
[01:30:41.060 --> 01:30:50.260]   and just out of college, their first jobs, having no confidence as an investor, not just
[01:30:50.260 --> 01:30:59.380]   elderly people or not just people who have now for some reason have come in to be in
[01:30:59.380 --> 01:31:02.980]   charge of their family finances like you were.
[01:31:02.980 --> 01:31:08.900]   It takes a while to get used to investing, and there's this feeling that it must be something
[01:31:08.900 --> 01:31:15.380]   special that only certain people know how to do it, and the average person cannot do
[01:31:15.380 --> 01:31:16.380]   it.
[01:31:16.380 --> 01:31:23.980]   It's nice for, well, Jack Bogle, of course, revolutionized that, and his books tell us,
[01:31:23.980 --> 01:31:29.860]   "Yes, you can do it," and the Bogleheads tell us, "Yes, you can do it."
[01:31:29.860 --> 01:31:37.700]   Well, Miriam, I think you were not here when I said that I now have this elevator speech
[01:31:37.700 --> 01:31:46.060]   when I meet young people, and I say to them, "It's as easy as buying a cup of coffee and
[01:31:46.060 --> 01:31:49.980]   as wonderful as winning the lottery.
[01:31:49.980 --> 01:31:52.540]   You do not need to know any math.
[01:31:52.540 --> 01:32:01.420]   You don't need to know a lot of charts and spend time because Jack Bogle gave us a revolution
[01:32:01.420 --> 01:32:06.860]   in investing," and I tell them it's like the Copernican when I give a PowerPoint.
[01:32:06.860 --> 01:32:13.940]   I talk about the Copernican revolution where we used to think that the sun went around
[01:32:13.940 --> 01:32:21.020]   the earth, and it was very hard to dispel that notion, and today we have to dispel the
[01:32:21.020 --> 01:32:26.460]   notion that investing is difficult because it is not.
[01:32:26.460 --> 01:32:31.420]   Well, you've made great contributions in spreading that message.
[01:32:31.420 --> 01:32:36.580]   We want to thank you for being a part of the Boglehead community, sharing what you have.
[01:32:36.580 --> 01:32:44.100]   Many thanks to the Boglehead community in how it empowers others and how it's not just
[01:32:44.100 --> 01:32:46.340]   educating oneself for oneself.
[01:32:46.340 --> 01:32:49.500]   There's very much of a paying it forward aspect.
[01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:58.340]   People go on to help others well beyond after they themselves know what they need to know.
[01:32:58.340 --> 01:33:04.060]   Everything you've said, I shouldn't say everything, but so much of what you said aligns with the
[01:33:04.060 --> 01:33:08.020]   Boglehead community in a way that we're grateful.
[01:33:08.020 --> 01:33:10.140]   Absent any other comments?
[01:33:10.140 --> 01:33:18.100]   I do have one more comment, and that is even though investing can be easy in that you don't
[01:33:18.100 --> 01:33:31.340]   have to know lots of fancy investing terms, you don't need to know exactly how stocks
[01:33:31.340 --> 01:33:37.580]   work on the stock market, you don't need to know how to buy individual stocks and when
[01:33:37.580 --> 01:33:45.360]   to sell them, it is not necessarily easy in the sense that we always think, "If I did
[01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:51.060]   one more thing, if I did something different, I could probably have a better portfolio and
[01:33:51.060 --> 01:33:52.060]   make more money."
[01:33:52.060 --> 01:33:57.020]   The whole purpose is to make money, although really the purpose is also to invest it and
[01:33:57.020 --> 01:34:04.100]   save it for our retirement because young people won't have pensions, probably.
[01:34:04.100 --> 01:34:07.920]   They have to create their own pension with their 401(k).
[01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:11.140]   How do you do that?
[01:34:11.140 --> 01:34:15.880]   You get this big list of all these mutual funds in your 401(k).
[01:34:15.880 --> 01:34:21.220]   How do you select the ones that you need and how do you select the ones you don't need
[01:34:21.220 --> 01:34:23.900]   or figure out which ones you don't need?
[01:34:23.900 --> 01:34:26.140]   How many do you need?
[01:34:26.140 --> 01:34:28.260]   What are bonds?
[01:34:28.260 --> 01:34:30.940]   Do I need bonds?
[01:34:30.940 --> 01:34:38.300]   It is not necessarily, I would say, easy, but it is not difficult to learn.
[01:34:38.300 --> 01:34:49.140]   We have many Bogleheads who can explain in easy terms, very like Mike Piper in his investing
[01:34:49.140 --> 01:34:50.140]   make simple.
[01:34:50.140 --> 01:34:53.340]   It makes it very simple to understand it.
[01:34:53.340 --> 01:34:58.420]   You can say, "Oh, okay, in my 401(k) I'm just going to select these three funds then," and
[01:34:58.420 --> 01:34:59.420]   then you watch it.
[01:34:59.420 --> 01:35:05.660]   Then you have to get over the idea that if I just added one more fund, I would be better
[01:35:05.660 --> 01:35:06.660]   off.
[01:35:06.660 --> 01:35:11.220]   Then the market goes up or down and then you say, "Well, then I'll change it and I'll add
[01:35:11.220 --> 01:35:13.660]   this fund and I'll take away that fund."
[01:35:13.660 --> 01:35:21.420]   It's also the problem of trying to recreate or tinker with, is what people will call it,
[01:35:21.420 --> 01:35:26.100]   their portfolio, trying to get a better return.
[01:35:26.100 --> 01:35:27.100]   And that is hard.
[01:35:27.100 --> 01:35:32.500]   I agree with you, Miriam, although I'll go back to what Jack said.
[01:35:32.500 --> 01:35:38.500]   You buy three funds, the total stock, the total bond, and the total international, and
[01:35:38.500 --> 01:35:39.780]   you don't tinker.
[01:35:39.780 --> 01:35:42.500]   You don't keep adding and subtracting.
[01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:49.980]   Now maybe that's hard for everyone, but I love that idea of what he said.
[01:35:49.980 --> 01:35:57.220]   I do like the idea of sleep well at night, not constantly be worrying about what decision
[01:35:57.220 --> 01:35:58.440]   you make.
[01:35:58.440 --> 01:36:03.220]   You get your fair share by doing simple investing.
[01:36:03.220 --> 01:36:04.220]   Indeed.
[01:36:04.220 --> 01:36:06.660]   I meant to share this earlier.
[01:36:06.660 --> 01:36:09.980]   There was a comment in the chat about your book, Sylvia.
[01:36:09.980 --> 01:36:15.740]   Someone wrote, "I found the appendices that explained various terms most valuable."
[01:36:15.740 --> 01:36:21.140]   So I wanted to make sure folks heard that comment.
[01:36:21.140 --> 01:36:22.140]   That's good.
[01:36:22.140 --> 01:36:30.900]   I put them in just as more information and put in sections about some of the great leaders
[01:36:30.900 --> 01:36:33.060]   that we have.
[01:36:33.060 --> 01:36:36.380]   I cited Mellon Taylor's book.
[01:36:36.380 --> 01:36:42.420]   Jason Zweig had a really interesting book called The Devil's Dictionary, some of you
[01:36:42.420 --> 01:36:46.980]   know of it, and then about talk on the street.
[01:36:46.980 --> 01:36:47.980]   What are these things?
[01:36:47.980 --> 01:36:52.700]   I mean, Dave never said, I mean, he always said, "Why is it that I'm supposed to sell
[01:36:52.700 --> 01:36:56.620]   my winners and buy my losers?"
[01:36:56.620 --> 01:37:02.500]   And then somebody else would say, "No, you buy your winners and sell your losers."
[01:37:02.500 --> 01:37:07.900]   Well, there's so much like that that if we don't understand it, it sounds confusing and
[01:37:07.900 --> 01:37:14.020]   we're just backing away, but once we understand, it is great.
[01:37:14.020 --> 01:37:16.180]   Understood, yeah.
[01:37:16.180 --> 01:37:24.860]   So some of what you said hints at rebalancing, and I'll share Buffett has said he'd prefer
[01:37:24.860 --> 01:37:29.020]   to water the flowers and cut the weeds.
[01:37:29.020 --> 01:37:33.600]   So there are many takes on that topic.
[01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:37.260]   So absent any other comments, we can close.
[01:37:37.260 --> 01:37:42.740]   Sylvia, I want to reiterate everyone's gratitude and thank you again for being here and sharing
[01:37:42.740 --> 01:37:43.740]   what you did.
[01:37:43.740 --> 01:37:44.740]   Thank you.
[01:37:44.740 --> 01:37:44.740]   Thank you.
[01:37:44.740 --> 01:37:45.740]   Thank you.
[01:37:45.740 --> 01:37:45.740]   Thank you.
[01:37:45.740 --> 01:37:50.740]   Thank you.
[01:37:50.740 --> 01:37:55.740]   Thank you.
[01:37:55.740 --> 01:38:00.740]   Thank you.
[01:38:00.740 --> 01:38:05.740]   Thank you.
[01:38:05.740 --> 01:38:08.320]   (upbeat music)
