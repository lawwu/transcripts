[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.240]   The following excerpt is taken from John Piper's recent sermon, "The Plundering of
[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.920]   Your Property and the Power of Hope," preached at Passion City Church in
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.480]   Atlanta, Georgia on January 18th. The sermon was based on Hebrews chapter 10
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:27.840]   verses 32 to 36. Here's what John Piper said. "The church in America, as I at age
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:39.200]   69 have watched her now for a long time, is slowly awakening from the distortion
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:47.920]   of about 350 years of dominance and prosperity in America." Let me say that sentence
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:54.640]   again. Paradigm determining for me. "The church in America," and I'm just thinking
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.880]   right across the board, no particular denomination, Protestant, Roman Catholic,
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:06.640]   Eastern Orthodox. "The church in America today is slowly awakening from the
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:18.560]   distortion of about 350 years," namely the length of our country, "of dominance,"
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:27.920]   distortion of dominance, "and prosperity." What I mean by dominance is that in most
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:35.680]   American history, most of American history until recently, being a Christian has been
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:48.960]   viewed as normal, good, patriotic, culturally acceptable, even beneficial.
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:57.880]   And what I mean by prosperous, 350 years of prosperous, is that by and large,
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:04.120]   being a Christian has generally resulted in things going well for you,
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.040]   especially in the South. I grew up three hours from here in Greenville,
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:13.840]   South Carolina. I'm a Southerner by birth. I grew up in the horrors of some of the
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:22.760]   stuff I'm going to be talking about in a minute. We're Christian in the South.
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:31.800]   We're Americans. And what I mean by distortion, the distortion of 350 years
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:39.320]   of dominance and prosperity, is that this 350-year history of our dominance and
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:45.840]   prosperity has created a massively, deeply unbiblical mindset,
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:57.520]   namely of at-homeness in the world. Hasn't been good for us.
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:08.680]   We are suffering from it, prosperous though we be. So we're dominant culturally
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.960]   and prosperous materially, and we've come to feel at home.
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:20.560]   It's our land, our culture, and the assumption is that it will go well
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.720]   for us here. This is our place. It's the way we do things,
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:35.080]   the way we think about things. We are Christian here, and we very much enjoy
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:42.920]   being thought well of for that, and we expect things to go well.
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:49.760]   And poverty and sickness and suffering and death are the worst things that can
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:57.480]   happen, and there isn't anything much worse. We expect this Christian land to
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.600]   be wealthy, us to be wealthy, us to be healthy, ease, upbeat,
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:08.000]   success-oriented, and we've developed a form of Christianity to support those
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.720]   expectations, ingrained expectations. To be a Christian is to be accepted.
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.960]   To be a Christian is to be comfortable. To be a Christian is to be secure and to
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:27.480]   be prosperous. And that form of Christianity has focused mainly on how we
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.320]   feel and the needs, whether our needs are getting met.
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:36.680]   And then we sell this, we offer this to people, "Come and life will go better
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.440]   for you." By and large, in America for 300 years,
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.800]   the call to be a Christian has not been the call to be an alien.
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.880]   By and large, it hasn't been the call to be a sojourner or an exile or to be
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.920]   out of step. It's the call to be a respected citizen in the community.
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.680]   And we get angry, really angry. Watch it. Watch it. It's still true.
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.320]   We're only slowly awakening from this. People get angry.
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:11.120]   If you treat my Christianity as though it's not the norm, my views of things
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.360]   as not the norm, I get angry. You're taking away my culture.
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:21.920]   You're taking away my land, my history. I'm getting mad at you because I've
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:28.000]   developed a Christianity with assumptions that assume dominance and prosperity and
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.960]   normal and fitting in. This is our way here. You don't like it,
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.640]   go somewhere else.
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:43.160]   There's enough truth in that to give it some traction, right?
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:48.640]   If you live like a Christian, if you don't get drunk every weekend,
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:54.240]   probably you'll be more successful in life, right? You keep your job.
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.680]   Your marriage will probably go better if you don't come home drunk every Sunday
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.800]   night. I mean, that's true. And the Bible says don't get drunk.
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.920]   And so if you do what the Bible says, life goes better.
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:09.360]   The Bible says work hard. You know, if you don't work, don't eat.
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.280]   So if you work hard, then you're probably going to prosper
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.680]   in your business a little more. So be a Christian obviously brings
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.240]   success. There's just enough truth in this that it gets traction.
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.560]   The problem is it's just totally out of proportion.
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:33.240]   We have come to take all those relatively minor spin-offs of devotion to Jesus and
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:39.920]   elevated them above the massive real pleasures of knowing him, loving him,
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:46.120]   and dying and being with him forever. Everything's out of proportion
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:57.800]   in typical American Christianity. This text fills me, it has for so many years,
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:04.920]   with a longing not to be a domesticated, comfort-seeking,
[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:11.120]   entertainment-addicted, prosperity-loving, security-craving,
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:18.760]   approval-desiring Christian. I don't want to be that.
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:23.360]   It's abominable to me to be that. I don't want to waste my life just
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:31.080]   fitting in so low. I want to be set free from this distortion.
[00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:37.480]   I want to be biblical. I want to have real spiritual,
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:46.040]   otherworldly power on my life. I want to have stunningly
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:52.240]   countercultural, otherworldly hope driving this engine.
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.240]   Wow, that clip was from John Piper's recent sermon,
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.800]   "The Plundering of Your Property and the Power of Hope," preached at Passion City
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:03.640]   Church in Atlanta, Georgia on January 18th. The full message is on our site,

[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:43.000]   Tomorrow, we will look at a question from a podcast listener who wants to know if
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.120]   the first sin committed by Adam and Eve undermines Christian hedonism.
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:51.560]   I'm your host Tony Rankia. I'll see you tomorrow.
