[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720]   Something I've been using for years now when I'm running is the Shox Open Run Pro headphones.
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.840]   I mentioned the AirPods earlier. I love them for everything except running. I love that these
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.400]   Shox headphones are open ear so you can hear things around you, cars coming, anything like
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.160]   that. Also, when I'm running, I really like the Nike Slim Waist Pack. I used to use a shoulder
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.440]   band and then my wife got this waist pack and I was like, "Oh, that seems silly." And then I tried
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.640]   it. I was like, "Oh, this is much better." And so you can't see your phone while you're running,
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.720]   but let's be real, using your phone while it's on one of those shoulder bands while you're running
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.920]   is not really possible either. I've really enjoyed switching to this. I wear it on the front. She
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.920]   likes it on the back, but great thing for running. Along the lines of running, the Nike Vaporfly 3
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.360]   shoes are fantastic race day shoes. My speed actually improved pretty noticeably using them,
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:55.040]   but they're not everyday shoes. And so when it came to running, I switched to the Nike Pegasus
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.800]   41 shoes, which I could totally customize online.
