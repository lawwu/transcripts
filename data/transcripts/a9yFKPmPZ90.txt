[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.360]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.260]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.240]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.580]   Today, my guest is Ido Portal.
[00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.880]   Ido Portal is somebody who truly defies formal definition.
[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.780]   He is, however, credited by many
[00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.260]   to be the world expert in all things movement.
[00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.060]   Movement is one of the more fascinating
[00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.460]   and important aspects of our nervous system.
[00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.680]   In fact, it was the great Nobel Prize winner Sherrington
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.380]   that said, "Movement is the final common path."
[00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.760]   And what he was referring to is the fact
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.020]   that so much of our nervous system is dedicated to movement,
[00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.660]   and in particular, that the human nervous system
[00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.260]   can generate the greatest variety of forms of movement.
[00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.240]   We can run, we can jump, we can crawl,
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.000]   we can move at different speeds.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.360]   Far more variation in movement
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.140]   and different types and speeds of movement
[00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.640]   than any other animal in the animal kingdom can perform.
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.800]   My interest in bringing Ido Portal onto this podcast
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.900]   stemmed from a discussion about just that,
[00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.740]   about Sherrington and the enormous range of movements
[00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.200]   that humans can engage in.
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.480]   Ido is both a practitioner and an intellectual.
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.920]   We all know what a practitioner is.
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.260]   It's somebody who walks the walk,
[00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.220]   who actually performs the thing
[00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.300]   that they are knowledgeable about.
[00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.260]   And indeed, Ido has studied capoeira,
[00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.140]   a number of other martial arts, dance, gymnastics,
[00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.460]   various forms of sport.
[00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.220]   He's trained top athletes like Conor McGregor,
[00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.720]   and he has many, many other credits to his name
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.100]   as a practitioner and teacher.
[00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.900]   However, he is also a true intellectual of movement.
[00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.100]   I define an intellectual as somebody
[00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.300]   who can both think about and talk about a subject
[00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.380]   at multiple levels of granularity,
[00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.700]   that is with exquisite detail and with exquisite simplicity,
[00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.940]   depending on their audience
[00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.580]   and depending on the topic at hand.
[00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.240]   And as you'll soon hear from my discussion with Ido,
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.360]   he is both a practitioner
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.500]   and a true intellectual of all things movement.
[00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.060]   Today, through our discussion,
[00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.080]   you will learn how the nervous system generates movement
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.460]   and the different forms of movement,
[00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.980]   the different speeds of movement.
[00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:11.180]   You're also going to get an incredible insight
[00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.380]   through Ido's mind and eyes
[00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.660]   of how movement can serve us in the various contexts of life,
[00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.460]   not just in sport, not just in exercise,
[00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.780]   but in every aspect of our lives
[00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.200]   from the time we get up in the morning
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.140]   until the time we go to sleep at night,
[00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.940]   how we engage with others, how we engage with ourselves,
[00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.840]   indeed, how movement even informs relationships
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.500]   of different kinds.
[00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.620]   I found our discussion to be one of the most enlightening
[00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.720]   and interesting discussions that I've ever had,
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.100]   not just about movement, but about the nervous system.
[00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.460]   I can assure you that by the end of this episode,
[00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.820]   you will not only learn a tremendous amount about movement
[00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.340]   through the eyes and mind of the one and only Ido Portal,
[00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.940]   but you also will learn a tremendous amount of neuroscience
[00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.260]   about how the cells and circuits and hormones
[00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.720]   and neurotransmitters of your body assist in creating
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.000]   the various forms of movement that you can generate,
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.020]   that you're trying to learn and generate,
[00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.220]   and that perhaps you should think about
[00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.860]   trying to learn and generate.
[00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.820]   And indeed, you'll learn some protocols and tools
[00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:11.980]   for how to do that.
[00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.780]   In science, we have a phrase, actually it's a title,
[00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.300]   that's reserved for only the rarest of individuals.
[00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.980]   We say that somebody is an N of one,
[00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.900]   meaning a sample size of one.
[00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.340]   And as you'll soon learn, Ido Portal is truly an N of one.
[00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.860]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.460]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.380]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.820]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.340]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.380]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.060]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.260]   Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.
[00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.580]   Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin mineral
[00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.500]   probiotic drink that also has adaptogens and digestive enzymes.
[00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.420]   I started taking Athletic Greens way back in 2012,
[00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.660]   and so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:57.580]   In fact, when people ask me
[00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.740]   what's the one supplement they should take,
[00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.100]   I always say Athletic Greens,
[00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.540]   because it covers all of those essential nutritional bases,
[00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.820]   and the probiotics, adaptogens, and digestive enzymes
[00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.940]   are vital for things like the gut microbiome.
[00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.400]   Your gut microbiome is trillions of little microbacteria
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.620]   that live in your gut and that support your immune system,
[00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.280]   your endocrine system, and the so-called gut-brain axis,
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.940]   which is important for mood and neurotransmitter production,
[00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.540]   a huge number of biological systems in your brain and body.
[00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:25.980]   Athletic Greens also tastes great.
[00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:27.300]   I mix mine with water,
[00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.500]   and I like a little bit of lemon juice or lime juice in there.
[00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.240]   As I mentioned, I drink it twice a day,
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.640]   usually once in the morning,
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.980]   during the phase of the day in which typically I'm fasting
[00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.060]   or around breakfast time,
[00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.340]   and then again in the afternoon or even in the evening.
[00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.620]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.300]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.740]   to claim a special offer.
[00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.420]   They'll give you five free travel packs,
[00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.600]   which make it very easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.180]   while you're on the road,
[00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.660]   and they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3, K2.
[00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.580]   Vitamin D3 and K2 are important for endocrine health,
[00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.300]   for cardiovascular health, for calcium regulation,
[00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:00.180]   and so on.
[00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.780]   Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.360]   to claim this special offer.
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.020]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Roca.
[00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.880]   Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.500]   that are of the absolute highest quality and practicality.
[00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.580]   I've spent a lifetime working on the visual system,
[00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.580]   and I can tell you that your visual system has to contend
[00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.020]   with an enormous number of challenges.
[00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.960]   For instance, when you move from a shady area
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.780]   to a bright area, your eyes have to adapt to that.
[00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.620]   Roca understands the various challenges
[00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.000]   that the visual system has to face,
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.380]   and they've developed sunglasses and eyeglasses
[00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.780]   with all of that biology in mind.
[00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.100]   Their glasses were developed by two All-American swimmers
[00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.500]   from Stanford, and initially, Roca sunglasses and eyeglasses
[00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.220]   were for athletes.
[00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.900]   They designed eyeglasses that then and still now
[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.420]   will stay on your face if you get sweaty,
[00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:43.420]   you can wear them running,
[00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:44.820]   you can wear them cycling, et cetera.
[00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.580]   They're very lightweight, so lightweight, in fact,
[00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:47.740]   that most of the time you don't even remember
[00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.080]   that they're on your face.
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.720]   But Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.260]   also come in a terrific aesthetic,
[00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.400]   so you can wear them anywhere.
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.540]   So unlike a lot of so-called performance glasses out there
[00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.260]   that make people look like cyborgs,
[00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.180]   you can wear Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses when exercising,
[00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:01.780]   to dinner, to work.
[00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:03.580]   Again, the aesthetics are really terrific
[00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.900]   and really adaptable to all those different environments.
[00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.420]   If you'd like to try Roca glasses,
[00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:10.140]   you can go to Roca, that's R-O-K-A.com,
[00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:13.540]   and enter the code Huberman to get 20% off your first order.
[00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.460]   Again, that's R-O-K-A.com,
[00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.560]   enter the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.180]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.
[00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.360]   Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.220]   that are customized to your sleep needs.
[00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.880]   I've talked a lot on this podcast and on other podcasts
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.760]   and on social media about the essential need for sleep.
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.700]   Put simply, sleep is the foundation of all mental health,
[00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.720]   physical health, and performance.
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.820]   Just a few nights or even one night's poor sleep
[00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:39.580]   can really hinder your mental health,
[00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:43.100]   physical health, and performance in all aspects of life.
[00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.980]   Helix has customized sleep products,
[00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:47.640]   that is mattresses and pillows
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.340]   that are designed to your sleep needs.
[00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:50.700]   And you can figure out what those sleep needs
[00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.060]   are very easily by going to the Helix website.
[00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.060]   They have a quiz that takes just about two minutes
[00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:56.240]   and asks you questions like,
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.100]   do you sleep on your back, your side, or your stomach?
[00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:00.540]   Do you tend to run hot or cold during sleep, et cetera?
[00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:01.380]   Or maybe you don't even know
[00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:02.980]   the answers to those questions, that's fine too.
[00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:05.980]   That's an option that you can answer as well.
[00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:07.500]   You take the brief two minute quiz
[00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.400]   and then Helix will match you to the ideal mattress
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.480]   and pillow for you.
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:14.180]   I matched to the so-called dusk mattress.
[00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:16.380]   I started sleeping on that well over a year ago now
[00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:17.880]   and it's the best sleep I've ever had.
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:21.460]   I'm sleeping much longer and much better
[00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:22.560]   through the entire night.
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.300]   And as a consequence, I'm feeling much better,
[00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.620]   more clear, more physically alert, et cetera,
[00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:27.780]   throughout the day.
[00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.380]   If you're interested in upgrading your mattress,

[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.260]   for up to $200 off and two free pillows.
[00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.560]   And now for my discussion with Ido Portal.
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.740]   Ido, thank you for coming here today.
[00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:53.460]   I've been looking forward to sitting down with you
[00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.760]   to talk for a very long time.
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.660]   I was first exposed to your work,
[00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:02.160]   my post or a podcast, I believe,
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:06.260]   of you had a group of people walking down handrails,
[00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.220]   literally the handrails along stairwells.
[00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:11.020]   And as a, I don't want to say former skateboarder,
[00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:13.060]   once a skateboarder, always a skateboarder.
[00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:16.620]   As a skateboarder, handrails have a particular meaning,
[00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:20.000]   but I was really struck by, first of all,
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.260]   the incredible range of skill that people had
[00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.740]   and yet their willingness to do this, right?
[00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:29.800]   I think of handrails and walking on handrails
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.220]   or skateboarding and handrails as a potential hazard.
[00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:35.380]   And yet some of the incredible proficiency
[00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:37.500]   that some of the people there, including yourself, had.
[00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:40.300]   So like many people, I was drawn to your practice
[00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:43.500]   and your work initially through a wide-eyed, wow,
[00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:46.260]   they're doing some incredible stuff on natural objects,
[00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.100]   much as skateboarders or parkour folks do.
[00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:52.160]   But over the years, we've been in communication
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.600]   and I've come to realize that you're a true intellectual
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.320]   of the topic of movement.
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.080]   And I define an intellectual as somebody
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.660]   who can understand a topic
[00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:02.940]   at multiple levels of granularity,
[00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:06.540]   detail, general, specific, connections, et cetera.
[00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:11.200]   So to start off, could you share with us
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:15.340]   your conception of this idea of movement?
[00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:20.840]   Obviously movement involves translation through space,
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.860]   but when you talk about a movement practice,
[00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:25.700]   what are you really thinking about?
[00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:26.780]   What are we talking about
[00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:29.080]   when we talk about a movement practice?
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:33.180]   - It's a big question.
[00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:38.840]   I somehow left the definition,
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:43.840]   the very tight definition of it out for myself
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:46.360]   because I felt it was starting to constrict me
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:47.200]   and be around me
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.920]   and I let the practice itself really define it.
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:55.920]   But I think part of our sense of everything
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:58.300]   is actually a sense of movement
[00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:02.340]   and then the stillness in the background of that.
[00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:06.520]   So for me, this is the entity that I refer to as movement
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:11.520]   and using that perspective for self-evolution, development,
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:14.560]   of course, the physical side,
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:17.600]   but also movement of emotions, movement of thoughts,
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:21.780]   and any other movement streams.
[00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:24.180]   And by switching these layers
[00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:26.200]   and examining it from different places,
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.340]   you get a better and better sense of it.
[00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:32.540]   I think the visuals nowadays and media
[00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:36.200]   are what defines for people in the beginning things
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.080]   and then little by little with experience,
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.240]   they can dive deeper, which is good.
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:45.040]   There is some aspects, sexy aspects or not so sexy aspects,
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:48.200]   and then you pull on it and you start to examine
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:52.380]   and dive deeper and then you receive the gift
[00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.960]   of finding out more.
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:58.540]   - I heard you say once that we are not just a brain
[00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:02.040]   with a body, but we are a body with a brain,
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:05.240]   which I absolutely love because as a student
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.360]   and a researcher of the nervous system,
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:10.720]   I never think about the brain as its own isolated thing.
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.040]   I think about the nervous system and the fact that the brain
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.780]   and the spinal cord are connected to the body
[00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:18.080]   and the body is connected to the brain.
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:21.960]   In every direction, everything truly is connected
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:24.960]   at the physical level, physiological level.
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.800]   Could you just share for a moment
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:29.400]   how you think about this body-brain relationship
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:34.320]   in terms of, you mentioned movement of emotions,
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.560]   movement of the body,
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.900]   that you can't really separate the two.
[00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:40.940]   And for the typical person who's listening to this,
[00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:44.040]   they might not immediately understand what that means.
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:45.980]   Maybe it's something that has to be experienced,
[00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:49.600]   but when we think about the body and the brain
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.400]   and the whole thing working as one cohesive whole,
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:54.440]   what does that mean to you?
[00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:58.520]   Or put simply, when you do a movement practice,
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:11:59.800]   what are you focusing on?
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.980]   Are you focusing on the movement of your limbs?
[00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:03.140]   I have to imagine that's true,
[00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:05.560]   but are you also focusing on how that makes you feel
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:07.940]   or how your feelings make you move?
[00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:09.780]   - Okay.
[00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:13.100]   Okay, so some thoughts.
[00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:16.880]   I will try not to answer any of your questions
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:17.960]   during this interview,
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.360]   but I will definitely give some thoughts
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:21.920]   and then we can play with it.
[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:27.800]   I think these definitions,
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:30.800]   and in general, the limitation of words,
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:35.800]   ends up creating some kind of a corruptive process.
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:41.880]   The words corrupt us and corrupt our understanding.
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:43.420]   So I think the brain, body,
[00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:46.680]   this Cartesian state of mind and thinking,
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.680]   brought a lot of good,
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.080]   but also brought a lot of problems.
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.360]   And movement for me is the entity
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:56.500]   that ties everything together.
[00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:57.720]   It's the magic.
[00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:00.240]   It's the forza anima.
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:02.960]   It's when the coin spins
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:06.240]   and you see both sides appear at the same time.
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:09.240]   It's a beautiful analogy from a friend of mine,
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.560]   Dr. Rasmus Olme.
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:16.480]   So the mind and body are one of those pairs,
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:19.640]   and I call it the movement-body-mind system.
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:23.640]   When it's integrated, it's in motion.
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:26.980]   There is also a stillness that appears there, of course.
[00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:28.820]   Without it, there can be no motion,
[00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:33.820]   but maybe that is a very good way
[00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:35.280]   to start to think of things.
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:38.200]   There is no really pure mental processes,
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.320]   cognitive processes.
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:41.420]   There is no pure physical processes.
[00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:44.280]   Everything touches everything.
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:47.360]   There is a wholeness, and that wholeness is in motion.
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:53.860]   Yeah, the movement practice takes these bits
[00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:58.200]   and examines them, and here is a pragmatic thing.
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:02.660]   The scientist, the cerebral thinking about movement.
[00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:05.720]   This is important.
[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.540]   The emotional side.
[00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:12.480]   Coloring, feeling the colors and the textures of motion.
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:15.000]   A lot of people who are involved with a movement practice
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.400]   never end up feeling motions,
[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.840]   really focusing on how it makes you feel
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:22.060]   or how it feels itself.
[00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:24.520]   And then the actual movement, the action.
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:27.480]   So it's action, emotion, and thought.
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.680]   And those are three streams of movement,
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:31.040]   and they interlace together
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:36.040]   into this kind of braided experience and whole experience.
[00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:40.360]   And I try to bring all these aspects into my practice
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:41.920]   and the way that I live my life.
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:47.920]   - I think most people who embark on a movement practice
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:52.520]   will first want to know which movements to do, right?
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:57.520]   Squats, planks, pushups, pirouettes, right?
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:01.280]   Pick your movement, it could be any movement.
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:05.860]   Are there any sort of just basic entry points
[00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:09.180]   that you believe everybody should walk through
[00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:10.760]   as they embrace a movement practice?
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:12.860]   The first time and maybe even every time
[00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:14.360]   they do a movement practice.
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:17.600]   I mean, earlier today I had the great privilege
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:21.520]   of being guided through a long series of movement practices.
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:23.840]   And yet the first practice we did involved,
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:27.320]   at first anyway, stillness, not movement.
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:30.880]   So if you would, could you inform us
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:32.960]   how people should think about approaching
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:34.960]   a movement practice?
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:39.960]   What is the first layer of any good movement practice?
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:42.000]   - So you touch the word movements
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.420]   and it's important for me to separate it
[00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:47.500]   from the word movement with a capital M.
[00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:53.440]   Movements are the containers and movement is the content.
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:56.000]   And the content cannot be carried
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.520]   in any way without containers.
[00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:01.760]   So the first entry point is to choose containers.
[00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:03.840]   And then the second thing to make sure
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:08.440]   is to put specific content into those containers
[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:10.480]   and then enjoy them.
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:12.960]   I tell people that it's like a cup of water
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:14.640]   and you're being handed that cup of water
[00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:17.800]   and nowadays, very often, people will start
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:20.920]   to chew on the cup instead of drinking the water,
[00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:23.420]   making it yours, discard the cup.
[00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:26.540]   And then maybe later you want to have bone broth or soup,
[00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:29.400]   so you use a different container, a bowl.
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:32.500]   So a movement practice can start from anywhere.
[00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:36.280]   It's a rhizome, it's an open system,
[00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:38.720]   it has no center, it's decentralized
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.800]   and it can be approached from anywhere
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:45.400]   and that's its magic and that's the benefit of it.
[00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:49.520]   Some people find the body a good entry point.
[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:51.880]   Some people don't even enter from the body.
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:55.800]   Sometimes you can enter from other perspectives
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:57.840]   and then inside the body, for example,
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:00.080]   where should we enter if we decided
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:01.800]   to take the body approach?
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:03.600]   The spine can be a nice decision
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.540]   but some will choose just the pelvis.
[00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:09.500]   Any one of those points are valid
[00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:11.960]   and then playfulness can be an entry point,
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:15.160]   an attribute or, and this is so open.
[00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:19.640]   So I don't want to limit people and limit their minds
[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.560]   in the way that they engage with a practice
[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:26.560]   but I also want to encourage the self-inquiry,
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:29.400]   am I doing movements practice
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:32.220]   or am I doing a movement practice?
[00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:34.040]   - So could you help me distinguish the two
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:34.880]   a little bit further?
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:36.060]   I think I understand the difference
[00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:39.280]   between a sort of the noun versus the verbs
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:42.660]   and in some ways here we are dealing with the challenge
[00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:45.720]   of the barriers that language present
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:47.000]   to something that's physical, right?
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.460]   I mean, indeed, there may not be a,
[00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:54.840]   I have to assume there is no perfect verbal language
[00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:55.680]   for movement.
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:57.600]   There are certain movements that defy language.
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:01.100]   I could say somebody jumped at a particular trajectory
[00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:03.440]   at a particular speed and moved this limb and that limb
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:07.680]   but by fractionating it, something is most definitely lost.
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:11.040]   So if someone wanted to, let's say,
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:14.060]   get in better touch with their body, in quotes,
[00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:18.720]   in order to explore the infinite space that is movement,
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:21.560]   how might they begin to approach that?
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:23.820]   Is it, does it begin with an awareness,
[00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:25.880]   with practice or both?
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:27.760]   - It begins with education
[00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:31.580]   and that's probably the most stable point of entry,
[00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:35.020]   awareness to something as a concept,
[00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:38.520]   that it is a concept, that there is a validity
[00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:41.460]   or because sometimes people look for that
[00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:45.660]   to looking at this entity, this open entity
[00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:49.380]   and that's part of the reason why answering questions
[00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:54.380]   is not something I can do or even attempt to do.
[00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:59.960]   I believe in the power of the non-complete process,
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:04.960]   like making this table but leaving something undone,
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:07.640]   not perfecting the product.
[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:08.480]   Why?
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:11.760]   Because it offers some kind of a dynamic nature of evolution
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:14.060]   that naturally unravels from it.
[00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:19.720]   Almost like sometimes I do it,
[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:22.720]   I count reps and I'll only count to nine
[00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:26.880]   because it tends to leave people in the count
[00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:29.760]   and it keeps going instead of giving them the 10.
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:31.440]   - Everyone wants to end on 10.
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:36.000]   - Yeah, which is because of the decimal system, et cetera.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.120]   So, all kinds of things like that is also important
[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:43.480]   with the movement idea is to discuss, to examine,
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:46.040]   to look, to taste, to try
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:47.840]   but then also not to try to capture
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:51.360]   because if you like the invisible loop of Hofstätter,
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:54.480]   if you look at it too closely, it's gone
[00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:57.240]   but if you look away, it functions
[00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:59.680]   and exists just like us very powerfully
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:04.680]   and obviously gives us the experiences that we have.
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:07.840]   So, when people enter movement practice,
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:09.760]   it is about education,
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:11.480]   bringing some awareness to the fact
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:14.560]   that they are living in a body,
[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:16.560]   that they are living in motion,
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:19.460]   that their mind is a type of movement,
[00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:22.280]   that their life is a type of movement,
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:26.360]   bringing attention to the movement of the emotions as well,
[00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:28.320]   bringing just attention to the fact
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:30.240]   that things are in motion,
[00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:36.340]   the euracletus pantare, all in flux.
[00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:42.360]   Nothing stops besides something that is the background of it
[00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:46.200]   and allows it to express and this is the beauty of things
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:48.960]   and this for me is the movement practice,
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:52.680]   is this examination and bringing this awareness into things.
[00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:56.320]   As we see it now here, I'm also aware of my body.
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:21:01.140]   I'm also aware of the way that things make me feel,
[00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:04.040]   the way that your face is communicating to me
[00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:07.560]   and I'm not just in some limited
[00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:11.380]   and very verbal, overly verbal state
[00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:14.100]   because it misses a lot of the beautiful flux.
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:18.920]   I'm going to inject some or project some ideas
[00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:22.760]   and perhaps you would tell me if they're ridiculous,
[00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:25.460]   potentially useful or useful.
[00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:29.120]   As I understand what we're talking about now
[00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:32.080]   and what we've discussed earlier is that movement
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:36.000]   can and should be incorporated into one's entire life.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.160]   I've even heard you say that even before getting out of bed
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:40.820]   in the morning, one can experience movement
[00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:43.120]   and it doesn't necessarily have to be of the intimate kind
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:46.480]   with somebody else, it can be paying attention
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:49.240]   to the rhythm of one's breath or how you get out of the bed
[00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:52.360]   or actually in anticipation of you arriving here today,
[00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:54.480]   I noticed that as I was going up and down the stairs
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:59.240]   in this house, that I was injecting a little bit
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:01.200]   of playfulness in the way that I might have
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:04.800]   many, many decades ago but haven't for a very long time
[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:08.340]   and I asked myself whether or not that's what Ido
[00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:11.240]   is referring to when he talks about threading
[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:15.480]   this body awareness throughout the day as opposed to,
[00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:17.560]   but of course not exclusive from just saying,
[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:21.040]   I have 45 minutes, I'm going to do movement practice
[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:23.100]   before I shower and have some dinner, right?
[00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:25.440]   I have to imagine both are helpful but in terms of moving
[00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.640]   through the day and having bodily awareness,
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:30.400]   clearly there are an infinite number of ways
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:32.520]   one could do that, maybe you could just share a few.
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:35.040]   You mentioned, I mean, one could pay attention
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:37.880]   to their breath, could pay attention to posture
[00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:40.560]   and this notion of play is a very attractive
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:43.120]   or as we say in science, it's a sticky concept,
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:45.560]   a concept that kind of draws one in.
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:47.520]   Maybe if you would, could you share with us
[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:49.500]   just some ideas to get people thinking about
[00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:51.900]   or maybe even incorporating movement practice
[00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:56.640]   into their day and maybe even touch on the potential role
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:58.280]   of play or playfulness.
[00:22:58.280 --> 00:22:59.120]   - Okay.
[00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:04.980]   Yeah, those are some good directions.
[00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:09.400]   I think one thing is this what you call wordlessness.
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:14.240]   I have been recommending to people nonverbal experiences
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:18.040]   and the awareness of the body which is not really
[00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:20.760]   the awareness of the body as you know,
[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:25.520]   not purely or not fully, the awareness of motion
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:30.080]   is a very good way to start, to bring awareness
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:33.360]   to that layer and that layer will start to get clarified
[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:35.680]   more and more and more the more you practice
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:39.300]   and then it will enable for most people a safe haven,
[00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:42.000]   away from many states and difficulties
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   and will unlock a lot of potential attributes
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:51.360]   and strengths and freshness and a lot of beautiful things.
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:56.800]   Really one of the pretty perspectives about who we are
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:00.120]   comes from a person who influenced my thinking
[00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:03.000]   a lot, Moshe Feldenkrais, the late Moshe Feldenkrais
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.080]   and he talks about the body as the core three elements,
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:08.460]   the core nervous system.
[00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:14.460]   Two is the mechanical system of muscle, skeleton, et cetera
[00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:17.280]   and the third is the environment
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:20.240]   which is a unique way to look at it
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:22.080]   and he talks about how the nervous system
[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:26.320]   is both receiving information from the outside
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:29.140]   and from the inside and in the first years of life,
[00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:34.140]   you work a lot on differentiating what is me
[00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:38.340]   and what is not me and I think movement,
[00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:42.240]   when you feel movement, you feel the movement of the outside
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:45.440]   that is, of course, arriving to you and receiving this
[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:47.400]   and also your own internal movement
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:49.740]   and the same can be said for stillness.
[00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:54.360]   So, bringing the attention into those layers,
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:55.560]   it's a tricky thing.
[00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:58.840]   It's one of those elusive things to look at
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:02.760]   but it's definitely of huge benefit to start to train it,
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:07.600]   start to practice it, to feel not our thoughts,
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:12.600]   not necessarily our body but to start to recognize
[00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:15.920]   the dynamic nature, the flux, the motion
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:18.560]   and it occurs in all these layers.
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:22.840]   So, you will need to find it in multiple locations
[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:27.240]   before you start to more and more make it your own,
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:28.560]   make it really yours.
[00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:33.460]   How, for example, simple pragmatic things.
[00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:36.280]   I used to do this, I spent some time in Hong Kong
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.480]   and I would need to get my practice in
[00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:43.680]   but I'm really turned off from commercial gyms
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:46.720]   and there is not a lot of nature accessible there
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:48.900]   so I would just strap on my bag
[00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:50.920]   and I would walk the streets of Hong Kong
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:52.320]   which are very crowded
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:55.720]   and then I would try to avoid touching anyone
[00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:59.100]   and it would be like two hours of just like moving,
[00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:01.480]   involved, fully involved, fully in my body
[00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:04.400]   and experiencing beautiful things
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:06.980]   and enjoying and developing myself as well.
[00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:08.980]   In all kinds of scenarios, up and down
[00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:11.560]   and in the escalators and off.
[00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:16.560]   So, this is an example of a way to practice
[00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:20.400]   and then the way that we're sitting, like these chairs,
[00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:22.960]   for example, our chairs are not very dynamic
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:24.440]   but there is rocking chairs, right?
[00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:27.800]   And this is something I recommend for a lot of kids.
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:30.920]   Like in schools, I used to rock on the chair
[00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:32.320]   which is very common.
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:34.160]   - Yeah, I used to have my skateboard underneath my chair
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:35.200]   and roll it back and forth
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:37.580]   and the teacher would tell me to stop
[00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:39.080]   and just slowly, little by little,
[00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:40.700]   trying to get the most subtle movement I could
[00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:43.700]   without them telling me they were gonna take it away.
[00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:44.540]   Or try.
[00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:48.620]   - Which is probably horrible, horrible advice and instruction
[00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:51.800]   just like sit up straight and chew with your mouth closed
[00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:56.200]   because they remove a lot of the self-education
[00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:57.760]   and a lot of the self-development
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:00.440]   and the practicum and discoveries that are necessary
[00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:05.440]   and even will damage focus and thinking processes
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:07.360]   in some ways.
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:12.880]   So, for example, I would make the chairs even more mobile
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:17.000]   and I would support more motion
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.200]   and then I would be able to bring attention there
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:22.260]   but I would also be able to bring attention away from it
[00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:26.280]   into other things and it keeps refreshing me
[00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:29.240]   so I don't become stale, the water doesn't stand.
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:30.880]   This is the beauty of movement.
[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:33.320]   So you can focus for long periods of time
[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:35.760]   and do incredible things with the mind, with focus,
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:40.280]   with awareness, attention, and it's with skin in the game.
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:43.000]   So I'm not talking as some meditator
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.640]   and he's describing the act of being very focused
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:49.320]   but then I put a stick on the edge of his fingers
[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:51.080]   and I tell him, "Balance it."
[00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:52.840]   Everyone can do it for 10 seconds
[00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:55.560]   and I tell him, "Okay, now hold it 10 minutes."
[00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:59.840]   And you see that the skill has, he has no skin in the game.
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:02.880]   It wasn't developed in various scenarios
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:05.540]   but so there is a delusion that start to develop.
[00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:11.200]   And that's how movement keeps me very honest
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:14.840]   and humble in the way that I view humility
[00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:19.840]   and in a way that protects me and keeps me fresh.
[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:27.800]   - I love the example of moving through the crowded street
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:29.440]   with a backpack because of the way in which
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:31.760]   it's completely adaptive to the situation
[00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:33.800]   you happen to be in and highlights the fact
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:38.800]   that one doesn't need a gym or any specific scenario,
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:41.240]   although we will certainly touch
[00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:43.800]   on ideal learning circumstances for movement
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:47.600]   and some of the work that you're doing, of course.
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:50.480]   - The less of your own personal practice
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:53.560]   and understanding and knowledge you've done,
[00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:55.040]   the more toys you need.
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:59.180]   The more you've really worked on yourself,
[00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:01.800]   the more high-tech you are.
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:03.800]   The more low-tech are your tools,
[00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:05.280]   the more high-tech you are.
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:08.720]   And this is the most advanced technology
[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:12.000]   by far on this planet with all the advancement.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.840]   It doesn't even start to scratch and you know it
[00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:17.600]   from the way that we understand the eyes
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:21.680]   all the way to, with all due respect to the Boston Robotics,
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:28.080]   five-year-old motion movements or animal motion
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:33.000]   was very underdeveloped still relatively to us systems.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   So important to remind ourselves.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.080]   - A lot can be done with the body and gravity.
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:42.320]   - Floor, a piece of floor, a piece of wall,
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:45.560]   a corner of a room is a beautiful scenario
[00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:50.160]   which you can become, discover in and play in.
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:53.160]   But we are not so developed.
[00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:55.000]   So we don't see those options.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.920]   And this is something that I try to stimulate
[00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:59.760]   and that's why I made it a point to avoid
[00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:04.760]   any of the big sponsorship and high-tech tools.
[00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:10.000]   And I at one point brought a stick into big conventions
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   or sometimes I use a shirt with holes in it.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.240]   Just like I use shirt as a point to make
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:21.720]   when I'm addressing a crowd to keep things
[00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:24.440]   where it's important.
[00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:27.360]   And it's important, we are important
[00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:30.040]   and our experience is important
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:32.720]   and we have to be very careful.
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:36.360]   These habits and these directions,
[00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:38.680]   they come from many times good intention
[00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:42.080]   but they are the devil many times.
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:46.160]   They turn into the devil just like our technology nowadays
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:48.960]   and what is happening with people, with depression,
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:53.960]   with meaninglessness, also with the body
[00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:57.720]   in various perspectives or even I will also flip it
[00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:02.480]   into high performance sports and their price
[00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:04.680]   because for me this is not a movement practice.
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:07.800]   It erases the person in the center of it.
[00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:12.800]   And then came places like skateboarding or breakdancing
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:16.280]   where somebody with a disability becomes the best
[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:19.160]   in the world, turns it into the biggest advantage
[00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:22.320]   but you would never be accepted into gymnastics class
[00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:23.880]   and I love that.
[00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:27.560]   And that change, to place change in the center,
[00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:31.160]   it's important.
[00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:33.820]   - You touched on mention of a few sports.
[00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:37.960]   Maybe it was Charles Polquin or maybe it was another trainer
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:42.640]   that I heard once say that for kids,
[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:44.280]   one of the worst things they can do
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:47.360]   is over-specialize in a particular sport.
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:51.520]   The idea being that it leads to improvements in performance
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:55.400]   in a very narrow domain but they raised the idea
[00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:59.400]   that it perhaps also constrains the development
[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:03.080]   of the nervous system such that certain emotional states,
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:06.240]   certain intellectual abilities will forever be shut off
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:09.160]   because of the intense plasticity that occurs early in life.
[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:12.360]   The more I learn from you, the more I'm thinking
[00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:14.160]   that that statement really should be extended
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:15.360]   to all of life.
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:18.120]   And I loved to remind people,
[00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:20.360]   because I started off as a developmental neurobiologist,
[00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:22.240]   that development doesn't start and end.
[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:24.160]   You don't have childhood and adulthood.
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:25.920]   Our life is one long developmental arc
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:28.680]   from birth until death, however long that might be.
[00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:32.780]   So if one is going to be anti-specialist,
[00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:35.680]   maybe even we call that a generalist,
[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:36.680]   what does that look like?
[00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:39.600]   What are the different domains of movement practice?
[00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:44.600]   And as I asked this, I realized I am in serious danger
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:48.280]   of fractionating movement into a list of words
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:52.560]   like strength and speed and explosiveness and suppleness,
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:54.440]   a word that I've heard you use before.
[00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:55.520]   And yet I think for most people,
[00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:58.440]   because we think in words often,
[00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:01.520]   some of those categories can be useful.
[00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:03.600]   So let's say I was going to embark on a movement practice
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:06.920]   or a child was going to embark on a movement practice
[00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:10.880]   either throughout the day or for a dedicated period of time.
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:12.760]   What are the sorts of categories of movement
[00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:14.760]   that I might want to think about?
[00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:17.040]   Ballistic movement, smooth movement,
[00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:19.060]   maybe you could just enrich us
[00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:21.920]   with some of the landscape around that.
[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:26.620]   - Okay, first I'll address the first part that you mentioned.
[00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:31.320]   And I've learned from you about certain changes
[00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:35.280]   in the way that things develop later in life
[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:36.960]   versus earlier in life.
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:38.520]   And you're right, this was something
[00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:40.320]   that Charles Poliquin also mentioned
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:42.920]   and I learned from back in the day as well from him,
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:47.840]   which can seem dark a bit and kind of hopeless,
[00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:52.280]   but then you should go beyond that.
[00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:58.800]   One thing that does seem to appear for me when I look around
[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:05.880]   is the concept of unique postures.
[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:12.160]   And I think this is true for postures of thought,
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:16.100]   emotional postures and movement postures.
[00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:18.740]   Truly, earlier in life,
[00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:21.840]   we are creating these unique postures
[00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:27.720]   and they get into these drawers or like a language, letters.
[00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:34.880]   Later in life, the process moves more towards integration
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:39.160]   of these unique postures into all different organizations.
[00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:41.820]   The beauty of it is that you can use very few postures
[00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:44.260]   to create many possibilities,
[00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:47.580]   just like Leibniz's search for a language
[00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:52.040]   that contain one symbol only versus two,
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:53.200]   which he discovered.
[00:34:56.220 --> 00:35:01.220]   And this is something that is often seen.
[00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:04.960]   Like, you take someone who moves in a certain way
[00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:08.240]   and you teach him all these new sports or techniques,
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:11.500]   but essentially, if you look deeply and you're sensitive,
[00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:14.080]   you see it's the same postures
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:17.080]   that he will have to work with till the end of his life.
[00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:20.620]   The same thinking postures.
[00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:24.300]   And this is really problematic,
[00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:29.300]   where we are not freeing the mind beyond this,
[00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:37.860]   how would I say, a scaffolding of thinking,
[00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:40.360]   and we are actually letting go of the content.
[00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:45.360]   We get more and more focused on the way of thinking
[00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:50.360]   versus the thinking itself,
[00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:54.600]   or habitual ways and forms of thinking,
[00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:58.600]   associative thinking, et cetera, and emotionally the same.
[00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:01.040]   We are constructing these emotional postures,
[00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:03.320]   and then we have to go through the rest of our lives
[00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:05.000]   working with that.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.560]   So, this is the dark side, right?
[00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:11.880]   But of course, there are always possibilities,
[00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:16.880]   both, I think, invading this early system to some extent,
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:21.960]   even if it's 5% or 7% or whatever percent.
[00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:24.900]   And also, on the freeing yourself
[00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:27.840]   of going beyond all postures, period,
[00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:30.940]   working with the postures you have,
[00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:35.280]   but towards a posture-less way of doing things.
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:37.120]   So, this is something interesting
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:40.440]   when people work with movements,
[00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:44.480]   but finally are able to go into movement,
[00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:46.080]   and this magic starts to happen,
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:48.560]   and then the techniques fall apart,
[00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:53.560]   and something appears, and it's a phase change.
[00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:55.840]   It's a transformation.
[00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:59.400]   It's not a, it's a binary moment.
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:00.840]   There is a jump there, for sure,
[00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:03.440]   and it's very rare to see,
[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:06.880]   both in thinking and emotionally and in other ways.
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:08.360]   We have many names for it,
[00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:10.640]   and some talk about enlightenment,
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:13.560]   and some talk about all kinds of processes related to it,
[00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:18.560]   and I think most of them are shadows of the sun,
[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:20.680]   but it's not the sun itself, really.
[00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:25.560]   And then talking about ways of thinking about movement,
[00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:30.000]   this is where I use something I call my slice and dice.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.280]   Because of the problem of using words
[00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:33.820]   and definitions and categories,
[00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:36.680]   I try to create a lot of them,
[00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:39.240]   and I write them on the paper,
[00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:42.280]   and then I crumble them, throw them into the bin,
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:44.900]   and I keep doing it all my life.
[00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:47.920]   The writing them down and the geeking on it
[00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:51.060]   is very important, also very important, to let it go.
[00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:57.080]   I tell people, what you forgot is not the same,
[00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:59.960]   forgetting is not the same as never knowing it.
[00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:03.440]   The crumbling and throwing away is a form of forgetting,
[00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:06.920]   but it leaves some kind of a homeopathic trace behind.
[00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:14.460]   So let's take some slice and dice and try to look at it.
[00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:18.920]   Here is a physical one, contraction, relaxation.
[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:21.880]   That's a spectrum,
[00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:24.880]   and pretty much everything falls on this spectrum.
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:28.480]   Also, in terms of analyzing a person or yourself,
[00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:31.800]   you can tell me if you feel closer to this side
[00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:33.920]   or closer to that side,
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:36.240]   and then it allows you to examine your practices.
[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:40.980]   How many of the practices are moving you towards balance,
[00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:43.040]   and how many are it's your addiction
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:46.160]   of just doing what you're good at versus what you need?
[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:50.260]   Here is another example, physical culture.
[00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:53.920]   So we have the dance, really,
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:58.760]   working with internal concepts and expressing them,
[00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:01.220]   abstract concepts, expression.
[00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:06.000]   Second perspective, the martial concept,
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.720]   but not in the sense of just fighting, but also partnering,
[00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:11.840]   working with another person,
[00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:15.440]   a dynamic entity that is communicating with you.
[00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:17.480]   The third one is, I call the elements,
[00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:19.560]   working with the environment.
[00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:25.860]   The next one is a somatic one, is the internal practice,
[00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:27.920]   and of course, they are all gray zones,
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:31.280]   and another one is object manipulatory,
[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:33.160]   which you can think of it also as the environment,
[00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:36.320]   but it's more small objects, heavy objects,
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:38.000]   many objects, few objects,
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.720]   and then you can look at this way of thinking,
[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:43.760]   and you can say, oh, I have many of my practices
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:45.360]   in this direction, but not,
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:47.800]   and you can draw it for yourself.
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:49.420]   So that's another perspective,
[00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:53.100]   and this way, I use dozens of perspectives,
[00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:56.480]   and with the years, it gives people a sense
[00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:58.920]   of where they wanna go, how they want to do it,
[00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:00.480]   and what they need to address
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:02.900]   versus what they like to address, et cetera.
[00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:03.740]   - Is it helpful?
[00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:04.660]   - Very helpful.
[00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:06.820]   Those different bins are very helpful.
[00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:10.220]   I really appreciate that you mentioned
[00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:12.880]   that people will often practice what they're good at
[00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:14.640]   as opposed to what they need.
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:18.400]   In gym culture, we refer to this
[00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:22.400]   as the guy that always skips leg day person, right?
[00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:23.880]   Big upper body, skinny legs,
[00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:27.320]   or you'll see people that have these enormous thick torsos
[00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:28.600]   and they're bench pressing all day,
[00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:31.520]   but they clearly need to pull on an object
[00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:33.360]   every once in a while to create some balance,
[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:37.640]   but they don't do it because they, for whatever reason,
[00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:39.500]   they have an obsession with moving
[00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:42.000]   greater and greater poundage or something like that,
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:45.780]   which in certain sports like powerlifting,
[00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:47.560]   where aesthetics aren't the goal,
[00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:49.920]   and it's simply to push more weight off one's chest,
[00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:52.220]   you could imagine that there's something beneficial there.
[00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:55.880]   However, I think that it's really important
[00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:59.920]   in intellectual endeavors and in movement endeavors,
[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:02.520]   if I understand correctly, to bring oneself
[00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:05.480]   to a place of real challenge on a regular basis.
[00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:06.720]   In fact, earlier today,
[00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:08.220]   I was in a state of constant challenge
[00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:09.880]   'cause it was all new to me.
[00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:11.600]   And as much as I told myself,
[00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:14.040]   beginner's mind, beginner's mind, beginner's mind,
[00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:17.240]   it's hard, I confess, to not want to do well,
[00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:18.440]   to perform well, right?
[00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:21.640]   And I think that's a natural and healthy thing.
[00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:24.820]   - Not only natural, it is necessary,
[00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:28.440]   but I want you to keep it on that side
[00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:31.320]   and to bring something to balance it.
[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:35.840]   If there is not this challenge, the process will not work.
[00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:37.440]   It has to be this scale,
[00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:40.240]   and you're talking about scales of pain, pleasure,
[00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:42.920]   and this is another scale.
[00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:46.340]   And this discomfort, again, is necessary
[00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:49.900]   and should be recognized as I'm in the right place.
[00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:54.580]   When it becomes too high and I'm unable to resolve
[00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:59.340]   to make any progress, I went overboard.
[00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:03.400]   But when it's not present, I don't do nothing here,
[00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:05.300]   nothing that I'm truly interested in.
[00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:08.380]   I'm just gratifying myself, wankery.
[00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:15.120]   In essence, it's not about searching for the discomfort,
[00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:17.640]   but it's a marker.
[00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:24.840]   And I think the question should be, who am I serving?
[00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:29.660]   'Cause people do not serve themselves, in essence.
[00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:33.800]   They serve part, parts of it,
[00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:37.800]   some kind of a fraction of themselves.
[00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:41.560]   And this separation of oneself from oneself,
[00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:46.000]   and this is also a result of the practice, a good practice.
[00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:51.420]   I think maybe the biggest gift I received from the practice
[00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:56.420]   is I can say, although it will take maybe a certain context,
[00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:59.340]   I am not my friend.
[00:42:59.340 --> 00:43:05.120]   At times I am, but many times I am not my friend.
[00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:07.220]   And by creating this separation,
[00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:12.220]   I can assume a certain stability in the face of everything
[00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:16.360]   all the way up to our own mortality and death,
[00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:19.680]   which is, and maybe beyond, who knows.
[00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:24.160]   - It was a striking moment for me earlier today
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:25.740]   when I was really challenged
[00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:28.940]   with one of the practices we were doing.
[00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:32.320]   And you said, this is exactly what I experienced
[00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:35.180]   this morning, Andrew, that's what you said.
[00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:37.400]   And I couldn't imagine that you were having challenges
[00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:38.940]   doing what I was attempting to do.
[00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:39.920]   And of course you weren't.
[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:41.220]   I believe what you were referring to
[00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:44.540]   is that you had put yourself at that edge earlier in the day
[00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:46.860]   in which you were making failures.
[00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:48.900]   You were failing to execute the way
[00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:51.920]   that you were attempting to execute movement.
[00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:54.340]   I should just, to inject some neuroscience
[00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:57.400]   and neuroplasticity there, I can't help myself.
[00:43:57.400 --> 00:43:59.040]   This is what I do after all.
[00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:01.820]   There are beautiful data in animals and humans
[00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:05.120]   showing that in the seconds and minutes
[00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:09.140]   after a failed attempt at a motor execution of something,
[00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:11.700]   the forebrain is in a heightened state of focus.
[00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:14.380]   And when you hear it, it suddenly makes perfect sense.
[00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:16.700]   Of course, why would the nervous system change
[00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:18.860]   unless it got a cue to change?
[00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:23.280]   And the cue almost always comes in the form of frustration.
[00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:26.700]   The ah, or as we said earlier, nah.
[00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:29.680]   The nah signal is the one that preps you
[00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:33.660]   to extract more learning from the subsequent trials.
[00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:36.380]   And yet for a lot of people, they feel that,
[00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:38.440]   oh, that failure to execute,
[00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:42.060]   or even to approximate execution,
[00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:46.460]   and they feel and experience that ah, negative signal,
[00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:48.980]   and they lean out of the practice.
[00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:52.540]   They start to depart either mentally or physically or both.
[00:44:52.540 --> 00:44:55.860]   And if there's anything I think that perhaps we can offer
[00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:58.320]   is this understanding that that edge, as some people call it,
[00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:01.180]   or that failures aren't just necessary,
[00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:03.720]   they are part of the learning process.
[00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:07.660]   They are the entry gate to neuroplasticity.
[00:45:07.660 --> 00:45:12.260]   Yes, contextualizing or re-contextualizing,
[00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:15.260]   that sensation is something I work a lot with
[00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:16.780]   and I just remind it to people,
[00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:18.980]   and I also remind it to myself.
[00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:20.620]   And if it wasn't difficult
[00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:23.660]   and we didn't need to redo it again and again,
[00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:27.220]   we wouldn't be again on this correct scale,
[00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:31.380]   which is dynamic and moving, just like rolling downhill.
[00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:35.660]   So there is definitely a necessity to succeed, to orient.
[00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:39.180]   There is certain aspects that you want to achieve,
[00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:43.620]   but then there is also the letting go of it
[00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:45.780]   and the de-ambitioning of it.
[00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:49.300]   And within that tension,
[00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:51.440]   the plus and the minus comes movement.
[00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:52.700]   And that's how the,
[00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:55.100]   and again, if I stretch it too far away
[00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:57.460]   or if I increase one of them too much,
[00:45:57.460 --> 00:45:59.060]   then I would have some issues.
[00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:01.660]   But you will, with practice,
[00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:06.660]   learn to recognize the optimal point of progression.
[00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:09.840]   Of course, it takes many years
[00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:14.240]   and a lot of play and exposure to get a sense of it,
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:18.100]   regardless of the layer in which it is applied.
[00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:22.280]   So I'm sure in your field and in your pursuits,
[00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:26.180]   you are already aware of it and applying it in your life,
[00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:27.220]   talking about focus,
[00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:30.940]   talking about ways of thinking, creativity, et cetera.
[00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:34.060]   But then it's enough that I pull into another perspective
[00:46:34.060 --> 00:46:36.420]   and you will see that people are specialists
[00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:40.540]   and then they don't have really the real essence
[00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:42.140]   of the concept.
[00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:43.340]   It's not theirs.
[00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:45.740]   It's applied specifically.
[00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:49.740]   The one who changes all the time gets the general component
[00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:52.580]   because what appears when everything changes,
[00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:54.400]   that is that new entity.
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:58.080]   Everything changes, something stays.
[00:46:58.080 --> 00:46:59.180]   That's what we want to get,
[00:46:59.180 --> 00:47:01.700]   this concept and this understanding.
[00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:04.260]   - I've heard the statement before,
[00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:06.340]   we are just a meat vehicle, right?
[00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:08.420]   We're just a sack of cells.
[00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:12.860]   And I truly despise that statement because first of all,
[00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:16.640]   it deprives us of all meaning of our lives.
[00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:20.100]   And we can go down the route of philosophy
[00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:22.240]   as to whether or not there's meaning or not,
[00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:23.780]   but more importantly,
[00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:26.300]   it divorces us from the idea that the body and brain
[00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:29.980]   are interconnected and have at least equal value
[00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:32.140]   at any one moment, they're informing each other.
[00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:35.760]   Emotions inform movement, movement informs emotions.
[00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:37.700]   One thing that I've heard you say before,
[00:47:37.700 --> 00:47:40.940]   and I really love to hear you embellish on,
[00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:44.440]   is this important principle that human beings
[00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:47.720]   are truly unique in terms of the enormous range
[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:49.460]   of movements that we can perform.
[00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:53.660]   And yet we are excellent, maybe superior
[00:47:53.660 --> 00:47:57.340]   to all other species at certain types of movement.
[00:47:57.340 --> 00:48:00.780]   The one that comes to mind is walking, strides, striding.
[00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:05.480]   So maybe we could just explore that idea
[00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:08.780]   because obviously a cheetah is very fast.
[00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:10.980]   The gibbon seems to have a lot of proficiency
[00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:12.940]   at grabbing and swinging from branches,
[00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:17.380]   but human beings perform an enormous
[00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:19.940]   or can potentially perform an enormous array of movements.
[00:48:19.940 --> 00:48:22.540]   Do you think all human beings are potentially able
[00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:25.820]   to explore all the different types of movement?
[00:48:25.820 --> 00:48:29.660]   And if so, how does one approach that?
[00:48:29.660 --> 00:48:33.100]   So basically what I'm doing is I'm tabling a concept
[00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:35.700]   which is not range of motion, right?
[00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:38.580]   For the gym rats, discard with range of motion.
[00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:42.020]   I'm talking about the variety of movements.
[00:48:42.020 --> 00:48:47.340]   - First, it's not important what I think,
[00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:49.500]   if it's possible or not possible,
[00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:53.540]   or if it's even possible for you or not possible for you,
[00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:58.540]   what is important is what you truly want to do,
[00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:00.460]   what you truly are after.
[00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:02.660]   And it's important for me because many times
[00:49:02.660 --> 00:49:06.700]   this way of thinking about things is already limited.
[00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:12.400]   I like to say a man doesn't go to the ocean
[00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:14.220]   to empty it with a spoon.
[00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:20.340]   A lot of the types of dressing up of the concepts nowadays
[00:49:20.340 --> 00:49:25.100]   is trying to fit an elephant into the hole in the needle.
[00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:29.480]   Like for example, the concept of practice.
[00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:34.540]   And then our lives, as if we have a life.
[00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:41.380]   We have some kind of a stream of behaviors.
[00:49:41.380 --> 00:49:45.020]   We have, there is an argument of free will, et cetera.
[00:49:45.020 --> 00:49:49.420]   There is a multiplicity, definitely a man is a legion.
[00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:52.180]   That's the real meaning of that phrase.
[00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:55.820]   One day you wake up like this.
[00:49:55.820 --> 00:49:58.320]   I say, Andrew, let's meet tomorrow at 7 a.m.,
[00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:00.580]   but I don't know who's gonna wake up tomorrow.
[00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:02.420]   And then you send me a text message.
[00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:07.060]   Oh, I'm feeling off, right?
[00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:09.540]   At 6.55 and go back to sleep.
[00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:12.280]   So examining that and seeing that,
[00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:14.180]   I think frees you up eventually.
[00:50:14.180 --> 00:50:17.600]   And start to orient you in a better direction.
[00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:22.300]   So what do you want to do and what,
[00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:25.500]   but in the orientation of also what you need to do.
[00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:28.980]   What you sense and what you are developing
[00:50:28.980 --> 00:50:32.820]   as an evolutionary direction for you.
[00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:34.400]   This is the important bit.
[00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:37.360]   Is it possible for everyone to engage
[00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:39.340]   in certain specific physical movement?
[00:50:39.340 --> 00:50:41.840]   For example, in Scandinavian countries,
[00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:44.640]   the squat is not very approachable.
[00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:48.760]   It's very difficult.
[00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:51.660]   They're more built for dragging heavy things.
[00:50:51.660 --> 00:50:56.600]   And also in this climate, I guess it makes less sense
[00:50:56.600 --> 00:50:59.400]   to squat and cause you're gonna freeze there.
[00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:03.840]   So this is, and then you see the squat in warm climates
[00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:07.000]   and it's like so open and accessible.
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.660]   They're very good deadlifters usually.
[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:13.000]   Not good squatters.
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:14.500]   - They wanna get away from the ground.
[00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:15.340]   - Yeah.
[00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:18.760]   The shallow hip socket, which allows one activity,
[00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:21.160]   but then the stability of the deep hip socket,
[00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:25.440]   the architecture of the hip, the femur heads,
[00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:28.320]   the cue angles, the shapes, et cetera.
[00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:31.260]   So we are all unique and there are certain elements
[00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:34.760]   which like, for example, my squat challenge is like,
[00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:37.440]   for most people, there is something there.
[00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:39.680]   - Did you remind people what the squat challenge is?
[00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:44.360]   - The squat was my attempt to bring a new,
[00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:48.200]   fresh state of mind into the word squat.
[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:51.460]   Not as a strength element.
[00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:55.560]   It's a fundamental resting position, really.
[00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:58.000]   Actually should be one of the most abundant ones.
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:01.720]   We replaced it with sitting, which is not really,
[00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:04.500]   doesn't work well if you're in a natural environment.
[00:52:04.500 --> 00:52:06.040]   It's not very comfortable, actually,
[00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:07.460]   to sit for long periods of time.
[00:52:07.460 --> 00:52:10.800]   Rocks and different terrains, so you end up lying down,
[00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:13.360]   standing, and squatting a lot.
[00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:15.620]   Also, when you're moving low and dynamic,
[00:52:15.620 --> 00:52:17.460]   like even collecting berries,
[00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:20.920]   the squat is much more dynamic and open.
[00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:23.000]   And then elimination is happening there.
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:24.720]   So it's like, it's such a fundamental thing
[00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:26.880]   and we totally eliminated it.
[00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:28.540]   We eliminated many other things.
[00:52:28.540 --> 00:52:32.020]   Overhead movements, behind the back,
[00:52:32.020 --> 00:52:35.380]   all kinds of back realm, what they call the back realm
[00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:39.240]   is totally absent in people's awareness.
[00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:41.420]   So that was my attempt to bring it back into people
[00:52:41.420 --> 00:52:46.420]   and I recommend it in order to really get the transformation
[00:52:46.420 --> 00:52:52.120]   going to accumulate 30 minutes a day in the squat position,
[00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:55.200]   unloaded, just resting down, not correct, not erect.
[00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:56.720]   Many people make this mistake.
[00:52:56.720 --> 00:52:58.720]   They didn't read through the whole thing.
[00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:00.480]   It's just resting down there.
[00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:03.280]   And of course, you have to be mindful of dosages.
[00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:06.680]   Some people will get hurt if they try to do it too quickly,
[00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:09.060]   so they might need a build-up process towards it.
[00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:11.760]   And also, I'm not talking about 30 minutes straight,
[00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:15.360]   but accumulation throughout the day.
[00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:18.700]   And this does a lot of good for digestive problems,
[00:53:18.700 --> 00:53:22.600]   for lower back pain, for hip pains, for knees,
[00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:24.660]   and generally for aging,
[00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:28.760]   because it's basically folding your body
[00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:30.000]   in the most basic way.
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:31.040]   Are you folding your body?
[00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:32.820]   If you're not folding your body,
[00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:35.140]   you will lose the foldability of your body.
[00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:38.060]   And this is probably the easiest
[00:53:38.060 --> 00:53:40.160]   and the most abundant way to fold a body.
[00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:46.220]   But this is an example of something that can be very useful
[00:53:46.220 --> 00:53:47.500]   with many, many people,
[00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:50.640]   but there will always be unique individuals
[00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:52.640]   which need something else.
[00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:57.640]   And there are benefits in examining things,
[00:53:57.640 --> 00:54:02.360]   and also there are benefits in getting hurt,
[00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:05.960]   which is not often discussed, especially not in these parts.
[00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:10.520]   So I'm one of the only ones, as a teacher,
[00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:12.820]   that says I injured many of my students.
[00:54:12.820 --> 00:54:15.660]   And if I did not do that,
[00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:19.980]   I would be totally useless for them as well.
[00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:24.980]   The totally safe system has nothing to offer, practically.
[00:54:24.980 --> 00:54:27.860]   Nothing is totally safe, and we can, of course,
[00:54:27.860 --> 00:54:31.300]   we don't approach it with a ballsy or machoistic thing,
[00:54:31.300 --> 00:54:33.120]   but we are aware that sometimes
[00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:34.740]   we have to go beyond the boundaries.
[00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:37.420]   And hopefully those would be the small injuries
[00:54:37.420 --> 00:54:40.060]   that will help us avoid the big injuries.
[00:54:40.060 --> 00:54:41.860]   But if you try to avoid the small injuries,
[00:54:41.860 --> 00:54:44.740]   maybe you'll get those big injuries in there.
[00:54:44.740 --> 00:54:48.700]   So examining which types and forms of movement,
[00:54:48.700 --> 00:54:53.180]   the location of the body, speed of execution,
[00:54:53.180 --> 00:54:55.660]   the type of organization of the body,
[00:54:55.660 --> 00:54:58.460]   which is a whole thing that we can discuss.
[00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:01.660]   All of this is up for the grabs,
[00:55:01.660 --> 00:55:03.500]   and it's something that we have to create
[00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:06.440]   individual relationship with,
[00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:08.260]   hopefully with good guidance,
[00:55:08.260 --> 00:55:12.180]   where we can get the right scenarios,
[00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:15.140]   a facilitator of good scenarios for our learning,
[00:55:15.140 --> 00:55:16.820]   which is what I try to do,
[00:55:16.820 --> 00:55:18.700]   and less of a technical state of mind,
[00:55:18.700 --> 00:55:22.720]   do this ABC or, yeah, like chunking,
[00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:26.100]   what I really dislike for a long time.
[00:55:26.100 --> 00:55:28.820]   It's like many people, they tell me,
[00:55:28.820 --> 00:55:30.240]   have you met this guy?
[00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:31.520]   He's an amazing teacher,
[00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:34.140]   because he chunked the process into these bits,
[00:55:34.140 --> 00:55:36.340]   and not even in the correct places to chunk.
[00:55:36.340 --> 00:55:40.960]   And it doesn't offer, it locks us, this state of mind.
[00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:42.880]   I talk about the chemistry model,
[00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:44.340]   I call it my chemistry model,
[00:55:44.340 --> 00:55:48.460]   where an atom, a molecule, and then a compound
[00:55:48.460 --> 00:55:50.960]   is conceptualized, versus just chunking.
[00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:53.120]   So there is an actual evolution,
[00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:56.580]   like I call it also sketch learning.
[00:55:56.580 --> 00:55:58.740]   I'm not going to try to draw you
[00:55:58.740 --> 00:56:01.300]   if I know anything about art and drawing.
[00:56:01.300 --> 00:56:04.300]   I'm going to start by capturing something very rough,
[00:56:04.300 --> 00:56:06.160]   and I need to practice that first,
[00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:10.140]   that dynamic entity, before I go into the rendering
[00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:11.660]   and the shading, et cetera.
[00:56:11.660 --> 00:56:15.320]   So the same way to learn things.
[00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:18.660]   So big picture to small details,
[00:56:18.660 --> 00:56:22.320]   and unlike many of my teachers that I ran into,
[00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:25.140]   and I say with the greatest respect,
[00:56:25.140 --> 00:56:26.740]   because I don't know who taught me more,
[00:56:26.740 --> 00:56:29.060]   my good teachers or my worst teachers,
[00:56:29.060 --> 00:56:32.900]   but some of them just teach from the small details
[00:56:32.900 --> 00:56:35.680]   into a big picture that never arrives.
[00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:39.460]   - Given that humans can generate such a broad array
[00:56:39.460 --> 00:56:43.340]   of types of movement, run, jump, duck, squat, leap,
[00:56:43.340 --> 00:56:45.760]   all these types of movements,
[00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:48.060]   do you think there's value in observing the movements
[00:56:48.060 --> 00:56:49.340]   of other animal species?
[00:56:49.340 --> 00:56:53.220]   I know I certainly enjoy watching other animals move.
[00:56:54.860 --> 00:56:59.180]   - I think the most, one of the more spectacular animal facts
[00:56:59.180 --> 00:57:02.100]   that was shared with me is when I was a graduate student,
[00:57:02.100 --> 00:57:05.260]   someone down the hall was working on the little petals
[00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:09.380]   of the chameleon, which can walk up walls,
[00:57:09.380 --> 00:57:11.300]   and it was a great mystery is whether or not
[00:57:11.300 --> 00:57:13.260]   they were suction, but it turns out they can do it
[00:57:13.260 --> 00:57:15.060]   in a vacuum, so it's not suction.
[00:57:15.060 --> 00:57:16.660]   Whether or not there was some sticky substance,
[00:57:16.660 --> 00:57:18.700]   and it turned out, I don't know,
[00:57:18.700 --> 00:57:20.020]   I feel compelled to share this with you,
[00:57:20.020 --> 00:57:21.860]   so I'm going to do it because I have a feeling
[00:57:21.860 --> 00:57:24.480]   it will lead us to an insight of some sort,
[00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:27.300]   that those little tiny petals are so thin
[00:57:27.300 --> 00:57:30.780]   and so close together that the chameleon
[00:57:30.780 --> 00:57:32.020]   actually sticks to the wall
[00:57:32.020 --> 00:57:34.440]   by what are called Van der Waal forces,
[00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:36.500]   meaning it's a very weak molecular force,
[00:57:36.500 --> 00:57:38.580]   but strong enough to stick to the wall
[00:57:38.580 --> 00:57:40.820]   because they are actually exchanging molecules
[00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:43.000]   with the surface they're on.
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:48.000]   So obviously we can't do that, and yet I spent hours,
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.260]   because they were in the lab next door,
[00:57:50.260 --> 00:57:53.100]   watching videos of these little chameleons walk,
[00:57:53.100 --> 00:57:56.700]   and the articulation of these feet is incredible
[00:57:56.700 --> 00:57:59.680]   because they're literally rolling those little petals along
[00:57:59.680 --> 00:58:04.340]   in a way that kind of defies anything else I've ever seen.
[00:58:04.340 --> 00:58:06.580]   I told myself this was useful,
[00:58:06.580 --> 00:58:07.900]   A, because I thought it was interesting,
[00:58:07.900 --> 00:58:10.520]   but B, because I never really thought about
[00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:12.060]   how I articulate my foot.
[00:58:12.060 --> 00:58:13.500]   I've thought about being a heel striker
[00:58:13.500 --> 00:58:14.860]   or a toe striker when I run,
[00:58:14.860 --> 00:58:17.420]   and no one can tell me which one I'm supposed to be.
[00:58:17.420 --> 00:58:21.600]   Maybe you can tell me, but the point is,
[00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:23.680]   or I suppose the question is,
[00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:25.420]   do you think there's value in observing
[00:58:25.420 --> 00:58:28.500]   the extremes of animal kingdom movement
[00:58:28.500 --> 00:58:30.580]   as a way to inform the play space
[00:58:30.580 --> 00:58:31.900]   and the exploration space
[00:58:31.900 --> 00:58:34.280]   of our own human movement practice?
[00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:36.420]   - I think so.
[00:58:36.420 --> 00:58:39.120]   I think it's, first, it's inspiring.
[00:58:39.120 --> 00:58:44.120]   It opens up, but I will take it away
[00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:47.300]   from the romantic point of view,
[00:58:47.300 --> 00:58:50.220]   and I would offer another way to examine
[00:58:50.220 --> 00:58:55.220]   all these movements exist in us in ways, in certain ways,
[00:58:55.220 --> 00:58:59.440]   like the work of Grokovetsky on the spine,
[00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:04.440]   the spinal engine, and to see how these old ways of moving,
[00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:09.200]   even all the way up to exoskeletons
[00:59:09.200 --> 00:59:14.200]   and primary, very ancient, or even single-cell things,
[00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:17.820]   are still within us to a certain extent.
[00:59:17.820 --> 00:59:20.580]   And then, of course, this gets developed,
[00:59:20.580 --> 00:59:27.260]   like the Darwinian state of mind got stuck for many years
[00:59:27.260 --> 00:59:29.260]   on the survival of the fittest.
[00:59:29.260 --> 00:59:33.180]   But actually, I believe, I always believed,
[00:59:33.180 --> 00:59:36.140]   and I saw some information about it lately,
[00:59:36.140 --> 00:59:39.380]   that mutation is the heart of the model,
[00:59:39.380 --> 00:59:41.200]   not survival of the fittest.
[00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:43.260]   - Yeah, people often hear the word mutation,
[00:59:43.260 --> 00:59:45.340]   and they think, oh, mutations are bad.
[00:59:45.340 --> 00:59:47.940]   There are maladaptive mutations,
[00:59:47.940 --> 00:59:50.780]   and then there are adaptive mutations, for sure.
[00:59:50.780 --> 00:59:54.500]   - And it displaces the word change in the heart of it.
[00:59:54.500 --> 00:59:58.200]   What it wants to do, change.
[00:59:58.200 --> 01:00:00.980]   So it does not want to become better.
[01:00:00.980 --> 01:00:06.980]   There is an inherent change in it.
[01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:11.480]   And then, of course, the become better at XYZ fittest
[01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:14.380]   is the secondary perspective that arrives
[01:00:14.380 --> 01:00:15.820]   in relation to certain things.
[01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:17.260]   But there is still a stronger,
[01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:20.860]   more ancient driving force into the process.
[01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:24.440]   So for me, this is cool to see these animals
[01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:26.740]   take it all the way to this extreme,
[01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:29.660]   but it's also still reflecting within us.
[01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:31.540]   So I love to do, like, for example,
[01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:34.500]   I introduce with people spinal waves.
[01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:37.540]   And by bringing these waves into the body,
[01:00:37.540 --> 01:00:40.740]   sometimes you get weird experiences,
[01:00:40.740 --> 01:00:45.300]   like emotional releases, and sometimes, and other times,
[01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:48.760]   it can become an incredible tool to help an athlete
[01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:51.800]   which specialized and reached the top of the top.
[01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:54.980]   And then you defrag his system a little bit
[01:00:54.980 --> 01:00:59.380]   and offer him some freshness and some segmental movement.
[01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:01.740]   And first you fuck him up.
[01:01:01.740 --> 01:01:03.500]   That's usually the case.
[01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:05.960]   Technically, he's off, his coordination's off,
[01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:08.860]   but later the growth will arrive.
[01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:10.660]   It's a form of playfulness.
[01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:12.940]   It's a form of examining things
[01:01:12.940 --> 01:01:15.380]   regardless of their success or failure.
[01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:18.420]   More understanding that change is important.
[01:01:18.420 --> 01:01:20.980]   And then after that, we can also look
[01:01:20.980 --> 01:01:24.380]   at the more competitive state of mind
[01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:27.400]   and the more success and failure orientation.
[01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:30.800]   But there is no game without change.
[01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:32.860]   So this is the primary one.
[01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:36.540]   And that's why I say, okay, you wanna succeed in the tasks
[01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:39.660]   like we did earlier, but you stayed within the game
[01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:40.660]   to sustain the game,
[01:01:40.660 --> 01:01:44.940]   the infinite versus finite game, right, perspective.
[01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:49.220]   To sustain the game means to continue to change,
[01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:53.740]   continue to transform, and then to win the game
[01:01:53.740 --> 01:01:55.340]   sometimes mean game over.
[01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:59.920]   So it's like, yeah, within that tension,
[01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:04.540]   I think it's beautiful to play and to exist and to be.
[01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:06.160]   - You mentioned something that for me
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:09.680]   is an incredibly important concept for a couple of reasons.
[01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:11.840]   And you mentioned these spinal waves, right?
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:15.040]   I have to assume that's taking the torso for us,
[01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:18.160]   you know, movement morons that I'll just refer to
[01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:21.200]   in course terms instead of thoracic spine.
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:23.400]   I mean, we'll stay away from the technical anatomy
[01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:27.200]   and the torso and creating movement either side to side,
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:32.200]   undulation or arching and extension of the spine.
[01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:35.460]   - Yeah, dorsal, ventral, side to side, rotational,
[01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:36.660]   this was spiraling.
[01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:43.180]   - Have you ever had the experience of yourself
[01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:45.340]   or other people engaging in those types of movements
[01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:48.740]   and experiencing particular categories of emotions?
[01:02:48.740 --> 01:02:50.460]   And I have a particular reason for asking this.
[01:02:50.460 --> 01:02:51.920]   There's no right or wrong answer, of course,
[01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:55.220]   but I'm just curious whether or not movement of the,
[01:02:55.220 --> 01:02:56.640]   let's call it the core of the body,
[01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:58.980]   things close to the midline as opposed to far away
[01:02:58.980 --> 01:03:01.220]   from the midline, like the digits far.
[01:03:01.220 --> 01:03:03.500]   Is there any, do you have any evidence
[01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:07.960]   that that can evoke a certain category of emotional states?
[01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:10.840]   - Evidence, I have none, but I have experience
[01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:12.760]   and I have some thoughts about it.
[01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:18.960]   Ida Rolf, who is known to have created Rolfing
[01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:20.200]   or structural integration,
[01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:23.080]   said the issues are in the tissues.
[01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:27.680]   And around the spine, the spine is us, as you know.
[01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:30.100]   It's like you can take an arm off a limb,
[01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:35.100]   but there's been attempts, but there is no brainy alone,
[01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:38.580]   this cerebral thing alone.
[01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:42.240]   The spine and maybe more parts and systems
[01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:44.020]   inside the torso are important.
[01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:46.820]   So that's why I like to start from that core entity.
[01:03:46.820 --> 01:03:50.760]   And then these little fluctuations, they create,
[01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:56.820]   they unblock things, they start to move things,
[01:03:56.820 --> 01:03:59.740]   and you can avoid, funny enough,
[01:03:59.740 --> 01:04:04.620]   mobilizing those areas by doing big frame motions
[01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:07.540]   and competitive motions and techniques all your life.
[01:04:07.540 --> 01:04:11.220]   So even some, most yogis, for example,
[01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:13.580]   they look extremely mobile.
[01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:15.900]   But then when you're actually going into the small,
[01:04:15.900 --> 01:04:17.640]   what I call the small frame,
[01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:20.220]   I borrowed this from Chinese martial arts,
[01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:21.580]   small frame, big frame.
[01:04:21.580 --> 01:04:24.620]   The big frame is these big changes
[01:04:24.620 --> 01:04:28.260]   of our total body in space posture.
[01:04:28.260 --> 01:04:30.380]   And then the small frame is barely moving,
[01:04:30.380 --> 01:04:32.420]   but mobilizing the little bits
[01:04:32.420 --> 01:04:35.800]   that comprise the same pretty much posture.
[01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:37.220]   So these are very beneficial,
[01:04:37.220 --> 01:04:41.740]   and it has totally disappeared from our physical culture.
[01:04:41.740 --> 01:04:43.280]   When you introduce it back,
[01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:47.180]   the small frame offers the big frame,
[01:04:47.180 --> 01:04:49.420]   but the big frame doesn't offer the small frame
[01:04:49.420 --> 01:04:51.580]   because, of course, the small detail
[01:04:51.580 --> 01:04:53.460]   come together into the big picture.
[01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:56.120]   So if I wanna place my body in a specific position
[01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:58.160]   and I have all these bits moving well,
[01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:00.820]   I can construct it in whatever way I want.
[01:05:00.820 --> 01:05:02.680]   But if I just work on the big one,
[01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:07.440]   most chances are I just mobilize certain areas
[01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:11.060]   while other areas are totally held or blocked,
[01:05:11.060 --> 01:05:14.600]   and then I'm specialized one more time.
[01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:17.920]   Take me out of this realm and I'll have difficulties.
[01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:20.340]   What will sit there in this stagnation?
[01:05:20.340 --> 01:05:25.160]   Emotion, material, thoughts, traumas.
[01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:28.400]   That's why people get discharges.
[01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:32.560]   And the body, memory is not what we think it is.
[01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:33.400]   That's how I believe.
[01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:36.800]   It is stored everywhere.
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:40.660]   And I've had those experiences.
[01:05:40.660 --> 01:05:42.680]   A lot of people have the opposite.
[01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:45.080]   When a certain emotion is evoked,
[01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:47.100]   they start to undulate the spine.
[01:05:47.100 --> 01:05:50.380]   So this can be worked from this direction
[01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:51.340]   or from this direction.
[01:05:51.340 --> 01:05:55.480]   And I believe by applying such a practice,
[01:05:55.480 --> 01:05:58.880]   it is wise.
[01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:01.580]   You basically turn over the land
[01:06:01.580 --> 01:06:06.440]   and you are allowing things to shift
[01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:08.400]   and to move and to adapt.
[01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:09.960]   So I highly recommend it.
[01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:13.780]   And we teach it in a very elaborate and gradual way.
[01:06:13.780 --> 01:06:18.180]   And this is needed really because people,
[01:06:18.180 --> 01:06:20.900]   when they just go into some general recommendation,
[01:06:20.900 --> 01:06:23.380]   they usually just get stuck into a new pattern.
[01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:25.540]   Ah, that spinal wave, okay.
[01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:26.380]   That's it.
[01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:28.100]   So I've been using, again, these slice and dice,
[01:06:28.100 --> 01:06:31.740]   like teaching dozens of systems of moving the torso
[01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:35.060]   until a person is free to really move the torso,
[01:06:35.060 --> 01:06:36.920]   like the language is created.
[01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:40.760]   The small enough units are created in your understanding
[01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:42.440]   from all these systems.
[01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:43.660]   And then you improvise.
[01:06:43.660 --> 01:06:45.820]   You reach the highest level of the practice.
[01:06:45.820 --> 01:06:48.480]   I love the answer.
[01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:51.320]   - Let me tell you a bit of why I asked.
[01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:56.440]   So there's a principle in neuroscience,
[01:06:56.440 --> 01:06:59.960]   but especially in neuroevolution, they call it evo-devo,
[01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:02.520]   sometimes evolution and development, how those link.
[01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:05.040]   If you look at, so we have motor neurons, as you know,
[01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:07.240]   but for the audience that live in our spinal cord
[01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:09.660]   that cause transmission and contraction of the muscles
[01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:11.440]   allow us to move our limbs.
[01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:13.040]   And then we have motor neurons up here
[01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:15.060]   called upper motor neurons that control the motor,
[01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:15.900]   lower one.
[01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:17.520]   So when something is reflexive or learned,
[01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:19.720]   we're not thinking about it, so to speak.
[01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:21.360]   We mainly use the lower motor neurons.
[01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:23.200]   We know this because you can do an experiment.
[01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:24.600]   It's a rather barbaric experiment,
[01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:26.600]   but it's been done many times
[01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:28.900]   called creating a decerebrate cat.
[01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:30.840]   You actually remove the neocortex
[01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:33.000]   and these cats will walk on a treadmill.
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.400]   It's called fictive motion.
[01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:35.520]   No problem at all.
[01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:38.380]   There are human beings who don't have a neocortex
[01:07:38.380 --> 01:07:40.400]   or much of their neocortex is missing.
[01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:42.640]   They generate perfectly fine movement.
[01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:44.260]   - The pattern has been downloaded.
[01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:45.100]   - That's right.
[01:07:45.100 --> 01:07:47.860]   It's truly downloaded into the spine
[01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:49.940]   and the connection between the spine and muscles.
[01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:53.820]   Now, the motor neurons that control the spinal waves,
[01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:58.260]   as you call them, are of a particular category.
[01:07:58.260 --> 01:08:01.180]   They have a molecular signature, a physiological signature.
[01:08:01.180 --> 01:08:03.380]   They were identified by, he's dead now,
[01:08:03.380 --> 01:08:07.100]   but a biologist at Columbia University named Tom Jessel
[01:08:07.100 --> 01:08:08.960]   and many of his scientific offspring.
[01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:10.680]   Here's what's interesting.
[01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:14.940]   In fish or in animals that really only have the opportunity
[01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:19.000]   to undulate and flap their little fins,
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:24.540]   the motor neurons that control undulation in those animals
[01:08:24.540 --> 01:08:27.000]   are identical molecularly to the motor neurons
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.560]   that control the spinal undulation in humans.
[01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:34.500]   What's been added in human evolution are extra rows,
[01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:37.300]   literally categories of molecularly distinct neurons
[01:08:37.300 --> 01:08:40.640]   so that as you move from the center of the body outward,
[01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:43.440]   unlike a fish, which can move its fins,
[01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:45.840]   but can't actually, it doesn't have digits.
[01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:48.980]   We have special motor neurons to move these little bits,
[01:08:48.980 --> 01:08:53.000]   these bits, these bits, and I can't do a spinal wave,
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:57.360]   but I can do the mudras thing, like the belly thing.
[01:08:57.360 --> 01:08:58.960]   And that comes from seeing the movie "E.T."
[01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:01.060]   when I was a kid and puffing out my stomach
[01:09:01.060 --> 01:09:03.140]   and then realizing that I could wave it,
[01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:05.800]   but only in one direction and currently not up.
[01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:10.520]   Anyway, the yogis out there can chuckle at that, but.
[01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:12.420]   - The yogis actually do it to the side.
[01:09:12.420 --> 01:09:13.560]   - Oh, do they? - Yeah.
[01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:15.520]   - I don't know if I can do that.
[01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:19.500]   Anyway, my spinal wave is weak, but I'll work on it.
[01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:23.480]   But what I find so interesting about these layers of,
[01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:26.160]   I don't want to say sophistication, but these,
[01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:28.680]   with evolution came the addition
[01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:30.880]   of more pools of opportunity.
[01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:32.400]   These motor neuron pools, as they're called,
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:35.120]   are opportunity to engage in new,
[01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:36.940]   more elaborate types of movement.
[01:09:36.940 --> 01:09:39.720]   But with each new pool became the opportunity
[01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:42.700]   to create combinations of new movement.
[01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:43.940]   And so the reason I asked you
[01:09:43.940 --> 01:09:46.920]   why spinal waves create one category of movement
[01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:50.180]   is that if you touch a fish on one side of its body,
[01:09:50.180 --> 01:09:51.840]   it moves to the opposite side.
[01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:53.500]   It never moves toward it.
[01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:55.740]   But earlier we were doing a practice somewhat similar
[01:09:55.740 --> 01:09:58.160]   of testing this similar reflex.
[01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:02.880]   And sometimes I or someone will move toward a touch.
[01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:05.500]   We don't deviate to the opposite side.
[01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:10.500]   So I have this untested,
[01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:12.260]   at least formally tested hypothesis
[01:10:12.260 --> 01:10:16.500]   that movements of small digits and portions of our distal,
[01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:19.640]   as they're called, far from the midline body parts,
[01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:21.560]   evoke different sensations,
[01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:23.760]   maybe even far more subtle sensations
[01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:25.760]   than movements of the core of our body
[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:29.120]   and the stuff closer to the spine.
[01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:30.520]   Again, it's just a theory,
[01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:33.300]   but I am grateful for your answer
[01:10:33.300 --> 01:10:36.140]   because it lands at least in the general vector direction
[01:10:36.140 --> 01:10:39.500]   of my idea here.
[01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:44.500]   - The central orientation is mostly gone from our culture.
[01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:47.920]   We don't even walk basically these days.
[01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:49.740]   If you look at traditional culture,
[01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:52.980]   the amount of walking you do on a rest day,
[01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:54.000]   it's huge.
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:57.620]   And so we started to create technologies
[01:10:57.620 --> 01:11:00.500]   to bring everything into the periphery,
[01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:02.680]   controlling it with the fingertips, et cetera.
[01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:05.900]   So we have incredible neurological development
[01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:07.220]   relating to this,
[01:11:07.220 --> 01:11:12.180]   but our central patterns, swimming, running, jumping,
[01:11:12.180 --> 01:11:15.820]   throwing, throwing is not pushing away.
[01:11:15.820 --> 01:11:17.140]   That's an example, right?
[01:11:17.140 --> 01:11:19.460]   - Some people, when you give them a ball to throw,
[01:11:19.460 --> 01:11:21.200]   you can tell if they've never thrown a ball before.
[01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:23.400]   - Yeah, they throw like a girl.
[01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:25.300]   That is often said here in the US.
[01:11:25.300 --> 01:11:26.760]   And it's, of course, unfair,
[01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:29.480]   but it relates to experience, right?
[01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:34.380]   That is less maybe promoted or offered for females.
[01:11:34.380 --> 01:11:37.860]   So you get this peripheral pattern
[01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:40.400]   instead of a central generated pattern
[01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:43.140]   that progresses towards the extremities.
[01:11:43.140 --> 01:11:48.080]   One thing I wanted to ask you is,
[01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:51.500]   I know an area that is not often mentioned
[01:11:51.500 --> 01:11:54.500]   is that some of these ancient patterns and systems
[01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:57.780]   are primary in many ways.
[01:11:57.780 --> 01:12:01.480]   Hence, those newer developments inside of us
[01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:04.700]   are constrained by using the connections
[01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:07.020]   running through these ancient systems.
[01:12:07.020 --> 01:12:12.020]   Hence, we are much more limited by the gene pool.
[01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:19.900]   We are hitchhikers on a piece of DNA, I like to say.
[01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:23.980]   And that gene pool is driving something so primary
[01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:28.780]   that even when you are in kind of the driver's seat
[01:12:28.780 --> 01:12:30.900]   in your eyes, you're actually not,
[01:12:30.900 --> 01:12:34.380]   or you're being totally constrained by that.
[01:12:34.380 --> 01:12:37.820]   And I wanted to hear about this.
[01:12:37.820 --> 01:12:41.500]   - Yeah, recently we had a guest on the podcast
[01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:44.380]   named Eric Jarvis, he's a professor at Rockefeller,
[01:12:44.380 --> 01:12:47.420]   who was offered a position to dance
[01:12:47.420 --> 01:12:49.060]   with the Alvin Ailey Dance Company.
[01:12:49.060 --> 01:12:51.840]   So an accomplished dancer and comes from a musical family,
[01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:53.540]   chose to become a neuroscientist instead
[01:12:53.540 --> 01:12:55.100]   and study speech and language.
[01:12:55.100 --> 01:12:58.260]   But he said something incredible, several incredible things.
[01:12:58.260 --> 01:13:00.900]   Really looking forward to getting your reflections on.
[01:13:00.900 --> 01:13:05.820]   First of all, he said that when you look at the species
[01:13:05.820 --> 01:13:09.100]   in the kingdom of animals, including us,
[01:13:09.100 --> 01:13:12.860]   that have elaborate language and true song,
[01:13:12.860 --> 01:13:18.040]   they all also have the capacity to dance.
[01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:20.780]   All the, it turns out hummingbirds actually have a dance
[01:13:20.780 --> 01:13:25.180]   and a song capacity that perhaps,
[01:13:25.180 --> 01:13:27.600]   and this is the going idea now in neuroscience
[01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:31.820]   and evolution of the brain, that singing actually came
[01:13:31.820 --> 01:13:36.320]   before finally articulated speech and language.
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:39.540]   That voice involved first to sing, to communicate.
[01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:43.120]   I mean, to enunciate, ugh, or ugh, or you know, or mm.
[01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:46.220]   But then song may have come first.
[01:13:46.220 --> 01:13:49.020]   Where you have song, you have dance
[01:13:49.020 --> 01:13:50.120]   and the capacity to dance,
[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:52.060]   which of course is movement of the body.
[01:13:52.060 --> 01:13:54.300]   And where you have song and dance,
[01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:56.660]   you always find that those species
[01:13:56.660 --> 01:13:58.920]   can generate elaborate language.
[01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:01.500]   Now, the simple version of this is, okay,
[01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:03.820]   sophisticated brains tend to create clusters
[01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:05.840]   of sophisticated capabilities.
[01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:07.060]   But the other possibility,
[01:14:07.060 --> 01:14:08.700]   and it's the one that Jarvis proposes,
[01:14:08.700 --> 01:14:10.860]   and I think it's in line with what you're perhaps
[01:14:10.860 --> 01:14:14.420]   raising here, is the idea that movement of the body
[01:14:14.420 --> 01:14:17.760]   and range and sophistication of movement of the body
[01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:20.080]   through all these different systems,
[01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:24.160]   may have actually promoted or even driven the evolution
[01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:27.880]   of the things that we think of as, you know,
[01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:32.140]   speech and language and the ability to have multiple words
[01:14:32.140 --> 01:14:34.660]   for the same concept or to have elaborate
[01:14:34.660 --> 01:14:36.240]   articulation of speech.
[01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:39.500]   I find this incredibly attractive as an idea
[01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:43.220]   because certainly from, as a hierarchy of needs,
[01:14:43.220 --> 01:14:45.620]   we needed to move first to survive and to mate
[01:14:45.620 --> 01:14:48.300]   and to flee and to attack.
[01:14:48.300 --> 01:14:50.520]   It makes perfect sense to me that the layers would be built
[01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:52.580]   up fundamentally from the body to the mind
[01:14:52.580 --> 01:14:55.160]   and not the other way around.
[01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:56.200]   So that's one piece.
[01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:59.280]   And then the other piece, which I'll just share
[01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:00.640]   for any reflections you might have,
[01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:05.640]   that just blew me away was Jarvis told me that when we read,
[01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:10.500]   if, and this has been done experimentally,
[01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:14.540]   if one records the EMG, the low level muscular activity
[01:15:14.540 --> 01:15:16.100]   in the larynx and pharynx,
[01:15:16.100 --> 01:15:19.560]   we are actually repeating the words that we read,
[01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:23.660]   but so subtly so that we don't actually speak them out
[01:15:23.660 --> 01:15:26.140]   unless there's some sort of neurologic deficit,
[01:15:26.140 --> 01:15:27.280]   which some people have.
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:28.520]   Some people mumble why they read,
[01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:33.040]   but what that tells me is that language is movement
[01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:35.060]   and movement is language.
[01:15:35.060 --> 01:15:37.180]   So again, we have this convergence,
[01:15:37.180 --> 01:15:40.780]   but at a very basic level, I'd love your reflections on,
[01:15:40.780 --> 01:15:42.020]   those are all his ideas.
[01:15:42.020 --> 01:15:44.180]   I want to say I'm just repeating what he said
[01:15:44.180 --> 01:15:47.540]   and not nearly as precisely as he did,
[01:15:47.540 --> 01:15:51.140]   but how do you think of movement
[01:15:51.140 --> 01:15:54.500]   as either the foundation of language
[01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:58.640]   or as its own language that perhaps even defies words?
[01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:04.860]   - Wow, those are beautiful perspectives
[01:16:04.860 --> 01:16:07.280]   and I definitely feel the same.
[01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:11.180]   There's a lot to say about singing and dancing as well
[01:16:11.180 --> 01:16:16.180]   and also as a form of ancient programs of transmission.
[01:16:16.180 --> 01:16:24.980]   Sometimes there is this, in some ancient practices,
[01:16:24.980 --> 01:16:29.980]   the mantras and people don't realize
[01:16:29.980 --> 01:16:33.900]   that they are tantric practices.
[01:16:33.900 --> 01:16:38.540]   They contain a form of vibrating and breathing
[01:16:38.540 --> 01:16:43.540]   all tied together into a very elaborate way
[01:16:43.540 --> 01:16:48.060]   to promote a certain effect.
[01:16:48.060 --> 01:16:50.520]   And how would you do something like this in ancient times?
[01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:52.160]   This is ingenious.
[01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:54.500]   We, even until today, we need a full book
[01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:55.340]   to describe something like this
[01:16:55.340 --> 01:16:57.480]   and it wouldn't work as well.
[01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:00.540]   So it's like a very ancient form of transmission.
[01:17:00.540 --> 01:17:05.180]   The more accurate we became with the language,
[01:17:06.460 --> 01:17:08.700]   the more dead it became
[01:17:08.700 --> 01:17:12.620]   because it is less of a movement entity.
[01:17:12.620 --> 01:17:15.900]   It is less of a dynamic entity from its nature
[01:17:15.900 --> 01:17:19.740]   and that's why Yukio Mishima says it's corrupting.
[01:17:19.740 --> 01:17:20.980]   It corrupts us.
[01:17:20.980 --> 01:17:27.340]   So definitely, definitely the conducing force
[01:17:27.340 --> 01:17:34.140]   or the primary force for me is movement that is experienced.
[01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:37.180]   Every time we talk about movement,
[01:17:37.180 --> 01:17:41.220]   basically, even now, we are spilling it into a container
[01:17:41.220 --> 01:17:44.560]   to call it what it is, but it is beyond that.
[01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:49.020]   So then it is applied into dancing,
[01:17:49.020 --> 01:17:51.180]   into singing, into language.
[01:17:51.180 --> 01:17:56.480]   There is no other language that I see as a primary mode
[01:17:56.480 --> 01:18:01.380]   and this is a nature of space, time, things moving.
[01:18:03.380 --> 01:18:07.300]   So I think everything moves into the direction
[01:18:07.300 --> 01:18:09.460]   of understanding that more and more
[01:18:09.460 --> 01:18:13.060]   and maybe it's not so popular to call it movement.
[01:18:13.060 --> 01:18:15.740]   People have some connotations and it's okay,
[01:18:15.740 --> 01:18:17.900]   you can throw away this word and put another word
[01:18:17.900 --> 01:18:20.860]   and we probably need to do that also, like, regularly.
[01:18:20.860 --> 01:18:24.120]   Like, I start to see the end of this word for me.
[01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:29.120]   Things get corrupted again, overused, abused,
[01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:32.840]   and then we need a new word.
[01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:36.720]   And even that word is only needed for communication
[01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:41.460]   and for specific processes of education, exchange.
[01:18:41.460 --> 01:18:44.320]   It's important to stay within the experiences.
[01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:47.160]   It's important to continue to promote scenarios
[01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:49.420]   in which the experience is primary,
[01:18:49.420 --> 01:18:52.760]   more open experience, let's say,
[01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:57.760]   and not try to hold down and define overly accurately
[01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:03.420]   or if it's done, throwing it away and starting again.
[01:19:03.420 --> 01:19:05.900]   So there is no winning concept.
[01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:08.300]   You got to the winning concept, you got nothing.
[01:19:08.300 --> 01:19:12.700]   You were able to grab it, you were able to,
[01:19:12.700 --> 01:19:14.560]   this is very science, right?
[01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:16.560]   Like, we got it, we got it.
[01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:19.220]   And then it turns out to be nothing
[01:19:19.220 --> 01:19:23.140]   and more and more time passes.
[01:19:23.140 --> 01:19:26.700]   I feel science is becoming more humble
[01:19:26.700 --> 01:19:31.700]   and things are being discussed in this way.
[01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:37.160]   And because really what the science do,
[01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:41.800]   report the sun came up a certain amount
[01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:45.140]   of billions of times and then tomorrow
[01:19:45.140 --> 01:19:47.560]   it will come up again, statistics.
[01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:48.500]   Yeah, it's good prediction.
[01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:51.440]   Yeah, yeah, but we can go beyond.
[01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:54.700]   There is something inside of us that can go beyond.
[01:19:54.700 --> 01:19:55.940]   Hard to communicate.
[01:19:55.940 --> 01:19:59.540]   I can't offer it right now here, but I have the experience
[01:19:59.540 --> 01:20:03.780]   and thankfully I have a practice and a way to sense it,
[01:20:03.780 --> 01:20:05.740]   to feel it and to re-examine it.
[01:20:05.740 --> 01:20:07.200]   And then we can talk about it
[01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:09.500]   and have something from that.
[01:20:09.500 --> 01:20:13.220]   - Edward Wilson, the great sociobiologist,
[01:20:13.220 --> 01:20:15.940]   he actually founded the field of sociobiology, E.O. Wilson,
[01:20:15.940 --> 01:20:17.740]   they call him Edward Wilson,
[01:20:17.740 --> 01:20:20.340]   had this beautiful word and indeed named a book.
[01:20:20.340 --> 01:20:21.780]   Actually, the word was better than the book.
[01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:24.340]   Sorry, Wilson, but the book was a little bit meandering
[01:20:24.340 --> 01:20:26.500]   for my taste, but then again,
[01:20:26.500 --> 01:20:29.060]   he's the Harvard professor, not me.
[01:20:29.060 --> 01:20:30.980]   Well, Stanford's pretty darn good.
[01:20:30.980 --> 01:20:33.660]   This word is consilience.
[01:20:33.660 --> 01:20:36.420]   This idea of a leaping together of divergent forms
[01:20:36.420 --> 01:20:39.580]   of knowledge to create a truly valuable concept,
[01:20:39.580 --> 01:20:40.980]   which I love.
[01:20:40.980 --> 01:20:43.220]   I love it because of course I'm formally trained
[01:20:43.220 --> 01:20:44.040]   as a scientist.
[01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:45.860]   I look at things mainly through the lens of neuroscience,
[01:20:45.860 --> 01:20:50.860]   but experience is real and observation is real.
[01:20:50.860 --> 01:20:52.920]   And even in the field of medicine,
[01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:56.300]   you have double blind placebo controlled clinical trials,
[01:20:56.300 --> 01:20:59.540]   and then you have case studies.
[01:20:59.540 --> 01:21:01.100]   N of one, right?
[01:21:01.100 --> 01:21:02.360]   Not often discussed, right?
[01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:06.280]   I mean, HM, the most famous example in neuroscience
[01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:08.700]   of a patient that had no hippocampus,
[01:21:08.700 --> 01:21:10.980]   informed us more about the process of memory
[01:21:10.980 --> 01:21:13.320]   and indeed the function of the hippocampus
[01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:17.420]   than thousands of independent experiments that followed.
[01:21:17.420 --> 01:21:19.500]   So you can't have one,
[01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:21.520]   you need all these different forms of exploration,
[01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:26.060]   which is, I think we share the belief, if I may,
[01:21:26.060 --> 01:21:28.540]   that convergent forms of knowledge,
[01:21:28.540 --> 01:21:30.940]   eventually this process of consilience
[01:21:30.940 --> 01:21:33.260]   can eject a new concept.
[01:21:33.260 --> 01:21:35.980]   And yet the challenge again is that
[01:21:35.980 --> 01:21:37.320]   if we don't have a language for it,
[01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:38.860]   it becomes hard to transmit.
[01:21:38.860 --> 01:21:44.340]   One of the things that I find incredibly,
[01:21:44.340 --> 01:21:46.040]   I'll use this word again, sticky,
[01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:48.620]   is this notion of movement culture.
[01:21:48.620 --> 01:21:50.260]   I don't know who coined that phrase,
[01:21:50.260 --> 01:21:53.560]   or I've seen it in the circles and accounts
[01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:56.180]   around your Instagram account and others.
[01:21:56.180 --> 01:21:58.860]   I don't know if that's a phrase that you coined,
[01:21:58.860 --> 01:22:01.960]   but this idea of engaging in movement practice with others,
[01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:05.380]   whether or not it's dance or other movement practices,
[01:22:05.380 --> 01:22:09.040]   because it's so dynamic, there's the unpredictability of it.
[01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:10.660]   Even to like today,
[01:22:10.660 --> 01:22:13.720]   two practitioners at vastly different levels of knowledge
[01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:15.840]   and experience in movement practice,
[01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:17.360]   there's information I like to think
[01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:19.660]   to be gained from both sides.
[01:22:19.660 --> 01:22:24.660]   So one thing that I've heard you say before,
[01:22:24.660 --> 01:22:27.300]   which really resonated with me,
[01:22:27.300 --> 01:22:29.780]   is this idea that people have,
[01:22:29.780 --> 01:22:32.340]   maybe in particular in the US have this concept of,
[01:22:32.340 --> 01:22:36.680]   oh, I have my yoga friends or the people I dance with
[01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:39.740]   are distinct from my family friends are distinct from,
[01:22:39.740 --> 01:22:43.860]   but as you pointed out, gathering around movement
[01:22:43.860 --> 01:22:46.940]   is an age-old tradition.
[01:22:46.940 --> 01:22:48.980]   And that perhaps we'd be better off
[01:22:48.980 --> 01:22:52.180]   not thinking about people we exercise with or train with,
[01:22:52.180 --> 01:22:56.860]   but that friendship and connection made through movement
[01:22:56.860 --> 01:23:00.700]   is perhaps the most valuable form of connection.
[01:23:00.700 --> 01:23:03.500]   - Yeah, I think it's a product of those practices
[01:23:03.500 --> 01:23:07.220]   that are maybe not so aware
[01:23:07.220 --> 01:23:10.300]   or not so movement-oriented in the open sense.
[01:23:10.300 --> 01:23:13.880]   And then you get this sensation with people,
[01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:16.020]   but alone we do nothing.
[01:23:16.020 --> 01:23:20.180]   So much so that we're never alone, also on the inside,
[01:23:20.180 --> 01:23:25.180]   and we will manufacture and produce entities inside.
[01:23:25.180 --> 01:23:30.300]   So we're constantly in a dynamic exchange,
[01:23:30.300 --> 01:23:31.460]   cultural exchange.
[01:23:31.460 --> 01:23:35.600]   And practically I learned this lesson in Capoeira.
[01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:39.620]   It's a cultural manifestation.
[01:23:39.620 --> 01:23:43.960]   Things happen within this context.
[01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:45.940]   We rub against reality.
[01:23:45.940 --> 01:23:47.680]   We rub against each other.
[01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:53.940]   And their movement occurs and their insight is to be gained
[01:23:53.940 --> 01:23:57.380]   and development happens.
[01:23:57.380 --> 01:24:03.020]   And then comes other thoughts,
[01:24:03.020 --> 01:24:05.920]   collective knowledge versus self-knowledge.
[01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:08.820]   We are transmitting knowledge.
[01:24:08.820 --> 01:24:12.700]   If we go on top of some mountain, 20 people,
[01:24:12.700 --> 01:24:17.700]   20 normal individuals,
[01:24:17.700 --> 01:24:22.580]   and we spend 20 years just fighting,
[01:24:22.580 --> 01:24:25.540]   four hours in the morning, four hours in the afternoon.
[01:24:25.540 --> 01:24:28.360]   We do it for 20 years,
[01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:32.380]   but we're isolated from any other source of knowledge.
[01:24:32.380 --> 01:24:34.980]   We would still not reach anything
[01:24:34.980 --> 01:24:39.420]   that a very young fighter these days has.
[01:24:41.060 --> 01:24:44.780]   We will be unable to develop those techniques,
[01:24:44.780 --> 01:24:45.980]   those insights.
[01:24:45.980 --> 01:24:47.660]   That's where collective knowledge comes in
[01:24:47.660 --> 01:24:51.220]   and transmission jumps us forward.
[01:24:51.220 --> 01:24:53.540]   But what is the problem with that?
[01:24:53.540 --> 01:24:56.700]   Staying within just those technical constraints
[01:24:56.700 --> 01:24:58.240]   and never making it yours.
[01:24:58.240 --> 01:25:00.880]   That's the part of self-knowledge.
[01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:05.580]   The digestion of this collective information
[01:25:05.580 --> 01:25:09.540]   until it becomes digested and becomes part of yourselves,
[01:25:09.540 --> 01:25:14.140]   and then you are it versus you are doing it.
[01:25:14.140 --> 01:25:17.420]   And this is a clear separation that you can see in sports
[01:25:17.420 --> 01:25:21.100]   on a very high level and on a not so high level,
[01:25:21.100 --> 01:25:24.620]   even though I would be honest if I say
[01:25:24.620 --> 01:25:27.420]   that some people reach very far
[01:25:27.420 --> 01:25:31.260]   just with collective knowledge and a very technical approach
[01:25:31.260 --> 01:25:36.260]   and others reach extremely far with very little of it.
[01:25:36.260 --> 01:25:38.400]   And there is always outliers.
[01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:41.020]   There are always outliers in that case.
[01:25:41.020 --> 01:25:45.020]   And another thought I had when you mentioned evo-devo.
[01:25:45.020 --> 01:25:49.580]   Evolution, development is also the Greek concepts
[01:25:49.580 --> 01:25:53.860]   of poiesis and pisis.
[01:25:53.860 --> 01:25:58.660]   The growing of the seed into the tree
[01:25:58.660 --> 01:26:03.580]   and the other process of the manufacturing
[01:26:03.580 --> 01:26:06.100]   of the chair from the tree.
[01:26:07.860 --> 01:26:12.860]   Two processes of development, evolution, very different.
[01:26:12.860 --> 01:26:15.820]   One from everything to something,
[01:26:15.820 --> 01:26:18.200]   the other from nothing to something.
[01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:22.060]   One is accumulation-based, one is subtraction-based.
[01:26:22.060 --> 01:26:26.220]   Both of these processes relate to collective knowledge,
[01:26:26.220 --> 01:26:29.600]   self-knowledge, but they're not exactly just that.
[01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:31.500]   And what should we do?
[01:26:31.500 --> 01:26:34.220]   This is a question that my friend Rasmus,
[01:26:34.220 --> 01:26:38.300]   he asks in his thesis and thoughts,
[01:26:38.300 --> 01:26:40.660]   what is the ultimate for us?
[01:26:40.660 --> 01:26:43.540]   Should we manufacture our chair
[01:26:43.540 --> 01:26:46.940]   or should we grow like into the tree?
[01:26:46.940 --> 01:26:49.900]   Civilize the mind, live savage the body.
[01:26:49.900 --> 01:26:54.540]   Is it in this way or should the mind also be left wild?
[01:26:54.540 --> 01:27:01.980]   Wild and wise is a nice combination of words
[01:27:01.980 --> 01:27:05.180]   that I like to place together, wild-wise.
[01:27:05.180 --> 01:27:09.220]   So, this is something that I try to bring into the way
[01:27:09.220 --> 01:27:10.980]   that I live my life and my practice.
[01:27:10.980 --> 01:27:15.980]   And I try to bring the information and the wisdom
[01:27:15.980 --> 01:27:20.560]   and the collective knowledge.
[01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:24.140]   But I also try to let go of more and more
[01:27:24.140 --> 01:27:28.420]   until an essence is gleaned, until something is appearing
[01:27:28.420 --> 01:27:31.060]   and because everything was already there.
[01:27:31.060 --> 01:27:34.360]   For example, if I'm sitting here,
[01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:40.640]   all the movements are already occurring.
[01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:46.720]   All the possibilities are, so it's just about,
[01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:48.720]   I need to open, I open this window,
[01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:49.860]   the air would come from here.
[01:27:49.860 --> 01:27:51.580]   If I open this window, the air would come.
[01:27:51.580 --> 01:27:53.580]   I don't need to drive my motion.
[01:27:53.580 --> 01:27:56.520]   I need to discover what is stopping it from happening.
[01:27:57.620 --> 01:28:01.660]   Something is constantly holding and when we remove this,
[01:28:01.660 --> 01:28:03.180]   immediately movement appears.
[01:28:03.180 --> 01:28:08.180]   This is real deep movement versus the driven movement
[01:28:08.180 --> 01:28:10.680]   that is very wasteful at times.
[01:28:10.680 --> 01:28:13.300]   Like walking, you see people pushing through the walk
[01:28:13.300 --> 01:28:17.020]   instead of the controlled falling that it should be.
[01:28:17.020 --> 01:28:23.340]   Fighting, punching, to manufacture the strength
[01:28:24.020 --> 01:28:28.860]   and then to have someone who knows how to facilitate
[01:28:28.860 --> 01:28:32.460]   the conditions in which you are knocked out.
[01:28:32.460 --> 01:28:34.160]   It doesn't knock you out.
[01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:38.220]   It hits versus I hit, like Bruce Lee said.
[01:28:38.220 --> 01:28:40.980]   So this is a beautiful thing to examine
[01:28:40.980 --> 01:28:42.340]   and to work within that.
[01:28:42.340 --> 01:28:46.500]   So to see, am I skateboarding?
[01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:51.500]   Am I using this perspective or am I trying to control
[01:28:51.620 --> 01:28:54.660]   because of risk and danger, I'm trying to overly control
[01:28:54.660 --> 01:28:57.220]   something that actually can never be controlled.
[01:28:57.220 --> 01:29:00.260]   The way to control it is to let go of the control
[01:29:00.260 --> 01:29:03.820]   and then okay, but what about all this collection
[01:29:03.820 --> 01:29:07.100]   of information, knowledge that I can bring in?
[01:29:07.100 --> 01:29:08.860]   Where do I wanna play?
[01:29:08.860 --> 01:29:11.980]   I can play down here or I can play up here.
[01:29:11.980 --> 01:29:15.060]   The collective knowledge is maybe take you further in
[01:29:15.060 --> 01:29:18.060]   and then you're still gonna need to do your individual work.
[01:29:18.060 --> 01:29:20.100]   A lot of people like to romanticize on that
[01:29:20.100 --> 01:29:24.300]   and you don't need teachers, we don't need nothing,
[01:29:24.300 --> 01:29:25.860]   we don't need information.
[01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:28.620]   It's not fully honest, you don't need,
[01:29:28.620 --> 01:29:31.140]   but depends on where you wanna function
[01:29:31.140 --> 01:29:32.400]   and how you wanna function.
[01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:33.860]   They shouldn't be demonized,
[01:29:33.860 --> 01:29:37.040]   but they shouldn't be overly glorified as well.
[01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:39.580]   - You mentioned about the opportunity for movement,
[01:29:39.580 --> 01:29:42.580]   perhaps even all forms of movement coming from deep within.
[01:29:42.580 --> 01:29:46.820]   It raises to mind in the neuroscience of motor systems,
[01:29:46.820 --> 01:29:49.100]   we talk about motor neurons, as I described,
[01:29:49.100 --> 01:29:52.700]   ones that actually evoke contraction of muscles.
[01:29:52.700 --> 01:29:55.020]   And then there's this category of neurons
[01:29:55.020 --> 01:29:58.100]   that isn't often discussed, but certainly exist,
[01:29:58.100 --> 01:30:01.620]   aren't often discussed in kind of popular nomenclature
[01:30:01.620 --> 01:30:04.500]   of neuroscience, which is the premotor system.
[01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:07.340]   Most of our movements are the reflection
[01:30:07.340 --> 01:30:12.020]   of certain patterns of transmission breaking through
[01:30:12.020 --> 01:30:14.880]   from the premotor to the actual motor.
[01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:19.600]   In other words, we are always in a anticipatory mode
[01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:23.600]   of movement, and I think you, the way you describe it,
[01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:26.040]   you clearly intuitively understand that you feel it
[01:30:26.040 --> 01:30:27.800]   and you recognize it.
[01:30:27.800 --> 01:30:30.120]   Think of it as, it's like a layer of neurons
[01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:33.400]   that's constantly humming, ready to go.
[01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:35.060]   And it's the release of these gates
[01:30:35.060 --> 01:30:37.800]   that allows movement to occur in a particular way.
[01:30:37.800 --> 01:30:40.360]   Could be very smooth, could be very ballistic.
[01:30:40.360 --> 01:30:44.020]   - Which is DNA, the same, turning off and on,
[01:30:44.020 --> 01:30:46.580]   but all the information's already there.
[01:30:46.580 --> 01:30:47.420]   - Right.
[01:30:47.420 --> 01:30:49.500]   - And then the possibilities are just allowed.
[01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:54.500]   So I'm allowed, I don't do free will already,
[01:30:54.500 --> 01:30:58.800]   but I am allowed to do.
[01:30:58.800 --> 01:31:01.660]   I am, there are possibilities,
[01:31:01.660 --> 01:31:06.660]   and I am dancing within that dance,
[01:31:06.660 --> 01:31:09.480]   but I am not the only dancer.
[01:31:09.480 --> 01:31:13.640]   So that's my sensation, at least with,
[01:31:14.640 --> 01:31:19.640]   most states of being, let's say.
[01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:25.160]   Maybe there is other states that could be reached,
[01:31:25.160 --> 01:31:28.960]   a stability that will arrive from the waters,
[01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:31.120]   from the movement of the waters.
[01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:35.620]   This humming, these potential possibilities,
[01:31:35.620 --> 01:31:38.760]   to be in that state, to vibrate like this,
[01:31:38.760 --> 01:31:41.360]   is very powerful for our lives.
[01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:45.180]   To wake up in the morning and feel that living thing
[01:31:45.180 --> 01:31:46.600]   is the feeling of movement,
[01:31:46.600 --> 01:31:48.980]   and for me it's a result of the practice.
[01:31:48.980 --> 01:31:53.080]   And so then it's easy not to stagnate,
[01:31:53.080 --> 01:31:55.440]   and then the mind can stay focused for hours,
[01:31:55.440 --> 01:31:59.520]   like we've done today, and I can listen and tune in,
[01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:02.020]   and I won't lose you, which is very difficult.
[01:32:02.020 --> 01:32:05.540]   Like I haven't had a good conversation here in the US.
[01:32:05.540 --> 01:32:08.280]   It's very difficult, and I've had your attention
[01:32:08.280 --> 01:32:10.320]   and your listening, but it's rare.
[01:32:10.320 --> 01:32:11.880]   It's rare that somebody can do that,
[01:32:11.880 --> 01:32:14.600]   and it's a struggle, always a struggle,
[01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:17.860]   but it's definitely my trick, my dirty trick.
[01:32:17.860 --> 01:32:21.040]   - You said you're allowed,
[01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:23.000]   and again, I'm taking some of the language
[01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.320]   and what you report about your experience,
[01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:27.960]   and I'm trying to map it to some concepts
[01:32:27.960 --> 01:32:29.640]   that relate to neural circuits.
[01:32:29.640 --> 01:32:32.520]   In the principles of neuroscience,
[01:32:32.520 --> 01:32:36.800]   we talk about instructiveness versus permissiveness.
[01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:38.940]   There are instructive cues, like for instance,
[01:32:38.940 --> 01:32:41.120]   the ability to pick up this pen, right?
[01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:44.960]   There's an instruction, clearly, there's a motor command,
[01:32:44.960 --> 01:32:46.780]   but that's just one way of looking at it.
[01:32:46.780 --> 01:32:49.720]   The way it actually works is that there's a premotor system
[01:32:49.720 --> 01:32:51.760]   that's already generating that movement,
[01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:53.680]   and what we've done is we flung open the gate
[01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:56.040]   and allowed that movement to occur precisely.
[01:32:56.040 --> 01:32:58.000]   - Surfing it. - Right.
[01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.160]   - Surfing that current, or this current,
[01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:02.560]   or another current, or opening the window.
[01:33:02.560 --> 01:33:07.180]   - Exactly, and if you look at the formal study
[01:33:07.180 --> 01:33:10.880]   of movement and improvement of movement,
[01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:13.880]   the most basic example I can give is like a tennis serve,
[01:33:13.880 --> 01:33:16.880]   and if you just, they've done this many times over,
[01:33:16.880 --> 01:33:19.260]   you map the trajectories, and in a novice,
[01:33:19.260 --> 01:33:21.000]   the lines are all over the place.
[01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.880]   It ends up looking more like a tangle
[01:33:23.880 --> 01:33:25.880]   of rubber band ball, right?
[01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:28.880]   Whereas in the Federer or the expert,
[01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:31.580]   you almost wonder if it's just one line being drawn,
[01:33:31.580 --> 01:33:35.000]   but the trajectories are incredibly stereotyped.
[01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.480]   That's the reflection of one little narrow gate opening
[01:33:37.480 --> 01:33:39.260]   again, and again, and again.
[01:33:39.260 --> 01:33:40.280]   Of course--
[01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:45.040]   - Let me inject something here from an old neurologist,
[01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:48.920]   you can say, Berenstain, the Soviet,
[01:33:48.920 --> 01:33:51.540]   and he talked about the degrees of freedom,
[01:33:51.540 --> 01:33:54.580]   and they did, in order to increase productivity
[01:33:54.580 --> 01:33:59.180]   in Soviet Union, I don't know if you've heard this story,
[01:33:59.180 --> 01:34:03.580]   he was brought in to examine the movement habits
[01:34:03.580 --> 01:34:08.580]   of the workers, and he collected some information.
[01:34:08.580 --> 01:34:12.500]   He placed, he was one of the first kinetic,
[01:34:12.500 --> 01:34:14.360]   I don't know how it's called in English,
[01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:17.580]   the kinetic capturing of motion
[01:34:17.580 --> 01:34:20.320]   with moving pictures in that time,
[01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:24.420]   and so he placed these dots, and they took these photos
[01:34:24.420 --> 01:34:26.680]   which became kind of moving,
[01:34:26.680 --> 01:34:30.180]   and what he discovered was something very interesting.
[01:34:30.180 --> 01:34:34.140]   The accuracy of the hit of the sledgehammer
[01:34:34.140 --> 01:34:40.900]   increased while the variance in the various points
[01:34:40.900 --> 01:34:46.020]   became more, not less, so it wasn't a fixed pattern,
[01:34:46.020 --> 01:34:50.700]   it was a meta-pattern, and this pattern is adjusted
[01:34:50.700 --> 01:34:55.820]   in this way to achieve the perfect execution.
[01:34:55.820 --> 01:34:57.380]   Those were very early findings.
[01:34:57.380 --> 01:35:00.740]   I'm not sure how does that sit with everything,
[01:35:00.740 --> 01:35:04.340]   but I'm sure there is some truth to it from my experience.
[01:35:04.340 --> 01:35:09.340]   Basically, the self-adjusting dynamic nature of the system
[01:35:09.340 --> 01:35:14.340]   allows you to reach a very constant and stable end result
[01:35:14.340 --> 01:35:19.480]   by being so open and letting go of your control.
[01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:22.980]   - The example you give fits very well
[01:35:22.980 --> 01:35:24.740]   with the one that I described before
[01:35:24.740 --> 01:35:26.580]   because I'm recalling the experiment,
[01:35:26.580 --> 01:35:28.220]   if people want to look this up, it's a paper,
[01:35:28.220 --> 01:35:29.860]   we'll put it in the show note caption,
[01:35:29.860 --> 01:35:32.140]   the guy also happens to be at Harvard
[01:35:32.140 --> 01:35:34.360]   named Bence Olavski, a Hungarian,
[01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:36.940]   I'm clearly pronouncing his name wrong, but I know Bence,
[01:35:36.940 --> 01:35:39.860]   and I remember the slide in my mind's eye,
[01:35:39.860 --> 01:35:41.180]   and the trajectory that was mapped
[01:35:41.180 --> 01:35:42.620]   was the movement of the tennis racket,
[01:35:42.620 --> 01:35:45.620]   not of the limbs themselves in the Federer case,
[01:35:45.620 --> 01:35:48.660]   so that I think aligns well with what you're describing.
[01:35:48.660 --> 01:35:51.240]   Yeah, that exploration of degrees of freedom
[01:35:51.240 --> 01:35:56.240]   is where the opportunity for real advancement
[01:35:56.620 --> 01:35:58.580]   and expansion of skill shows up.
[01:35:58.580 --> 01:35:59.920]   I think the way it's been described to me
[01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:03.280]   is that we go from unskilled to skilled,
[01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:05.720]   and then there's mastery, and then there's this top tier,
[01:36:05.720 --> 01:36:07.920]   which is this beautiful thin layer
[01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:10.680]   that so few people occupy, which is virtuosity,
[01:36:10.680 --> 01:36:13.860]   in which the practitioner invites variability
[01:36:13.860 --> 01:36:17.620]   and chance back in as an opportunity to do truly new things.
[01:36:17.620 --> 01:36:23.960]   - It made me think many years ago,
[01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:28.360]   this kind of thinking about, so what is that entity?
[01:36:28.360 --> 01:36:30.680]   Because obviously it's not technique,
[01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:32.360]   and it wouldn't even be honest to say
[01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:34.340]   it's a movement pattern.
[01:36:34.340 --> 01:36:37.120]   There is too much diversity there.
[01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:39.160]   I started to talk about, I called it
[01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:42.080]   movement sleeves, or metatechnique,
[01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:46.280]   but the word technique is already misleading.
[01:36:46.280 --> 01:36:51.440]   So there is some kind of a dynamic sleeve
[01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:54.800]   in which you can move, as long as you're not
[01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:58.200]   out of this sleeve, you're still within the boundaries
[01:36:58.200 --> 01:37:01.740]   of achieving the result that you're after.
[01:37:01.740 --> 01:37:04.500]   And then there is all this adaptation
[01:37:04.500 --> 01:37:07.760]   of all these elements inside to keep you in the sleeve.
[01:37:07.760 --> 01:37:11.320]   The sleeve is not constricted as we once thought.
[01:37:11.320 --> 01:37:13.320]   Oh, beautiful technique.
[01:37:13.320 --> 01:37:15.660]   There are many ways to skin a cat.
[01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:21.880]   And that experience and that variety, that diversity
[01:37:21.880 --> 01:37:23.420]   goes into virtuosity.
[01:37:23.420 --> 01:37:27.620]   It's true freedom, because your focus is on the right thing.
[01:37:27.620 --> 01:37:30.460]   You don't point at the moon, look at your finger.
[01:37:30.460 --> 01:37:35.120]   And that's really in essence being a virtuoso for me,
[01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:38.340]   like mastery, let's say, if there is such a thing.
[01:37:38.340 --> 01:37:41.060]   - I do believe there is such a thing,
[01:37:41.060 --> 01:37:44.080]   and I'll flatter and attempt to embarrass you
[01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:45.560]   by saying I think that I'm not alone
[01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:47.640]   in viewing you as a virtuoso movement.
[01:37:47.640 --> 01:37:50.240]   I think that's what comes to mind,
[01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:52.840]   because there's this notion that not everything
[01:37:52.840 --> 01:37:56.140]   is pre-planned, that even you might not know
[01:37:56.140 --> 01:37:59.020]   what you're going to do next until the moment of execution.
[01:37:59.020 --> 01:38:02.560]   But that here I'm projecting my own assumptions.
[01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:07.920]   I'd like to talk about mindsets
[01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:10.920]   in approaching practice a little bit more,
[01:38:10.920 --> 01:38:13.680]   but I want to wade into that territory
[01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:16.780]   by talking about vision in the eyes,
[01:38:16.780 --> 01:38:19.300]   something that we both share a deep interest in.
[01:38:19.300 --> 01:38:21.520]   I, from the background of visual neuroscience,
[01:38:21.520 --> 01:38:24.540]   but also from the realization that we have
[01:38:24.540 --> 01:38:26.640]   this incredible ability to adjust the aperture
[01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:27.680]   of our visual window.
[01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:31.400]   We can focus very narrowly, and we can focus very broadly.
[01:38:31.400 --> 01:38:33.560]   So something I encountered, I think, first as a child,
[01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:36.940]   realizing that I could spend all day watching ants play
[01:38:36.940 --> 01:38:39.900]   in a very fine domain and then look up and go inside
[01:38:39.900 --> 01:38:41.320]   and realize there's a whole world.
[01:38:41.320 --> 01:38:44.920]   And realizing, wow, I'll never be able to consume
[01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:48.580]   the full range of experiences at any one moment.
[01:38:48.580 --> 01:38:50.740]   There are ants probably in the corner of this room
[01:38:50.740 --> 01:38:51.700]   doing their thing.
[01:38:51.700 --> 01:38:56.240]   And so too, our approach to movement can be,
[01:38:56.240 --> 01:38:58.100]   as you mentioned, very big and dynamic
[01:38:58.100 --> 01:39:00.400]   in terms of the broad movements of our limbs
[01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:02.240]   or fine articulation.
[01:39:02.240 --> 01:39:04.520]   When you begin a practice,
[01:39:04.520 --> 01:39:06.580]   and as you move through a practice,
[01:39:06.580 --> 01:39:11.580]   do you apply a regimented way of focusing your vision?
[01:39:11.580 --> 01:39:14.340]   Are you in panoramic vision?
[01:39:14.340 --> 01:39:16.660]   Are you in a very narrow field of view,
[01:39:16.660 --> 01:39:18.480]   or does it entirely depend?
[01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:20.520]   And for the person who's a true beginner,
[01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:22.480]   a true novice like myself,
[01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:25.780]   how should I show up to the practice with my eyes?
[01:39:25.780 --> 01:39:29.860]   - The eyes are a good starting point
[01:39:29.860 --> 01:39:33.580]   as you help a lot of people to understand.
[01:39:33.580 --> 01:39:37.300]   And when you encounter difficulties with other layers,
[01:39:37.300 --> 01:39:39.940]   it's very powerful to start with the eyes.
[01:39:39.940 --> 01:39:44.120]   Another thing important to understand and to experience,
[01:39:44.120 --> 01:39:49.120]   you can't believe me or you gotta examine it for yourself,
[01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:54.440]   we do not move the eyes as well as we think we do.
[01:39:54.440 --> 01:39:57.620]   'Cause as long as you can see and move the eyes,
[01:39:57.620 --> 01:40:01.200]   people never think about it, that it can be trained,
[01:40:01.200 --> 01:40:03.320]   that it can be improved, et cetera.
[01:40:03.320 --> 01:40:06.300]   And the effects of it are far-reaching.
[01:40:06.300 --> 01:40:09.960]   The eyes lead to the inner eye.
[01:40:09.960 --> 01:40:12.980]   You can think of it in a beautiful metaphorical way.
[01:40:12.980 --> 01:40:18.560]   And it's a representation of the way
[01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:23.560]   that we use various cognitive and mind processes,
[01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:25.900]   and also of course affect the body.
[01:40:25.900 --> 01:40:31.860]   The eyes lead in many ways, and the head is also a very,
[01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:36.480]   because all of these inputs are coming in here,
[01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:38.960]   so it's very easy to lead the body in a,
[01:40:38.960 --> 01:40:41.560]   if you look at the centered way, from the head.
[01:40:41.560 --> 01:40:43.520]   It's a very powerful and easy thing.
[01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:47.900]   For example, when you teach boxers how to bob,
[01:40:47.900 --> 01:40:50.580]   usually it's not done in the way
[01:40:50.580 --> 01:40:53.880]   that I believe it should be done.
[01:40:53.880 --> 01:40:56.320]   You teach it with the periphery.
[01:40:56.320 --> 01:40:58.540]   They teach it from the feet.
[01:40:58.540 --> 01:41:00.560]   Because they have the idea, which is correct,
[01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:04.440]   that you need to do it in spatial conditions,
[01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:07.280]   in movement, in space.
[01:41:07.280 --> 01:41:10.120]   But in reality, the head will organize the feet for you.
[01:41:10.120 --> 01:41:14.040]   Instead, you are now putting two elements together,
[01:41:14.040 --> 01:41:15.600]   and then with years of practice,
[01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:18.100]   you hope of tying them together well.
[01:41:18.100 --> 01:41:19.440]   I prefer to do something else,
[01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:21.740]   because if I'll pull your head now to the side,
[01:41:21.740 --> 01:41:25.960]   you will immediately start to organize your feet under you.
[01:41:25.960 --> 01:41:28.840]   So I give you just one element to manipulate the system from.
[01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:32.120]   That's how I would teach someone something like this.
[01:41:32.120 --> 01:41:34.280]   Many animals hunt with the head.
[01:41:34.280 --> 01:41:36.400]   So you can see the body running forward
[01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:38.200]   while the head is turning to the side.
[01:41:38.200 --> 01:41:40.240]   The whole thing follows afterwards.
[01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:42.440]   So it's a very powerful way to address movement.
[01:41:42.440 --> 01:41:43.440]   Not the only one.
[01:41:43.440 --> 01:41:45.980]   There are many modes, thankfully,
[01:41:45.980 --> 01:41:47.620]   and we're very adaptable in that,
[01:41:47.620 --> 01:41:50.240]   but definitely a primary one.
[01:41:50.240 --> 01:41:52.540]   And then the use of the eyes is, of course,
[01:41:52.540 --> 01:41:55.920]   maybe the most important element with that, usually.
[01:41:55.920 --> 01:42:00.920]   Eh, yeah, what else can I say about the eyes?
[01:42:00.920 --> 01:42:03.040]   How do you come in?
[01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:04.540]   Well, it depends on the practice.
[01:42:04.540 --> 01:42:08.400]   You need to start to have some kind of a checklist
[01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:11.240]   of what you're looking to do.
[01:42:11.240 --> 01:42:13.600]   And then by this, you can start to tailor
[01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:15.880]   the way that you use your eyes.
[01:42:15.880 --> 01:42:18.280]   The same thing I do for posture.
[01:42:18.280 --> 01:42:20.160]   The same thing I do for stance.
[01:42:20.160 --> 01:42:22.560]   The same thing, eventually, I do for state.
[01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:25.040]   And there is different flavors.
[01:42:25.040 --> 01:42:26.840]   There is no correct way to use the eyes.
[01:42:26.840 --> 01:42:28.520]   Sometimes it's very peripheral,
[01:42:28.520 --> 01:42:31.840]   soft, open, awareness orientation.
[01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:33.720]   Sometimes it's very focused.
[01:42:33.720 --> 01:42:38.340]   Notice that I'm pulling these two opposites,
[01:42:38.340 --> 01:42:41.800]   awareness and focus, which is often put together
[01:42:41.800 --> 01:42:43.080]   and confused, but...
[01:42:43.080 --> 01:42:47.880]   And then the eyes are the immediate
[01:42:47.880 --> 01:42:51.360]   and the easiest entry point into that.
[01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:55.420]   Another thing is the placement of the head and the eyes.
[01:42:55.420 --> 01:42:59.120]   Like, for example, when we lower our chin,
[01:42:59.120 --> 01:43:01.600]   we seem to see better.
[01:43:01.600 --> 01:43:06.600]   When we raise the eyebrows, there is too much exposure
[01:43:06.600 --> 01:43:09.920]   of top light sources, and so people would usually,
[01:43:09.920 --> 01:43:11.180]   when looking into the distance,
[01:43:11.180 --> 01:43:13.360]   will tilt their chin in.
[01:43:13.360 --> 01:43:17.160]   And in many scenarios, tilting of the chin to the side
[01:43:17.160 --> 01:43:20.840]   or placing, just like listening with the ear,
[01:43:20.840 --> 01:43:23.720]   placing a certain eye or dominant eye,
[01:43:23.720 --> 01:43:26.480]   depending on various scenarios.
[01:43:26.480 --> 01:43:30.080]   And this is all like information that I can come in
[01:43:30.080 --> 01:43:34.720]   cerebrally and think about and jump my practice forward.
[01:43:34.720 --> 01:43:38.520]   Instead of just letting the experience teach me that,
[01:43:38.520 --> 01:43:41.360]   I'm using some kind of a thinking process to improve.
[01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:44.440]   And this is not cheating, this is great.
[01:43:44.440 --> 01:43:45.480]   Will it work?
[01:43:45.480 --> 01:43:46.640]   We gotta try.
[01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:48.920]   It's a process.
[01:43:48.920 --> 01:43:51.620]   Those are some thoughts to start to play with.
[01:43:51.620 --> 01:43:52.640]   - Yeah.
[01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:56.080]   I love that you mentioned chin down,
[01:43:56.080 --> 01:43:58.560]   because we all have a natural reflex when chin goes down,
[01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:01.400]   eyes goes up, and the opposite is true when head goes up,
[01:44:01.400 --> 01:44:03.280]   eyes go down.
[01:44:03.280 --> 01:44:05.560]   And there are two separate clusters of neurons
[01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:09.280]   in these cranial nerve nuclei that, as we call them,
[01:44:09.280 --> 01:44:14.520]   when eyes are up, it increases our level of alertness.
[01:44:14.520 --> 01:44:18.040]   Overall, this is not, you know, this is not woo science.
[01:44:18.040 --> 01:44:22.080]   This is the function of these cranial nerve nuclei.
[01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:24.520]   When our eyes are down,
[01:44:24.520 --> 01:44:27.280]   we go into states of more calm and quiescence.
[01:44:27.280 --> 01:44:28.520]   And this makes perfect sense, you know,
[01:44:28.520 --> 01:44:29.960]   and then the eyelids usually go down
[01:44:29.960 --> 01:44:31.560]   and then people fall asleep.
[01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:34.320]   Eyes up does not mean head up, 'cause as you said,
[01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:36.980]   there's a very dynamic control over the amount of luminance,
[01:44:36.980 --> 01:44:38.400]   depending on the environment.
[01:44:38.400 --> 01:44:41.320]   So that, and then as you mentioned,
[01:44:41.320 --> 01:44:43.840]   this difference between focus and awareness,
[01:44:43.840 --> 01:44:46.140]   I think is a really important one.
[01:44:46.140 --> 01:44:48.820]   When we are in this more panoramic soft gaze
[01:44:48.820 --> 01:44:53.820]   and broad awareness, big swaths of visual field, as we say,
[01:44:53.820 --> 01:44:56.200]   the neurons that control that come through a pathway
[01:44:56.200 --> 01:44:57.420]   called magnocellular pathway.
[01:44:57.420 --> 01:44:59.460]   In any event, those neurons are much thicker,
[01:44:59.460 --> 01:45:00.300]   thicker cables.
[01:45:00.300 --> 01:45:03.100]   They transmit much faster, just like thick pipes
[01:45:03.100 --> 01:45:05.540]   can carry more water more quickly.
[01:45:05.540 --> 01:45:09.260]   And your reaction time is at least four times
[01:45:09.260 --> 01:45:11.740]   what it is in this awareness mode
[01:45:11.740 --> 01:45:14.080]   than it is when you're narrowly focused on something.
[01:45:14.080 --> 01:45:16.440]   And this is counterintuitive, I think, to a lot of people,
[01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:18.240]   but the person who is running to catch the ball
[01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:21.620]   is not tracking the ball in a smooth movement.
[01:45:21.620 --> 01:45:23.480]   Most of their vision is in peripheral vision.
[01:45:23.480 --> 01:45:25.680]   When we drive, we're in this peripheral vision
[01:45:25.680 --> 01:45:28.480]   and our reaction times are much, much faster.
[01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:32.660]   So I don't know if I'm reluctant to encourage people
[01:45:32.660 --> 01:45:34.940]   to shift toward a particular type of practice,
[01:45:34.940 --> 01:45:36.120]   toward a particular type of vision.
[01:45:36.120 --> 01:45:40.280]   I think what you and I, I hope agree on,
[01:45:40.280 --> 01:45:41.120]   correct me if I'm wrong,
[01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:44.560]   is that exploring these different extremes
[01:45:44.560 --> 01:45:46.920]   and everything in between is where the real value is.
[01:45:46.920 --> 01:45:49.160]   Panoramic focused.
[01:45:49.160 --> 01:45:52.200]   Eyes, head up, eyes down, head down, eyes up.
[01:45:52.200 --> 01:45:54.120]   Playing with it and exploring it
[01:45:54.120 --> 01:45:58.800]   as opposed to, for the first 10 minutes of practice,
[01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:00.000]   being panoramic vision.
[01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:03.000]   You know, the sort of earlier today we were joking about
[01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.360]   and kind of lamenting the fact
[01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:07.440]   that this word biohacking exists
[01:46:07.440 --> 01:46:09.800]   or that the optimal performance.
[01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:11.160]   There are unfortunate terms
[01:46:11.160 --> 01:46:13.520]   because they suggest that if you just plug it in,
[01:46:13.520 --> 01:46:15.120]   it's going to be like two plus two equals four
[01:46:15.120 --> 01:46:17.560]   and you're going to get it right every time.
[01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:20.360]   - Another pragmatic bit here if I can offer
[01:46:20.360 --> 01:46:25.360]   is since our culture has been more geared
[01:46:25.360 --> 01:46:28.940]   than pushing us towards focus,
[01:46:28.940 --> 01:46:32.040]   the focus use of the eyes and primary language reading
[01:46:32.040 --> 01:46:36.560]   and other things, we have less opportunities
[01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:39.600]   to work with the more open panoramic one.
[01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:42.200]   So it would be smart to start
[01:46:42.200 --> 01:46:45.580]   to balance things out a bit more.
[01:46:45.580 --> 01:46:48.800]   When you're in nature, you don't look at each leaf.
[01:46:48.800 --> 01:46:52.300]   Everything is moving and you are kind of immersed in that
[01:46:52.300 --> 01:46:54.000]   and then something attracts your attention.
[01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:55.160]   Oh, it's a bird.
[01:46:55.160 --> 01:46:59.160]   And you focus and you go back into the general state,
[01:46:59.160 --> 01:47:02.800]   the basic state, which is open awareness.
[01:47:02.800 --> 01:47:05.820]   Here, we switch things around in our modern culture.
[01:47:05.820 --> 01:47:10.120]   We are mostly focused and then we sanitize daydream,
[01:47:10.120 --> 01:47:12.540]   which is maybe some kind of a,
[01:47:12.540 --> 01:47:17.520]   some kind of a balancing act that comes from deep within.
[01:47:17.520 --> 01:47:18.680]   I don't know.
[01:47:18.680 --> 01:47:21.280]   Maybe you can share some information about that.
[01:47:21.280 --> 01:47:24.440]   But I see that many times people need to,
[01:47:24.440 --> 01:47:29.440]   the focus is overly done by far in our lives.
[01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:30.820]   - I couldn't agree more.
[01:47:30.820 --> 01:47:33.360]   And I think a lot of, I'll even venture so far as to say
[01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:37.140]   that a lot of the visual deficits that we now see
[01:47:37.140 --> 01:47:41.360]   in young people, myopia, literally nearsightedness occurs,
[01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:43.520]   because if we look at things that are too close to us,
[01:47:43.520 --> 01:47:46.800]   as children or as adults, the eyeball actually gets longer.
[01:47:46.800 --> 01:47:51.640]   The lens focuses the visual image in front of nearer
[01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:53.240]   to the lens, nearsighted,
[01:47:53.240 --> 01:47:56.720]   then in front of where it should land.
[01:47:56.720 --> 01:48:01.720]   And basically it's a lack of panoramic vision that is,
[01:48:01.900 --> 01:48:04.540]   or open awareness that's driving these changes.
[01:48:04.540 --> 01:48:06.840]   And nowadays we are essentially,
[01:48:06.840 --> 01:48:11.140]   most people are 90% of the time in this narrow focus mode.
[01:48:11.140 --> 01:48:12.060]   Right before recording,
[01:48:12.060 --> 01:48:14.360]   we took a break and went up to look at a vista
[01:48:14.360 --> 01:48:15.600]   and to look off to the distance.
[01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:19.700]   Incredibly useful, easy practice at some level,
[01:48:19.700 --> 01:48:22.200]   but I think most people are not doing this sort of thing.
[01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:23.940]   And the way that it shapes the mind
[01:48:23.940 --> 01:48:25.520]   and the perception of time, of course,
[01:48:25.520 --> 01:48:28.320]   is a whole other kingdom of ideas.
[01:48:28.320 --> 01:48:32.720]   But one thing I'd like to relate this element of vision to
[01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:34.200]   and open awareness is earlier,
[01:48:34.200 --> 01:48:36.500]   you mentioned the cone of auditory attention,
[01:48:36.500 --> 01:48:40.880]   the other sense that we can play with as in our practice
[01:48:40.880 --> 01:48:42.380]   and throughout the day.
[01:48:42.380 --> 01:48:47.560]   Do you see any value to both paying attention to things
[01:48:47.560 --> 01:48:49.580]   in a very narrow cone of auditory attention,
[01:48:49.580 --> 01:48:51.840]   but also just walking and listening
[01:48:51.840 --> 01:48:53.680]   to all the sounds at once?
[01:48:53.680 --> 01:48:55.320]   I could imagine that could be useful.
[01:48:55.320 --> 01:48:58.620]   And in terms of physical movement practices,
[01:48:58.620 --> 01:49:00.240]   I was going to say, where are your ears?
[01:49:00.240 --> 01:49:02.040]   Your ears are always more or less in the same place,
[01:49:02.040 --> 01:49:06.280]   but where is your hearing when you approach your practice?
[01:49:06.280 --> 01:49:09.600]   - Another set of parameters to think about
[01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:11.840]   and to play with and to be aware of.
[01:49:11.840 --> 01:49:17.400]   Also, I have the experience that some people are
[01:49:17.400 --> 01:49:22.480]   better at using this system or that system.
[01:49:22.480 --> 01:49:27.480]   And you would be amazed how differently the same results,
[01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:28.960]   seemingly outside results,
[01:49:28.960 --> 01:49:30.880]   are done by different practitioners
[01:49:30.880 --> 01:49:32.240]   and in different scenarios.
[01:49:32.240 --> 01:49:38.380]   This goes into this mutation and change ideas.
[01:49:38.380 --> 01:49:40.840]   What really jumps us forward eventually
[01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:42.720]   is some kind of a mutation.
[01:49:42.720 --> 01:49:47.280]   So it's like all of our culture and practices and success
[01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:50.120]   puts us closer and closer to each other.
[01:49:50.120 --> 01:49:54.380]   So we have the same opinions everywhere around the world
[01:49:54.380 --> 01:49:58.620]   becoming more and more the same, less and less different.
[01:49:58.620 --> 01:50:02.440]   But the real hope comes from the different.
[01:50:02.440 --> 01:50:07.440]   So, and we have a difficulty in promoting that.
[01:50:07.440 --> 01:50:13.360]   So this is another thing that can be promoted
[01:50:13.360 --> 01:50:16.420]   with the right practices, the right...
[01:50:16.420 --> 01:50:19.260]   For example, I work with corporates
[01:50:19.260 --> 01:50:22.080]   or even worked with governments before
[01:50:22.080 --> 01:50:24.040]   to bring in some of that freshness
[01:50:24.040 --> 01:50:26.560]   with simple habits in the workday
[01:50:26.560 --> 01:50:31.560]   or in the education of children or in companies,
[01:50:31.560 --> 01:50:34.680]   increasing productivity.
[01:50:34.680 --> 01:50:36.660]   I don't really give a fuck,
[01:50:36.660 --> 01:50:41.280]   but I am there to give what I view is important.
[01:50:41.280 --> 01:50:45.080]   And what is important maybe increases productivity,
[01:50:45.080 --> 01:50:47.200]   but it's more important to me
[01:50:47.200 --> 01:50:50.420]   that it improves people's lives who are involved
[01:50:50.420 --> 01:50:55.420]   and improves being and becoming,
[01:50:55.420 --> 01:50:59.160]   being and becoming these two entities.
[01:50:59.160 --> 01:51:00.720]   I'm not there.
[01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:01.760]   I'm on my way.
[01:51:01.760 --> 01:51:02.880]   I'm a process.
[01:51:02.880 --> 01:51:06.700]   So thinking about hearing,
[01:51:06.700 --> 01:51:09.040]   the way that people use their ears,
[01:51:09.040 --> 01:51:10.920]   the way that people use listening.
[01:51:10.920 --> 01:51:15.520]   Again, we can talk about placement of the head and posture.
[01:51:16.960 --> 01:51:19.080]   Sometimes angling as well,
[01:51:19.080 --> 01:51:20.680]   sharper angle, chin down.
[01:51:20.680 --> 01:51:24.760]   Some people tend to use the shape of the ear.
[01:51:24.760 --> 01:51:28.840]   People with different ears closer or further out.
[01:51:28.840 --> 01:51:30.460]   This is...
[01:51:30.460 --> 01:51:32.320]   If you're very sensitive and you're looking around,
[01:51:32.320 --> 01:51:37.240]   you would see this is affecting people's motion.
[01:51:37.240 --> 01:51:39.320]   Even the shape of our face,
[01:51:39.320 --> 01:51:43.180]   like the development of the vocal cords and speaking
[01:51:43.180 --> 01:51:46.280]   will totally change how we look,
[01:51:46.280 --> 01:51:51.200]   but how we listen also will do the same.
[01:51:51.200 --> 01:51:52.520]   I don't have any proof of it,
[01:51:52.520 --> 01:51:56.560]   but it is something I believe in.
[01:51:56.560 --> 01:51:59.160]   - Well, people will even make their ears bigger, right?
[01:51:59.160 --> 01:52:03.160]   We try and become like little fennec foxes or something by...
[01:52:03.160 --> 01:52:04.160]   I mean, a lot of people don't realize
[01:52:04.160 --> 01:52:05.260]   that's actually why we do this
[01:52:05.260 --> 01:52:07.360]   is to capture more sound waves, right?
[01:52:07.360 --> 01:52:10.040]   And the leaning is that the localization of sound
[01:52:10.040 --> 01:52:12.200]   is based on a simple brainstem calculation
[01:52:12.200 --> 01:52:14.360]   of inter-oral time differences.
[01:52:14.360 --> 01:52:16.320]   The time in which something...
[01:52:16.320 --> 01:52:19.040]   The brain intuitively, it just knows,
[01:52:19.040 --> 01:52:20.860]   'cause it's a pretty hardwired circuit,
[01:52:20.860 --> 01:52:23.440]   that if a sound arrives first to this ear, then that ear,
[01:52:23.440 --> 01:52:26.500]   that it's likely coming from over here.
[01:52:26.500 --> 01:52:28.160]   Whereas if it's dead center,
[01:52:28.160 --> 01:52:30.640]   arrives at the two at the same time.
[01:52:30.640 --> 01:52:33.400]   It's almost ridiculously simple when one hears it,
[01:52:33.400 --> 01:52:34.480]   no pun intended,
[01:52:34.480 --> 01:52:39.480]   but it is an incredibly valuable way of thinking
[01:52:39.480 --> 01:52:42.520]   about how the architecture of the body
[01:52:42.520 --> 01:52:44.760]   changes our experience.
[01:52:44.760 --> 01:52:46.560]   I went along those lines earlier,
[01:52:46.560 --> 01:52:48.920]   you mentioned something and it flagged
[01:52:48.920 --> 01:52:50.420]   an important question for me.
[01:52:50.420 --> 01:52:54.520]   When I see people walking,
[01:52:54.520 --> 01:52:56.860]   sometimes I think,
[01:52:56.860 --> 01:52:59.280]   "Wow, they really move in a strange way."
[01:52:59.280 --> 01:53:01.700]   Occasionally you see somebody, they walk really...
[01:53:01.700 --> 01:53:04.240]   It's impressive for whatever reason.
[01:53:04.240 --> 01:53:07.500]   And you just think, "Wow, they sort of glide along."
[01:53:07.500 --> 01:53:09.280]   People come in different shapes and sizes,
[01:53:09.280 --> 01:53:11.680]   short torsos, long arms, et cetera.
[01:53:12.240 --> 01:53:16.200]   Do you think that if people have a body type
[01:53:16.200 --> 01:53:19.320]   that facilitates certain kinds of movement and not others,
[01:53:19.320 --> 01:53:22.840]   that they should intentionally try and move in the way
[01:53:22.840 --> 01:53:26.220]   that is right at the edge of the kind of friction
[01:53:26.220 --> 01:53:31.220]   and challenge in order to shape new possibilities?
[01:53:31.220 --> 01:53:33.120]   Or do you think that they should lean
[01:53:33.120 --> 01:53:34.860]   into the smooth execution
[01:53:34.860 --> 01:53:36.720]   of what comes most naturally to them?
[01:53:37.660 --> 01:53:41.700]   Yeah, I think a good practice is to have many walks
[01:53:41.700 --> 01:53:47.460]   because they're required.
[01:53:47.460 --> 01:53:49.820]   Of course, there is a very efficient
[01:53:49.820 --> 01:53:52.780]   and endurance stamina-oriented thing
[01:53:52.780 --> 01:53:54.900]   that if you have the experience,
[01:53:54.900 --> 01:53:57.580]   it will naturally develop and unravel.
[01:53:57.580 --> 01:54:00.940]   And if not, you can get some collective knowledge
[01:54:00.940 --> 01:54:01.900]   and improve.
[01:54:01.900 --> 01:54:06.900]   And then there is a lot of emotional things related to walk,
[01:54:07.460 --> 01:54:10.340]   like how I'm walking into a business meeting
[01:54:10.340 --> 01:54:18.080]   or how I'm walking out of a bad situation.
[01:54:18.080 --> 01:54:24.260]   And there is a lot of beautiful things to research there,
[01:54:24.260 --> 01:54:27.220]   practically with yourself, trying to approach someone
[01:54:27.220 --> 01:54:30.580]   with the chin slightly down, very linear, very efficient,
[01:54:30.580 --> 01:54:33.540]   in the straightest line, or trying to approach someone
[01:54:33.540 --> 01:54:36.060]   a little bit more rounded from the side
[01:54:36.060 --> 01:54:37.680]   and tilting your head.
[01:54:37.680 --> 01:54:40.500]   And you will see totally different results,
[01:54:40.500 --> 01:54:42.100]   totally different communication
[01:54:42.100 --> 01:54:45.060]   that happens over people's heads.
[01:54:45.060 --> 01:54:47.260]   But if you're sensitive, you realize that,
[01:54:47.260 --> 01:54:49.180]   wow, this opened the door.
[01:54:49.180 --> 01:54:52.140]   Many people, you start on the minus.
[01:54:52.140 --> 01:54:54.580]   My sister, my big sister, Tali, she always says,
[01:54:54.580 --> 01:54:56.500]   I started on the minus.
[01:54:56.500 --> 01:54:58.920]   Why don't I start on the zero with them?
[01:54:58.920 --> 01:55:02.580]   But it's part of the approach.
[01:55:02.580 --> 01:55:03.540]   You can affect that.
[01:55:03.540 --> 01:55:08.420]   And you can start even on the plus if you are the sly man,
[01:55:08.420 --> 01:55:10.580]   as the practitioner needs to be.
[01:55:10.580 --> 01:55:14.260]   So this is something to play with and to work with.
[01:55:14.260 --> 01:55:17.060]   And then you have, of course, body proportions and ways.
[01:55:17.060 --> 01:55:20.480]   And we have all these like technical invasions,
[01:55:20.480 --> 01:55:23.540]   mathematics and trigonometry and architecture,
[01:55:23.540 --> 01:55:27.220]   they invaded our bodies, they invaded our nervous system.
[01:55:27.220 --> 01:55:30.040]   And now our walk and our physical practices,
[01:55:30.040 --> 01:55:34.040]   they look linear and efficient, the path between two points
[01:55:34.040 --> 01:55:35.420]   is a straight line, it's not.
[01:55:35.420 --> 01:55:37.920]   This is biomechanics, it's not mechanics.
[01:55:37.920 --> 01:55:42.920]   Nothing there is given, there's no gospel.
[01:55:42.920 --> 01:55:47.360]   So the walk is sometimes have to go around
[01:55:47.360 --> 01:55:50.600]   or sway from side to side and there is coiling, uncoiling,
[01:55:50.600 --> 01:55:51.640]   and there are moving bits.
[01:55:51.640 --> 01:55:54.520]   And what about the coordination of my breathing
[01:55:54.520 --> 01:55:55.360]   with my walk?
[01:55:55.360 --> 01:55:57.360]   Because if I walk too linearly,
[01:55:57.360 --> 01:56:00.300]   there is less pumping of the air naturally in and out.
[01:56:00.300 --> 01:56:03.260]   So now I have to forcefully bring it in and out,
[01:56:03.260 --> 01:56:04.880]   I'm wasteful.
[01:56:04.880 --> 01:56:07.720]   And that's why you see in last years,
[01:56:07.720 --> 01:56:12.000]   these incredible runners, especially in long distance,
[01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:16.360]   doing things we never thought were possible
[01:56:16.360 --> 01:56:21.360]   in the worst possible way that we used to think.
[01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:24.000]   Pronation and all kinds of things,
[01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:29.000]   like our technical thoughts were totally misguided and wrong.
[01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:35.940]   And then somebody comes in and does it in some way
[01:56:35.940 --> 01:56:40.600]   that is totally wrong and he gets results we could never get.
[01:56:40.600 --> 01:56:44.240]   That's the beauty of playfulness, experimentation,
[01:56:44.240 --> 01:56:46.120]   change, being different.
[01:56:46.120 --> 01:56:49.460]   - As you're describing this, I'm smiling
[01:56:49.460 --> 01:56:52.240]   because one of my favorite neuroscientists,
[01:56:52.240 --> 01:56:55.960]   he's out of the University of Chicago, was in a meeting.
[01:56:55.960 --> 01:56:58.200]   There was an argument about evolution of the nervous system
[01:56:58.200 --> 01:57:01.820]   and he said at the end, and people were arguing
[01:57:01.820 --> 01:57:03.920]   about whether or not this gene in one animal
[01:57:03.920 --> 01:57:06.280]   was homologous to this gene in humans, et cetera.
[01:57:06.280 --> 01:57:07.920]   It can get very dicey.
[01:57:07.920 --> 01:57:12.920]   And he said very appropriately that one of the major jobs
[01:57:12.920 --> 01:57:16.140]   of evolution is to take existing cell types and circuits
[01:57:16.140 --> 01:57:17.720]   and give them new functions.
[01:57:17.720 --> 01:57:21.420]   But that can only be done through the playful exploration
[01:57:21.420 --> 01:57:24.520]   of new possibilities, which I think maps very well
[01:57:24.520 --> 01:57:27.880]   to what you're saying, that at the extreme thresholds
[01:57:27.880 --> 01:57:32.240]   of technical execution, mastery, mastery, mastery,
[01:57:32.240 --> 01:57:34.900]   your obviously performance is very high,
[01:57:34.900 --> 01:57:37.680]   but the opportunity for evolution of the sport
[01:57:37.680 --> 01:57:40.720]   or the music or the dance or the intellectual endeavor
[01:57:40.720 --> 01:57:44.020]   is limited because you're not introducing variability.
[01:57:44.020 --> 01:57:46.760]   In the attempt to get proper execution,
[01:57:46.760 --> 01:57:49.000]   you're limiting oneself.
[01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:53.140]   Hence, I want to offer something that is relating to you.
[01:57:53.140 --> 01:57:56.800]   We should be wary of
[01:57:56.800 --> 01:58:01.500]   defining the mechanisms
[01:58:01.500 --> 01:58:08.540]   and putting certain meaning with certain processes and ways
[01:58:08.540 --> 01:58:11.540]   because just history and experience shows
[01:58:11.540 --> 01:58:15.160]   it doesn't work well for us most times.
[01:58:15.160 --> 01:58:18.600]   Or it becomes like this much more elaborate thing,
[01:58:18.600 --> 01:58:22.520]   even if we were somewhat in the right direction.
[01:58:22.520 --> 01:58:26.120]   Because even thinking this way can offer a lot.
[01:58:26.120 --> 01:58:30.480]   Like for example, your advice about heat, dopamine, light,
[01:58:30.480 --> 01:58:34.440]   offers a lot of benefit but also can create problems.
[01:58:34.440 --> 01:58:38.400]   And it can enclose something,
[01:58:38.400 --> 01:58:43.360]   which the improviser will find,
[01:58:43.360 --> 01:58:44.680]   the MacGyvers, right?
[01:58:44.680 --> 01:58:49.520]   Like take some paperclip and you make it
[01:58:49.520 --> 01:58:51.140]   into something great.
[01:58:51.140 --> 01:58:53.160]   And this is really our,
[01:58:53.160 --> 01:58:56.360]   we are the biggest improvisers around.
[01:58:56.360 --> 01:58:58.360]   Like that's what made us who we are.
[01:58:58.360 --> 01:59:01.360]   I think this is incredible what we can do with it.
[01:59:01.360 --> 01:59:07.460]   You know the Russian-American space exploration story
[01:59:07.460 --> 01:59:10.160]   with the space pen, famous story,
[01:59:10.160 --> 01:59:12.800]   about the development of the space pen.
[01:59:12.800 --> 01:59:14.040]   - No, it's a space pen?
[01:59:14.040 --> 01:59:14.880]   - Yeah.
[01:59:14.880 --> 01:59:15.700]   - No, I don't know about this.
[01:59:15.700 --> 01:59:17.800]   - I think it's an urban myth.
[01:59:17.800 --> 01:59:21.120]   I don't know if it's true, but I like it so I use it.
[01:59:21.120 --> 01:59:25.680]   So there was this, of course, a space competition
[01:59:25.680 --> 01:59:29.540]   and the Russians put the first animal in space.
[01:59:29.540 --> 01:59:30.380]   And the first-
[01:59:30.380 --> 01:59:32.800]   - It was a macaque monkey or something like that, yeah.
[01:59:32.800 --> 01:59:37.640]   - And then Leica and they put the first Sputnik,
[01:59:37.640 --> 01:59:40.200]   the satellite and man in space,
[01:59:40.200 --> 01:59:43.880]   but Americans took the man on the moon.
[01:59:43.880 --> 01:59:46.520]   And on the way, a lot of technologies got developed
[01:59:46.520 --> 01:59:49.120]   and the Americans, because of lack of gravity out there,
[01:59:49.120 --> 01:59:51.880]   developed the space pen with a huge investment.
[01:59:51.880 --> 01:59:53.320]   The Russians used the pencil.
[01:59:53.320 --> 01:59:59.560]   So I don't know if it's true, I don't think it is,
[01:59:59.560 --> 02:00:02.440]   but it represents something in the state of mind.
[02:00:02.440 --> 02:00:04.800]   Like you look at, for example, the military equipment
[02:00:04.800 --> 02:00:09.520]   in Soviet equipment, it's all can do multiple things.
[02:00:09.520 --> 02:00:12.600]   And it means that it's heavier, it's less efficient.
[02:00:12.600 --> 02:00:16.400]   It's not as light, but even the Navy SEALs
[02:00:16.400 --> 02:00:21.400]   will still carry an AK with certain conditions.
[02:00:21.400 --> 02:00:22.240]   Why?
[02:00:22.240 --> 02:00:23.740]   Because you can pour a whole bucket of sand
[02:00:23.740 --> 02:00:26.100]   into the mechanism and it will keep running.
[02:00:26.100 --> 02:00:29.280]   While the most advanced German heckler and kuchen,
[02:00:29.280 --> 02:00:33.560]   accurate and light weapons for every grain can get stuck
[02:00:33.560 --> 02:00:35.160]   and overly specialized.
[02:00:35.160 --> 02:00:36.840]   And there is something about this openness
[02:00:36.840 --> 02:00:39.400]   that we humans need to keep.
[02:00:39.400 --> 02:00:42.340]   And also maybe something for our leaders
[02:00:42.340 --> 02:00:45.960]   to be more of less specialist and more in this openness,
[02:00:45.960 --> 02:00:48.740]   less capable in this or that way,
[02:00:48.740 --> 02:00:51.080]   but more capable of doing the whole thing.
[02:00:51.080 --> 02:00:55.020]   - I love the story.
[02:00:55.020 --> 02:00:57.260]   Whether or not it's a legend or not,
[02:00:57.260 --> 02:01:00.440]   it's legendary because it's fantastic.
[02:01:00.440 --> 02:01:01.520]   As you say in the laboratory,
[02:01:01.520 --> 02:01:03.360]   whenever someone takes on a project in my lab,
[02:01:03.360 --> 02:01:05.560]   I always say, you have to ask yourself
[02:01:05.560 --> 02:01:09.040]   how much technical detail and challenge you want to take on
[02:01:09.040 --> 02:01:12.140]   because with more technology, advanced technology,
[02:01:12.140 --> 02:01:13.960]   yes, there's the opportunity for more discovery,
[02:01:13.960 --> 02:01:15.300]   but more downtime.
[02:01:15.300 --> 02:01:17.560]   Your PhD will literally take longer
[02:01:17.560 --> 02:01:18.820]   if you're going to use a microscope
[02:01:18.820 --> 02:01:21.680]   that's out of commission 30% of the time.
[02:01:21.680 --> 02:01:23.440]   And you just have to understand that.
[02:01:23.440 --> 02:01:26.280]   So there's a dynamic interplay there.
[02:01:26.280 --> 02:01:28.960]   - By the way, I think that scientists get it right.
[02:01:28.960 --> 02:01:30.840]   It's where you transmit the knowledge
[02:01:30.840 --> 02:01:32.880]   out of the scientific field
[02:01:32.880 --> 02:01:35.400]   because science have debate and everything.
[02:01:35.400 --> 02:01:36.920]   You're not so connected.
[02:01:36.920 --> 02:01:38.240]   Of course, this can happen as well,
[02:01:38.240 --> 02:01:43.240]   but then when it goes out and the simple person
[02:01:43.240 --> 02:01:46.880]   without the experience takes it more as a gospel,
[02:01:46.880 --> 02:01:50.100]   as a fixed thing, and then it was just a report.
[02:01:50.100 --> 02:01:53.220]   It was just reporting some functions here and play with it.
[02:01:53.220 --> 02:01:55.120]   See what it does for you
[02:01:55.120 --> 02:01:58.980]   because with all the greatest information that I can give,
[02:01:58.980 --> 02:02:00.420]   the person will examine it
[02:02:00.420 --> 02:02:03.980]   and it might be not useful at all for him.
[02:02:03.980 --> 02:02:05.460]   This is the practitioner.
[02:02:05.460 --> 02:02:06.700]   Make it your own.
[02:02:06.700 --> 02:02:10.700]   Go practice, try heat, cold, light,
[02:02:10.700 --> 02:02:14.120]   movement awareness to this, awareness to this.
[02:02:14.120 --> 02:02:16.400]   And this is up to you to make it yours,
[02:02:16.400 --> 02:02:19.800]   but we don't like to have this responsibility.
[02:02:19.800 --> 02:02:22.120]   - No, people prefer to have the,
[02:02:22.120 --> 02:02:24.040]   this will work the first time every time
[02:02:24.040 --> 02:02:27.640]   and will serve you best compared to everything else.
[02:02:27.640 --> 02:02:31.440]   And while there are more reliable tools than others,
[02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:34.220]   in my mind, the more reliable tools tend to be ones
[02:02:34.220 --> 02:02:38.060]   that are grounded in our innate physiology
[02:02:38.060 --> 02:02:41.780]   as opposed to some, I don't like the word hack.
[02:02:41.780 --> 02:02:43.660]   In fact, I loathe the word biohack
[02:02:43.660 --> 02:02:45.900]   as we were talking about again earlier
[02:02:45.900 --> 02:02:48.340]   because the hack in my mind is something
[02:02:48.340 --> 02:02:51.460]   that is designed for one purpose that's used for another.
[02:02:51.460 --> 02:02:54.540]   It's not the most efficient use of that tool
[02:02:54.540 --> 02:02:57.420]   nor is it naturally the best solution.
[02:02:57.420 --> 02:02:59.860]   Whereas biology has some very good solutions,
[02:02:59.860 --> 02:03:02.020]   but they don't always work, not every time.
[02:03:03.540 --> 02:03:05.820]   Earlier today, we did a practice in which,
[02:03:05.820 --> 02:03:09.380]   which involved invasion, shall we say,
[02:03:09.380 --> 02:03:11.320]   of peripersonal space.
[02:03:11.320 --> 02:03:14.140]   We weren't standing super close for any particular reason,
[02:03:14.140 --> 02:03:15.640]   but there was- - God forbid.
[02:03:15.640 --> 02:03:16.700]   - God forbid.
[02:03:16.700 --> 02:03:20.060]   But we, but there was, we were close enough together
[02:03:20.060 --> 02:03:21.740]   that we could touch one's torsos
[02:03:21.740 --> 02:03:24.100]   and we were doing that as part of this practice.
[02:03:24.100 --> 02:03:26.820]   And you encouraged me to pay attention to, you know,
[02:03:26.820 --> 02:03:28.360]   how does it feel to have someone
[02:03:28.360 --> 02:03:30.260]   in your peripersonal space?
[02:03:30.260 --> 02:03:32.040]   And then this notion of reactivity.
[02:03:32.040 --> 02:03:34.120]   I find this an immensely interesting
[02:03:34.120 --> 02:03:36.660]   and potentially powerful practice
[02:03:36.660 --> 02:03:38.460]   because I think a lot of people,
[02:03:38.460 --> 02:03:41.780]   I know a lot of people suffer from anxiety
[02:03:41.780 --> 02:03:44.060]   just being in a face-to-face conversation.
[02:03:44.060 --> 02:03:45.980]   Some people have a lot of anxiety
[02:03:45.980 --> 02:03:47.660]   about being physically close to people,
[02:03:47.660 --> 02:03:49.520]   whether or not they know them or not.
[02:03:49.520 --> 02:03:51.300]   And many people are reactive.
[02:03:51.300 --> 02:03:53.140]   They are in that anticipatory state
[02:03:53.140 --> 02:03:54.540]   of something is going to happen.
[02:03:54.540 --> 02:03:56.940]   And sometimes this relates to trauma and negative experience,
[02:03:56.940 --> 02:03:57.920]   but sometimes no.
[02:03:57.920 --> 02:04:02.140]   Sometimes they're just not used to being in dynamic, excuse me,
[02:04:02.140 --> 02:04:04.640]   exchange with other beings.
[02:04:04.640 --> 02:04:08.100]   And so one thing that I love about the movement practice
[02:04:08.100 --> 02:04:10.320]   and how dynamic is that one can explore that space.
[02:04:10.320 --> 02:04:13.540]   Maybe you could talk about that a little bit more.
[02:04:13.540 --> 02:04:14.380]   - Yeah.
[02:04:14.380 --> 02:04:21.700]   Touch, proximity, all these things also taking very,
[02:04:25.240 --> 02:04:28.940]   it takes a very, I think, limited place in our lives.
[02:04:28.940 --> 02:04:32.100]   People are not touched and they don't touch enough.
[02:04:32.100 --> 02:04:35.500]   There is certain bubbles of peripersonal space
[02:04:35.500 --> 02:04:37.860]   according to culture, according to environment,
[02:04:37.860 --> 02:04:39.180]   what is right, what is wrong.
[02:04:39.180 --> 02:04:41.060]   And then came all the, of course,
[02:04:41.060 --> 02:04:45.300]   politically correctness and harassment and all kinds.
[02:04:45.300 --> 02:04:46.660]   And this is a problem.
[02:04:46.660 --> 02:04:50.140]   It's a problem to navigate all this scenario.
[02:04:50.140 --> 02:04:53.620]   And I think there is definitely this side
[02:04:53.620 --> 02:04:55.380]   which is suffering.
[02:04:55.380 --> 02:04:59.740]   People go to BJJ classes to touch, not to learn BJJ.
[02:04:59.740 --> 02:05:03.100]   Most of it, they're not even aware of it.
[02:05:03.100 --> 02:05:05.920]   Before they would go to a prostitute maybe.
[02:05:05.920 --> 02:05:10.800]   It would not be honest to say that,
[02:05:10.800 --> 02:05:16.980]   yeah, this is not required or necessary more in our lives.
[02:05:16.980 --> 02:05:19.760]   Children who are not touched,
[02:05:19.760 --> 02:05:22.640]   there is a lot of information about that and the problems.
[02:05:22.640 --> 02:05:24.520]   But adults who are not touched,
[02:05:24.520 --> 02:05:25.920]   there is not a lot of information.
[02:05:25.920 --> 02:05:27.980]   And I think it's no less of a problem
[02:05:27.980 --> 02:05:32.120]   because it's something that has to be constantly present.
[02:05:32.120 --> 02:05:37.120]   And then proximity, being able to, as you said,
[02:05:37.120 --> 02:05:41.000]   remove certain reactivity and to learn to control
[02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:46.000]   that volume control over how reactive I am.
[02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:49.100]   And in other scenarios,
[02:05:49.100 --> 02:05:51.260]   how do I remove this reactivity altogether
[02:05:51.260 --> 02:05:54.500]   is very important for performance and also for our lives,
[02:05:54.500 --> 02:05:56.340]   for clear thinking, et cetera,
[02:05:56.340 --> 02:05:58.560]   because everything is moving through us
[02:05:58.560 --> 02:06:00.240]   and is being monitored by us.
[02:06:00.240 --> 02:06:03.860]   So everything has the potential to detract us
[02:06:03.860 --> 02:06:07.320]   from a certain direction of exploration.
[02:06:07.320 --> 02:06:10.240]   And if you're reactive, you're a slave.
[02:06:10.240 --> 02:06:13.540]   It becomes worse and worse and worse.
[02:06:13.540 --> 02:06:18.540]   Or for example, a fighter or a football player, et cetera,
[02:06:18.540 --> 02:06:21.060]   has to know what to take, what not to take.
[02:06:21.060 --> 02:06:22.940]   The fact that you can sense more
[02:06:22.940 --> 02:06:25.280]   doesn't mean you should react to it.
[02:06:25.280 --> 02:06:26.820]   And the practice helps that
[02:06:26.820 --> 02:06:29.140]   by bringing people into these scenarios,
[02:06:29.140 --> 02:06:31.320]   but oftentimes disarming them.
[02:06:31.320 --> 02:06:34.040]   Like when we were working closely today,
[02:06:34.040 --> 02:06:37.180]   and because you have a certain background
[02:06:37.180 --> 02:06:39.300]   with boxing or fighting,
[02:06:39.300 --> 02:06:43.620]   I can tell you you are missing some kind of a way
[02:06:43.620 --> 02:06:46.380]   to be in that space that is not martial.
[02:06:46.380 --> 02:06:50.300]   So you carry a certain tone,
[02:06:50.300 --> 02:06:52.280]   although you're a very kind person,
[02:06:52.280 --> 02:06:56.060]   but oftentimes you help me without realizing
[02:06:56.060 --> 02:06:59.420]   you're holding me with a lot of strength, for example.
[02:06:59.420 --> 02:07:03.420]   And it just, it was clear to me
[02:07:03.420 --> 02:07:06.280]   you're not fully aware of what is unfolding,
[02:07:06.280 --> 02:07:09.420]   and it's just, of course, a question of experience.
[02:07:09.420 --> 02:07:12.880]   So to be able to be in this scenario but do something else,
[02:07:12.880 --> 02:07:17.020]   which is not geared towards winning, losing, competition,
[02:07:17.020 --> 02:07:19.860]   or just being able to play with another person.
[02:07:19.860 --> 02:07:22.940]   Like, for example, contact improvisation took that
[02:07:22.940 --> 02:07:26.020]   and played with that, and the work of Steve Paxton
[02:07:26.020 --> 02:07:28.620]   for the ones who are not familiar.
[02:07:28.620 --> 02:07:34.660]   So this is where I call it the hybrids become very useful.
[02:07:34.660 --> 02:07:40.060]   Like we don't, when you are practicing in this open way,
[02:07:40.060 --> 02:07:43.740]   you are not bound by specific rule set
[02:07:43.740 --> 02:07:44.980]   or ways of doing things.
[02:07:44.980 --> 02:07:49.800]   It can be a fight, but it can be a dance.
[02:07:50.120 --> 02:07:51.000]   A moment after.
[02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.200]   Another thing that I learned from Capoeira,
[02:07:53.200 --> 02:07:55.880]   the situation is very tricky there,
[02:07:55.880 --> 02:07:59.800]   because I've seen kids doing cartwheels in Brazil
[02:07:59.800 --> 02:08:02.980]   and Caesars fall from their pockets.
[02:08:02.980 --> 02:08:06.920]   Why would you go with a Caesar in your pocket?
[02:08:06.920 --> 02:08:09.440]   Obviously there is certain intentions.
[02:08:09.440 --> 02:08:11.240]   And then at other times you see backflips
[02:08:11.240 --> 02:08:15.800]   and beautiful things, but people die in Capoeira every year.
[02:08:15.800 --> 02:08:18.700]   Neck breaks or something.
[02:08:18.700 --> 02:08:23.020]   Kicks to the face from various violence.
[02:08:23.020 --> 02:08:27.360]   I've explored other martial arts and boxing.
[02:08:27.360 --> 02:08:30.400]   I was involved with MMA and BJJ,
[02:08:30.400 --> 02:08:32.820]   but I tell you the most violent arena is that.
[02:08:32.820 --> 02:08:34.920]   Why? Because it's unknown.
[02:08:34.920 --> 02:08:36.580]   One moment it's smiles.
[02:08:36.580 --> 02:08:38.900]   Another moment it's something else, and it's uncontrolled.
[02:08:38.900 --> 02:08:40.500]   There is no categories, no weights,
[02:08:40.500 --> 02:08:42.700]   and it's a street phenomenon.
[02:08:42.700 --> 02:08:44.560]   So you have musical instruments.
[02:08:44.560 --> 02:08:46.340]   Sometimes they break it on your head.
[02:08:46.340 --> 02:08:49.480]   People don't see that, but you can look online on YouTube
[02:08:49.480 --> 02:08:51.840]   and see some of that side of Capoeira,
[02:08:51.840 --> 02:08:56.320]   which is actually the day-to-day in Brazil
[02:08:56.320 --> 02:08:59.540]   and the reality and how things unfolded.
[02:08:59.540 --> 02:09:04.480]   So it's very important to explore many ways of being
[02:09:04.480 --> 02:09:08.040]   within different distances and spaces from other people
[02:09:08.040 --> 02:09:10.400]   and touched in different ways
[02:09:10.400 --> 02:09:14.760]   and not contextualizing it always in the same way.
[02:09:14.760 --> 02:09:17.640]   I can touch your chest in one way.
[02:09:17.640 --> 02:09:20.680]   I can touch it with the exact same pressure and speed,
[02:09:20.680 --> 02:09:22.960]   but it will feel very different.
[02:09:22.960 --> 02:09:24.600]   The parameters, I'm not sure.
[02:09:24.600 --> 02:09:29.440]   Certain intentions, certain combination of postures or ways,
[02:09:29.440 --> 02:09:32.160]   and this is beautiful exploration.
[02:09:32.160 --> 02:09:36.120]   Again, I would encourage you and others
[02:09:36.120 --> 02:09:38.160]   to explore the discomfort.
[02:09:38.160 --> 02:09:42.520]   For example, certain discomfort to be with a man
[02:09:42.520 --> 02:09:44.320]   in a certain scenario or with a woman
[02:09:44.320 --> 02:09:46.980]   and trying to see what is that,
[02:09:46.980 --> 02:09:48.960]   because if we are truly strong,
[02:09:48.960 --> 02:09:51.680]   we are not afraid of anything.
[02:09:51.680 --> 02:09:56.680]   If we truly know who we are and we are in that exploration,
[02:09:56.680 --> 02:10:00.140]   we don't know the end result, but we are in a research
[02:10:00.140 --> 02:10:03.160]   and then we are not afraid of being in that or this
[02:10:03.160 --> 02:10:05.240]   and we don't come out of boundaries
[02:10:05.240 --> 02:10:07.760]   and this will improve our culture tremendously.
[02:10:07.760 --> 02:10:09.880]   Of course, there must be agreement.
[02:10:09.880 --> 02:10:11.780]   You never force yourself, but you meet someone
[02:10:11.780 --> 02:10:14.380]   who is also interested in that exploration
[02:10:14.380 --> 02:10:15.480]   and then you do it.
[02:10:15.480 --> 02:10:19.080]   And there are many scenarios to do that
[02:10:19.080 --> 02:10:22.600]   with traditional practices, like learning to grapple
[02:10:22.600 --> 02:10:27.500]   or going to contact improvisation and studying there
[02:10:27.500 --> 02:10:31.260]   or going to dance, to Latin dance class.
[02:10:31.260 --> 02:10:35.480]   And there is, of course, my favorite is to create
[02:10:35.480 --> 02:10:39.720]   and to come up with your own hybrids of that and scenarios,
[02:10:39.720 --> 02:10:41.540]   communicating with your loved one
[02:10:41.540 --> 02:10:45.200]   through movement, not sitting around food and talking,
[02:10:45.200 --> 02:10:48.080]   moving together in all kinds of ways.
[02:10:48.080 --> 02:10:50.000]   Sometimes it's walking together,
[02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:54.280]   but sometimes it's all kinds of, it can be game, playful,
[02:10:54.280 --> 02:10:58.200]   it can be romantic, and there are many shades.
[02:10:58.200 --> 02:11:01.680]   Sex doesn't start here and here, right?
[02:11:01.680 --> 02:11:03.080]   It's like, it's a continuum
[02:11:03.080 --> 02:11:06.120]   and we don't even need to define it in that way.
[02:11:06.120 --> 02:11:11.000]   So with time, I think it unlocks a lot of things.
[02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.820]   People become much stronger in a good sense,
[02:11:13.820 --> 02:11:18.820]   in sense of becoming, being, and we abuse less
[02:11:18.820 --> 02:11:24.020]   and we can approach, yeah, other aspects to us.
[02:11:24.020 --> 02:11:27.280]   - I love the idea that through the exploration
[02:11:27.280 --> 02:11:32.280]   of a range of physical contacts, provided one knows
[02:11:32.280 --> 02:11:35.500]   they can always return to their center, so to speak,
[02:11:35.500 --> 02:11:38.680]   then there's a lot of opportunity that opens up.
[02:11:38.680 --> 02:11:43.200]   I wish there was more of that encouraged in children's play,
[02:11:43.200 --> 02:11:47.040]   but also, as you mentioned, in adult environments,
[02:11:47.040 --> 02:11:51.040]   because yeah, nowadays, for all sorts of reasons
[02:11:51.040 --> 02:11:53.560]   that you've touched on, the idea of keeping
[02:11:53.560 --> 02:11:56.280]   at least an arm's length distance has become critical.
[02:11:56.280 --> 02:11:57.440]   There are a lot of environments actually
[02:11:57.440 --> 02:11:58.960]   where hugging is not allowed.
[02:11:58.960 --> 02:12:01.480]   I don't know what it's like in Israel,
[02:12:01.480 --> 02:12:03.840]   but in the States, many institutions here,
[02:12:03.840 --> 02:12:06.880]   you're not allowed to touch anyone else's body.
[02:12:06.880 --> 02:12:08.000]   There's actually a wonderful study
[02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000]   that comes to mind from an Israeli laboratory,
[02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.500]   a guy named Noam Sobol is over there,
[02:12:12.500 --> 02:12:18.480]   who has shown that by recording people's first interactions,
[02:12:18.480 --> 02:12:22.480]   that when people meet, if they shake hands,
[02:12:22.480 --> 02:12:24.980]   they almost always, I think it's greater
[02:12:24.980 --> 02:12:28.000]   than 85% of the time, they will then wipe the chemicals
[02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:30.200]   from the other person onto their own eyes,
[02:12:30.200 --> 02:12:32.240]   typically their eyes or their face.
[02:12:32.240 --> 02:12:35.760]   This changed a little bit during the whole pandemic thing,
[02:12:35.760 --> 02:12:39.760]   but this is thought to be a carryover
[02:12:39.760 --> 02:12:41.300]   from what other animals do in terms
[02:12:41.300 --> 02:12:44.480]   of exchanging microbiome elements, exchanging chemicals,
[02:12:44.480 --> 02:12:47.960]   that we're constantly feeding our subconscious
[02:12:47.960 --> 02:12:52.900]   with the chemical, knowledge of the chemical constituents
[02:12:52.900 --> 02:12:54.200]   of other people, right?
[02:12:54.200 --> 02:12:57.240]   So it goes way beyond how people smell,
[02:12:57.240 --> 02:12:58.800]   how they look, et cetera.
[02:12:58.800 --> 02:13:01.780]   More touch seems to me just, as you said,
[02:13:01.780 --> 02:13:03.160]   provided it's consensual, it seems like
[02:13:03.160 --> 02:13:05.720]   it's just a really good thing overall.
[02:13:05.720 --> 02:13:09.840]   And I think maybe also important for discharging,
[02:13:09.840 --> 02:13:13.920]   discharging certain experiences, remodeling, reframing,
[02:13:13.920 --> 02:13:16.600]   so it's like touch is very powerful in that.
[02:13:16.600 --> 02:13:19.840]   If you're touched and you're touching a lot,
[02:13:19.840 --> 02:13:22.520]   you're unpacking and you experience that touch
[02:13:22.520 --> 02:13:26.040]   that maybe has been traumatic and you're reframing it,
[02:13:26.040 --> 02:13:31.040]   you have the opportunity, which is something interesting.
[02:13:31.040 --> 02:13:36.040]   I've heard some story about some traditional culture
[02:13:36.040 --> 02:13:39.700]   in which when you were burned by mistake,
[02:13:39.700 --> 02:13:41.600]   they would immediately burn you again.
[02:13:41.600 --> 02:13:45.360]   And it made me think, and then there would not be
[02:13:45.360 --> 02:13:50.360]   any burn marks and there would not be the same side effects.
[02:13:50.360 --> 02:13:52.000]   That's the claim.
[02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:55.360]   It made me think, it's like, what's the source of this?
[02:13:55.360 --> 02:13:58.260]   And I realized that maybe it allows
[02:13:58.260 --> 02:14:01.020]   a certain completion to happen,
[02:14:01.020 --> 02:14:04.060]   that in the traumatic moment is not there.
[02:14:04.060 --> 02:14:07.020]   So the re-exposure, while you're still open,
[02:14:07.020 --> 02:14:08.860]   the pores are still open,
[02:14:08.860 --> 02:14:11.380]   allows you to reframe the experience.
[02:14:11.380 --> 02:14:15.060]   And then the unfolding of the rest of the event
[02:14:15.060 --> 02:14:16.580]   is very different.
[02:14:16.580 --> 02:14:19.060]   This is, if you're touching and you're practicing
[02:14:19.060 --> 02:14:20.940]   the day-to-day and you're working with people
[02:14:20.940 --> 02:14:23.020]   and you're being touched and people come closer
[02:14:23.020 --> 02:14:25.080]   or further away, it happens naturally.
[02:14:27.400 --> 02:14:30.160]   - Yeah, and if you pass a certain limit
[02:14:30.160 --> 02:14:33.640]   and it becomes too much, there is always, of course,
[02:14:33.640 --> 02:14:36.540]   communication that has to be present.
[02:14:36.540 --> 02:14:40.700]   Certain cultures make this communication pre.
[02:14:40.700 --> 02:14:43.360]   Certain cultures post.
[02:14:43.360 --> 02:14:47.160]   The Israeli, for example, post here, pre.
[02:14:47.160 --> 02:14:49.820]   - So in Israel, they'll say, "That didn't feel good to me,"
[02:14:49.820 --> 02:14:51.940]   or, "That felt good," or, "That was fine."
[02:14:51.940 --> 02:14:53.700]   - Yeah, it would be more common.
[02:14:55.200 --> 02:14:57.300]   Here in the airport, the guy's telling me,
[02:14:57.300 --> 02:15:00.680]   "I'm gonna slide my hands up towards your crotch
[02:15:00.680 --> 02:15:02.980]   "until I meet a hard stop."
[02:15:02.980 --> 02:15:06.820]   And then he does this in a way
[02:15:06.820 --> 02:15:10.940]   that is supposed to show me I have no enjoyment in that.
[02:15:10.940 --> 02:15:13.140]   And for me, it just feels aggressive.
[02:15:13.140 --> 02:15:17.140]   But his intention is good, showing me.
[02:15:17.140 --> 02:15:19.100]   But if it was a loving touch,
[02:15:19.100 --> 02:15:21.500]   it would be nicer for me, actually.
[02:15:21.500 --> 02:15:24.580]   Personally, it would be gentle.
[02:15:24.580 --> 02:15:26.920]   But he goes up there and he shows me,
[02:15:26.920 --> 02:15:29.000]   "I have no enjoyment in this."
[02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:33.440]   But, oh, that's my testicle right there.
[02:15:33.440 --> 02:15:37.300]   So it's different choices.
[02:15:37.300 --> 02:15:38.760]   I don't think it's worse.
[02:15:38.760 --> 02:15:42.380]   But this description can be a bit dissociated.
[02:15:42.380 --> 02:15:44.020]   And what does it make me think?
[02:15:44.020 --> 02:15:46.660]   Is it truly what he feels or not?
[02:15:46.660 --> 02:15:49.500]   'Cause it feels robotic, so it's not,
[02:15:49.500 --> 02:15:51.600]   so sometimes I'd rather not say it.
[02:15:51.600 --> 02:15:54.340]   And I'm going to touch your chest.
[02:15:54.340 --> 02:15:56.980]   I'm just place my hand on the chest.
[02:15:56.980 --> 02:16:00.960]   And of course, we can't avoid a problem.
[02:16:00.960 --> 02:16:02.460]   I'm not suggesting that there is.
[02:16:02.460 --> 02:16:04.140]   But there is an examination.
[02:16:04.140 --> 02:16:06.820]   And because I moved around the world,
[02:16:06.820 --> 02:16:07.720]   I've seen many things.
[02:16:07.720 --> 02:16:10.540]   And I've seen benefits here, benefits there.
[02:16:10.540 --> 02:16:13.380]   And in the practice,
[02:16:13.380 --> 02:16:15.820]   I think it's important to discuss this, to examine this.
[02:16:15.820 --> 02:16:19.620]   I don't have a solution, but it's something to talk about.
[02:16:19.620 --> 02:16:20.940]   - It is something to talk about.
[02:16:20.940 --> 02:16:21.860]   And I'm glad you raised it
[02:16:21.860 --> 02:16:24.500]   because I think that it's so clear to me
[02:16:24.500 --> 02:16:27.400]   that much of the value of a movement practice
[02:16:27.400 --> 02:16:29.780]   involves this dynamic interaction with somebody else.
[02:16:29.780 --> 02:16:32.340]   As you pointed out, it can be performed on one's own
[02:16:32.340 --> 02:16:34.420]   and practiced throughout one's day.
[02:16:34.420 --> 02:16:39.420]   But the unpredictability is a key element to all of it.
[02:16:39.420 --> 02:16:43.420]   And in bringing out all the potential that you've described.
[02:16:43.420 --> 02:16:48.620]   In reference to this notion of trauma and burn and re-burn,
[02:16:48.620 --> 02:16:50.460]   my colleague at Stanford, David Spiegel,
[02:16:50.460 --> 02:16:52.540]   he works on trauma.
[02:16:52.540 --> 02:16:55.180]   And he's a, actually on this podcast,
[02:16:55.180 --> 02:16:58.080]   he voiced that he's against things like trigger warnings
[02:16:58.080 --> 02:16:59.860]   because of the way that it puts the nervous system
[02:16:59.860 --> 02:17:02.540]   into this state of readiness and reactivity
[02:17:02.540 --> 02:17:05.280]   that can exacerbate problems.
[02:17:05.280 --> 02:17:09.540]   Whereas it's very clear from the literature on trauma
[02:17:09.540 --> 02:17:12.100]   and trauma relief that the way to deal with that
[02:17:12.100 --> 02:17:14.040]   is through a controlled,
[02:17:14.040 --> 02:17:17.660]   but clearly a controlled re-exposure to the trauma
[02:17:17.660 --> 02:17:20.580]   in order to diminish the emotional response over time.
[02:17:20.580 --> 02:17:21.900]   I mean, it's very clear.
[02:17:21.900 --> 02:17:23.240]   If we avoid the thing,
[02:17:23.240 --> 02:17:25.100]   obviously we don't want to re-injure ourselves
[02:17:25.100 --> 02:17:26.140]   or re-traumatize,
[02:17:26.140 --> 02:17:28.100]   but if one avoids the thing that makes them upset
[02:17:28.100 --> 02:17:30.020]   over and over, all it does is serve to create
[02:17:30.020 --> 02:17:31.460]   a heightened state of readiness.
[02:17:31.460 --> 02:17:33.420]   It primes more trauma.
[02:17:33.420 --> 02:17:35.020]   So I think it makes good sense.
[02:17:35.020 --> 02:17:38.260]   - I think impressions are very useful here also
[02:17:38.260 --> 02:17:42.220]   when stepping into an area in which trauma can occur.
[02:17:42.220 --> 02:17:46.160]   And then by going through the impression
[02:17:46.160 --> 02:17:47.720]   that it already occurred,
[02:17:47.720 --> 02:17:50.720]   you create some kind of a thermal layer of protection.
[02:17:50.720 --> 02:17:56.660]   So I've already been hit when I'm entering that space.
[02:17:56.660 --> 02:17:58.420]   It's so beneficial.
[02:17:58.420 --> 02:18:01.900]   Or I've already been touched in a way that I didn't like
[02:18:01.900 --> 02:18:03.960]   if I go to a contact improvisation class.
[02:18:03.960 --> 02:18:06.500]   And just running this scenario in your head
[02:18:06.500 --> 02:18:10.220]   protects so well.
[02:18:10.220 --> 02:18:11.140]   Yeah.
[02:18:11.140 --> 02:18:13.100]   - I'm glad you mentioned running scenarios in your head.
[02:18:13.100 --> 02:18:15.780]   I've been curious all day as to whether or not
[02:18:15.780 --> 02:18:18.880]   you do visualization or mental rehearsal
[02:18:18.880 --> 02:18:20.140]   of physical movement.
[02:18:20.140 --> 02:18:24.560]   This seems to be a popular idea in the States.
[02:18:24.560 --> 02:18:26.260]   People are always asking me, you know,
[02:18:26.260 --> 02:18:29.840]   can you just imagine a movement and learn it better
[02:18:29.840 --> 02:18:32.160]   than were you to actually perform it?
[02:18:32.160 --> 02:18:33.660]   My hunch based on,
[02:18:33.660 --> 02:18:35.780]   and my understanding of the scientific literature
[02:18:35.780 --> 02:18:39.300]   is that visualization can be useful to some extent
[02:18:39.300 --> 02:18:41.740]   for people that are very good at visualization,
[02:18:41.740 --> 02:18:43.900]   but for many people, it doesn't help.
[02:18:43.900 --> 02:18:47.400]   And that there's nothing like real physical practice
[02:18:47.400 --> 02:18:50.640]   to improve physical practice.
[02:18:50.640 --> 02:18:53.580]   - Yeah, the word visualization is not good, obviously.
[02:18:53.580 --> 02:18:58.020]   It has to be experientialization
[02:18:58.020 --> 02:19:02.240]   in a very complete way, not just visually, of course.
[02:19:02.240 --> 02:19:08.820]   And unless you already developed certain experience,
[02:19:10.540 --> 02:19:14.820]   tangible experience that has benefited from feedback,
[02:19:14.820 --> 02:19:19.820]   from outside feedback, it is not a very useful thing to do.
[02:19:19.820 --> 02:19:24.380]   And it ends up being fabrications.
[02:19:24.380 --> 02:19:25.860]   But if you're very experienced
[02:19:25.860 --> 02:19:29.160]   and you already gained the benefit of being burnt here
[02:19:29.160 --> 02:19:32.500]   or overextended here, then you have a certain experience
[02:19:32.500 --> 02:19:35.400]   and then you can strengthen certain aspects of it,
[02:19:35.400 --> 02:19:38.300]   but you gotta be careful because you do not have feedback.
[02:19:39.260 --> 02:19:41.020]   And because of the missing feedback,
[02:19:41.020 --> 02:19:43.100]   you might develop delusions.
[02:19:43.100 --> 02:19:46.560]   It might be that you develop a stronger patterning,
[02:19:46.560 --> 02:19:49.620]   but ultimately, this would lead you away
[02:19:49.620 --> 02:19:54.360]   from the aliveness of the movement itself.
[02:19:54.360 --> 02:19:56.600]   Drilling, for example.
[02:19:56.600 --> 02:20:01.600]   Very useful to learn a general infrastructure
[02:20:01.600 --> 02:20:04.360]   of the movement sleeve or the technique.
[02:20:04.360 --> 02:20:07.340]   But then to dress it up, you need feedback.
[02:20:07.340 --> 02:20:09.440]   You need it to be alive.
[02:20:09.440 --> 02:20:14.140]   You need to receive something corrective.
[02:20:14.140 --> 02:20:15.760]   - I love it.
[02:20:15.760 --> 02:20:18.260]   For many people, they approach movement
[02:20:18.260 --> 02:20:21.540]   in the form of weight training or yoga or running.
[02:20:21.540 --> 02:20:24.020]   Yoga's a bit more dynamic,
[02:20:24.020 --> 02:20:29.020]   but fairly linear types of exercise and movement.
[02:20:29.020 --> 02:20:33.020]   Peloton, rowing, those kinds of things.
[02:20:33.020 --> 02:20:37.020]   I think most people will probably not depart
[02:20:37.020 --> 02:20:39.700]   from those practices entirely because they like them.
[02:20:39.700 --> 02:20:41.140]   I'm speaking about myself.
[02:20:41.140 --> 02:20:42.340]   I like some of those very much.
[02:20:42.340 --> 02:20:43.180]   I enjoy them.
[02:20:43.180 --> 02:20:47.700]   But in terms of thinking about adding a movement practice
[02:20:47.700 --> 02:20:51.040]   to one's already existing exercise regime,
[02:20:51.040 --> 02:20:54.340]   I can imagine threading it throughout the day.
[02:20:54.340 --> 02:20:56.780]   I can imagine having a dedicated movement practice.
[02:20:56.780 --> 02:21:00.300]   One thing that I have started doing on the basis
[02:21:00.300 --> 02:21:02.840]   of some of your teachings, and I just sort of created
[02:21:02.840 --> 02:21:05.260]   this idea, is rather than statically standing there
[02:21:05.260 --> 02:21:07.280]   and lifting weights, actually walking from,
[02:21:07.280 --> 02:21:09.420]   as I alternate repetitions, it occurred to me
[02:21:09.420 --> 02:21:13.760]   that I'd never done a curl, a bicep curl,
[02:21:13.760 --> 02:21:15.920]   with one foot in front of the other.
[02:21:15.920 --> 02:21:18.780]   And then I'd never actually switched that up.
[02:21:18.780 --> 02:21:21.380]   And it's kind of an odd stance to be standing in parallel
[02:21:21.380 --> 02:21:22.220]   and curling one's arm.
[02:21:22.220 --> 02:21:24.820]   It's kind of a ridiculous movement when one thinks about it.
[02:21:24.820 --> 02:21:26.080]   So I started incorporating some of that.
[02:21:26.080 --> 02:21:27.540]   You get some strange looks in the gym,
[02:21:27.540 --> 02:21:29.720]   but I just give them strange looks back.
[02:21:29.720 --> 02:21:33.660]   So what are your thoughts about these very linear forms
[02:21:33.660 --> 02:21:37.740]   of exercise, and do you encourage people
[02:21:37.740 --> 02:21:41.180]   to expand the play space, as it were,
[02:21:41.180 --> 02:21:43.020]   for these kinds of exercise?
[02:21:43.020 --> 02:21:47.100]   Or do you think that movement practice is just best explored
[02:21:47.100 --> 02:21:50.940]   through three-dimensionality, gravity,
[02:21:50.940 --> 02:21:52.940]   and maybe a stick or a ball?
[02:21:52.940 --> 02:21:58.100]   - It's definitely a problem, and it's approachable.
[02:21:58.100 --> 02:22:00.900]   People want a quick, people want a hack.
[02:22:00.900 --> 02:22:03.920]   People want the icing, there is no cake.
[02:22:03.920 --> 02:22:05.740]   There is no cake.
[02:22:05.740 --> 02:22:08.620]   And it's just like industries of icing, icing.
[02:22:08.620 --> 02:22:09.760]   Icing on what?
[02:22:09.760 --> 02:22:11.260]   What are you putting it on?
[02:22:11.260 --> 02:22:16.100]   So for me, that's why I'm going towards this side.
[02:22:16.100 --> 02:22:18.080]   It's like, I have my life.
[02:22:18.080 --> 02:22:21.160]   Now tell me what movement practices I should pursue.
[02:22:21.160 --> 02:22:23.520]   You are movement.
[02:22:23.520 --> 02:22:28.140]   In essence, you are not thinking of yourself
[02:22:28.140 --> 02:22:32.060]   in any serious way through my eyes.
[02:22:32.060 --> 02:22:35.960]   There is a dynamic entity to you.
[02:22:35.960 --> 02:22:39.820]   The body is a huge part of it, communicating.
[02:22:39.820 --> 02:22:42.540]   You have genetic layers.
[02:22:42.540 --> 02:22:45.180]   There is personalities that got developed
[02:22:45.180 --> 02:22:47.420]   and built around various influences,
[02:22:47.420 --> 02:22:49.900]   but then there is also some kind of an essence,
[02:22:49.900 --> 02:22:53.660]   something that reeks from within the cells.
[02:22:53.660 --> 02:22:56.420]   And if you grew up in my family
[02:22:56.420 --> 02:22:59.700]   and I grew up in your family, it would still be the same.
[02:22:59.700 --> 02:23:02.540]   And it's something that I always try to think about.
[02:23:02.540 --> 02:23:04.080]   What is that inside of me?
[02:23:04.080 --> 02:23:09.380]   So I think these practices, they're very good,
[02:23:09.380 --> 02:23:12.060]   but they're not designed for the goal
[02:23:12.060 --> 02:23:14.580]   that we think they were designed to.
[02:23:14.580 --> 02:23:17.420]   It orients towards something else.
[02:23:17.420 --> 02:23:19.340]   For example, yoga.
[02:23:19.340 --> 02:23:21.980]   There is a good book called The Yoga Body,
[02:23:21.980 --> 02:23:25.280]   which will destroy a lot of people's yoga practice.
[02:23:26.340 --> 02:23:29.620]   And it goes into, how did we get to this yoga?
[02:23:29.620 --> 02:23:32.140]   The influence of Swedish gymnastics
[02:23:32.140 --> 02:23:35.920]   and Mongolian contortionists
[02:23:35.920 --> 02:23:40.580]   and the Western, the West, affecting it.
[02:23:40.580 --> 02:23:42.100]   And then the ancient practice,
[02:23:42.100 --> 02:23:47.100]   which was merely asana-related posture, position.
[02:23:47.100 --> 02:23:49.500]   So actually, you said yoga is less linear.
[02:23:49.500 --> 02:23:53.540]   Yoga is very linear, very linear these days, these lines.
[02:23:53.540 --> 02:23:55.420]   Look at all the traditional dances.
[02:23:55.420 --> 02:23:58.060]   They look like nothing like yoga.
[02:23:58.060 --> 02:23:59.580]   Look at Thai dance.
[02:23:59.580 --> 02:24:02.260]   Look at Chinese dances, martial arts.
[02:24:02.260 --> 02:24:03.660]   It's all rounded, it's all curly.
[02:24:03.660 --> 02:24:06.780]   It's like out nature, what you see in nature
[02:24:06.780 --> 02:24:09.340]   and the movement of the animals.
[02:24:09.340 --> 02:24:11.820]   So where does it come from?
[02:24:11.820 --> 02:24:14.780]   These are things to understand because it designs you now.
[02:24:14.780 --> 02:24:16.060]   It shapes you.
[02:24:16.060 --> 02:24:19.620]   You're placing yourself in these forces of change
[02:24:19.620 --> 02:24:21.500]   and these streams of change.
[02:24:21.500 --> 02:24:22.820]   And you have a good intention.
[02:24:22.820 --> 02:24:24.280]   You just want this or that.
[02:24:24.280 --> 02:24:27.100]   But the joke is on us.
[02:24:27.100 --> 02:24:32.020]   And the movement practice for me is first, education.
[02:24:32.020 --> 02:24:33.620]   Let's start to think about this.
[02:24:33.620 --> 02:24:37.820]   I have nothing that I can just sprinkle now,
[02:24:37.820 --> 02:24:41.060]   some magic powder that will help resolve this
[02:24:41.060 --> 02:24:43.820]   because it's a start of a deep investigation.
[02:24:43.820 --> 02:24:48.500]   And then some of the things, let's talk pragmatically
[02:24:48.500 --> 02:24:51.980]   because what you described is not about you placing
[02:24:51.980 --> 02:24:53.780]   the foot in front when you're curling.
[02:24:53.780 --> 02:24:56.420]   It's about the examination.
[02:24:56.420 --> 02:25:00.220]   This is why it is a very good direction.
[02:25:00.220 --> 02:25:02.440]   And then you will need another one, another one.
[02:25:02.440 --> 02:25:04.800]   Don't get stuck on that foot in front of it
[02:25:04.800 --> 02:25:06.920]   and try to do with the eyes closed
[02:25:06.920 --> 02:25:08.200]   or with a different head posture
[02:25:08.200 --> 02:25:11.820]   and you will see things arrive, unrelated things
[02:25:11.820 --> 02:25:14.600]   because the associative mind, the thinking,
[02:25:14.600 --> 02:25:17.500]   this relates to this doesn't get to the heart of it, never.
[02:25:17.500 --> 02:25:23.580]   So just infusing these elements
[02:25:24.060 --> 02:25:29.060]   like in a cup will create endless combinations,
[02:25:29.060 --> 02:25:31.940]   possibilities and a lot of discovery.
[02:25:31.940 --> 02:25:34.500]   And this for me is humility of the practitioner.
[02:25:34.500 --> 02:25:36.140]   I don't know, I try.
[02:25:36.140 --> 02:25:39.700]   Like today with you, I tried various combinations
[02:25:39.700 --> 02:25:41.140]   and oh, I discover something.
[02:25:41.140 --> 02:25:43.340]   Oh, this is a playful approach
[02:25:43.340 --> 02:25:45.520]   and this is a researcher approach.
[02:25:45.520 --> 02:25:49.540]   I don't try to fit my truth into something.
[02:25:49.540 --> 02:25:51.840]   I'm there to examine.
[02:25:51.840 --> 02:25:53.620]   I don't have a motive yet.
[02:25:53.620 --> 02:25:55.020]   Why?
[02:25:55.020 --> 02:25:56.680]   Because I'm fine.
[02:25:56.680 --> 02:25:59.360]   I don't depend on that to define myself.
[02:25:59.360 --> 02:26:03.420]   I'm a human being, but if I don't have that sense of worth,
[02:26:03.420 --> 02:26:06.140]   I'm already like geared towards, I need to do this.
[02:26:06.140 --> 02:26:07.120]   I need to prove this.
[02:26:07.120 --> 02:26:08.380]   I have this agenda.
[02:26:08.380 --> 02:26:10.900]   And this is how we get all the lies in the world
[02:26:10.900 --> 02:26:13.740]   and all the problems and difficulties.
[02:26:13.740 --> 02:26:17.580]   So these practices, they are related to it
[02:26:17.580 --> 02:26:22.580]   to prove this, that, this way, why we need muscles for X, Y, Z
[02:26:22.580 --> 02:26:28.920]   and a lot of the reported outcomes
[02:26:28.920 --> 02:26:32.420]   are often from my places like funny.
[02:26:32.420 --> 02:26:33.940]   I hear about something like,
[02:26:33.940 --> 02:26:36.680]   I heard you say about gratitude practice.
[02:26:36.680 --> 02:26:41.760]   That actually experiencing from outside
[02:26:41.760 --> 02:26:44.280]   is if somebody else or you are receiving gratitude
[02:26:44.280 --> 02:26:45.580]   is actually more powerful.
[02:26:46.520 --> 02:26:48.900]   It's true, but I see why it's true.
[02:26:48.900 --> 02:26:50.640]   I'm not sure everybody sees it.
[02:26:50.640 --> 02:26:53.340]   If somebody tries to feel gratitude,
[02:26:53.340 --> 02:26:57.760]   just sit with the eyes closed or watch a movie
[02:26:57.760 --> 02:27:00.480]   and sense the gratitude there, it would be clear to you.
[02:27:00.480 --> 02:27:03.840]   One is very difficult to do and the other is very easy.
[02:27:03.840 --> 02:27:06.480]   Hence, if gratitude is achieved easier this way,
[02:27:06.480 --> 02:27:08.420]   that's why it works like that.
[02:27:08.420 --> 02:27:11.320]   Although all the traditional practices are about you
[02:27:11.320 --> 02:27:16.440]   and by challenging yourself to sense that gratitude yourself,
[02:27:16.440 --> 02:27:17.840]   they achieve much more powerful thing,
[02:27:17.840 --> 02:27:20.280]   but this is not the research people,
[02:27:20.280 --> 02:27:21.520]   the people in the research.
[02:27:21.520 --> 02:27:23.480]   We don't have a lot of those people.
[02:27:23.480 --> 02:27:27.320]   So a lot of the things that can arrive to us,
[02:27:27.320 --> 02:27:29.560]   weight training, the benefits,
[02:27:29.560 --> 02:27:34.080]   or the way that the hormonal effects,
[02:27:34.080 --> 02:27:37.280]   the effect over cognition, et cetera.
[02:27:37.280 --> 02:27:39.720]   When you open a bit and you go far out,
[02:27:39.720 --> 02:27:42.440]   you see certain things, not the truth,
[02:27:42.440 --> 02:27:44.480]   but maybe less delusion.
[02:27:45.760 --> 02:27:48.000]   There is nothing definite,
[02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:53.000]   but there is something maybe more wholesome that appears.
[02:27:53.000 --> 02:28:01.160]   Yeah, I think this is,
[02:28:01.160 --> 02:28:04.460]   so this is a state of exploration.
[02:28:04.460 --> 02:28:09.880]   I don't want to have the same thought if I already had it.
[02:28:09.880 --> 02:28:14.320]   Why would I want to have the same thought?
[02:28:14.320 --> 02:28:15.280]   I already had it.
[02:28:16.020 --> 02:28:18.600]   I don't want to have the same practice.
[02:28:18.600 --> 02:28:20.120]   I don't want it.
[02:28:20.120 --> 02:28:22.280]   I curled already in this way.
[02:28:22.280 --> 02:28:23.880]   I want to experience something else.
[02:28:23.880 --> 02:28:26.680]   I want to, there is a benefit to gain.
[02:28:26.680 --> 02:28:27.980]   No, but that was better.
[02:28:27.980 --> 02:28:34.600]   The better is better is not more, is not faster.
[02:28:34.600 --> 02:28:40.160]   Better is better and better isn't,
[02:28:40.160 --> 02:28:41.920]   we don't know what better is, right?
[02:28:41.920 --> 02:28:43.440]   So it's like, it's open.
[02:28:43.440 --> 02:28:45.680]   Oh, this is better, I don't know.
[02:28:45.680 --> 02:28:47.020]   It's just more weight.
[02:28:47.020 --> 02:28:48.180]   It's one more kilo.
[02:28:48.180 --> 02:28:50.080]   But maybe if I remove one kilo,
[02:28:50.080 --> 02:28:54.800]   I discover something like, for example,
[02:28:54.800 --> 02:28:58.880]   power development that has been shown
[02:28:58.880 --> 02:29:01.400]   to gain certain benefits when you lighten the load
[02:29:01.400 --> 02:29:03.920]   and you accelerate it more in certain conditions.
[02:29:03.920 --> 02:29:04.960]   But who discovered it?
[02:29:04.960 --> 02:29:07.340]   A practitioner, a met person.
[02:29:07.340 --> 02:29:11.400]   Not Verkhoshensky, Zatsyorsky.
[02:29:11.400 --> 02:29:16.320]   They reported something, but it was already
[02:29:16.320 --> 02:29:19.080]   within the grasp of the practitioners.
[02:29:19.080 --> 02:29:24.080]   And I think, and as a researcher, this is very powerful.
[02:29:24.080 --> 02:29:27.480]   To remind yourself this and to work with that,
[02:29:27.480 --> 02:29:29.600]   and as a practitioner, as a living human being,
[02:29:29.600 --> 02:29:32.600]   for everyone, I think something very useful.
[02:29:32.600 --> 02:29:35.360]   And then those plays that you're doing,
[02:29:35.360 --> 02:29:40.620]   people give you the weird looks and it's like,
[02:29:40.620 --> 02:29:43.000]   yeah, I tell people, you don't wanna be normal.
[02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:46.420]   If you don't get the weird looks,
[02:29:46.420 --> 02:29:49.180]   you're not moving in the right direction.
[02:29:49.180 --> 02:29:53.560]   You're moving in a very fixed and,
[02:29:53.560 --> 02:29:55.600]   you already know the result of that direction,
[02:29:55.600 --> 02:29:57.440]   let's say at least that.
[02:29:57.440 --> 02:30:00.960]   So continue to play with that, continue to play,
[02:30:00.960 --> 02:30:03.540]   look elsewhere, look at places you didn't look at,
[02:30:03.540 --> 02:30:05.480]   because this is still like within the same layer,
[02:30:05.480 --> 02:30:07.840]   one foot in front, one foot behind.
[02:30:07.840 --> 02:30:10.920]   What happens when you do it with a smile?
[02:30:10.920 --> 02:30:14.360]   The same workout, and when you do it with a frown.
[02:30:14.360 --> 02:30:20.340]   Or what happens, breath-holding or blood restrictions?
[02:30:20.340 --> 02:30:25.340]   All this is great play and I think very beneficial
[02:30:25.340 --> 02:30:26.580]   to do, to go through.
[02:30:26.580 --> 02:30:28.860]   - Love it.
[02:30:28.860 --> 02:30:31.560]   I think it's a wonderful message.
[02:30:31.560 --> 02:30:34.760]   What I keep hearing from you over and over again is to,
[02:30:34.760 --> 02:30:39.100]   that people should explore, explore, explore.
[02:30:39.100 --> 02:30:44.100]   And listen, I wanna thank you for your time today,
[02:30:44.100 --> 02:30:47.640]   first of all, for the incredible teachings here
[02:30:47.640 --> 02:30:50.120]   at this table, but also the introduction
[02:30:50.120 --> 02:30:52.120]   to a movement practice.
[02:30:52.120 --> 02:30:53.200]   Although now I'm tempted to say
[02:30:53.200 --> 02:30:54.520]   that I've been moving my whole life.
[02:30:54.520 --> 02:30:57.940]   I just didn't know I was, that it was such a vast landscape.
[02:30:57.940 --> 02:31:03.860]   Also that your willingness to tread out in this journey
[02:31:03.860 --> 02:31:06.220]   that is truly unique.
[02:31:06.220 --> 02:31:08.540]   The greatest compliment that one can give in science
[02:31:08.540 --> 02:31:10.460]   is the one that I'm gonna tell you now,
[02:31:10.460 --> 02:31:11.760]   because it's entirely appropriate,
[02:31:11.760 --> 02:31:14.420]   which is we say you're an N of one, right?
[02:31:14.420 --> 02:31:16.040]   That, and you truly are.
[02:31:16.040 --> 02:31:19.820]   I don't think there's anyone that has been as willing
[02:31:19.820 --> 02:31:23.040]   to embrace existing practices, evolve them,
[02:31:23.040 --> 02:31:28.020]   create new practices, and to share so broadly
[02:31:28.020 --> 02:31:31.140]   to really be willing to give and teach so much knowledge.
[02:31:31.140 --> 02:31:33.620]   You know, earlier you made the mention of your goals
[02:31:33.620 --> 02:31:37.440]   of in part of being wild and wise,
[02:31:37.440 --> 02:31:41.200]   and I'm here to tell you that you are both wild and wise.
[02:31:41.200 --> 02:31:43.060]   And so thank you so much.
[02:31:43.060 --> 02:31:44.900]   - Thank you very much, thank you.
[02:31:44.900 --> 02:31:46.860]   - Thank you for joining me today for my discussion
[02:31:46.860 --> 02:31:48.800]   about the science and practice of movement
[02:31:48.800 --> 02:31:51.500]   and movement culture with Ido Portal.
[02:31:51.500 --> 02:31:54.340]   If you'd like to learn more about Ido and his workshops
[02:31:54.340 --> 02:31:56.480]   and other aspects of what he does,
[02:31:56.480 --> 02:31:58.020]   please go to his social media.
[02:31:58.020 --> 02:32:03.020]   His Instagram handle is Portal, P-O-R-T-A-L dot Ido, I-D-O.
[02:32:03.940 --> 02:32:06.500]   You can also go to IdoPortal.com,
[02:32:06.500 --> 02:32:08.820]   and there are a tremendous number of resources
[02:32:08.820 --> 02:32:12.060]   that will lead you to more information about what he does.

[02:32:44.240 --> 02:32:45.800]   at the beginning of today's podcast.
[02:32:45.800 --> 02:32:48.200]   That's the best way to support this podcast.
[02:32:48.200 --> 02:32:50.600]   Not on today's episode, but on many previous episodes
[02:32:50.600 --> 02:32:53.340]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we discuss supplements.
[02:32:53.340 --> 02:32:55.480]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:32:55.480 --> 02:32:57.560]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:32:57.560 --> 02:33:00.320]   or could derive tremendous benefit from them.
[02:33:00.320 --> 02:33:02.200]   For that reason, the Huberman Lab Podcast
[02:33:02.200 --> 02:33:04.680]   has decided to partner with Momentus.
[02:33:04.680 --> 02:33:07.080]   We decided to partner with Momentus because first of all,
[02:33:07.080 --> 02:33:09.000]   they are of the absolute highest quality.
[02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:11.040]   Second of all, they ship anywhere in the world.
[02:33:11.040 --> 02:33:13.040]   And third, we wanted to have one site
[02:33:13.040 --> 02:33:14.780]   that people could go to where they could find
[02:33:14.780 --> 02:33:17.020]   the supplements that are discussed on this podcast
[02:33:17.020 --> 02:33:19.720]   in the various dosages and single ingredient forms
[02:33:19.720 --> 02:33:23.500]   that we often suggest or point people to on the podcast.
[02:33:23.500 --> 02:33:25.440]   So if you'd like to see the supplements that I take
[02:33:25.440 --> 02:33:27.420]   or that have been mentioned on the podcast,
[02:33:27.420 --> 02:33:30.340]   please go to livemomentus.com/huberman
[02:33:30.340 --> 02:33:32.900]   and they're listed there as well as available there.
[02:33:32.900 --> 02:33:35.260]   If you're not already following us on social media,
[02:33:35.260 --> 02:33:38.740]   we are @hubermanlab on both Instagram and Twitter.
[02:33:38.740 --> 02:33:41.080]   Both places I do short posts about science
[02:33:41.080 --> 02:33:43.300]   and science-related tools, some of which overlap
[02:33:43.300 --> 02:33:45.420]   with the content of the Huberman Lab Podcast
[02:33:45.420 --> 02:33:47.960]   and other of which is distinct from the information
[02:33:47.960 --> 02:33:49.140]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[02:33:49.140 --> 02:33:50.720]   So again, that's @hubermanlab on Twitter
[02:33:50.720 --> 02:33:52.580]   and @hubermanlab on Instagram.
[02:33:52.580 --> 02:33:55.220]   We also have a newsletter that many people find useful.
[02:33:55.220 --> 02:33:57.280]   This is a completely zero cost newsletter.
[02:33:57.280 --> 02:33:59.260]   You can find it by going to hubermanlab.com,
[02:33:59.260 --> 02:34:00.860]   click on the menu and go to newsletter
[02:34:00.860 --> 02:34:01.960]   and you sign up with your email.
[02:34:01.960 --> 02:34:03.780]   We do not share your email with anybody
[02:34:03.780 --> 02:34:06.720]   and we have a very clear privacy policy listed there.
[02:34:06.720 --> 02:34:09.260]   You can also get access at the very same site
[02:34:09.260 --> 02:34:12.480]   to newsletters from the past to see if those newsletters
[02:34:12.480 --> 02:34:14.140]   are indeed of interest to you.
[02:34:14.140 --> 02:34:16.700]   We have newsletters about a toolkit for sleep, for instance,
[02:34:16.700 --> 02:34:19.060]   or a neuroplasticity super protocol
[02:34:19.060 --> 02:34:21.300]   that incorporates a lot of different podcast episodes
[02:34:21.300 --> 02:34:23.620]   and themes that you might find useful.
[02:34:23.620 --> 02:34:26.300]   Again, that's hubermanlab.com and go to the menu
[02:34:26.300 --> 02:34:28.540]   and click on newsletter and sign up.
[02:34:28.540 --> 02:34:30.640]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:34:30.640 --> 02:34:32.480]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:34:32.480 --> 02:34:35.060]   [upbeat music]
[02:34:35.060 --> 02:34:37.640]   (upbeat music)
