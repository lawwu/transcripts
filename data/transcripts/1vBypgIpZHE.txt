[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.380]   - Today is July 4th, which is Independence Day
[00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:08.520]   here in the United States,
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.040]   and Matt writes in to ask this question.
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.180]   Obviously as Christians,
[00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.060]   we are to live as pilgrims on this earth.
[00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.800]   Is there an appropriate place in the Christian life
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.060]   for patriotism?
[00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.440]   - Yes, there is.
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.200]   And it's right, we are pilgrims.
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.560]   We're called exiles, we're refugees,
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.920]   we're sojourners, 1 Peter 2.
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.200]   Beloved, I urge you as sojourners and exiles,
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.760]   abstain from the passions that wage war
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.720]   against your flesh, or Philippians 3,
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.580]   our citizenship is in heaven.
[00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.080]   So the question is framed rightly.
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.520]   We are citizens of heaven.
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.520]   We are sojourners and pilgrims on the earth.
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.160]   And that's owing to the fact that this world is fallen,
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.040]   not the fact that it's created.
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.720]   We're gonna spend eternity in a created world,
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.320]   but Satan won't be the God of that world anymore.
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.480]   That's what makes us feel so alien here
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.080]   is that the God of this world is Satan.
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.360]   He holds such extensive sway.
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.000]   The world is permeated with sin.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.880]   It makes us feel like we're not at home.
[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.000]   We're just aching that we be done with sin
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.120]   and be in the presence of holiness.
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.600]   So when I say we're aliens and exiles
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.080]   and sojourners and pilgrims,
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.400]   I don't mean that the earth is a place we despise.
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.280]   I mean that the structures we find ourselves in
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.000]   are so permeated with sin, we want something new.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   However, God means for us to be enmeshed in this world.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.560]   We are not of the world, but we are in the world,
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.120]   and we're supposed to be in it.
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.120]   We're in a city and we're in a state,
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.120]   and we're in a country and we're in a continent.
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.120]   And if I ask, now what is patriotism in this enmeshment?
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.880]   My answer is that patriotism is a special love
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.720]   for fatherland, could be a city,
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.160]   might love your city in a special way,
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.600]   a state, a country, a tribe, an ethnicity.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.520]   And that love is different from the general love
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.840]   that Christians have for everybody or for the whole earth.
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.320]   And the reason I think that's true,
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.840]   that there is and it's good that there is
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.400]   special affections for our homeland,
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.740]   is that the Bible seems to point in that direction
[00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.000]   in several ways.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.640]   Here's an example.
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.000]   Paul in Galatians 6 said, "As you have opportunity,
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.720]   "do good to everyone, especially to those
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.840]   "who are of the household of faith."
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.180]   It's as though there's this specialness
[00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.080]   about those that are close to you,
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.180]   and there's a kind of affection for them that is different.
[00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.580]   Or 1 Timothy 5, verse eight,
[00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.000]   "If anyone does not provide for his relatives,
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.800]   "and especially for the members of his household,
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.000]   "he's denied the faith."
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.240]   So it seems like it's right,
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.160]   not just to have this general love
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.600]   spread over the whole world,
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.920]   and everybody has exactly the same affections from us,
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.800]   but rather there's an especially.
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.720]   And we know that Paul in Romans 9 said that
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.920]   if he could, he'd be accursed and cut off from Christ
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.720]   for the sake of my brothers, my kinsmen,
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.780]   according to the flesh.
[00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.960]   So there's something about this fleshness,
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.880]   this being bound together in a family way
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.840]   or a cultural way with a group that makes us love them
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.000]   with an unusual kind of affection.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.960]   And as I was thinking about it,
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.200]   Lewis, C.S. Lewis gave me some help
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.160]   because Lewis wrote this book, "The Four Loves,"
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:06.160]   and philos, friendship, and eros, sex,
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.920]   and agape, the love of God.
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.320]   And the one that I think is relevant here is storge.
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.280]   Storge is affection.
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.040]   It's what you feel for a pair of slippers
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.760]   that your wife thinks you should have thrown away
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.720]   a long time ago, but they fit just right.
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.480]   Or an old raggedy doll that a kid wants to keep
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.920]   even though it's just no good for anything except that kid.
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.760]   Or a sweater with holes in it
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.000]   that you've worn to read and study in for years.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.280]   Or an old tree where you carved your initials
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.880]   as a young couple and you just love to go back to that tree.
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.360]   You love to watch that tree.
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.000]   That tree means more than other trees.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.040]   Or the lagoon where Noelle and I were engaged
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.760]   has a special place.
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.040]   So there's a kind of affection for a tree
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:06.000]   or a sweater or slippers, and for a city,
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.840]   and for a fatherland, a language, a culture.
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:09.680]   Why?
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.000]   Because it fits you.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.920]   When you leave it, get on a plane, go to another country,
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:19.200]   there could be excitement and challenge and stimulation.
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.120]   You may even find those other cultures superior
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.560]   in some ways to your own.
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.560]   But when you come home, it fits like the slippers fit.
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.240]   It's just full of good associations
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.040]   like that tree where you carved your initials.
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:41.000]   So it seems to me that this is good
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.240]   and the goodness is implied in those especiallys
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.080]   in the Bible.
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.320]   God created us to be in skin and in languages
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.920]   and in cultures.
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:56.120]   He doesn't mean for us to despise our skin
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.960]   and our languages and our cultures,
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.800]   but to be at home in them and to feel good about them.
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.560]   And when I think of other passages
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.360]   that point in the direction of patriotism,
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:13.360]   Romans 13 surely implies some kind of patronism
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:18.000]   because Romans 13, when it says submit to those in authority
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.840]   implies that a government, a country, a state
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:27.480]   has the right to use the sword to maintain order
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.720]   and to defend itself against aggression.
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.480]   And if it does, that means God is saying
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.760]   it has a right to be.
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:38.240]   And if it has a right to be and to preserve what it is,
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.560]   then the people who live there give approval to that.
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.960]   They say, we like that, we're glad that we are
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.880]   and that we are culturally the way we are.
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:51.160]   And they can say that without putting down other cultures.
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.080]   You don't have to be negative about England
[00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.900]   because you're pro-America in the sense of loving
[00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:02.200]   some of the distinctives that God has made in this place.
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.800]   So I think I would probably wrap it up by saying
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.280]   whatever form your patriotism takes,
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:14.280]   let it be with a deep sense that we are more closely bound
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:19.680]   to brothers in Christ in other countries and other cultures
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:23.960]   than we are to our closest unbelieving compatriot
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.200]   in the fatherland.
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.440]   God is our King and no man,
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.800]   his kingdom is our final allegiance.
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:35.800]   But under that banner, it is right to be thankful
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.680]   that God gave us our land freely,
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.880]   thankful that people paid a high price to preserve it
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.900]   and thankful that we have these slippers
[00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:46.960]   that feel so comfortable.
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:48.640]   - That's a wonderful reminder for us
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.800]   on this Independence Day in the United States.
