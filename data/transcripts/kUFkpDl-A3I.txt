[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.480]   Miracles surround our lives, physical miracles that we can see and hear and touch and taste.
[00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.580]   But what is the point of those physical gifts and visual miracles that abundantly surround
[00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:17.580]   our lives?
[00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.560]   It's a theme Pastor John took up in a sermon earlier in the year titled, "God's Peculiar
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.920]   Glory, How We Know the Bible is True," a message delivered in Houston.
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.560]   Here's a clip of what Pastor John said in that message.
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.600]   Psalm 19.1, the analogy of nature.
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.760]   The heavens are telling the glory of God.
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:46.920]   Psalm 19.1, the heavens are telling the glory of God.
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:01:00.320]   That means God expects you to look at the stars, sun, moon, galaxies, cosmos, and by
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.640]   implication I think subatomic particles and the universe within as well as the universe
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:17.640]   about, all the majestic, incredible, amazing world that God made and he expects you to
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.640]   see the glory of God.
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.400]   But here's the catch.
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.320]   The glory of nature is not the glory of God.
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.520]   It points to the glory of God.
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.840]   It echoes the glory of God.
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:43.200]   It leads to the glory of God because Einstein looked at the glory of the heavens and went
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:50.520]   to church and said, "I have seen so much more glory than the preachers.
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.440]   I don't think they know what they're talking about."
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.720]   When I read that about 20 years ago, I thought, "God, I don't want ever anybody to say that
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:59.720]   about me.
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:06.120]   Please, God, don't let anybody say that when they hear me preach that I just look up in
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.680]   the night sky and I've seen a bigger God than Piper has."
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.680]   Any of you preachers here, make that a resolution.
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.680]   That'll never happen.
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.320]   God willing, that'll never happen.
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.840]   All that to say Einstein was not a believer and he saw glory and he didn't see the glory
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.160]   of God.
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.200]   So what does it mean?
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.280]   The heavens are telling the glory of God.
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.040]   I think it means there are eyes here and there are eyes here.
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:43.960]   And for those who have eyes to see, when these eyes see, these eyes see through.
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.840]   And you know beyond the shadow of a doubt, God made that.
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.240]   I mean, have you ever been like me?
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.760]   I mean, I'm walking to church.
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.840]   I've got a path I walk to church.
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.760]   I probably walked it 10,000 times over the last 35 years.
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.120]   I have a seven-minute walk from my church, 600 paces door to door.
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.960]   I know the trees, I know the apartments, I know this walk, do it blindfolded.
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.680]   And there are seasons of the year when the apple blossoms are coming.
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.680]   I know the weekend, I know the concert that always happens on that weekend.
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.160]   I mean, everything is beautiful.
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:23.000]   And I try sometimes not to believe that God made this tree.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.760]   I look at this tree, 80 feet tall, branches that probably weigh as much as five cars,
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.000]   and it's March and 80 feet up there, little buds are coming out, and there's no heart
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.720]   pumping in this tree.
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.240]   Pushing the sap 80 feet into the air.
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.120]   I mean, I get blood.
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.640]   Feet to head, feet to head.
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.160]   Sap, I don't get that.
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.800]   You can call it capillarity or whatever.
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.440]   I say, "That's a miracle."
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:03.080]   Now, even if you explain it, like put a name on it, capillarity,
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.000]   I think, "That helps."
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.520]   I cannot not believe God made that tree.
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.200]   Now, you may think that's naive.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.600]   I think when I stand at the Judgment Day and all the nations are gathered,
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:23.320]   and I'm standing there before the living God, and God looks out over all the atheists
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.680]   who didn't believe God made the trees, they're going to look ridiculous.
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.680]   Amen.
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.600]   God help us to see and see through.
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.520]   This short sermon clip was taken for John Piper's message on April 28th of this year.
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.080]   It's titled, "God's Peculiar Glory, How We Know the Bible is True."
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.800]   And it's named after Pastor John's new book, A Peculiar Glory, which you can find and download
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.280]   free of charge entirely from our site, DesiringGod.org.
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.560]   I hope you'll pick it up and read it.
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.080]   Well, we get a lot of emails from you listeners every month, and I doubt there's a more common
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.640]   question over the years than the question about blaspheming the Holy Spirit, the unpardonable
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.000]   sin.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.760]   Can Christians be guilty of this unforgivable sin or not?
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.120]   This is huge, and it's tomorrow.
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.400]   I'm your host, Tony Ranke.
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.040]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John Podcast with John Piper.
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.540]   [END]
[00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:24.540]   John Piper's "God's Peculiar Glory, How We Know the Bible is True" is available as a podcast on iTunes.
