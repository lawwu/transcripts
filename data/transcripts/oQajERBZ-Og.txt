[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   What gets you out of bed in the morning?
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.560]   Is it a paycheck, a to-do list, or something bigger?
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.080]   As Simon Sinek puts it,
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.000]   "People who have a clear sense of purpose
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.200]   tend to live more inspired, more fulfilled, and more joyful lives."
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.240]   In today's episode, we'll dive deep into the power of purpose,
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.480]   why friendship is the ultimate biohack,
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.560]   and the fundamental human skills we should all be working on but probably aren't.
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.160]   We're talking about what really drives us, how friendships shape our lives,
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.000]   and the simple but often overlooked skills that make relationships stronger.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.080]   I'm Chris Hutchins. If you enjoy this episode,

[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:42.000]   Simon, it's been a long time since you wrote Start With Why,
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.240]   but it's how I first got connected with you.
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.600]   So I just want to ask,
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.200]   why is it important for someone to figure out their purpose and their why?
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.520]   I mean, why did you get out of bed this morning?
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.120]   And why should anyone care?
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.400]   And that's sort of what purpose is.
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.200]   It's a reason to get out of bed beyond I have to,
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.320]   I got to make a living, or the kids are screaming downstairs.
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.200]   You know, it's a reason to take on the day.
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.720]   It's a filter for decisions we make.
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.400]   And what all the science shows, I'm not unique here,
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.160]   for millennia past and all the way into the future,
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.080]   is that people who have a clear sense of purpose
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.760]   tend to live more inspired, more fulfilled, and more joyful lives.
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.480]   What percent of people do you think don't ever figure that out?
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.200]   If you had to guess?
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.040]   The vast majority.
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:37.520]   I think most people go through life like it's a lottery.
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.760]   You know, like you sort of like playing the numbers, doing the thing.
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.520]   And hopefully, every now and then,
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.960]   you get a little burst of something.
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.560]   And it feels great.
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.000]   You're in flow or whatever it is.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.840]   And then you go back to sort of playing the numbers every day
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.680]   and hope tomorrow.
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.560]   Whereas I think when people start with why,
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.800]   when people live with a sense of purpose, cause, or belief,
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:59.600]   it's not a lottery.
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.720]   It's more of a jigsaw puzzle.
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:01.840]   I live in Silicon Valley.
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.880]   And I think there's a lot of people I know who have their why.
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.320]   And they're like, "I want to change the world.
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.640]   I want to build a plane that goes supersonic speeds,"
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.080]   which happened last week.
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.280]   How important is it that that purpose someone has
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.280]   is to advance humanity versus something more related to family or friends
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.600]   and enjoying life or hiking or something?
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.880]   So a why is not making a supersonic plane.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.560]   That's not a purpose, right?
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.120]   That's a goal.
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.960]   That's wonderful.
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.280]   But people have a clear sense of purpose.
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.120]   It's the reason your friends love you.
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.840]   It's the reason your clients like you.
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.480]   And the tangible things that they may do,
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.480]   call it your job, your career,
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.440]   those are the tangible things that bring your purpose to life.
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.680]   So I wrote a bunch of books, right?
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.960]   Why?
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.720]   Because it brings my purpose to life.
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.480]   I wrote about things that manifest,
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.800]   that give tangibility to what I believe,
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.240]   which is my purpose is to inspire people to do the things that inspire them.
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.960]   So together, each of us can change our worlds for the better.
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.040]   And everything I do breathes life into that purpose.
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.400]   Purpose is the foundation.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.280]   And so I get a huge kick out of, especially Silicon Valley,
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.520]   when they're like, "Simon, I know my why.
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.600]   I'm going to change the world," as you said,
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:14.960]   "with my pizza delivery app."
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.360]   I'm like, "Okay, let's go with that."
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.560]   Is that the reason your friends love you?
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.600]   Or my other favorite one is like,
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.200]   "I have a why for work and I have a why for home."
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.440]   I'm like, "Well, in one of those two places, you're lying."
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.160]   Because you are you,
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.200]   whether you change your clothes or change your desk, you know?
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.440]   So you only have one why.
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.400]   It's fully formed by the mid to late teens.
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.920]   And you are who you are.
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.160]   We are all products of how we were raised.
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.120]   The experiences we had when we were young made you who you are.
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.320]   And now the opportunity is,
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.480]   are you living to the max potential of who you are?
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.400]   Are you operating at your natural best?
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.760]   And people who learn their why, they have an unfair advantage.
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.360]   I've heard you multiple times reference,
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.920]   you know, "It's why your friends love you."
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.640]   Are friends the easiest way for us to identify what that is?
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.360]   It's a way.
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.520]   I mean, I do this little thing called a friends exercise
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.640]   that absolutely leverages the love of your friends.
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.920]   Really quickly, you know,
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.080]   find a friend who loves you and you love your friend.
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.840]   You'd be there for them till three o'clock in the morning,
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:16.960]   and they'd be there for you.
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.160]   Do not do this with a sibling.
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.280]   Do not do this with a parent.
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.640]   Do not do this with one of your kids.
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.160]   Those relationships are too close.
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.280]   Best friend.
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.480]   You want a best friend.
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.680]   And you ask them the simple question,
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.040]   "Why are we friends?"
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.200]   And they're going to look at you like you're insane.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.640]   Because the part of the brain that controls our feelings,
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.720]   like love, doesn't control language.
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.320]   It's very hard to put our feelings into words,
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.160]   which is why we speak in metaphors and analogies
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.760]   when we talk about our feelings.
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.440]   And so they're going to hem and haw and be like,
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.000]   "I don't know."
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.760]   Well, of course they know.
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:44.960]   They just can't put it into words.
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.080]   And then, interestingly, you stop asking the question, "Why?"
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.200]   And you ask the question, "What?"
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.000]   Come on, "What specifically is it about me
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.320]   that I know you would be there for me no matter what?"
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.880]   And they will start to try and describe you.
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:57.680]   "I don't know.
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.280]   You're loyal.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.000]   You're honest.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.360]   I trust you.
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.600]   And you play devil's advocate."
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.840]   Good.
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.600]   You get that from a lot of people.
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.200]   That's just the definition of a friend.
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.960]   What specifically is about me that I know you'd be there for me no matter what?
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.600]   And they're going to go through a few rounds of this.
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:14.240]   Don't help them.
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.840]   Don't let anybody else help them.
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.200]   And eventually, they will give up.
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.600]   And they will start describing themselves.
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.600]   And this is what my friend said to me.
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.720]   "Look, Simon, I don't know.
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.200]   All I know is I can sit in a room with you.
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.600]   I don't even have to talk to you when I feel inspired."
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.960]   And I got goosebumps.
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.160]   I had an emotional response to what they were telling me.
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.240]   In other words, that's when they tapped my why.
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.680]   That's when they pinpointed.
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.440]   And so when you do this exercise with people,
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.000]   and I did it with multiple friends, and you can do it with multiple friends,
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.160]   they will say very similar, if not the exact same thing,
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.800]   because the thing that I admit, the thing that I give to the world,
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.120]   my purpose, my cause, my belief, my why is the space I fill in their lives,
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.800]   which is why they'll say consistent things.
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.480]   And when they say that, you will well up with tears or have goosebumps
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.800]   or some reaction, and that's how you know you've hit it.
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.720]   To inspire people to do the things that inspire them.
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.440]   Yeah, that's the greatest compliment you can pay me is,
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.000]   "Simon, thank you.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.800]   That was inspiring."
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.280]   It's the thing that makes me feel like I'm on the right path.
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.280]   By asking yourself similar questions?
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:15.200]   Or would you say having a friend to talk to is probably the better way to figure it out?
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.480]   Because like you said, a lot of questions.
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.880]   None of us have objectivity about ourselves.
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:19.520]   That's the problem.
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:24.240]   We have dreams, we have aspirations, we have egos, we have insecurities.
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.320]   But it's very hard for us to know how the world sees us and perceives us and needs us.
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.720]   We just don't know.
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:35.280]   We have a little bit of self-awareness, but we don't have total self-awareness.
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.120]   We definitely don't have objectivity.
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.960]   Some of us are too good to ourselves and some of us are too mean to ourselves.
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.920]   As you're saying this, I'm thinking of little moments in my life
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:47.280]   where I get tremendous joy doing something that I don't know why.
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:51.440]   If a friend asked me for a restaurant recommendation,
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:56.080]   all I want to do is have this person be delighted in a way they've never imagined.
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:02.080]   Sometimes it just falls so hard on its face and I'm kind of let down.
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:07.200]   I remember this one time where Uber had just launched in the Bay Area many years ago.
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:11.360]   My in-laws grew up in Wisconsin, live in Colorado.
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.720]   They came out and I was like, "I have all this credit from the company I worked at.
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.640]   I'm going to pick them up in a town car."
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:17.440]   It was like a limo.
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.560]   They came home and I was like, "What do they think?"
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:24.560]   My father-in-law says, "It was so nice of you to get us a cab from the airport."
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.360]   And I was like, "Ugh!"
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.520]   Trying to create experiences to delight people
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:34.880]   and show them things they've never seen before is something I love doing.
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.600]   Is that even relevant or is that just a thing I love
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.920]   or do I need to go deeper to figure it out?
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.200]   Definitely relevant.
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.000]   The fact that you said, "I love," that's an emotional word.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.520]   Like is rational, love is emotional.
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.280]   Do you love your wife?
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.160]   I like her a lot.
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.080]   Those are not the same.
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.520]   When somebody says, "I love doing that," yeah, it's not necessarily the answer,
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.480]   but it's definitely something that I pay attention to.
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.960]   It's definitely a flag when I'm helping somebody find their wife, for sure.
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.560]   You've written a lot about friendship lately.
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:07.440]   What fascinates you about friendship?
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.000]   First of all, we're social animals, so we all need them.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.600]   You're not going to get through this thing called life without them,
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:14.880]   at least not successfully.
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:16.880]   If you look at the world we live in right now,
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:21.920]   with rising rates of depression and anxiety,
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.680]   inability to cope with stress,
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.600]   and the worst case scenario, suicide,
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.000]   what you find is that friendship fixes all those things.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.400]   It's the ultimate biohack.
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.200]   Even the obsession with longevity.
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:38.720]   You've got everybody talking about diets and exercises and supplements,
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:42.320]   and yet nobody's talking about friends.
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.320]   If you look at all the blue zones and all of those things,
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.920]   yes, they're eating these Mediterranean diets.
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.320]   Yes, they walk a lot, but they also commune.
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.440]   They also eat with friends.
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.640]   They also walk with friends.
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.000]   I've met so many people who've lived to old age
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.440]   who didn't do any of the things that the biohackers in Hollywood do,
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.360]   and they're in their 90s, and they're happy, and they're healthy,
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:00.400]   and they're walking around,
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:03.920]   and you hear them laugh and talk about their friends.
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:10.160]   I think that we forget about friendship because it's a little more amorphous.
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.640]   You can't measure it as easily.
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.560]   We live in a metrics-obsessed world.
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:18.160]   You've got your sleep aids and your Fitbits and your Oura rings,
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.680]   and we're so metrics-obsessed,
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.920]   we forget that some of the harder-to-measure,
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:26.480]   more qualitative, beautiful things in life
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:29.360]   actually contribute to our health more than we realize.
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:34.000]   It's funny because my grandparents moved to a retirement community when they were 52
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.840]   and lived there for 40 years till their mid-90s.
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:42.000]   I look at the other side of the family, totally the opposite.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.120]   Health wasn't as strong.
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.880]   Gosh, I just look at that.
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.440]   I'm like, "They just had more friends than I do."
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.120]   And they ate chocolate cake.
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:51.120]   Yeah, they lived in Kansas.
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.520]   And they ate fried chicken and barbecue.
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:56.000]   Three Dr. Peppers a day.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.600]   Three Dr. Peppers a day.
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.760]   Maybe they took some supplements that the doctor told them to take.
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:05.120]   But they went through life because one of the things that friends do
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:07.520]   is they reduce our stress, right?
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.200]   The cortisol goes down.
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.640]   And there's data on this, right?
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:14.000]   Which is people who stress about having chocolate cake,
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.480]   that the cortisol, the stress releases, is worse for us than the chocolate cake.
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.160]   That doesn't mean you eat chocolate cake with every meal.
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.960]   And it means have a few bites, not a whole freaking cake.
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.640]   There is a thing called moderation.
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:26.800]   But just enjoy yourself.
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:31.040]   One thing I noticed amongst at least my peers and friends and colleagues is
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:34.720]   somewhere in the mid to late 30s range,
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:39.280]   between the fact that we feel super connected because we're all online,
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:43.440]   but it's never been easier to move, and we've all had children.
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:47.200]   It feels like a lot of people I know have a lot of friends.
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.400]   And I put myself in this bucket.
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.440]   I'll be a little vulnerable.
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:53.120]   I don't feel like I have the friends that we're talking about here, right?
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:54.880]   I have lots of people I can give a phone call to,
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.320]   I can have dinner with, I can go out with.
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:00.320]   But growing up, I had three friends in the neighborhood.
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:01.520]   We'd hang out all the time.
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.160]   We didn't need to plan, and everything just worked.
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:11.280]   I feel like in a post-children world where we're all online and all connected,
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.200]   I just don't know if that happens as much.
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:18.880]   And it kind of all falls apart when you move and have kids and everyone's spread out.
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:24.000]   Well, friendship takes work, takes effort, takes time for it to work well.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.840]   And kids, like everything, take more work.
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:31.440]   And there's only X many hours in the day and X much energy you have.
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:34.560]   And so you take things away to focus on family.
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:35.280]   This is very common.
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:36.320]   I hear this all the time.
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.720]   Since they had kids, not all cases, but in many cases,
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:44.960]   you'll have a partner that I hope is your friend in raising the family.
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:48.880]   It's much more difficult without that partner.
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:53.280]   And at the end of the day, friendship requires a little effort.
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:54.400]   It requires a little time.
[00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:58.160]   And I think for people who have kids, then the question is,
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:01.520]   how do you reorganize and find, if you live in Los Angeles,
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:04.640]   sitting in the car, sitting in traffic is a great time to connect with friends.
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:05.520]   There are ways.
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:08.400]   One of the things I've learned, and I'm guilty of this,
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.960]   which is there's a friend I haven't connected with for a while.
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:11.680]   I've been so busy.
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.280]   I got to connect with them.
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:16.400]   And I'm like, okay, I only have like 15 minutes now.
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:17.680]   I'll wait till I have more time.
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.840]   Okay, I don't have like 30 minutes now.
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.440]   You know, I want to talk to him for an hour.
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.240]   Okay, I'm going to wait.
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:23.680]   And before I know it, a month has gone by.
[00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.640]   And I didn't call him, you know?
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:30.240]   And so one of the things I've started doing is just using small amounts of time.
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:33.280]   Like a text that says, I'm thinking of you.
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.120]   You can do that from the toilet, you know?
[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:38.400]   Why you're thinking about them in the toilet is a different conversation.
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:42.160]   Or I'll call somebody like, hey, listen, I've got 10 minutes between meetings.
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.120]   I've been talking a while.
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:46.080]   Just a little kind of quick check in, right?
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:49.200]   And it's amazing how much those things actually work.
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:52.960]   Do the kind of good relationships that you need for friendship to,
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:55.280]   you know, for a lot of the benefits you talked about,
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:56.960]   can that happen in a virtual world?
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:00.640]   Or can you have those great relationships from afar?
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:03.920]   We know the answer, which is in person is always better.
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:05.440]   You can hug someone.
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:08.880]   You can put your hand on their shoulder when they're struggling, right?
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:09.920]   One level down for that.
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:14.960]   I think the phone is way better than a video conference, you know?
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:19.920]   I find that people are way more present on the phone, right?
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:22.240]   Because you can tell when somebody wanders off on the phone,
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:24.000]   you'd be like, dude, are you listening?
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.440]   You're like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, right?
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:29.200]   Or when somebody wanders off on a video, it's where they start typing.
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:32.480]   It's like this weird rudeness that you can't say anything.
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.880]   And most of the time you're looking at yourself anyway.
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:38.320]   You're not even looking at them, you know?
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:40.560]   And if you are looking at them, it's fake eye contact.
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:42.080]   It's like, I'm looking at the camera.
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:44.720]   You think I'm looking at you, but I'm looking at a green dot.
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:49.040]   It's all slightly artificial, literally and figuratively.
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:52.480]   And so I find the phone is actually a fantastic way to connect with people.
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:56.080]   Yeah, I am notorious for randomly just calling people.
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.200]   Walking the dog, call someone.
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.240]   Go for a drive, call someone.
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:03.360]   But what I find missing more and more now is that all those people that I want to call,
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:06.480]   the close friends that I would call in the exercise at the beginning,
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:07.760]   none of them live nearby.
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:12.400]   And so I've got to almost rebuild my network of friends that I could go to
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:13.840]   for a hug and have dinner with.
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:19.440]   And I had this crazy idea that my wife didn't veto but kind of poked fun at,
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:21.040]   which is when we moved to this new neighborhood.
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:25.360]   I was like, what if we wrote a note and introduced ourselves to 100 people
[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:27.040]   and put it in all their mailboxes?
[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:29.440]   And this is my analytical side.
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:32.160]   I was like, and then we can go from not just being friends with
[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:33.440]   the person that lives next to us,
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:36.560]   but maybe there's an amazing family that we'd be best friends with,
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:37.760]   but they live three blocks away.
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:39.040]   How are we ever going to find them?
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:42.720]   What if we just drop all these notes and we go on like a speed dating process
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:44.720]   and we try to find these people?
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:47.520]   Because I thought it'd be really cool if we had these great close friends,
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:48.640]   but it would take time.
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:49.280]   What's your reaction?
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.280]   Is that crazy idea or is that like great?
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.760]   Well, let's reverse it.
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:55.040]   What if you got the note?
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:57.920]   How would you react?
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.640]   Hey, we just moved in three blocks away.
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:02.320]   Want to be friends?
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:06.480]   It's hard for me to imagine a world where I don't already have this idea,
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:08.080]   because if I got this note at this point,
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:09.520]   I'd be like, these are my people.
[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:10.560]   They didn't think that.
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:11.280]   That's true.
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:15.840]   And your poor wife would be like, just can you go and let me know how it is?
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:17.040]   That might be a personality thing.
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:19.440]   But at the very minimum, I think we should know our neighbors.
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:22.080]   You know, I think it's very important if you do move into a neighborhood
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:23.440]   or if somebody moves into your neighborhood,
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:25.760]   you can knock on the door and say, welcome, bring my cake.
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:27.760]   Or you go knock on the door and be like, hey, I just moved in next door.
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.120]   I just wanted to introduce myself.
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.680]   You know, neighbors, to know your neighbors, I think is a part of it.
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:35.280]   Look, at the end of the day, this is one of the struggles with urban centers, right?
[00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:38.240]   Which is we left our families and we left our friends and you said we had to rebuild.
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:43.440]   And now you live in these very densely populated, but very lonely places.
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:46.080]   And our networks are gone and we have to rebuild our networks.
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:49.520]   And the networks are loose because people are constantly moving,
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:51.600]   even within the city, you know?
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:57.760]   Whereas if you grew up in Kansas, the people who stay, stay.
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:01.280]   And the people next door, that's it, you know?
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:03.680]   Trevor Noah talks about this quite beautifully,
[00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:06.880]   which is when you're forced to live with people, you actually learn to live with people.
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:08.080]   You know who people are.
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:11.440]   There's the good guy, the bad guy, but you learn to live together.
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:17.280]   Where when you have a very itinerant sort of lifestyle like we do in city,
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:19.120]   you can up and leave whenever you want and everybody can move.
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:21.680]   And we become less tolerant of each other.
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:22.560]   And I think he's right.
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.160]   I like that.
[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:26.560]   This episode is brought to you by Element.
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:31.440]   Now, I love Element and I use it all the time because it helps anyone stay hydrated
[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:36.800]   without the sugar and other dodgy ingredients in popular electrolyte and sports drinks.
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:40.560]   And that's important because electrolyte deficiency or imbalance can cause headaches,
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:43.440]   cramps, fatigue, brain fog, and weakness.
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:48.400]   In fact, Element is a zero sugar electrolyte drink mix and sparkling electrolyte water
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:52.880]   born from the growing body of research revealing that optimal health outcomes
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:56.240]   occur at sodium levels two to three times government recommendations.
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:17:01.440]   Element is formulated for anyone on a mission to restore their health through hydration
[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:06.080]   and is perfectly suited for everyone from athletes to regular people like me
[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:10.160]   and works if you're fasting on a keto, low carb, or paleo diet.
[00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.400]   And if you're not sure if it's for you, don't worry,
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:15.520]   because Element offers a no questions asked refund policy.
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.600]   So you can try it totally risk-free.

[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:36.000]   This episode is brought to you by Fabric by Gerber Life.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.320]   If you have anyone relying on your income,
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:40.640]   then you really should be considering life insurance,
[00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:43.280]   but be careful going with the policy you get at work
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:47.280]   because it might not offer enough protection or follow you if you leave your job.
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:50.800]   Instead, get your peace of mind from a term life insurance policy.
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:53.280]   And Fabric by Gerber Life is term life insurance

[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:41.120]   Policies issued by Western Southern Life Insurance Company,
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:42.960]   not available in certain states.
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:45.760]   Prices subject to underwriting and health questions.
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:50.640]   Is there a number of close friends you think is important to invest in?
[00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:53.040]   Again, it depends on the people, right?
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:56.160]   Like some people, they have their three ride or dies
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:01.120]   from junior high school till the day they die, and that's it.
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:01.600]   Great.
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:04.400]   Some people, you know, had them and they outgrew them,
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:07.040]   and they've got a new couple of really close friends.
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:09.280]   You know, some people have a slightly larger network.
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:12.640]   I think it's more about the quality of the relationships that makes you feel
[00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:15.680]   seen, heard, and understood, that makes you feel safe,
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:18.240]   that makes you feel you've got people to turn to.
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:21.280]   Whatever the number is, that number can be one.
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:25.280]   And there's a funny thing about friendship, which I, you know, we all, I hope,
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:33.040]   as many of us as possible, have a few people that we could call in hard times, right?
[00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:39.360]   Like the shit hits the fan, and there's a couple people I'll open up to when I'm struggling, right?
[00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:41.440]   Hopefully, we have that network.
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:44.480]   And if we, I think one of the reasons that this conversation is important,
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:47.200]   I think too many don't have that network, right?
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:49.520]   I've talked to, particularly, a lot of young people.
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:51.040]   They like their friends, they have fun with their friends,
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:52.400]   but they don't really deeply trust their friends,
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:55.520]   and they would never call their friends in really hard times.
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:58.800]   That's, I think, part of the challenge, which is why we see a younger generation,
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:01.920]   in particular, struggling with stress and suffering with depression,
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:04.720]   of anxiety at higher levels, of higher numbers.
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:07.040]   But I find it really interesting is,
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:11.440]   whatever the number of people you have that you could call in hard times,
[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:15.440]   it's an even smaller number of people that you can call in really good times.
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:17.600]   The ones you can call and brag.
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:22.640]   You'd be like, "I just won this. I just did this. I just accomplished this."
[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:25.440]   And they just share in your joy without judgment or jealousy.
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:28.000]   And that number, I find so interesting that good,
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.680]   good news is an even smaller number of people you can call the bad news.
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:35.040]   I'm like thinking through my friend network, and then when you said rider dies,
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:38.080]   I think my wife has a few friends she describes in that way.
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:40.480]   It actually makes me wonder, are the types of friends,
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:44.400]   are women or men, is there a difference in how they have friendships?
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:48.240]   And I think my wife, based on how you describe it, is better at being a friend.
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:52.880]   I think women, on balance, yes, women are better.
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:58.000]   I think because they're just more comfortable being vulnerable.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:04.080]   Men struggle to say, "I love you," to other men.
[00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:07.920]   "I love you," not "love ya," not "love ya, dude."
[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:10.560]   "I love you."
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:14.000]   Really hard to say it, even if you mean it, right?
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.840]   I'll tell you a story.
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:19.760]   So a buddy of mine, he's remarkable.
[00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:21.280]   He's active duty military.
[00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:24.960]   He's a freaking national hero, warrior.
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:25.920]   He's hardcore.
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:26.960]   He's amazing, right?
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:30.080]   And over the years, we've become super close.
[00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:34.320]   And we were on the phone catching up about what doesn't matter, you know?
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:37.520]   And after about an hour, we got off the phone.
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:39.360]   And as we're about to hang up, he says, "I love you."
[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:41.680]   And I remember feeling that.
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:44.160]   "I love you," he said.
[00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:46.960]   And I said, "I love you, too."
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:47.600]   And we hung up.
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:50.800]   And I remember what it felt like.
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:53.200]   And so I decided to do an experiment.
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:54.640]   I had two friends in particular.
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:58.240]   I was over at one of their, one friend's house.
[00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:59.920]   He's an amazing guy.
[00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:02.800]   But if you met him, you wouldn't describe him as warm, right?
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:04.000]   He's a little distant.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.600]   That's how most people would describe him.
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:08.240]   And I was getting ready to leave his house.
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:08.720]   And I turned to him.
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:10.400]   I'm like, "Hey, I'll talk to you soon."
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.440]   He's like, "Yeah, yeah, I'll talk to you soon."
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:12.240]   I'm like, "I love you."
[00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:16.000]   And I watched him, you know?
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.440]   And our friendship is even closer, even closer now.
[00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:25.440]   And I have another friend who is, again, super close,
[00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:28.800]   not very emotionally available, but amazing human being.
[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:30.960]   And I remember I did the same experiment.
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:33.520]   I was like, "Hey, I love you."
[00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:34.800]   He's like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:36.560]   You know, try to like deflect, deflect.
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:37.360]   But I did it again.
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:39.440]   The next time I saw him, I was like, "I love you."
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:42.720]   And he hugged me like I was his child.
[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:45.840]   And I gave him a kiss on the cheek.
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:50.800]   And my friendships with these guys are even closer
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:54.160]   because we've taken first my one friend,
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:58.080]   but then I took the risk to express an emotion
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:00.880]   that I think a lot of men don't have the courage to express.
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.240]   Wow.
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.040]   Start there.
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:05.360]   You mentioned being a friend in hard times.
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:08.560]   I think one thing that I struggle with,
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:11.280]   I'm such a try to solve the problems
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:13.200]   that when someone's in a hard time,
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:16.240]   I know if you ask me outside, "What should I do?"
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:17.600]   I should just sit and listen.
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:19.120]   But I just struggle so hard.
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:22.000]   You acknowledged it as if this is not an uncommon thing.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.040]   Take a listening class.
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:25.040]   There's a difference between listening
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:27.120]   and waiting for your turn to speak, right?
[00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:27.760]   You want to help.
[00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:28.560]   You want to be there.
[00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:31.200]   Good instincts, but your instinct is to fix.
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:33.920]   Again, I think this is more male than female.
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:35.600]   Women are much better at holding space.
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.680]   Men want to fix in general, not as a rule.
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:39.040]   But when somebody is struggling,
[00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:42.400]   they don't have the mental capacity
[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:45.680]   to even take in the stuff you're telling them, right?
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:48.720]   All they need is to not feel alone.
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:51.840]   And the funny thing is people can take instructions.
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:54.240]   I called a friend.
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:55.760]   I was in a dark time.
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:56.800]   I was struggling.
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:58.560]   I called her up and was like, "Hey, could you have a minute?
[00:23:58.560 --> 00:23:59.360]   I just need to talk."
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:00.880]   And I started telling her how I was feeling.
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:02.800]   And she went into fix it mode.
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:06.000]   And I said to her, "I don't need you to fix anything.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:06.960]   I just need you to listen.
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:09.040]   I can give the instruction."
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:10.080]   And she goes, "Okay."
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:12.000]   And she can adjust.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.800]   And the thing about somebody who's struggling
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:16.400]   or depressed or down or whatever it is,
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:19.360]   is they can't see the obvious.
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:21.520]   That's why they're depressed or down or anxious.
[00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:24.800]   You are not depressed, down or anxious in that moment,
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:26.400]   which is why you can see the obvious.
[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:28.560]   So sometimes trying to fix it and tell them
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:29.600]   will make them feel worse.
[00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:33.280]   You're basically calling them stupid.
[00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:37.280]   And so to be a good friend, you have to be good at knowing
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:38.320]   what people need in the moment.
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:40.160]   And you don't even have to be intuitive.
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:43.760]   You can ask, "Do you want me to try and offer you a solution?
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:45.200]   Or do you want me to listen?"
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:47.120]   They'll tell you, "I need you to just listen."
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:49.360]   Just ask for instructions.
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:53.440]   And so if a friend is depressed, they're sitting in mud,
[00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:55.040]   get in the mud with them.
[00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:57.920]   Nobody wants to be in mud, the person who's depressed
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:58.960]   or the person who's helping.
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:01.120]   It's not fun to be around depressed people,
[00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:02.880]   but that's what it means to be a friend.
[00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:04.080]   It means you get in the mud.
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:05.840]   If somebody's struggling to get out of bed,
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:07.840]   don't tell them all the reasons they should get out of bed.
[00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:10.320]   Go over to their house, get in bed with them,
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:12.480]   and eat ice cream with them and watch movies all day
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:14.000]   and sit in the mud with them.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.920]   And when they are ready, they will turn to you and say,
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:17.840]   "I think I'm ready to get out now."
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:19.840]   And you're like, "Good, now let me help you.
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:22.800]   Now I'll go into fix-it mode and try and pull you out of the mud."
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:27.360]   But the most important thing is when someone is going
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:32.640]   through hard times, make sure they know they're not alone.
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:34.880]   Make them feel not alone.
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:37.920]   The fixing will happen, they will get through it,
[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:40.560]   but they will struggle to get through it if they feel alone.
[00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:42.400]   And if all you do is go into fix-it mode,
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:44.320]   you will make them feel even more alone.
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:48.320]   I feel like as you describe this, I'm going back to basics.
[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:49.280]   You talked about longevity.
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:51.200]   It's like people are trying to diet supplement this,
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:53.520]   but they're not actually just like being with people.
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:57.680]   Are there other fundamental human skills that people just are bad at
[00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:00.640]   that life would be so much better if we could improve
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:02.800]   that we aren't thinking about because they're so obvious?
[00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:08.160]   It's such a good question because the answer is all of it, right?
[00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:11.680]   Like cats don't have to work hard to be good at being a cat.
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:14.160]   They're just naturally good at being cats.
[00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:16.240]   But to be human takes work.
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:20.000]   Like without work, we all suck at being human.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.080]   We do.
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.480]   And the reason is the annoying neocortex.
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:26.320]   We're the only animal with a neocortex,
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:28.960]   this rational analytical brain that can drive us nuts
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:31.120]   and overthink and do all those things.
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:35.440]   And we think that thinking and measuring and analyzing
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:39.360]   is the solution to everything, but all it does is screw things up.
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:41.520]   And so, yeah, we have to learn to reconnect
[00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:45.120]   and leverage and manage and all those human skills.
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:46.480]   Like if somebody calls them soft skills,
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:48.000]   again, I'm going to freaking punch them.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.200]   They're human skills.
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:50.960]   Hard skills are the skills I need to do my job.
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:54.000]   And soft and human skills are the skills I need to be a better human being.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:54.880]   And I need both.
[00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:59.120]   Because hard and soft are opposites, but hard and human are not.
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:03.280]   And so the simple answer is yes, you have to work on all of it.
[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:05.200]   You have to work on listening.
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:07.200]   You have to work on empathy.
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:10.880]   You have to work on how to give trust, not just how to receive it.
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:14.320]   You have to learn how to show love.
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:15.760]   You have to learn how to receive love.
[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:20.000]   You have to learn how to have an uncomfortable conversation.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.520]   You have to learn how to give feedback.
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:23.040]   You have to learn how to receive feedback.
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:25.280]   And annoyingly, the way you like things,
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:27.040]   the way you like loving and giving love,
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:29.600]   the way you like giving feedback or receiving feedback
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:30.640]   may not work for somebody else,
[00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:32.400]   which means now you have to learn to be flexible
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:33.440]   with all the stuff you're learning.
[00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:36.240]   It's so freaking hard.
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:40.400]   And no one is ever going to be an expert human.
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:42.320]   We're all shitty at it.
[00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:44.000]   Some are slightly better than others.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.520]   But most people are pretty shitty at being humans.
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:48.720]   And here's even worse.
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:50.960]   You get a bad night's sleep, you suck at all of it.
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:53.360]   So it takes energy.
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:54.480]   Oh, come on.
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:56.320]   Yeah, being human is hard work.
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:57.840]   And the humans I like the most
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:00.400]   are the ones who wake up in the morning and say,
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:04.160]   "Today, I'm going to work to be a slightly better human."
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:06.000]   I can't work on all of it at the same time.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.440]   It's like being healthy, right?
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:08.400]   We have to exercise.
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:09.280]   We have to eat right.
[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:10.080]   You have to sleep right.
[00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:12.000]   You can't do it all well every day.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.840]   You kind of like pick a couple and those that you're not focusing on
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:17.600]   and drop and you go over there.
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:19.760]   That's life too.
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:20.800]   That's being human too.
[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:23.600]   You pick up one, you drop another, but it's also a muscle.
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:25.280]   If you practice listening, you get good at it.
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:27.040]   If you stop doing it, it will atrophy.
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:28.560]   And if you know what good listening sounds like,
[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:29.600]   have a fight with your wife.
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:31.280]   Tell me how well it goes, right?
[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:33.840]   And if you're a good listener, it's hard,
[00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:37.440]   but you'll hug each other and love each other more at the end of that fight.
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:40.960]   If you suck at it, if you suck at listening,
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:42.080]   it'll escalate and escalate.
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:43.360]   And one of you will storm out of the room.
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:45.040]   If you want to know if you're a good listener or a bad listener,
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:48.720]   just find conflict anywhere or find someone who's struggling.
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:52.480]   And at the end, ask them, how do you feel?
[00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:54.640]   Do you feel heard?
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:55.760]   And they'll tell you yes or no.
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:57.200]   You'll get a kick out of this one.
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:01.120]   I was at this meeting and I was sitting next to this woman
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:03.200]   who supposedly was some fancy yoga instructor.
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:07.440]   And the entire meeting, she was on her phone underneath the table
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:09.520]   and I could see what she was doing.
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:10.320]   I'm sitting right next to her.
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:13.200]   And it's not like she had a family member in the hospital
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:14.560]   and she was checking in or something.
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:15.520]   She was on her socials.
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:17.040]   I could see I'm just sitting next to her.
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:21.040]   And at one point, the conversation at the table
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:23.600]   while she's looking down turned to being present.
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:24.720]   We talked about being present.
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:26.560]   Her head pops up and she says,
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:28.720]   that's why I love yoga because it helps me be present.
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:31.280]   And I thought to myself, here's what she doesn't understand.
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:35.200]   Being present is not something you do in a yoga class.
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:37.600]   I think you missed the whole point of this thing, right?
[00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:40.960]   You don't know you're present until somebody else says you are.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.600]   Because being present is a deeply cooperative thing.
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:47.040]   Now you can practice being present.
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:48.800]   Yes, all the benefits of meditation.
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:50.800]   So think about what meditation is, right?
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:53.840]   If you know how to meditate, you're supposed to be still.
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:56.720]   You're supposed to focus on one thing.
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:57.760]   Could be your breath.
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:58.640]   Could be a sound.
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:29:59.760]   Could be a mantra.
[00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:00.720]   You could be look at something.
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:01.280]   It doesn't matter.
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:02.800]   You focus on one thing.
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:05.360]   And when you get distracted from that one thing,
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:07.760]   a thought pops in your head, you're supposed to label it.
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:09.200]   Push it out of your mind.
[00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:10.240]   Say, I'll deal with it later.
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:12.160]   And go back to focusing on that one thing.
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:14.240]   And at some point when it works, it just kind of clicks.
[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:16.320]   And you're like, all there.
[00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:18.800]   Now we know all the medical benefits.
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:21.040]   And much has been written, spoken already about
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:24.800]   all the magical personal benefits to meditation.
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:28.640]   We don't talk about are the social benefits to meditation, right?
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:33.680]   Which are the reason to practice meditation is for someone else.
[00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:36.480]   So when you sit down with somebody and you go, I'm struggling.
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:38.400]   You're like, I'm focusing on that.
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:41.680]   And there could be a car screeching behind you.
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:42.720]   You won't even turn around.
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:46.400]   And you have a thought of something you want to contribute to what they're saying.
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:46.880]   But you don't.
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:47.600]   You put out of your mind.
[00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:48.800]   You say, I'll deal with that lady right now.
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:50.000]   The only thing that matters is this.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.480]   And this whole meditation practice was valuable for this one moment.
[00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:57.120]   And at the end, your friend will say to you, thank you for listening.
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:58.320]   Thank you.
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:00.720]   I really appreciate you being present here.
[00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:01.840]   I feel so heard.
[00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:02.720]   Thank you.
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:03.220]   Thank you.
[00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:06.240]   Because you've been practicing and practicing and practicing
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:08.960]   that magical skill for the benefit of another.
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:11.760]   And I think that's one of the things we've completely neglected
[00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:13.440]   in our modern Western society.
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:17.120]   We've taken all these Eastern practices and we've made them selfish.
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:19.200]   Yoga is something I do for myself.
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:20.560]   Why don't you do yoga for other people?
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:22.560]   Meditation is what I do for me.
[00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:25.440]   Or you could meditate for the benefit of others.
[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:27.680]   And the benefits to you are just the lucky strike extra.
[00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:30.000]   There's an entire section in the bookshop called self-help.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   And there's no section in the bookshop called help others.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.320]   And I think if you look at why we're depressed and why we're
[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:39.280]   anxious and why we're stressed, it's because we feel alone.
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:42.240]   And all of the incentive structures around us and our parents
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:45.280]   and our guidance counselors are constantly telling us to focus on us.
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:50.000]   Your career, your happiness, your marriage, your partner, your money.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.120]   You're this, you're that.
[00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:52.720]   Me, me, me, me, me, me, me.
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:54.000]   We're all obsessed with me.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:59.520]   And yet to be a happy, successful, thriving, long-living human being.
[00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:01.200]   It's us.
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:02.000]   It's we.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.120]   Every time, every day.
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:06.880]   And we forget that we are legacy machines.
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:09.920]   The human animal is tens of thousands of years old.
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:14.160]   And this technology hasn't changed in tens of thousands of years at all.
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:16.640]   It's a legacy machine in a modern world.
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:22.480]   And the modern world has hijacked a lot of our internal systems to our own detriment.
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:23.840]   There's nothing wrong with dopamine.
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:26.640]   Dopamine exists for very good biological reasons.
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:36.720]   Now, the way that gaming companies and search firms and YouTubes and Instagrams and TikToks
[00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:40.880]   have hijacked that reward structure for their benefit, not ours.
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:41.440]   Not good.
[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:42.800]   Very unhealthy.
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:44.080]   Detrimental.
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:47.840]   And all of these systems can be hijacked and faked.
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:49.440]   Right?
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:52.960]   And we can feel like we have these warm, loving relationships that aren't really there.
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:57.200]   And so I think to do the hard work of going back to basics of the legacy machine and understanding
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:00.640]   why the machine was built the way it was, and it was that we have to cooperate and look
[00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:02.400]   after each other for our very survival.
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:06.000]   You put a human being by themselves in the woods, they die.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:06.560]   They die.
[00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:08.160]   That's what happens.
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:08.640]   They die.
[00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:11.280]   Most of the time.
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:14.400]   You put a group of people in the woods by themselves, they'll do okay.
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:15.600]   We are cooperative animals.
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:19.680]   Our very survival depends on how much we love and trust each other.
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:23.200]   Because if I trust you, I'll go to sleep at night and know that you watched it for danger
[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:23.600]   for me.
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:24.880]   And I know you'd do the same for me.
[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:25.760]   I don't trust you.
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:26.720]   I can't sleep at night.
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:28.000]   Can't sleep.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.240]   And these are basic things.
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:34.080]   And I think we've over, we've over indexed.
[00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:40.960]   I'm trying to measure everything and modernize everything and systematize everything and
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:43.440]   spreadsheet everything and app everything.
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:46.560]   There's no app for love.
[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:49.360]   There's no app for friendship.
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:50.880]   There's no app to help you listen.
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:52.640]   Hold on, honey.
[00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:54.560]   Let me get my app out while we're having this fight.
[00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:57.600]   Can you imagine holding up like a Google Translate while you're fighting with your
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:58.400]   wife?
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:33:59.520]   That's not going to go well.
[00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:01.280]   Right?
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:03.200]   This is just old fashioned shit.
[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:05.840]   And when I say old fashioned, I mean, like, really old fashioned.
[00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:08.720]   Well, you said human skills.
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:12.960]   My brain immediately goes to think like, oh, I need to learn how to do things.
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:15.120]   And then I'm trying to remember all the things you said.
[00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:19.280]   It was like listening, confrontation, conversation, feedback, empathy.
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:21.200]   All of them involve other people.
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:25.680]   So they're human skills, but they're multi-human skills.
[00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:29.440]   Like you need other people to practice them and use them.
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:30.960]   And those seem to be what we've lost.
[00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:33.360]   It's not the skill of sharpening a knife.
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:33.680]   Correct.
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:38.000]   They're pro-social behaviors where a lot of the things we are really good at practicing,
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.480]   I would argue, are at worst anti-social behaviors or at minimum unsocial behavior.
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:43.840]   Right?
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:48.400]   High performing individuals that are addicted to dopamine do really well.
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:52.000]   Not a lot of level of trust around them.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.200]   You know?
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:55.200]   What's the school for human skills?
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:57.280]   The good news is there's bunches of stuff to do.
[00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:59.600]   I mean, like, I try and put stuff out in the world to help.
[00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:01.600]   There's no one size fits all.
[00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:03.920]   If you want to learn listening, go read a book called How to Talk to Kids
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:05.680]   So Kids Will Listen to Listen So Kids Will Talk.
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:06.800]   It's a parenting book.
[00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:07.280]   Right?
[00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:09.040]   Turns out adults are like children.
[00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:12.080]   So, for example, one of the things you'll learn in this book is when your kids have
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:14.640]   feelings, you don't deny them the feelings, you affirm their feelings.
[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:18.480]   So when your kid is angry at something stupid, right?
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:21.680]   Or upset at something ridiculous, you don't have to be angry over that.
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:22.640]   That's ridiculous.
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:24.240]   You would never say that to a child.
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:30.400]   You say things like, "Wow, yeah, if that happened to me, I'd be angry too."
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:31.520]   You affirm their feelings.
[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:34.400]   And then they feel good and they feel seen and they feel heard.
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:34.800]   You know this.
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:35.520]   You're a parent.
[00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:38.160]   Yeah, I'm like, "This sounds like a conversation I had yesterday."
[00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:39.520]   Yeah, you've learned this.
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:40.640]   Not do that with an adult.
[00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:44.880]   Your friend's upset, don't be like, "Dude, what are you talking about?
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:46.560]   Your life's freaking amazing.
[00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:47.040]   Shut up."
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:52.640]   Go like, "Dude, yeah, if I was in your shoes, I'd feel the same way."
[00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:55.120]   Affirm the feelings.
[00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:55.760]   Same thing.
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:56.640]   You don't have to agree with it.
[00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:57.280]   You don't have to like it.
[00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:58.000]   Just affirm it.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.640]   What is it about our brains that make it so easy to do that?
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:04.800]   Like with my children, that's exactly what happens.
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:07.280]   But by default, that's not what happens with other people.
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:08.160]   Is it practice?
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:09.200]   I think kids are vulnerable.
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:16.160]   And we really work hard to take care of kids so that they can grow up to be the best, most
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:17.440]   confident version of themselves.
[00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:20.560]   Now, imagine if we applied that same mentality to our friends.
[00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:22.320]   They're vulnerable.
[00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:27.200]   And I'm going to do everything I can so that they will grow up to be the best, most confident
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:28.080]   version of themselves.
[00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:37.680]   I mean, if I had a friend that said, "My job to be Simon's friend is to see him as a vulnerable
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:42.080]   human, offer him all the care and protection as he try and muddles through life.
[00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:44.960]   And I want to help him build his confidence so he can be the best version of himself."
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:47.600]   I'm going to turn to that person and be like, "Be my friend forever.
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:48.480]   Please, please, please."
[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:52.960]   We treat friends as the lowest rung on the hierarchy, right?
[00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:56.080]   Like, would you cancel on a meeting for a friend?
[00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:58.240]   Would you cancel on a friend for a meeting?
[00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:00.080]   "Oh, but my friends will understand."
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:00.560]   Okay.
[00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:01.120]   Just saying.
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:02.080]   Low on the hierarchy.
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:06.080]   If you have struggles in your marriage, what do you do?
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:12.640]   You suffer, you go through it, you talk to friends, maybe get some therapy together,
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:14.160]   get some couples therapy.
[00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:17.440]   You work really hard to try and make it work.
[00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:22.480]   And divorce is going to be the last resort, not the first choice, but we're going to try.
[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:27.440]   And it's been shit for the past six months, but we're in it.
[00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:30.000]   You have issues with a friend.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.760]   Maybe there's a violation of trust.
[00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:32.640]   What do you do?
[00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:35.520]   You'd be like, "Listen, I don't know if I can be in this friendship anymore.
[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:37.040]   What you did, unacceptable."
[00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:38.800]   Really?
[00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:41.440]   You'll go for therapy with your wife, but you won't go for therapy with your friend
[00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:42.640]   that you've known longer than your wife?
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:45.440]   One violation of trust?
[00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:46.960]   Spouses violate trust all the time.
[00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:47.760]   It's not easy.
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:49.600]   It sucks.
[00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:53.200]   And so I think the ability to wrestle with discomfort.
[00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:57.280]   But with friends, we treat them like, "I can't be friends with you anymore."
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:01.280]   Like we're indignant when they screw up.
[00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:02.480]   God forbid we screw up.
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:05.200]   So yeah, I think we put a pretty low standard on friendship.
[00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:06.720]   We put much higher standards on work.
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:09.280]   We put much higher standards on our romantic relationships.
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:11.920]   But we tend to undervalue friendships when we don't work as hard on them.
[00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:12.960]   To our own detriment.
[00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:16.960]   Because when work fucks you and your wife says, "I want a divorce,"
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:18.640]   it's only friends you got left.
[00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:22.320]   You mentioned when you mess it up, what can we do better as humans
[00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:25.840]   when we acknowledge or realize our own faults?
[00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:26.880]   Say them out loud.
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:27.680]   It's accountability.
[00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:29.680]   Like at work, we talk about accountability, right?
[00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:32.960]   The best bosses are the ones who say, "I screwed up, on me, on me."
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.160]   The best bosses are the ones who demand accountability.
[00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:39.440]   "Hey, boss, this failed because it was on me.
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:42.320]   It wasn't market conditions, it was me.
[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:45.280]   And if it was market conditions, I should have been better at tracking market conditions
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:48.560]   and be prepared for them if they went sideways and had no backup plan on me."
[00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:52.160]   And we go, "Okay, I gotcha.
[00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:52.720]   What do you need?"
[00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:54.320]   We can be frustrated.
[00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:54.880]   We can be upset.
[00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:58.640]   But as long as there's no negligence, we're like, "All right, this sucks.
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:38:59.760]   I'm here to help you."
[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:00.960]   We do that all the time.
[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:02.320]   So why not do that in friendship as well?
[00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:03.040]   Accountability.
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:07.600]   "I totally, I totally, that's on me.
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:08.160]   Oh, my God.
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:10.480]   I should do better.
[00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:11.200]   I know better.
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:13.200]   I am deeply sorry.
[00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:14.720]   Here's what I'm doing to fix it."
[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:15.680]   What do you expect at work?
[00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:20.320]   "Hey, boss, I missed the deadline on me.
[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:22.400]   Here's what I'm implementing so it doesn't happen again."
[00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:25.360]   Again, we work really hard to get it right at work.
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:27.280]   It's the same skills.
[00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:31.600]   "Honey, this is, or friend, this is what I'm going to do.
[00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:33.840]   This is where I need your help."
[00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:36.640]   So I ask for help, right?
[00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:43.440]   So for example, I said, "Listen, super absent-minded, super forgetful.
[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:47.840]   Sometimes I'll say something, I'll even make a plan with you, and you won't hear from me,
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:49.840]   and you take it so personally because you think I've forgotten.
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:50.560]   I have forgotten.
[00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:54.160]   Please just ask me, and I'll tell you.
[00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:55.680]   I just need your help on this one."
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:59.920]   So I think it's all about communication.
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:01.200]   And it's just like at work.
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:02.800]   We know all these things at work.
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:05.680]   This is why it's not such a stretch for me from writing leadership books to writing a
[00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:07.520]   friendship book, right?
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:08.640]   Communication is lubrication.
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:10.720]   When there's a lot of communication at work, things run smoothly.
[00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:13.040]   When there's less communication, there's a lot of friction.
[00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:14.160]   It's the same in friendships.
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:18.160]   This episode is brought to you by Viore, which is amazing because they are one of only the
[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:20.720]   few brands I wear almost every single day.
[00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:21.680]   I've got a shirt on.
[00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:23.360]   I've got the course shorts on.
[00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:27.760]   I love Viore, and I love that they bring a new perspective on performance apparel.
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:31.760]   It's so versatile, it can be used for just about any activity, whether it's running,
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:36.720]   training, swimming, yoga, or even lounging, or running errands, or going out to dinner.
[00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:40.080]   Seriously, I wear my MetaPants out for dinner all the time.
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:43.760]   But today I want to talk about their Dreamknit collection because it's amazing.
[00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:49.280]   It is super soft, lightweight, moisture-wicking, but also has this amazing four-way performance
[00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:51.520]   stretch that makes it so comfortable.
[00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:55.440]   While it's almost impossible to narrow my Viore recommendations down to just one thing,
[00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:59.440]   I want you to check out the Ponto Performance Jogger for men or the Performance Jogger for
[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:00.000]   women.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.080]   I know me and my wife, Amy, absolutely love them and wear them all the time.
[00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:08.080]   Seriously, I think Viore is an investment in your happiness, and for everyone watching,

[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:41.040]   Now, when it comes to building wealth, taxes are such a big part of the strategy.
[00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:45.520]   And as tax time gets closer, getting prepared now is so important.
[00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:49.520]   And now that I'm working with Gelt, I finally feel like I have a partner I can trust to
[00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:52.800]   handle everything for my personal and business taxes.

[00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:22.560]   or QBI, and much more.

[00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:36.080]   Just head to chrishutchins.com/gelt, G-E-L-T.
[00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:41.760]   Again, that's chrishutchins.com/gelt or find the link in the description to stop overpaying
[00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:42.640]   on taxes.
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:46.240]   What seems like at work, we have these metrics of like, I get a promotion, I have a salary,
[00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:47.040]   I have an increase.
[00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:52.080]   So we want to learn all these skills to achieve this outcome of some level of growth.
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:55.040]   And in friendship, there's no real like, oh, I have deeper friendships.
[00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:56.000]   I've leveled up.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   So people kind of forget about it.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:03.200]   But when I think about my grandparents and I think, oh, wow, the last 40 years of their
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:07.840]   life was made better by them being great at being friends, right?
[00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:10.400]   Like building friends, being there for people.
[00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:16.160]   It seems so obvious that we should focus on this, but it doesn't feel like it's been culturally
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:16.960]   obvious.
[00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:22.000]   I try and talk about these things in the here and now because it's such a trope to say that
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:27.840]   nobody is on their deathbed and wishes they worked harder and spent more time at work.
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:30.400]   People always wish they spent more time with their family and friends.
[00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:34.160]   Like, it's such a joke, you know?
[00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:40.000]   But it's like, nobody thinks the house is going to burn down when they buy insurance.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.160]   Like, we're terrible long-term planners.
[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:44.320]   People are terrible at saving money, right?
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:47.520]   Because nobody thinks they're going to need it until it's too late.
[00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:50.080]   We have to talk to people in the here and now, right?
[00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:51.040]   Let's get them where they are.
[00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:53.920]   Are you the happiest you can be?
[00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:56.000]   Do you feel like you've got someone who's got your back?
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:00.560]   Do you feel like you can call someone when you're not doing well and that they have the
[00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:02.560]   skill set to know how to hold space?
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:08.880]   Do you ever have people to call to brag about how freaking amazing you are and they share
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:11.600]   in the joy with you and big up you and make you feel even better?
[00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:14.560]   Or do you have to keep it to yourself because you're kind of embarrassed that you're going
[00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:16.640]   to be that guy to your friends?
[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:21.600]   Just ask yourself these questions if you have any of these people in your life.
[00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:27.520]   If the answer is no to any of them, then maybe a little work is required.
[00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:28.160]   That's okay.
[00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:32.240]   One of the biggest questions I get is, "I don't know how to make friends."
[00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:33.440]   I hear it from young people.
[00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:34.640]   I hear it from older people.
[00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:37.680]   They lean into me and they go, "I don't know how to make friends.
[00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:39.680]   I don't know what I'm doing."
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:44.320]   This is part of the downside of the internet and television and all this stuff.
[00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:46.960]   There used to be bowling leagues.
[00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:48.560]   There's an old book written about it called Bowling Alone.
[00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:50.000]   There's no bowling leagues anymore.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:55.760]   There's no place we go to on Thursday nights to hang out with people who have the same
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:58.720]   interests as us where we're more likely to make friends.
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:01.760]   The closest we can get is online gaming.
[00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:04.560]   You know that when you buy a video game, you get one controller.
[00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:07.600]   It doesn't even say, "Would you like to play with a friend?"
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:15.200]   In fact, most of the games you buy, it is impossible if you had two controllers to play
[00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:17.040]   the game with your friends sitting next to them.
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:19.040]   The only way to play is online.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.120]   It is impossible to sit next to your friend and play a game.
[00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:26.720]   There's precious few numbers of games that allow it.
[00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:29.920]   All of the systems are telling us, "Stay away.
[00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:30.800]   Stay away."
[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:34.240]   One of the most important things you can do as a parent, how old are your kids?
[00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:35.360]   Two and four.
[00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:39.360]   Okay, so they're a little young, but not the four-year-olds getting up there, right?
[00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:41.280]   Teach them how to be friends.
[00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:48.640]   They're young right now, but once they start hitting those teenage years, when they start
[00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:52.560]   prioritizing, they start caring more about what their friends think than what they think,
[00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:55.920]   even when they start having play dates at 8, 9, 10, 11, right?
[00:45:55.920 --> 00:46:00.160]   Kids come over, take all the phones away, call the parents.
[00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:03.440]   I mean, you made the play date and you say, "Hey, listen, you're bringing your kid over
[00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:04.240]   at four o'clock on Thursday.
[00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:06.560]   Just so you know, I'm going to take all the kids' phones away.
[00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:08.720]   If you need anything, just call me.
[00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:10.560]   I'll get your kid.
[00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:12.080]   They're going to be at the house anyway."
[00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:13.440]   Teach the kids how to make friends.
[00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:15.840]   Teach the kids how to resolve conflict.
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:19.040]   Teach the kids how to say what they need to their friends emotionally.
[00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:21.920]   Teach them how to make friends.
[00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:24.640]   Do not take it for granted.
[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:27.520]   It should be a basic human skill.
[00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:30.880]   And if we were living tens of thousands of years ago, it probably would be.
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:37.120]   But all of the distractions and dopamine and devices, it interrupts this machine.
[00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:39.040]   And so we don't know how to make friends.
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:40.400]   We've forgotten the skill.
[00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:43.920]   We have to teach our children how to make friends.
[00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:47.680]   And so a lot of these human skills are great at helping build a friendship.
[00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:50.960]   Any advice for that little middle gap there?
[00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:52.800]   You said there's no bowling leagues, right?
[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:56.320]   Even if I had all the human skills in the world, if there's not a person to be friends with,
[00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:56.960]   that's tough.
[00:46:56.960 --> 00:47:00.080]   Is there a modern version of that?
[00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:02.000]   So if someone listening is like, "I don't have a lot of friends.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.160]   Where should they go to use these skills?"
[00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:07.600]   So the best thing you can do is an act of service.
[00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:12.400]   And what I mean by that is help somebody who's struggling with the same thing as you, right?
[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:16.960]   So when I wrote "Leaders Eat Last," I went and looked at Alcoholics Anonymous.
[00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:18.880]   Amazing organization, right?
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:23.120]   Alcoholics Anonymous has a 12-step program to help you beat your addiction.
[00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:27.040]   Most people will know the first step, admit you have a problem.
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:28.880]   "I don't have any friends.
[00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:29.760]   I don't know how to make friends."
[00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:30.960]   Okay, that's step one.
[00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:34.720]   But the magical thing about Alcoholics Anonymous and all of those 12-step programs is they
[00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:35.520]   know this.
[00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:39.280]   They have the data, which is if you master 11 steps but not the 12th, you're probably
[00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:40.800]   going to succumb to the disease.
[00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:43.200]   But if you master the 12th step, you're more likely to beat it.
[00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:44.400]   What's the 12th step?
[00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:46.720]   The 12th step is to help another alcoholic.
[00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:47.920]   Service.
[00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:50.160]   So don't worry about you.
[00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:50.560]   "I got it.
[00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:51.440]   You're struggling to make friends.
[00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:52.160]   You don't know how to make friends.
[00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:52.640]   I got it."
[00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:56.880]   Find somebody you know who's also struggling to make friends and wishes they could make
[00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:59.040]   friends and help them.
[00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:02.160]   And the act of service of helping them solve the problem that you're struggling with will
[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:02.960]   solve your problem.
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:07.280]   And I've seen people starting to do these things.
[00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:11.040]   For example, they'll have a salon, old school salon, right?
[00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:13.200]   Going to have 10 people over for dinner.
[00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:16.080]   I only know two or three or four.
[00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:21.360]   And I'm going to ask them to invite someone who they think would enjoy the topic we're
[00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:22.000]   going to discuss.
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.240]   And sometimes it can be silly.
[00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:26.160]   And sometimes it can be intense.
[00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:28.640]   And you host a salon.
[00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:32.720]   And maybe you have a salon group where you each take turns.
[00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:34.880]   And everybody brings somebody new each time.
[00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:35.840]   So there's the core group.
[00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:36.800]   And maybe the group grows.
[00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:38.240]   Whatever, you can figure it out.
[00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:39.520]   Have a movie night.
[00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:40.320]   Dinner parties.
[00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:43.280]   All of these things are relatively simple.
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:45.840]   Pizza night, relatively inexpensive.
[00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:49.840]   You can make them as simple or as complicated as you want.
[00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:50.880]   But find a reason.
[00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:53.840]   And invite the people who...
[00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:55.200]   And be very clear.
[00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:56.320]   Be very clear why you're doing it.
[00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:59.120]   Like, "Look, I think we need to do better at making friends.
[00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:01.040]   I think we're not good at it.
[00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:05.840]   And so I'm going to start doing these things with the hope that we can meet new people.
[00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:08.800]   But more important, we can actually be better at doing it."
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:10.240]   And by the way, same with the kids.
[00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:14.400]   The rule is, phones go in the bowl by the front door.
[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:16.720]   I do this little thing all the time.
[00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:17.680]   I'm going to show you, right?
[00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:22.480]   So here I am sitting with you on a podcast, right?
[00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:24.880]   And what if I was just like holding my phone?
[00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:25.680]   Not using it.
[00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:26.400]   Not answering it.
[00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:27.040]   Not texting.
[00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:28.480]   Nothing's buzzing.
[00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:29.440]   How does this make you feel?
[00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:31.200]   Not so great, right?
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:33.120]   And this is a totally artificial construction.
[00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:34.640]   And this is what happens.
[00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:36.640]   We go out with our friends and we hold our phones.
[00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:37.680]   Or we put it on the table.
[00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:39.760]   "Oh, let me be polite.
[00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:41.040]   Let me turn it upside down."
[00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:42.400]   Turning it upside down is not more polite.
[00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:43.120]   Because here's what happens.
[00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:44.480]   Here's what you do when you're out for dinner.
[00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:45.440]   Your phone's upside down.
[00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:46.160]   You go like this.
[00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:47.440]   Remember we talked about being present?
[00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:53.040]   That little thought that said, "Hmm, I wonder what's going on in the world.
[00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:55.680]   I wonder if there's other friends who are texting me.
[00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:58.960]   I wonder if something else is happening other than this conversation."
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:49:59.680]   Well, you know what I do?
[00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:01.200]   I put it in airplane mode.
[00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:02.720]   Because then I know nothing's coming in.
[00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:05.200]   So I'm not curious because I know nothing's coming in.
[00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:09.840]   And I put it away, out of sight, on a table, in a bag, in a jacket pocket, whatever.
[00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:10.880]   I get it away.
[00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:13.040]   Or I hand it to my friends and say, "Can you put this in your bag, please?"
[00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:15.920]   And if a friend puts their phone on the table,
[00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:17.680]   I'll be like, "Can you take your phone off the table, please?"
[00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:18.800]   Nobody's ever pushed back at me.
[00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:19.360]   They'll be like, "No!"
[00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:22.640]   Now, occasionally it's gonna be like, "Look, I'm waiting for a call."
[00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:23.040]   That's fine.
[00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:23.840]   There's always exceptions.
[00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:24.640]   No problem.
[00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:25.360]   Me too, sometimes.
[00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:26.480]   I'm like, "Hey, look, I'm really sorry.
[00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:27.280]   Just this one thing.
[00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:28.160]   But then I'll put it away."
[00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:28.800]   You know?
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:29.520]   That's okay.
[00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:31.440]   But I'll tell friends, "Hey, put it away.
[00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:32.240]   Let's be present."
[00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:35.680]   I feel like we started this conversation talking about your purpose
[00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:37.120]   and the thing that gets you out of bed.
[00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:42.560]   And I'm wondering if the energy you get from knowing that,
[00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:44.480]   which makes it even easier to get out of bed,
[00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:45.920]   does that help with all of this?
[00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:50.000]   How much of a prerequisite to try to improve your friendship,
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:51.920]   improve your life, improve your skills,
[00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:57.040]   is better if you know what your being is and what your purpose is?
[00:50:57.040 --> 00:50:57.680]   Great question.
[00:50:57.840 --> 00:51:01.280]   Um, I would venture to say yes.
[00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:04.160]   Because fundamentally, all purposes are acts of service.
[00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:05.120]   Right?
[00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:08.640]   Nobody has a purpose to be the richest person in the world.
[00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:10.320]   Like, that's not a purpose.
[00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:14.000]   And nobody's gonna go out of their way to help you achieve that.
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:14.500]   Right?
[00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:18.640]   A purpose, like we talked about with your friends,
[00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:20.560]   it's the thing you fill in others.
[00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:22.480]   And it's the way that you get fulfillment.
[00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:24.400]   So I like to give inspiration.
[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:25.760]   I love to feel inspired.
[00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:26.080]   Right?
[00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:28.240]   The thing I give to the world is the thing I need the most.
[00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:31.440]   So yeah, I think that if you have a clear sense of purpose,
[00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:33.120]   it gives you a reason to get out of bed and be like,
[00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:34.960]   this is what I want to give to people.
[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:36.960]   Whether they're my friends or whether they're strangers.
[00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:38.880]   I can do it for strangers through my work.
[00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:42.560]   I can do it for my friends through my acts of friendship.
[00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:44.480]   So yeah, I think having a clear sense of purpose
[00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:47.760]   absolutely amplifies that and gives you some clarity.
[00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:48.320]   Yes.
[00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:51.440]   And what can we do for anyone who's a parent
[00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:55.440]   in helping shape our children to, in any way?
[00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:57.360]   Or is that just a fool's errand?
[00:51:57.360 --> 00:51:58.640]   So there's data on this.
[00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:04.320]   Which is, you know, you have two kids,
[00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:06.000]   you raise them pretty much the same.
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:07.280]   They grow up really differently.
[00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:08.880]   And so what we've learned is like,
[00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:11.200]   as much as parents may try,
[00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:15.360]   your kids don't get all their values strictly from their parents.
[00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:18.160]   They get them from other places too.
[00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:18.800]   Right?
[00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:20.240]   But universally around the world,
[00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:24.000]   there's only two things that every single child
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:25.920]   learns exclusively from their parents.
[00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:29.760]   How to treat themselves and how to treat others.
[00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:33.680]   So teach them to love themselves
[00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:35.440]   and teach them to love others.
[00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:39.040]   Teach them to be there for their friends.
[00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:40.640]   Teach them to be there for their teachers.
[00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:43.360]   Teach them to be there for their bosses and their colleagues.
[00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:47.040]   And teach them to be there for each other if you have siblings.
[00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:48.800]   And teach them to look after themselves.
[00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:51.200]   You get those things right, the kids will be fine.
[00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:53.520]   And what about people who have these conversations with their friends
[00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:55.360]   and can't figure it out and they're still struggling?
[00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:57.840]   Go find the thing that resonates with you and do that.
[00:52:57.840 --> 00:53:00.320]   Like, you know, we're all a little different.
[00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:02.640]   I treat it like anything, which is if you want anything,
[00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:03.440]   you got to focus on it.
[00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:04.880]   You got to do the work, right?
[00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:05.600]   You want to get in shape?
[00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:07.200]   You got to work out every day.
[00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:08.080]   You want to eat healthy?
[00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:11.200]   You got to like eat broccoli and reduce the amount of sugar, right?
[00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:13.200]   Like, it's not like any of this stuff is difficult.
[00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:14.800]   Everybody knows everything you have to do.
[00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:15.520]   We just don't do it.
[00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:18.560]   And so friendships on the list.
[00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:19.440]   You said it yourself.
[00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:21.600]   You know, I want to fix them.
[00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:23.040]   But I know sometimes I have to listen.
[00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:24.160]   How did you know that?
[00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:25.600]   Probably because somebody yelled at you once.
[00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:26.720]   Can't you just damn listen?
[00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:27.440]   Stop fixing me.
[00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:29.760]   I mean, you know, because somebody told you.
[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:30.800]   Or multiple people, yeah.
[00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:32.240]   Or multiple people, maybe everybody.
[00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:34.720]   Or the same person multiple times.
[00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:36.480]   Or the same person every time, exactly.
[00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:41.280]   Yes, that's one where I didn't want to go down the path of,
[00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:42.880]   oh, for each of these human skills,
[00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:44.720]   let's walk through the lessons on how to do them.
[00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:47.280]   There's probably a video you've made or a post you've made
[00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:48.400]   or an episode you've done.
[00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:49.680]   But there's one that I'll come back to,
[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:52.720]   which is I feel like the constant criticism I get from my wife
[00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:56.000]   is like, I feel like you just don't have any EQ.
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.560]   Or when someone says that, I hear empathy.
[00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:00.720]   So I feel like that's a blind spot for me.
[00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:03.040]   Is there something I should be doing to get better
[00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:04.960]   other than just practicing listening?
[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:07.760]   Yes, I mean, so first of all, if she keeps saying it
[00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:10.880]   and you are now aware of it,
[00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:12.320]   now you can't say it's a blind spot.
[00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:13.840]   Now you have to say, it's something I know,
[00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:15.440]   but I've chosen not to work on
[00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:16.880]   because that's actually more accurate.
[00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:21.360]   So your wife has higher EQ, it sounds like, than you do?
[00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:23.600]   Yeah, she's going to laugh when she hears this.
[00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:26.000]   Why don't you start by asking her, I want to do this.
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:28.560]   I need to do this for myself.
[00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:29.840]   I need to do this for you.
[00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:30.960]   I don't know where to start.
[00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:33.360]   How do you have empathy?
[00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:35.200]   How do you do it?
[00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:36.400]   Show me, teach me, guide me.
[00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:39.200]   Because I want to do it and I'll be totally honest with you,
[00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:40.960]   I'm stuck, I do not know.
[00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:43.760]   And she'll say, easy, here's how you can start.
[00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:45.280]   I guarantee she's got a good answer.
[00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:48.240]   And maybe she'll say, you're a shit listener.
[00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:50.480]   Okay, you can take a listening class.
[00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:52.480]   So like, if that's what she says, then go do that.
[00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:53.360]   That's a great question.
[00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:54.400]   There aren't enough.
[00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:55.840]   I only know it because I took one.
[00:54:55.840 --> 00:54:58.640]   I've taught them loosely before, but I really should make one.
[00:54:58.640 --> 00:54:59.360]   That's a good idea.
[00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:00.320]   You could also read a book about it.
[00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:01.840]   Like I said, read the book, the kid's book,
[00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:03.920]   How to Talk to Kids So Kids Will Listen to Listeners So Kids Will Talk.
[00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:05.920]   It's a bright yellow book, you can buy it on Amazon for like a dollar.
[00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:09.440]   I sold more of that book probably than anyone else.
[00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:11.760]   But like, it's a silly little book.
[00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:12.240]   It's easy to read.
[00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:13.280]   It's got a bunch of pictures, right?
[00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:16.320]   Like, start there.
[00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:18.080]   It's something that's really basic.
[00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:21.600]   So empathy is about grace.
[00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:24.400]   So here's a couple little tricks for empathy, right?
[00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:26.080]   Because we're judgmental.
[00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:26.880]   That's what we are.
[00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:28.560]   Well, most of us, right?
[00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:31.840]   Even the ones who aren't judgy are a little bit judgy, right?
[00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:33.040]   So here's what happens.
[00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:36.320]   Let's take a work scenario just to make it easy, right?
[00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:39.040]   This is very common, right?
[00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:43.360]   Sitting in a meeting, somebody's name comes up and somebody goes, oh, they're so lazy.
[00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:51.440]   Okay, now we have passed judgment and everybody's impression of them is now tainted by one person's
[00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:52.640]   judgment or opinion of them.
[00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:56.480]   Oh, death of the party, right?
[00:55:56.480 --> 00:55:58.960]   So what you have to do is interrupt that.
[00:55:58.960 --> 00:56:03.040]   Just requires one person to say, hold on, I'd like to interject.
[00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:04.720]   They may be lazy.
[00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:05.840]   It's true.
[00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:08.480]   Or they're tired.
[00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:10.480]   Or we have them in the wrong job.
[00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:13.040]   Or they've got a huge amount of stress going on.
[00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:14.800]   At home that we don't know about.
[00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:18.400]   Or they don't know, or they've got a bad boss.
[00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:19.840]   They've been given bad direction.
[00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:21.920]   You just go down the list of all the things that could be.
[00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:22.880]   Lazy's on the list.
[00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:28.160]   But the minute you realize that there's a bunch of things on the list, it gives grace.
[00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:29.680]   That's empathy.
[00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:31.280]   Okay?
[00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:33.120]   For example, he's an asshole.
[00:56:33.120 --> 00:56:36.080]   Or he's struggling.
[00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:37.680]   Or he's stuck.
[00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:39.200]   Or he's unsure.
[00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:40.880]   He might be an asshole.
[00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:41.600]   That might be the reason.
[00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:42.400]   Yeah.
[00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:43.600]   And it just gives grace.
[00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:44.960]   That's empathy.
[00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:49.600]   So when somebody's struggling at work, we say, hey, listen, your numbers are down for
[00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:50.640]   the third quarter in a row.
[00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:52.880]   We've had this conversation before.
[00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:55.200]   If you don't pick up your numbers in the fourth quarter, I don't know what's going to happen.
[00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:57.280]   Fairly normal scenario.
[00:56:57.280 --> 00:56:59.520]   Now let's replay that with empathy.
[00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:01.760]   Hey, your numbers are down for the third quarter in a row.
[00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:04.080]   We've had this conversation before.
[00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:06.720]   What's going on?
[00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:07.520]   I'm worried about you.
[00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:09.600]   That's empathy.
[00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:11.040]   It's not assuming.
[00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:12.400]   It's giving grace.
[00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:14.960]   It's assuming that there's something that we don't know about.
[00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:15.840]   That's all it is.
[00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:16.640]   Right?
[00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:18.800]   You know, we talk about putting yourself in somebody else's shoes.
[00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:19.680]   It's hard to do.
[00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:21.840]   I think that's true, but it oversimplifies it.
[00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:27.840]   And I think the easiest way to have empathy is just have grace, assume good, and add to
[00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:29.120]   that list of possibilities.
[00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:32.160]   And that's a good way to practice it.
[00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:32.800]   Super helpful.
[00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:34.320]   I'm going to ask my wife this question tonight.
[00:57:34.320 --> 00:57:35.120]   We'll see how it goes.
[00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:35.760]   It'll go well.
[00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:36.320]   You know why?
[00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:40.640]   Because if you're serious about wanting to take yourself on, and if you're serious about
[00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:42.960]   asking for advice to do it, it will go well.
[00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:46.400]   It's funny because as you describe empathy, I wonder if there's actually something my
[00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:48.720]   wife describes that I'm missing that's not that.
[00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:52.160]   Because in the workplace, in a lot of places, I kind of have that, I'm going to call it
[00:57:52.160 --> 00:57:54.880]   optimism because I know you like that word, but it's like, oh, well, maybe this other
[00:57:54.880 --> 00:57:56.320]   thing could be at play.
[00:57:56.320 --> 00:58:01.280]   Like seeing that someone that's not doing well or struggling or missing the boat could
[00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:05.200]   have another reason behind that, I feel like I'm actually pretty good at.
[00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:08.880]   But there's something that I'm obviously not good at because it gets brought up a lot.
[00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:13.040]   No, but I think you're also making the point, which is like, would you prioritize a meeting
[00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:15.040]   over a friend or prioritize a friend over a meeting?
[00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:19.920]   Anybody who cares about their leadership skills works on this stuff at work because they want
[00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:20.800]   work to go better.
[00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:24.640]   And we work on these human things because we know what teamwork is, and we know what
[00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:26.160]   camaraderie is and morale.
[00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:30.560]   We know all of these things, and we work hard to be good leaders so that we can boost morale
[00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:34.800]   in order to increase engagement, productivity, and innovation, blah, blah, blah.
[00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:35.840]   Like we do it.
[00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:38.320]   And then we turn it off and we come home.
[00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:43.680]   For years, girls I dated, friends, they'd say to me, "Simon, you are the worst listener."
[00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:44.880]   This was honestly my response.
[00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:47.680]   I'd be like, "Do you know what I do for a living?
[00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:50.000]   Like, what do you mean?
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:52.800]   I'm a phenomenal listener.
[00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:55.040]   Are you kidding me?"
[00:58:55.040 --> 00:58:56.400]   That would be my honest answer.
[00:58:56.400 --> 00:59:00.560]   Then I took the listening class, and I called up all of those friends one by one.
[00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:05.360]   I'd be like, "Hey, I just took a class, and I'm a shit listener."
[00:59:06.320 --> 00:59:08.240]   And they're like, "Newsflash."
[00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:15.040]   And I said, "I learned that I am a fantastic listener with people I will never see again
[00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:15.920]   for the rest of my life.
[00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:20.240]   But people who I love to read my life on a daily basis, terrible.
[00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:22.480]   So you might be brilliant at all of these things at work.
[00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:24.080]   The question is, can you bring them home?"
[00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:25.360]   It sounds like you made that change.
[00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:26.000]   So there's hope.
[00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:27.200]   I'm a work in progress.
[00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:28.160]   But yes, I did.
[00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:32.480]   And I think I'm proud to say that my friends would say of me now that I'm a much better
[00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:33.120]   listener.
[00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:37.520]   Well, my big action item is to go find a listening class, because I feel like that's
[00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:39.360]   something that I'm incredibly interested in.
[00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:40.480]   So thank you for sharing that.
[00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:43.520]   Where do we want to send people if they want to go check out everything you've been writing
[00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:44.800]   and talking about?
[00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:46.080]   All the usual places.
[00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:48.880]   The Instagram, the LinkedIn, YouTube.
[00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:51.840]   It's, you know, the bookshop.
[00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:58.160]   My rule is it's my job to find a way to get my message where people are, not tell them
[00:59:58.160 --> 00:59:59.200]   where I want them to go.
[00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:01.600]   So wherever you like to go, I'll try and be there.
[01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:02.740]   Love it.
[01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:04.460]   Thank you so much for doing this.
[01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:05.460]   You're welcome.
[01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:06.460]   Thanks, Chris.
