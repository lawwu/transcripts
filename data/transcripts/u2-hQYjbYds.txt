[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.400]   - Podcast listener Dawn writes in to ask this,
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.260]   "Pastor John, when you say God is most glorified in us
[00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.780]   "when we are most satisfied in Him,
[00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.160]   "could you substitute the word by for in?
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.740]   "It seems easier to understand
[00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.920]   "if you say God is most glorified by us
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.660]   "when we are most satisfied by Him."
[00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.320]   So what do you think about this change up in words,
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.160]   Pastor John?
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.140]   (laughing)
[00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.120]   - Oh my, I love words.
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.840]   And they are so slippery and so,
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.900]   connotations and denotations are so different.
[00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.300]   But here we go, Dawn, let me give a try to why I,
[00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.380]   after thinking through the possibility
[00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.000]   of going with your suggestion,
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.460]   God is most glorified by us
[00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.940]   when we are most satisfied by Him.
[00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.580]   I am gonna stay with in,
[00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.440]   and I've got reasons in both halves.
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.920]   I think it communicates what I wanna communicate
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.780]   better than by, so let me try to explain.
[00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.200]   First, it might be helpful just to make sure
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.180]   everybody knows what I mean by that sentence.
[00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.940]   God is most glorified in us
[00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.680]   when we're most satisfied in Him.
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.880]   I don't mean that there aren't any other ways
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.800]   to glorify God than being satisfied in Him.
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.280]   I mean that if that is missing,
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.560]   then He's not glorified most.
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.740]   Something very important is missing.
[00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.740]   And I don't mean God doesn't get glory
[00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.200]   from the lives of unbelievers in certain ways
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.380]   who aren't finding any satisfaction in Him,
[00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.000]   because they're reflecting the image of God
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.180]   in which they were created,
[00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.040]   even if they don't believe that.
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.180]   And even if they turn out to be objects of God's wrath
[00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.700]   because of their unbelief and rebellion,
[00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.060]   that will reflect His justice and the glory of His justice.
[00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.980]   So I'm not talking about how God is glorified in unbelievers
[00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.060]   who don't find satisfaction in God.
[00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.740]   I'm talking about us, us.
[00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.580]   God is most glorified in us,
[00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.060]   believers, when we are most satisfied in Him.
[00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.840]   In other words, if a believer thinks being satisfied
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.460]   in God emotionally is a marginal issue
[00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.800]   or a merely optional issue,
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.800]   he is gravely mistaken because he's indifferent
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.740]   to how he can show God to be more glorious.
[00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.020]   You ought not to be indifferent to something
[00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.400]   that shows God to be more glorious.
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.860]   And the reason God is most glorified in us
[00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.780]   when we're most satisfied in Him
[00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.780]   is that the way God designed emotions to work is that way.
[00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:03.140]   A boss who is obeyed at work,
[00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.880]   but not enjoyed, not admired,
[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.220]   we all know he's not honored
[00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.020]   as much as if he were both obeyed and enjoyed.
[00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.260]   That's what emotions say.
[00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.540]   That's the way God set them up to work.
[00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.740]   It says, "You have remarkable qualities
[00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.820]   that make me glad to obey you."
[00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.360]   And those remarkable qualities
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.600]   that add gladness to the obedience
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.780]   give him more honor and more glory
[00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.000]   than if he only was obeyed.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.060]   So that's what I mean by the sentence.
[00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.380]   Now, why use the word in instead of by?
[00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.740]   Let's just start with the second half.
[00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.460]   When we are most satisfied in Him,
[00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.660]   not satisfied by Him.
[00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.660]   And the reason is that the word by Him
[00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.860]   could mean he's the one who satisfies us
[00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.200]   with something other than himself.
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.740]   A teenager might say,
[00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.060]   "I got to go to the game with my friends
[00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.780]   and that satisfied me."
[00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:07.780]   And then he could add,
[00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.700]   "And my dad drove us to the game
[00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.260]   so that I was satisfied by the game
[00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.700]   and I was thus satisfied by my dad."
[00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.940]   But the dad wasn't the satisfaction.
[00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.260]   The dad was just the means
[00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.140]   to get the satisfaction in the game.
[00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.460]   And that's emphatically not what I want to say.
[00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.980]   So if I say, "When we are most satisfied by God,"
[00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.260]   it's possible someone might take me to mean
[00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.940]   that God is the one who's given me such good gifts
[00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.420]   in my life, my marriage, my family, my job,
[00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:40.980]   and those satisfy me so much
[00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.380]   and therefore I've been satisfied by God
[00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.940]   giving me those gifts in which I find so much pleasure.
[00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.480]   Now, I don't want anybody to take me to mean that,
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.180]   even though it's good to enjoy God's gifts.
[00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.420]   I don't mean to say that.
[00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:00.100]   So I say, "When we are satisfied in God,"
[00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.060]   that is, God himself is the object of the satisfaction,
[00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:09.060]   not just the supplier of the object of the satisfaction.
[00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.580]   So that's the reason I want to use it in the second half.
[00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.580]   Now, in the first half, "God is most glorified in us,"
[00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.620]   instead of "God is most glorified by us,"
[00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.620]   they almost, almost are identical in meaning in my mind.
[00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.820]   And so I just used in because it sounds better
[00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:30.060]   to have in in both halves
[00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.260]   rather than by in one half and in in the other half.
[00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.460]   However, there is a slight difference
[00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.220]   that I think would make me want to have it anyway.
[00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.300]   The word in, when you use it in the first half,
[00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.380]   "God is most glorified in us,"
[00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:48.380]   takes the focus off of my intentionality to glorify him.
[00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:55.100]   When I say, "God is glorified in us,"
[00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.380]   I'm not calling any attention to our intention
[00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.800]   to glorify him in that moment.
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.380]   Whereas, "God is most glorified by us"
[00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:10.380]   does seem to call attention to our intention to glorify him.
[00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.700]   And you would ask, rightly,
[00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:16.220]   well, why in the world would it be bad
[00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:20.660]   to call attention to our intention to glorify God?
[00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.300]   And here's the problem.
[00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.220]   This is why words are so delicate.
[00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:30.060]   Glorifying God by enjoying him
[00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:35.060]   can't be intentional in the moment of the enjoyment of God.
[00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:39.620]   That's not the way pleasure works.
[00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:40.460]   Try it.
[00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.140]   I mean, just try it right now.
[00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:47.140]   Say, "Okay, soul, my intention right now is to glorify God.
[00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:51.860]   So now, go ahead, soul, rejoice in him."
[00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:53.220]   It doesn't work.
[00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.300]   The nature of the emotions
[00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:01.300]   is that they are psychological ends in themselves
[00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.240]   if they are authentic.
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:08.740]   For example, you can't authentically fear
[00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:12.900]   in order to make a bear charging you look terrifying.
[00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:14.380]   You can't do it for that reason.
[00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:17.500]   You can't say, "Okay, now, I'm supposed to feel fear
[00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.620]   right now because I want people to know
[00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:23.140]   that I am making much of the horrible look
[00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:25.380]   on that bear's face as he charges me.
[00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:27.860]   So go ahead, heart, fear
[00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:29.780]   in order to make him look terrifying."
[00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:33.340]   Emotions are not that kind of thing.
[00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:37.600]   So either fear wells up in you at the approach of the bear
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:42.420]   or it doesn't, and you can't make it intentional.
[00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:45.700]   You can't authentically feel sorrow
[00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:49.560]   in order to help a grieving person feel loved.
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.240]   So you want to say, "Well, I'd like that person
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.880]   to feel loved right now,
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.580]   and I'm not feeling any sorrow for their loss.
[00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:00.020]   So soul, we want to make them feel loved.
[00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:03.140]   So right now, would you feel sorrow, soul?"
[00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:04.300]   It doesn't work.
[00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.580]   If the loss in that person's life
[00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:10.460]   doesn't make you feel sorrow authentically right now
[00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:13.900]   without any intentionality to do anything for them,
[00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:16.580]   just because you feel sorrow,
[00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:19.020]   then you're not going to be able to communicate love
[00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:19.840]   to that person.
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:21.460]   Emotions don't work like that.
[00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:26.460]   Neither does joy in God, in God.
[00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:30.980]   If God's glory, His love, His power, wisdom,
[00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:34.300]   justice, truth, and all of His other glorious attributes,
[00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:39.300]   if they don't awaken spontaneous joy in God,
[00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:43.240]   you can't pause and say,
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:47.260]   "Well, God Himself doesn't awaken joy in me,
[00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.480]   but I know I'm supposed to glorify Him.
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:53.540]   So now soul, start rejoicing in Him."
[00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:56.720]   That's just not the way it works.
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.620]   So that's what I want to avoid
[00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:02.700]   by not using the word "by,"
[00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.980]   but using the word "in."
[00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:07.540]   God is most glorified in us.
[00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:09.780]   I'm not calling any attention
[00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:12.780]   to my intentionality in that moment,
[00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:14.260]   because in that moment,
[00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.180]   it's okay to intend to glorify God with our emotions.
[00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:18.000]   I do that.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.100]   Right now, I'm talking to you.
[00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:21.260]   I'm intending that in the future days,
[00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.740]   I hope John Piper will be so happy in God,
[00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:25.380]   people will see God as glorious.
[00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:29.420]   But in the very moment of the pleasure of God
[00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:31.540]   in worship or in devotions
[00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:33.440]   or in some sight of His glory,
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.960]   in the gospel, in that moment,
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:38.500]   there's no standing outside yourself
[00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:40.460]   and saying, "I'm doing that,"
[00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:43.540]   in order to make that God look great.
[00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:47.020]   So my answer is I'm sticking by "in,"
[00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:50.780]   in both halves for those reasons,
[00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:53.180]   and maybe some more that I can't even remember.
[00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:55.020]   Very well put.
[00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:56.300]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:59.340]   At Desiring God, we believe joy is not optional.
[00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:00.580]   It's essential.
[00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:02.140]   And if this is new to you,
[00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:04.540]   I would invite you to watch a little four-minute video
[00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:06.260]   we have at our site.
[00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.460]   Go to DesiringGod.org and click on the About tab
[00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:10.900]   at the top of the screen.
[00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:12.480]   There you can find a short film,
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:13.900]   a little introduction to who we are
[00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:15.340]   and what we're all about.
[00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:17.220]   Well, speaking of our joy in God,
[00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:18.860]   if God is all that we need,
[00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:22.420]   then why was God not enough for Adam in the garden?
[00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:25.040]   Why was it not good for him to be alone?
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:27.300]   It's an important relational question,
[00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:28.580]   and we'll address it tomorrow.
[00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:29.420]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:31.980]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:34.140]   (silence)
[00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:36.300]   (silence)
[00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:38.460]   (silence)
