[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.040]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.120]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.380]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.280]   My name is Joshua. I am your host, and today we continue our credit card series. I introduced
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.680]   the series last week with a discussion on credit cards, credit card debt. On Friday,
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.880]   we did a live Q&A entirely devoted to credit cards. I hope you really enjoyed that. I enjoyed
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.520]   the diversity of questions that we received. And today we continue that series because
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:35.120]   this is launch week for my newest course called How to Borrow Money and Never Pay Interest
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:41.000]   Using Credit Cards. Sorry, I can't even get my own title right. How to Borrow Money Safely
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.840]   and Never Pay Interest Using Credit Cards. You know, I struggled and struggled with wordsmithing
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.120]   on that course title. I don't know if that's the best. Maybe I'll be able to come up with
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.920]   another better title in the future. But it just encompasses the three things that I want
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.680]   you to be aware of, which is that credit cards can be a very safe way for you to borrow money,
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.720]   depending on how we define the term safe. They can also be a very inexpensive way of
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.860]   borrowing money with no interest payments, very low interest payments, if you know what
[00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.920]   you're doing. And of course, we're using credit cards. Now, those are some big ifs, but I'm
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.680]   very confident and I stand behind the validity of these strategies. They are carefully researched.
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.720]   They're things that I have done that I used to think everybody did. When I was in credit
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.680]   card debt, I played the zero percent credit card game and I thought everybody knew how
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.080]   to play it. And I learned over time, frankly, that nobody knows how to play it very well.
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.280]   Excuse me. I've only a very few people know how to play it. And so this course kind of
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.460]   synthesizes some things that I've never seen brought together before. An understanding
[00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.920]   of credit scores, how credit scores work, how credit cards are issued, and then an understanding
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.180]   of the legality of how to position yourself for maximum safety using credit cards. So
[00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.040]   this week we're going to be continuing this series and the bulk of this week will be dedicated
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:02.680]   to sharing with you excerpts and specific audio excerpts from the course. I'm going
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.620]   to have today in today's show is going to continue that. I have about a 10 or 15 minute
[00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.840]   sales pitch here for you at the beginning, which you'll find interesting. Stay with me
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.920]   because I really want you to buy the course, but I want you to have a good, solid understanding
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.000]   of it so that you can understand if it's right for you. And then towards the back end of
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.920]   today's audio, I'm going to share with you the first audio excerpt from the course, which
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.880]   is called credit card debt is a very safe form of debt. Sharing with you part of my
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.200]   arguments for credit cards. Tomorrow I'm going to be sharing with you an audio excerpt called
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.800]   credit card loans can provide a way to privately purchase goods and services. One of the benefits
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.440]   of credit cards. I alluded to this in the Friday Q and a show, but I'm going to give
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.480]   you the entire audio from the course, specifically from the course. Wednesday we'll, I'll share
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.960]   with you a segment called how to manage cash while you pay off your credit cards. I think
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:57.200]   you'll find that very helpful because unfortunately, if you don't know this in advance, what you
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.160]   wind up really getting hurt. Many people who wind up deeply in credit card debt, wind up
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.720]   there with no cash to their name. And that's a bad place to be. As you'll see in that,
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.720]   in that segment on Thursday, I'm going to be sharing with you a show called who shouldn't
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.680]   have credit cards or frankly, who shouldn't take my course because there are people I
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.280]   believe who shouldn't have credit cards. And I didn't, this is not part of the actual course.
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.360]   This is just going to be a standalone podcast. And then on Friday, I'll be bringing to you
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:30.160]   one more live Q and a call, which will be all about credit cards with specific questions
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.840]   and answers and specific strategies for anyone who has purchased the course that that particular
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.680]   live Q and a call will be available to anybody who is a student of the course. If you'd like
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.720]   to get on that, we'll have as much time as you want to talk about your situation, brainstorm
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.680]   ideas and strategies that will help you. Now, I'm going to give you here about, like I said,
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.760]   about 10 minutes of discussion on the course. And here's why I have a challenge with being
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:59.360]   a podcast host. And the challenge is you're listening to me at a time where it's not easy
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.640]   for you to go and send me money. You're listening to me while you drive down the road and you
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.560]   can't pull over, well you could, but you're unlikely to pull over and take out your credit
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.720]   card and sign up for my course on your phone. You're listening to me while you're running
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.080]   through the local park, getting your morning exercise or pumping iron in the gym. And so
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:20.320]   I need to give you enough information here so that you'll be incentivized this week to
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.120]   go and to buy my course. And I really want you to do that because I believe this will
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.560]   serve you and it will help you save money. Really, really feel good about the value that
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:36.960]   I have created for you. So who should buy this particular course? Well, very simply,
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:45.040]   if you currently have a credit card of any kind, or if in the future you think you might
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:53.640]   ever have a credit card of any kind, I recommend to you my course. Now, this is not hyperbole.
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:59.760]   I'm not engaging in puffery here. I'm sincere about this. I want to deliver huge amounts
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.160]   of value in everything that I do. If you've listened to the show, you know that one of
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:09.800]   my things that I try, do my very best is to deliver far more than I ever charge. And I
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:19.640]   have put that same theory, that same impetus into this course. Most of us bumble into credit
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:27.800]   card debt. Most of us don't approach the prospect with any forethought. The way that most of
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:34.160]   us wind up signing up for a credit card is out of a place of convenience, as in, "Hey,
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.720]   I'm 18 and they started sending me credit card notices. That was my first credit card."
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:44.880]   Or out of a place of need, as in, "Hey, I just lost my job." Or, "Hey, I want to buy
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.200]   something and I don't have the money, so I'll just sign up for a 0% introductory rate credit
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:54.360]   card." Or worse, we're just deeply in debt and trying to figure out how to get out. And
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:06:01.360]   we usually bumble in. I've hardly met the person who could accurately explain to me
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:07.640]   the benefits and drawbacks of a credit card. What happens is, depending on our own experience,
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:12.080]   we tend to highlight one thing versus another. For example, some people say, "Well, I love
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.560]   using my credit card because I get all kinds of airline miles and airline points. I've
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.240]   talked to so many people and studied their spending, and I'm convinced they spend so
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:25.960]   much more money on their credit card than they ever get benefit from their airline miles
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:31.400]   and their cashback points. There are good studies to demonstrate that, to show that
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:36.640]   the actual value that most people receive from those types of programs is very, very
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:42.040]   low." Now, it doesn't have to be that way. You could compare people like I've sat with
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:46.360]   who have one credit card and it goes for their favorite airline and they just use it for
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:50.560]   everything and that's their goal. If you compare that with somebody who's very strategic
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:56.520]   about the credit card churning game and applying for 10, 15, 20, 25 credit cards per year in
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.520]   order to get the airline points and the hotel points, there's no difference. Sorry, there's
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:04.540]   no comparison between the benefit that these people get. But what makes the difference
[00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:09.160]   is the plan and the strategy. So there are people who are in that situation. But then
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.880]   there are also people who wind up deeply in credit card debt with very high interest rates
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:19.200]   and they're so burned by the industry that they swear, "I'm never again going to borrow
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:24.800]   money on credit cards." Well, I'm sympathetic to that position, but don't think that it
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:31.600]   was necessarily either/or. Part of the reason why you have very high interest rates is because
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:37.160]   you're simply ignorant of how the industry works. You don't know how to make the industry
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:42.840]   work for you. So instead of you being able to exploit the credit card industry for your
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:48.480]   own benefit, you are being exploited. You don't know the rules of the game. You don't
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:52.200]   know what goes in your credit score. You don't know how to improve your credit score. You
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:56.040]   don't know how to apply for credit cards in a way that will actually serve you. And because
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:03.360]   of that, you wind up being abused by the industry. And I want to help avoid that. So I want to
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:08.200]   give you the education that you need to avoid being abused by the industry and also possibly
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:12.720]   to help other people. Now, a lot of times by the time people admit to you that they
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:18.160]   need help, frankly, it's too late. Now they can improve situations. And I should note
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:22.200]   this, even if you've done everything poorly up till now, you can always improve. The credit
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:26.200]   card industry is a very responsive industry. You can make major changes in your credit
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:30.640]   score in a relatively short period of time. Over a period of a few years, you can make
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:34.000]   dramatic improvements in your credit score. And the more you improve your credit score,
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.880]   the more offers are available, the more the industry exists for you. It's a multi-billion
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:42.840]   dollar industry that just wants to lend you money at cheap rates, but you need to know
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:48.880]   how to use it. Now, this particular course, again, it's called How to Borrow Money Safely
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:53.760]   and Never Pay Interest Using Credit Cards. This course currently has about 45 lessons
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:58.080]   in it. These lessons are anywhere from 6 to 12 to 15 minutes long. I would guess I didn't
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:03.460]   go back and measure every minute, but I think it's about four hours total of audio instruction.
[00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:07.200]   This course is very carefully edited. There's no time wasting, there's no rambling, there's
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:12.360]   no repetition. It's very carefully edited with what I thought is the most important
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:17.200]   things for you to know and to implement in your life. The course is a series of video
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:21.600]   and audio lectures. The video and audio are together, and there are detailed written outlines
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:26.600]   that you can have to refer back to as well to make a very efficient use of your time.
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:33.440]   This course will equip you with the knowledge you need to be competent in the credit card
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:40.320]   business. I'm selling the course for $39. $39 is the standard retail price. I am hosting
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:45.880]   a one-week promo introductory period. For the next week, I'll give you a $10 discount
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:55.000]   on it. So for the next week until Monday, October 15, 2018, this course, you can buy
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:01.840]   it for $29. There's no question in my mind that you'll get multiple, more than 10 times
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:07.560]   value out of your expenditure of the $29. Consider this, many people will pay on their
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:11.880]   credit cards about 18% interest. That's not uncommon. Now, of course, you can get credit
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:16.120]   cards that are lower, but most people will wind up, if you actually look and read the
[00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:20.880]   terms on your card, most people will wind up with a credit card that pays about 18%
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:33.000]   interest. $29 is equivalent to one month's interest payment on a $1,933 credit card debt.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.960]   So let's just round up for easy verbal math, $2,000. $29 is equivalent to one month's
[00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:44.100]   interest at 18% on a $2,000 credit card debt. Now, if you study the numbers on the amount
[00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:49.140]   of debt, a credit card debt that the average American household holds, the median debt
[00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:56.200]   per household of all households is $2,300. Now again, remember, median means 50% of households
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:01.560]   have more than this number. 50% of households have less than this number. This is not a
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:05.360]   number that's skewed by the big balances. It's the median number, which is usually the
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:10.360]   most realistic, accurate number to work from. So the median debt per American household
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:15.920]   is about $2,300 on credit cards. Now, the mean debt, the average debt per American household
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:23.040]   is $5,700. But if we take out all the households that don't carry credit card debt, the average
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:32.080]   for credit card balance carrying households is about $9,300 in the United States. $9,300.
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:37.040]   So if you run the math, I'm trying to give you a killer of a deal because I really want
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:42.200]   you to buy this course. If you run the math, $29 will save you potentially a lot of money.
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:49.360]   If you can cut that interest rate from 18% to 0%, to 3%, to 5% by understanding what
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:54.200]   you're doing and how to play the credit card game, I can save you huge amounts of money.
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:58.200]   I really want to encourage you. So here's how you buy. All this information is in the

[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:29.960]   four hours and say, "Eh, Joshua, it wasn't worth 29 bucks," I can't imagine how you would

[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:45.120]   the course. The audio, which is called Credit Card Debt is a Very Safe Form of Debt. This
[00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:49.780]   audio comes with both audio and video in the course with a detailed outline, but you'll
[00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:55.120]   just hear the audio here. It's called Credit Card Debt is a Very Safe Form of Debt. Enjoy
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:15:00.200]   this particular module, which is an excerpt from my case for credit cards in the very
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:07.640]   beginning of the course. What about credit card debt? Because of course, many people
[00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:11.840]   use credit cards and never accumulate credit card debt. They just simply pay the balance
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:17.800]   in full when it is due. Well, credit card debt is a very safe form of debt if you consider
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:26.040]   the actual fundamental attributes of the type of debt represented by credit card debt. First,
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:34.380]   most importantly, credit card debt is unsecured debt. This means that there is no specific
[00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:42.440]   collateral tied to the debt. It's unsecured debt. Other types of debt are indeed issued
[00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:50.880]   with direct collateral. For example, if you purchase a car using a car loan, the terms
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:56.820]   of the car loan that you agree to with the lender will indicate that the car is to serve
[00:15:56.820 --> 00:16:05.120]   as collateral for the financial loan. And in that debt agreement with the lender, they
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:10.240]   have the right, if you don't make your payments as agreed, they have the right to send the
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:15.460]   repo man to hook up the car in your driveway or in the parking lot at work and drag it
[00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:19.960]   back to them. And they don't have to go to a court or get a judge's approval or have
[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:23.540]   any interaction with law enforcement. They don't have to notify you in any way. They
[00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:29.600]   just send the repo man and the car disappears. That's because the car is serving as collateral
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:37.040]   for the debt. Another example, of course, would be a mortgage. If you don't pay a home
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:45.520]   mortgage as agreed, the lender has the right to foreclose on you fairly quickly. And if
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:51.080]   they foreclose on your house, they can evict you forcibly from the house, repossess the
[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:57.580]   house and sell it because the house serves as collateral for the debt. That's very
[00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:04.120]   different than credit card debt because credit card debt is issued with no direct collateral.
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:12.120]   It's a naked promise to pay. If you default on the debt, well, the items that you purchased
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:18.880]   with your credit card are not directly attachable by your creditor. They can't show up and
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:23.840]   because you swiped the card and used it to buy a backyard fire pit, they can't send
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:27.520]   the repo man in the middle of the night and take the backyard fire pit right out of your
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:34.800]   backyard. There is the opportunity at the end of a long line of legal dispute where
[00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:41.040]   they can come after you if they have a legal judgment and seek to take your property as
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:49.040]   settlement and payment for the money that you owe them. But that is not a direct relationship.
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:54.560]   If you are late on your credit card debt or if you don't pay your credit card debt,
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:18:01.560]   they can't automatically come and take the items that you purchased. This is a significant
[00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:08.360]   measure of safety that many people just simply ignore. If I were choosing to buy a car and
[00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:13.680]   I didn't have the cash to pay for it and I were offered the ability to either take
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:22.080]   out a five or $10,000 car loan or to take a five or $10,000 cash advance on a credit
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:28.320]   card, either way I could buy the car. But I personally would choose to take the five
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:34.400]   or $10,000 cash advance on a credit card because if I run into financial trouble and am unable
[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:42.200]   to pay that debt in a timely manner, I have a much greater safety with the credit card
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:46.880]   debt because they can't send the repo man to take the car. So at least I will still
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:51.800]   be able to use the car to get to work to earn the money that I need to earn in order for
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:56.000]   me to be able to ultimately pay back the debt instead of all of a sudden finding myself
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.600]   in a difficult financial situation and now the repo man took my car so I can't get
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:08.380]   to work. Now the major caveat here as we will discuss is the potential risk and the potential
[00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:13.380]   higher interest cost of credit card debt versus car loans. But that's what this entire course
[00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:19.400]   is about because if you have good credit, you can purchase that car using a cash advance
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:28.120]   and pay a very, very low, almost 0% effective interest rate. Credit card debt, because it's
[00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:35.560]   unsecured debt, is very, very safe. Additionally, credit card debt is a type of debt that can
[00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:42.480]   generally be fully discharged in bankruptcy. Now the specific details of a bankruptcy court
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:48.280]   will depend on the specific situation of the debtor and the complex mix of assets and the
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:53.200]   type of bankruptcy protection being sought by the debtor. But of all the types of debt
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:58.000]   that you could have, mortgage debt, car debt, private loans, credit cards, credit card debt
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:05.560]   is some of the safest debt because it can generally be fully discharged in bankruptcy.
[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:10.400]   One of the most infamous types of debt that cannot be discharged in federal bankruptcy
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:18.000]   court is student loan debt. If I owe $10,000 in student loans and I go through bankruptcy
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.120]   court, on the other side of bankruptcy court, I will continue to owe that $10,000 in student
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:32.160]   loans. So if I were personally choosing to go to school and I were choosing to borrow
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:38.440]   money to pay for my school expenses, I would rather put those school expenses on a credit
[00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:46.560]   card versus a student loan because the credit card debt, if I were in a worst case scenario
[00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:52.640]   and forced to declare bankruptcy, that credit card debt would be fully discharged in bankruptcy
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:59.920]   whereas the student loan debt would not be discharged. These are examples of why credit
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:06.320]   card debt is a very safe form of debt.
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:12.900]   The credit card default process is a very reasonable process when you actually look
[00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:19.080]   at the details and you are able to enjoy a significant amount of protection as a debtor
[00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:24.600]   in this process. First, if you default on your credit card debt, you won't immediately
[00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:32.040]   face legal problems. You will merely face significantly higher borrowing costs and a
[00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:38.400]   civil dispute with your credit card company, but you won't immediately face legal problems.
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:44.200]   You haven't broken any laws by being late on a credit card payment. You've simply
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:50.520]   broken the contract and now the credit card issuing company will respond by assessing
[00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:56.640]   penalties and fees. But it's important to be able to stay out of court and as we'll
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:02.040]   discuss in a moment, because the credit card process of settling that dispute is very long,
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:07.840]   you'll have ample time to be able to settle your problems with your lender while still
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:11.160]   being able to stay out of court.
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:17.760]   Credit card issuers are frequently reasonable and willing to reduce the penalties and fees
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:22.680]   they've levied upon you for being late on your debt and often they're even willing
[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:28.500]   to settle that debt with you when you're able to make significant payments to them.
[00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:34.280]   So in a worst case scenario where you have defaulted on your debt, you can reasonably
[00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:40.440]   expect to work with those credit card issuers and settle the affair out of court. As you're
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:45.680]   able to put together the money and pay them what you owe, you can settle that out of court,
[00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:47.360]   which is helpful.
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:53.600]   And very importantly, given the nature of credit card debt collections, the pathway
[00:22:53.600 --> 00:23:01.720]   through a lawsuit and potential legal judgment is a very long pathway, which gives you ample
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:08.480]   time to generate the money that you need to repay your loans and settle with your creditors
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:13.080]   out of court, thus avoiding legal trouble.
[00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:18.120]   So the actual process of default, in addition to your having significant legal protections
[00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:24.920]   because it's unsecured debt, the actual normal process is very reasonable and it gives
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:31.040]   you the time that you need in a worst case scenario to put together the money and pay
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:36.640]   your creditors, thus being able to avoid legal problems. And along the way, you can continue
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:40.520]   to use the assets that you've purchased or the services that you've purchased with the
[00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:48.680]   credit card in order to help you stay out of court and to help you put the money together
[00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:53.120]   in order for you to be able to pay your debts.
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:59.320]   So the credit card debt itself is a very safe form of debt.
