[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   David in Bristol, Connecticut writes in and asks this, "Pastor John, over the last year,
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   the Lord has taught me much about prayer, both by study of His Word and by lots of doing and failing at it.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   While I'm sure there will always be some mystery to prayer, the one thing that I've always struggled with
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   is how to know if and when to stop praying for something, especially related to 1 John 5:14-17,
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   since God's timing is rarely, if ever, ours, how do we know when to persevere in asking Him for something
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   and when to stop, because nothing is changing and it seems to be God saying no?"
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   Well, this is one of these questions where I'm going to see how much I can say when I don't know the answer.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   And I hope it's not fog, and I'm saying it up front so everybody will know it's not, I'm not trying to hide it.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   I don't know for sure, but this may help. It helps me to think out loud like this.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   Isn't it significant? I think it is.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   That in the Bible, we have a statement, "You have not because you asked not," James 4:2.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   But we don't have a statement, "You prayed too much or too long."
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   We don't have a statement that says, "You have things I did not want to give you
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   because you kept on asking me when it was time to quit."
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   We don't have anything like that.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   In fact, all the emphasis in the New Testament is in the other direction.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   Keep on praying. Don't lose heart. Ask, seek, knock.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Wake up your friend at midnight if you must.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Go back to the city judge over and over until he gives you justice, even though he just wants you off his back.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   I mean, those are amazing, horrible pictures of God.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   And the point is, he loves when we keep on coming and badgering him for something we want very badly
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   according to his revealed will.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   But here we have this difficult verse that was referred to in the question, John 5, 16.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   "If anyone sees his brother committing a sin not leading to death, he shall ask,
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   and God will forgive him to those who commit sins that do not lead to death."
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   There is sin that leads to death.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   I do not say one should pray for that.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   All wrongdoing is sin, but there is sin that does not lead to death.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   That's 1 John 5, 16 and 17.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Now notice, it does not say, "Don't pray about sin that leads to death."
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   It says simply, "There is sin that leads to death. I don't say that one should pray for that."
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   It does amount, doesn't it, to a permission at least not to pray about sin that leads to death.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   And that's what makes the question so hard, like David says.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   How do we know? How do we know when a person has sinned unto death?
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   That is, there's not going to be any forgiveness.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   He's hardened himself so many times and so long, God has withdrawn from him,
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   and there's not going to be any repentance on his part,
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   and therefore not going to be any forgiveness on God's part.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   How do we know when that's happened?
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   It's not a particular sin. Get that out of the courtroom right away.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   It's not murder or rape or treason, because it doesn't say "the sin," like the unforgivable sin.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   That's not what this is about. It's not "the sin" or "a sin" that leads to death.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   It is sin or sinning unto death.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   It's not the act. It's the depth and irreversibility of the act
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   that a person has sinned so long they're not able to repent anymore.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   But how do we know that? And the answer is, "I don't know."
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   But it might help to point to an analogy with a similar kind of difficulty.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   Jesus said in Matthew 7, "Do not give dogs what is holy,
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   and do not throw your pearls before pigs,
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   lest they trample them under foot and turn to attack you."
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   So there seems to be a kind of hardness and resistance and cynical attitude
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   that you should not share the most precious truths with.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   People are so utterly hard and cynical
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   that they'll only trample your gospel words under their feet.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   How do we know when that is?
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   I mean, Paul spoke to people who then threw him in prison
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   and chanted songs for two hours to false gods.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   I mean, that's a lot of trampling going on in response to Paul's preaching.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   And Jesus spoke, and people killed him.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   That's trampling the pearl of great price.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   So, in the one case, we don't have to pray for certain hardened sinners.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   In the other case, we shouldn't give holy things to the certain hardened sinners.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   And when does that apply? I don't know.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   But it may be that just knowing that such situations exist
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   will help us, by the Holy Spirit, discern when we are in one.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   And I'll just say, last thing, Tony, that this hit home to me for my grandmother.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   She's gone now, and in heaven, I frankly doubt.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   But she's the closest one I came to where I almost said to the Lord,
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   "I'm not going to pray for her anymore."
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   She is so cynical to everything I say.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   She turns everything on its head.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   She's a terrible model for my grandkids, her grandkids,
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   and actually her great-grandkids.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   I say grandmother, great-grandmother.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   My parents were not like that.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   She was my grandmother, and so she was a bad example.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   But frankly, I couldn't stop.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   I couldn't bring myself to stop praying for her conversion.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   I've never, frankly, come to a situation where I've said,
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   "That person is beyond my prayers."
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   Excellent. That's very helpful, Pastor John. Thank you.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   And on this topic of prayer, be sure to check out episode #123 in this podcast,
