[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.040]   - Welcome back to the podcast.
[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.520]   Well, is the hobby of watercolor painting
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.700]   a wartime waste of time and money?
[00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.720]   That's the question today from a listener named Amy.
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.660]   Pastor John, hello to you and thank you for your ministry
[00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.140]   over these many years, she writes.
[00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.840]   I have benefited greatly from it.
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.000]   Your seashells message was especially profound to me, yes.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.080]   One of the classic John Piper sermons,
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.100]   which is titled "Boasting Only in the Cross"
[00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.380]   and preached on May 20th, 2000.
[00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.780]   But that sermon left me with a lingering question
[00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.400]   I've never resolved.
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.220]   Would you consider all hobbies like seashell collecting
[00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.280]   a waste of life?
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.240]   I ask because I recently took up watercolor painting.
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.080]   I keep asking myself, does this glorify God?
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.320]   And to what purpose does this further his kingdom?
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.940]   I'm not sure it does.
[00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.960]   Painting is a relaxing stress reliever for me
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.520]   and I've enjoyed using it to make homemade cards for people,
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.280]   but it seems it's mostly for my benefit and my enjoyment.
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.200]   You clearly have a category for hobbies.
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.660]   When Tony recently asked you to name your favorite hobbies,
[00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.760]   you said Scrabble with Noel and making your yard look perfect.
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.320]   That was an APJ 1882.
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.080]   So what guidelines can you offer us wartime Christians
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.040]   to discern when hobbies are God glorifying
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.400]   and when they become life wasting?
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.480]   When I first tackled this question nine years ago on APJ,
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.560]   I was reading biographies at the time,
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.320]   books about Hudson Taylor and by Hudson Taylor,
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.600]   the missionary, and I think Hudson Taylor at that time
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.720]   and now if he were alive would answer this question
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.480]   pretty bluntly and say, come on, come on,
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.640]   let's give our lives for the cause of the gospel,
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.020]   especially world evangelization.
[00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.800]   So I have that ringing in my ears even to this day.
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.920]   And I don't want to soft pedal how radical
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.960]   the Christian life is by being culturally adapting
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.960]   as a Christian and ignoring the horrific plight
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.840]   of the lost and the unreached of this world.
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.000]   But here's what I think needs to be said biblically.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.180]   We want to be biblical and not just draw out our own
[00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.480]   inferences from situations that may not accord
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.240]   with God's word.
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.840]   Yes, some people waste their lives playing.
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.140]   We just have to admit that.
[00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.640]   They do, their whole life is jumping from one fun thing
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.160]   to the next.
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.560]   What they really get excited about and what they spend
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.960]   most of their time, most of their life thinking about
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.480]   is the next gadget or the next vacation
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.120]   or the next streaming video series or the next concert
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.080]   or the next movie.
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.400]   If you want to get them animated, bring that up.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.880]   Not Jesus, don't bring up salvation.
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.520]   They won't have anything to say.
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.120]   There's no emotional kick there at all.
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.840]   Not the hope of glory, not adoption into God's family,
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.640]   not the forgiveness of sins, not the miracles of Jesus.
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.600]   Just what did you watch last week?
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.320]   And whoa, they come alive with all kinds
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.560]   of verbal statements that show they can talk
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.600]   if they want to talk, they can feel if they want to feel.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:24.400]   And those people give little thought to the biblical truth
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.680]   that their life is not their own.
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.040]   Paul said, you are not your own.
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.840]   You were bought with a price.
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.640]   So glorify God in your body.
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.120]   That's what you should think about with your body, your eyes,
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.520]   your ears, your hands, your tongue.
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.960]   Glorify God in your body.
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.360]   What could be more wonderful, more clear, more radical
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.400]   than that statement?
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.680]   You are not your own.
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.240]   You belong to God.
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.120]   Make him look great.
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.040]   And when you do, be excited about that.
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.200]   Do that with your hobbies.
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.040]   Those people act as if they can do whatever they please
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.040]   with no reference to the one who owns them or bought them.
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.440]   And those people need to hit pause, pause on their life.
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:22.480]   And ask, am I really born again?
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:28.200]   Do I have any of the affections of my Lord Jesus
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.840]   or my Father in heaven?
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.400]   Or are they all worldly?
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.760]   So to me, if you operate from that verse,
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:43.240]   1 Corinthians 6, 19, then you ask of your hobbies.
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.560]   And it doesn't make any difference
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.200]   whether the hobbies are collecting coins or shells
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.840]   or climbing mountains.
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:56.880]   You ask, is this the Lord's will for my life
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.240]   that he bought, that he owns?
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.240]   And to answer that question about the will of God,
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:10.120]   you ask, am I glorifying him in this hobby?
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:15.560]   Is this hobby serving to make him look great
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.240]   and beautiful and valuable?
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.720]   Is it making me like one who values his glory
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.280]   above everything?
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.800]   Paul said, whether you eat or drink, do a hobby.
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.840]   Whatever you do, whether you climb mountains or hunt deer
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.480]   or collect coins or do crossword puzzles
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.920]   or collect shells or paint watercolors,
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:47.600]   do it all, he says, to the glory of God.
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:52.800]   Make Christ look like the treasure that he is.
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.640]   Now, how does that happen in hobbies or in leisure
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.920]   or in recreation?
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.320]   Because I think it does.
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.440]   I will just mention three, three ways,
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.240]   three questions to ask.
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:15.280]   One, is the hobby, the leisure, the recreation, the hobby
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:23.720]   itself, a participation in God-exalting experiences?
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:29.240]   Now, this is not mainly about the effects of the hobby,
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.680]   but what it is in itself.
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.600]   Do you see God in it?
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:39.280]   Does your spirit come alive to God in it?
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.120]   Or is it dragging you down?
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.640]   Is it leading you to be more distant from Christ,
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:50.200]   more indifferent to him, more in love with the world
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.400]   and less in love with him?
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:58.200]   Now, I can easily imagine Amy's water color hobby feeding
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:04.280]   her soul spiritually as she looks at the world
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.200]   with the eyes of a worshipful Christian
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.680]   as she sees the glory of God and seeks
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:14.400]   to capture some of that beauty in what she paints,
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.800]   all the while being amazed that she herself
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:23.520]   is a kind of creator in the image of her creator.
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:28.360]   It seems to me that most hobbies that involve making things
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:32.320]   could have this worshipful effect of experiencing
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:38.160]   the wonder of being a maker like our God is a maker
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:43.200]   and then bending what we have made to God's service
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:50.520]   so that both the process and the product reflect God's glory.
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:54.240]   Number two, second question to ask,
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:57.600]   is the hobby, the leisure, the recreation,
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:02.960]   refreshing you physically, emotionally, spiritually
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:07.760]   for the other parts of your life where you need energy and focus
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:10.160]   to live for God's glory as part of your vocation
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.600]   or part of your family?
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:19.080]   Or is the hobby depleting you and weakening you
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:23.000]   and making you less able to do that part of your life
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.960]   to the glory of God?
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:29.080]   This is a question about physical depletion
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:36.520]   and spiritual depletion or weakening or even deadening.
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:41.440]   We need to be really honest whether what
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:47.200]   we're focusing on for hours is shaping our minds
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:51.880]   for greater spiritual alertness and wisdom and love and worship
[00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:59.600]   or misshaping our minds to be more at home with sin.
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.320]   Third question to ask.
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:05.960]   Last one, how is your hobby or leisure or recreation
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:12.600]   serving your relationship with other people for their good?
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:17.000]   And I ask it like that rather than what I used to say way
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.880]   back nine years ago when I thought about this question,
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:28.400]   namely, I ask, are you involving other people in your hobby?
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.840]   I'm not saying that now because I realized
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:35.800]   that there are recreations or hobbies or diversions that
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:40.920]   are specifically designed to isolate you,
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:44.200]   but not selfishly, not selfishly,
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.040]   but for loving reasons.
[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:49.600]   For example, one of the things I like
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:53.320]   to do besides scrabbles and yard work,
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:57.560]   I like to do is when I'm not under pressure
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:00.280]   to do what everybody else expects me to do
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:03.160]   is to write poetry.
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.800]   Now, this would be like Amy's watercolors, I think,
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:11.520]   only probably I am much more insistent than she would be
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:15.120]   that I must be left alone.
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:17.920]   She might be able to paint with people around her.
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:18.960]   I can't.
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:22.640]   Writing, especially disciplined creative writing,
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:27.280]   is intensely focused action.
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:31.520]   I cannot do it while others are around me.
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:35.400]   So the hobby itself is not gregarious.
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:38.000]   It's isolationist.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.680]   But my aim is always to write, to be read.
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:45.800]   I want to speak to somebody what I'm writing.
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:51.600]   I want to use it to encourage them and to glorify God with it.
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:53.760]   I want the poems to capture something
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:56.600]   about God and his word and his world
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:02.600]   that will awaken others to what I saw and experienced
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:07.080]   in a way that magnifies Christ.
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:11.480]   So I think it is a good question to ask,
[00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:15.960]   how is your hobby or your leisure serving
[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:19.320]   your relationship with other people for their good?
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:25.760]   The apostle Paul said in 1 Corinthians 16, 14,
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:29.400]   "Let all that you do be done in love."
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:32.240]   So he said on the one hand, "Let all that you do
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:33.840]   do it to the glory of God."
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:37.400]   And here he's saying, which I think is a subset,
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:40.280]   "Let all that you do be done in love."
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:41.400]   Love for people.
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:46.400]   So it is a good biblical question for all our hobbies.
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:51.440]   Is this expressing my love for others?
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:57.760]   Is this hobby forming me into a person who cares for others,
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.560]   wants to live for others' good, is
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:04.040]   willing to sacrifice for others?
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:08.360]   So I think if we're honest with those three questions,
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:12.360]   the financial part of the hobby will probably
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:13.880]   take care of itself.
[00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:19.480]   In other words, I think the God-focused, ministry-focused,
[00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:23.920]   love-focused emphasis of those questions
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:29.280]   will put a governor on any exorbitant spending
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:32.000]   in our support of the hobby.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.960]   We live in a very needy world.
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:38.360]   And one of the effects of those three questions
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:42.360]   will be to make us more alive to those needs
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:46.200]   so that we embrace a wartime lifestyle
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:50.760]   for the good of the world and the glory of Christ.
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:52.760]   How many seashells do you have in your home?
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:53.880]   I'm not aware of any.
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:54.380]   None?
[00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:54.880]   OK.
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:56.960]   But there might be some downstairs
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:58.120]   with a plant growing in it.
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:01.160]   Wonderful.
[00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:05.320]   My son-in-law has a jar of seashells
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:08.920]   in his office at church, which his wife insisted
[00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:09.680]   that he put there.
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:12.280]   And when he took a picture of it and put it on Twitter,
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:14.120]   he said, let the reader understand.
[00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:17.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:20.880]   Wonderful.
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.320]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.960]   And if you're still trying to figure out
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:26.840]   how and why John Piper and seashells go together,
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:30.680]   like peanut butter and jelly, or maybe like oil and water,
[00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:33.640]   maybe is a better way to put it, see APJ 1200,
[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:37.440]   APJ 1200, Reflections on the Seashell Sermon,
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:41.200]   18 Years Later, episode 1200 in the archive.
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:44.120]   That was a 2018 episode that we recorded.
[00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:46.000]   And can you believe we have not talked
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   about seashells on this podcast since that episode,
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   5 and 1/2 years ago?
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.800]   Seems hard to believe, but it's true.
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:54.080]   Who hosts this thing anyways?
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:55.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:55.960]   I do.
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.320]   Tony Reike, at your service.
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.120]   See you Monday.
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:02.180]   you
[00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:04.240]   you
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:14.240]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
