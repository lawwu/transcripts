[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.880]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.480]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.380]   Today on the show, I want to talk to you about probably your children, although this might
[00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.240]   apply to you, but primarily we're probably going to be talking to your children.
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.680]   And my title of today's show is this, why not skip high school and just graduate from
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:24.680]   college instead?
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.240]   I'm going to expand on that in today's show.
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:34.680]   I'm going to teach you how you can help your bright, academically capable high school student
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.680]   to graduate with a college degree at the age of 18, either instead of, or in addition to,
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.960]   their high school diploma or GED, which can open up a tremendously accelerated success
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.260]   path in life for them.
[00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.440]   The concepts that I'm about to discuss are applicable in almost any year, but I do want
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.960]   to anchor them in the current year.
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:06.400]   As I record this on July 27, 2020, we are living in, I don't know if we're in the beginning
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:12.380]   of, in the middle of, or near the end, who knows, but we're living in a global pandemic,
[00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.780]   the COVID-19 global pandemic.
[00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.520]   And this global pandemic is affecting different parts of the world differently.
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.240]   There are some nations that have been able to beat the pandemic back and they're operating
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.520]   more or less as they were accustomed to operating before the pandemic.
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.760]   There are other nations that are moderately affected by the pandemic and there are other
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.840]   nations that are severely affected by the pandemic.
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.360]   There is a very wide swath of the radical personal finance listening audience, which
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.200]   is living in places that are severely affected by the pandemic.
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.240]   Now I think this pandemic is having a number of positive results.
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.160]   I think there's a number of silver linings that we can observe in the midst of this pandemic.
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:04.880]   A couple of them though, relate to the physical distancing suggestions and requirements in
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.080]   which we are living.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.480]   I previously recorded a show on radical personal finance here talking about how your biggest
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:18.760]   career opportunity right now is that your current work can be moved online and can stay
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.040]   online.
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.400]   In that show I discussed how the opportunity to earn your income from anywhere in the world
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.440]   that you can set up an internet connection is probably the biggest potential lifestyle
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.160]   benefit you can have.
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.240]   And if you were to go back to the 1990s, you had to engage in all kinds of bird brain,
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:40.800]   you know, envelope stuffing jobs or really unusual careers.
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.280]   You know, if you were a back to the lander and you wanted to move out to the country
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.080]   and you had to figure out how to make a way, make an income from the country, you were
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.880]   limited to either the low income opportunities that were available in the country or you
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.680]   were limited to some really unusual careers or you needed to travel.
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.640]   Well, things improved in the early 2000s as the internet became more useful and more and
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:09.360]   more people were able to go online, especially those who did computer work specifically from
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.400]   the very beginning.
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.360]   And then online work became more and more mainstream.
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:20.340]   But even in 2020, there was still, prior to the pandemic, there was still an expectation
[00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.120]   that in office work was the standard.
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.840]   I think that expectation is changing and will continue to change.
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.680]   Now certainly many of us make a living in things that can never go online.
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.160]   But for those of us who do knowledge work, the move to online work is a tremendous lifestyle
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.160]   benefit.
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.040]   You can eliminate your commuting, you can move from the side of town that you don't
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.440]   like living on to the other side of town, you can move from the middle of the city to
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.160]   the country, you can move from the country to the middle of the city, whatever you want.
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.360]   You can move from one country to another country, live anywhere.
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.360]   And so it's a tremendous opportunity.
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.200]   That's something that I think we're getting good results from due to the pandemic.
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.120]   And I hope that you are making full use of that.
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.060]   But we're also getting a lot of opportunities in the field of education.
[00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.520]   And I think this is so powerful.
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:14.040]   First we're getting more parents involved in their children's education.
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.580]   The word I hear from people who are involved in things like local homeschooling groups
[00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:21.160]   is that the interest is extremely high.
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.120]   I don't see how parents can't at least notice a little bit more what was happening with
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.640]   their children's education if their children are doing online classes from home.
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.360]   At least they're going to see more and hear more than they previously were seeing and
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.520]   hearing when their child was in a local classroom.
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.280]   I think we're getting tremendous advances in teaching techniques that more and more
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.100]   people are learning how to teach online.
[00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.200]   This is going to open up new career opportunities for teachers.
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.680]   Once a teacher realizes, you know what, if I can effectively teach these hundred students
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.400]   in my local school online, then why shouldn't I just go ahead and establish a class for
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.540]   1,000 students on the other side of the world online and charge them for it?
[00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.640]   And so I think there's going to be a lot of teachers who are going to be able to take
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.440]   their teaching skill and ability and transform that into new careers.
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.320]   I think this is going to open up the world to where we get better teachers.
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.120]   I think there are many parents who are going to look down and realize, why should I have,
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.120]   you know, Mr. Jones at the local school who frankly is not all that bright, but he has
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.120]   the job.
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.720]   Why should I hire him to teach my child history or mathematics when I can hire, you know,
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.640]   Dr. Singh who is on the other side of the world, but he's brilliant and fantastic and
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.360]   he is able to teach so much more, right?
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.760]   I think there's a lot of parents that are going to realize that and start being careful
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:42.400]   in the teachers that they hire for their children's education and not just take what's given to
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.960]   them by the local government school district.
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.340]   There are a lot of more things that I could say.
[00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:51.960]   But what I see as the opportunity here is for you as a parent to take advantage of the
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:58.440]   fact that your child is forced to be in your home and use that to help your child get some
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.180]   bigger results.
[00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:06.940]   Now I need to emphasize as preamble before I get to the specific suggestions, I need
[00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:14.440]   to emphasize that you as a parent need to study your children and understand what your
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.200]   children need.
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.280]   You need to do what's best for your children.
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.200]   And so the ideas that I have to share with you will not be best for all children and
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.760]   they may not be best for your children.
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:32.220]   Our responsibility as parents is to understand the unique creatures that our children are
[00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:41.020]   and coach them, guide them, teach them in the way that they should go so that they can
[00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:44.900]   achieve the things that they're put here on earth to achieve.
[00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:51.860]   And to do that, we need to not try to apply a one size fits all system to them, but rather
[00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:57.660]   understand who they are uniquely and then seek to meet their unique skills, their unique
[00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:03.820]   talents, their unique personalities with things that will be helpful for them.
[00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:08.500]   With that as the foundation, let's talk about some ideas.
[00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:15.660]   I think the single biggest opportunity that a parent has to help their child get on the
[00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:24.020]   fast track, and here I want to restrict the fast track to academics and to their career.
[00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:26.980]   I don't know if this is a fast track socially for your child, although I don't see that
[00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:28.020]   it has to be a conflict.
[00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:32.040]   I don't know if this is the best for the development of your child, but these are the fast tracks
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.500]   for academics and for career.
[00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:38.460]   The single biggest opportunity that you have as a parent is to help your child to move
[00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:45.540]   onto a fast track educationally by getting rid of the fluff that is designed for low
[00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:52.900]   achieving children and moving them into a level of studies that's going to challenge
[00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:56.460]   them.
[00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:04.140]   It's my general observation that education, hear the air quotes, right?
[00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:10.700]   Education, schooling has largely been brought down to a very low academic level.
[00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:13.300]   We can debate why that is.
[00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:17.060]   We can debate if that was some kind of intentional conspiracy, right?
[00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:19.100]   Dumbing us down for some reason.
[00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:27.680]   We can debate if that was just an outgrowth of certain overall trends, maybe more, right?
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.340]   You could say, well, more students are in school now.
[00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:34.620]   Now everyone's in school and so it wasn't just the intellectual elite of yesteryear
[00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:36.860]   that now have access to school.
[00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:37.860]   You decide for yourself.
[00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:44.300]   But it's my observation that the average academic expectation or the academic expectation for
[00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:51.240]   the average student has changed a lot in the last 75 to 100 years.
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:09:01.620]   The rigor of school has dramatically decreased for the majority of schools.
[00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:05.180]   I think, can't prove this, just an opinion.
[00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:12.440]   I think that what used to be learned in primary school has now been stretched out to at least
[00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:13.840]   high school if not beyond.
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:21.200]   If you go back to the late 1800s, 1890, 1900, something like that, before the progression
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.280]   of the progressive movement entered American education system.
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:31.320]   If you go back and you look and study what a student learned in a sixth grade education,
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.840]   it's impressive.
[00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:35.880]   You've often heard people say, well, my grandfather had a sixth grade education.
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.440]   I want to ask, when did he get that sixth grade education?
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:41.940]   Was it in 2020 or was it in 1920?
[00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:47.640]   Because there's a big difference between the sixth grade education of 1900 or 1920 versus
[00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:51.360]   the sixth grade education of 2020.
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:56.280]   So it's my opinion that what used to be taught in five or six years has now been stretched
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.900]   to 12 years.
[00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:03.600]   And what used to be taught in high school has now, for most classes and most subjects,
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.760]   been stretched into college.
[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:10.720]   And then what used to be taught at the undergraduate level in many if not most college degrees
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:14.600]   has now gone to the graduate level.
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:19.720]   So without commenting on whether it's a good thing or a bad thing, I think it just is a
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:21.120]   thing.
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:28.200]   What do you do if you are in charge of guiding an academically competent, intellectually
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.840]   bright student?
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.760]   I think you put them on the fast track.
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:39.880]   And basically, if appropriate, you encourage them to get back to the older, more challenging
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:40.880]   track.
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:48.040]   You move them back onto perhaps a speeded up life phase where they can get ahead a little
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:49.040]   bit quicker.
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:53.440]   There's a big debate, especially in personal financial circles around college and college
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:55.420]   planning.
[00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:57.400]   My opinions lie somewhere in the middle.
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:01.920]   I'm not ready to write off college in favor of YouTube U.
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:05.040]   I think there's a tremendous benefit in having a college degree.
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:09.900]   Assuming that my children are academically inclined, I will encourage my children to
[00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:14.680]   at least finish a bachelor's degree, a college bachelor's degree.
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:21.280]   The reason I think this is important is at the minimum as a backup plan.
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:27.660]   I've become really sensitive to the need for people to have backup plans, for the need
[00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:33.360]   for people to have a fallback option, especially for them to be able to earn a decent wage
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:39.080]   in a career that has specific requirements and that has a good hiring ability.
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:43.840]   One of the things that stymies a lot of people's entrepreneurial ambitions is if they don't
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:48.200]   have something to fall back on where they can quickly and easily get rehired.
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:52.280]   You may have an idea to go out and start a business, but what happens if the business
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:53.280]   fails?
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:54.280]   I think about this a lot.
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:56.200]   What happens if all my businesses fail?
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.200]   What do I do?
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.460]   I have four children to support.
[00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:00.720]   I have a wife to provide for.
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.520]   I have a family to take care of.
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:06.720]   I can't afford to go back and get a job delivering pizzas.
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.320]   I tried that one time.
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.760]   I thought you could make 20 bucks an hour.
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:11.320]   Found out you can't, like nine.
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:13.320]   And I can't support a family on $9 an hour.
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:15.200]   Just cannot do it.
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.320]   And so I need a decent wage.
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.720]   I need a decent professional wage.
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.040]   And so I need to have a backup plan.
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:26.640]   I need to have some kind of industry that I can go back to and get hired quickly.
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:29.920]   Some of the most difficult financial planning situations I've ever been in is when coaching
[00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:32.060]   people who don't have that.
[00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:34.500]   They meandered into the workforce.
[00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:38.040]   They skipped college or took a few classes but didn't graduate.
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:41.000]   They wound up bouncing from one job to another job.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   A lot of times they were single.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   Then they got married.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   Then they had children.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.240]   And all of a sudden, they find themselves unable to live on $20,000 a year.
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:50.160]   And they find that I need to make more.
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:55.000]   Well, in those situations, you can't just go back and Uber helps, right?
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.320]   But it's hard to make a living driving for Uber.
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:00.560]   It's hard to make a living and support a family driving for Amazon.
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:04.320]   It's hard to make a living as a server, right?
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.560]   You need some good skills.
[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:08.760]   You need something significant that you can fall back on.
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:13.400]   Now, in all of those careers, there are specialties.
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:18.600]   And I don't think that that backup plan has to involve academic accreditation, for example.
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:21.440]   Perhaps you have developed a skill of bartending.
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:28.960]   Well, you're going to make a lot more as a skillful high-end bartender than you are as
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:31.060]   an entry-level server.
[00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:35.680]   So something like putting in place bartending skills and being able to toss a bottle with
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:40.280]   the best of them may very well be a reasonable backup plan.
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:48.600]   But I think the old standby backup plans of a degree, a certification, a job specialty
[00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:51.600]   that's in high demand is a really good idea.
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:55.160]   I think of somebody, let's say you've got a nursing degree, right?
[00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:57.000]   A nursing degree is in very high demand.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:03.720]   The nurse who maintains the qualifications, who maintains all of the relevant licenses,
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:07.800]   et cetera, a nurse can be assured of employment in just about any city in the world.
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:10.960]   And then, of course, that employment can be high or low, but at least it can be employment.
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:13.320]   You can support a family on a nursing income.
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:16.040]   I think of somebody like an accountant, right?
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:21.480]   If you're an accountant and you have a current CPA license, you have the ability to go and
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:22.480]   get a job.
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:23.480]   You may not love the job.
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:26.120]   I'm not saying you love it, but at least you have it.
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:29.240]   And so these kinds of backup plans are important.
[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:35.000]   It's important to have a useful, financially valuable skill that could assure you of employment
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   fairly quickly.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.320]   You know, recently I brought all my financial planning certifications back up to date.
[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:45.240]   And as I was thinking about why I did it, the reason I just went out of compliance on
[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:48.040]   my CE, I didn't stay current on my continuing education.
[00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:49.040]   I was traveling.
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:50.360]   I didn't really care.
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:54.860]   I worked really hard to get a certified financial planner designation and a chartered life underwriter
[00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:56.360]   and I have a master's degree in financial planning.
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:59.520]   I worked really hard at some point for those.
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:03.080]   But over the last few years, they've just become relatively unimportant to me.
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:07.040]   Now, you know, I needed them previously because I needed to learn the stuff, but now I know
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:10.320]   the stuff and I know that whether or not I have a CFP after my name doesn't really matter
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:11.320]   to me.
[00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:12.960]   I know the stuff.
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:17.880]   And so I had let them go, but I recently just thought, "That's stupid.
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:20.200]   Let me just go ahead and get them back and do the CE."
[00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:25.180]   And one of my reasons is I want that as a backup plan with a good academic pedigree,
[00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:27.460]   with the experience that I have as a financial planner.
[00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:31.940]   I could move back to any city in the United States and I could have in a week or two,
[00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:36.180]   I could have a six-figure financial planning job at almost any firm.
[00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:40.580]   And what would open the door and separate me from almost any other applicant is the
[00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:43.820]   long string of letters and designations after my name.
[00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:48.140]   That would get me an interview at any financial planning firm in any town in the United States.
[00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:51.700]   And I can't afford not to have that kind of backup plan.
[00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:54.660]   I can't afford not to do that for the good of my family.
[00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:57.520]   I can't afford not to have those options.
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:02.900]   And it puts me in a much stronger position as an entrepreneur to have those options,
[00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:05.900]   which is why you always, even if you're going to start something entrepreneurial that you're
[00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:11.020]   excited about, you want to make sure you don't...
[00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:15.820]   You want to make sure that if you get wiped out, you can still eat.
[00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:20.140]   There's a time and a place to take a risk, but sometimes you wipe out.
[00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:24.940]   And the fact that you have a teaching, a current teaching designation or certification, you
[00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:29.080]   can go and get hired and take a year and just teach and then go ahead and work at nights
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:34.500]   on your dream again while you're getting your feet back under you is really, really important.
[00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:39.560]   There are a lot of entrepreneurs who've gone bankrupt and started afresh, but you start
[00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:42.760]   with a job and you need to maintain that.
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:46.620]   And so for children, I think one of our responsibilities with our children is to help them develop
[00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:47.620]   that.
[00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:51.540]   I think this is where we really fail our children a lot of times because the academics that
[00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:58.180]   we teach them, the stereotypical mainstream path does not help a child very much.
[00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:05.220]   First, a high school degree is of minimal benefit in the job marketplace.
[00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:10.100]   A high school degree at one time had significant benefits in the employment marketplace, but
[00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:14.400]   at this point it might be a barrier to entry to not have one.
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:17.840]   But the possession of a high school degree doesn't mean that much.
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:26.840]   You don't see that many decent jobs, median and upper second quartile jobs saying must
[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:28.280]   possess a high school degree.
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:31.020]   You usually see a college degree.
[00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:37.600]   And so the high school degree doesn't prepare children for the workforce in any really strong
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:38.600]   way.
[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:44.320]   In addition, the college degree in and of itself can be a good way of opening doors,
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:50.160]   but many college degrees don't even prepare people for a decent job.
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:55.880]   General studies degrees, humanities degrees, the proverbial underwater basket weaving degrees,
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:18:00.000]   these types of degrees do not help students.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.400]   I always just feel so bad for somebody who says, "I got an English degree or a gender
[00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:10.800]   studies degree or these general humanities degrees.
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:12.120]   I'm all into the humanities.
[00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:15.840]   I'm all into English."
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:18.280]   But these are the things that open up.
[00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:19.720]   They don't do much for you.
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:21.160]   They're only useful in an academic world.
[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:24.960]   And when you got college enrollments declining, you've got colleges cutting things back, there's
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:30.160]   a major job crunch in the academic marketplace, you don't have much of a choice except to
[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:32.040]   go and get another advanced degree.
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:35.360]   The PhD glut has been real for a long time.
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:39.720]   And so you need to help your child to prepare for something, something where they're actually
[00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:42.720]   going to be demand.
[00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:48.560]   But I do still think that four-year degree is helpful and is necessary.
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:54.720]   So putting these things together, if you want your children to be prepared for the future,
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:19:00.000]   if you want them to have the academic qualifications, and if you all of a sudden find out that your
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:06.080]   children are going to be at your dining table every day, what can you do to help them?
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:13.880]   My recommendation is skip high school, study college.
[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:17.960]   Skip high school, take college instead.
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:21.200]   Here's how you do it.
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:24.600]   You take your student, you map out with them, right?
[00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:29.460]   You need to take into account their interests, but you map out with them a course of study
[00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:35.600]   that's going to allow them to get college credit for as much of their areas of studies
[00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:36.600]   as possible.
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:41.280]   And there are many, many ways to do this.
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:45.600]   Let's start with the basic stuff that most people know, and then I'll tell you how to
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:47.760]   turbocharge this.
[00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:50.160]   When I was in high school, I took a number of AP classes.
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:52.340]   I wish I had taken more.
[00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:55.040]   One of my biggest regrets is that I didn't do this.
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:58.900]   Nobody taught this to me when I was in high school, because I would have crushed this.
[00:19:58.900 --> 00:19:59.940]   But nobody taught this to me.
[00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:02.280]   But I took a number of AP classes.
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:06.960]   For the uninitiated, AP is an acronym for Advanced Placement.
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:12.680]   Advanced Placement classes are classes that are geared towards helping bright students
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:19.960]   who would like to have a little bit more of a challenge to study a subject, to get, in
[00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:24.400]   most schools, a little bit higher GPA for their good grades in that subject, and then
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:28.960]   to prepare them for an exam at the end of the year, and that exam will be accepted by
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:34.900]   most colleges if this exam is passed, accepted by most colleges for college credit.
[00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:41.340]   So for example, I took a handful of classes, but I took an AP English Language and Composition
[00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:43.980]   course.
[00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:48.580]   I could have just taken a standard English course, but I took an AP English course instead.
[00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:50.800]   Then at the end of the year, I sat for the exam.
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:55.060]   It was a few-hour exam, and you get graded on a one to five.
[00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:56.900]   I think I got a five on my English exam.
[00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:02.800]   I took a US History, United States History, AP United States History class.
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:05.700]   So we study history all through the year, and at the end of the year, we take a comprehensive
[00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:07.020]   exam on AP History.
[00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:08.020]   Passed that one.
[00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:10.040]   I took an AP Calculus class.
[00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:11.340]   Took Calculus all through the year.
[00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:15.340]   At the end of the year, I failed that one.
[00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:17.340]   But the ones that I passed gave me college credit.
[00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:23.860]   My college gave me three hours of credit towards my degree for each of the AP classes that
[00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:24.860]   I passed.
[00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:28.500]   Now, in hindsight, there were more AP classes available, but I didn't bother to take them
[00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:31.820]   because nobody laid out for me how important they should be.
[00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:34.300]   I remember that I chose not to take AP Chemistry.
[00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:35.820]   I chose not to take AP Spanish.
[00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:39.900]   I just didn't take them because I didn't really care all that much, and nobody taught me that
[00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:41.600]   they were really important.
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:44.540]   But there are lots and lots of AP classes available.
[00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:46.480]   Your local school, your child's school has them.
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:48.500]   Your child might be enrolled in them.
[00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:53.020]   So the first thing to do is to encourage your children to understand how important and valuable
[00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:58.940]   these are, how extremely important it is that they take these and prepare for the exams
[00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:04.980]   and pass the exams because this will allow them to very quickly get through college,
[00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:09.340]   which will save them money, save you money, and/or allow them to specialize in some more
[00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:10.860]   interesting things.
[00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:15.940]   My wife had so many AP exam credits that she basically had her first year of college done
[00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:20.100]   when she went in, finished her four-year degree in three years, didn't take any extra classes,
[00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:24.340]   got a major and a minor, but took her four-year degree in three years due to AP classes.
[00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:25.740]   And that's relatively easy.
[00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:31.060]   So at the very least, that can cut the expense of college by 25%, which in a world of burgeoning
[00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:36.100]   student debt is particularly helpful and valuable.
[00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:38.260]   Now that's mainstream.
[00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:40.220]   But don't jump over it just because it's mainstream.
[00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:41.220]   It's important.
[00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:45.860]   I want to talk for a moment about academically competent children before we go on.
[00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:50.620]   You'll notice that I use these phrases repeatedly.
[00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:52.060]   Academically bright, right?
[00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:57.100]   Academically oriented, intellectually competent, cognitive with children with a high cognitive
[00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:58.260]   ability.
[00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:04.220]   All of these are ways of basically saying your children are high IQ and they're doing
[00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:05.620]   a good job.
[00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:07.640]   Academics come easily to them.
[00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:16.080]   If your child does not fit that description, then I think as a parent, it's your responsibility
[00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:19.320]   to help them find something that does come easily to them.
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:24.720]   In my opinion, one of the biggest problems with the one size fits all, colleges for all
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:32.960]   approach is we often try to shoehorn children who are not academically gifted.
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:37.560]   We try to shoehorn children who are not, don't have a high cognitive ability into careers
[00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:39.520]   where they get frustrated.
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:45.400]   When you look at college graduation rates, what you find is there are a lot of students
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:47.560]   who graduate from college.
[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:51.040]   But the people, and they go, they graduate, they come out of the other side with a degree.
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:54.360]   Yeah, they got some student loan debt in most cases, but it's not that big a deal, right?
[00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:58.840]   They get a job, they pay it back, not that big a deal.
[00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:03.000]   The people who really get hurt are the people who have pushed into academically oriented
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:08.320]   tracks, but whose brains don't work that way.
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:12.800]   They go to school for three years, they pay crazy amounts of money.
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:16.280]   They don't have any scholarships because they didn't have good grades in high school, but
[00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:20.240]   yet they're told you got to go to college, you got to go to college, and then they drop
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:21.240]   out.
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:25.720]   And now they've got $40,000 of debt and no degree.
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:29.040]   Those people should not go to college.
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:32.960]   College is for people for whom academics come easily to them.
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:37.120]   If academics don't come easily to you, if academics don't come easily to your child,
[00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:41.500]   go do something that comes easily to you.
[00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:45.120]   And you'll make a lot more money and be a lot more successful and be a lot more successful
[00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:46.120]   faster.
[00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:47.120]   Right?
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:48.720]   I am not skilled with my hands.
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:51.800]   When I work with my hands, I feel like an idiot.
[00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:56.880]   I feel completely incompetent in the majority of tasks.
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:58.120]   Not true.
[00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:01.080]   I don't feel like it comes easily to me because I think it's important.
[00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:06.320]   I've tried to gain some basic skill, but it just doesn't work.
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:10.760]   Whereas for me, academic subjects are the easiest thing in the world.
[00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:13.200]   My brain works that way.
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:17.320]   Very good friend of mine from childhood, he's the exact opposite.
[00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:22.240]   Academics don't come to him, but when I watch him work with his hands, it's like he sees
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:24.840]   things in 3D, but physical things.
[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:26.520]   He's incredibly competent.
[00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:28.080]   He's so gifted.
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:33.160]   And he makes a six-figure plus income as an electrician.
[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:34.780]   He's really good.
[00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:36.440]   And he's got kind of that good mix.
[00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:40.280]   I've known guys that made six-figure incomes as welders.
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:42.880]   I've known guys that built huge businesses.
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:47.280]   So you don't need academics to become financially successful.
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:53.120]   And if you'll set your child whose skill set is not in academics free from the chains of
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:58.640]   an academically oriented society, what they'll find is tremendous opportunity in other areas.
[00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:01.960]   So that's a separate show of how to steer those children.
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:07.040]   But if you have a child who's academically oriented, taking classes, learning, and taking
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:09.640]   tests is not that big a deal.
[00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:12.520]   Requires discipline, but it's not that big a deal.
[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:17.360]   In hindsight, the reason I failed my calculus exam, for example, was I didn't do the homework.
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:18.840]   Nobody came along and made sure I did the homework.
[00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:19.840]   I didn't know what I was talking about.
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:22.520]   I never, I just didn't pay attention in the class.
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:23.520]   And that's why I failed.
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:25.480]   It wasn't because I was not competent and I couldn't have learned.
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:27.600]   It was because nobody required me to learn it.
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:28.840]   The teacher let me slack off.
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:32.800]   My parents let me slack off and I failed the exam.
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:43.040]   AP classes though, in a standard school environment can give everything that your child needs
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:45.960]   to quiz out of their first year of college.
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:49.920]   Now you say, okay, fine, but here's the secret.
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:56.600]   Did you know that you don't need to be enrolled in an AP class to take an AP exam?
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:58.320]   Let me tell you about some of the AP exams that are available.
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:26:59.400]   I'm going to read you the list.
[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:01.520]   Let's start with arts.
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:06.900]   There is a 2D art and design class, also a 3D art and design class.
[00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:09.620]   There is an art history class available.
[00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:16.480]   There is an AP drawing exam, sorry, these are exams, and an AP music theory exam.
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:22.120]   Depending on the exact college requirements, your child, if your child is artistically
[00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:31.980]   oriented, there is 3, 6, 12, 15, 18 credit hours, possibly more of college credit available
[00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:34.240]   for passing those AP exams.
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:37.640]   18 credit hours is your child's first semester.
[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:41.620]   And your artistically oriented child would probably really enjoy that.
[00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:45.820]   Next English, AP English language and composition, AP English literature and composition.
[00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:47.400]   Your child likes to read.
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:49.600]   There's six plus hours of credit available.
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:54.000]   The reason I say plus is that every school says what they'll accept.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   Three is about the standard for these.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.760]   If your child gets a three, a four, or a five on the AP exam, they'll probably get three
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:02.020]   hours of college credit.
[00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:06.220]   Some colleges will give more than three hours, so it's possibly more.
[00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:07.880]   What about history and social sciences?
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:10.480]   Well, here are the AP exams that are available.
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:16.120]   Comparative government and politics, European history, human geography, macroeconomics,
[00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:21.360]   microeconomics, psychology, United States government and politics, United States history,
[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:22.360]   world history, modern.
[00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:32.040]   There are 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27 hours of potential history and social science
[00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:33.040]   credits.
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:35.360]   Huge, hugely powerful.
[00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:41.400]   Next math and computer science, AP calculus AB, AP calculus BC, AP computer science A,
[00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:44.040]   and AP computer science principles and AP statistics.
[00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:48.120]   For your mathematically oriented children, huge number of math credits available.
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:55.720]   Sciences, AP biology, AP chemistry, AP environmental science, AP physics one and two, algebra based,
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:29:00.360]   AP physics C, electricity and magnetism, and AP physics C mechanics.
[00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:02.200]   Tons of science credits available there.
[00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:06.520]   AP world languages and cultures, there's an AP Chinese language and culture, AP French
[00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:10.880]   language and culture, AP German, Italian, Japanese, Spanish language and culture, also
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:13.480]   Spanish literature and culture, and Latin.
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:18.440]   So if your child is studying Latin, go ahead and pass the AP Latin exam and get the college
[00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:19.440]   credit.
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:23.360]   There are something like 38, I didn't count these fresh here, but almost 40 different
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:24.680]   credits that your child can take.
[00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:26.200]   But here's the secret.
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:30.920]   Your child might be enrolled currently in AP, there's no AP chem, yeah, AP chemistry,
[00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:33.560]   or AP calculus, great.
[00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:37.280]   But they can take the rest of the AP exams and they don't have to be enrolled in the
[00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:39.280]   course.
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:42.400]   And the AP, the AP is done by the college board.
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:47.360]   The college board is actually providing right now free online courses for AP classes.
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:52.120]   So if your child is at home, they're already taking school online, go ahead and have them
[00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:56.440]   take these AP classes and pass the exam at the end of the year.
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:30:00.080]   The courses are being taught online for free by the college board.
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:02.160]   There are also tons of courses available.
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:04.520]   I was recently looking at a math curriculum.
[00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:08.080]   My wife and I were talking about what we're going to do for this next year for our children's
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:09.680]   math curricula.
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:18.040]   And as we were discussing it, there's a math program that I admire and I was looking at
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:19.040]   the requirements.
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:25.000]   So they've got all of the math, algebra, they've got, which get to the algebra test in this
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.440]   moment, they've got algebra, they've got calculus, and then they got AP physics, AP chemistry,
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:30.920]   everything is there with one math curriculum.
[00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:34.080]   And the price of the course is a hundred and something dollars.
[00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:35.480]   The teacher is awesome.
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:39.040]   Everything is video based and it's a homeschool course, totally available.
[00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:42.400]   And so if your child, even if your child is still enrolled in the local government school
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:46.280]   or something like that, you can just sign them up for the homeschool course.
[00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:49.360]   Easier if you just pull them out of the local school, but it's all right there.
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:50.560]   And that's the power.
[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:52.800]   Now why don't most parents do this?
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:56.240]   Most parents don't do this because their child is enrolled in a traditional school, local
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:00.760]   private school, local government school, and they want their child to be there with their
[00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:01.760]   friends.
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:02.840]   They've already got eight classes there.
[00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:03.840]   They've got too much homework.
[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:05.640]   How can you add more on top of that?
[00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:09.880]   But if your child already can't go there, if they have to do school online anyway, why
[00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:16.240]   not unenroll them from all the dumb stuff and enroll them in AP classes?
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:21.400]   For an academically bright student, you buy them an AP manual, a review manual, say, "Read
[00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:24.280]   this book, take this test."
[00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:29.720]   I'll get to this more when I talk about CLEP in just a moment, but my basic assumption,
[00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:35.960]   assuming that my children are academically competent for their high school career, again,
[00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:41.960]   all of this open to proper judgment of a parent, adjusting to the unique nature of his children.
[00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:46.360]   But for my children in high school career, what I basically plan to do is to say, "Here's
[00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:47.920]   a book.
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:51.640]   Read this book, learn it, take this exam."
[00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:52.720]   We don't do in our homeschool.
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:53.960]   We don't do any tests.
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:54.960]   We don't do any quizzes.
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:56.600]   We don't do any of that junk.
[00:31:56.600 --> 00:32:00.960]   We just learn and we do the work every day.
[00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:02.600]   I would do the same thing in high school.
[00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:05.720]   Here's the book, learn this, pass it.
[00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:10.160]   Here's the book on United States government and politics, learn this textbook, pass it.
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:11.160]   Now I'm good at that.
[00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:12.880]   That's what I've done with all my master's degree.
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:13.880]   I did the entire thing.
[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:14.880]   I have a master's degree in financial planning.
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:17.720]   The entire thing was ship me a textbook or two or three.
[00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:18.720]   I read the textbook.
[00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:19.720]   I take a test.
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:21.440]   That was it.
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:26.160]   Did that, I don't know, a dozen or two times and wound up with a master's degree.
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:27.400]   And that's the power of it.
[00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:34.320]   But again, that's why I try to give you the caution on you have to make sure your child
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:35.400]   is academically inclined.
[00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:37.360]   To me, I thrive in this environment.
[00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:38.600]   Your child might thrive in this environment.
[00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:42.920]   I would have thrived in this environment as a high school student.
[00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:43.920]   Your child may not.
[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:45.200]   So just for that.
[00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:46.880]   But there's 30-something courses.
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:53.200]   And even if your child is not enrolled in an AP class, they can still take an AP exam.
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:55.240]   Anybody can take an AP exam.
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:33:01.060]   Now the limitation of the AP exam is they're offered once per year, May generally.
[00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:02.960]   And so you have to take them all at one time.
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:07.280]   So that can be a very tiring week if you're taking five AP exams or 10 AP exams, but you
[00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:08.460]   can take them.
[00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:10.600]   And there's no limit on the number of them that you can take.
[00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:15.360]   You just simply have to arrange it and do them all during May of that year.
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:18.000]   Now at the moment, it's my understanding though, that they're administering these exams at
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.600]   home, which is a totally separate opportunity.
[00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:23.240]   Where now you don't even necessarily have to go into the school, but we'll see what
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:25.640]   happens in May of 2021.
[00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:27.560]   Now what comes next?
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:29.640]   Well next we come to CLEP exams.
[00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:36.320]   CLEP exams are college level examination programs, which are given basically the same rating
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:39.840]   or weight as AP exams.
[00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:43.920]   If you pass the CLEP exam at the appropriate level required by the school, generally 50
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:47.360]   points, sometimes a little bit higher, depending on the school, your school will give you a
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:48.520]   certain amount of credit.
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:51.040]   Let me go through some of the options that are available here.
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:55.160]   CLEP exams, composition, and actually before I do it, let me, let me notate this for you.
[00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:58.920]   The neat thing about CLEP exams is CLEP exams are available to anybody.
[00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:01.580]   Can be a child, can be an adult.
[00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:06.760]   So if you as an adult wish to finish a four-year college degree, a bachelor's degree, this
[00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:08.840]   is your ticket to getting college credit quickly.
[00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:13.560]   If you can do this, if you can sit, read a book, take an online class, right?
[00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:14.960]   You can use a teacher.
[00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:18.200]   You can give your children teachers if they need teachers, give them an online class.
[00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:20.680]   If there are things that they need the teacher's input, great.
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:24.680]   If it can't be learned well from the book, give them the teacher and have them do that.
[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:29.000]   But the CLEP exams can be taken by anybody and CLEP exams can be taken around the clock.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.360]   They don't have to be taken at any particular time of the year.
[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:33.400]   So let's go over the current CLEP exams.
[00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:35.840]   First, composition and literature.
[00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:37.680]   American literature.
[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:39.920]   Analyzing and interpreting literature.
[00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:41.000]   College composition.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.880]   College composition modular.
[00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:44.880]   English literature and humanities.
[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:51.800]   There are six courses where if your student passes those exams, which I don't know, I've
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.480]   always found that stuff pretty easy.
[00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:54.540]   Some people don't.
[00:34:54.540 --> 00:35:00.840]   But if your student passes those exams, there are potentially 18 credit hours of work.
[00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:03.280]   Now here is what's interesting.
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:05.520]   If you're going to take an exam on American literature, let's say you're going to take
[00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:08.640]   a ninth grade English class, right?
[00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:12.680]   Most of us took in ninth grade some kind of English class.
[00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:18.000]   But all you got for that at the end of the year was ninth grade English credit.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:23.840]   Why not just simply adjust your ninth grade English class to adjust, to fit the needs
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:25.560]   for this college composition exam?
[00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:29.080]   I know it says college, but come on, give me a break.
[00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:33.480]   Bright ninth grader with practice, very well do this.
[00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:34.600]   English literature.
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:39.400]   Why not just simply adjust your 10th grade class to the syllabus and the things that
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:42.160]   are going to be tested in this English literature exam?
[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:45.760]   In a homeschool, you have all this as a possibility.
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:52.040]   So you adjust your curriculum to these CLEP exams and you map the courses to the exams
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:58.320]   and your child's final test at the end of the study period is pass this exam.
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:03.280]   Now if you had given Joshua, the 10th grader, this as an option, and you told Joshua, "Here,
[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:07.240]   your job is just study this and then test the exam.
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:08.920]   And whenever you're ready, let me know."
[00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:11.520]   And some of those I could do in two weeks, some of those I could do in two months.
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:13.880]   One of them might take me two years, who knows?
[00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:19.120]   Now we've got the ultimate in broad-based education, getting college credit, and it's
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:21.000]   just at the pace of the student.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.360]   Study, take the exam.
[00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:23.360]   Let's continue.
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:28.600]   World languages, French language, German language, Spanish language, and Spanish with writing.
[00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:30.320]   Four different exams there.
[00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:34.680]   History and social sciences, American government, history of the United States one and history
[00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:36.160]   of the United States two.
[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:37.160]   I mean, pause.
[00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:43.160]   If you're going to take a history class, why not just map the content of the history class
[00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:49.840]   to the CLEP exam and make sure that component, one of your history texts as you're hammering
[00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:55.120]   home the real point of history that really needs to be learned using your living books,
[00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:59.640]   using your primary sources, using your, you know, whatever professor you're going to use,
[00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:03.640]   just map that and then have the capstone requirement of that course for your ninth grader, your
[00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:11.600]   tenth grader be, read this CLEP exam review book of the history of the United States,
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:17.160]   read this book, take these practice tests and go past this exam.
[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:23.920]   I'm not, I appreciate that this can be challenging for many students, but for a bright student
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:26.320]   or for a disciplined student, this is very doable.
[00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:27.600]   There are lots of students that are doing it.
[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:34.160]   And there's no real difference in academic ability between a disciplined and mature tenth
[00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:38.720]   grader or a disciplined and mature 15 year old and a disciplined and mature 20 year old.
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:43.480]   There's nothing magically that happens at the age of 18 where somebody's academic levels
[00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:44.480]   come up.
[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:48.660]   And so if you can instill discipline and character in your children such that they can do this
[00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:52.080]   and put an orderly environment in place where they're expected to study and expected to
[00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:56.960]   do it, you can basically skip college with this path.
[00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:00.000]   Continuing on, human growth and development.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.560]   Your child needs to understand about the human body and growth and development, map their
[00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:06.480]   content to the CLEP exam.
[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:10.600]   Introduction to educational psychology, introduction to psychology, introductory sociology.
[00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:15.480]   Don't you think that most of us should study a little bit about psychology and understand
[00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:16.480]   at least the basics?
[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:19.200]   Wouldn't that be important?
[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:24.760]   Principles of macroeconomics, principles of microeconomics, social sciences and history,
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:29.200]   western civilization one, ancient near east to 1648, western civilization two, 1648 to
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:30.960]   the present.
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:37.940]   Most of that, a good history curriculum could knock out your western civ one and two and
[00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:42.880]   history of the United States one and two with CLEP exams at the end of the course of study.
[00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:44.080]   Science and mathematics.
[00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:45.160]   Here's what's interesting.
[00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:46.160]   First biology.
[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:51.480]   If your child's going to take a high school biology class, just map it to the, map the
[00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:56.680]   requirements to the CLEP exam and have them read the CLEP review book for their biology
[00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:58.640]   book and at the end of it take the exam.
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:01.320]   I'm going to change the order here.
[00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:04.920]   There's college mathematics is a CLEP exam.
[00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:08.360]   Now college mathematics is interesting but it's a lot of arithmetics, not algebra, a
[00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:11.360]   lot of arithmetic.
[00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:17.760]   Your child who's taking math, who's good at math can read the prep book, pass the exam.
[00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:19.440]   Next college algebra.
[00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:24.080]   Why not finish your algebra class and have the capstone requirement of your high school
[00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:27.440]   algebra class take the college algebra CLEP exam?
[00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:31.360]   There's not that big of a difference between, I mean there's a good, high school algebra
[00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:33.480]   class is the same as a good college algebra class.
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:36.960]   We're not talking about differential equations here, it's algebra.
[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:41.760]   Next chemistry, calculus, natural sciences and pre-calculus.
[00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:46.480]   So right there if you've got college mathematics, college algebra, pre-calculus and calculus,
[00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:52.040]   if you map your high school students study to those four exams, they take the class,
[00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:57.460]   take the math curriculum, build the skills, read the review book, practice the exercises,
[00:39:57.460 --> 00:40:02.160]   take the pre-test and then take the exam, you now have with those four classes you now
[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:06.240]   have 12 credits, 12 college credits.
[00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:12.960]   And then business, financial accounting, information systems, introductory business law, principles
[00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:15.720]   of management, principles of marketing.
[00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:24.240]   Again total potential of 15 credit hours if they pass all those CLEP exams.
[00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:26.040]   That's a lot of potential credit hours.
[00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:32.000]   We're now going to pivot to the third program, less known, not quite as widely available
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.200]   but still perfectly applicable.
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:40.240]   The DSST exams, Department of Military exams, the Dante exams.
[00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:44.240]   I'm going to read fast but listen to these titles of exams.
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:49.760]   The nice thing about the DSST exams also often accepted for college credit by many colleges,
[00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:53.720]   also often accepted for college credit but these are a little bit more granular in nature.
[00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:55.900]   They focus on more subject matter.
[00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:59.040]   And so your child can often, they can prepare for these, right?
[00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:02.700]   Study.com has a lot of great resources for DSST classes.
[00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:08.120]   They can prepare for these exams and they can take them and they're smaller chunks than
[00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:10.200]   the AP US History exam.
[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:11.200]   So let's cover them.
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:16.360]   Forgive the thunderstorm outside my window.
[00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:19.360]   Sorry about that.
[00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:25.960]   Continuing on, the business courses for DSST, business ethics and society, business mathematics.
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:29.960]   Now pause for a moment here.
[00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:35.920]   You want your child to understand business mathematics, right?
[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:37.440]   That's basic knowledge.
[00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:38.780]   That's mathematics 101.
[00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:41.600]   That's every business owner needs to understand business mathematics.
[00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:45.400]   This is not difficult stuff for those who are academically inclined.
[00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:47.360]   It's not hard.
[00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:52.240]   So have your child take the DSST exam and pass the DSST exam and now we've got some
[00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:54.520]   real benefits for their math studies.
[00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:57.800]   Instead of just saying, yes, you took ninth grade math, 10th grade math, 11th grade math,
[00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:01.000]   12th grade math, have them take business mathematics.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.720]   It's going to be much more practical than ninth grade math.
[00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:09.540]   Business ethics and society, business mathematics, human resource management, introduction to
[00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:17.280]   business, management information systems, organizational behavior, money and banking.
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:18.280]   Personal finance class, right?
[00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:21.420]   We say we want to teach our children personal finance, have them take the DSST exam for
[00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:23.100]   money and banking.
[00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:26.820]   Personal finance, take the personal finance exam.
[00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:29.700]   Principles of finance, principles of supervision.
[00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:36.840]   Now the humanities, ethics in America, introduction to world religions, principles of public speaking,
[00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:42.100]   principles of advanced English, composition, math, fundamentals of college algebra, principles
[00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:49.460]   of statistics, math for liberal arts, physical science, astronomy, environmental science,
[00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:54.440]   health and development, principles of physical science one and introduction to geology.
[00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:55.440]   Social sciences, how about this?
[00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:58.220]   A history of the Vietnam War.
[00:42:58.220 --> 00:43:02.660]   I think that'd be super interesting, but take the class, get the college credit for it.
[00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:03.660]   Take the exam.
[00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:07.260]   Art of the Western world, criminal justice, foundations of education, fundamentals of
[00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:12.900]   counseling, general anthropology, introduction to geography, introduction to law enforcement,
[00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:18.060]   lifespan developmental psychology, history of the Soviet Union, substance abuse, the
[00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:22.380]   Civil War and reconstruction, and then technology, fundamentals of cybersecurity and technical
[00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:24.480]   writing ethics and technology.
[00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:26.060]   So now to your high school student, right?
[00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:31.580]   Why not go ahead and have them take the substance abuse class as part of their general understanding
[00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:36.420]   of the dangers of substance abuse and get some college credit for it.
[00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:38.500]   There are other options for education.
[00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:41.820]   I'm, for example, ignoring GRE subject matter exams.
[00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:44.340]   I'm ignoring dual enrollment, right?
[00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:47.740]   Your child could always just enroll in a local community college.
[00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:49.060]   There are many options.
[00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:51.900]   I'm just talking about taking exams.
[00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:57.140]   These are three broad sets of exams that you can simply take.
[00:43:57.140 --> 00:44:04.260]   Now conceivably, there's the limit as to the number of college credits that your child
[00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:07.220]   could get here is pretty high.
[00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:11.100]   If there is something like 35 exams available for each of these, in theory, if the child
[00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:15.580]   took all of them, that'd be 105 exams, which in theory would be 315 credit hours.
[00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:19.300]   Now we'll talk about the limitations of this, but so that you understand the American college
[00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:24.060]   system, in the American college system, a four-year bachelor's degree basically requires
[00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:29.380]   a student to complete 120 credit hours of instruction.
[00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:35.460]   A credit hour is considered to be one hour per week of class during the course of a,
[00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:36.820]   what is it, a 16-week semester?
[00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:41.220]   I don't remember, 12-week, 14-week, something like that, a semester.
[00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:45.740]   And so in the course of that semester, if you have a three credit hour class, you have
[00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:47.360]   class for three hours a week.
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:50.000]   Sometimes that's Monday, Wednesday, Friday, sometimes it's Tuesday and Thursday, sometimes
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.940]   three hours on Saturday, depending on how the college is set up.
[00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:58.440]   And the average full-time credit load is considered to be 12 hours up to 18 hours.
[00:44:58.440 --> 00:44:59.920]   Of course, you can take more.
[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:05.880]   I don't think I ever took more than 18, but I did take 18 some hours, as little as 12
[00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:07.000]   one semester.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:10.080]   And so that's 12 hours in a week up to 18 hours in a week.
[00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:18.240]   Trust me, doing this on your own is far more efficient from a time perspective.
[00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:21.420]   And it's just a tremendous opportunity.
[00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:23.520]   From a financial perspective, what do these things cost?
[00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:27.520]   Well, every CLEP exam costs you, I think it's like about 90 bucks.
[00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:30.360]   AP exams cost you something in the range of 100 bucks.
[00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:32.600]   Let's just figure 100 bucks each.
[00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:39.560]   100 bucks for three credit hours of class is a tremendous steal of a deal.
[00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:43.320]   You'll probably also need to pick up a couple of books, some review books.
[00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:47.480]   Of course, you'll need textbooks.
[00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:48.480]   Those vary in cost.
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:52.880]   You might need to enroll your child in a course, but this is nothing like the tuition costs
[00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:55.680]   that most colleges are giving.
[00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:59.320]   So there are plenty of options available here for college credit.
[00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:02.060]   Now, back to the opportunity of coronavirus.
[00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:03.060]   Why don't people do this more?
[00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:05.360]   Well, they say, "I need the benefit of being on campus."
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:08.340]   Well, you're not on campus right now anyway.
[00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:11.520]   If you're a college student listening to me, you're not on campus right now anyway.
[00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:14.740]   So why don't you just go ahead and take some of these exams yourself if you don't have
[00:46:14.740 --> 00:46:21.760]   a full slot of transfer credits by exam for your university and speed your way up?
[00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:24.740]   If your high school student is not in class anyway, just have them do this.
[00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:28.440]   If you're sitting at home taking classes online, what's the difference if you take classes
[00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:30.920]   online and then take the exam or not?
[00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:32.320]   Just do it.
[00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:33.320]   You don't need to be enrolled.
[00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:34.320]   Take the exam.
[00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:37.000]   This is a fast way to get a lot of college credits.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:38.740]   Now what's the limiting factor here?
[00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:45.580]   What you need to understand is that of those 120 credit hours, most colleges limit the
[00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:50.720]   number of transfer credits that they will accept and they limit the number of credits
[00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:52.960]   by examination that they will accept.
[00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:59.000]   So if you go to the local state university, that state university says, "We think that
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:03.360]   the only – if we're going to give you a degree, then that degree needs to indicate
[00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:06.560]   that we've had control of the quality of your education because we have to protect
[00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:12.160]   the quality of our product," which means that we're going to require you to take 60
[00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:16.280]   or 90 hours of instruction here on our campus.
[00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:17.840]   Totally fine to do that.
[00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:19.440]   That's within their rights.
[00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:23.880]   Some prestigious universities – most universities will accept something.
[00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:27.640]   You go to the most prestigious university and you took all your AP exams, they'll usually
[00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:29.100]   give you some credit.
[00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:32.800]   But most won't give you more than 30 hours of credit.
[00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:35.240]   Certainly most won't give you more than 60 hours of credit.
[00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:36.960]   Here's where the opportunity is.
[00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:41.200]   There are a handful of universities that will give you more credit.
[00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:42.200]   There are a handful of them.
[00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:43.960]   They're discussed online.
[00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:45.200]   There's a few of them.
[00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:50.360]   You can – I'm just trying to decide whether to name names or not.
[00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:51.360]   I'll name one.
[00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:54.400]   One of the most popular ones is Thomas Edison State University.
[00:47:54.400 --> 00:48:00.040]   Thomas Edison State University, speaking broadly, does not limit the number of transfer credits
[00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:01.240]   they'll accept.
[00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:08.600]   So it's possible to go into a college such as Thomas Edison State University and possibly
[00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:11.360]   come in with 80 or 90 or 100 credits.
[00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:13.000]   I think they might limit it at 90.
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.160]   But you'll come in with a lot of credit hours.
[00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:17.200]   Now they will require some of the courses online.
[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:21.200]   You won't be able to get a degree in a certain subject without taking more courses than is
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:22.200]   required.
[00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:23.200]   In a moment I'll talk to you about accounting.
[00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:26.040]   But for example, you're not going to get an accounting degree unless you take some
[00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:27.440]   upper level accounting.
[00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:32.700]   You can quiz out of possibly some of your lower information if you take the DSST exam
[00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:37.140]   on business or on financial accounting – sorry, the CLEP exam on financial accounting.
[00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:38.560]   That could help you to quiz out.
[00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:40.560]   That's great of the introductory one.
[00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:44.000]   But you're still going to have to take your advanced managerial, et cetera, accounting.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:50.680]   So if you choose a school that will give you credit for those exams, you now have an interesting
[00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:51.680]   opportunity.
[00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:52.680]   I want to talk about Thomas Edison.
[00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:56.120]   Thomas Edison, one of the more popular, a handful of others that you can look into.
[00:48:56.120 --> 00:49:02.480]   But Thomas Edison is very popular because they allow you to take these courses.
[00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:06.280]   But what they also do is they do online classes for the rest of their classes.
[00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:12.040]   They have extremely reasonable tuition.
[00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:16.200]   So if you're going to take classes anyway and you're going to take all your classes
[00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:23.160]   online anyway, now all of a sudden the disadvantage of taking all virtual classes at Thomas Edison
[00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:32.240]   State University versus your local prestigious state university starts to disappear.
[00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:38.980]   So you transfer into Thomas Edison with 90 credit hours of examination by – of credit
[00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:40.480]   by examination.
[00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:45.220]   And then you go ahead and do another 30 credit hours with them towards a degree.
[00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:49.520]   You got to map your credits, of course, to a degree because they're an accredited university.
[00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:52.160]   They're going to make sure – they got to make sure that they – you satisfy their
[00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:55.320]   degree program so you got to map all your stuff out properly.
[00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:57.480]   But now you have one year.
[00:49:57.480 --> 00:49:58.480]   But here's the thing.
[00:49:58.480 --> 00:49:59.480]   These are online classes.
[00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:02.040]   And so if you've got time, you can do these fast.
[00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:03.040]   You can do these very, very fast.
[00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:05.800]   Now, there are a bunch of other classes out there.
[00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:07.920]   I've got tons of archives of this stuff.
[00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:09.920]   I should put it into a course at some point.
[00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:13.040]   But that's the basic concept.
[00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:17.160]   Quiz out of a bunch of stuff by just simply studying it, taking the exam.
[00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:18.540]   Study, take the exam.
[00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:26.600]   And then finish off at a university that will give you a huge amount of credit for a degree
[00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:30.360]   by examination and then go ahead and take your final courses there.
[00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:33.280]   And you can do this for a few thousands of dollars.
[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:35.480]   Now let me give you an example.
[00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:38.140]   This doesn't, by the way, only apply to undergraduate studies.
[00:50:38.140 --> 00:50:40.360]   You can also do this for graduate studies.
[00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:44.560]   And I've talked over the years about my interest in accounting.
[00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:47.160]   I'm interested in accounting personally for obvious reasons, right?
[00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:49.680]   I'm a financial advisor.
[00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:55.120]   But I've often thought that accounting is one of those really nice careers.
[00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:56.440]   Some accountants really love their work.
[00:50:56.440 --> 00:50:57.960]   Some accountants don't.
[00:50:57.960 --> 00:51:02.160]   But accounting is one of those really useful practical skills to develop.
[00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:03.720]   Let me explain why.
[00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:09.040]   And this is, if I have a student who's mathematically oriented, this is the kind of advice that I
[00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:11.080]   would give my high school student.
[00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:12.880]   This would be bad for someone who just hates numbers.
[00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:17.060]   But for someone who's competent with numbers, this would be a perfectly good thing.
[00:51:17.060 --> 00:51:19.200]   Accounting is a career that is in demand.
[00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:22.920]   The only time that the demand for accounting is going to go away is if you go into a hyperinflationary
[00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:24.200]   world.
[00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:26.460]   In Venezuela right now, there are no accountants.
[00:51:26.460 --> 00:51:31.400]   All the accountants that previously were accountants, their business disappeared, and they are all
[00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:33.800]   farmers now or gardeners.
[00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:39.160]   Because it's impossible to do accounting in a hyperinflated currency.
[00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:41.280]   Just there's no way to do it.
[00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:45.280]   And what's interesting is even the whole concept of bookkeeping and accounting disappears when
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:50.240]   you're dealing with, because you're dealing with physical stuff, physical trade.
[00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:54.760]   If you're dealing with money at all, you're dealing with a backpack full of taped together
[00:51:54.760 --> 00:51:57.760]   bundles of useless bank notes.
[00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:00.680]   And so the whole concept of accounting just goes out the window.
[00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:03.680]   Absent that though, accounting is one of those professions that's in demand.
[00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:06.440]   You need accounting to make good business decisions.
[00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:09.240]   You need tax accountants who are going to prepare tax returns.
[00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:11.500]   Taxes are not going to become less complex.
[00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:13.360]   And so it's one of those things that's in demand.
[00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:17.000]   I think that accounting is a really good industry.
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:18.000]   It's a seasonal industry.
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:22.160]   It comes with a lot of work if you work for a big accounting firm, but it's a seasonal
[00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:23.160]   industry.
[00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:24.240]   It's an area of expertise.
[00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:25.520]   Not a lot of people are suited for it.
[00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:26.520]   Some people are.
[00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:31.560]   I've often looked at accounting as a really ideal kind of seasonal employment.
[00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:38.320]   If somebody is a seasonal tax preparer and they want to live that kind of seasonal employment
[00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:42.000]   lifestyle where they work six months, they're off for six months, et cetera, you can do
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:43.000]   that as an accountant.
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:46.920]   You can earn a reasonable wage in your months of work and you can take the other months
[00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:51.040]   off, go hang out in your RV in Mexico, that kind of thing.
[00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:53.440]   But accounting has significant licensing requirements.
[00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:55.920]   And so you have to have education requirements.
[00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:57.620]   You have to have licensing requirements.
[00:52:57.620 --> 00:53:03.580]   And as with any licensing scheme, that is a cartel that restricts the flow of people
[00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:04.580]   into it.
[00:53:04.580 --> 00:53:07.640]   So if you want to get into it, you've got to pass all of those licensing requirements.
[00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:14.120]   That means that the cartel can impose artificially high wages because there is a barrier of entry.
[00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:17.920]   So once you're part of that cartel, once you're part of there, you have a little bit of protection
[00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:20.000]   for your industry.
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:23.400]   But accounting is also one of those things that you don't need to be a certain age.
[00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:25.280]   There are young accountants, there are old accountants.
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:31.320]   And so let's say that you give me Joshua's hypothetical 14-year-old.
[00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:35.920]   And my hypothetical 14-year-old is interested in a lot of different things, probably going
[00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:41.440]   to do some kind of entrepreneurship or some kind of passion project or some kind of business
[00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:43.040]   that they're really into.
[00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:47.440]   But they understand that, "Hey, Joshua, just going to prepare me for a career.
[00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:49.240]   And I'm going to have a backup plan."
[00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:51.680]   So we work them through their high school curriculum, right?
[00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:54.020]   You want your children to have a well-rounded education.
[00:53:54.020 --> 00:53:58.920]   But what you do is you map their classes to these CLEP exams.
[00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:02.480]   And the deal that I would make with my student is this.
[00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:06.680]   Listen, if you want to get this stuff done fast, I've always been motivated by get this
[00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:07.680]   stuff done fast.
[00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:10.920]   If you want to get this stuff done fast, pass this exam.
[00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:15.080]   So let's say that you're not that into science, but I, as your father, believe that you need
[00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:18.200]   to know something about basic science.
[00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:19.480]   Great.
[00:54:19.480 --> 00:54:25.080]   Here is a biology textbook, and we'll sign you up for the biology CLEP exam.
[00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:27.400]   You read this textbook, you pass the exam.
[00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:32.520]   You can do it as fast or as slow as you want, but you're required to pass this exam.
[00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:35.760]   Some students give them the textbook, two weeks later, the textbook is read.
[00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:38.880]   They've memorized what they needed to memorize for the exam, pass the exam.
[00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:43.000]   They now proceed to forget everything about biology that they don't need for the rest
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.160]   of their life.
[00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:46.880]   Supplement that with, here's a psychology, right?
[00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:51.960]   You want to study psychology, pass this psychology CLEP exam, pass this AP chemistry exam.
[00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:55.200]   And now we've got everything mapped to them.
[00:54:55.200 --> 00:55:00.120]   Once they have a significant number of credits with broad credits, hopefully mapped to a
[00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:05.680]   degree so that we're not just taking every CLEP exam and every AP exam just because we
[00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:08.120]   can, we're going to map this to a degree.
[00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:13.080]   Then we go ahead and enroll them at something like Thomas Edison State University.
[00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:18.200]   So in this case, I would actually enroll them in the business degree that they offer there.
[00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:23.360]   Now I'm focusing on an example for accounting, but Thomas Edison University offers a Bachelor
[00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:31.080]   of Science in Business Administration with a specialization in accounting and CPA and
[00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:33.480]   certified public accountant specialization.
[00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:36.240]   And so let me just read you, for example, from their website.
[00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:39.680]   The Bachelor of Science in Business Administration and Accounting Certified Public Accountant
[00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:43.720]   Specialization is designed specifically for accounting students interested in pursuing
[00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:45.280]   CPA certification.
[00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:49.880]   The program ensures college level competence of financial, managerial, and cost accounting,
[00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:54.000]   analyzing performance and auditing, as well as the principles of finance, business, and
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.520]   the arts and sciences.
[00:55:55.520 --> 00:56:00.360]   The BS/BA in accounting/CPA will provide CPA bound students with the prerequisites required
[00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:03.320]   to sit for the CPA exam in the state of New Jersey.
[00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:05.800]   The degree is a 120 credit program.
[00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:10.840]   Upon graduation, students can seamlessly integrate the program into the CPA and master's track,
[00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:14.280]   which I'll come to in just a moment.
[00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:19.720]   Now listen to the overall plan of earning this degree.
[00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:24.320]   Professional education requirements, intellectual practical skills, written communication, oral
[00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:26.320]   communication, quantitative...
[00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:27.320]   Let me pause.
[00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:34.520]   Written communication would map very nicely to something like the CLEP exam for American
[00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:38.440]   literature or for college composition or for English literature.
[00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:43.600]   The oral communication would map very nicely to the...
[00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:44.600]   What was it?
[00:56:44.600 --> 00:56:49.160]   The DSST exam in public speaking.
[00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:51.320]   Principles of public speaking.
[00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:55.360]   Quantitative literacy, that would map well to some kind of math course.
[00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:56.360]   Information literacy.
[00:56:56.360 --> 00:57:01.400]   Then, civic and global learning, diversity, ethics, civic engagement, knowledge of human
[00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:02.400]   cultures.
[00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:04.640]   Nine credits from that.
[00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:07.080]   Understanding the physical and natural world, four to seven credits.
[00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:08.720]   Mathematics, three credits.
[00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:10.280]   General education electives.
[00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:17.680]   So you could pretty much knock out those first 60 credits easily for Thomas Edison with those
[00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:18.680]   CLEP exams.
[00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:20.760]   Now, professional business requirements.
[00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:22.840]   Financial accounting, three hours of financial accounting.
[00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:32.040]   That would map very nicely to the CLEP exam on principles of financial accounting.
[00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:33.560]   Managerial accounting, that would not map.
[00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:35.960]   So you'd have to take the managerial class.
[00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:42.600]   Business law would map very nicely to the CLEP exam for introductory business law.
[00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:45.160]   Principles of management, that might map very nicely.
[00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:48.520]   And I don't know this, I'm just going based upon an educated perspective, but I haven't
[00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:49.520]   called them and talked to them.
[00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:51.120]   You have to do this with every college.
[00:57:51.120 --> 00:57:57.000]   But that might map very nicely of a business law to, sorry, principles of management to
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:59.960]   the, what was it?
[00:57:59.960 --> 00:58:01.280]   It was the CLEP exam.
[00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:04.920]   Yeah, principles of management CLEP exam.
[00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:07.080]   Computer concepts and applications.
[00:58:07.080 --> 00:58:11.240]   Introduction to marketing, that would map very well to the CLEP exam.
[00:58:11.240 --> 00:58:12.520]   Principles of marketing.
[00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:13.560]   Principles of finance.
[00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:17.120]   That might map well to one of these other ones.
[00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:19.280]   Business and society or international management.
[00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:22.600]   Macroeconomics, microeconomics.
[00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:28.000]   Conveniently enough, there's an AP macroeconomics and an AP microeconomics class or exam.
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:31.680]   Then business and managerial communications and business administration capstone.
[00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:36.040]   That of course, any university requires their capstone to be there in their local area.
[00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:39.560]   Then you've got 24 credit hours required of accounting.
[00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:42.280]   So those are the classes that you go ahead and take from the university.
[00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:46.440]   It's all distance study, intermediate accounting one and two, advanced accounting one and two,
[00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:50.160]   auditing, federal income taxation, and then advanced level accounting and collectives
[00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:52.360]   and cost accounting and advanced audit.
[00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:57.640]   At the end of that, those online courses would take, depending on the student, they're not
[00:58:57.640 --> 00:58:59.960]   easy, but they would take a certain amount of time.
[00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:03.440]   The end of that, now you have a bachelor's degree in accounting.
[00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:09.120]   Now in addition to that, Thomas Edison State University has options where they will give
[00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:10.120]   you credit.
[00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:14.320]   They have other examinations that they'll provide for you of the, what do they call
[00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:19.760]   the TECEP exams, where they'll give you, it's the, they call them the Thomas Edison Credit
[00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:21.480]   by Examination Program.
[00:59:21.480 --> 00:59:24.760]   So they'll take, they have hundreds of different subjects that they'll allow you to take an
[00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:29.880]   exam on and demonstrate your knowledge, which can help you to just skip to have to take
[00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:32.760]   the class and they'll give you credit for it if you credit by exam.
[00:59:32.760 --> 00:59:36.840]   But in addition to that, they'll give you credit for studying for and taking the CPA
[00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:37.840]   exams.
[00:59:37.840 --> 00:59:39.800]   So now let's move on to the CPA and master's track.
[00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:44.360]   The CPA and master's track provides accountants who possess a bachelor degree, but who are
[00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:49.000]   not yet certified with an opportunity to earn the extra credits needed to become a CPA and
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:51.260]   earn a master's degree at the same time.
[00:59:51.260 --> 00:59:56.240]   The university can award candidates up to six credits for passing the uniform CPA exam
[00:59:56.240 --> 00:59:59.800]   and enroll them in the Master of Science and Management Program, where they can earn the
[00:59:59.800 --> 01:00:04.160]   remaining 30 credits needed for certification, as well as the master's degree.
[01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:08.400]   The MSM program focuses on the organizational leadership and integrates management theory
[01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:11.360]   and practice as they apply to the accounting industry.
[01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:15.680]   The CPA and master's track provides an affordable, flexible method to earn the 30 additional
[01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:19.400]   credit hours needed to become a CPA and enables candidates to earn a master's degree at the
[01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:21.960]   same time.
[01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:26.240]   So a student who's interested in accounting, who's competent with math, who's able to pass
[01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:32.440]   the CPA exam, makes the CPA exam their project for one year, one and a half years, whatever
[01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:33.440]   it takes.
[01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:35.600]   They pass all four sections of the CPA.
[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:38.120]   They go ahead and do these master's degree programs.
[01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:41.240]   Now they've fulfilled all the requirements of the CPA except the experience requirement.
[01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:43.000]   We'll get to that in just a moment.
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.600]   And now they have a master's degree.
[01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:47.360]   And this is not six years of work, right?
[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:50.240]   This is not, sorry, this is not 10 years of work.
[01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:54.920]   The average track here is four years of high school, ninth through 12th grade, then go
[01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:59.120]   get four years of college degree to get a general business degree, take four whole years
[01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:02.400]   from that, and then go and take another two years to get a master's degree.
[01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:06.120]   Now, of course, somebody who's studying and gets a degree in accounting will probably
[01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:10.960]   start sitting for the CPA the year after they're done with the four years, but this can be
[01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:12.600]   done much more quickly.
[01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:17.920]   So you give me that 15 year old, that 14 year old, this could be done by 18, 19, 20, somewhere
[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:22.760]   like that, depending on how diligent and motivated the student is to get this done.
[01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:31.320]   It's well within the competency of a motivated student who has good character, who's willing
[01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:36.620]   to study on a daily basis to finish this up in a few years.
[01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:37.920]   Could it be done by 18?
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:38.920]   Could be.
[01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:39.920]   Could it be done by 19?
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:40.920]   Absolutely.
[01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:41.920]   Could it be done by 20?
[01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:42.920]   Certainly.
[01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:45.480]   For a motivated, competent student, absolutely.
[01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:51.280]   And so now you have a student who has a master's degree in accounting, a CPA license, and the
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:54.160]   only thing that's missing for the CPA, of course, is you have to fulfill this experience
[01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:55.160]   requirement.
[01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:58.760]   What I would do is I would make sure that I have my student working along the way.
[01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:02.560]   I would find a local accountant and I would have them volunteer and help volunteer and
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:07.200]   or help the accountant and do work as a bookkeeper in the accountant's office every afternoon.
[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:11.960]   I would encourage them to devote the first half of their day to academics and then work
[01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:16.520]   from say one o'clock to five o'clock, four hours every afternoon for a local accountant.
[01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:19.480]   And over time they build up the accounting experience, they start working with clients,
[01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:22.200]   they do bookkeeping, they learn the relevant software.
[01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:26.360]   I would have them do a certification course in QuickBooks, et cetera, learn and get some
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:31.000]   certifications for the use of the applicable accounting software.
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.360]   And they could go ahead and build a little side hustle of doing tax returns for people
[01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:35.920]   on their own.
[01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:40.680]   They can do that locally, they can do that internationally, they can do the work right
[01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:44.320]   over the computer just like so many accountants are doing right now.
[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:49.720]   So this is the kind of thing that provides somebody with a clear outcome and they can
[01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:56.000]   start their accounting career at with a master's degree at 18 or 20 instead of later.
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.280]   Now let's talk about a couple of downsides of this approach.
[01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:02.120]   First thing is what about the prestige of the degree?
[01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:06.480]   That does matter in some fields.
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:11.800]   It's extraordinarily important in some fields but in most fields it does matter.
[01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:17.040]   But in a situation like this, the couple of things I would point out.
[01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:21.080]   First if you do an undergraduate degree you can always then go on for a prestigious master's
[01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:22.960]   degree.
[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:27.600]   It's the master's degree that you have that the brand name matters, not the undergraduate
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:28.600]   degree.
[01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:32.080]   It's the doctoral degree where the brand name matters, not the undergraduate degree.
[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:36.040]   You can have an undergraduate degree from the local school but if you have a Harvard
[01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:40.000]   MBA, what everyone notices is I've got the Harvard MBA.
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:45.000]   Doesn't really matter what your local school is but if you got a decent GPA and you got
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:49.840]   a 180 on your LSAT and you went to Harvard Law School or to Columbia or whatever, now
[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:52.080]   that's what matters for the prestige perspective.
[01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:55.200]   Prestige does matter but not in all fields.
[01:03:55.200 --> 01:04:00.720]   Number two, this kind of approach actually gives you a really valuable form of prestige.
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:06.720]   What my experience has been that people who are screening job candidates are often looking
[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:08.040]   for these kinds of stories.
[01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:12.540]   For example, when I was applying for jobs after college I had an interesting story to
[01:04:12.540 --> 01:04:15.520]   present and I would put this on my resume.
[01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:21.780]   I would say I graduated, I self-funded my education at a private university and I graduated
[01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:23.080]   debt free.
[01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:26.360]   They would ask me about that and I would explain the story of how I got out of debt my senior
[01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:30.760]   year of college and how I worked 40 hours a week, I took 18 hours of class, I got straight
[01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:34.280]   A's and how it totally transformed my life.
[01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:42.480]   At that point in time, the career, the particular name of the college didn't matter nearly as
[01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:45.480]   much as the specifics of my story.
[01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:50.240]   In a situation like this, if I've got a degree from Thomas Edison State University and I'm
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:53.760]   applying for a job, I'm going to tell somebody I got my degree from Thomas Edison State University
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:54.760]   at 17 years old.
[01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:55.760]   Let me tell you how I did it.
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:59.040]   I wanted to save money and not come out of school with $80,000 of student loan debt and
[01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:03.520]   we did this, we spent a total of $7,822 on it and I would tell the story.
[01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:09.360]   It separates you as being a hardworking, self-starter, motivated, ambitious person and those are
[01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:12.540]   qualities that really are incredibly important in some careers.
[01:05:12.540 --> 01:05:17.440]   In addition to that, the reason I use the CPA example is that when you're in a field
[01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:21.960]   where there's a form of professional accreditation or certification, the particular degree doesn't
[01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:23.440]   really matter.
[01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:30.280]   If you're a CPA, it's the CPA diploma or certificate that you hang on the wall of your office,
[01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:31.620]   not the university.
[01:05:31.620 --> 01:05:37.680]   But the CPA requires you to have a four-year degree and to have accounting courses in order
[01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:44.220]   to get the CPA degree or credential and to pass the exam, but it's the CPA exam.
[01:05:44.220 --> 01:05:47.400]   So nobody goes into a CPA's office and says, "What college did you graduate for?"
[01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:51.440]   They look up and they see certified public accountant by the state of New Jersey.
[01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:52.720]   Boom, now we know.
[01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:54.140]   And then we come into competence.
[01:05:54.140 --> 01:05:55.320]   Is this person competent?
[01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:56.600]   Can they save me money?
[01:05:56.600 --> 01:06:00.120]   Do they know how to teach me how to set up bookkeeping, how to teach me tax savings,
[01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:01.120]   etc.?
[01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:02.120]   How good is their marketing?
[01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:03.120]   How did they find me?
[01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:05.200]   And those are the things that matter.
[01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:11.400]   So you can help a student to come out with a system like I'm describing here at 18 or
[01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:15.460]   19 or 20 years old, and now instead of having to go to school for another two or three years
[01:06:15.460 --> 01:06:18.520]   and then start, they've already got an independent business.
[01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:23.240]   If that student has worked for an accountant locally during that period of time, they've
[01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:27.800]   built up some sideline accounting clients, that could provide the financial base that
[01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:30.300]   they need to then build on.
[01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:32.360]   Maybe they go start some other string of businesses.
[01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:34.040]   Maybe they're prone to entrepreneurship.
[01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:35.040]   Maybe they specialize.
[01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:38.160]   The world is open to them, but they've always got that college degree.
[01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:42.960]   Check, done, at an early age, with no debt, and they've got some sort of professional
[01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:44.320]   qualification.
[01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:49.000]   Now there are other careers that this kind of approach fits well for.
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:54.200]   I'm using a financial career, but another good career would be something like IT.
[01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:56.800]   What you want to look for when you're doing these kinds of things, you want to look for
[01:06:56.800 --> 01:07:02.760]   some kind of credentialization system based upon skills and knowledge, not based upon
[01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:03.920]   age.
[01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:06.480]   And so IT is a really good scenario.
[01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:11.280]   Thomas Edison will give you college credit for IT certifications.
[01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:12.680]   Other schools will as well.
[01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:21.160]   So if you have certifications from, what are the IT ones, Cisco, or you've got Microsoft
[01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:26.400]   certifications, all those certifications qualify you for a job, first of all, a very decent
[01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:30.840]   good job, but they additionally then get you college credit, and they can work back and
[01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:31.840]   forth.
[01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:33.480]   And so you can build something like IT.
[01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:39.160]   And if you have an 18-year-old who's got a college degree done, now they can always check
[01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:43.520]   the box, "Yep, I've got a four-year college degree," whether or not they're applying for
[01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:46.040]   a job in IT, they can do that.
[01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:51.560]   If you've got that 18-year-old also has the knowledge acquired and the professional certifications
[01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:56.080]   where they can get an IT job, nobody cares about their age.
[01:07:56.080 --> 01:08:01.160]   Now when you put this into a spreadsheet and you look at how much money somebody can have
[01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:05.000]   by starting early, it's powerful.
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:10.280]   One of the things that I've done, I did spreadsheets in the past, and I would say, "What if I started
[01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:15.360]   an 18-year-old and they skipped college, and they just simply started in the trades, right?
[01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:19.280]   They became an apprentice for a carpenter or an electrician or something like that.
[01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:26.720]   And instead of paying money for four years, they earn money for four years, and they come
[01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:30.000]   out, it takes a long time for the college graduate to beat them.
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:34.000]   Even if you assume the college graduate has a higher starting pay.
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:39.320]   If the person going into the trades makes $30,000, but the college graduate comes out
[01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:43.600]   four years later and makes $45,000, it takes a while for the college graduate to earn the
[01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:48.560]   extra $120,000 that the tradesperson earned from 18 to 22.
[01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:53.600]   Now in time, if the tradesperson doesn't increase their income, the college graduate will pull
[01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:54.600]   ahead.
[01:08:54.600 --> 01:09:00.520]   So we can generally assume and understand that a college graduate will earn more money
[01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:03.080]   throughout the course of their lifetime.
[01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:07.640]   Now one of the things that I've often troubled when doing these comparisons is, "But who
[01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:09.400]   are we talking about?"
[01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:13.800]   Because the kind of people who are likely to go to college are also the kind of people
[01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:16.560]   who would likely be very successful even if they didn't go to college.
[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:18.520]   So it's kind of a survivor bias, right?
[01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:25.080]   I went to college because I was under the basic idea that only losers did not go to
[01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:27.360]   college and I wasn't a loser, so of course I went to college.
[01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:29.480]   But I didn't really have any vision for it.
[01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:35.280]   And I don't think that college made any really meaningful impact on my overall career choice,
[01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:36.280]   all that much.
[01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:37.280]   Now it's hard.
[01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:40.640]   You go back and you look and you say, "But this, I met this person and this class impacted
[01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:41.640]   me, blah, blah, blah."
[01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:42.640]   I don't know.
[01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:47.920]   It's just I can't trace any knowledge that I gained from college to my current life path.
[01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:52.360]   I trace people, I trace a little bit of exposure, I don't trace any knowledge to my life path.
[01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:57.800]   And I think that if I'd had a coach or a mentor who was knowledgeable about how to build a
[01:09:57.800 --> 01:10:00.480]   career path and get those same things without college, I think I could have had a lot more
[01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:03.680]   success at an early age skipping college.
[01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:06.600]   But I still get nervous about, "What about the credentialization?
[01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:08.440]   At least having a backup plan."
[01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:12.680]   And so I would be nervous to tell my children, "Yeah, don't go to college.
[01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:13.680]   Just don't even bother.
[01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:15.240]   I'm not there."
[01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:20.280]   And so I see this as a really cool way if it works out, if the student is amenable to
[01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:21.280]   it, et cetera.
[01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:23.520]   I see this as a really cool way of satisfying those things.
[01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:29.600]   Where now you can coach a bright 18-year-old to, "Hey, they got the college degree, maybe
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:34.200]   even a master's degree, CPA exam, get them those experience credits during their teenage
[01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:37.660]   years and they can start earning at 18 years old.
[01:10:37.660 --> 01:10:39.060]   And they can avoid student loan debt.
[01:10:39.060 --> 01:10:43.880]   And we did this whole thing at a total price tag of say under $10,000 total instead of
[01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:45.840]   $80,000."
[01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:48.480]   This is powerful for the right fit.
[01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:53.040]   Now, are there other things about college that are helpful other than academics?
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:54.400]   Certainly.
[01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:59.560]   Social dynamic, having fun, meeting people, expanding your influence.
[01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:03.560]   There's lots of other considerations.
[01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:12.200]   However, even if one of my children needs that college experience, I would a lot rather
[01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:17.480]   they just skip the entry-level stuff and quiz out of those first couple of years and go
[01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:20.280]   right into the upper-level electives.
[01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:24.860]   College is not a healthy place for young people, especially in those entry years.
[01:11:24.860 --> 01:11:30.720]   It's a very good place to make a whole lot of stupid decisions and wreck your life.
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:32.920]   But that starts to change as you get to upper level.
[01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:36.760]   And so even just for the moral rectitude of your child, if they can quiz out of the first
[01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:40.640]   couple of years of college, maybe do an online degree and then go into a master's degree
[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:44.200]   in a specialization where they're on campus in a traditional format, there's a huge value
[01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:48.160]   in that kind of education for some fields.
[01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:53.280]   In those situations, I think it's much better for them to go into the advanced-level courses
[01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:54.600]   than the entry-level stuff.
[01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:59.000]   I mean, there's just so many dangers of the stupidity that happens with 18-year-olds in
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.560]   those first few years.
[01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:06.660]   And so this is even just a way of helping your children avoid some of those dangers.
[01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:09.400]   Not a perfect system.
[01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:11.760]   Not going to work for everybody.
[01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:14.080]   We shouldn't try to make it work for everybody.
[01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:20.720]   But for a motivated person, if you can, and I believe that you can motivate people.
[01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:25.040]   If you lay this out to them, show them the benefits that will accrue to them if they
[01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:27.280]   take this course of action, it can change everything.
[01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:32.960]   And I'll tell you, if I had come along to the 13-year-old me and laid this out for them,
[01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:35.360]   for me, I would have gone with this.
[01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:36.360]   And I've done this.
[01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:37.360]   I've done this in the classroom.
[01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:38.800]   Just tell you, I'll close with one story.
[01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:42.000]   I used to teach junior achievement, and I loved to do it.
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.800]   And I would go in, and I wasn't a great junior achievement teacher because I would do the
[01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:49.440]   curriculum for the junior achievement, but I frankly, I kind of was just a motivational
[01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:53.860]   speaker instead of doing the junior achievement curriculum as much as I should have.
[01:12:53.860 --> 01:12:54.860]   But I loved it.
[01:12:54.860 --> 01:12:57.840]   And I went into junior, high school seniors, high school juniors.
[01:12:57.840 --> 01:13:05.480]   And I just remember how there's one young man, and it was a local government school,
[01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:10.400]   and we went into the classroom, and I was talking about goal setting.
[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:12.800]   And the specific example, I picked on him.
[01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:15.520]   I like to pick on students in the class.
[01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:18.240]   And I picked on him, and I said, "Give me a goal that you have."
[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:20.160]   And he gave me a flippant goal.
[01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:24.400]   And he said, "I want to have a Shelby Cobra Mustang."
[01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:25.720]   And I said, "Cool."
[01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:28.280]   I said, "Shelby Cobra Mustangs are awesome."
[01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:29.480]   I said, "What year?"
[01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:30.920]   And I went through goal setting.
[01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:31.920]   I said, "What year?
[01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:33.840]   An old one or a new one?
[01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:34.840]   What color?"
[01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:35.840]   And I laid it out.
[01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:36.840]   And I said, "Okay, how much does that cost?"
[01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:38.880]   He's like, "I don't know, 60 grand."
[01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:41.000]   So we laid it out, and we started talking it through.
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.120]   And then I said, "Well, how are you going to do that?"
[01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:43.120]   And I said, "How much money do you have?"
[01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:44.120]   "I don't have any money."
[01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:45.120]   "Do you have a job?"
[01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:51.960]   "Yeah, I worked at the local ice cream shop."
[01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:53.880]   And I said, "Well, you're making, I don't know, $8 an hour?"
[01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:55.400]   And I said, "Well, that ain't going to work."
[01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:56.400]   And he said, "That sucks.
[01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:58.920]   You're not going to get a Shelby Cobra Mustang working at the ice cream shop earning $8
[01:13:58.920 --> 01:13:59.920]   an hour."
[01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:01.040]   So I said, "What could you do?
[01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:02.720]   How could you make more money?"
[01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:06.400]   And he's a high school senior, kind of a goofy kid, not really engaged.
[01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:07.400]   That was why I picked on him.
[01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:08.400]   He was like, "I don't know.
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:09.400]   I guess I could go to college."
[01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:10.400]   I go, "All right.
[01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:11.400]   Well, how are you going to go to college?"
[01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:12.400]   He said, "I don't know."
[01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:13.400]   I said, "Have you taken the SAT?"
[01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:16.840]   I can't remember if he had or hadn't.
[01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:20.480]   So this is directionally accurate, but I can't remember the specifics at this point.
[01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:22.200]   But he said, "No, I haven't taken the SAT."
[01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:23.880]   I said, "All right, well, take the SAT."
[01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:25.840]   Or maybe he did, and he got a bad score.
[01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:29.360]   And so long story short, I laid out the success path for him.
[01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:33.920]   And I said, "Listen, you can get the Shelby Cobra Mustang, but you ain't going to get
[01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:37.120]   it working at the ice cream shop dipping ice cream for $8 an hour.
[01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:38.120]   That's stupid."
[01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:42.800]   I said, "But what you can do is you can get a great score on the SAT.
[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:46.700]   With a great score on the SAT, you can go ahead and get a college degree.
[01:14:46.700 --> 01:14:48.360]   You can work your way through college."
[01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:51.560]   And I showed him how the SAT score would impact his college tuition.
[01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:53.400]   I showed him how he could make a lot more money.
[01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:54.840]   I laid out a budget for a young adult.
[01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:56.920]   And I said, "You can have this Shelby Cobra Mustang."
[01:14:56.920 --> 01:15:00.960]   I think it was like by age 23, five years, and you have this Mustang.
[01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:03.360]   And the exact details are not important.
[01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:08.120]   You know the path I set him on, because it's what I talk about here every day.
[01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:12.720]   But one of the most meaningful emails of my life came in a year and a half, two years
[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:13.720]   later, something like that.
[01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:15.400]   And he said, "Joshua, I don't know if you remember me."
[01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:16.400]   I did.
[01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:17.680]   But he told me what happened.
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:20.920]   And then later we got together for lunch, and he told me all about it.
[01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:26.480]   But he said, "After you showed me that path, after you showed me that success path, how
[01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:27.480]   I could do that?"
[01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:30.200]   He said, "I decided to do it."
[01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:31.520]   So he started studying for the SAT.
[01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:34.960]   I can't remember if he'd taken it already and gotten a bad score or hadn't taken it
[01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:35.960]   all.
[01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:37.040]   But he took the SAT.
[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:38.080]   He got a great score.
[01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:41.680]   He said, "Before you came in, I wasn't planning to go to college."
[01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:47.480]   He said, "But I've gotten a full ride to a reasonable middle-range school."
[01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:50.560]   It wasn't an Ivy League, but it was a reasonable middle-range school.
[01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:54.760]   He said, "They gave me a full ride based upon my SAT score."
[01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:55.760]   And he told me what he's studying.
[01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:57.200]   I've forgotten what he was studying at this point.
[01:15:57.200 --> 01:15:59.000]   But he told me what he was studying, and he was excited about it.
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.720]   It was something he was genuinely interested in.
[01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:04.920]   And he said, "I never would have done that if you hadn't showed me how to get that Shelby
[01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:05.920]   Mustang."
[01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:10.120]   And I've often thought about him.
[01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:12.000]   His email is in my smile file somewhere.
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.600]   But I've often thought about him.
[01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:22.840]   Here's the perfect example of a goofy kid, just goofing off, came to his stupid junior
[01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:28.280]   achievement business class that I'm going to take, goofing off, about to graduate high
[01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:30.080]   school, just looking to have fun.
[01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:35.720]   And when you show him, "Look, here's how you can get fast success," all of a sudden, they're
[01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:39.600]   willing to work and willing to spend Saturdays studying for an SAT.
[01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:42.320]   And I feel like we don't do that enough for young people.
[01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:46.000]   We don't show them that what they do matters.
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:52.200]   And yet that's the basic cornerstone of behavior change is to see, "If I do this, I may get
[01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:53.200]   that.
[01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:55.480]   Whereas if I do this, I may get that.
[01:16:55.480 --> 01:16:58.240]   And I don't want that, but I do want that.
[01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:02.920]   So I'm going to do these things that are probably going to lead to that."
[01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:07.640]   So what I would do if I were teaching this to students is I would say, "Let me teach
[01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:12.400]   you how to be financially independent and rich by 30."
[01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:14.040]   And I would use this as the foundation.
[01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:20.360]   I would get put in a 10-year career as an accountant from age 20 to age 30, plus the
[01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:22.760]   savings that come from the high school point.
[01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:26.480]   I would layer that 10-year career of an accountant onto an investment plan.
[01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:31.280]   I would lay out a real estate acquisition plan for them to acquire five to 10 houses
[01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:33.880]   from 20 to 30.
[01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:38.160]   And now at 30, you're financially independent, hundreds of thousands of dollars in the bank,
[01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:43.960]   five to 10 houses paying you money, and a career that you got as a backup option.
[01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:45.440]   Got it."
[01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:52.480]   And so don't just write off my ideas here just because you say, "My 13-year-old just
[01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:54.440]   wants to play video games all day.
[01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:56.840]   My 13-year-old says they want to be a YouTuber.
[01:17:56.840 --> 01:17:58.080]   They're not going to take exams."
[01:17:58.080 --> 01:18:01.360]   First of all, don't write off any child, right?
[01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:02.360]   Don't write off any student.
[01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:05.980]   They're all important, and we need to find out how to work with each one of them.
[01:18:05.980 --> 01:18:08.920]   But this success path is totally doable.
[01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:13.480]   These exams are not tough for someone who's academically oriented.
[01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:16.720]   This is doable.
[01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:22.480]   It may even be easier since your child is already doing distance learning.
[01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:23.680]   So do some digging.
[01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:24.760]   Read some CLEP exams.
[01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:25.760]   Look around.
[01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:28.920]   If you want more on this topic, if you want a course with all the universities and all
[01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:30.760]   the stuff that's in my files, I'm happy to...
[01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:31.760]   I don't know.
[01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:33.800]   If there's interest, I could do that.
[01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:38.520]   But lay this path out.
[01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:40.280]   Weigh the potential downsides.
[01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:44.600]   It's not perfect, but I think it's really good.
[01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:49.160]   I think it's really good from an academic perspective because most college degrees are
[01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:50.880]   not going to feed academics.
[01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:53.380]   You need to learn, you study on your own.
[01:18:53.380 --> 01:18:58.760]   To get a degree, you study in a college, with the exception of some hard sciences.
[01:18:58.760 --> 01:19:00.800]   Generally, to learn, you study on your own.
[01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:04.320]   To get a degree, you go to college.
[01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:08.040]   Not perfect for all situations socially, but man, it's a lot safer environment to have
[01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:15.920]   your 18-year-old living at home in a safe environment, somewhat insulated from some
[01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:21.000]   of the pressures of that age group at college.
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:24.320]   You got to make sure that your students are getting social engagement, but that can be
[01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:25.400]   accomplished in many ways.
[01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:28.560]   You got to make sure that they're being exposed to potential marriage partners.
[01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:32.000]   Those are all things, but they don't have to happen in college.
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:36.120]   You tell that 18-year... that student of yours who's struggling and is just ticked off because
[01:19:36.120 --> 01:19:39.920]   of having to go to school on Zoom, "Listen, buddy, why don't we swap this in for a few
[01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:41.960]   years and you go ahead and get a college degree by 18?"
[01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:45.000]   Yeah, if you want your GED, you can do that too, but you don't need it because you have
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:46.000]   a college degree.
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:50.600]   All of a sudden, it might change the motivation of your student.
[01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:53.080]   Hope these ideas have been helpful to you.
[01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:54.080]   Thanks for listening.
[01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:57.560]   Remember, I've got some courses available at radicalpersonalfinance.com/store.
[01:19:57.560 --> 01:20:00.600]   Best one there would be the career and income course, Radical Personal Finance Guide to
[01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:01.960]   Career and Income Planning.
[01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:05.760]   Put simply, if you get your career right and your income right and you start early and
[01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:10.280]   you get something that you can work late, finances are amazing, but you got to do some
[01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:12.160]   thoughtful analysis.
[01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:16.680]   Don't forget that if you're in a career that you feel stuck in and you want to rework,
[01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:20.120]   remember that this is not exclusive to children.
[01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:22.560]   This is not exclusive to teenagers.
[01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:23.560]   You can do this too.
[01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:28.120]   So, if you're 49 years old and you're just annoyed and you feel like you need a college
[01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:33.120]   degree, get cracking on the CLEP exams, go to an institution like Thomas Edison, see
[01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:37.960]   what they'll give you for credit by examination, see what they'll give you for life experience,
[01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:42.240]   see if you can trade in some of your professional certifications for some college credit, and
[01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:43.560]   then get to the online learning.
[01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:44.800]   It's quite in vogue these days.
[01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:53.640]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
