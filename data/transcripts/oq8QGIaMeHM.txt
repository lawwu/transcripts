[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.880]   Pastor John, you have for years stressed an approach to Reformed Theology that is both
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.840]   hard thinking and deep feeling.
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.880]   Each of us will tend to fall on one side or the other here, either into an anti-intellectual
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.220]   feeling or an anti-feeling intellectualism.
[00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.460]   Both are to be avoided.
[00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.360]   In today's question, a listener wants to know this.
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.440]   Dear Pastor John, in your 30 plus years of ministry, what have you practically done to
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:34.720]   avoid mere intellectualism, a cold academic study in your Bible reading and in your exposition?
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:35.920]   What would you say?
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:45.720]   The first thing I would say is that I need to be, we need to be deeply persuaded that
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:58.200]   this really, really matters, this non-cold, non-intellectualistic, warm, practical, affectionate
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.420]   relation to the living Christ.
[00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.240]   We need to be persuaded this really matters because there are a lot of people out there,
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:10.140]   I keep bumping into them, there are a lot of people out there who either for personality
[00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.600]   reasons or sometimes theological reasons think it doesn't matter what your emotions do.
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.400]   That is, they think emotions are the caboose at the end of the train.
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.240]   They're just not essential at all.
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:31.680]   And it sounds like the person who wrote this question is persuaded that they matter and
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.320]   it might be good to ask why.
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.840]   And here's my reason.
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:42.080]   The first and greatest commandment is not to know the Lord our God, which is of course
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:49.720]   assumed, but to love the Lord your God, and that includes with all your heart.
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:57.560]   And Paul says at the end of 1 Corinthians, "If you don't love the Lord, you are accursed."
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.560]   Love the Lord.
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.160]   And Jesus says, "Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and whoever
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.680]   loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me."
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.880]   In other words, the love that we must have isn't just a kind of dutiful commandment-keeping
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:12.880]   love.
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.120]   That's not what you have for your kids or your parents.
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:24.400]   It's the deepest, heartfelt, affectionate, relative kind of love, the kind we have for
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.460]   mother and father and son and daughter.
[00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.720]   Only more, more for Jesus.
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.720]   And if we don't have it, we're not worthy of Jesus.
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.680]   So this is the first thing I would say.
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:42.920]   We must be totally, John Piper must be totally persuaded that knowing God truly without loving
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.920]   him duly is eternally deadly.
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:46.920]   Deadly.
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.840]   I must be persuaded of that.
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.880]   So I'm trembling at the thought that I could go about my academic work or my scholarly
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:00.400]   work or my writing work or preaching work or study work in some kind of cold frame with
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.800]   no awakened love for God, affection for God.
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:11.480]   So the quest for overcoming what he's referring to as intellectualism is a life and death
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.480]   battle.
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.480]   That's the first thing.
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:21.000]   Second thing I would say is that we should therefore read all things, Scripture and everything
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.240]   else, especially the Word, the Scripture, but also the world and everything in it.
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:35.020]   We should read everything on the lookout for evidences of God's value, not just evidences
[00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.120]   of his truth.
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:46.340]   The devil owns that God is true and probably knows more true things about God than we do.
[00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:53.520]   But the devil will not own that God is supremely valuable and supremely satisfying.
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.280]   The devil values himself above God.
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.880]   God's presence gives no joy and no satisfaction to the devil whatsoever.
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:09.680]   Therefore our aim in reading the Bible should not be demonic.
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.080]   We're not aiming to rise just to the level of the devil.
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:20.360]   Our aim is, of course, to see what is really there and what is true about God, but always
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:28.640]   more, always more, namely with a view to feeling what is valuable about God, treasuring the
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.000]   treasure that God is.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.640]   The aim is to see the millions of reasons why God is a treasure, not just the millions
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:43.040]   of evidence that God exists or has certain attributes.
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:52.360]   All of our theological refinement should be for the sake of doxological embrace and enjoyment.
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.900]   This affects the way you read.
[00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:54.900]   This is what I try to do.
[00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.000]   I try to read.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.840]   You read on the lookout for evidences of value, evidences of preciousness, evidences that
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:08.360]   he's beautiful and sweet and satisfying.
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:19.320]   Peter says in 1 Peter 2, verses 1 to 3, "Long for the pure spiritual milk," and I think
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:25.800]   he means milk of the Word, "that by it you may grow up into salvation, if indeed you
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.520]   have tasted that the Lord is good."
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.360]   Well, what's the point of that "if," "if you have tasted"?
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:43.120]   The point is that all the drinking in the world without tasting will not grow us up
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.840]   into salvation.
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:50.480]   The aim of drinking the Word is tasting the Savior.
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:57.880]   It's the tasting that is the nutritional encounter with the living God that grows us up into
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:58.880]   salvation.
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.040]   That's the second thing I would say.
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:10.180]   In all of our reading, be on the lookout for evidences of God's value, not just evidences
[00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:17.440]   of his truth, which leads now to the third thing that I would say, namely, that the goal
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:26.520]   of valuing or treasuring or feeling the preciousness of or enjoying the beauty of God in all of
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:33.360]   our reading confronts me immediately with the impossibility on my part of making it
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.960]   happen.
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.520]   You can't make yourself value God.
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.120]   You can make yourself read.
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:44.700]   You can make yourself list off attributes of God that you see.
[00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:51.640]   You can make yourselves list off ways that God behaves, but you can't make yourself feel
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.520]   how wonderful they are.
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:07:01.120]   That's why the psalmist cries out, "Open my eyes that I may see wonders in your words."
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:06.100]   So this third point is pray, pray, pray.
[00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:14.080]   And we pray not only for illumination to see what is really there about God, but to feel.
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:19.880]   We pray Psalm 90, verse 14, "Satisfy me in the morning with your steadfast love."
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:25.480]   Why in the world would the psalmist pray that, except that the human heart doesn't naturally
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:29.440]   feel it when it hears and sees the beauties of God?
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.440]   God has to work this.
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:34.360]   We ask God to make us satisfied in God.
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:39.600]   So prayer is absolutely essential that not only that my eyes would be open, but that
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:43.160]   my affections would be awakened.
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:52.480]   Fourth thing I would say is that beyond the Bible, I read authors who have understood
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:08:00.240]   God deeply and felt him mightily and expressed both the understanding and the feeling with
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.620]   clarity and power.
[00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:08.200]   For me, that has been mainly Edwards, Jonathan Edwards, and John Owen, and C.S. Lewis, and
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.700]   the Puritans.
[00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:19.180]   You need to find the great seers of God and the great lovers of God and the great expressors
[00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:21.800]   of the seeing and the loving.
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:28.160]   I know you, Tony, would put John Newton in that category, and so would I, kind of a latter-day
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:35.040]   Puritan who saw things deeply and expressed things beautifully and felt things deeply.
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:36.320]   So that's number four.
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:47.680]   And finally, I would say open your mouth and bear witness to family and friends and neighbors
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:52.420]   and colleagues to the beauty of God and your joy in him.
[00:08:52.420 --> 00:09:00.520]   It's precisely in giving expression to our joy that intensifies the joy itself.
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:05.100]   A shared joy is a doubled joy.
[00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:07.840]   God loves mission.
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:09.560]   God loves witness.
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:11.240]   God loves sharing.
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:14.040]   God loves loving people.
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:18.280]   And he does not love hoarding.
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:28.240]   Therefore, when we turn our affections, when we turn on our affections and express them,
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:35.080]   express them to other people, God is pleased and our joy is intensified.
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:41.300]   So those are my five strategies against cold intellectualism.
[00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:47.140]   There are lots more strategies, but maybe that's enough to set the trajectory of discovery.
[00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:48.140]   Yeah, sure is.
[00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:49.140]   Amen.
[00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:54.160]   Thank you, Pastor John, for those five strategies, and I appreciate the shout-out to John Newton
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:59.380]   and his focus on the affections, on the desires of the heart, which became the focus of my
[00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:00.380]   book.
[00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:03.180]   Pastor John, you alluded to this, and you wrote the foreword for it.
[00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:07.380]   It's titled, "Newton on the Christian Life to Live is Christ."
[00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:09.740]   At least you will enjoy the foreword by Pastor John.
[00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:10.980]   I know that much.
[00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:15.620]   And for more strategies from Pastor John, see his book, "When I Don't Desire God."
[00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:18.180]   There's a lot more there on this theme.
[00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:24.140]   Well, is Christian hedonism only for complementarians, or is it something that can be shared by egalitarians
[00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:25.140]   as well?
[00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:27.160]   And what do those terms even mean to begin with?
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:30.420]   We return on Wednesday, and Pastor John will answer a pretty interesting question from
[00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:32.580]   a listener on this topic.
[00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:34.940]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke, and we will see you then.
[00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:35.440]   [END]
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.440]   1.
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:37.440]   What is the relationship between the Christian and the non-Christian?
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.440]   2.
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:39.440]   What is the relationship between the Christian and non-Christian?
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:40.440]   3.
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:41.440]   What is the relationship between the Christian and the non-Christian?
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:42.440]   4.
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:43.440]   What is the relationship between the Christian and the non-Christian?
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.440]   5.
