[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.840]   My most important rule for life, don't complain about anything.
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.920]   Because when you complain about something, you are just giving too much energy to it.
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.380]   You're giving too much power to that thing.
[00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.340]   And the way to reassume that power is to not allow it to command your mind.
[00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.680]   If you can affect the thing, if you have the power to actually change it,
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:21.980]   go do something about it.
[00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.900]   And if not, you're just giving too much energy spending time thinking about it.
[00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.900]   So move on to something that you can actually affect.
[00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:34.780]   Since hearing that, I have tried to adopt it and catch myself anytime I complain like,
[00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.360]   "Why? Can I fix this? If I can't fix it, why complain?"
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.200]   And it's stress.
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.620]   I mean, it's like, it's the same thing, right?
[00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.700]   If I'm not, if I can't change it, I can't impact it in any way, I'm not going to stress about it.
[00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.660]   And like everything else, I'm not saying I'm perfect about this.
[00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.380]   And I constantly need the reminder in my own head.
[00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.580]   But not complaining really will change your life.
