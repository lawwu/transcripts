[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.080]   Melanie Carelli is a faithful podcast listener
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.000]   and she recently wrote us an amazing testimony
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.560]   of how John Piper's 1985 sermon
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.440]   on Romans chapter eight, verses 28 to 30,
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.560]   changed her life as she came to understand
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.920]   how she was saved.
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.500]   It was an incredibly encouraging email to receive
[00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.080]   and it's great to be reminded of the real life
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.680]   implications of our theology
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.480]   and hoping the sermon would help others,
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.680]   Melanie sent us a clip for the podcast
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.600]   where John Piper explains why God's sovereignty
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.720]   in our salvation matters for life.
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.520]   Here's what he said.
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.880]   The doctrines of unconditional election
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.680]   and predestination and effectual calling
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.000]   tend to root out all boasting and pride and self-reliance.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.920]   You ever get gripped by these things,
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.080]   you will be a broken person.
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.560]   You will not take one ounce of credit
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.000]   for your salvation,
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.520]   neither the provision of it in the cross
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.760]   nor the application of it in faith.
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.680]   You will give it all to God
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.760]   and you will humble yourself before him.
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.920]   Now here again, in talking with my friends
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.360]   who don't agree with me,
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.080]   this is one of the things they say.
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.560]   They say, "Piper, you don't need to say
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.980]   "that faith is a gift in order to eliminate boasting.
[00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.520]   "You don't need to say that God gives faith.
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.800]   "All you need to do is say that salvation is by faith,
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.680]   "not by works because faith itself rules out boasting."
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.280]   And then they quote Romans 3:27, which says,
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.500]   "Boasting is excluded on what principle?
[00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.440]   "On the principle of works?
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.400]   "No, on the principle of faith."
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.740]   And they say, "See, faith all by itself excludes boasting.
[00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.920]   "You don't need to be driven by logic
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.280]   "to say that faith is a gift in order to rule out boasting."
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.080]   To which I respond twofold.
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.160]   One, I'm not driven by logic to say faith is a gift,
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.280]   I'm driven by exegesis.
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.440]   It's taught in the Bible.
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.180]   It's icing on the cake that it happens to smash pride,
[00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.800]   but that's not the reason I invent it.
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.600]   It's taught in the Bible that faith is a gift.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.480]   We're dead in our trespasses and sins.
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.200]   Nobody would ever believe and perform
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.640]   the most beautiful act of morality that can be performed,
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.840]   namely faith, if God didn't enable us
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.960]   to get rid of our hard hearts and have a heart of flesh.
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.480]   But that's not the main response.
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.160]   My main response to this criticism is,
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.960]   "Yes, yes, faith eliminates boasting by itself."
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.560]   Why?
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.160]   Because faith in the New Testament
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.120]   is faith in all of salvation, not only a piece of salvation.
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.240]   New Testament faith is not just faith in God
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.360]   to provide us with the cross,
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.520]   it's faith in God to work in us
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.920]   that which is pleasing in His sight.
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.240]   Faith in the New Testament doesn't just say,
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.040]   "I choose you, Christ."
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.480]   Faith in the New Testament says,
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.760]   "I rest in you, Father, to draw me to Christ."
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.680]   Of course faith rules out all boasting.
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.520]   It's faith in everything the Bible says,
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.080]   not just a little piece of what the Bible says.
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.000]   Suppose that you were drowning in a lake
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.320]   and the Son of God were standing on the beach
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.280]   and He saw you drowning and He tossed you an inner tube
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.280]   and it landed in your vicinity
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.240]   and you flailed your way over to it and got a hold of it,
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.440]   paddled your way to shore gasping.
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.120]   You'd thank Him for the inner tube at least.
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.880]   But suppose that you were dead at the bottom of a lake
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.800]   and your family was dragging the lake for you,
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.520]   missing you since the morning,
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.920]   and you had been an enemy of the Son of God all your life,
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.840]   rejecting Him and spurning Him.
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.520]   And He walks up and says,
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.600]   "You can put that stuff away, I'll find it."
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.440]   And He swims out and dives down and pulls you up
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.040]   and pulls you to shore, lays you down,
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.840]   kneels down and works on you all day,
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.040]   all afternoon, works, works.
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.480]   And all of a sudden there's a twitch of life
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.040]   and you breathe and you're alive again
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:22.600]   and He falls at your side, dead, exhausted.
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.240]   And you get up on your knees and you look down at His face
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.360]   with tears of love streaming down your face
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.360]   and you hear a voice from heaven saying,
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.360]   "This is my beloved Son.
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.280]   With Him I am well pleased.
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.480]   Rise, my son."
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.280]   He comes alive and He stands up and He looks down at you
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.600]   and you see in His face more personal affection for you
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.840]   than you have ever seen in any face in all the world.
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.480]   He puts His hand down,
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.960]   very gently and yet very firmly takes your hand
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.960]   and pulls you up and looks you in the face and says,
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.840]   "Follow me and I will work everything together
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.000]   for your good all the days of your life."
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.320]   Which way did you get saved?
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.400]   You flail your way over to the inner tube
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.280]   and kick your way to heaven?
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.560]   Or did you get raised from the dead?
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.560]   How are you going to give God glory today?
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.680]   How are you going to sing amazing grace?
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.280]   "He threw the tomb and I swam to it."
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.360]   50% to God and 50% to me.
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.800]   90% to God and 10% to me.
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.640]   You name it.
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.400]   Brothers and sisters, could it be
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.480]   that many of the problems and struggles in your life today
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:45.240]   are owing to the fact that you never knew how you got saved
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.200]   and therefore you've never known Christ?
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.760]   You've lived a half-life with God.
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.960]   You thought it was half yours and half His.
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.560]   And this morning, maybe all of a sudden,
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.440]   you could wake up to what He did for you
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.080]   so that you could start loving Him
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.160]   with an appropriate affection,
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.760]   so that you could be humble to the dust.
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.000]   Could it be that this would be the day
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.040]   you would be awakened to life
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:16.560]   because you heard the gospel for the first time in its power,
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.200]   that it was God who swam to the bottom
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.600]   at the cost of His Son's life and pulled you up
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.760]   and not just heaved you an inner tube
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.800]   and waited for your self-determined flailings
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.280]   to get you onto the boat?
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.440]   -Powerful image.
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.800]   That was taken from John Piper's 1985 sermon,
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.320]   "Those Whom He Predestined He Also Called,"
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:42.720]   Part 1, a sermon on Romans 8, 28-30,
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.680]   with some Ephesians 2 mixed in there as well.
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.440]   The entire sermon can be found at desiringgod.org, of course.
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:55.160]   Well, as we draw closer and closer to Easter 2016,
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.560]   I'm going to call on two friends
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:00.160]   to help us appreciate the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.480]   And tomorrow, we will look at 10 ways
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.440]   that Easter changes everything.
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:09.040]   Yes, literally everything is changed by Easter.
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.240]   We'll talk with one scholar who has a lot to say on that.
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.320]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.840]   Thanks for listening to the "Ask Pastor John" podcast.
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.440]   I'll see you tomorrow.
