[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.360]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.240]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.040]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.160]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins,
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.600]   and today I wanna do a deep dive on insurance.
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.080]   I've thought a lot about insurance
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.880]   and even written a few newsletters,
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.240]   but after going through the process
[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.560]   to redo most of our policies the last few weeks,
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.280]   I thought now would be the perfect time for this episode.
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.420]   So I'm gonna cover how I ran a process
[00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.920]   to save as much as possible on our insurance
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.660]   while I was still making sure I had good coverage.
[00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:30.880]   I'm gonna talk about the policies
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.660]   I've been focusing on recently,
[00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.120]   which include home, auto, umbrella, and personal articles,
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.000]   but I'm also gonna cover renters, life, disability,
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.420]   long-term care, pet, and even travel insurance.
[00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.600]   Consider this episode a one-stop shop
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.760]   for me to share the learnings
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.200]   from hundreds of hours of conversations and research.
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.920]   And I really hope you enjoy it, but more importantly,
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.680]   I hope it helps you save money and get the right coverages.
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.920]   But I should remind you all
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.560]   that I am not an insurance professional
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.520]   and all my research was mostly done for California,
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.400]   which may be different than your state,
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.240]   so please do your own research as well.
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.840]   But let's get into it right after this.
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.160]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.660]   about life, money, and so much more,
[00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.240]   but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.900]   in your situation, which actually gets harder
[00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.280]   as you build your wealth.
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.560]   So I wanna introduce you to today's sponsor, Longangle.
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.400]   Longangle is a community of high net worth individuals
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.560]   with backgrounds in everything from technology,
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.640]   finance, medicine, to real estate,
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.080]   law, manufacturing, and more.
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.480]   I'm a member of Longangle.
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.440]   I've loved being a part of the community,
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.760]   and I've even had one of the founders, Tad Fallows,
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.900]   join me on all the hacks in episode 87
[00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.260]   to talk about alternative investments.
[00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.960]   Now, the majority of Longangle members
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.780]   are first-generation wealth,
[00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.860]   young, highly successful individuals
[00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.000]   who join the community to share knowledge
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.340]   and learn from each other
[00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.920]   in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.220]   On top of that, members also get access
[00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.560]   to some unique private market investment opportunities.
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.960]   Like I said, I'm a member,
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.120]   and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.100]   because you're getting advice and feedback
[00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.600]   from people in a similar situation to you
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.040]   on everything from your investment portfolio
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.680]   to your children's education to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.120]   So many of these conversations
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.360]   aren't happening anywhere else online,
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.020]   so if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets,
[00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.880]   which is their minimum for membership,
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.040]   I encourage you to check out Longangle,
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.120]   and it's totally free to join.
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.240]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more,
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.780]   and if you choose to apply,
[00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.720]   be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.280]   Again, that's longangle, A-N-G-L-E, .com.
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.440]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.760]   Okay, before we get started,
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.480]   I just wanna talk about why this is so top of mind for me,
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.440]   just so you guys have some context.
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.800]   So a few things have been happening
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.440]   all at the same time, really.
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.400]   One, our new au pair, Stefania, is from Italy,
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.300]   and we're adding her to our auto policy
[00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.280]   so that she can drive with our car
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.700]   and take our kids to museums and that kind of thing.
[00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.160]   That means that I'm gonna be adding a 24-year-old
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.600]   to our policy, which is gonna have a huge impact on rates,
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.920]   and so shopping around actually really, really matters.
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.640]   But also, I've talked in the past
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.400]   about how this year is really a year
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.400]   of consolidation for me,
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.040]   and so I've already done this
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.880]   with banking and investing accounts,
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.640]   closing things down, trying to get them all in one place,
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.640]   but I hadn't done this with insurance,
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.100]   and honestly, I'm having second thoughts
[00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.760]   being almost at the finish line now
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.680]   about how valuable it really is
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.260]   to get all your insurance policies at one place
[00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.720]   from a convenience standpoint.
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.680]   I'll talk about bundling and why it might be worth it
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.280]   from a pricing standpoint,
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.360]   but at the end of the day, if I can save 500
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.320]   or $700 a year and have to pay bills
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.720]   to two different insurance companies,
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.040]   does it really matter?
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.760]   So I'll come back to that,
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.140]   but there are a couple reasons
[00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.420]   why I think this is important,
[00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.800]   even if there's not something like that
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.080]   going on in your life.
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.820]   First off, I was reading this stat
[00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.900]   that 76% of consumers who shopped saved money
[00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.480]   when they started shopping for new insurance.
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:02.760]   So if you like saving money,
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.160]   which if you're listening to this podcast, I assume you do,
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.180]   you should definitely be shopping for insurance,
[00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.520]   at least on a regular basis.
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.100]   That doesn't mean every week or every month,
[00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:11.300]   maybe every year or two.
[00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.320]   The other thing is things change.
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.880]   Your home value changes,
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.080]   the amount of miles you drive, your car changes,
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.360]   so I think there might be things happening in your life
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.400]   that make it worth reevaluating,
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.760]   if not your insurance carrier,
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.000]   at least what your coverage is.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.760]   But I wanna point out that this is not all just about price.
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.920]   I've read hundreds of Reddit comments
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.260]   from people about their claims experiences
[00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:34.480]   with different carriers.
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.100]   Some of those comments were written by attorneys
[00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.120]   who actually fight these insurance companies,
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.080]   people who've had to go through the process,
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.780]   and it seems like a big component that keeps coming out
[00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.400]   is that you get what you pay for.
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.380]   Now, I have some specific examples of this,
[00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.600]   but at the same time,
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.000]   I wanna make sure everyone also knows
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.200]   that insurance companies are heavily regulated.
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.240]   So while one insurer might be more generous
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.520]   with the cash value of your car
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.040]   or make the claims process a lot less work or hassle,
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.600]   I generally am not worried that a carrier
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.920]   might not actually pay out on a claim.
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:04.840]   And in California,
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.320]   as long as your policy is with an admitted carrier,
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.600]   and you'd probably know if it wasn't
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.320]   'cause you had to sign something agreeing
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.940]   that you know they're not admitted,
[00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.920]   the state actually provides a backstop
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.120]   if the carrier were to fail financially.
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.600]   So when I say you get what you pay for,
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.720]   yes, that might mean an easier process,
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.240]   better customer service, faster payout,
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.680]   but it could also be the way the policy is written
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.960]   or the features it includes
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.600]   or even some of the extra features you can add on.
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.520]   For example, on homeowner's insurance,
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.920]   it might be whether your policy even includes coverage
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.960]   for water backing up in your house.
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.360]   With Lemonade, it's not included by default.
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.000]   It might be included but limited
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.160]   to only 10% of your home coverage amount,
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.120]   which is the most common I've seen,
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.140]   or from some premium carriers,
[00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:46.120]   it might actually be covered
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.600]   up to the entire coverage level of your home,
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:49.760]   which is less common,
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.140]   but obviously a much better, more comprehensive coverage.
[00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.000]   On auto, most auto policies
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.960]   will offer some type of rental car coverage
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.140]   in case you can't drive your car because it's in the shop,
[00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:01.840]   but a lot of them have coverage
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.840]   that's like $30 or $50 max per day up to $1,500 total.
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.880]   But some carriers like USAA
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.900]   will not only let you pick the vehicle type,
[00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.000]   so you can ensure you have a large SUV
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.560]   to replace your large SUV, which might really matter,
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.300]   but they might not have a cap.
[00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.500]   They might not have a limit
[00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.800]   to how many days you can rent a car.
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.540]   So those are some examples
[00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:24.640]   of why you get what you pay for
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:25.880]   might be a little different,
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.640]   but I will come back to all the features that I found
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.420]   when I talk about each type of policy.
[00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:32.120]   I just wanna give you a quick idea
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.040]   of what I'm thinking about
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.040]   when I talk about something
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.960]   that might be a higher quality policy
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.080]   and why it's not about
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.040]   whether you're actually going to get paid,
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.480]   and it might be about other things.
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.240]   So let's jump in first and start with auto.
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.720]   According to the Association
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.440]   for Safe International Road Travel,
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.240]   about 4.4 million Americans are involved
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.000]   in a traffic accident that requires medical attention.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.320]   So there's obvious reasons
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.000]   why you might wanna ensure your car and your health,
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.760]   but that also doesn't even touch on the cost
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.620]   that you have to take off work.
[00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:01.780]   You might need to rent a car,
[00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.600]   you might have litigation expenses.
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.680]   So in my opinion,
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:08.040]   and I think almost everyone's car insurance is a must have.
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:10.460]   But before I talk about ways to save,
[00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:11.680]   let's do a brief run through
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.840]   of the major components of auto coverage,
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.880]   because even after doing this multiple times,
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:17.960]   I still come back to it,
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.320]   I wanna make sure I understand it every year.
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.900]   So let's start with liability.
[00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.300]   There's usually two components of it.
[00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.860]   There's bodily injury and property damage.
[00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.640]   The first being if you injure a person,
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:30.600]   and the second being if you cause damage to a car
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.200]   or something else.
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.160]   So that's one thing in many states,
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.640]   if not all it's required,
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:37.480]   and you absolutely need it.
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:40.200]   There's also uninsured, underinsured motorists,
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.420]   which is if you have an accident
[00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:43.820]   with someone who doesn't actually have enough coverage
[00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:47.340]   for your car or for any injuries that are caused to you,
[00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:49.960]   the limits on what you need to have in a lot of states
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:53.020]   and what you can get away with for liability are very low.
[00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.080]   So for example, in California,
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.560]   the minimum liability insurance requirements
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:01.100]   are $15,000 for injury or death to one person,
[00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:03.460]   30,000 for injury or death to more than one person
[00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:06.020]   and 5,000 for damage to property.
[00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:07.740]   So if you're driving around with a car
[00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:10.020]   and it's worth more than $5,000,
[00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:12.100]   it's possible that someone could hit your car
[00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:13.980]   and only have liability coverage
[00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:17.120]   for the property they cause damage to up to $5,000.
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.420]   So I think under uninsured and underinsured motorists
[00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:20.880]   is pretty important,
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.660]   especially if you're driving around a car
[00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:24.860]   that's worth more than your state minimums.
[00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:27.200]   Comprehensive coverage is optional,
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.740]   usually required if you have a loan on the vehicle,
[00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:31.680]   but that covers when you're not driving.
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:34.100]   It covers the vehicle, if it's stolen,
[00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:37.460]   if there's a fire, vandalism, someone keys your car,
[00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:38.700]   and then there's collision,
[00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:42.180]   which is for the value of the car in an accident,
[00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:43.580]   regardless of who's at fault,
[00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:46.700]   if you hit a car or an object or something like that.
[00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.020]   Both of those are usually required if you have a loan
[00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:50.980]   because your lender wants to make sure
[00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:53.100]   that you can collect the value of the car if it's totaled
[00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:54.740]   and you're not gonna be underwater.
[00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:56.740]   And in fact, if you have a really high loan value,
[00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:58.120]   like 100% of the value of the car,
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.420]   you might actually need a gap insurance coverage
[00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:03.460]   just in case the value of the car when it's totaled
[00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.300]   is less than the amount you owe.
[00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.060]   And then last there's medical payments,
[00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:08.660]   which covers you and your passengers
[00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:10.340]   and your car's medical costs.
[00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:11.880]   And you'll notice if you look at your policy,
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:12.980]   it's usually not that much.
[00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:15.420]   It could be a thousand, 5,000, $10,000.
[00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:17.160]   It's usually just to cover the deductibles
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.220]   and the co-pays for your health insurance.
[00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:20.780]   There's also a bunch of extra features
[00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:21.760]   and stuff that I'll get to,
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.180]   but I'm gonna talk broadly about how I think about this.
[00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:26.500]   So the first thing is that you really wanna make sure
[00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.100]   you're covered adequately.
[00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:30.620]   In fact, people seem to have such a problem
[00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:33.620]   deciding what adequate is that some insurers
[00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:35.820]   like State Farm, at least in California,
[00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:37.900]   won't let you price a policy online.
[00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:39.700]   The message I've heard from talking to a State Farm agent
[00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:41.220]   is that there were just too many people
[00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:43.860]   buying policies that didn't adequately cover them.
[00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:45.380]   And then when they get an accident,
[00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:46.980]   they try to blame the insurance company
[00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:48.660]   for letting them have a coverage
[00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:50.180]   that was lower than they needed.
[00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:53.020]   So how do you actually pick the right coverage?
[00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:54.760]   This is gonna be a really personal decision.
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.460]   It's gonna depend on a lot of factors like your net worth
[00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:58.900]   and your comfort with risk.
[00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:01.340]   But I will say on the liability front,
[00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:03.980]   you probably wanna make sure that your net worth
[00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:05.700]   and even maybe your earning potential
[00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:08.260]   is protected because what you don't want
[00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:09.740]   is to get in an accident,
[00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:12.460]   cause damages to a person or a vehicle
[00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:13.760]   and not have enough coverage
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.420]   such that they can come after you.
[00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:16.780]   So someone could sue you,
[00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:19.060]   they could sue you for what you have in your bank account,
[00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:22.300]   your investments, your property, any of your assets.
[00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:23.820]   And in some states, they can also sue you
[00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:25.580]   for your future earnings potential.
[00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:29.340]   So I would be making sure that you have all of that covered.
[00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:31.660]   But if that total amount of your net worth
[00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:34.700]   is over 250 or $300,000,
[00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:37.420]   then I would not actually focus on trying to increase
[00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:40.580]   your coverage on your liability for your auto policy.
[00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:43.180]   I would actually focus on getting an umbrella policy
[00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:45.180]   and I think it'll be a lot less expensive
[00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:47.260]   and it'll be a lot more broadly applicable.
[00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:48.540]   I'll cover that a little bit later,
[00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:50.480]   but just something to keep in the back of your mind.
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.300]   When it comes to comprehensive and collision,
[00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:53.180]   it's actually optional.
[00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:54.540]   So if you've paid off your car
[00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:56.620]   and the car is very inexpensive,
[00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:58.060]   it might not make sense to you,
[00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:00.860]   but we have a Vespa and the value of the Vespa
[00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:03.540]   is probably under $1,000 at this point.
[00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:06.020]   So for that, I only have liability coverage.
[00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:08.300]   I don't have any comprehensive or collision coverage
[00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:10.740]   because I just think at the end of the day,
[00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:13.020]   having to make a claim on that Vespa
[00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:16.040]   that might impact my rates in the future
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:19.780]   for hundreds of dollars of loss is probably not worth it.
[00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:20.880]   On the medical payment stuff,
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.300]   I would say just make sure you have enough
[00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:23.340]   that you think you can cover
[00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:25.200]   the health insurance deductibles
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.940]   for your family or whoever's in the car.
[00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:29.940]   And then like I said, on the uninsured motorist,
[00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:31.660]   if you have collision protection,
[00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:32.700]   you're kind of gonna be covered
[00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:35.340]   in case someone hits your car and isn't covered enough.
[00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:37.460]   So it's not the end of the world.
[00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:39.080]   And if you have health insurance,
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:39.920]   you might be thinking,
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:41.620]   "Oh, well, at the end of the day,
[00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:44.460]   all I'm gonna have to do if I have problems with my health
[00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:47.220]   to go to the doctor is cover my copays or my deductibles."
[00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:49.820]   And most people probably have that much insurance.
[00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:51.820]   But what if you can't work?
[00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:54.260]   What if you have to take a bunch of time off work?
[00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:55.900]   What if you have a permanent injury?
[00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:57.620]   Your health insurance might cover the treatment,
[00:11:57.620 --> 00:11:59.460]   but it won't go beyond that.
[00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:01.920]   And adding this to your policy is not that expensive.
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.060]   So for our policy,
[00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:04.940]   adding the exact same coverage
[00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:06.420]   for uninsured, underinsured motorist
[00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:08.900]   as we have for our own liability coverage
[00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:10.860]   is less than 5% of the cost of the policy.
[00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:12.260]   So for me, it was an easy thing to add on.
[00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.020]   I think there's two states that require it,
[00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:15.980]   but in general, it's an optional policy.
[00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:17.040]   So that's the coverages.
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:19.460]   But when it comes to the prices, it's kind of crazy.
[00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:20.660]   When I was looking at homeowners,
[00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:24.580]   it was like 10 to 20% variability across different carriers.
[00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:26.620]   But when it came to auto,
[00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:28.820]   I remember as soon as we first got our Tesla,
[00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:30.900]   the difference between GEICO and State Farm
[00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:32.760]   was like 2X the price.
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:33.600]   And even right now,
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.760]   when I'm looking at insuring both of our cars,
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.640]   for me, my wife, the au pair,
[00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:41.160]   the quotes ranged from $3,000 to $6,000 a year
[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.420]   for comparable coverage for everything.
[00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:45.440]   So it's really important when you're doing this
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:47.920]   to also make sure you're comparing apples to apples.
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:51.440]   For the most part, the policies are about the same.
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:54.380]   There are some carriers where the liability limit
[00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:57.820]   is 300, 500 versus 250, 500.
[00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:58.660]   But for the most part,
[00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:00.000]   it's pretty easy to get apples to apples.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.640]   There are a few places like rental car coverage
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:04.420]   and a few extra optional features
[00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:05.920]   that you might not be able to have.
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:09.000]   So for me, when I'm comparing, I turn those features off.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.040]   I make note that those carriers have it.
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.900]   So I might decide to go with a different carrier
[00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:14.780]   because they have some extra features,
[00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:16.900]   but I wanna make sure I'm comparing price fairly.
[00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:18.960]   So the deductibles are for your comprehensive
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:19.800]   and your collision coverage.
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.080]   So assuming you have that,
[00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:23.440]   you get to decide how much you wanna have to put
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:25.920]   out of pocket before your insurance kicks in.
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:28.160]   So a big factor of this is how much emergency savings
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.660]   you have set aside.
[00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:33.160]   And how willing you are to actually make a claim.
[00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:34.000]   For the most part,
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.280]   when you're making a claim on your auto insurance,
[00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:38.320]   you can probably expect that your rates,
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:39.500]   if they don't rise right away,
[00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:42.320]   might rise at the change of the next renewal.
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:43.640]   And so you ask yourself,
[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:46.280]   for a while I had a $250 deductible,
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:47.920]   and then our window got broken into,
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:50.480]   and it was gonna cost $500 to replace the window.
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:53.200]   And I thought, okay, well, if I pay out of pocket,
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.560]   I'm gonna spend $500.
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:56.000]   But if I file a claim,
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.560]   I'm gonna spend $250 for the deductible
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.760]   and the insurance company will cover the other $250.
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:04.680]   But now I have a claim on my insurance history.
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:06.880]   And I've heard varying mixed feedback
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.760]   on whether a comprehensive claim like that
[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:10.180]   will affect your rates or not,
[00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:11.860]   or how big of an effect it had.
[00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:14.620]   But for me, I ended up not making the claim
[00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:16.700]   because I didn't want the insurance rates to go up.
[00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:19.540]   Because even a 5%, 10% change in your insurance rates
[00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:23.460]   might be more, especially over a handful of years,
[00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:26.620]   than the actual savings you'd have right now.
[00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:28.460]   So for us, we actually raised our deductibles
[00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:30.100]   to all be $1,000.
[00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:32.180]   Which yes, it means that if we're in an accident,
[00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:33.520]   if we need to repair the car,
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:36.060]   the first $1,000 is coming out of our pockets.
[00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:39.680]   But it brought the policy costs down a few hundred dollars
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:42.580]   a year, which means if we're not having an accident
[00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:44.140]   every couple of years,
[00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:45.940]   we're actually gonna save money in the long run.
[00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:49.020]   And fortunately, I'm knocking on the wood of my desk,
[00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:50.260]   we have not had an accident,
[00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:51.460]   and we have not had to make a claim
[00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:53.380]   for almost probably 10 years.
[00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:57.100]   So given that, it actually has been a good savings for us.
[00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:58.820]   Another really important thing to track
[00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:00.060]   when you're trying to figure out how to save,
[00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:03.180]   especially in light of the post-pandemic world
[00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:04.860]   where a lot of us can work from home,
[00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:08.300]   is changing your mileage that you report on your policies.
[00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:10.620]   So if you don't drive as much as the average person,
[00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:13.460]   which is like 10 to 12,000 miles a year,
[00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:15.500]   you could actually tell your insurance company,
[00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:18.300]   please price this number of miles a year.
[00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:20.300]   And some insurance companies offer a device
[00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:21.380]   that tracks that,
[00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:23.180]   some just require that you report
[00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:25.140]   your odometer reading every year.
[00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:28.100]   But when we changed ours, which we don't drive a lot,
[00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:31.820]   we're at 3,500 miles for one car, 5,000 for another,
[00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:34.260]   the policy prices went way, way down.
[00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.620]   So make sure that if you're not driving a lot,
[00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:38.220]   you can actually track this.
[00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:40.900]   If you don't know where you're at, one tip here,
[00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:43.780]   if you have any service records for your vehicle,
[00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:45.260]   you can go back and look at them,
[00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:48.200]   and they usually put in your odometer reading
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:49.820]   when you go in for service.
[00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:51.500]   So you should be able to go back and look,
[00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:54.500]   oh, if two years ago, your odometer read something,
[00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:57.640]   now two years later, it's only 5,000 miles more,
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:00.420]   then you're only driving the car 2,500 miles a year,
[00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:02.020]   and you could save a lot of money
[00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:05.740]   if your policy is priced at you driving 12,000 miles a year.
[00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:08.020]   Another way to save if you have the cashflow
[00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:09.980]   is that for a lot of carriers,
[00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:12.700]   paying monthly comes with a little bit of an extra fee.
[00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:15.660]   So if you pay upfront in full, you might save that.
[00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:16.860]   And also when it comes to payments,
[00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:19.900]   some carriers give you a discount if you sign up for autopay.
[00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:21.620]   So when I was talking with USAA,
[00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:23.140]   they told me depending on the state you live in,
[00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:24.980]   you can get up to 5% off your policy
[00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:27.380]   if you enroll in automatic payments.
[00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:30.240]   And they don't charge a fee for doing things monthly,
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.340]   so it was like a double win,
[00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:34.220]   except they said it's not eligible in California,
[00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:35.620]   but it's 5% in Florida,
[00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:37.560]   so if you're in Florida, that's a great option.
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:40.820]   And also, if you have a big insurance bill,
[00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:43.380]   one great thing is that if you pay in full,
[00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:45.100]   you can time that really nicely
[00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:46.560]   with a credit card signup bonus
[00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:48.820]   that you need to hit a minimum spend right away.
[00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:50.340]   So that's something.
[00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:52.700]   In some states also, not California,
[00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:54.740]   but insurance companies charge less
[00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:56.060]   if you have good credit,
[00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:59.180]   or if you take a driving course or different things,
[00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:00.020]   depending on your record.
[00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:01.680]   So when you're going through your policy,
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:03.660]   ask your insurance agent or ask people,
[00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:04.940]   are there things that I can do?
[00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:06.380]   Is this being factored in?
[00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:08.060]   If your credit was being factored in,
[00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:09.580]   then it might be worth spending time there.
[00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:12.700]   If taking a driving course can drop your limits,
[00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:15.460]   might be worth the cost, depending on how much that costs.
[00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:19.220]   There are also discounts if you have anti-theft devices,
[00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:21.580]   tracking devices like OnStar and LoJack
[00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:22.940]   and that kind of stuff.
[00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:24.600]   I think it's always worth finding out
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:25.720]   what that discount would be
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:27.380]   before you go and install these things.
[00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:29.100]   A lot of them come with monthly service fees
[00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:31.180]   that might not actually make up for the savings.
[00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:33.460]   And then finally, if a student is on your policy,
[00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:36.040]   maybe your child, if they have good grades
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:37.920]   or are enrolled as a full-time student,
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.600]   sometimes you can get deals there.
[00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:40.780]   So that's a lot of the savings
[00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:42.180]   and the ways to think about it.
[00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:43.180]   I'm gonna talk a little bit about
[00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:44.700]   some of the extra coverages
[00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:46.540]   that you can find on these policies
[00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:48.140]   and just how I've thought about them.
[00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:50.060]   So one is ride share coverage.
[00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:51.300]   If you're driving for Lyft or Uber,
[00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:53.540]   you absolutely should have this to make sure you're covered.
[00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:55.220]   Rental car coverage.
[00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:56.620]   This is one where you've gotta decide
[00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:58.920]   how important is it that I have another car.
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:01.460]   If you have three cars and one of them's in the shop
[00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:03.180]   and you're not gonna need to borrow a car,
[00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:05.100]   then it's probably not worth paying for this.
[00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:06.620]   But if you have a big family
[00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:08.840]   and you only have one car that fits all of you,
[00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:10.980]   it might be worth having enough coverage
[00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:13.460]   for a rental car on that specific car
[00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:15.300]   so that you can rent a comparable car
[00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:16.660]   and be able to go places
[00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:18.380]   without needing to drive two vehicles.
[00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:19.760]   Towing is another one.
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:21.460]   So if you already have AAA,
[00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:22.880]   maybe you don't need to be paying
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:25.620]   your car insurance carrier also for towing coverage
[00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:26.880]   and you might be able to waive that.
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:29.620]   But if you don't, I know having been in a situation
[00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:30.860]   where we have a flat tire
[00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:31.940]   and we needed to call a tow truck
[00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:33.860]   and we actually didn't have the coverage,
[00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:35.200]   it was quite frustrating.
[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:39.020]   One simple trick here is I think most insurance companies,
[00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:41.760]   even USA has a couple day waiting period,
[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:43.660]   but I believe that Lyft Pink,
[00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:45.460]   which is like the subscription service
[00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:47.060]   that sits on top of Lyft,
[00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:50.000]   comes with towing coverage and can be activated immediately.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.500]   So if you're in a bind
[00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:53.040]   and you don't have any towing coverage,
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:56.080]   maybe activate Lyft Pink and schedule a tow.
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:59.120]   There's another coverage that so far I've only seen
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:02.480]   with USAA called car replacement assistance,
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:05.200]   which basically says that if your car is totaled,
[00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:07.460]   they'll just give you an extra 20%
[00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:09.740]   on whatever the value of the car is.
[00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:12.680]   And that can help with getting a new car
[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:14.000]   that's maybe a little more expensive
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.520]   because your car's depreciated
[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:17.220]   because it's obviously been driven.
[00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:18.820]   It could help you upgrade your car.
[00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:20.940]   It could help if there's a gap in the coverage
[00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:23.460]   and how much you owe and you didn't have gap insurance.
[00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:24.980]   It's not the cheapest coverage.
[00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:29.100]   It can be anywhere from 10, 20 to $100 or more
[00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:30.320]   every six months.
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:33.960]   But my sister-in-law actually got in an accident
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:35.000]   that someone else caused,
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.980]   totaled her car in the middle of the pandemic
[00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:38.900]   when cars were really, really expensive.
[00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:41.260]   And without that extra 20%,
[00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:43.100]   she wouldn't have even been able to replace her car
[00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:45.060]   with a used car that was comparable.
[00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:47.780]   So she was so excited that they had that coverage
[00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:50.380]   because it was what enabled them to replace their car
[00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:52.460]   and not have to go out of pocket for that cost.
[00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:55.820]   Then as far as what might vary between different carriers
[00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:57.420]   and things you might wanna ask about,
[00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:00.100]   some of the higher value carriers will do things like
[00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:03.580]   only pay for the cost to repair at any facility
[00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:05.040]   at their rates.
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:06.960]   So in some states, I know California is one of them,
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:08.780]   you can choose where you repair your vehicle.
[00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:11.740]   The insurance company can't tell you where you have to go,
[00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:13.940]   but they don't have to pay the rates of every carrier.
[00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:15.420]   They have to pay fair rates.
[00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:18.660]   There are some carriers that will pay for the rates
[00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:21.100]   even at those high cost facilities.
[00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:23.220]   There are some carriers that either have add-ons
[00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:27.340]   or by default, always pay for original manufacturer OEM parts
[00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:29.100]   and they don't require you to consider
[00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:31.060]   paying for cheaper parts.
[00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:31.980]   I know in a lot of cases,
[00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:34.220]   if they will only pay for aftermarket parts,
[00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:36.820]   you can request them to pay for OEM parts
[00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:38.160]   or you can pay the difference.
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:41.120]   There are some carriers that will replace damaged car seats,
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:43.700]   but it's not standard in a lot of policies.
[00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:45.420]   And so if you're getting in an accident
[00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:49.140]   and you had two $300 car seats, you're out that $600.
[00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:52.360]   And then there are some carriers like Chubb and Pure,
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:53.940]   which I'll talk about a little later,
[00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:57.500]   that are much more kind of high net worth premium carriers
[00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:59.180]   that just have really big coverages
[00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:00.940]   for things like uninsured motorists.
[00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:03.180]   I think Chubb goes up to $10 million.
[00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:04.460]   So if you were to get an accident
[00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:07.260]   that prevented you from working in any capacity,
[00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:09.980]   the state disability policies that you might have
[00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:11.460]   or even a short-term disability policy
[00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:12.780]   is probably not gonna cover the fact
[00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:14.700]   that you can't work for the rest of your life.
[00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:17.580]   And if someone's policy that gets into an accident with you
[00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:20.060]   has no coverage and you're uninsured motorist
[00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:22.220]   that you have only goes to 100,000,
[00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:23.600]   then that's the max you're gonna get.
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:26.060]   But in Chubb's case, they have a $10 million policy there.
[00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:28.140]   So that's something that I think
[00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:31.060]   it comes at an extremely high cost, which I'll talk about,
[00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:33.180]   but I just wanna go over some of the things
[00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:34.640]   that differ between policies.
[00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:36.900]   I'm not gonna go into all the deals
[00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:38.820]   if you're trying to rent a car, how to save money.
[00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:41.580]   But if you go back and listen to episode 66
[00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:43.860]   with Jonathan Weinberg from Auto Slash,
[00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:46.020]   we went through every single rental car hack
[00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:46.860]   you could imagine.
[00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:48.900]   So if you need to rent a car after getting an accident
[00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:50.940]   or anything like that, definitely listen to that
[00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:52.300]   and see if you can save some money,
[00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:54.180]   unless your insurance company is gonna cover it all,
[00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:56.380]   in which case it's not a priority to save them money.
[00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:57.980]   One other thing I will mention though,
[00:21:57.980 --> 00:21:59.540]   is if you're listening to this and you don't have a car,
[00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:03.220]   it is worth considering getting a non-owner liability policy
[00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:06.580]   if you do drive regularly or rent cars regularly.
[00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:10.540]   That one allows you to decline the rental car coverage,
[00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:11.540]   which can be expensive,
[00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:14.140]   because if you don't have your own auto policy,
[00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:16.220]   you definitely wanna make sure that when you're driving
[00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:18.300]   a rental car, you have liability coverage,
[00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:21.620]   and you have liability coverage that matches your net worth,
[00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:23.740]   because some of those default policies
[00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:26.680]   that are included for liability at a rental car agency
[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:28.660]   might be $25,000.
[00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:31.540]   And that's fine if you have a $10,000 net worth,
[00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:32.780]   but it's definitely not fine
[00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:34.060]   if you have a million dollar net worth.
[00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:35.820]   So if you don't have a car,
[00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:37.460]   so you don't have auto insurance,
[00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:39.740]   but you do drive somewhat regularly
[00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:41.480]   or rent cars from time to time,
[00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:43.980]   definitely look into non-owner policies
[00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:45.220]   for liability coverage.
[00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:46.340]   So if you're wondering what I decided,
[00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:47.980]   I will get to where we ended up
[00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:49.780]   after I run through all four policies,
[00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:51.940]   because there's some bundling perspective
[00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:52.780]   that I wanna add.
[00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:55.560]   So that's auto, now let's talk about your home.
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:58.820]   One of the ways I like to keep my mind sharp
[00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:01.180]   is to constantly be learning new things.
[00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:04.100]   And one of my favorite ways to do that is with Masterclass,
[00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:06.720]   who I'm excited to partner with for this episode.
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.020]   With Masterclass, you can learn
[00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:11.300]   from the world's best minds anytime, anywhere,
[00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:12.800]   and at your own pace.
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:14.400]   You can learn to buy and sell real estate
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:15.620]   from Robert Refkin,
[00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:18.260]   or improve your cooking skills with Gordon Ramsay,
[00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:21.000]   or even learn gardening from Ron Finley.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.940]   With over 2,500 classes
[00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:25.700]   from a range of world-class instructors,
[00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:27.380]   that thing you've always wanted to do
[00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:29.080]   is closer than you think.
[00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:30.860]   Seriously, I feel like every time
[00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:31.980]   I wanna learn something new,
[00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:33.740]   I can find a class on the topic
[00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:35.700]   from one of the best in the world.
[00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:38.300]   For example, if you're interested in starting a company,
[00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:40.580]   Alexis Ohanian, who co-founded Reddit
[00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:43.340]   and has invested in multiple billion-dollar companies,
[00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:46.300]   has an amazing new class that will teach you everything,
[00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:48.460]   from finding the problem you wanna solve,
[00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:51.260]   to raising money, to all the operational stuff
[00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:53.280]   like hiring and executing.
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:54.560]   I've spent time with Alexis,
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:56.620]   and he is world-class at this stuff,
[00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:58.900]   so I highly recommend you check it out.
[00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:01.540]   Get unlimited access to every class,
[00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:03.220]   and as an All The Hacks listener,

[00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:13.380]   That's allthehacks.com/masterclass
[00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:15.560]   for 15% off masterclass.
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:19.340]   I wanna tell you all about the most amazing way
[00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:20.740]   to buy a second home,
[00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:22.740]   and I know because we actually bought one
[00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:24.580]   for 1/8 the cost.
[00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:26.700]   And don't worry, I'm not talking timeshares.
[00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:28.340]   I'm talking about Picasso,
[00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:30.860]   and I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:31.820]   So how does it work?
[00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:34.220]   Picasso buys amazing luxury homes
[00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:36.700]   in over 40 world-class destinations,
[00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:38.700]   creates an LLC for each home,
[00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:41.740]   and you can buy as little as 1/8 of the property.
[00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:43.060]   But it doesn't stop there.
[00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:45.980]   Picasso also professionally manages the home,
[00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:48.700]   handling design, cleaning, bills,
[00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:51.100]   repairs, taxes, and more.
[00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:53.900]   And the scheduling system makes it fair and equitable
[00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:56.180]   for everyone to enjoy their home.
[00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:57.380]   When we found Picasso,
[00:24:57.380 --> 00:24:59.860]   it felt like it was made just for us.
[00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:02.980]   That same week, we found the perfect place in Napa,
[00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:05.920]   we toured it, and the next week we were closing.
[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:08.360]   Since then, it's truly become our second home,
[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:10.100]   and it's been so amazing.
[00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:12.280]   And it's true real estate ownership.
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:14.300]   Owners can sell at any time,
[00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:15.660]   set their own price,
[00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:18.980]   and tap into Picasso's active marketplace of buyers.
[00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:20.340]   In fact, on average,
[00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:23.140]   Picasso listings resell in 12 days
[00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:25.500]   with a 12% annualized gain.
[00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:28.740]   For a modern way to buy and own a second home,
[00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:31.820]   go to allthehacks.com/picasso,
[00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:35.360]   where our listeners will get a free Picasso access account,
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:37.020]   which means you can see new listings
[00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:38.820]   before they go on the website
[00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:42.900]   and get up to $10,000 in credit towards closing costs.
[00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:46.820]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/picasso,
[00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:49.860]   P-A-C-A-S-O.
[00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:51.480]   So generally, homeowner's insurance
[00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:54.000]   covers the destruction and damage to your home,
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.220]   the loss or the theft of possessions,
[00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:57.460]   personal liability,
[00:25:57.460 --> 00:26:00.260]   if something were to happen to someone on your property,
[00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:02.460]   or if you need to be out of your home,
[00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:04.500]   your ability to stay somewhere else
[00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:07.100]   while your home's unable to be lived in.
[00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:08.180]   I don't think there's really a question
[00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:10.360]   of whether or not you should have homeowner's insurance
[00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:11.200]   or renter's insurance.
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:12.040]   You should.
[00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:13.260]   Most mortgage lenders require it,
[00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:14.860]   so it's not even an option.
[00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:17.340]   But I will remind people that depending on where you live,
[00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:19.960]   natural disasters like floods, hurricanes, earthquakes
[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:21.840]   are often excluded from a policy,
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:23.440]   and you might need a separate policy.
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:24.780]   Renter's insurance is very similar
[00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:25.980]   to homeowner's insurance.
[00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:27.380]   It protects your property,
[00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:29.160]   offers liability coverage,
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:30.620]   damage to the goods you have,
[00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:32.860]   covers the cost of another place
[00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:34.580]   if you can't live in your current place,
[00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:35.940]   but damage to the building
[00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:37.960]   is actually still the responsibility of the landlord
[00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:39.860]   and covered by their insurance policy.
[00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:42.080]   So renter's insurance is less expensive
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:44.320]   because the big bulk of that policy
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:46.380]   is actually gonna be held by your landlord.
[00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:49.620]   So the main coverages you'll have in a policy like this,
[00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:52.340]   and very nicely, they have letter labels,
[00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:53.500]   so it's A through E,
[00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:55.100]   as I'm pulling up one of the quotes I have.
[00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:57.660]   So coverage A is your kind of main dwelling
[00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:58.700]   and attached structures.
[00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:00.180]   That covers your house,
[00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:02.700]   if your garage is attached, if you have decks,
[00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:04.280]   that's the main coverage thing.
[00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:07.380]   That's the number that it's gonna cost to replace your home.
[00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:09.300]   And that's only on homeowners.
[00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:11.580]   Then there's a coverage B, which is other structures.
[00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:13.940]   So that's if you have a detached garage or a shed
[00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:15.660]   or any other buildings on your property.
[00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:16.820]   Those two, A and B,
[00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:19.020]   are ones that are the responsibility of the homeowner.
[00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:20.220]   The rest of these coverages,
[00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:22.620]   while they might not have this letter on a renter's policy,
[00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:24.780]   you have them on renter's policies as well.
[00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:26.860]   Coverage C is for your personal property.
[00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:28.300]   That's your furniture, your clothing,
[00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:29.780]   anything in the house.
[00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:31.540]   Coverage D is loss of use.
[00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:32.900]   That's if you can't be in your home
[00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:35.720]   and you need to rent a home or stay at a hotel.
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:37.140]   Coverage E is liability.
[00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:38.500]   That's if something were to happen to someone
[00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:41.260]   on the property and that covers your liability.
[00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:43.920]   And then coverage F, like auto, is medical payments.
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:47.820]   That covers the cost of the co-pays and the deductibles
[00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:49.420]   or any medical issues.
[00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:50.420]   And there's two interesting things.
[00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:52.660]   One, your deductible doesn't usually apply here
[00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:54.160]   for medical payment coverage,
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:56.780]   but also if you're able to help someone
[00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:58.340]   who got injured on your property
[00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:01.100]   pay for all of their deductibles or their co-pays,
[00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:03.500]   you might actually prevent them from suing you
[00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:05.340]   for any monetary compensation.
[00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:07.140]   And so that medical payments coverage
[00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:10.520]   might prevent you from needing to take a liability claim,
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:11.880]   which even if your insurance policy
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:13.580]   will cover that liability claim,
[00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:15.800]   it's certainly gonna be better in the long run
[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:17.820]   for your rates to not have to tap
[00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:19.140]   into that liability coverage
[00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:20.900]   and just focus on that medical payments coverage,
[00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:23.100]   especially because the deductible also won't apply.
[00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:24.040]   When I was thinking about this,
[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:26.380]   the most important thing is to have enough coverage.
[00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:28.700]   One thing that we realized in San Francisco
[00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:32.120]   a handful of years ago is that our home appreciated
[00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:34.080]   a lot faster than we'd realized,
[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:36.500]   which was a great thing to have happen.
[00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:37.340]   But when that happened,
[00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:39.980]   the rebuilding costs to build that home went up
[00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:42.220]   and our policy wasn't actually covered enough.
[00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:45.100]   So I definitely think you wanna keep an eye
[00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:48.080]   on the value of your home, the cost to replace it,
[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:49.340]   rebuilding costs,
[00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:51.900]   and make sure you adjust your policies as needed.
[00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:53.340]   A lot of policies have something called
[00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:55.980]   extended reconstruction, which basically says,
[00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:58.160]   oh, if at the time that something happens,
[00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:00.280]   costs have gone up, it will cover the difference.
[00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:02.220]   So that's definitely something that I would add
[00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:05.000]   because you never know what the circumstances will be like.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.820]   During COVID, lumber prices were super expensive,
[00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:10.260]   so you probably would have needed more coverage
[00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:11.740]   than you did the year before.
[00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:14.460]   And so similarly, as we kind of grew up in life
[00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:16.480]   and we upgraded from Ikea furniture
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:17.900]   to more expensive furniture,
[00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:19.360]   you'd wanna make sure you have enough coverage
[00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:20.980]   on your personal property as well.
[00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:23.460]   And so I just like to take a quick evaluation
[00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:25.700]   every year of home values, what's gone up,
[00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:27.500]   maybe ask a real estate agent
[00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:30.420]   what empty lots or teardowns are going for.
[00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:31.740]   And if you could say, okay, well,
[00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:33.380]   I live on a lot this size,
[00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:35.420]   if I could buy a teardown for this much
[00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:36.840]   and I could sell my home for this much,
[00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:39.100]   that delta is probably what it's gonna cost
[00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:40.240]   to build something nice.
[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:41.820]   You could also just ask around.
[00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:43.660]   People often know the cost to build
[00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:45.580]   on a per square foot basis,
[00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:49.120]   or a lot of the insurance carriers have these estimators.
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:51.980]   I found that every time I talked to a carrier,
[00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:54.940]   their estimator came in about 20% lower
[00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:56.060]   than when I talked to someone
[00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:58.540]   who knew about the cost to build in the area.
[00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:03.540]   The good news is that as long as you let the carrier decide
[00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:05.820]   what they think you need to be covered by,
[00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:07.580]   so for example, if your carrier says
[00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:11.140]   you need to have $700,000 of coverage on the house
[00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:13.700]   and you think, well, it might be more like 800,
[00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:16.120]   as long as they're signed off on the 700
[00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:17.420]   and that's the cost,
[00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:21.500]   the extended reconstruction might kick in if they're wrong.
[00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:24.080]   That said, personally, I just wanna make sure
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:26.120]   that I am as close to covered as possible
[00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:28.780]   and that that extended reconstruction only kicks in
[00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:31.940]   if there's actually incremental costs that were unplanned.
[00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:34.000]   So I tried to get as much coverage
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.820]   and not try to save here by using their low estimates,
[00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:39.140]   but I would definitely make sure
[00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:41.100]   you have that extended reconstruction coverage
[00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:42.300]   if the carrier allows it,
[00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:44.100]   or maybe look for a carrier that does.
[00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:46.660]   And some of the high value carriers like Chubb and Pure,
[00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:47.620]   which I'll get to,
[00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:49.500]   might even have something that goes beyond that.
[00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:51.320]   So this extended reconstruction thing's interesting
[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:54.620]   because you can add 20%, you can add 50%,
[00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:56.540]   some carriers let you add 100%,
[00:30:56.540 --> 00:31:00.900]   meaning if that coverage A amount for your home is $700,000,
[00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:04.300]   they'll cover you up to 1.4 million to rebuild the home,
[00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:05.700]   but there are some carriers
[00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:08.180]   that offer guaranteed replacement value.
[00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:10.420]   So it's like it goes beyond whatever percent is,
[00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:12.500]   it's just we're gonna pay to do that.
[00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:14.780]   And then even more than that, some carriers,
[00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:16.660]   and it's really only the high value ones,
[00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:18.660]   so unfortunately it's not something that I think
[00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:20.540]   I'm gonna take advantage of right now,
[00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:23.220]   but they'll give you an option to just take a cash payout,
[00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:25.740]   whereas most carriers will just reimburse you
[00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:27.860]   along the way for rebuilding the home.
[00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:29.640]   So if you don't wanna go through the process
[00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:30.900]   of rebuilding your home,
[00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:33.700]   some of those high value carriers like Pure and Chubb
[00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:36.720]   and Cincinnati will offer you just this one time,
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:39.700]   here's the cash payout, you can take this and sell your lot
[00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:41.100]   and not worry about rebuilding.
[00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:43.020]   So when I'm thinking about these coverages,
[00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:46.160]   I wouldn't think about dialing back any of the coverages
[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:48.860]   to save money unless you really don't need them.
[00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:51.700]   So a few of the ones that I think you can consider
[00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:53.520]   playing around with, but I will point out
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:56.140]   that many carriers just have a fixed number.
[00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:59.220]   So your loss of use might be 10 or 20%
[00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:00.340]   of your dwelling coverage.
[00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:03.340]   Your other structures might be 10 or 20%.
[00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:05.740]   So you don't really get to play with a lot of the dials.
[00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:07.240]   Some carriers though will let you.
[00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:08.980]   So Lemonade, for example, lets you play
[00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:11.260]   with your loss of use and your property coverage.
[00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:14.260]   Some carriers say, do you want 10 or 20%?
[00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:17.060]   When it comes to a few things on personal property,
[00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:19.420]   you probably have some sense walking around your house
[00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:21.940]   at whether you have a bunch of really expensive things
[00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:24.100]   or not, whether your kitchen is done
[00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:26.320]   with really expensive appliances or not.
[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:29.280]   So you might not need as much personal property coverage
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:30.220]   as is default.
[00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:32.580]   So you could dial that back if you don't think you need it.
[00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:35.420]   On loss of use, if you happen to have two homes
[00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:37.260]   or you have family that lives nearby,
[00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:40.140]   plenty of space for you, you might consider not having
[00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:42.060]   as much loss of use coverage.
[00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:44.620]   But if you don't, you might wanna consider having extra
[00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:48.020]   just so that you aren't forced to go live too far away.
[00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:50.840]   Some carriers even guarantee that they'll find you
[00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:53.200]   a place comparable in your school district,
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:54.860]   while others might just give you a budget
[00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:56.500]   and you have one year to spend it.
[00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:58.260]   Which if you know anyone who's built a home,
[00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:00.540]   one year might not even be enough.
[00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:03.660]   Some of the other extras, earthquake is one.
[00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:05.140]   I think it's a really personal decision
[00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:07.800]   because it's very expensive in the Bay Area.
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:10.220]   Your earthquake coverage might actually cost as much
[00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:12.420]   or potentially more than your homeowner's coverage.
[00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:15.900]   Then there's coverage for things like floods are the same
[00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:17.640]   or hurricanes, so look into those,
[00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:19.860]   maybe ask some friends how they've thought about it
[00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:21.820]   who live in the area you live in.
[00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:24.620]   A lot of other small coverages that you need to consider,
[00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:28.180]   whether you need jewelry coverage, both on the policy,
[00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:30.900]   sometimes you can increase the amount that will be covered.
[00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:33.740]   Sometimes it might say we only cover jewelry up to $500,
[00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:36.780]   but you can add something on that will cover any items
[00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:38.860]   up to a thousand or 2000 or 5000.
[00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:41.620]   If you have something that costs 10,000, 50,000,
[00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:43.140]   you probably wanna get a separate policy
[00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:44.000]   and I'll talk about that.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.740]   There's water backup coverage
[00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:47.400]   in case your sump pump fails
[00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:50.020]   or there's water coming through the sewers into your home.
[00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:51.940]   Identity theft, workers comp,
[00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:54.260]   if you have someone living or working in your home,
[00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:56.260]   like an au pair, those are all things.
[00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:57.860]   There are some carriers that offer
[00:33:57.860 --> 00:34:00.580]   what's called a large loss deductible waiver,
[00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:03.700]   which basically means if there is a large loss,
[00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:04.540]   they usually have a limit.
[00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:08.500]   If there was a loss over $500,000 or over $100,000,
[00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:09.620]   they'll waive your deductible.
[00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:10.740]   That's something interesting.
[00:34:10.740 --> 00:34:11.900]   And then that thing I mentioned earlier,
[00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:13.340]   guaranteed replacement cost,
[00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:14.580]   if it's offered would be great.
[00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:16.380]   They're just gonna guarantee they'll replace your home.
[00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:18.620]   You don't have to worry about changing the amounts
[00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:21.100]   or having enough extended reconstruction.
[00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:24.180]   So when it comes to picking these coverages,
[00:34:24.180 --> 00:34:25.260]   gonna be a unique question,
[00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:27.420]   but when it comes to ways to save,
[00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:28.500]   I think there are a few things.
[00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:31.940]   So one, similar to what I was talking about with auto
[00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:33.660]   is think about your deductibles.
[00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:36.660]   For us, I think on the homeowner's policy,
[00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:39.820]   we really want this for like major catastrophic issues.
[00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:42.100]   So we're comfortable with a higher deductible,
[00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:44.780]   knowing that if something small were to happen,
[00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:46.420]   we're just gonna have to pay out of pocket.
[00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:48.940]   And that's what our emergency fund is for.
[00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:51.020]   I don't know what the impact of having a homeowner's claim
[00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:52.260]   is when it comes to rates,
[00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:54.020]   but I know that as we were shopping around
[00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:55.900]   for homeowners right now,
[00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:57.740]   every single carrier asked,
[00:34:57.740 --> 00:34:59.340]   "Have you had a claim in the last three years?
[00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:00.620]   Have you had a claim in the last three years?"
[00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:03.020]   So I can't imagine that it doesn't have an impact.
[00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:05.300]   Also, there are a lot of discounts for homeowners
[00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:07.060]   that you wanna look into.
[00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:09.380]   Obvious ones that they always ask are about alarms,
[00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:12.140]   but especially alarms that report to local fire
[00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:14.460]   and police stations or central monitoring,
[00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:17.020]   fire sprinklers, security cameras,
[00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:20.780]   all those things can reduce your policy by 15, 20%,
[00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:22.180]   but there are also a few extra things to consider.
[00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:24.100]   So we have Ring for our alarm system
[00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:26.500]   and they make these smoke alarm listeners.
[00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:29.100]   We have Nest Protects around the house for our smoke alarms.
[00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:30.540]   And if you put one of these listeners
[00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:32.740]   next to your Nest Protect,
[00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:34.060]   what you can actually do
[00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:35.900]   is turn your Ring monitoring system
[00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:37.620]   that's normally just a burglary alarm
[00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:38.860]   in case someone breaks in,
[00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:40.500]   but it'll listen for the smoke alarm
[00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:42.300]   and report that as well.
[00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:44.100]   And so now you all of a sudden have
[00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:46.620]   a fire and smoke central reporting alarm,
[00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:49.300]   which qualifies you often for more discounts.
[00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:52.900]   They also make a flood and freeze sensor
[00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:55.620]   that you can put in that might qualify you for discounts.
[00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:57.940]   There are also a handful of organizations
[00:35:57.940 --> 00:35:59.100]   that offer discounts.
[00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:01.020]   So when we were looking at travelers,
[00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:03.380]   I started searching for travelers discount
[00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:05.900]   and I found that members of PenFed,
[00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:08.580]   which is a credit union, get a discount on travelers.
[00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:10.220]   It's like an affinity discount.
[00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:12.140]   And so I just joined PenFed
[00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:14.260]   so that I'd be eligible for the travelers discount.
[00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:15.620]   We didn't end up going with travelers,
[00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:17.300]   but it was free to join PenFed
[00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:19.460]   and I wanted to see what the discounted rate would be.
[00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:21.780]   There are also some carriers like USAA
[00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:24.300]   that are only available to specific people.
[00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:26.100]   I wouldn't say you necessarily save money,
[00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:27.660]   though in our case for home,
[00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:29.380]   USAA was definitely the best rate.
[00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:31.580]   For auto, it was a little bit higher,
[00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:34.700]   but by having a father who was in the military,
[00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:36.900]   I was eligible and you're required
[00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:38.620]   to have some relationship to the military
[00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:40.020]   like that to be eligible.
[00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:42.940]   But now that I'm eligible, so will my children, et cetera.
[00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:45.620]   So if anyone in your family is in the military
[00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:47.740]   or maybe it was a grandparent that's still alive,
[00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:50.020]   if they join, then your parent can join
[00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:51.060]   and then you can join.
[00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:53.380]   So definitely something worth looking into
[00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:54.900]   if that's a situation you're in.
[00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:56.100]   And then the other big way to save
[00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:59.060]   is to just comparison shop like I've talked about before.
[00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:02.540]   Unfortunately, there's no great perfect comparison site.
[00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:05.020]   I've looked at a lot of the sites that say,
[00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:07.140]   oh, we'll shop across all the carriers.
[00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:09.700]   They usually only shop across some of the carriers.
[00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:12.180]   So I had to go through and kind of do it manually
[00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:13.340]   and it was a lot of work.
[00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:15.380]   And I actually am wondering whether this would have been
[00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:17.900]   a great virtual assistant task in hindsight,
[00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:20.180]   but knowing I was gonna do this episode,
[00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:22.340]   I think it was something I wanted to do myself.
[00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:23.900]   But one hack that might save you a little time
[00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:25.580]   when you're doing some comparison shopping,
[00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:27.500]   they have all these quizzes about your home,
[00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:29.060]   the size, the roof material.
[00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:30.620]   Some of them get very complicated.
[00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:33.300]   I think the one on USAA is like hundreds of questions,
[00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:35.300]   like what square footage is each bathroom?
[00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:37.220]   Does it have a tub or does it have a shower?
[00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:38.460]   Do you have a chandelier?
[00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:40.900]   And then some of them just ask five or six questions.
[00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:43.500]   But usually at the end of that process,
[00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:46.100]   you can just choose the coverage amount
[00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:48.460]   as long as it's above what they estimated.
[00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:52.060]   So if you want a comparison price, some insurance policies,
[00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:53.900]   you could just run through that quiz
[00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:56.540]   knowing you're gonna get some of the answers wrong,
[00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:59.260]   get to the end, change the coverage to what you want
[00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:00.780]   so you can compare policies.
[00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:03.020]   And then once you find the right one,
[00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:05.220]   I would definitely make sure that when you actually go
[00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:06.620]   to get that policy,
[00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:09.020]   you redo it answering the questions perfectly.
[00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:10.420]   But when you're just price shopping
[00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:11.380]   and trying to get a quote,
[00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:13.340]   you might not need to answer all those questions
[00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:15.580]   because you can change the coverage amount at the end.
[00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:17.740]   And then another big one, I'm gonna talk about bundling,
[00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:20.100]   but it's definitely something to consider,
[00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:22.060]   but I wouldn't always assume it was the best.
[00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:25.540]   For a while, we were with Lemonade and it was cheaper
[00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:28.380]   even though we didn't bundle with auto for us,
[00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:29.980]   but now looking at policies,
[00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:32.580]   I think bundling actually is gonna be a better deal.
[00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:33.500]   And then one last thing
[00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:35.380]   that isn't really gonna save you money now,
[00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:37.140]   but it definitely will in the future,
[00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:41.180]   and it came up in episode 35 with Joe Salciha
[00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:44.580]   is to make sure you document everything you have in your home
[00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:46.940]   for any potential property claims.
[00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:50.260]   So I would walk through with your video on your phone
[00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:53.340]   into every room and just make sure that you point out,
[00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:56.180]   here's our TV, here's our stereo, here's our couch,
[00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:57.980]   here's the person who makes it.
[00:38:57.980 --> 00:38:59.900]   Obviously, some of these things like furniture
[00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:02.860]   or major purchases, you probably have the receipts for,
[00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:05.340]   but I think it would be very, very important
[00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:07.620]   to go around and make sure you've documented everything,
[00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:09.860]   at least in a video, go in your closet,
[00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:12.660]   here's our clothes, go in your room and everything.
[00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:14.060]   That's something that I would do,
[00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:16.060]   garage, tools, all of that.
[00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:19.060]   And I would even consider for really expensive things
[00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:20.820]   like a TV or a computer,
[00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:23.580]   just write down the model and the serial number somewhere,
[00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:25.540]   just so you can kind of prove what it is
[00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:28.020]   and make sure you get properly reimbursed
[00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:29.060]   if something were to happen.
[00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:31.380]   Now, I mentioned earlier that some of the high value things
[00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:32.640]   like jewelry aren't covered.
[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:34.820]   And so if you have any expensive jewelry,
[00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:37.140]   art, bikes, cameras,
[00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:40.440]   you probably need an additional rider on your insurance,
[00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:42.740]   often called a personal articles policy.
[00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:43.940]   It varies by carrier,
[00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:46.500]   oftentimes the threshold is about $1,000
[00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:48.140]   and the policies aren't that expensive,
[00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:51.340]   maybe about 1% of the value of the item.
[00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:52.620]   It's definitely something that
[00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:54.580]   if you have an expensive engagement ring
[00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:56.140]   or a really nice bike,
[00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:58.480]   I would look at covering separately.
[00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:01.140]   The policy that we have for Amy's ring
[00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:02.960]   is less than $100 a year.
[00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:04.420]   And I think it has no deductible.
[00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:06.660]   So definitely something worth looking into
[00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:08.600]   if you have any of those items.
[00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:10.220]   Previously, we talked about liability
[00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:12.080]   and umbrella very briefly.
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:13.780]   But while your home policy
[00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:15.400]   will cover the liability in your home
[00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:18.040]   and your auto policy will cover the liability in your car,
[00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:19.340]   it might not be enough.
[00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:22.380]   For example, if you have $250,000 of liability,
[00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:24.020]   that doesn't mean that someone couldn't sue you
[00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:26.460]   for a million or 2 million or 5 million.
[00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:28.960]   Now, if you don't have $2 million,
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:31.280]   it's unlikely that they're gonna try to expect
[00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:32.420]   to get 2 million from you.
[00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:34.580]   So they're probably not gonna bring a suit like that
[00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:35.720]   against you.
[00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:37.140]   But if you were in an accident
[00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:40.220]   and you caused serious injury or even death to someone,
[00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:43.180]   I could see a suit coming for more than 250,000,
[00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:45.020]   especially if you have more than that.
[00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:47.660]   And so that's where umbrella or excess liability
[00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:49.820]   or personal liability insurance comes in.
[00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:52.660]   And it sits on top of your home and auto policies
[00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:53.980]   and it covers the liability
[00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:56.620]   for as much as you wanna pay for, depending on the carrier.
[00:40:56.620 --> 00:40:58.140]   They aren't that expensive.
[00:40:58.140 --> 00:41:00.020]   They're usually a few hundred dollars
[00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:02.500]   for your first $1 million of coverage
[00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:04.180]   and then maybe another 100 or 200
[00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:05.700]   for every 1 million after that.
[00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:07.260]   Definitely check to see.
[00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:10.780]   They do require usually that one of your home
[00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:13.420]   or auto policies are with that carrier.
[00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:15.180]   It's not always the case,
[00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:18.100]   but I know Geico won't write a umbrella policy
[00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:19.740]   unless you have auto with them.
[00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:22.060]   I know USAA won't write a umbrella policy
[00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:24.820]   unless you have auto and home with them.
[00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:27.640]   So definitely worth talking to someone about that.
[00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:29.660]   When it comes to how much to have,
[00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:30.740]   I think there's a lot of people
[00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:32.220]   that will give you different answers.
[00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:35.260]   I know some people that cover their net worth in full.
[00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:37.820]   I know some people that are comfortable with just a million.
[00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:39.920]   I know some people with a huge net worth
[00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:42.980]   that only think five or 10 million is necessary.
[00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:45.560]   And so I don't know a lot of people
[00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:48.440]   that have more than $10 million of umbrella coverage
[00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:50.320]   no matter how much money they have,
[00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:54.300]   but because some states allow you to go after someone,
[00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:56.080]   not just for the money they have,
[00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:58.540]   the assets they have, but also their future earnings,
[00:41:58.540 --> 00:42:00.480]   it's definitely something that I think
[00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:04.180]   many people might not have, but probably should.
[00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:06.520]   Obviously when you're young and early in your career
[00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:08.920]   and you don't have a huge net worth, it's not as important,
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:10.880]   but as you start to save and have assets
[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:13.080]   and have significant earnings potential,
[00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:14.720]   definitely worth considering.
[00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:17.300]   So that's the four main policies
[00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:19.280]   that I've been focused on recently.
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:22.020]   Let me talk a little bit about how I decided
[00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:24.780]   and evaluated carriers and figured out what to do.
[00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:28.640]   Do you all remember episode 122
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:30.960]   where I spoke with chef David Chang
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:33.120]   about leveling up your cooking at home?
[00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:36.120]   If not, definitely go back and give it a listen.
[00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:40.060]   But one of his top hacks was using the microwave a lot more.
[00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:42.500]   I'll admit I was a skeptic at first,
[00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:45.360]   but after getting a full set of microwave cookware
[00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:48.000]   from Anyday, I am a total convert
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.080]   and I am so excited to be partnering with them
[00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:51.400]   for this episode.
[00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:54.440]   Anyday is glass cookware specially designed
[00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:57.680]   to make delicious food from scratch in the microwave.
[00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:01.040]   And honestly, using it feels like a kitchen cheat code
[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:05.040]   because it speeds up and simplifies the process so much.
[00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:07.680]   The cookware is 100% plastic free
[00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:10.620]   and you can cook, serve, store and reheat
[00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:13.780]   all in the same dish that happens to be dishwasher,
[00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:16.020]   freezer and oven safe too.
[00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:18.620]   And just last week, they worked with David Chang
[00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:21.800]   to launch the beautiful matte black IO collection.
[00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:24.100]   So you should definitely check that out.
[00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:27.420]   To get 15% off our new favorite cookware,
[00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:30.500]   go to allthehacks.com/anyday
[00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:33.620]   or use the code HACKS15 at checkout.
[00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:38.620]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/anyday for 15% off.
[00:43:38.620 --> 00:43:42.820]   Did you know that someone new gets impacted
[00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:45.540]   by identity theft every two seconds?
[00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:47.380]   It makes sense when there's so much
[00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:49.980]   of our personal information getting shared online
[00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:51.540]   without our consent.
[00:43:51.540 --> 00:43:55.460]   I found a listing for my dad on a site called Family Tree Now
[00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:59.420]   that had his name, age, address, phone number, email,
[00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:02.260]   past addresses and the names of his relatives.
[00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:06.860]   And that was just one of the 69 listings that had his info.
[00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:08.980]   Fortunately, instead of spending hours
[00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:10.820]   finding all the sites with his info
[00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:12.980]   and submitting the request to take it down,
[00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:16.220]   I got it all done in minutes with Delete.me from Abine
[00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:18.540]   and I am so excited to be partnering with them
[00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:19.500]   for this episode.
[00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:22.480]   Delete.me is an amazing service that will not just find
[00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:24.580]   and remove your personal information
[00:44:24.580 --> 00:44:27.340]   from over 500 data broker websites,
[00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:30.460]   but they'll continuously scan for new data that shows up
[00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:32.120]   and get that removed as well.
[00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:35.300]   On average, Delete.me finds and removes over 2000 pieces
[00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:37.940]   of data for a customer in their first two years.
[00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:41.800]   And to date, they've removed over 35 million pieces of data
[00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:42.740]   for their customers.
[00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:45.300]   So if you wanna get your personal information removed
[00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:47.300]   from all these listings on the internet,
[00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:50.340]   go to allthehacks.com/deleteme
[00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:54.860]   and get 20% off a plan for you or your entire family.
[00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:58.820]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/deleteme.
[00:44:58.820 --> 00:45:01.900]   I just wanna thank you, Quick, for listening to
[00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:03.380]   and supporting the show.
[00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:06.220]   Your support is what keeps this show going.
[00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:09.760]   To get all of the URLs, codes, deals, and discounts
[00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:14.240]   from our partners, you can go to allthehacks.com/deals.
[00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:17.580]   So please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:20.340]   I'm sure people will come back and say they disagree
[00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:23.940]   or they had better experiences with some of these or worse,
[00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:25.860]   but in general, when I talked to people
[00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:28.000]   and I read through lots of comments on forums
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.380]   and Reddit and everything,
[00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:31.100]   it seemed like all the carriers kind of fell
[00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:32.260]   into three buckets.
[00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:34.380]   There were your standard carriers, your GEICO,
[00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:36.660]   your Progressive, your State Farm.
[00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:39.100]   There were carriers that were still kind of mainstream,
[00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:41.860]   but people categorized as better or more premium.
[00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:46.580]   Travelers came up here, Safeco, Amica, USAA,
[00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:49.620]   and then there were actually the premium insurers.
[00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:53.420]   So these are carriers not just that will write coverage
[00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:54.900]   beyond what traditional covers do,
[00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:57.580]   but just have a much more high-end experience.
[00:45:57.580 --> 00:45:59.860]   Two of the bigger ones are Pure and Chubb,
[00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:02.540]   but other ones are Cincinnati, AIG,
[00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:05.260]   Nationwide Private Client, Hartford, et cetera.
[00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:08.020]   One thing to note is that a lot of them have minimums.
[00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:10.540]   So even if you had a home only worth a million dollars,
[00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:13.180]   some of them might write the limits to 3 million,
[00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:15.180]   so it's never gonna be a reasonable price.
[00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:17.020]   When I looked at the premium insurers,
[00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:21.540]   it was gonna be almost 30, 40% more to use any of them.
[00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:24.740]   And while I talked earlier about some of the things you get
[00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:26.660]   from those expensive, nice policies
[00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:30.420]   like guaranteed replacement or better, faster claims,
[00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:32.580]   use any repair shop, OEM parts,
[00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:35.100]   paying 30, 40% more just wasn't worth it for me.
[00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:37.100]   Also to do some research for this episode,
[00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:39.340]   I went and paid for Consumer Reports
[00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:41.140]   and I wanted to look at their data.
[00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:42.380]   When you look at home and auto,
[00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:45.460]   the top three carriers on both are the same.
[00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:48.460]   It's USAA, Amica, and NJM.
[00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:50.980]   And NJM, which is New Jersey Manufacturers,
[00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:53.900]   they definitely stood out as the top three rated
[00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:55.860]   on all different aspects.
[00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:58.700]   But a few of the ones that were below those top three
[00:46:58.700 --> 00:47:02.020]   that stood out a little bit on both auto and home
[00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:04.980]   were Chubb, Cincinnati, Auto Owners,
[00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:06.900]   Erie, and Country Financial.
[00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:08.100]   I looked at Chubb and Cincinnati
[00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:09.300]   and they were too expensive.
[00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:10.620]   I looked at a few of the others.
[00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:13.340]   Erie, for example, doesn't operate in California,
[00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:15.620]   but that's just save you some time from Consumer Reports.
[00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:17.940]   That doesn't mean that other carriers aren't great.
[00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:19.780]   I've heard lots of good things about Pure.
[00:47:19.780 --> 00:47:21.540]   I've actually heard lots of good things about Travelers,
[00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:23.620]   though Consumer Reports didn't think they were great.
[00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:25.420]   But I figured I'd just share, save you some time
[00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:29.300]   or save you the $39 a year to get access to those ratings.
[00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:30.380]   That's a lot of the carriers,
[00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:32.140]   but how do you actually go about doing this?
[00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:34.860]   And I wish that I could tell you it was easier,
[00:47:34.860 --> 00:47:36.940]   but some of these carriers,
[00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:38.780]   a lot of this kind of standard Geico,
[00:47:38.780 --> 00:47:40.100]   progressive, State Farm,
[00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:41.340]   you have to go direct to them
[00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:43.060]   and they don't work with brokers.
[00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:44.860]   And then a lot of the other carriers,
[00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:47.500]   like Travelers and Safeco and Pure and Chubb,
[00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:48.900]   they only work through brokers.
[00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:51.460]   So you can't go one place
[00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:53.660]   and get access to all of the policies.
[00:47:53.660 --> 00:47:55.620]   I did go to a couple brokers
[00:47:55.620 --> 00:47:58.020]   and I will say that, especially in California,
[00:47:58.020 --> 00:47:59.540]   I think nationwide,
[00:47:59.540 --> 00:48:01.660]   but all the insurers have very specific rates.
[00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:02.780]   So you're gonna get the same rate
[00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:04.660]   no matter which broker you work with.
[00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:06.340]   And like travel agents,
[00:48:06.340 --> 00:48:08.100]   the commissions are kind of baked in.
[00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:09.500]   And so I wouldn't worry about,
[00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:10.900]   oh, I don't wanna pay a broker's fee
[00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:13.020]   'cause that's just kind of built into the price
[00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:15.140]   and it's not really gonna cost you directly.
[00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:16.220]   I went to a few.
[00:48:16.220 --> 00:48:18.500]   If you need a recommendation, I'm happy to send one,
[00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:20.860]   but it might vary by state and where you live.
[00:48:20.860 --> 00:48:22.860]   And so I'd definitely reach out locally.
[00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:24.500]   So what I did was I went online
[00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:26.340]   and I tried to do the quotes where I could online
[00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:27.940]   'cause it was way faster.
[00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:30.820]   I focused on carriers that had good reviews
[00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:32.740]   and that were easy to get in front of.
[00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:35.980]   And then I found a broker who could reach out on my behalf
[00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:38.100]   and pull quotes for a few of the other companies.
[00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:41.060]   So the match was me doing it for most of the carriers
[00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:42.780]   and then working with one broker
[00:48:42.780 --> 00:48:44.820]   to look at something like Travelers, Safeco
[00:48:44.820 --> 00:48:46.860]   and some of the premium insurers.
[00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:48.900]   While I ultimately didn't even come close
[00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:51.500]   to doing something like Pure or Cincinnati or Chubb,
[00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:53.220]   I did wanna know what it costs,
[00:48:53.220 --> 00:48:54.740]   both for the purpose of this episode
[00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:56.220]   to understand the benefits.
[00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:59.020]   And a part of me doesn't know how to value that, right?
[00:48:59.020 --> 00:49:02.660]   How do I value the fact that I'll be able to send my car
[00:49:02.660 --> 00:49:04.920]   to any repair shop if there's an accident?
[00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:08.020]   I'm sure I could do some kind of statistical model of,
[00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:09.660]   okay, well, what's the likelihood it's gonna happen
[00:49:09.660 --> 00:49:12.180]   and what's the cost of it and is it worth it?
[00:49:12.180 --> 00:49:14.420]   But when I looked at it and it was gonna be an extra
[00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:17.660]   four to $5,000 a year for all our policies
[00:49:17.660 --> 00:49:20.300]   and require usually higher deductibles,
[00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:23.740]   I kind of took all of the super premium carriers off.
[00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:26.140]   And I'll keep in mind, I might mention carriers
[00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:28.500]   that I found to be expensive or not.
[00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:31.540]   And then I found plenty of people in forums
[00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:34.620]   or on Reddit that said, "That's so crazy.
[00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:36.420]   I compared USAA to State Farm
[00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:38.180]   and State Farm was so much cheaper."
[00:49:38.180 --> 00:49:39.580]   And then the other person's like, "That's crazy.
[00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:41.740]   For me, USAA is so much cheaper."
[00:49:41.740 --> 00:49:44.940]   It really varies so much state by state,
[00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:47.300]   person by person, zip code by zip code,
[00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:48.940]   type of car, et cetera.
[00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:51.420]   So I wouldn't read too far into me saying
[00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:53.180]   that I had a better price at one.
[00:49:53.180 --> 00:49:54.660]   I would definitely do your homework.
[00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:56.700]   There are some sites like Policy Genius
[00:49:56.700 --> 00:49:58.620]   that are brokers online that can save you the time
[00:49:58.620 --> 00:50:00.820]   of having to get on the phone and do a lot of this.
[00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:02.900]   I did try to do that, but for some reason,
[00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:05.060]   the page where you hit submit never loaded.
[00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:06.660]   So it didn't work so well for me.
[00:50:06.660 --> 00:50:10.300]   But I will say that at least in California,
[00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:14.380]   the value of bundling made this a much harder decision
[00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:17.140]   because I would look at the prices and say,
[00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:20.140]   "Wow, State Farm, for example, was really great,
[00:50:20.140 --> 00:50:22.900]   but their umbrella policy was twice as expensive.
[00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:24.620]   And USAA was really competitive,
[00:50:24.620 --> 00:50:26.660]   but their auto was twice as expensive."
[00:50:26.660 --> 00:50:28.220]   So I kept going through this and being like,
[00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:30.580]   "I just want to cherry pick from each of them,"
[00:50:30.580 --> 00:50:33.220]   except the cost of the homeowner's policy
[00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:37.300]   would go up 20% if you didn't bundle it with auto.
[00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:40.460]   So it was a very frustrating experience for me
[00:50:40.460 --> 00:50:42.900]   looking at all of these policies and saying,
[00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:44.300]   "I have to go with this company.
[00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:46.740]   I have to pay more for the auto policy
[00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:50.220]   because the savings for bundling makes up for it."
[00:50:50.220 --> 00:50:51.460]   I wish that wasn't the case.
[00:50:51.460 --> 00:50:52.980]   I wish I could pick and choose,
[00:50:52.980 --> 00:50:54.740]   but that's just the way it is.
[00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:58.220]   I actually looked at the total cost for each carrier
[00:50:58.220 --> 00:51:00.300]   instead of just policy by policy
[00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:04.300]   because that bundled savings ended up being so high on home.
[00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:06.380]   In California, best I can understand,
[00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:08.460]   there is no bundled savings for auto.
[00:51:08.460 --> 00:51:10.780]   So if you find a really great home price
[00:51:10.780 --> 00:51:12.020]   that doesn't require bundling,
[00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:13.700]   you get a little bit more flexibility,
[00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:17.060]   but it can make it hard for certain insurance carriers
[00:51:17.060 --> 00:51:18.660]   that don't offer everything.
[00:51:18.660 --> 00:51:20.660]   So for example, someone emailed in and asking
[00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:23.900]   why I didn't look at Tesla insurance for my Model 3.
[00:51:23.900 --> 00:51:27.660]   And the reality was it was a little bit less expensive.
[00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:30.180]   I was reasonably confident, though not 100%,
[00:51:30.180 --> 00:51:31.780]   that if I have Tesla insurance,
[00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:33.260]   they're at least not gonna make me go
[00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:34.940]   to some random repair shop
[00:51:34.940 --> 00:51:37.740]   and that they'll actually repair it at a Tesla dealership.
[00:51:37.740 --> 00:51:40.220]   But if I get Tesla insurance,
[00:51:40.220 --> 00:51:42.180]   I can't get any bundling discount
[00:51:42.180 --> 00:51:44.460]   and it's gonna raise the price of that homeowner's policy
[00:51:44.460 --> 00:51:46.740]   by 500 to $1,000 a year,
[00:51:46.740 --> 00:51:48.820]   which actually makes any discount
[00:51:48.820 --> 00:51:50.940]   from Tesla insurance not worth it.
[00:51:50.940 --> 00:51:53.240]   Ultimately, I looked at all the prices.
[00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:56.460]   I'm so close to the finish line, but not quite there.
[00:51:56.460 --> 00:52:00.780]   I'm waiting to hear back from one question on travelers.
[00:52:00.780 --> 00:52:02.280]   When you live in California,
[00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:06.160]   especially with being in proximity to places with wildfires
[00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:07.000]   and that kind of stuff,
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:08.900]   we're fortunately not in those zones,
[00:52:08.900 --> 00:52:11.140]   but it does require a lot of our quotes sometimes
[00:52:11.140 --> 00:52:13.820]   to go through underwriting to make sure it's all approved.
[00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:17.620]   So the process can be a 24, 48-hour turnaround.
[00:52:17.620 --> 00:52:21.620]   Ultimately, I think we'll end up at USAA or Travelers.
[00:52:21.620 --> 00:52:22.740]   That's my instinct,
[00:52:22.740 --> 00:52:26.700]   but it's gonna be close because GEICO right now
[00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:29.760]   is about $1,000 a year cheaper on auto,
[00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:31.820]   maybe because we've been there for a while,
[00:52:31.820 --> 00:52:33.380]   maybe because they're more generous
[00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:35.620]   with an international young driver.
[00:52:35.620 --> 00:52:38.940]   So I think it'll either be USAA or Travelers for home
[00:52:38.940 --> 00:52:41.420]   and then GEICO there or not,
[00:52:41.420 --> 00:52:43.180]   depending on whether the GEICO discount
[00:52:43.180 --> 00:52:46.420]   is better or worse than the bundling discount.
[00:52:46.420 --> 00:52:48.700]   Also, I don't know how to think about the value
[00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:50.180]   of having everything in one place.
[00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:51.940]   There's like this peace of mind
[00:52:51.940 --> 00:52:54.980]   that I wanted going into this process of,
[00:52:54.980 --> 00:52:57.240]   ah, it'd just be nice to have one insurance company
[00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:59.100]   that I could deal with for everything.
[00:52:59.100 --> 00:53:00.820]   And when it came down to it, it was like,
[00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:04.500]   do I wanna pay $800 a year to have that peace of mind?
[00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:06.820]   I'm sure if I went back and talked to Dan Martell,
[00:53:06.820 --> 00:53:10.500]   he would tell me I'm definitely not valuing my time at all
[00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:13.180]   and that I spent way too much time on this whole project.
[00:53:13.180 --> 00:53:15.660]   But whenever I spend time on this,
[00:53:15.660 --> 00:53:18.160]   I feel like I'm getting a lot of enjoyment,
[00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:19.620]   I'm getting a lot of satisfaction,
[00:53:19.620 --> 00:53:21.140]   but I'm also creating content
[00:53:21.140 --> 00:53:22.740]   that hopefully is valuable to a lot of you.
[00:53:22.740 --> 00:53:26.620]   So the leverage on my time isn't what I can do from it,
[00:53:26.620 --> 00:53:28.460]   but it's the satisfaction of knowing
[00:53:28.460 --> 00:53:29.820]   that hopefully lots of you listening
[00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:32.100]   are gonna save money or be better insured.
[00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:36.020]   And so I feel good about spending 50 hours on this project,
[00:53:36.020 --> 00:53:37.820]   which might only save me $1,000 a year,
[00:53:37.820 --> 00:53:40.380]   but hopefully will save tens or hundreds of thousands
[00:53:40.380 --> 00:53:41.940]   of dollars across everyone listening.
[00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:45.540]   So that is all the major policies that I price regularly
[00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:47.940]   that I just recently went through a process of.
[00:53:47.940 --> 00:53:50.220]   I would absolutely love if anyone listening to this
[00:53:50.220 --> 00:53:53.260]   has questions, thoughts, feedback, things to share,
[00:53:53.260 --> 00:53:54.820]   I'm gonna do a Q&A episode
[00:53:54.820 --> 00:53:57.160]   and I'm gonna share anything anyone here has heard.
[00:53:57.160 --> 00:53:59.160]   I know there are one-off situations
[00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:00.180]   that can be good or bad,
[00:54:00.180 --> 00:54:02.860]   but if you've had a really bad or a really great experience
[00:54:02.860 --> 00:54:04.780]   with a carrier, let me know,
[00:54:04.780 --> 00:54:06.380]   even if it's just a quick email,
[00:54:06.380 --> 00:54:08.420]   I'll share all the recap learnings
[00:54:08.420 --> 00:54:11.020]   that I've gotten from you all in the next episode.
[00:54:11.020 --> 00:54:13.740]   So definitely do that, chris@allthehacks.com.
[00:54:13.740 --> 00:54:16.100]   You can DM me on social anywhere as well.
[00:54:16.100 --> 00:54:18.660]   I also wanna touch on a few other types of insurance.
[00:54:18.660 --> 00:54:20.020]   So let's jump into it.
[00:54:20.020 --> 00:54:22.160]   Life insurance is one of those important things
[00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:26.100]   that I think can have a huge impact on your spouse,
[00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:27.500]   your family, your children,
[00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:30.020]   even your parents sometimes should something happen to you.
[00:54:30.020 --> 00:54:32.820]   So its primary goal is to replace the loss
[00:54:32.820 --> 00:54:35.580]   of your future income for anyone you leave behind.
[00:54:35.580 --> 00:54:37.780]   It can also help cover things like funeral expenses
[00:54:37.780 --> 00:54:38.780]   or pay off debt.
[00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:40.400]   And I think if you have young kids
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:42.060]   or anyone who really depends on you
[00:54:42.060 --> 00:54:43.760]   and your income to survive,
[00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:46.080]   it's really something you should consider.
[00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:47.780]   And when it comes to what kind,
[00:54:47.780 --> 00:54:50.380]   this is where it gets very confusing,
[00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:53.780]   but I have a very specific point of view, term life.
[00:54:53.780 --> 00:54:56.420]   It's a policy that has a limit for how long it's active,
[00:54:56.420 --> 00:54:58.660]   10, 20, 30 years, for example.
[00:54:58.660 --> 00:55:00.220]   If you pass away within that term,
[00:55:00.220 --> 00:55:03.180]   your beneficiaries get the face value of the policy,
[00:55:03.180 --> 00:55:06.300]   also called a death benefit, and it's usually tax-free.
[00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:08.820]   And if you pass after the term expires
[00:55:08.820 --> 00:55:11.380]   or you just stop paying your bills, they get nothing.
[00:55:11.380 --> 00:55:14.260]   So if it expires, why would you go with this
[00:55:14.260 --> 00:55:15.700]   when there's these other policies
[00:55:15.700 --> 00:55:18.020]   that are marketed as amazing savings vehicles
[00:55:18.020 --> 00:55:19.700]   that you can earn all this extra money
[00:55:19.700 --> 00:55:23.180]   and save compound tax-free permanent life,
[00:55:23.180 --> 00:55:24.580]   whole life, universal life,
[00:55:24.580 --> 00:55:27.220]   they all market themselves as offering you a benefit
[00:55:27.220 --> 00:55:30.300]   that lasts your whole life and helps you build wealth.
[00:55:30.300 --> 00:55:32.060]   But they have complex rules,
[00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:34.540]   they have high premiums and high fees,
[00:55:34.540 --> 00:55:37.620]   and I think you're almost always better off
[00:55:37.620 --> 00:55:40.060]   taking what you save with those lower premiums
[00:55:40.060 --> 00:55:42.740]   of a term policy and investing the difference
[00:55:42.740 --> 00:55:45.020]   in low-cost index funds yourself
[00:55:45.020 --> 00:55:48.380]   instead of trying to bundle together your life insurance
[00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:50.040]   and your investment savings.
[00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:52.180]   It's not always easy to find that advice.
[00:55:52.180 --> 00:55:54.140]   I think if you look in the right places, you'll get it.
[00:55:54.140 --> 00:55:56.220]   I'll link to a couple articles from NerdWallet
[00:55:56.220 --> 00:55:57.740]   and the White Coat Investor,
[00:55:57.740 --> 00:56:00.940]   the Reddit Personal Finance Group will say the same thing,
[00:56:00.940 --> 00:56:03.860]   but it's hard because permanent, whole,
[00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:07.540]   and universal life policies have such high commissions
[00:56:07.540 --> 00:56:08.700]   that there are so many people
[00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:10.380]   that make so much money selling it
[00:56:10.380 --> 00:56:13.940]   that it is worth all the marketing, all the conversations,
[00:56:13.940 --> 00:56:15.820]   and why it's very easy to find someone
[00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:17.660]   that will try to convince you that it's the best.
[00:56:17.660 --> 00:56:21.140]   But in my personal opinion, term life is great,
[00:56:21.140 --> 00:56:22.760]   and I think that's what I would focus on.
[00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:25.700]   As far as how much to get and for how long,
[00:56:25.700 --> 00:56:27.540]   you don't have to get just one policy.
[00:56:27.540 --> 00:56:29.820]   So a great hack here is called laddering
[00:56:29.820 --> 00:56:31.620]   or layering your policies.
[00:56:31.620 --> 00:56:34.220]   So if you wanna be able to replace your income
[00:56:34.220 --> 00:56:36.980]   until your children are 18,
[00:56:36.980 --> 00:56:38.660]   you're gonna need a lot less money.
[00:56:38.660 --> 00:56:40.860]   Let's say you have one child and they were just born.
[00:56:40.860 --> 00:56:42.100]   If you were to pass away today,
[00:56:42.100 --> 00:56:43.060]   you might need a lot more
[00:56:43.060 --> 00:56:45.260]   than if you were to pass away in 17 years.
[00:56:45.260 --> 00:56:47.960]   So you could get a 20-year policy for one amount
[00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:49.920]   and a 10-year policy for the other,
[00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:53.140]   knowing that by the time your child is 10,
[00:56:53.140 --> 00:56:55.700]   you're not gonna need as much life insurance.
[00:56:55.700 --> 00:56:56.700]   That might be different
[00:56:56.700 --> 00:56:58.340]   depending on how much money you have saved,
[00:56:58.340 --> 00:57:00.700]   whether your spouse works, there's a lot of questions.
[00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:02.180]   I'll link to a Policy Genius article
[00:57:02.180 --> 00:57:02.980]   that I thought was pretty good
[00:57:02.980 --> 00:57:05.300]   about explaining the laddering policy.
[00:57:05.300 --> 00:57:06.800]   Another thing that could be laddered,
[00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:08.080]   not just your children's ages,
[00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:10.460]   but maybe it's when your mortgage gets paid off,
[00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:13.100]   or maybe when you're eligible for retirement,
[00:57:13.100 --> 00:57:15.620]   or you can tap into your retirement accounts,
[00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:17.040]   your 401ks, your IRAs.
[00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:19.180]   That's generally my advice.
[00:57:19.180 --> 00:57:20.860]   If you're someone who's listening to this and thinks,
[00:57:20.860 --> 00:57:22.700]   "Oh my gosh, I have a permanent life policy
[00:57:22.700 --> 00:57:24.980]   or a whole life or a universal life."
[00:57:24.980 --> 00:57:26.140]   I don't think it's the end of the world,
[00:57:26.140 --> 00:57:27.940]   but I definitely would look into,
[00:57:27.940 --> 00:57:29.480]   and I'm not the expert here,
[00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:32.380]   what would it cost to cash in on that policy now
[00:57:32.380 --> 00:57:33.500]   and switch to term life?
[00:57:33.500 --> 00:57:35.940]   It's something to consider, but I'm not the expert.
[00:57:35.940 --> 00:57:37.860]   So I don't know whether that's always a good deal,
[00:57:37.860 --> 00:57:39.060]   never a good deal.
[00:57:39.060 --> 00:57:39.980]   I can't answer that.
[00:57:39.980 --> 00:57:41.760]   But if you don't have a policy now,
[00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:43.540]   I would definitely look at term life.
[00:57:43.540 --> 00:57:45.260]   I know when I went through this process
[00:57:45.260 --> 00:57:47.260]   of shopping for insurance policies,
[00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:50.060]   I actually priced out a ton of term life policies.
[00:57:50.060 --> 00:57:51.780]   And part of the reason that I ended up partnering
[00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:54.340]   with Fabric on the show as a sponsor
[00:57:54.340 --> 00:57:57.660]   is because I looked at their policies,
[00:57:57.660 --> 00:57:59.820]   I looked at their reviews, and I looked at their prices,
[00:57:59.820 --> 00:58:01.060]   and they were really competitive.
[00:58:01.060 --> 00:58:02.340]   They also had an A+ rating,
[00:58:02.340 --> 00:58:06.740]   so you can check them out at meetfabric.com/allthehacks.
[00:58:06.740 --> 00:58:08.820]   So that's definitely one option to look at.
[00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:11.460]   There's another great site called Term4Sale,
[00:58:11.460 --> 00:58:12.800]   the number four dot com.
[00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:17.340]   So term4sale.com, which has a bunch of information
[00:58:17.340 --> 00:58:19.860]   about various different term policies and prices, et cetera.
[00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:22.380]   So that's another place to look.
[00:58:22.380 --> 00:58:24.160]   The pricing isn't that variable,
[00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:27.580]   but it could be as little as a million dollars of coverage
[00:58:27.580 --> 00:58:29.740]   for a dollar a day, and it can go up from there
[00:58:29.740 --> 00:58:31.660]   depending on the term length you have.
[00:58:31.660 --> 00:58:34.420]   Funny enough, when I was comparing the cost of term life
[00:58:34.420 --> 00:58:36.680]   of a million dollars of coverage to pet insurance,
[00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:37.580]   which I'll cover later,
[00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:39.980]   it was much cheaper to get term life than pet insurance.
[00:58:39.980 --> 00:58:42.180]   So I find that interesting.
[00:58:42.180 --> 00:58:43.780]   I also got a great email, thank you,
[00:58:43.780 --> 00:58:46.940]   for writing in from someone who I don't wanna say their name
[00:58:46.940 --> 00:58:47.860]   'cause I don't wanna call them out,
[00:58:47.860 --> 00:58:49.540]   but they work at a big whole life company.
[00:58:49.540 --> 00:58:51.140]   And they definitely said,
[00:58:51.140 --> 00:58:53.940]   "I do not recommend whole life to the average person."
[00:58:53.940 --> 00:58:55.140]   They said, "If you're really wealthy
[00:58:55.140 --> 00:58:56.940]   and doing some estate planning tactics,
[00:58:56.940 --> 00:58:59.140]   there are some ways that you can use life insurance
[00:58:59.140 --> 00:59:01.260]   to avoid taxes and save money
[00:59:01.260 --> 00:59:03.240]   in a more tax efficient manner.
[00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:05.360]   But for basic financial security,
[00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:07.420]   they even work at a company that offers this product
[00:59:07.420 --> 00:59:08.580]   and would not recommend it."
[00:59:08.580 --> 00:59:11.260]   I'm not gonna get into the kind of advanced tactics
[00:59:11.260 --> 00:59:13.580]   of using a whole life and universal life
[00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:17.380]   in kind of estate planning, high net worth tax savings ways.
[00:59:17.380 --> 00:59:18.200]   But for the average person,
[00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:20.740]   I think it's probably not the right policy.
[00:59:20.740 --> 00:59:22.460]   Of course, I'm not an insurance expert.
[00:59:22.460 --> 00:59:24.420]   Do your own work, talk to a professional,
[00:59:24.420 --> 00:59:26.340]   but just please make that sure that professional
[00:59:26.340 --> 00:59:27.260]   doesn't make a commission
[00:59:27.260 --> 00:59:29.100]   selling you permanent whole or universal life.
[00:59:29.100 --> 00:59:31.280]   I'll touch briefly, like I said, on pet insurance.
[00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:32.860]   I don't have a strong opinion here,
[00:59:32.860 --> 00:59:34.120]   but I'll share what I learned.
[00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:36.300]   A lot of people seem to think that
[00:59:36.300 --> 00:59:38.980]   if you have an exotic animal that it requires special care,
[00:59:38.980 --> 00:59:40.180]   or maybe you have a breed
[00:59:40.180 --> 00:59:42.240]   that's really prone to health issues,
[00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:43.880]   it could be more important to others.
[00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:46.500]   The premiums, depending on what kind of coverage you want,
[00:59:46.500 --> 00:59:49.940]   it can be anywhere from 15 to $150 a month,
[00:59:49.940 --> 00:59:52.060]   depending on the age of your pet, their breed,
[00:59:52.060 --> 00:59:54.120]   the species, their health history.
[00:59:54.120 --> 00:59:56.100]   The older the pet, the higher it is.
[00:59:56.100 --> 00:59:59.860]   I've taken the path of self-insurance myself with our dog,
[00:59:59.860 --> 01:00:01.780]   who is about eight now.
[01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:04.700]   We've had years where we've spent $100 for a vet visit,
[01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:06.500]   and we've had years where we spent $1,000
[01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:07.980]   trying to diagnose an issue.
[01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:10.620]   In that $1,000 a year, I kind of thought,
[01:00:10.620 --> 01:00:12.300]   "Oh gosh, should I have gotten pet insurance?"
[01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:13.660]   I reconsidered.
[01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:16.100]   I actually saw a bunch of positive feedback
[01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:17.260]   for Lemonade's pet insurance.
[01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:18.180]   I priced it out.
[01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:19.300]   I thought about it more.
[01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:21.180]   Ultimately, we didn't do it.
[01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:23.900]   But I think that's because this is such a personal decision
[01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:26.100]   that really comes down to how much you'd be willing
[01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:28.060]   to spend on your pet for medical treatment.
[01:00:28.060 --> 01:00:29.700]   If that number is,
[01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:32.020]   if something were wrong with my dog or my cat,
[01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:35.260]   and I would spend anything, $50,000, if that's what it took,
[01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:37.180]   pet insurance might be a better fit for you.
[01:00:37.180 --> 01:00:39.100]   It's also worth noting that it's not always
[01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:41.020]   the kind of reimbursement style insurance.
[01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:42.780]   So you might have to pay for your services upfront
[01:00:42.780 --> 01:00:44.500]   and submit your claims.
[01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:46.980]   And depending on the cost of living where you live,
[01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:48.860]   the amount they cover for various things
[01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:49.900]   might not be that much.
[01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:52.020]   I know I just looked at one of these policies yesterday
[01:00:52.020 --> 01:00:54.540]   to brush up, and the amount that they reimbursed
[01:00:54.540 --> 01:00:57.380]   for vet visits was definitely less
[01:00:57.380 --> 01:00:59.540]   than the vet visit cost in the Bay Area.
[01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:01.380]   So a few things to keep in mind.
[01:01:01.380 --> 01:01:03.060]   There are a lot of things you can add on
[01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:05.580]   that I would just kind of maybe go look at some vet bills
[01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:07.780]   to try to decide whether they make sense.
[01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:09.820]   Some policies will cover preventative care.
[01:01:09.820 --> 01:01:12.580]   Some policies will cover routine emergency visits
[01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:14.380]   versus major surgeries.
[01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:16.340]   It can add up if you get that policy
[01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:18.140]   that I looked up for our dog with everything,
[01:01:18.140 --> 01:01:20.100]   preventative care, lower deductibles.
[01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:22.700]   It was almost $150 a month, which is quite expensive.
[01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:24.140]   If you have strong opinions or you've had good
[01:01:24.140 --> 01:01:25.820]   or bad experiences on pet insurance
[01:01:25.820 --> 01:01:27.540]   on any of these policies, let me know,
[01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:30.500]   'cause I wanna do a recap in the Q&A episode
[01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:33.260]   in a week or two, covering feedback from you all,
[01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:35.420]   because I've learned so much from everyone listening.
[01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:37.700]   So I'd love to get that added to this episode.
[01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:40.060]   I'll talk quickly about disability insurance.
[01:01:40.060 --> 01:01:43.300]   Anyone at any age can become disabled or unable to work.
[01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:45.540]   It could be from illness, it could be from injury.
[01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:47.860]   While I don't love this stat, it was the best I found.
[01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:52.500]   Before reaching the age of 67, if you're 20 now,
[01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:53.620]   there's a one in four chance
[01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:55.500]   that you might become disabled at some point.
[01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:56.620]   Now, is that at 66?
[01:01:56.620 --> 01:01:57.780]   Is that at 30?
[01:01:57.780 --> 01:01:58.700]   It doesn't know.
[01:01:58.700 --> 01:02:00.460]   I just think it's something to keep in mind
[01:02:00.460 --> 01:02:02.380]   that it might be more common than you think.
[01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:04.300]   That doesn't mean you'd be disabled your whole life.
[01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:06.420]   I know I had foot surgery once
[01:02:06.420 --> 01:02:09.340]   and I was gonna be out for six or eight weeks,
[01:02:09.340 --> 01:02:10.980]   and it turns out it was more tax efficient
[01:02:10.980 --> 01:02:13.460]   to go on short-term disability than to not.
[01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:14.540]   So I did that,
[01:02:14.540 --> 01:02:17.500]   but I probably would be included in that statistic.
[01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:19.500]   But there are a lot of circumstances
[01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:21.780]   where that situation of disability
[01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:24.100]   could have a huge impact on your financial life.
[01:02:24.100 --> 01:02:26.620]   And you wanna be covered should you have an accident
[01:02:26.620 --> 01:02:28.700]   or a sudden illness that would prevent you from working.
[01:02:28.700 --> 01:02:29.780]   So there's two types.
[01:02:29.780 --> 01:02:30.880]   There's short-term disability,
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:32.780]   which is usually up to six months,
[01:02:32.780 --> 01:02:35.880]   and long-term disability that can cover you for years
[01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:37.260]   or even until you retire,
[01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:39.860]   but usually has a waiting period of three to 12 months
[01:02:39.860 --> 01:02:40.700]   before it kicks in
[01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:43.060]   where short-term disability would be there.
[01:02:43.060 --> 01:02:45.540]   You might have some coverage through your employers
[01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:48.340]   or through a state fund like we have in California.
[01:02:48.340 --> 01:02:49.460]   While those funds might say
[01:02:49.460 --> 01:02:51.500]   they recover 60 to 80% of your income,
[01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:53.740]   they often have weekly or monthly caps
[01:02:53.740 --> 01:02:54.940]   that might result in them
[01:02:54.940 --> 01:02:57.900]   replacing a much smaller percentage of your income.
[01:02:57.900 --> 01:02:59.500]   So if those policies aren't enough
[01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:01.380]   and what you have from work isn't enough
[01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:03.380]   and people really depend on your income,
[01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:05.100]   it could be worth having a supplemental
[01:03:05.100 --> 01:03:07.100]   or even full policy on your own.
[01:03:07.100 --> 01:03:09.180]   If you have enough of an emergency fund
[01:03:09.180 --> 01:03:11.640]   to cover your full income for three to six months,
[01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:12.940]   which I generally recommend,
[01:03:12.940 --> 01:03:14.060]   you might be able to self-insure
[01:03:14.060 --> 01:03:15.740]   your short-term disability needs,
[01:03:15.740 --> 01:03:17.300]   or at least self-insure the difference
[01:03:17.300 --> 01:03:19.420]   between the coverage you have and your full income,
[01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:21.500]   whether that's from work or from the state.
[01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:23.160]   But unless you're financially independent,
[01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:25.100]   you probably won't be able to self-insure
[01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:26.580]   against the chance that you become disabled
[01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:28.660]   for a really long time.
[01:03:28.660 --> 01:03:30.260]   So if you don't have a policy through work,
[01:03:30.260 --> 01:03:31.620]   definitely look into
[01:03:31.620 --> 01:03:33.700]   whether this might be a good option for you.
[01:03:33.700 --> 01:03:35.620]   Look into what your state and your work offers
[01:03:35.620 --> 01:03:37.300]   and try to look at what you would need
[01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:39.220]   to kind of be comfortable until retirement,
[01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:42.300]   taking into account your spouse's income and all that.
[01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:44.460]   I did some research last year for my newsletter
[01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:46.580]   and a Guardian and MassMutual came up
[01:03:46.580 --> 01:03:50.180]   as two top providers for long-term disability,
[01:03:50.180 --> 01:03:52.320]   but I don't have any experience with either.
[01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:53.380]   It's also worth pointing out
[01:03:53.380 --> 01:03:56.420]   there is a social security disability insurance
[01:03:56.420 --> 01:03:59.260]   that comes from all the social security tax you pay
[01:03:59.260 --> 01:04:00.460]   from your paycheck each month.
[01:04:00.460 --> 01:04:02.260]   You do have to have paid into these services
[01:04:02.260 --> 01:04:03.900]   for a certain amount of time to use them,
[01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:07.160]   but usually that's 40 credits, which you get each quarter.
[01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:09.120]   So it's about 10 years of employment.
[01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:10.660]   You can always go to the social security website
[01:04:10.660 --> 01:04:12.060]   and see how many credits you've earned.
[01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:15.260]   But I will say that the maximum benefit you can receive
[01:04:15.260 --> 01:04:18.660]   is kind of in the three to $4,000 range per month.
[01:04:18.660 --> 01:04:19.700]   So depending on where you live,
[01:04:19.700 --> 01:04:22.300]   that might not be enough to cover your life,
[01:04:22.300 --> 01:04:23.900]   but you could also factor in
[01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:25.660]   whether you'd be willing to move
[01:04:25.660 --> 01:04:27.580]   or what kind of changes you'd be able to make
[01:04:27.580 --> 01:04:28.900]   in a situation like this.
[01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:30.220]   So that's something to think about.
[01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:32.900]   Last, I'll touch on travel insurance.
[01:04:32.900 --> 01:04:34.220]   In the past few years,
[01:04:34.220 --> 01:04:36.620]   airlines have been pushing travel insurance so hard
[01:04:36.620 --> 01:04:38.820]   that I feel like I've gotten lots of questions.
[01:04:38.820 --> 01:04:41.340]   And every time you check out from a website
[01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:42.300]   buying an airline ticket,
[01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:43.380]   it's like, "Do you want the travel insurance?
[01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:44.660]   Do you want the travel insurance?"
[01:04:44.660 --> 01:04:46.380]   Most of those travel insurances
[01:04:46.380 --> 01:04:48.500]   cover things like delayed loss bags,
[01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:50.540]   trips delays, cancellations, interruptions,
[01:04:50.540 --> 01:04:51.380]   that kind of stuff,
[01:04:51.380 --> 01:04:54.080]   maybe medical evacuation, rental car damage.
[01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:56.140]   Almost all of those are things that you get
[01:04:56.140 --> 01:04:58.180]   from a great travel credit card.
[01:04:58.180 --> 01:05:02.120]   So I'll link to an example of the guide to benefits
[01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:03.380]   for the Chase Sapphire Reserve,
[01:05:03.380 --> 01:05:05.940]   but you should definitely look at your travel card
[01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:08.380]   and see what kind of benefits those include.
[01:05:08.380 --> 01:05:10.420]   I don't think I've done a full episode.
[01:05:10.420 --> 01:05:11.260]   Maybe I should.
[01:05:11.260 --> 01:05:14.180]   Let me know if you want one on a guide to all the benefits.
[01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:15.540]   I know I've written a newsletter about it.
[01:05:15.540 --> 01:05:17.020]   I'll link to it in the show notes,
[01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:19.340]   but just walking through all the credit card benefits
[01:05:19.340 --> 01:05:20.380]   you might have,
[01:05:20.380 --> 01:05:22.120]   whether they need to be supplemented
[01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:24.980]   or whether they're enough, how to use them, et cetera.
[01:05:24.980 --> 01:05:27.060]   That's kind of how I think about a lot of the policies
[01:05:27.060 --> 01:05:29.500]   that are being sold as you're checking out from an airline.
[01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:31.780]   I've never accepted those policies,
[01:05:31.780 --> 01:05:34.240]   but policies worth considering are
[01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:35.740]   if your health insurance doesn't cover you
[01:05:35.740 --> 01:05:36.820]   when you're traveling abroad,
[01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:38.020]   definitely look at a policy
[01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:40.140]   that covers medical treatment abroad.
[01:05:40.140 --> 01:05:42.540]   If you're worried about getting stuck abroad
[01:05:42.540 --> 01:05:43.700]   with medical situations
[01:05:43.700 --> 01:05:46.760]   and you want something that will cover a flight back,
[01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:49.180]   you can get medical evacuation insurance.
[01:05:49.180 --> 01:05:50.980]   The policy I have gotten,
[01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:53.020]   and I did get during the pandemic,
[01:05:53.020 --> 01:05:55.060]   was a policy from Trawick.
[01:05:55.060 --> 01:05:57.180]   They have this policy called Safe Travels Voyager.
[01:05:57.180 --> 01:05:58.940]   I've purchased it a few times.
[01:05:58.940 --> 01:06:01.420]   It covers more than you will get
[01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:02.660]   if you have a circumstance
[01:06:02.660 --> 01:06:04.140]   that your credit card would cover.
[01:06:04.140 --> 01:06:06.020]   Things like if you need to quarantine somewhere,
[01:06:06.020 --> 01:06:07.180]   it'll cover your hotel.
[01:06:07.180 --> 01:06:10.420]   If you need to get back to the US, it'll often cover you.
[01:06:10.420 --> 01:06:12.460]   But if you really wanna get back to the US
[01:06:12.460 --> 01:06:14.700]   and you want like no questions asked,
[01:06:14.700 --> 01:06:16.260]   get me home immediately,
[01:06:16.260 --> 01:06:18.540]   there's a company called Kovac Global
[01:06:18.540 --> 01:06:20.320]   that is pretty expensive,
[01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:23.880]   somewhere on the order of like $600 per person for a trip,
[01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:26.260]   but they will charter you a private flight and get you home
[01:06:26.260 --> 01:06:29.100]   even if it's just testing positive for COVID.
[01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:30.900]   So that's something to consider.
[01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:33.020]   And then if you're doing a bunch of adventure activities,
[01:06:33.020 --> 01:06:35.380]   a lot of basic travel insurance policies,
[01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:37.780]   maybe even your health insurance policy might not cover you.
[01:06:37.780 --> 01:06:40.660]   In years past, I've used a company called World Nomads
[01:06:40.660 --> 01:06:42.020]   to cover those activities.
[01:06:42.020 --> 01:06:43.540]   I haven't done it recently,
[01:06:43.540 --> 01:06:45.300]   I think probably 'cause I haven't been doing as much
[01:06:45.300 --> 01:06:46.820]   rock climbing on our travels.
[01:06:46.820 --> 01:06:49.580]   And then last, if you're going on any kind of trip
[01:06:49.580 --> 01:06:50.500]   that's really expensive,
[01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:52.960]   I had a friend that went on a cruise to the Galapagos
[01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:55.060]   and their connecting flights
[01:06:55.060 --> 01:06:56.900]   made it such that they missed their flight.
[01:06:56.900 --> 01:06:58.300]   It was not a great circumstance.
[01:06:58.300 --> 01:06:59.540]   So if you're doing anything
[01:06:59.540 --> 01:07:01.860]   where it's a very expensive endeavor,
[01:07:01.860 --> 01:07:03.060]   like a Galapagos cruise,
[01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:04.860]   I would definitely double check
[01:07:04.860 --> 01:07:06.700]   that you have something to protect you
[01:07:06.700 --> 01:07:08.740]   in case your flight gets canceled or delayed
[01:07:08.740 --> 01:07:10.120]   and you can't make the boat,
[01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:11.820]   or something happens, you get sick,
[01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:14.540]   whether that's your credit card policy or another policy,
[01:07:14.540 --> 01:07:16.700]   you'd really not wanna miss the departure
[01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:17.980]   of a very expensive trip.
[01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:20.180]   So that's all the policies I wanted to cover
[01:07:20.180 --> 01:07:21.220]   for this episode.
[01:07:21.220 --> 01:07:23.300]   I know that's a lot of information.
[01:07:23.300 --> 01:07:25.540]   Maybe I'll put together a recap newsletter.
[01:07:25.540 --> 01:07:26.740]   I know I've done two in the past
[01:07:26.740 --> 01:07:27.820]   that I'll link to in the show notes
[01:07:27.820 --> 01:07:29.740]   that had a good amount of this information,
[01:07:29.740 --> 01:07:31.580]   but I really hope it was helpful.
[01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:33.300]   I'll just recap some of these tips.
[01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:34.940]   So definitely shop around,
[01:07:34.940 --> 01:07:38.140]   definitely read through the policy terms and understand them.
[01:07:38.140 --> 01:07:39.620]   Definitely consider whether it makes sense
[01:07:39.620 --> 01:07:41.080]   to up your deductibles.
[01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:42.720]   That is something that I think I've lowered
[01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:43.920]   a lot of my insurance costs
[01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:45.120]   by getting more comfortable
[01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:48.060]   with just setting aside some money in an emergency fund
[01:07:48.060 --> 01:07:51.300]   instead of having to rely on a low deductible.
[01:07:51.300 --> 01:07:53.580]   And definitely document everything in your house
[01:07:53.580 --> 01:07:54.520]   just in case.
[01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:55.700]   And finally, like I said,
[01:07:55.700 --> 01:07:57.480]   I hope we never have any of these issues.
[01:07:57.480 --> 01:08:00.140]   I hope you don't have a car accident or a flooded basement,
[01:08:00.140 --> 01:08:02.180]   but realistically these things happen.
[01:08:02.180 --> 01:08:04.940]   So I hope that this episode was helpful.
[01:08:04.940 --> 01:08:06.660]   I hope that you picked up a lot of tips.
[01:08:06.660 --> 01:08:09.220]   I hope that you can use it to protect yourself adequately
[01:08:09.220 --> 01:08:10.320]   and save some money.
[01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:13.280]   Thank you so much for listening.
[01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:15.740]   If you found this valuable, send it to a friend.
[01:08:15.740 --> 01:08:17.680]   The highest praise that you could give me
[01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:19.000]   for any of the work I'm doing
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.040]   is to help bring new people to the podcast.
[01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:23.500]   So if you know someone that wants to save money
[01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:25.420]   or adequately insure themselves,
[01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:28.000]   send them this episode, tell them to have a listen,
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.680]   tell them to reach out if they have questions.
[01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:31.140]   I would love to be helpful
[01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:33.180]   and find ways to help you all save more
[01:08:33.180 --> 01:08:34.400]   and be better insured.
[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:35.240]   So that's it.
[01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:36.100]   Thank you for listening.
[01:08:36.100 --> 01:08:37.340]   I will see you next week.
[01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:40.760]   (upbeat music)
[01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:43.500]   (birds chirping)
[01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:50.120]   [ silence ]
