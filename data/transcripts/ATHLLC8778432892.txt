[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.240]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.040]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.160]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins,
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.600]   and today I wanna do a deep dive on insurance.
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.080]   I've thought a lot about insurance
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.880]   and even written a few newsletters,
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.240]   but after going through the process
[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.560]   to redo most of our policies the last few weeks,
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.280]   I thought now would be the perfect time for this episode.
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.420]   So I'm gonna cover how I ran a process
[00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.920]   to save as much as possible on our insurance
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.660]   while I was still making sure I had good coverage.
[00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:30.880]   I'm gonna talk about the policies
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.660]   I've been focusing on recently,
[00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.120]   which include home, auto, umbrella, and personal articles,
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.000]   but I'm also gonna cover renters, life, disability,
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.420]   long-term care, pet, and even travel insurance.
[00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.600]   Consider this episode a one-stop shop
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.760]   for me to share the learnings
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.200]   from hundreds of hours of conversations and research.
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.920]   And I really hope you enjoy it, but more importantly,
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.680]   I hope it helps you save money and get the right coverages.
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.920]   But I should remind you all
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.560]   that I am not an insurance professional
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.520]   and all my research was mostly done for California,
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.400]   which may be different than your state,
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.240]   so please do your own research as well,
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.860]   but let's get into it right after this.
[00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.320]   Okay, before we get started,
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.000]   I just wanna talk about why this is so top of mind for me,
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.980]   just so you guys have some context.
[00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.360]   So a few things have been happening
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.980]   all at the same time, really.
[00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.920]   One, our new au pair, Stefania, is from Italy
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.840]   and we're adding her to our auto policy
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.800]   so that she can drive with our car
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.240]   and take our kids to museums and that kind of thing.
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.680]   That means that I'm gonna be adding a 24-year-old
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.120]   to our policy, which is gonna have a huge impact on rates,
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.460]   and so shopping around actually really, really matters.
[00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.160]   But also, I've talked in the past
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.920]   about how this year is really a year
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.920]   of consolidation for me,
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.560]   and so I've already done this
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.400]   with banking and investing accounts,
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.160]   closing things down, trying to get them all in one place,
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.160]   but I hadn't done this with insurance.
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.640]   And honestly, I'm having second thoughts
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.280]   being almost at the finish line now
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.240]   about how valuable it really is
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.800]   to get all your insurance policies at one place
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.240]   from a convenience standpoint.
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.200]   I'll talk about bundling and why it might be worth it
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.800]   from a pricing standpoint,
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:07.640]   but at the end of the day,
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.760]   if I can save 500 or $700 a year
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.260]   and have to pay bills to two different insurance companies,
[00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.560]   does it really matter?
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.280]   So I'll come back to that,
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.680]   but there are a couple reasons
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.960]   why I think this is important,
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.360]   even if there's not something like that
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.620]   going on in your life.
[00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.360]   First off, I was reading this stat
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.440]   that 76% of consumers who shopped saved money
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.000]   when they started shopping for new insurance.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.280]   So if you like saving money,
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.680]   which if you're listening to this podcast, I assume you do,
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.700]   you should definitely be shopping for insurance,
[00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.060]   at least on a regular basis.
[00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.640]   That doesn't mean every week or every month,
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.840]   maybe every year or two.
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.840]   The other thing is things change.
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.400]   Your home value changes,
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.600]   the amount of miles you drive, your car changes.
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.880]   So I think there might be things happening in your life
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.920]   that make it worth re-evaluating,
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.280]   if not your insurance carrier,
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.520]   at least what your coverage is.
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.280]   But I wanna point out that this is not all just about price.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.440]   I've read hundreds of Reddit comments
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.800]   from people about their claims experiences
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.020]   with different carriers.
[00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.640]   Some of those comments were written by attorneys
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.640]   who actually fight these insurance companies,
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.600]   people who've had to go through the process,
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.300]   and it seems like a big component that keeps coming out
[00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.920]   is that you get what you pay for.
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.920]   Now, I have some specific examples of this,
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.120]   but at the same time,
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.540]   I wanna make sure everyone also knows
[00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.740]   that insurance companies are heavily regulated.
[00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.780]   So while one insurer might be more generous
[00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.040]   with the cash value of your car
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.560]   or make the claims process a lot less work or hassle,
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.120]   I generally am not worried that a carrier
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.460]   might not actually pay out on a claim.
[00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:31.400]   And in California,
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.880]   as long as your policy is with an admitted carrier,
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.160]   and you'd probably know if it wasn't
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.860]   'cause you had to sign something agreeing
[00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.480]   that you know they're not admitted,
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.480]   the state actually provides a backstop
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.660]   if the carrier were to fail financially.
[00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.120]   So when I say you get what you pay for,
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.280]   yes, that might mean an easier process,
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.780]   better customer service, faster payout,
[00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.200]   but it could also be the way the policy is written
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.480]   or the features it includes
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.120]   or even some of the extra features you can add on.
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.040]   For example, on homeowner's insurance,
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.440]   it might be whether your policy even includes coverage
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.520]   for water backing up in your house.
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.900]   With Lemonade, it's not included by default.
[00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:04.820]   It might be included,
[00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.700]   but limited to only 10% of your home coverage amount,
[00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.640]   which is the most common I've seen,
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.680]   or from some premium carriers,
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.640]   it might actually be covered
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.120]   up to the entire coverage level of your home,
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.280]   which is less common,
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.680]   but obviously a much better, more comprehensive coverage.
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.520]   On auto, most auto policies
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.480]   will offer some type of rental car coverage
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.660]   in case you can't drive your car because it's in the shop,
[00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.360]   but a lot of them have coverage
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.360]   that's like $30 or $50 max per day, up to $1,500 total.
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.400]   But some carriers like USAA
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.420]   will not only let you pick the vehicle type,
[00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.520]   so you can ensure you have a large SUV
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.080]   to replace your large SUV, which might really matter,
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.840]   but they might not have a cap.
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.040]   They might not have a limit
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.320]   to how many days you can rent a car.
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.080]   So those are some examples
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.200]   of why you get what you pay for
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.400]   might be a little different,
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.160]   but I will come back to all the features that I found
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.960]   when I talk about each type of policy.
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.680]   I just wanna give you a quick idea
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.600]   of what I'm thinking about
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:01.560]   when I talk about something
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.480]   that might be a higher quality policy
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.620]   and why it's not about
[00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.560]   whether you're actually going to get paid,
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.020]   and it might be about other things.
[00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.760]   So let's jump in first and start with auto.
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.240]   According to the Association
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.000]   for Safe International Road Travel,
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.320]   about 4.4 million Americans
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.800]   are involved in a traffic accident
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.560]   that requires medical attention.
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.900]   So there's obvious reasons
[00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.560]   why you might wanna ensure your car and your health,
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.340]   but that also doesn't even touch on the cost
[00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.200]   that you have to take off work.
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.360]   You might need to rent a car.
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.160]   You might have litigation expenses.
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.240]   So in my opinion,
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.720]   and I think almost everyone's,
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.620]   car insurance is a must-have.
[00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.040]   But before I talk about ways to save,
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.240]   let's do a brief run-through
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.400]   of the major components of auto coverage,
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.440]   because even after doing this multiple times,
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.520]   I still come back to it.
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.840]   I wanna make sure I understand it every year.
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.440]   So let's start with liability.
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.840]   There's usually two components of it.
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.400]   There's bodily injury and property damage,
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.160]   the first being if you injure a person,
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.360]   and the second being if you cause damage
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.720]   to a car or something else.
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.700]   So that's one thing in many states,
[00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.160]   if not all, it's required,
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.020]   and you absolutely need it.
[00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.740]   There's also uninsured, underinsured motorists,
[00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:07.960]   which is if you have an accident
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.320]   with someone who doesn't actually have enough coverage
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.880]   for your car or for any injuries that are caused to you,
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.480]   the limits on what you need to have in a lot of states
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:19.560]   and what you can get away with for liability are very low.
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.600]   So for example, in California,
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.080]   the minimum liability insurance requirements
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.640]   are $15,000 for injury or death to one person,
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.000]   30,000 for injury or death to more than one person,
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.560]   and 5,000 for damage to property.
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.280]   So if you're driving around with a car
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.560]   and it's worth more than $5,000,
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.640]   it's possible that someone could hit your car
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.520]   and only have liability coverage
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.660]   for the property they caused damage to up to $5,000.
[00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.960]   So I think uninsured and underinsured motorists
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.400]   is pretty important,
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.200]   especially if you're driving around a car
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.400]   that's worth more than your state minimums.
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.740]   Comprehensive coverage is optional,
[00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:56.280]   usually required if you have a loan on the vehicle,
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.200]   but that covers when you're not driving.
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.640]   It covers the vehicle, if it's stolen,
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:04.000]   if there's a fire, vandalism, someone keys your car,
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.220]   and then there's collision,
[00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:08.740]   which is for the value of the car in an accident,
[00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:10.100]   regardless of who's at fault,
[00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:13.240]   if you hit a car or an object or something like that.
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.560]   Both of those are usually required if you have a loan
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.500]   because your lender wants to make sure
[00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.660]   that you can collect the value of the car if it's totaled
[00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.260]   and you're not gonna be underwater.
[00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.300]   And in fact, if you have a really high loan value,
[00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:24.660]   like 100% of the value of the car,
[00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:26.980]   you might actually need a gap insurance coverage
[00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:30.020]   just in case the value of the car when it's totaled
[00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:31.860]   is less than the amount you owe.
[00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:33.580]   And then last, there's medical payments,
[00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:35.180]   which covers you and your passengers
[00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:36.860]   and your car's medical costs.
[00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:38.420]   And you'll notice if you look at your policy,
[00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:39.540]   it's usually not that much.
[00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:41.940]   Could be $1,000, $5,000, $10,000.
[00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:43.700]   It's usually just to cover the deductibles
[00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:45.740]   and the co-pays for your health insurance.
[00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:47.340]   There's also a bunch of extra features
[00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:48.300]   and stuff that I'll get to,
[00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.720]   but I'm gonna talk broadly about how I think about this.
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.020]   So the first thing is that you really wanna make sure
[00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:54.620]   you're covered adequately.
[00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:57.140]   In fact, people seem to have such a problem
[00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:00.160]   deciding what adequate is that some insurers,
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.380]   like State Farm, at least in California,
[00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:04.420]   won't let you price a policy online.
[00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:06.220]   The message I've heard from talking to a State Farm agent
[00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:07.740]   is that there were just too many people
[00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:10.380]   buying policies that didn't adequately cover them.
[00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:11.900]   And then when they get in an accident,
[00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:13.500]   they try to blame the insurance company
[00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:15.160]   for letting them have a coverage
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.660]   that was lower than they needed.
[00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:19.520]   So how do you actually pick the right coverage?
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.260]   This is gonna be a really personal decision.
[00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:22.980]   It's gonna depend on a lot of factors,
[00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:25.400]   like your net worth and your comfort with risk.
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.820]   But I will say on the liability front,
[00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:30.460]   you probably wanna make sure that your net worth
[00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:33.220]   and even maybe your earning potential is protected
[00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:36.260]   because what you don't want is to get in an accident,
[00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.980]   cause damages to a person or a vehicle,
[00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:40.300]   and not have enough coverage
[00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:41.980]   such that they can come after you.
[00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:43.320]   So someone could sue you,
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.580]   they could sue you for what you have in your bank account,
[00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:48.820]   your investments, your property, any of your assets.
[00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.340]   And in some states, they can also sue you
[00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:52.120]   for your future earnings potential.
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:55.860]   So I would be making sure that you have all of that covered.
[00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:58.220]   But if that total amount of your net worth
[00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:01.240]   is over 250 or $300,000,
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.940]   then I would not actually focus
[00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:04.680]   on trying to increase your coverage
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:07.100]   on your liability for your auto policy.
[00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:09.700]   I would actually focus on getting an umbrella policy,
[00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:11.740]   and I think it'll be a lot less expensive,
[00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:13.800]   and it'll be a lot more broadly applicable.
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.100]   I'll cover that a little bit later,
[00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:17.020]   but just something to keep in the back of your mind.
[00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:18.840]   When it comes to comprehensive and collision,
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:19.720]   it's actually optional.
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.060]   So if you've paid off your car
[00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:23.140]   and the car is very inexpensive,
[00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:24.600]   it might not make sense to you,
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.140]   but we have a Vespa,
[00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:27.420]   and the value of the Vespa
[00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:30.060]   is probably under $1,000 at this point.
[00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:32.540]   So for that, I only have liability coverage.
[00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:34.820]   I don't have any comprehensive or collision coverage,
[00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:37.260]   because I just think at the end of the day,
[00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.540]   having to make a claim on that Vespa
[00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:42.560]   that might impact my rates in the future
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:46.300]   for hundreds of dollars of loss is probably not worth it.
[00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:47.420]   On the medical payment stuff,
[00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:48.820]   I would say just make sure you have enough
[00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:49.860]   that you think you can cover
[00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:51.740]   the health insurance deductibles
[00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:54.480]   for your family or whoever's in the car.
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.480]   And then, like I said, on the uninsured motorist,
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:58.200]   if you have collision protection,
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.240]   you're kind of gonna be covered
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.880]   in case someone hits your car and isn't covered enough.
[00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:04.000]   So it's not the end of the world.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.620]   And if you have health insurance,
[00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:06.460]   you might be thinking,
[00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:08.160]   "Oh, well, at the end of the day,
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.000]   all I'm gonna have to do if I have problems with my health
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.760]   to go to the doctor is cover my co-pays or my deductibles."
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:16.380]   And most people probably have that much insurance.
[00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:18.360]   But what if you can't work?
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:20.800]   What if you have to take a bunch of time off work?
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.440]   What if you have a permanent injury?
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.160]   Your health insurance might cover the treatment,
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.000]   but it won't go beyond that.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.460]   And adding this to your policy is not that expensive.
[00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:29.600]   So for our policy,
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.480]   adding the exact same coverage
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:32.960]   for uninsured, underinsured motorists
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:35.420]   as we have for our own liability coverage
[00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:37.400]   is less than 5% of the cost of the policy.
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:38.800]   So for me, it was an easy thing to add on.
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.540]   I think there's two states that require it,
[00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:42.480]   but in general, it's an optional policy.
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.560]   So that's the coverages.
[00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.980]   But when it comes to the prices, it's kind of crazy.
[00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:47.200]   When I was looking at homeowners,
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:51.120]   it was like 10 to 20% variability across different carriers.
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.160]   But when it came to auto,
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.360]   I remember as soon as we first got our Tesla,
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.440]   the difference between GEICO and State Farm
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.280]   was like 2X the price.
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:00.120]   And even right now,
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:02.280]   when I'm looking at insuring both of our cars,
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:04.140]   for me, my wife, the au pair,
[00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:07.660]   the quotes ranged from $3,000 to $6,000 a year
[00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:09.920]   for comparable coverage for everything.
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.940]   So it's really important when you're doing this
[00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:14.400]   to also make sure you're comparing apples to apples.
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:17.940]   For the most part, the policies are about the same.
[00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:20.880]   There are some carriers where the liability limit
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:24.320]   is 300, 500 versus 250, 500.
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:25.160]   But for the most part,
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.480]   it's pretty easy to get apples to apples.
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:29.120]   There are a few places like rental car coverage
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.920]   and a few extra optional features
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.420]   that you might not be able to have.
[00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:35.480]   So for me, when I'm comparing, I turn those features off.
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:37.560]   I make note that those carriers have it.
[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.400]   So I might decide to go with a different carrier
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:41.280]   because they have some extra features,
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:43.400]   but I wanna make sure I'm comparing price fairly.
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.440]   So the deductibles are for your comprehensive
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:46.280]   and your collision coverage.
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:47.560]   So assuming you have that,
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.940]   you get to decide how much you wanna have to put
[00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:52.440]   out of pocket before your insurance kicks in.
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.640]   So a big factor of this is how much emergency savings
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:57.840]   you have set aside and how willing you are
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.640]   to actually make a claim.
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:00.480]   For the most part,
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.780]   when you're making a claim on your auto insurance,
[00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:04.840]   you can probably expect that your rates,
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.000]   if they don't rise right away,
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.840]   might rise at the change of the next renewal.
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:10.120]   And so you ask yourself,
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.760]   for a while I had a $250 deductible
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:14.400]   and then our window got broken into
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:17.000]   and it was gonna cost $500 to replace the window.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.720]   And I thought, okay, well, if I pay out of pocket,
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.080]   I'm gonna spend $500.
[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:22.520]   But if I file a claim,
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:25.080]   I'm gonna spend $250 for the deductible
[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:27.280]   and the insurance company will cover the other 250.
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:31.200]   But now I have a claim on my insurance history
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.400]   and I've heard very mixed feedback
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:35.320]   on whether a comprehensive claim like that
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:36.720]   will affect your rates or not,
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.400]   or how big of an effect it had.
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:41.160]   But for me, I ended up not making the claim
[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.220]   because I didn't want the insurance rates to go up
[00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:46.060]   because even a five, 10% change in your insurance rates
[00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:49.980]   might be more, especially over a handful of years,
[00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:53.140]   than the actual savings you'd have right now.
[00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:54.980]   So for us, we actually raised our deductibles
[00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:57.220]   to all be $1,000, which yes,
[00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:58.740]   it means that if we're in an accident,
[00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:00.080]   if we need to repair the car,
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.620]   the first $1,000 is coming out of our pockets,
[00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:06.240]   but it brought the policy costs down a few hundred dollars
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:09.140]   a year, which means if we're not having an accident
[00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:10.720]   every couple of years,
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:12.500]   we're actually gonna save money in the long run.
[00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:15.580]   And fortunately, I'm knocking on the wood of my desk,
[00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:16.820]   we have not had an accident
[00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:18.020]   and we have not had to make a claim
[00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:19.940]   for almost probably 10 years.
[00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:23.660]   So given that, it actually has been a good savings for us.
[00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:25.380]   Another really important thing to track
[00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:26.620]   when you're trying to figure out how to save,
[00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:29.740]   especially in light of the post-pandemic world
[00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:31.420]   where a lot of us can work from home,
[00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:34.860]   is changing your mileage that you report on your policies.
[00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:37.180]   So if you don't drive as much as the average person,
[00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:40.020]   which is like 10 to 12,000 miles a year,
[00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:42.060]   you could actually tell your insurance company,
[00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:44.860]   please price this number of miles a year.
[00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:46.860]   And some insurance companies offer a device
[00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:47.940]   that tracks that,
[00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:49.740]   some just require that you report
[00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:51.720]   your odometer reading every year.
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.680]   But when we changed ours, which we don't drive a lot,
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:58.380]   we're at 3,500 miles for one car, 5,000 for another,
[00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:00.820]   the policy prices went way, way down.
[00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:03.180]   So make sure that if you're not driving a lot,
[00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:04.820]   you can actually track this.
[00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:07.460]   If you don't know where you're at, one tip here,
[00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:10.340]   if you have any service records for your vehicle,
[00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:11.820]   you can go back and look at them
[00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:14.760]   and they usually put in your odometer reading
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:16.380]   when you go in for service.
[00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:18.100]   So you should be able to go back and look,
[00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:21.060]   oh, if two years ago, your odometer read something,
[00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:24.220]   now two years later, it's only 5,000 miles more,
[00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:26.980]   then you're only driving the car 2,500 miles a year.
[00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:28.580]   And you could save a lot of money
[00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:32.300]   if your policy is priced at you driving 12,000 miles a year.
[00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:34.580]   Another way to save if you have the cashflow
[00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:37.300]   is that for a lot of carriers paying monthly
[00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:39.260]   comes with a little bit of an extra fee.
[00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:42.220]   So if you pay upfront in full, you might save that.
[00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:43.420]   And also when it comes to payments,
[00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:44.920]   some carriers give you a discount
[00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:46.480]   if you sign up for auto pay.
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.180]   So when I was talking with USAA,
[00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:49.720]   they told me depending on the state you live in,
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:51.560]   you can get up to 5% off your policy
[00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:53.960]   if you enroll in automatic payments
[00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.800]   and they don't charge a fee for doing things monthly.
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.880]   So it was like a double win,
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:00.760]   except they said it's not eligible in California,
[00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:02.180]   but it's 5% in Florida.
[00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:04.120]   So if you're in Florida, that's a great option.
[00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:07.400]   And also if you have a big insurance bill,
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:09.960]   one great thing is that if you pay in full,
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:11.680]   you can time that really nicely
[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:13.120]   with a credit card signup bonus
[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.380]   that you need to hit a minimum spend right away.
[00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:16.940]   So that's something.
[00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:19.260]   In some states also, not California,
[00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.300]   but insurance companies charge less
[00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:22.620]   if you have good credit,
[00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:25.740]   or if you take a driving course or different things
[00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:26.580]   depending on your record.
[00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:28.260]   So when you're going through your policy,
[00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.260]   ask your insurance agent or ask people,
[00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:31.520]   are there things that I can do?
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:32.960]   Is this being factored in?
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:34.620]   If your credit was being factored in,
[00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:36.160]   then it might be worth spending time there.
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:39.260]   If taking a driving course can drop your limits,
[00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.000]   it might be worth the cost depending on how much that costs.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.800]   There are also discounts if you have anti-theft devices,
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:48.120]   tracking devices like OnStar and LoJack
[00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:49.480]   and that kind of stuff.
[00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:51.160]   I think it's always worth finding out
[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:52.280]   what that discount would be
[00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:53.920]   before you go and install these things.
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:55.660]   A lot of them come with monthly service fees
[00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:57.760]   that might not actually make up for the savings.
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:00.040]   And then finally, if a student is on your policy,
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:02.600]   maybe your child, if they have good grades
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:04.480]   or are enrolled as a full-time student,
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:06.160]   sometimes you can get deals there.
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:07.320]   So that's a lot of the savings
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:08.760]   and the ways to think about it.
[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:09.600]   I'm gonna talk a little bit
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.260]   about some of the extra coverages
[00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.100]   that you can find on these policies
[00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:14.700]   and just how I've thought about them.
[00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:16.620]   So one is ride share coverage.
[00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:17.860]   If you're driving for Lyft or Uber,
[00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:20.080]   you absolutely should have this to make sure you're covered.
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.760]   Rental car coverage.
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:23.180]   This is one where you've got to decide
[00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:25.480]   how important is it that I have another car?
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:28.040]   If you have three cars and one of them's in the shop
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:29.740]   and you're not gonna need to borrow a car,
[00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:31.660]   then it's probably not worth paying for this.
[00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:33.180]   But if you have a big family
[00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:35.420]   and you only have one car that fits all of you,
[00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:37.540]   it might be worth having enough coverage
[00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:40.040]   for a rental car on that specific car
[00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:41.880]   so that you can rent a comparable car
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:43.240]   and be able to go places
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:44.960]   without needing to drive two vehicles.
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:46.320]   Towing is another one.
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:48.040]   So if you already have AAA,
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:49.440]   maybe you don't need to be paying
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:52.180]   your car insurance carrier also for towing coverage
[00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:53.440]   and you might be able to waive that.
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:54.280]   But if you don't,
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:56.200]   I know having been in a situation
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.440]   where we have a flat tire
[00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:58.520]   and we needed to call a tow truck
[00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:00.440]   and we actually didn't have the coverage,
[00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:01.780]   it was quite frustrating.
[00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:05.600]   One simple trick here is I think most insurance companies,
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:08.340]   even USA has a couple day waiting period,
[00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:10.220]   but I believe that Lyft Pink,
[00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:12.020]   which is like the subscription service
[00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:13.660]   that sits on top of Lyft,
[00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:14.820]   comes with towing coverage
[00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:16.580]   and can be activated immediately.
[00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:18.060]   So if you're in a bind
[00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:19.620]   and you don't have any towing coverage,
[00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:22.660]   maybe activate Lyft Pink and schedule a tow.
[00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:23.700]   There's another coverage
[00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:26.580]   that so far I've only seen with USAA
[00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:29.060]   called car replacement assistance,
[00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:31.780]   which basically says that if your car is totaled,
[00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:34.020]   they'll just give you an extra 20%
[00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:36.280]   on whatever the value of the car is.
[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:39.200]   And that can help with getting a new car
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:40.540]   that's maybe a little more expensive
[00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:42.080]   because your car's depreciated
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:43.760]   because it's obviously been driven.
[00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:45.360]   It could help you upgrade your car.
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.480]   It could help if there's a gap in the coverage
[00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:48.400]   and how much you owe
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.000]   and you didn't have gap insurance.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.520]   It's not the cheapest coverage,
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:56.520]   can be anywhere from 10, 20 to $100 or more every six months.
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:00.500]   But my sister-in-law actually got in an accident
[00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:01.520]   that someone else caused,
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:03.520]   totaled her car in the middle of the pandemic
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:05.440]   when cars were really, really expensive.
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:07.800]   And without that extra 20%,
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:09.640]   she wouldn't have even been able to replace her car
[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:11.580]   with a used car that was comparable.
[00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:14.280]   So she was so excited that they had that coverage
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.880]   because it was what enabled them to replace their car
[00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:19.000]   and not have to go out of pocket for that cost.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.320]   Then as far as what might vary between different carriers
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:23.920]   and things you might wanna ask about,
[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:26.600]   some of the higher value carriers will do things like
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:30.100]   only pay for the cost to repair at any facility
[00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:31.560]   at their rates.
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:33.460]   So in some states, I know California is one of them,
[00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:35.320]   you can choose where you repair your vehicle.
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:38.240]   The insurance company can't tell you where you have to go,
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:40.440]   but they don't have to pay the rates of every carrier,
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.920]   they have to pay fair rates.
[00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:45.160]   There are some carriers that will pay for the rates
[00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:47.600]   even at those high cost facilities.
[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:49.720]   There are some carriers that either have add-ons
[00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:53.840]   or by default always pay for original manufacturer OEM parts
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:55.600]   and they don't require you to consider
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:57.560]   paying for cheaper parts.
[00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:58.520]   I know in a lot of cases,
[00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:00.720]   if they will only pay for aftermarket parts,
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:03.320]   you can request them to pay for OEM parts
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:04.660]   or you can pay the difference.
[00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:07.620]   There are some carriers that will replace damaged car seats,
[00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:10.200]   but it's not standard in a lot of policies.
[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:11.920]   And so if you get in an accident
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:15.640]   and you had two $300 car seats, you're out that $600.
[00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:18.860]   And then there are some carriers like Chubb and Pure,
[00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:20.440]   which I'll talk about a little later,
[00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:24.000]   that are much more kind of high net worth premium carriers
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.680]   that just have really big coverages
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:27.440]   for things like uninsured motorists.
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:29.680]   I think Chubb goes up to $10 million.
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:30.960]   So if you were to get an accident
[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:33.760]   that prevented you from working in any capacity,
[00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:36.480]   the state disability policies that you might have
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:37.960]   or even a short-term disability policy
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:39.280]   is probably not gonna cover the fact
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:41.240]   that you can't work for the rest of your life.
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:44.120]   And if someone's policy that gets into an accident with you
[00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:46.600]   has no coverage and your uninsured motorist
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:48.760]   that you have only goes to 100,000,
[00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:50.120]   then that's the max you're gonna get.
[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:52.600]   But in Chubb's case, they have a $10 million policy there.
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:54.680]   So that's something that I think
[00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:57.600]   it comes at an extremely high cost, which I'll talk about.
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:59.720]   But I just wanna go over some of the things
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:01.160]   that differ between policies.
[00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:03.440]   I'm not gonna go into all the deals
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:05.360]   if you're trying to rent a car, how to save money.
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:08.120]   But if you go back and listen to episode 66
[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:10.380]   with Jonathan Weinberg from Auto Slash,
[00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:12.540]   we went through every single rental car hack
[00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:13.380]   you could imagine.
[00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:15.440]   So if you need to rent a car after getting an accident
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:17.480]   or anything like that, definitely listen to that
[00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:18.840]   and see if you can save some money,
[00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:20.720]   unless your insurance company is gonna cover it all,
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.920]   in which case it's not a priority to save them money.
[00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:24.520]   One other thing I will mention though,
[00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:26.080]   is if you're listening to this and you don't have a car,
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:29.760]   it is worth considering getting a non-owner liability policy
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:33.120]   if you do drive regularly or rent cars regularly.
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:37.100]   That one allows you to decline the rental car coverage,
[00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:38.120]   which can be expensive,
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:40.720]   because if you don't have your own auto policy,
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:42.800]   you definitely wanna make sure that when you're driving
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:44.920]   a rental car, you have liability coverage,
[00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:48.160]   and you have liability coverage that matches your net worth.
[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.300]   Because some of those default policies
[00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:53.240]   that are included for liability at a rental car agency
[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:55.240]   might be $25,000.
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:58.080]   And that's fine if you have a $10,000 net worth,
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:20:59.340]   but it's definitely not fine
[00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:00.600]   if you have a million dollar net worth.
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:02.400]   So if you don't have a car,
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:04.000]   so you don't have auto insurance,
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.320]   but you do drive somewhat regularly
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:08.040]   or rent cars from time to time,
[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:10.560]   definitely look into non-owner policies
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:11.800]   for liability coverage.
[00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:12.920]   So if you're wondering what I decided,
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:14.560]   I will get to where we ended up
[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:16.360]   after I run through all four policies,
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:18.520]   because there's some bundling perspective
[00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:19.360]   that I wanna add.
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:22.120]   So that's auto, now let's talk about your home.
[00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:25.420]   One of the ways I like to keep my mind sharp
[00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:27.820]   is to constantly be learning new things.
[00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:30.740]   And one of my favorite ways to do that is with masterclass,
[00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:33.340]   who I'm excited to partner with for this episode.
[00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:36.460]   With masterclass, you can learn from the world's best minds
[00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:39.400]   anytime, anywhere, and at your own pace.
[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:41.000]   You can learn to buy and sell real estate
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.220]   from Robert Refkin,
[00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:44.860]   or improve your cooking skills with Gordon Ramsay,
[00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:47.600]   or even learn gardening from Ron Finley.
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:49.560]   With over 2,500 classes
[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:52.320]   from a range of world-class instructors,
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:54.000]   that thing you've always wanted to do
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.700]   is closer than you think.
[00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:57.480]   Seriously, I feel like every time
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:58.580]   I wanna learn something new,
[00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:00.340]   I can find a class on the topic
[00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:02.300]   from one of the best in the world.
[00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:04.900]   For example, if you're interested in starting a company,
[00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:07.200]   Alexis Ohanian, who co-founded Reddit
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.940]   and has invested in multiple billion-dollar companies,
[00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:12.920]   has an amazing new class that will teach you everything,
[00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:15.060]   from finding the problem you wanna solve,
[00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:17.860]   to raising money, to all the operational stuff
[00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:19.900]   like hiring and executing.
[00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:21.160]   I've spent time with Alexis,
[00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:23.240]   and he is world-class at this stuff,
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:25.520]   so I highly recommend you check it out.
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:28.160]   Get unlimited access to every class,
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:29.840]   and as an All The Hacks listener,

[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:45.920]   I wanna tell you all about the most amazing way
[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:47.320]   to buy a second home,
[00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:49.320]   and I know because we actually bought one
[00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:51.180]   for 1/8th the cost.
[00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:53.300]   And don't worry, I'm not talking timeshares.
[00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:54.940]   I'm talking about Picasso,
[00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:57.460]   and I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:58.420]   So how does it work?
[00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:00.800]   Picasso buys amazing luxury homes
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:03.300]   in over 40 world-class destinations,
[00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:05.300]   creates an LLC for each home,
[00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:08.340]   and you can buy as little as 1/8th of the property.
[00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:09.660]   But it doesn't stop there.
[00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:12.540]   Picasso also professionally manages the home,
[00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:17.540]   handling design, cleaning, bills, repairs, taxes, and more.
[00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:20.480]   And the scheduling system makes it fair and equitable
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.760]   for everyone to enjoy their home.
[00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:26.440]   When we found Picasso, it felt like it was made just for us.
[00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:29.560]   That same week, we found the perfect place in Napa,
[00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:32.480]   we toured it, and the next week, we were closing.
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:34.920]   Since then, it's truly become our second home,
[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:36.560]   and it's been so amazing.
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:38.840]   And it's true real estate ownership.
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:42.240]   Owners can sell at any time, set their own price,
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:45.520]   and tap into Picasso's active marketplace of buyers.
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:49.700]   In fact, on average, Picasso listings resale in 12 days
[00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:52.060]   with a 12% annualized gain.
[00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:55.300]   For a modern way to buy and own a second home,
[00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:58.380]   go to allthehacks.com/picasso,
[00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:01.940]   where our listeners will get a free Picasso access account,
[00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:03.580]   which means you can see new listings
[00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:05.380]   before they go on the website
[00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:09.460]   and get up to $10,000 in credit towards closing costs.
[00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:13.380]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/picasso,
[00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:16.440]   P-A-C-A-S-S-O.
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:18.520]   So generally, homeowner's insurance covers
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:20.560]   the destruction and damage to your home,
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:22.800]   the loss or the theft of possessions,
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:25.240]   personal liability if something were to happen
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:26.800]   to someone on your property,
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:29.040]   or if you need to be out of your home,
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:31.080]   your ability to stay somewhere else
[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:33.680]   while your home's unable to be lived in.
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:34.760]   I don't think there's really a question
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:36.920]   of whether or not you should have homeowner's insurance
[00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:38.380]   or renter's insurance, you should.
[00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:39.840]   Most mortgage lenders require it,
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:41.440]   so it's not even an option.
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:43.920]   But I will remind people that depending on where you live,
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:46.520]   natural disasters like floods, hurricanes, earthquakes
[00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:48.400]   are often excluded from a policy
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:50.000]   and you might need a separate policy.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.320]   Renter's insurance is very similar
[00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:52.540]   to homeowner's insurance.
[00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:55.720]   It protects your property, offers liability coverage,
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:57.160]   damage to the goods you have,
[00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:59.420]   covers the cost of another place
[00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:01.120]   if you can't live in your current place.
[00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:02.480]   But damage to the building
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:04.520]   is actually still the responsibility of the landlord
[00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:06.440]   and covered by their insurance policy.
[00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:08.640]   So renter's insurance is less expensive
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.880]   because the big bulk of that policy
[00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:12.920]   is actually gonna be held by your landlord.
[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:16.160]   So the main coverages you'll have in a policy like this,
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:18.880]   and very nicely, they have letter labels,
[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:20.040]   so it's A through E,
[00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:21.620]   as I'm pulling up one of the quotes I have.
[00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:24.200]   So coverage A is your kind of main dwelling
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:25.240]   and attached structures.
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:28.140]   That covers your house, if your garage is attached,
[00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:30.820]   if you have decks, that's the main coverage thing.
[00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:33.920]   That's the number that it's gonna cost to replace your home.
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:35.840]   And that's only on homeowners.
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:38.120]   Then there's a coverage B, which is other structures.
[00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:39.840]   So that's if you have a detached garage
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:42.200]   or a shed or any other buildings on your property.
[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:43.360]   Those two, A and B,
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:45.560]   are ones that are the responsibility of the homeowner.
[00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:46.760]   The rest of these coverages,
[00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:49.200]   while they might not have this letter on a renter's policy,
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:51.320]   you have them on renter's policies as well.
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:53.400]   Coverage C is for your personal property.
[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:56.340]   That's your furniture, your clothing, anything in the house.
[00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:58.080]   Coverage D is loss of use.
[00:25:58.080 --> 00:25:59.440]   That's if you can't be in your home
[00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:02.260]   and you need to rent a home or stay at a hotel.
[00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:03.680]   Coverage E is liability.
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:06.000]   That's if something were to happen to someone on the property
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.800]   and that covers your liability.
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:10.440]   And then coverage F, like auto, is medical payments.
[00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:14.360]   That covers the cost of the co-pays or the deductibles
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:15.960]   or any medical issues.
[00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:16.920]   And there's two interesting things.
[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:19.200]   One, your deductible doesn't usually apply here
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:20.680]   for medical payment coverage.
[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:23.320]   But also, if you're able to help someone
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:24.880]   who got injured on your property
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:27.600]   pay for all of their deductibles or their co-pays,
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:29.240]   you might actually prevent them
[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:31.880]   from suing you for any monetary compensation.
[00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:33.660]   And so that medical payments coverage
[00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:37.040]   might prevent you from needing to take a liability claim,
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:38.400]   which even if your insurance policy
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:40.100]   will cover that liability claim,
[00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:42.320]   it's certainly gonna be better in the long run
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:44.360]   for your rates to not have to tap
[00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:45.680]   into that liability coverage
[00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:47.400]   and just focus on that medical payments coverage,
[00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:49.640]   especially because the deductible also won't apply.
[00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:50.560]   When I was thinking about this,
[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:52.920]   the most important thing is to have enough coverage.
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:55.240]   One thing that we realized in San Francisco
[00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:58.660]   a handful of years ago is that our home appreciated
[00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:00.620]   a lot faster than we had realized,
[00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:03.040]   which was a great thing to have happen.
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:05.000]   But when that happened, the rebuilding costs
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.520]   to build that home went up
[00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:08.740]   and our policy wasn't actually covered enough.
[00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:11.640]   So I definitely think you wanna keep an eye
[00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:13.320]   on the value of your home,
[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:15.880]   the cost to replace it, rebuilding costs,
[00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:18.440]   and make sure you adjust your policies as needed.
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:19.640]   A lot of policies have something
[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:21.480]   called extended reconstruction,
[00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:22.800]   which basically says, oh,
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:24.680]   if at the time that something happens,
[00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:26.800]   costs have gone up, it will cover the difference.
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:28.760]   So that's definitely something that I would add
[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:31.520]   because you never know what the circumstances will be like.
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:34.360]   During COVID, lumber prices were super expensive.
[00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:36.800]   So you probably would have needed more coverage
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:38.280]   than you did the year before.
[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:41.000]   And so similarly, as we kind of grew up in life
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   and we upgraded from Ikea furniture
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.440]   to more expensive furniture,
[00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:45.900]   you'd wanna make sure you have enough coverage
[00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:47.520]   on your personal property as well.
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:50.600]   So I just like to take a quick evaluation every year
[00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:52.180]   of home values, what's gone up,
[00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:55.240]   maybe ask a real estate agent what empty lots
[00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:56.920]   or teardowns are going for.
[00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:58.240]   And if you could say, okay, well,
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:27:59.860]   I live on a lot this size.
[00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:01.920]   If I could buy a teardown for this much
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:03.320]   and I could sell my home for this much,
[00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:05.600]   that delta is probably what it's gonna cost
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:06.720]   to build something nice.
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:08.320]   You could also just ask around.
[00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:10.160]   People often know the cost to build
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:12.080]   on a per square foot basis.
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:15.600]   Or a lot of the insurance carriers have these estimators.
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:18.480]   I found that every time I talked to a carrier,
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:21.440]   their estimator came in about 20% lower
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:22.920]   than when I talked to someone who knew
[00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:25.040]   about the cost to build in the area.
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:30.040]   The good news is that as long as you let the carrier decide
[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:32.320]   what they think you need to be covered by.
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:34.400]   So for example, if your carrier says you need
[00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:37.640]   to have $700,000 of coverage on the house,
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:40.200]   and you think, well, it might be more like 800,
[00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:42.600]   as long as they're signed off on the 700
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:45.240]   and that's the cost, the extended reconstruction
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:48.000]   might kick in if they're wrong.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.600]   That said, personally, I just wanna make sure
[00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:52.640]   that I am as close to covered as possible
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:55.320]   and that that extended reconstruction only kicks in
[00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:58.480]   if there's actually incremental costs that were unplanned.
[00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:00.520]   So I tried to get as much coverage
[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:04.320]   and not try to save here by using their low estimates,
[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:05.880]   but I would definitely make sure you have
[00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:07.600]   that extended reconstruction coverage
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:08.800]   if the carrier allows it,
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:10.560]   or maybe look for a carrier that does.
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:13.160]   And some of the high value carriers like Chubb and Pure,
[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:15.040]   which I'll get to, might even have something
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:15.960]   that goes beyond that.
[00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:17.800]   So this extended reconstruction thing's interesting
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:21.080]   because you can add 20%, you can add 50%,
[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:23.000]   some carriers let you add 100%,
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.400]   meaning if that coverage A amount for your home is $700,000,
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:30.800]   they'll cover you up to 1.4 million to rebuild the home,
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:32.200]   but there are some carriers
[00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:34.680]   that offer guaranteed replacement value.
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:36.920]   So it's like, it goes beyond whatever percent is,
[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:39.000]   it's just, we're gonna pay to do that.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.280]   And then even more than that, some carriers,
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:43.160]   and it's really only the high value ones,
[00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:45.160]   so unfortunately, it's not something that I think
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:47.040]   I'm gonna take advantage of right now,
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:49.720]   but they'll give you an option to just take a cash payout,
[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:52.880]   whereas most carriers will just reimburse you along the way
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:54.360]   for rebuilding the home.
[00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:56.120]   So if you don't wanna go through the process
[00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:59.200]   of rebuilding your home, some of those high value carriers
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:01.120]   like Pure and Chubb and Cincinnati
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:04.320]   will offer you just this one time, here's the cash payout,
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:06.200]   you can take this and sell your lot
[00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:07.560]   and not worry about rebuilding.
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:09.480]   So when I'm thinking about these coverages,
[00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:12.640]   I wouldn't think about dialing back any of the coverages
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:15.320]   to save money unless you really don't need them.
[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:18.200]   So a few of the ones that I think you can consider
[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:20.000]   playing around with, but I will point out
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.640]   that many carriers just have a fixed number.
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:25.720]   So your loss of use might be 10 or 20%
[00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:26.840]   of your dwelling coverage.
[00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:29.840]   Your other structures might be 10 or 20%.
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:32.240]   So you don't really get to play with a lot of the dials.
[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:33.720]   Some carriers, though, will let you.
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:35.480]   So Lemonade, for example, lets you play
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:37.760]   with your loss of use and your property coverage.
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:40.720]   Some carriers say, "Do you want 10 or 20%?"
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:43.520]   When it comes to a few things, on personal property,
[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:45.880]   you probably have some sense walking around your house
[00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:48.400]   that whether you have a bunch of really expensive things
[00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:50.560]   or not, whether your kitchen is done
[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:52.760]   with really expensive appliances or not,
[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:55.720]   so you might not need as much personal property coverage
[00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:56.680]   as is default.
[00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:59.040]   So you could dial that back if you don't think you need it.
[00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:01.880]   On loss of use, if you happen to have two homes
[00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:03.720]   or you have family that lives nearby,
[00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:06.000]   plenty of space for you, you might consider
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.520]   not having as much loss of use coverage.
[00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:11.080]   But if you don't, you might wanna consider having extra
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:14.480]   just so that you aren't forced to go live too far away.
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:17.280]   Some carriers even guarantee that they'll find you
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:19.640]   a place comparable in your school district,
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:21.280]   while others might just give you a budget
[00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:22.920]   and you have one year to spend it,
[00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:24.680]   which if you know anyone who's built a home,
[00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:27.000]   one year might not even be enough.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.120]   Some of the other extras, earthquake is one.
[00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:31.600]   I think it's a really personal decision
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:34.240]   because it's very expensive in the Bay Area.
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:36.680]   Your earthquake coverage might actually cost as much
[00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:38.880]   or potentially more than your homeowner's coverage.
[00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:42.360]   Then there's coverage for things like floods are the same
[00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:44.080]   or hurricanes, so look into those.
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:46.320]   Maybe ask some friends how they've thought about it
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:48.280]   who live in the area you live in.
[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:51.080]   A lot of other small coverages that you need to consider,
[00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:54.600]   whether you need jewelry coverage, both on the policy,
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:57.320]   sometimes you can increase the amount that will be covered.
[00:31:57.320 --> 00:32:00.160]   Sometimes it might say we only cover jewelry up to $500,
[00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:03.200]   but you can add something on that will cover any items
[00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:05.320]   up to 1,000 or 2,000 or 5,000.
[00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:08.080]   If you have something that costs 10,000, 50,000,
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:09.600]   you probably wanna get a separate policy
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:10.440]   and I'll talk about that.
[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:13.840]   There's water backup coverage in case your sump pump fails
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:16.480]   or there's water coming through the sewers into your home,
[00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:18.400]   identity theft, worker's comp,
[00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:20.720]   if you have someone living or working in your home,
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:22.720]   like an au pair, those are all things.
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:24.320]   There are some carriers that offer
[00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:27.040]   what's called a large loss deductible waiver,
[00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:30.160]   which basically means if there is a large loss,
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:31.000]   they usually have a limit.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   If there was a loss over $500,000 or over $100,000,
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.120]   they'll waive your deductible.
[00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:37.240]   That's something interesting.
[00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:38.400]   And then that thing I mentioned earlier,
[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:39.840]   guaranteed replacement cost.
[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:41.080]   If it's offered, would be great.
[00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:42.880]   They're just gonna guarantee they'll replace your home.
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:45.120]   You don't have to worry about changing the amounts
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:47.600]   or having enough extended reconstruction.
[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:50.680]   So when it comes to picking these coverages,
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:51.760]   gonna be a unique question,
[00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:53.920]   but when it comes to ways to save,
[00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:55.000]   I think there are a few things.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.440]   So one, similar to what I was talking about with auto
[00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:00.160]   is think about your deductibles.
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:03.160]   For us, I think on the homeowner's policy,
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:06.320]   we really want this for like major catastrophic issues.
[00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:08.600]   So we're comfortable with a higher deductible,
[00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:11.280]   knowing that if something small were to happen,
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:12.920]   we're just gonna have to pay out of pocket.
[00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:15.480]   And that's what our emergency fund is for.
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:17.520]   I don't know what the impact of having a homeowner's claim
[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:18.800]   is when it comes to rates,
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:20.560]   but I know that as we were shopping around
[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:24.320]   for homeowners right now, every single carrier asked,
[00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:25.920]   have you had a claim in the last three years?
[00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:27.160]   Have you had a claim in the last three years?
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:29.560]   So I can't imagine that it doesn't have an impact.
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:31.800]   Also, there are a lot of discounts for homeowners
[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:33.560]   that you wanna look into.
[00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:35.920]   Obvious ones that they always ask are about alarms,
[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:38.640]   but especially alarms that report to local fire
[00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:41.000]   and police stations or central monitoring,
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.560]   fire sprinklers, security cameras,
[00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:47.280]   all those things can reduce your policy by 15, 20%.
[00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:48.680]   But there are also a few extra things to consider.
[00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:50.600]   So we have Ring for our alarm system,
[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:53.000]   and they make these smoke alarm listeners.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.560]   We have Nest Protects around the house for our smoke alarms.
[00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:57.080]   And if you put one of these listeners
[00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:59.280]   next to your Nest Protect,
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:00.600]   what you can actually do
[00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:02.440]   is turn your Ring monitoring system,
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:04.160]   that's normally just a burglary alarm
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:05.360]   in case someone breaks in,
[00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:07.000]   but it'll listen for the smoke alarm
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.840]   and report that as well.
[00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:10.360]   And so now you all of a sudden
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:13.160]   have a fire and smoke central reporting alarm,
[00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:15.840]   which qualifies you often for more discounts.
[00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:19.440]   They also make a flood and freeze sensor
[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:22.160]   that you can put in that might qualify you for discounts.
[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:24.480]   There are also a handful of organizations
[00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:25.640]   that offer discounts.
[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:27.560]   So when we were looking at travelers,
[00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:29.920]   I started searching for travelers discount,
[00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:32.480]   and I found that members of PenFed,
[00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:35.160]   which is a credit union, get a discount on travelers.
[00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:36.800]   It's like an affinity discount.
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:38.680]   And so I just joined PenFed
[00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:40.840]   so that I'd be eligible for the travelers discount.
[00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:42.200]   We didn't end up going with travelers,
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:43.840]   but it was free to join PenFed,
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:46.040]   and I wanted to see what the discounted rate would be.
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:48.360]   There are also some carriers like USAA
[00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:50.880]   that are only available to specific people.
[00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:52.680]   I wouldn't say you necessarily save money,
[00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:54.240]   though in our case for home,
[00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:55.960]   USAA was definitely the best rate.
[00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:58.160]   For auto, it was a little bit higher,
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:01.240]   but by having a father who was in the military,
[00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:03.480]   I was eligible and you're required
[00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:05.200]   to have some relationship to the military
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:06.600]   like that to be eligible.
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:08.040]   But now that I'm eligible,
[00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:09.520]   so will my children, et cetera.
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:12.200]   So if anyone in your family is in the military
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:14.320]   or maybe was a grandparent that's still alive,
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:16.600]   if they join, then your parent can join
[00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:17.640]   and then you can join.
[00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:19.960]   So definitely something worth looking into
[00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:21.480]   if that's a situation you're in.
[00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:22.680]   And then the other big way to save
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:25.640]   is to just comparison shop like I've talked about before.
[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:29.120]   Unfortunately, there's no great perfect comparison site.
[00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:31.520]   I've looked at a lot of the sites that say,
[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:33.720]   "Oh, we'll shop across all the carriers."
[00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:36.280]   They usually only shop across some of the carriers.
[00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:38.760]   So I had to go through and kind of do it manually
[00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:39.920]   and it was a lot of work.
[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:41.960]   And I actually am wondering whether this would have been
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:44.480]   a great virtual assistant task in hindsight,
[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:46.760]   but knowing I was gonna do this episode,
[00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:48.880]   I think it was something I wanted to do myself.
[00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:50.440]   But one hack that might save you a little time
[00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:52.120]   when you're doing some comparison shopping,
[00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:54.040]   they have all these quizzes about your home,
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:55.600]   the size, the roof material.
[00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:57.160]   Some of them get very complicated.
[00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:59.840]   I think the one on USAA is like hundreds of questions
[00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:01.840]   like what square footage is each bathroom?
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:03.760]   Does it have a tub or does it have a shower?
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:05.000]   Do you have a chandelier?
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.440]   And then some of them just ask five or six questions.
[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:10.080]   But usually at the end of that process,
[00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:12.680]   you can just choose the coverage amount
[00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:15.040]   as long as it's above what they estimated.
[00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:18.600]   So if you want a comparison price, some insurance policies,
[00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:20.440]   you could just run through that quiz
[00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:23.080]   knowing you're gonna get some of the answers wrong,
[00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:25.800]   get to the end, change the coverage to what you want
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:27.280]   so you can compare policies.
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:29.560]   And then once you find the right one,
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:31.760]   I would definitely make sure that when you actually go
[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:33.920]   to get that policy, you redo it,
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:35.560]   answering the questions perfectly.
[00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:37.000]   But when you're just price shopping
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:37.920]   and trying to get a quote,
[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:39.880]   you might not need to answer all those questions
[00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:42.120]   because you can change the coverage amount at the end.
[00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:44.280]   And then another big one, I'm gonna talk about bundling,
[00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:46.640]   but it's definitely something to consider.
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:48.640]   But I wouldn't always assume it was the best.
[00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:52.080]   For a while, we were with Lemonade and it was cheaper
[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:54.920]   even though we didn't bundle with auto for us.
[00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:56.520]   But now looking at policies,
[00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:59.160]   I think bundling actually is gonna be a better deal.
[00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:00.040]   And then one last thing
[00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:01.920]   that isn't really gonna save you money now,
[00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:03.680]   but it definitely will in the future.
[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:07.680]   And it came up in episode 35 with Joe Salsihai
[00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:10.200]   is to make sure you document everything you have
[00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:13.440]   in your home for any potential property claims.
[00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:16.800]   So I would walk through with your video on your phone
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:19.840]   into every room and just make sure that you point out,
[00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:22.680]   here's our TV, here's our stereo, here's our couch,
[00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:24.480]   here's the person who makes it.
[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:26.400]   Obviously some of these things like furniture
[00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:29.360]   or major purchases, you probably have the receipts for,
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:32.520]   but I think it would be very, very important to go around
[00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:34.080]   and make sure you've documented everything,
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:35.440]   at least in a video.
[00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:37.280]   Go in your closet, here's our clothes,
[00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:39.120]   go in your room and everything.
[00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:40.560]   That's something that I would do.
[00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:42.560]   Garage, tools, all of that.
[00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:45.560]   And I would even consider for really expensive things
[00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:47.280]   like a TV or a computer,
[00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:50.080]   just write down the model and the serial number somewhere
[00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:52.000]   just so you can kind of prove what it is
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.520]   and make sure you get properly reimbursed
[00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:55.560]   if something were to happen.
[00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:57.840]   Now, I mentioned earlier that some of the high value things
[00:37:57.840 --> 00:37:59.120]   like jewelry aren't covered.
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:01.400]   And so if you have any expensive jewelry,
[00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:03.680]   art, bikes, cameras,
[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:07.000]   you probably need an additional rider on your insurance,
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.320]   often called a personal articles policy.
[00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:10.480]   It varies by carrier.
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:13.080]   Oftentimes the threshold is about $1,000
[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:14.720]   and the policies aren't that expensive,
[00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:17.920]   maybe about 1% of the value of the item.
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:19.200]   It's definitely something that
[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:21.160]   if you have an expensive engagement ring
[00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:22.720]   or a really nice bike,
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:25.040]   I would look at covering separately.
[00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:27.720]   The policy that we have for Amy's ring
[00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:29.520]   is less than $100 a year.
[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:30.960]   And I think it has no deductible.
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:33.200]   So definitely something worth looking into
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:35.120]   if you have any of those items.
[00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:36.760]   Previously, we talked about liability
[00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:38.600]   and umbrella very briefly.
[00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:40.320]   But while your home policy
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:41.920]   will cover the liability in your home
[00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:44.600]   and your auto policy will cover the liability in your car,
[00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:45.880]   it might not be enough.
[00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:48.920]   For example, if you have $250,000 of liability,
[00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:50.560]   that doesn't mean that someone couldn't sue you
[00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:53.000]   for a million or 2 million or 5 million.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.480]   Now, if you don't have $2 million,
[00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:57.800]   it's unlikely that they're gonna try to expect
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:58.920]   to get 2 million from you.
[00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:01.080]   So they're probably not gonna bring a suit like that
[00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:02.240]   against you.
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:03.640]   But if you were in an accident
[00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:06.720]   and you caused serious injury or even death to someone,
[00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:09.680]   I could see a suit coming for more than 250,000,
[00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:11.520]   especially if you have more than that.
[00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:14.160]   And so that's where umbrella or excess liability
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:16.320]   or personal liability insurance comes in.
[00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:19.160]   And it sits on top of your home and auto policies
[00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:20.480]   and it covers the liability
[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:23.120]   for as much as you wanna pay for, depending on the carrier.
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:24.640]   They aren't that expensive.
[00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:26.520]   They're usually a few hundred dollars
[00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:29.000]   for your first $1 million of coverage
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.680]   and then maybe another 100 or 200
[00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:32.200]   for every 1 million after that.
[00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:33.760]   Definitely check to see.
[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:37.280]   They do require usually that one of your home
[00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:39.920]   or auto policies are with that carrier.
[00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:41.680]   It's not always the case,
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:44.600]   but I know GEICO won't write a umbrella policy
[00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:46.240]   unless you have auto with them.
[00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:48.560]   I know USAA won't write a umbrella policy
[00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:51.320]   unless you have auto and home with them.
[00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:54.160]   So definitely worth talking to someone about that.
[00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:56.200]   When it comes to how much to have,
[00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:57.280]   I think there's a lot of people
[00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:58.760]   that will give you different answers.
[00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:01.800]   I know some people that cover their net worth in full.
[00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:04.360]   I know some people that are comfortable with just a million.
[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:06.440]   I know some people with a huge net worth
[00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:09.520]   that only think five or 10 million is necessary.
[00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:12.080]   And so I don't know a lot of people
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:14.960]   that have more than $10 million of umbrella coverage
[00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:16.840]   no matter how much money they have,
[00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:20.840]   but because some states allow you to go after someone
[00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:23.600]   not just for the money they have and the assets they have,
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:25.080]   but also their future earnings,
[00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:27.040]   it's definitely something that I think
[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:30.720]   many people might not have, but probably should.
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:33.080]   Obviously when you're young and early in your career
[00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:35.480]   and you don't have a huge net worth, it's not as important,
[00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:37.400]   but as you start to save and have assets
[00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:39.600]   and have significant earnings potential,
[00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:41.240]   definitely worth considering.
[00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:43.840]   So that's the four main policies
[00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:45.800]   that I've been focused on recently.
[00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:48.560]   Let me talk a little bit about how I decided
[00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:51.280]   and evaluated carriers and figured out what to do.
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:55.960]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:59.480]   I get it, life comes at you fast, but trust me,
[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:02.360]   your friends are probably desperate for a good hang.
[00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:06.440]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:08.400]   Just make sure you do it the easy way
[00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:10.320]   and let our sponsor Drizzly,
[00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:14.040]   the go-to app for drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:16.880]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:18.720]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:20.120]   It could be your dog's birthday,
[00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:22.120]   that the sun finally came out,
[00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:23.600]   or maybe you just wanna celebrate
[00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:25.680]   that you got through another week.
[00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:27.760]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy
[00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:30.320]   by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:32.080]   which means you can entice your friends
[00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:35.160]   to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:36.840]   And since I know you like a good deal,
[00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:39.400]   Drizzly compares prices on their massive selection
[00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:42.380]   of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:44.420]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails
[00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:46.240]   while we were hosting family last week,
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:48.320]   not only could I get an Italian Amaro
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:49.960]   delivered in less than an hour,
[00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:53.440]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:55.080]   So whatever the occasion,
[00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:58.360]   download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:02.360]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:05.620]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:09.460]   Did you know that someone new gets impacted
[00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:12.200]   by identity theft every two seconds?
[00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:14.020]   It makes sense when there's so much
[00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:16.640]   of our personal information getting shared online
[00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:18.160]   without our consent.
[00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:20.480]   I found a listing for my dad on a site
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:24.320]   called Family Tree Now that had his name, age, address,
[00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:27.200]   phone number, email, past addresses,
[00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:28.920]   and the names of his relatives.
[00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:33.480]   And that was just one of the 69 listings that had his info.
[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:35.600]   Fortunately, instead of spending hours
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:37.440]   finding all the sites with his info
[00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:39.600]   and submitting the request to take it down,
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:42.840]   I got it all done in minutes with Delete.me from Abine,
[00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:45.160]   and I am so excited to be partnering with them
[00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:46.120]   for this episode.
[00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:47.880]   Delete.me is an amazing service
[00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:51.160]   that will not just find and remove your personal information
[00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:53.960]   from over 500 data broker websites,
[00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:57.080]   but they'll continuously scan for new data that shows up
[00:42:57.080 --> 00:42:58.720]   and get that removed as well.
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:00.640]   On average, Delete.me finds and removes
[00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:03.020]   over 2,000 pieces of data for a customer
[00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:04.360]   in their first two years,
[00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:08.400]   and to date, they've removed over 35 million pieces of data
[00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:09.360]   for their customers.
[00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:11.400]   So if you wanna get your personal information
[00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:13.920]   removed from all these listings on the internet,
[00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:16.960]   go to allthehacks.com/deleteme
[00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:21.440]   and get 20% off a plan for you or your entire family.
[00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:25.400]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/deleteme.
[00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:28.480]   I just wanna thank you quick for listening to
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:29.960]   and supporting the show.
[00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:32.800]   Your support is what keeps this show going.
[00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:36.320]   To get all of the URLs, codes, deals, and discounts
[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:40.800]   from our partners, you can go to allthehacks.com/deals.
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:44.160]   So please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:46.920]   I'm sure people will come back and say they disagree
[00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:50.520]   or they had better experiences with some of these or worse,
[00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:52.440]   but in general, when I talked to people
[00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:54.560]   and I read through lots of comments on forums
[00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:55.960]   and Reddit and everything,
[00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:57.200]   it seemed like all the carriers
[00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:58.880]   kind of fell into three buckets.
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:00.320]   There were your standard carriers,
[00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:03.280]   your GEICO, your Progressive, your State Farm.
[00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:05.720]   There were carriers that were still kind of mainstream,
[00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:08.480]   but people categorized as better or more premium.
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:13.200]   Travelers came up here, Safeco, Amica, USAA,
[00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:16.240]   and then there were actually the premium insurers.
[00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:20.040]   So these are carriers not just that will write coverage
[00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:21.520]   beyond what traditional covers do,
[00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:24.200]   but just have a much more high-end experience.
[00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:26.480]   Two of the bigger ones are Pure and Chubb,
[00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:29.160]   but other ones are Cincinnati, AIG,
[00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:31.880]   Nationwide Private Client, Hartford, et cetera.
[00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:34.640]   One thing to note is that a lot of them have minimums.
[00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:37.160]   So even if you had a home only worth a million dollars,
[00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:39.800]   some of them might write the limits to 3 million.
[00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:41.800]   So it's never gonna be a reasonable price.
[00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:43.640]   When I looked at the premium insurers,
[00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:48.160]   it was gonna be almost 30, 40% more to use any of them.
[00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:50.960]   And while I talked earlier about some of the things
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:53.280]   you get from those expensive, nice policies
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:57.040]   like guaranteed replacement or better, faster claims,
[00:44:57.040 --> 00:44:59.200]   use any repair shop, OEM parts,
[00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:01.720]   paying 30, 40% more just wasn't worth it for me.
[00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:03.720]   Also to do some research for this episode,
[00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:05.960]   I went and paid for Consumer Reports
[00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:07.760]   and I wanted to look at their data.
[00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:08.980]   When you look at home and auto,
[00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:12.060]   the top three carriers on both are the same.
[00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:15.040]   It's USAA, Amica, and NJM.
[00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:17.600]   And NJM, which is New Jersey Manufacturers,
[00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:20.480]   they definitely stood out as the top three rated
[00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:22.480]   on all different aspects.
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:25.320]   But a few of the ones that were below those top three
[00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:28.620]   that stood out a little bit on both auto and home
[00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:31.600]   were Chubb, Cincinnati, Auto Owners,
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:33.520]   Erie, and Country Financial.
[00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:34.700]   I looked at Chubb and Cincinnati
[00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:35.920]   and they were too expensive.
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:37.240]   I looked at a few of the others.
[00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:39.940]   Erie, for example, doesn't operate in California,
[00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:42.240]   but that's just save you some time from Consumer Reports.
[00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:44.560]   That doesn't mean that other carriers aren't great.
[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:46.380]   I've heard lots of good things about Pure.
[00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:48.160]   I've actually heard lots of good things about Travelers,
[00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:50.240]   though Consumer Reports didn't think they were great.
[00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:52.040]   But I figured I'd just share, save you some time,
[00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:55.920]   or save you the $39 a year to get access to those ratings.
[00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:56.980]   That's a lot of the carriers,
[00:45:56.980 --> 00:45:58.740]   but how do you actually go about doing this?
[00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:01.480]   And I wish that I could tell you it was easier,
[00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:03.560]   but some of these carriers,
[00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:05.400]   a lot of this kind of standard Geico,
[00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:07.960]   progressive, State Farm, you have to go direct to them
[00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:09.680]   and they don't work with brokers.
[00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:12.220]   And then a lot of the other carriers like Travelers
[00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:14.100]   and Safeco and Pure and Chubb,
[00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:15.540]   they only work through brokers.
[00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:18.060]   So you can't go one place
[00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:20.260]   and get access to all of the policies.
[00:46:20.260 --> 00:46:22.220]   I did go to a couple brokers.
[00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:24.620]   And I will say that, especially in California,
[00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:26.140]   I think nationwide,
[00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:28.260]   but all the insurers have very specific rates.
[00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:29.360]   So you're gonna get the same rate
[00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:31.260]   no matter which broker you work with.
[00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:32.900]   And like travel agents,
[00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:34.660]   the commissions are kind of baked in.
[00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:36.020]   And so I wouldn't worry about,
[00:46:36.020 --> 00:46:37.500]   "Oh, I don't wanna pay a broker's fee."
[00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:39.580]   'Cause that's just kind of built into the price
[00:46:39.580 --> 00:46:41.720]   and it's not really gonna cost you directly.
[00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:42.800]   I went to a few.
[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:45.100]   If you need a recommendation, I'm happy to send one,
[00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:47.460]   but it might vary by state and where you live.
[00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:49.420]   And so I'd definitely reach out locally.
[00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:51.060]   So what I did was I went online
[00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:52.940]   and I tried to do the quotes where I could online
[00:46:52.940 --> 00:46:54.540]   'cause it was way faster.
[00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:57.380]   I focused on carriers that had good reviews
[00:46:57.380 --> 00:46:59.340]   and that were easy to get in front of.
[00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:02.580]   And then I found a broker who could reach out on my behalf
[00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:04.660]   and pull quotes for a few of the other companies.
[00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:07.660]   So the match was me doing it for most of the carriers
[00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:09.340]   and then working with one broker
[00:47:09.340 --> 00:47:11.420]   to look at something like Travelers, Safeco
[00:47:11.420 --> 00:47:13.460]   and some of the premium insurers.
[00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:15.460]   While I ultimately didn't even come close
[00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:18.060]   to doing something like Pure or Cincinnati or Chubb,
[00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:19.780]   I did wanna know what it costs
[00:47:19.780 --> 00:47:21.300]   both for the purpose of this episode,
[00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:22.780]   to understand the benefits.
[00:47:22.780 --> 00:47:25.580]   And a part of me doesn't know how to value that, right?
[00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:29.220]   How do I value the fact that I'll be able to send my car
[00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:31.500]   to any repair shop if there's an accident?
[00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:34.540]   I'm sure I could do some kind of statistical model of,
[00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:36.180]   "Okay, well, what's the likelihood it's gonna happen?
[00:47:36.180 --> 00:47:38.740]   And what's the cost of it? And is it worth it?"
[00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:39.940]   But when I looked at it
[00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:42.540]   and it was gonna be an extra four to $5,000 a year
[00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:46.900]   for all our policies and require usually higher deductibles,
[00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:50.340]   I kind of took all of the super premium carriers off.
[00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:52.700]   And I'll keep in mind, I might mention carriers
[00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:55.060]   that I found to be expensive or not.
[00:47:55.060 --> 00:47:58.140]   And then I found plenty of people in forums
[00:47:58.140 --> 00:48:01.220]   or on Reddit that said, "That's so crazy.
[00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:03.020]   I compared USA to State Farm
[00:48:03.020 --> 00:48:04.740]   and State Farm was so much cheaper."
[00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:06.180]   And then the other person's like, "That's crazy.
[00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:08.340]   For me, USAA is so much cheaper."
[00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:12.740]   It really varies so much state by state, person by person,
[00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:15.540]   zip code by zip code, type of car, et cetera.
[00:48:15.540 --> 00:48:18.020]   So I wouldn't read too far into me saying
[00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:19.780]   that I had a better price at one.
[00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:21.300]   I would definitely do your homework.
[00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:23.300]   There are some sites like Policy Genius
[00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:25.220]   that are brokers online that can save you the time
[00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:27.420]   of having to get on the phone and do a lot of this.
[00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:29.540]   I did try to do that, but for some reason,
[00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:31.660]   the page where you hit submit never loaded.
[00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:33.260]   So it didn't work so well for me.
[00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:36.900]   But I will say that at least in California,
[00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:40.980]   the value of bundling made this a much harder decision
[00:48:40.980 --> 00:48:43.700]   because I would look at the prices and say,
[00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:46.740]   "Wow, State Farm, for example, was really great,
[00:48:46.740 --> 00:48:49.500]   but their umbrella policy was twice as expensive.
[00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:51.220]   And USAA was really competitive,
[00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:53.260]   but their auto was twice as expensive."
[00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:54.820]   So I kept going through this and being like,
[00:48:54.820 --> 00:48:57.220]   "I just want a cherry pick from each of them,"
[00:48:57.220 --> 00:49:02.060]   except the cost of the homeowner's policy would go up 20%
[00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:03.940]   if you didn't bundle it with auto.
[00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:07.100]   So it was very frustrating experience for me
[00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:09.540]   looking at all of these policies and saying,
[00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:10.940]   "I have to go with this company.
[00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:13.380]   I have to pay more for the auto policy
[00:49:13.380 --> 00:49:16.860]   because the savings for bundling makes up for it."
[00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:18.100]   I wish that wasn't the case.
[00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:19.620]   I wish I could pick and choose,
[00:49:19.620 --> 00:49:21.340]   but that's just the way it is.
[00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:24.860]   I actually looked at the total cost for each carrier
[00:49:24.860 --> 00:49:26.940]   instead of just policy by policy
[00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:30.940]   because that bundled savings ended up being so high on home.
[00:49:30.940 --> 00:49:33.020]   In California, best I can understand,
[00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:35.140]   there is no bundled savings for auto.
[00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:37.420]   So if you find a really great home price
[00:49:37.420 --> 00:49:38.660]   that doesn't require bundling,
[00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:40.380]   you get a little bit more flexibility,
[00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:43.700]   but it can make it hard for certain insurance carriers
[00:49:43.700 --> 00:49:45.340]   that don't offer everything.
[00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:47.340]   So for example, someone emailed in and asking
[00:49:47.340 --> 00:49:50.540]   why I didn't look at Tesla insurance for my Model 3.
[00:49:50.540 --> 00:49:54.340]   And the reality was it was a little bit less expensive.
[00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:56.820]   I was reasonably confident, though not 100%,
[00:49:56.820 --> 00:49:58.440]   that if I have Tesla insurance,
[00:49:58.440 --> 00:49:59.940]   they're at least not gonna make me go
[00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:01.580]   to some random repair shop
[00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:04.380]   and that they'll actually repair it at a Tesla dealership.
[00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:06.860]   But if I get Tesla insurance,
[00:50:06.860 --> 00:50:08.820]   I can't get any bundling discount
[00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:11.060]   and it's gonna raise the price of that homeowner's policy
[00:50:11.060 --> 00:50:13.360]   by $500 to $1,000 a year,
[00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:15.420]   which actually makes any discount
[00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:17.540]   from Tesla insurance not worth it.
[00:50:17.540 --> 00:50:19.860]   Ultimately, I looked at all the prices.
[00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:23.080]   I'm so close to the finish line, but not quite there.
[00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:27.380]   I'm waiting to hear back from one question on travelers.
[00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:28.900]   When you live in California,
[00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:31.180]   especially with being in proximity
[00:50:31.180 --> 00:50:33.520]   to places with wildfires and that kind of stuff,
[00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:35.500]   we're fortunately not in those zones,
[00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:37.300]   but it does require a lot of our quotes
[00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:38.900]   sometimes to go through underwriting
[00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:40.420]   to make sure it's all approved.
[00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:44.220]   So the process can be a 24, 48-hour turnaround.
[00:50:44.220 --> 00:50:48.220]   Ultimately, I think we'll end up at USAA or Travelers.
[00:50:48.220 --> 00:50:49.340]   That's my instinct.
[00:50:49.340 --> 00:50:53.340]   But it's gonna be close because GEICO right now
[00:50:53.340 --> 00:50:56.380]   is about $1,000 a year cheaper on auto,
[00:50:56.380 --> 00:50:58.440]   maybe because we've been there for a while,
[00:50:58.440 --> 00:50:59.980]   maybe because they're more generous
[00:50:59.980 --> 00:51:02.220]   with an international young driver.
[00:51:02.220 --> 00:51:05.580]   So I think it'll either be USAA or Travelers for home,
[00:51:05.580 --> 00:51:08.020]   and then GEICO there or not,
[00:51:08.020 --> 00:51:09.820]   depending on whether the GEICO discount
[00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:13.040]   is better or worse than the bundling discount.
[00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:15.340]   Also, I don't know how to think about the value
[00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:16.780]   of having everything in one place.
[00:51:16.780 --> 00:51:18.540]   There's like this peace of mind
[00:51:18.540 --> 00:51:21.020]   that I wanted going into this process
[00:51:21.020 --> 00:51:23.860]   of, ah, it'd just be nice to have one insurance company
[00:51:23.860 --> 00:51:25.740]   that I could deal with for everything.
[00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:27.460]   And when it came down to it, it was like,
[00:51:27.460 --> 00:51:31.060]   do I wanna pay $800 a year to have that peace of mind?
[00:51:31.060 --> 00:51:33.380]   I'm sure if I went back and talked to Dan Martell,
[00:51:33.380 --> 00:51:37.100]   he would tell me I'm definitely not valuing my time at all,
[00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:39.740]   and that I spent way too much time on this whole project.
[00:51:39.740 --> 00:51:42.260]   But whenever I spend time on this,
[00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:44.740]   I feel like I'm getting a lot of enjoyment,
[00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:46.220]   I'm getting a lot of satisfaction,
[00:51:46.220 --> 00:51:47.720]   but I'm also creating content
[00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:49.340]   that hopefully is valuable to a lot of you.
[00:51:49.340 --> 00:51:53.220]   So the leverage on my time isn't what I can do from it,
[00:51:53.220 --> 00:51:55.040]   but it's the satisfaction of knowing
[00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:56.420]   that hopefully lots of you listening
[00:51:56.420 --> 00:51:58.700]   are gonna save money or be better insured.
[00:51:58.700 --> 00:52:02.580]   And so I feel good about spending 50 hours on this project,
[00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:04.460]   which might only save me $1,000 a year,
[00:52:04.460 --> 00:52:07.020]   but hopefully will save tens or hundreds of thousands
[00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:08.580]   of dollars across everyone listening.
[00:52:08.580 --> 00:52:12.160]   So that is all the major policies that I price regularly
[00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:14.580]   that I just recently went through a process of.
[00:52:14.580 --> 00:52:16.860]   I would absolutely love if anyone listening to this
[00:52:16.860 --> 00:52:19.880]   has questions, thoughts, feedback, things to share.
[00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:21.460]   I'm gonna do a Q&A episode,
[00:52:21.460 --> 00:52:23.780]   and I'm gonna share anything anyone here has heard.
[00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:25.780]   I know there are one-off situations
[00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:26.780]   that can be good or bad.
[00:52:26.780 --> 00:52:27.820]   But if you've had a really bad
[00:52:27.820 --> 00:52:31.420]   or a really great experience with a carrier, let me know,
[00:52:31.420 --> 00:52:32.980]   even if it's just a quick email.
[00:52:32.980 --> 00:52:35.040]   I'll share all the recap learnings
[00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:37.620]   that I've gotten from you all in the next episode.
[00:52:37.620 --> 00:52:40.340]   So definitely do that, chris@allthehacks.com.
[00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:42.700]   You can DM me on social anywhere as well.
[00:52:42.700 --> 00:52:45.300]   I also wanna touch on a few other types of insurance.
[00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:46.640]   So let's jump into it.
[00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:48.780]   Life insurance is one of those important things
[00:52:48.780 --> 00:52:52.700]   that I think can have a huge impact on your spouse,
[00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:55.140]   your family, your children, even your parents sometimes,
[00:52:55.140 --> 00:52:56.660]   should something happen to you.
[00:52:56.660 --> 00:52:59.460]   So its primary goal is to replace the loss
[00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:02.180]   of your future income for anyone you leave behind.
[00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:04.400]   It can also help cover things like funeral expenses
[00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:05.380]   or pay off debt.
[00:53:05.380 --> 00:53:07.020]   And I think if you have young kids
[00:53:07.020 --> 00:53:08.660]   or anyone who really depends on you
[00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:10.380]   and your income to survive,
[00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:12.700]   it's really something you should consider.
[00:53:12.700 --> 00:53:14.380]   And when it comes to what kind,
[00:53:14.380 --> 00:53:16.980]   this is where it gets very confusing,
[00:53:16.980 --> 00:53:19.580]   but I have a very specific point of view.
[00:53:19.580 --> 00:53:20.420]   Term life.
[00:53:20.420 --> 00:53:23.060]   It's a policy that has a limit for how long it's active,
[00:53:23.060 --> 00:53:25.280]   10, 20, 30 years, for example.
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:26.860]   If you pass away within that term,
[00:53:26.860 --> 00:53:29.820]   your beneficiaries get the face value of the policy,
[00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:31.020]   also called a death benefit,
[00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:32.920]   and it's usually tax-free.
[00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:35.440]   And if you pass after the term expires
[00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:37.980]   or you just stop paying your bills, they get nothing.
[00:53:37.980 --> 00:53:40.860]   So if it expires, why would you go with this
[00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:42.300]   when there's these other policies
[00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:44.640]   that are marketed as amazing savings vehicles
[00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:46.320]   that you can earn all this extra money
[00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:49.780]   and save compound tax-free permanent life,
[00:53:49.780 --> 00:53:51.180]   whole life, universal life.
[00:53:51.180 --> 00:53:53.820]   They all market themselves as offering you a benefit
[00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:56.900]   that lasts your whole life and helps you build wealth,
[00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:58.640]   but they have complex rules,
[00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:01.100]   they have high premiums and high fees,
[00:54:01.100 --> 00:54:04.220]   and I think you're almost always better off
[00:54:04.220 --> 00:54:06.620]   taking what you save with those lower premiums
[00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:09.340]   of a term policy and investing the difference
[00:54:09.340 --> 00:54:11.620]   in low-cost index funds yourself
[00:54:11.620 --> 00:54:14.980]   instead of trying to bundle together your life insurance
[00:54:14.980 --> 00:54:16.620]   and your investment savings.
[00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:18.740]   It's not always easy to find that advice.
[00:54:18.740 --> 00:54:20.700]   I think if you look in the right places, you'll get it.
[00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:22.100]   I'll link to a couple articles
[00:54:22.100 --> 00:54:24.340]   from NerdWallet and The White Coat Investor.
[00:54:24.340 --> 00:54:27.540]   The Reddit personal finance group will say the same thing,
[00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:30.440]   but it's hard because permanent, whole,
[00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:34.140]   and universal life policies have such high commissions
[00:54:34.140 --> 00:54:35.300]   that there are so many people
[00:54:35.300 --> 00:54:36.960]   that make so much money selling it
[00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:40.520]   that it is worth all the marketing, all the conversations,
[00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:42.420]   and why it's very easy to find someone
[00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:44.260]   that will try to convince you that it's the best.
[00:54:44.260 --> 00:54:47.700]   But in my personal opinion, term life is great,
[00:54:47.700 --> 00:54:49.340]   and I think that's what I would focus on.
[00:54:49.340 --> 00:54:52.260]   As far as how much to get and for how long,
[00:54:52.260 --> 00:54:54.120]   you don't have to get just one policy.
[00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:56.400]   So a great hack here is called laddering
[00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:58.180]   or layering your policies.
[00:54:58.180 --> 00:55:00.820]   So if you wanna be able to replace your income
[00:55:00.820 --> 00:55:03.580]   until your children are 18,
[00:55:03.580 --> 00:55:05.240]   you're gonna need a lot less money.
[00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:07.460]   Let's say you have one child and they were just born.
[00:55:07.460 --> 00:55:08.660]   If you were to pass away today,
[00:55:08.660 --> 00:55:09.640]   you might need a lot more
[00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:11.820]   than if you were to pass away in 17 years.
[00:55:11.820 --> 00:55:14.540]   So you could get a 20-year policy for one amount
[00:55:14.540 --> 00:55:16.500]   and a 10-year policy for the other,
[00:55:16.500 --> 00:55:19.700]   knowing that by the time your child is 10,
[00:55:19.700 --> 00:55:22.260]   you're not gonna need as much life insurance.
[00:55:22.260 --> 00:55:23.300]   That might be different
[00:55:23.300 --> 00:55:24.900]   depending on how much money you have saved,
[00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:26.060]   whether your spouse works.
[00:55:26.060 --> 00:55:27.260]   There's a lot of questions.
[00:55:27.260 --> 00:55:28.760]   I'll link to a Policy Genius article
[00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:29.600]   that I thought was pretty good
[00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:31.860]   about explaining the laddering policy.
[00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:33.380]   Another thing that could be laddered,
[00:55:33.380 --> 00:55:34.660]   not just your children's ages,
[00:55:34.660 --> 00:55:37.020]   but maybe it's when your mortgage gets paid off,
[00:55:37.020 --> 00:55:39.660]   or maybe when you're eligible for retirement,
[00:55:39.660 --> 00:55:42.220]   or you can tap into your retirement accounts,
[00:55:42.220 --> 00:55:43.620]   your 401ks, your IRAs.
[00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:45.740]   That's generally my advice.
[00:55:45.740 --> 00:55:47.140]   If you're someone who's listening to this
[00:55:47.140 --> 00:55:49.300]   and thinks, "Oh my gosh, I have a permanent life policy
[00:55:49.300 --> 00:55:51.620]   or a whole life or a universal life,"
[00:55:51.620 --> 00:55:52.780]   I don't think it's the end of the world,
[00:55:52.780 --> 00:55:54.580]   but I definitely would look into,
[00:55:54.580 --> 00:55:56.140]   and I'm not the expert here,
[00:55:56.140 --> 00:55:59.020]   what would it cost to cash in on that policy now
[00:55:59.020 --> 00:56:00.160]   and switch to term life?
[00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:02.620]   It's something to consider, but I'm not the expert.
[00:56:02.620 --> 00:56:04.520]   So I don't know whether that's always a good deal,
[00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:05.700]   never a good deal.
[00:56:05.700 --> 00:56:06.660]   I can't answer that.
[00:56:06.660 --> 00:56:08.420]   But if you don't have a policy now,
[00:56:08.420 --> 00:56:10.180]   I would definitely look at term life.
[00:56:10.180 --> 00:56:11.940]   I know when I went through this process
[00:56:11.940 --> 00:56:13.900]   of shopping for insurance policies,
[00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:16.700]   I actually priced out a ton of term life policies.
[00:56:16.700 --> 00:56:18.420]   And part of the reason that I ended up partnering
[00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:20.960]   with Fabric on the show as a sponsor
[00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:24.280]   is because I looked at their policies,
[00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:26.420]   I looked at their reviews, and I looked at their prices,
[00:56:26.420 --> 00:56:27.660]   and they were really competitive.
[00:56:27.660 --> 00:56:28.960]   They also had an A+ rating,
[00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:33.340]   so you can check them out at meetfabric.com/allthehacks.
[00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:35.420]   So that's definitely one option to look at.
[00:56:35.420 --> 00:56:38.060]   There's another great site called Term4Sale,
[00:56:38.060 --> 00:56:41.680]   the number four dot com, so term4sale.com,
[00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:43.940]   which has a bunch of information
[00:56:43.940 --> 00:56:46.480]   about various different term policies and prices, et cetera.
[00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:49.000]   So that's another place to look.
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:50.760]   The pricing isn't that variable,
[00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:54.160]   but it could be as little as a million dollars of coverage
[00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:56.340]   for a dollar a day, and it can go up from there
[00:56:56.340 --> 00:56:58.280]   depending on the term length you have.
[00:56:58.280 --> 00:57:01.000]   Funny enough, when I was comparing the cost of term life
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:03.280]   of a million dollars of coverage to pet insurance,
[00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:04.200]   which I'll cover later,
[00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:06.580]   it was much cheaper to get term life than pet insurance.
[00:57:06.580 --> 00:57:08.780]   So I find that interesting.
[00:57:08.780 --> 00:57:09.800]   I also got a great email,
[00:57:09.800 --> 00:57:12.380]   thank you for writing in from someone
[00:57:12.380 --> 00:57:13.540]   who I don't wanna say their name
[00:57:13.540 --> 00:57:14.440]   'cause I don't wanna call them out,
[00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:16.140]   but they work at a big whole life company,
[00:57:16.140 --> 00:57:17.680]   and they definitely said,
[00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:20.500]   "I do not recommend whole life to the average person."
[00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:21.680]   They said, "If you're really wealthy
[00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:23.480]   and doing some estate planning tactics,
[00:57:23.480 --> 00:57:25.700]   there are some ways that you can use life insurance
[00:57:25.700 --> 00:57:27.800]   to avoid taxes and save money
[00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:29.800]   in a more tax-efficient manner.
[00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:31.920]   But for basic financial security,
[00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:33.980]   they even work at a company that offers this product
[00:57:33.980 --> 00:57:35.160]   and would not recommend it."
[00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:37.820]   I'm not gonna get into the kind of advanced tactics
[00:57:37.820 --> 00:57:40.120]   of using a whole life and universal life
[00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:41.480]   in kind of estate planning,
[00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:43.920]   high net worth tax savings ways,
[00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:45.200]   but for the average person, I think,
[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:47.320]   it's probably not the right policy.
[00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:49.020]   Of course, I'm not an insurance expert.
[00:57:49.020 --> 00:57:51.000]   Do your own work, talk to a professional,
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:52.900]   but just please make sure that professional
[00:57:52.900 --> 00:57:53.840]   doesn't make a commission
[00:57:53.840 --> 00:57:55.680]   selling you permanent, whole, or universal life.
[00:57:55.680 --> 00:57:57.840]   I'll touch briefly, like I said, on pet insurance.
[00:57:57.840 --> 00:57:59.420]   I don't have a strong opinion here,
[00:57:59.420 --> 00:58:00.680]   but I'll share what I learned.
[00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:02.440]   A lot of people seem to think
[00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:04.160]   that if you have an exotic animal
[00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:05.540]   that it requires special care,
[00:58:05.540 --> 00:58:06.760]   or maybe you have a breed
[00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:08.840]   that's really prone to health issues,
[00:58:08.840 --> 00:58:10.480]   it could be more important to others.
[00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:13.080]   The premiums, depending on what kind of coverage you want,
[00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:16.540]   it could be anywhere from 15 to $150 a month,
[00:58:16.540 --> 00:58:18.120]   depending on the age of your pet,
[00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:20.720]   their breed, the species, their health history.
[00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:22.720]   The older the pet, the higher it is.
[00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:25.360]   I've taken the path of self-insurance myself
[00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:28.380]   with our dog, who is about eight now.
[00:58:28.380 --> 00:58:31.320]   We've had years where we've spent $100 for a vet visit,
[00:58:31.320 --> 00:58:33.120]   and we've had years where we spent $1,000
[00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:34.600]   trying to diagnose an issue.
[00:58:34.600 --> 00:58:37.200]   In that $1,000 a year, I kind of thought,
[00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:38.920]   "Oh gosh, should I have gotten pet insurance?"
[00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:40.280]   I reconsidered.
[00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:42.720]   I actually saw a bunch of positive feedback
[00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:43.880]   for Lemonade's pet insurance.
[00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:44.820]   I priced it out.
[00:58:44.820 --> 00:58:45.920]   I thought about it more.
[00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:47.820]   Ultimately, we didn't do it.
[00:58:47.820 --> 00:58:50.540]   But I think that's because this is such a personal decision
[00:58:50.540 --> 00:58:52.760]   that really comes down to how much you'd be willing
[00:58:52.760 --> 00:58:54.700]   to spend on your pet for medical treatment.
[00:58:54.700 --> 00:58:56.360]   If that number is,
[00:58:56.360 --> 00:58:58.640]   if something were wrong with my dog or my cat,
[00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:01.900]   and I would spend anything, $50,000, if that's what it took,
[00:59:01.900 --> 00:59:03.840]   pet insurance might be a better fit for you.
[00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:05.740]   It's also worth noting that it's not always
[00:59:05.740 --> 00:59:07.680]   the kind of reimbursement style insurance.
[00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:09.420]   So you might have to pay for your services up front
[00:59:09.420 --> 00:59:11.160]   and submit your claims.
[00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:13.640]   And depending on the cost of living where you live,
[00:59:13.640 --> 00:59:15.520]   the amount they cover for various things
[00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:16.560]   might not be that much.
[00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:18.660]   I know I just looked at one of these policies yesterday
[00:59:18.660 --> 00:59:21.200]   to brush up, and the amount that they reimbursed
[00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:24.000]   for vet visits was definitely less
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:26.160]   than the vet visit cost in the Bay Area.
[00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:28.000]   So a few things to keep in mind.
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:29.720]   There are a lot of things you can add on
[00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:32.220]   that I would just kind of maybe go look at some vet bills
[00:59:32.220 --> 00:59:34.400]   to try to decide whether they make sense.
[00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:36.440]   Some policies will cover preventative care.
[00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:39.200]   Some policies will cover routine emergency visits
[00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:41.040]   versus major surgeries.
[00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:43.000]   It can add up if you get that policy
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:44.800]   that I looked up for our dog with everything,
[00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:46.760]   preventative care, lower deductibles.
[00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:49.360]   It was almost $150 a month, which is quite expensive.
[00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:50.360]   If you have strong opinions
[00:59:50.360 --> 00:59:52.480]   or you've had good or bad experiences on pet insurance
[00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:54.200]   on any of these policies, let me know,
[00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:57.120]   'cause I wanna do a recap in the Q&A episode
[00:59:57.120 --> 00:59:59.900]   in a week or two covering feedback from you all,
[00:59:59.900 --> 01:00:02.080]   because I've learned so much from everyone listening.
[01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:04.360]   So I'd love to get that added to this episode.
[01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:06.720]   I'll talk quickly about disability insurance.
[01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:09.960]   Anyone at any age can become disabled or unable to work.
[01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:10.800]   It could be from illness.
[01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:12.200]   It could be from injury.
[01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:14.520]   While I don't love this stat, it was the best I found.
[01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:19.120]   Before reaching the age of 67, if you're 20 now,
[01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:20.280]   there's a one in four chance
[01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:22.160]   that you might become disabled at some point.
[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:23.280]   Now, is that at 66?
[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:24.420]   Is that at 30?
[01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:25.360]   It doesn't know.
[01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:27.120]   I just think it's something to keep in mind
[01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:29.020]   that it might be more common than you think.
[01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:30.960]   That doesn't mean you'd be disabled your whole life.
[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:33.040]   I know I had foot surgery once
[01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:35.960]   and I was gonna be out for six or eight weeks,
[01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:37.600]   and it turns out it was more tax efficient
[01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:41.160]   to go on short-term disability than to not, so I did that,
[01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:44.160]   but I probably would be included in that statistic.
[01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:46.120]   But there are a lot of circumstances
[01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:48.440]   where that situation of disability
[01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:50.720]   could have a huge impact on your financial life,
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:53.280]   and you wanna be covered should you have an accident
[01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:55.340]   or a sudden illness that would prevent you from working.
[01:00:55.340 --> 01:00:56.420]   So there's two types.
[01:00:56.420 --> 01:00:57.520]   There's short-term disability,
[01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:59.440]   which is usually up to six months,
[01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:02.520]   and long-term disability that can cover you for years
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:03.920]   or even until you retire,
[01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:06.520]   but usually has a waiting period of three to 12 months
[01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:07.400]   before it kicks in,
[01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:09.720]   where short-term disability would be there.
[01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:12.200]   You might have some coverage through your employers
[01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:15.040]   or through a state fund like we have in California.
[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:16.140]   While those funds might say
[01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:18.200]   they recover 60 to 80% of your income,
[01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:20.420]   they often have weekly or monthly caps
[01:01:20.420 --> 01:01:22.280]   that might result in them replacing
[01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:24.600]   a much smaller percentage of your income.
[01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:26.180]   So if those policies aren't enough
[01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:28.060]   and what you have from work isn't enough
[01:01:28.060 --> 01:01:30.040]   and people really depend on your income,
[01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:31.800]   it could be worth having a supplemental
[01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:33.800]   or even full policy on your own.
[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:35.840]   If you have enough of an emergency fund
[01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:38.300]   to cover your full income for three to six months,
[01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:39.580]   which I generally recommend,
[01:01:39.580 --> 01:01:40.720]   you might be able to self-insure
[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:42.400]   your short-term disability needs,
[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:43.940]   or at least self-insure the difference
[01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:46.040]   between the coverage you have and your full income,
[01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:48.160]   whether that's from work or from the state.
[01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:49.800]   But unless you're financially independent,
[01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:51.760]   you probably won't be able to self-insure
[01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:53.240]   against the chance that you become disabled
[01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:55.320]   for a really long time.
[01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:56.920]   So if you don't have a policy through work,
[01:01:56.920 --> 01:01:59.140]   definitely look into whether this might be
[01:01:59.140 --> 01:02:00.300]   a good option for you.
[01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:02.240]   Look into what your state and your work offers
[01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:03.920]   and try to look at what you would need
[01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:05.820]   to kind of be comfortable until retirement,
[01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:08.920]   taking into account your spouse's income and all that.
[01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:11.080]   I did some research last year for my newsletter
[01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:13.200]   and a Guardian and MassMutual came up
[01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:16.800]   as two top providers for long-term disability,
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:18.940]   but I don't have any experience with either.
[01:02:18.940 --> 01:02:19.980]   It's also worth pointing out
[01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:23.020]   there is a social security disability insurance
[01:02:23.020 --> 01:02:25.860]   that comes from all the social security tax you pay
[01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:27.080]   from your paycheck each month.
[01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:28.880]   You do have to have paid into these services
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:30.520]   for a certain amount of time to use them,
[01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:33.760]   but usually that's 40 credits, which you get each quarter.
[01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:35.740]   So it's about 10 years of employment.
[01:02:35.740 --> 01:02:37.280]   You can always go to the social security website
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:38.680]   and see how many credits you've earned.
[01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:41.860]   But I will say that the maximum benefit you can receive
[01:02:41.860 --> 01:02:45.280]   is kind of in the three to $4,000 range per month.
[01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:46.320]   So depending on where you live,
[01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:48.920]   that might not be enough to cover your life,
[01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:50.520]   but you could also factor in
[01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:52.260]   whether you'd be willing to move
[01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:54.200]   or what kind of changes you'd be able to make
[01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:55.520]   in a situation like this.
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:56.840]   So that's something to think about.
[01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:59.520]   Last, I'll touch on travel insurance.
[01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:00.820]   In the past few years,
[01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:03.220]   airlines have been pushing travel insurance so hard
[01:03:03.220 --> 01:03:05.420]   that I feel like I've gotten lots of questions.
[01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:07.940]   And every time you check out from a website
[01:03:07.940 --> 01:03:09.000]   buying an airline ticket, it's like,
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:09.960]   "Do you want the travel insurance?
[01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:11.260]   "Do you want the travel insurance?"
[01:03:11.260 --> 01:03:13.600]   Most of those travel insurances cover things
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:15.860]   like delayed lost bags, trips delays,
[01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:17.960]   cancellations, interruptions, that kind of stuff,
[01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:20.680]   maybe medical evacuation, rental car damage.
[01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:22.760]   Almost all of those are things that you get
[01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:24.800]   from a great travel credit card.
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:28.760]   So I'll link to an example of the guide to benefits
[01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:30.020]   for the Chase Sapphire Reserve,
[01:03:30.020 --> 01:03:32.560]   but you should definitely look at your travel card
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:35.040]   and see what kind of benefits those include.
[01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:37.040]   I don't think I've done a full episode.
[01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:37.880]   Maybe I should.
[01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:40.820]   Let me know if you want one on a guide to all the benefits.
[01:03:40.820 --> 01:03:42.180]   I know I've written a newsletter about it.
[01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:43.660]   I'll link to it in the show notes,
[01:03:43.660 --> 01:03:46.000]   but just walking through all the credit card benefits
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.760]   you might have, whether they need to be supplemented
[01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:51.600]   or whether they're enough, how to use them, et cetera.
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:53.720]   That's kind of how I think about a lot of the policies
[01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:56.120]   that are being sold as you're checking out from an airline.
[01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:58.400]   I've never accepted those policies,
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:00.880]   but policies worth considering are
[01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:02.360]   if your health insurance doesn't cover you
[01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:03.440]   when you're traveling abroad,
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:04.640]   definitely look at a policy
[01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:06.760]   that covers medical treatment abroad.
[01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:09.160]   If you're worried about getting stuck abroad
[01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:11.040]   with medical situations and you want something
[01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:13.380]   that will cover a flight back,
[01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:15.800]   you can get medical evacuation insurance.
[01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:19.640]   The policy I have gotten and I did get during the pandemic
[01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:21.680]   was a policy from Trawick.
[01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:23.800]   They had this policy called Safe Travels Voyager.
[01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:25.560]   I've purchased it a few times.
[01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:28.020]   It covers more than you will get
[01:04:28.020 --> 01:04:29.280]   if you have a circumstance
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:30.740]   that your credit card would cover.
[01:04:30.740 --> 01:04:32.640]   Things like if you need to quarantine somewhere,
[01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:33.780]   it'll cover your hotel.
[01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:37.040]   If you need to get back to the US, it'll often cover you.
[01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:39.080]   But if you really wanna get back to the US
[01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:41.320]   and you want like no questions asked,
[01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:42.880]   get me home immediately,
[01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:45.160]   there's a company called Kovac Global
[01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:46.940]   that is pretty expensive,
[01:04:46.940 --> 01:04:50.500]   somewhere on the order of like $600 per person for a trip,
[01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:52.860]   but they will charter you a private flight and get you home
[01:04:52.860 --> 01:04:55.700]   even if it's just testing positive for COVID.
[01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:57.520]   So that's something to consider.
[01:04:57.520 --> 01:04:59.600]   And then if you're doing a bunch of adventure activities,
[01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:02.000]   a lot of basic travel insurance policies,
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.380]   maybe even your health insurance policy might not cover you.
[01:05:04.380 --> 01:05:07.280]   In years past, I've used a company called World Nomads
[01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:08.640]   to cover those activities.
[01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:10.160]   I haven't done it recently,
[01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:11.900]   I think probably 'cause I haven't been doing as much
[01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:13.440]   rock climbing on our travels.
[01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:16.180]   And then last, if you're going on any kind of trip
[01:05:16.180 --> 01:05:17.120]   that's really expensive,
[01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:19.580]   I had a friend that went on a cruise to the Galapagos
[01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:21.680]   and their connecting flights
[01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:23.520]   made it such that they missed their flight.
[01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:24.920]   It was not a great circumstance.
[01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:26.160]   So if you're doing anything
[01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:28.480]   where it's a very expensive endeavor,
[01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:29.680]   like a Galapagos cruise,
[01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:31.480]   I would definitely double check
[01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:33.300]   that you have something to protect you
[01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:35.340]   in case your flight gets canceled or delayed
[01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:36.740]   and you can't make the boat,
[01:05:36.740 --> 01:05:38.440]   or something happens, you get sick,
[01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:41.120]   whether that's your credit card policy or another policy,
[01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:43.320]   you'd really not wanna miss the departure
[01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:44.600]   of a very expensive trip.
[01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:46.800]   So that's all the policies I wanted to cover
[01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:47.840]   for this episode.
[01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:49.940]   I know that's a lot of information.
[01:05:49.940 --> 01:05:52.180]   Maybe I'll put together a recap newsletter.
[01:05:52.180 --> 01:05:53.380]   I know I've done two in the past
[01:05:53.380 --> 01:05:54.460]   that I'll link to in the show notes
[01:05:54.460 --> 01:05:56.380]   that had a good amount of this information,
[01:05:56.380 --> 01:05:58.220]   but I really hope it was helpful.
[01:05:58.220 --> 01:05:59.920]   I'll just recap some of these tips.
[01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:01.560]   So definitely shop around,
[01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:04.760]   definitely read through the policy terms and understand them.
[01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:06.260]   Definitely consider whether it makes sense
[01:06:06.260 --> 01:06:07.700]   to up your deductibles.
[01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:08.820]   That is something that I think
[01:06:08.820 --> 01:06:10.540]   I've lowered a lot of my insurance costs
[01:06:10.540 --> 01:06:11.740]   by getting more comfortable
[01:06:11.740 --> 01:06:14.700]   with just setting aside some money in an emergency fund
[01:06:14.700 --> 01:06:17.880]   instead of having to rely on a low deductible,
[01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:20.160]   and definitely document everything in your house
[01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:21.100]   just in case.
[01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:22.280]   And finally, like I said,
[01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:24.040]   I hope we never have any of these issues.
[01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:26.720]   I hope you don't have a car accident or a flooded basement,
[01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:28.740]   but realistically these things happen.
[01:06:28.740 --> 01:06:31.520]   So I hope that this episode was helpful.
[01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:33.240]   I hope that you picked up a lot of tips.
[01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:35.800]   I hope that you can use it to protect yourself adequately
[01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:36.900]   and save some money.
[01:06:36.900 --> 01:06:39.840]   Thank you so much for listening.
[01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:42.320]   If you found this valuable, send it to a friend.
[01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:44.240]   The highest praise that you could give me
[01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:45.560]   for any of the work I'm doing
[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:47.600]   is to help bring new people to the podcast.
[01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:50.080]   So if you know someone that wants to save money
[01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:52.000]   or adequately insure themselves,
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.600]   send them this episode, tell them to have a listen,
[01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:56.240]   tell them to reach out if they have questions.
[01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:57.720]   I would love to be helpful
[01:06:57.720 --> 01:06:59.760]   and find ways to help you all save more
[01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:00.960]   and be better insured.
[01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:01.800]   So that's it.
[01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:02.680]   Thank you for listening.
[01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:03.960]   I will see you next week.
[01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:07.240]   (upbeat music)
[01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:09.560]   (whooshing)
[01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:19.560]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
