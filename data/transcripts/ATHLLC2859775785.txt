[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.700]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.880]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.940]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.200]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, Longangle.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.240]   Longangle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.060]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.620]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.460]   I'm a member of Longangle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on All The Hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.660]   Now, the majority of Longangle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.320]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.280]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.240]   children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.160]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.440]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.000]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out Longangle and it's totally
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.140]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.960]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.640]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:42.000]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.760]   your life, money, and travel.
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.080]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I am excited you're joining me today for a
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.200]   conversation with Mike Hayes, who happens to have one of the most impressive
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.760]   resumes I have ever seen.
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.440]   He spent 20 years in the US Navy SEALs serving around the world, including the
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.760]   conflicts in Bosnia, Kosovo, Iraq, and Afghanistan.
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:08.360]   His last job in the Navy was the commanding officer of SEAL Team 2, overseeing a
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.280]   2,000-person special operations task force in southeastern Afghanistan.
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.600]   Before that, he was a White House fellow and served as director of defense policy
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.040]   and strategy at the National Security Council.
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.520]   And after his military career, Mike spent four years at the investment firm
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.000]   Bridgewater before moving into the tech sector, where he's now the chief digital
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.160]   transformation officer at VMware.
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.280]   And just last year, he published his first book, Never Enough, which is about
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.360]   living a life of excellence, agility, and meaning.
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.960]   Oh, and if that's not enough, he's also fluent in German and Spanish.
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.760]   In our conversation, I want to unpack everything he's learned about leadership,
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.480]   decision-making, handling difficult situations, manufacturing discomfort, and
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.560]   what it takes to embrace the principles of excellence, agility, and meaning.
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.280]   I am so excited for this conversation, so let's jump in.
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.520]   Mike, thank you for being here.
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.080]   It's an honor to speak with you.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.400]   Thank you for your service.
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.720]   Chris, the honor's mine.
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.440]   It's so awesome to be around people who have made this great nation greater.
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.640]   Thanks for having me here today.
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.040]   I'm just going to jump in.
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.400]   In the intro to your book, you laid out these three principles, excellence, agility,
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.280]   and meaning, and you say they cover the spectrum of what we need to aim for in
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.320]   everything we do.
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.480]   So first off, thanks for boiling the entire ocean of life down to three
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.200]   principles.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.600]   But more importantly, what led you narrow the world of potential principles down to
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.320]   these three?
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.240]   Well, man alive, I think if you understand me, the famous words of a
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.600]   pictatist, the Stoic philosopher, he said, when somebody criticizes you, the only
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.800]   correct answer is to say, clearly you don't know me well enough, or if you knew
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.040]   me better, you would criticize me for my far greater faults.
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.840]   So anyways, the three things, excellence, agility, and meaning, I have to start
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:57.520]   with the last one.
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.160]   I've recently gone over the half century mark, and all that does is means that I've
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.920]   messed some things up in life and got wisdom from things that I could have done
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:04.280]   better.
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.280]   One thing I'm very confident in though, that is the world is about meaning.
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.640]   It's how do you find purpose?
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:10.680]   How do you have impact?
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.080]   How do you make a difference?
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.720]   I've been very, very fortunate in my life to be around a bunch of people who the
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.200]   world would deem and define as ultra successful.
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.560]   And from all of these conversations, I will tell you that every single person
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.440]   will, no matter how much money or how rich and famous they are, they will tell
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.240]   you that their life is the richest when they're giving back and they're making a
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.120]   difference for others.
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.080]   And the seals are in two white houses.
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.960]   I've been very privileged to be able to give back.
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.760]   I've been through some hard days also, many hard days, like every seal of my era
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.760]   has, but I have to start with the meaning aspect of that because everybody has to
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.920]   find their own reason for being here.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.640]   That's number one.
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.040]   And then you say, how do you do that?
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.240]   So meaning is kind of the what, the how is really focusing on excellence and
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.800]   agility.
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.320]   The excellence, I've often said, we're only excellent if we know we're never
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.240]   excellent enough.
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.280]   And please don't mishear me.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.440]   It's like the title of the book, Never Enough can get interpreted as not
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.400]   positive enough or not good enough.
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.240]   And no, no, no, no, no.
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.640]   It's about always striving to be a little bit better, but at the same time being
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:10.880]   satisfied with who we are.
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.920]   I know that sounds a little bit paradoxical, but really the point is
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.040]   excellence is about drive and determination to continue to get better.
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.600]   I spent a whole third of the book on that.
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.160]   The third one, I would say agility, look, that's about dropping into a situation
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.320]   and understanding that you need to be different things and have different tools
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.720]   in the toolkit and be able to approach life different ways in order to, to
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.240]   create that meaning and impact.
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.120]   So the first is the what and the other two are the how, Chris.
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.640]   That makes so much sense.
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.200]   I've been fortunate to read the book.
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.920]   Got it right here.
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.520]   Thank you for sending me a copy.
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.240]   What I will say is.
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:49.560]   Now that I've read it, I understand it, but I think some people might read the
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.680]   intro, read the beginning and think, wow, so many of these principles that you
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:58.000]   share involve these wild life and death situations, and they might not feel
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.680]   relatable.
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.600]   Do you think that those lessons can still be taken in and used when stakes aren't
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.080]   as high?
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.720]   A hundred percent.
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:06.000]   Yes.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.680]   If there's any way to judge whether the book has been successful or not, it is
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.720]   the question of relatability, because look, we all choose different paths in
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:14.040]   life.
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:17.720]   I've gone to seals and worked in white houses, and now I'm a senior executive
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:18.600]   in a public company.
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.240]   And so that doesn't mean my path is the right path.
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.320]   Everybody's got different passions and abilities and interests.
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:28.080]   And if I wrote something that only pertained to people who have followed
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.120]   similar paths to mine, then I wouldn't be achieving the goal of the book, which
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:37.520]   is to try to make as positive of an impact in as many people as possible lives.
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.440]   So that's really what I've aspired to do.
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:44.680]   I think that no matter where you are, the principles that engender and cause the
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:49.440]   success in the seals or the white houses or wherever you are, are really the same
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:49.600]   thing.
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.160]   No matter what somebody chooses to do in life, whether you're being a better
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:58.320]   father or a husband or a better neighbor or a better person on your town board or
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:02.240]   a nonprofit board, like it just doesn't matter what path people choose.
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.760]   In fact, it's very important.
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:07.440]   And what I write about this is to celebrate that we all are motivated by
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:08.200]   different things.
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:12.200]   We all have different passions and interests and abilities, and people who
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:15.280]   choose different paths than us should be celebrated because that's what takes the
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.120]   world to go around.
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.680]   And so I've really aspired.
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:18.640]   I leave it to the readers.
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.840]   You can skim through the Amazon reviews, but I think you'd come to the conclusion
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:25.240]   that there's a lot of positivity around making the book relatable.
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.640]   So I do hope people find it that way.
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:31.960]   Before we jump in, maybe let's just take an example of your first life and death
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:36.640]   experience in Peru and what that taught you about doing the right thing and what
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:37.600]   people can take away from that.
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:38.560]   Absolutely.
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:44.200]   So, like I said, I'm, I'm 51 years old when I was 26 or so, 25, 1996.
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:45.040]   So I was 23 years old.
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:50.160]   I was leading a group of seals on my first overseas assignment in Peru.
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.480]   There were six or eight of us.
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:55.040]   And honestly, it was just an evening where six of my teammates had flown
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:55.600]   forward.
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:59.400]   They were out in a Quito's actually, which is an offshoot of the river Nanai,
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:03.440]   which feeds into the Amazon in the rainforest and myself and a friend of
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:06.000]   mine, Ken, we're just getting a meal together.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.040]   And when we were driving back home, these two police cars pinned us in six
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.320]   guys jumped out heavily armed right away.
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:16.720]   And Ken and I were like, okay, these cops, they just have us mistaken for
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:17.400]   somebody else.
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:18.960]   But we were wrong.
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.560]   They were either heavy criminals or terrorists.
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:24.520]   We still, to this day, don't know which they were, but they drove us around.
[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:27.640]   They threatened me with execution and torture and really bad things.
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:31.480]   And fortunately I'm fluent in Spanish and I was able to communicate and just
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:32.960]   say, Hey, look, we're just desk workers.
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:33.760]   We're economists.
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:37.480]   Your brain in these life and death situations becomes a supercomputer.
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:39.320]   Everything just slows down.
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:42.880]   And you're just thinking, okay, how do I maximize the probability of living
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:43.960]   through this situation?
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.080]   We weren't armed, et cetera.
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.120]   I could have jumped out of the car and saved my life.
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:52.320]   But I remember very vividly, Chris thinking, if I jump out of this car and
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.600]   save my life, they're probably going to shoot Ken.
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:59.040]   And I could never, ever live my life knowing that I caused harm to a teammate
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:08:59.440]   like that.
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.880]   So we stuck it out, ultimately lived through it.
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.200]   I learned a couple of things.
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:06.960]   Number one is when I was very near death, all I did was think about the time, my
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.760]   fiance, now wife of 25 years.
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.640]   And you just think about the people who you care about in life.
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:16.840]   And honestly, this will sound weird, but like death for yourself isn't that hard.
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:20.000]   I have had several near death experiences.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   And what I have found is that you think about the people who you are closest to.
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:27.760]   So number one is first and foremost, it's cliche for a reason, but live every day
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:28.560]   like it's your last.
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:29.560]   Leave nothing unsaid.
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:32.960]   Make sure you never miss an opportunity to tell people how important they are to
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.520]   you and to be the best person you can be.
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.280]   Quick to forgive, patience.
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:41.440]   Look, I'm imperfect like we all are, but aspire to be as least imperfect as we can
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.120]   be every day.
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.640]   That's one set of learnings.
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:46.600]   The other is more, I'll say tactical, if you will.
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:51.400]   Like in these situations, how do you very simply think, okay, what's the outcome
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.720]   that you want, what's the strategy that's going to get you there, and then how do
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:55.760]   you perform in the moment?
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:01.080]   And that's very simply what life as a SEAL is, and that was foreshadowing for
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.240]   decades of conflict.
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:08.080]   When things get really hard, how do you stay extremely calm and see the outcomes
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:11.960]   and say, what needs to happen here in this hard moment in order to maximize the
[00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:15.040]   safety and success of my teammates and myself?
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:18.640]   So lots of learning from a very hard situation at a young age, Chris.
[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:19.580]   Wow.
[00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:23.920]   Is there any training you got for slowing down in those moments that you could
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:25.360]   share that might be helpful to people?
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:29.480]   I know some people get a little anxious when things are distraught.
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:30.440]   It takes practice.
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.480]   There's another question behind your question, which is people can hear me
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.840]   sometimes and think, wow, this guy's really got it together.
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:37.080]   He knows how the world works.
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.360]   I'd say look false.
[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:40.760]   I'm figuring it out just like everybody else.
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:44.840]   But what I would say is that the nature versus nurture question, how much of
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:48.960]   ability is nature and just, hey, you were born with a certain ability, and
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:52.160]   how much of it is nurture, how much is trained and learned and improved.
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:56.680]   And look, I think that way more of life is the nurture, the training than the
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:11:00.240]   nature aspect, because it's just a matter of how good do you want to get at
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:03.720]   something and then what's the work that it takes to get there and are you willing
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.560]   to pay the cost of that work to get there?
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:10.280]   In SEAL training, my class started with 120 guys, 19 graduated.
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:14.680]   Now all 220 who came in the front door had the physical ability to be a SEAL.
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:18.760]   And the 19 who graduated also had the mental ability to be a SEAL.
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:22.800]   The mental aspect of these situations is really what determines the
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:24.560]   great outcomes and the success, Chris.
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:29.400]   What you need to do is put yourself in hard situations, ideally in training,
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:33.760]   and then afterward, don't spend time talking about what went well.
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:37.640]   Spend time talking about what didn't go well enough, because the next
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:41.640]   time you do something, inertia will keep that goodness remaining good.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.200]   What you need to do is arrest or change the direction around the things
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:46.400]   that aren't going well enough.
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:50.160]   Let me use an example, a SEAL platoon in the States training
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:51.560]   to go overseas and deploy.
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:54.760]   It's not training if we're just go out every night and we succeed
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:55.840]   and do everything perfectly.
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:59.320]   As a commanding officer of a SEAL team, if I just see people succeeding
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:02.480]   night after night after night, I'll say, "Hey, your training's not hard enough."
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:07.320]   So that failure and the coming up short is where all the learning comes from.
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:10.040]   So then in that, and I'm sorry, this is a long answer, but I'm
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:11.800]   passionate about this topic, Chris.
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:16.920]   The learning comes from the after action review or the hot wash or the debrief,
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:20.160]   we call it, where we go around and say, "What could have been done better?"
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:23.440]   And what's really important, and I wrote about this in the book, is you
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:24.920]   don't teach people what to learn.
[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:28.960]   You teach people how to learn, not what to think, how to think.
[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:31.240]   The how is what's replicable.
[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:34.440]   You know, when you're in a village in the middle of Iraq or Afghanistan,
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:37.600]   which I and many SEALs have been in the dark of the night many, many times,
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.480]   you're never going to see the exact same situation twice.
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:44.720]   So to say that you came out of a building and turned left and say, "Oh,
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:47.760]   you should have turned right," and think that that's the debrief, false.
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:51.160]   What you want to do is get the logic underneath it and say, "Why did you turn
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:52.120]   left? What did you see?
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.360]   What was going through your head?"
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:59.160]   And unpack that because that lesson at that level, at that deeper why, will
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:02.840]   absolutely be used again on an operation in the future, and that's where you can
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:06.480]   say, "Hey, you know, you turned left and here's why, but did you think about the
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:09.320]   other side and maybe you should have thought about it a different way, or
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:12.480]   maybe I should have thought about it a different way?" And being in a culture
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:16.800]   where that behavior is celebrated as trying to make each other better, not
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:21.480]   tearing each other down, but making the team stronger is really the reason that
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:22.920]   all of the greatness happens.
[00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:27.360]   You're now working in a technology industry that I've spent a lot of time
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:32.000]   in. Have you used that same principle to the way you debrief situations there?
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.880]   And is there a similar example using what you learned in a different
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:36.760]   professional environment?
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:41.640]   Absolutely. I will say that the corporate environment, the delivery of the
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:44.240]   feedback has to be rangier, if you will.
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:49.240]   We've got a wider variety of backgrounds and people in the real world.
[00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:52.680]   And I don't mean that just from your classic dichotomies that we have in the
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:57.560]   world. The corporate environment, what we think about is how do we deliver the
[00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:01.360]   message so that it is the maximum probability of growth happens?
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.840]   And that really is one thing.
[00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:06.520]   It's do you care about the person you're giving the feedback to?
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:10.960]   All of us, whether it's you or me or anybody listening, if we get criticized,
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:12.720]   well, let me not even use the word criticized.
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:18.400]   If we get feedback, we have a really good radar and a detector to be able to tell
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:22.640]   whether the person delivering the feedback is coming from a space of make me
[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:24.120]   better or tear me down.
[00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:28.040]   And we tend to respond really well when we genuinely feel like somebody is trying
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:31.520]   to make us better. We don't respond well when somebody is just trying to tear us
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:35.480]   down. So if you think about that, on how do you deliver feedback, it has to come
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:38.720]   from the space of caring and helping the team.
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:41.920]   And look, I haven't found many people in the corporate world who don't want to be
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:45.640]   better. Nobody wakes up and says, what can I screw up today as a society become a
[00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:48.000]   little bit better with a lifelong of learning?
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.440]   Absolutely. In the book, you talked about an experience where how to think
[00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:54.280]   actually was all that mattered.
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:59.720]   And you kind of had to, in a more professional environment, use only how to
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:02.360]   think because you didn't really have much context on what was happening.
[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:02.880]   Is that fair?
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:07.240]   That's fair. I was privileged to be selected as a White House fellow.
[00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:12.160]   I served the last six months of the Bush administration and then served into the
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:16.280]   Obama administration and as the director for defense policy and strategy.
[00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:20.360]   So I reported to the National Security Advisor and I've either run or attended
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.440]   hundreds of meetings in the White House Situation Room.
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:26.800]   And I've seen the best our nation has, the brightest minds solving the hardest of
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:31.640]   problems. But, Chris, there's an inverse of that, which is also egos and desire for
[00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:35.640]   credit, lack of humility or having the meeting after the meeting, you know, those
[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:38.080]   kinds of cultures getting in the way of progress.
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:41.640]   And so on day seven, I wrote about this in the book, a little bit of spoiler alert.
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:45.720]   But day seven or 10 or something like that in the White House, I had to unstick the
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:48.520]   START treaty that the interagency could not agree on.
[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:52.200]   So Department of Defense and Department of State and Energy and the intelligence
[00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:56.320]   community, they all want a different language in our text for the treaty.
[00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:59.440]   And all I had to do was get everybody in the sit room and say, all right, we got to
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:02.880]   come to an agreement here. And that's the how that you just described.
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:06.160]   Like I stood in front of the room and I said, look, there's 15 minutes of Washington,
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.280]   D.C. standing in front of you running this meeting.
[00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:11.200]   And there's 150 plus years of Washington, D.C.
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.280]   experience in this room.
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:16.160]   And what I can tell you is that I'm really good at keeping these doors shut until we
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:19.960]   figure this out. And my other observation is that everybody in D.C.
[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:22.360]   wants to play the my dad can beat up your dad game.
[00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:23.720]   Let's not agree at the table here.
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:25.440]   We go back to our home organizations.
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:28.840]   We tell our boss that nobody wants to agree with us and we think somebody else is
[00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:30.000]   going to sort out our problems.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.960]   And so my response was simple.
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:37.840]   I said, hey, if you think your boss is smarter than you on this topic right now,
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:39.360]   please raise your hand.
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:41.480]   And of course, nobody raised their hand.
[00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:42.680]   A little bit of a logic trap there.
[00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:44.080]   Right, Chris? I said, OK, great.
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.040]   So we've got the smartest people in Washington, D.C.
[00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:47.800]   in this room to go solve this issue.
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:50.560]   It's our responsibility as a nation to go solve it.
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:55.160]   And so on, I don't know, day 20 or something, I was privileged to fly overseas with
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:58.760]   White House delegation and be part of the leadership negotiating across the table from
[00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:00.640]   the Russians in 2008.
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:03.760]   So the how they're like you said, matters way more than the what.
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:08.040]   Absolutely. You just talked about the Situation Room, and I think it's something that
[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:10.560]   everyone has seen in a show, in a movie.
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:15.240]   Any fun tidbits of information you can share of what's it actually like to be in that
[00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:19.080]   room? Is it what we all expect from watching whatever TV show we've seen?
[00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:24.720]   On the one hand, the electronics and the communications is always state of the art.
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:27.960]   I haven't been in that room in a couple of years, but it's always getting better.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.200]   And just even from when I was in there, I've let a couple of things in there where we
[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:34.040]   had different places from around the globe plugged in.
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:37.040]   And you've got people on the nerve center, if you will, of the nation.
[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:39.760]   And it's super cool. In fact, actually, here's a good way to say it.
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:43.240]   My swim buddy from SEAL training later became an astronaut, Chris Cassidy.
[00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:44.880]   He's one of my greatest friends on the planet.
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:49.560]   Chris flew the second to last shuttle mission and then also did two deployments to the
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:50.760]   International Space Station.
[00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:54.920]   When Chris went on his first shuttle mission, I flew down with my family to go watch it
[00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:57.000]   launch live. It was delayed a couple of times.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.600]   And we couldn't stay down in Cape Canaveral any longer.
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:01.280]   I went back to D.C.
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.240]   His blast off was during the workday.
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:04.520]   There was not a meeting in the room.
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:06.280]   And I talked to the people on watch.
[00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:09.480]   We call it and I said, hey, can we just get the launch up on one of the screens?
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.080]   And they were like, absolutely, sir.
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:14.680]   Once the shuttle's up and in orbit, would you like us to patch a call into your friend,
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:18.920]   Chris? And I was just like, oh, my God, this is incredible.
[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:20.760]   No way would I possibly do that.
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:24.880]   That'll be like some national story of a misappropriation or misuse of authority or
[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:29.000]   abilities. But the ability to go from White House sit room to space shuttle with two SEAL
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.840]   training friends from age 21 would have been super cool.
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:33.440]   Wow, that's great.
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:38.760]   I want to go back to what you were talking about earlier, about trying to put yourself
[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:44.000]   in training. Now, I would argue that maybe the SEALs Buds training is one of the
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.280]   hardest, if not the hardest training programs that exists on the Earth.
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:52.800]   How do you think mere mortals like me can, without enlisting in the SEALs, create some
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:57.400]   of that training and kind of bring on this practice you described as like manufacturing
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:01.520]   discomfort in their lives for people who've grown up in really hard situations?
[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:04.720]   They know it for people who maybe have grown up a little bit more privileged.
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:09.600]   Maybe they haven't had that discomfort and want to, but maybe don't want to go run
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:13.560]   through Buds. I think it starts with being really clear what your goals are in life.
[00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:17.800]   You know, a lot of us just kind of tend to drift a little bit and say, I'm just going to
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:22.200]   go do these things to step back from time to time and say, why am I doing what I'm
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:25.240]   doing? And what is the impact that I want to have going back to that meaning
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:26.760]   conversation we had at the beginning?
[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:30.440]   So then you say, OK, I want to achieve a certain thing.
[00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:32.360]   What's the work that it takes to go do that?
[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:37.560]   And a lot of times we don't try the harder things because we have this subconscious
[00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:42.240]   like fear of failure or, hey, I might look bad if I try something really hard and fail.
[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:46.160]   Chris, I think the reframing in the brain that has to happen and to some degree
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:52.120]   cultures in an organization has to say, if you fail and learn, you have just succeeded.
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:54.680]   If you fail and don't learn, you've totally failed.
[00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:58.200]   And so it's easy to celebrate what is clearly success.
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:01.520]   But do we celebrate failure and learning enough in society?
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:06.120]   That's where I think that we as humans who don't try the hard things tend to not
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:11.480]   recognize that if we try really hard things, the people who are around are probably
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:15.200]   going to celebrate the fact that we tried something really hard and we learned.
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:18.240]   If they don't, then we're around the wrong people.
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:23.280]   So thinking forward in a hard situation and saying, OK, really, no kidding.
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:27.280]   What are the people who actually matter to me going to think if I try this and it
[00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:31.840]   doesn't go well? Like, do spend that mental energy and you'll find out that, oh, my
[00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:34.160]   gosh, you know what? My family and friends are going to think less of me.
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:38.640]   Great. Let me go try to build a podcast with a million or 10 million followers or
[00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:40.520]   whatever it is that people choose to do.
[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:43.680]   So that I think is really important is to be comfortable.
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:47.440]   I also wrote about the concepts of confidence and humility.
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:52.040]   A lot of people see those as a point on a single line when in reality you have
[00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:56.600]   confidence and humility are two different axes and you have to try to aspire to live
[00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:01.760]   in that highly confident and highly humble quadrant because those can simultaneously
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:06.280]   coexist. I believe ultimately, Chris, it's about not being worried about fear of
[00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:08.440]   failure and leaning into the harder path.
[00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:12.520]   On an episode recently, we were talking about health, completely different
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:17.160]   conversation, but Liz Moody, who I interviewed, said she liked manufacturing
[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:18.240]   discomfort in her life.
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:22.680]   And so for her, every day before she gets out of the shower, she just throws it on
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:26.280]   the coldest it gets and stands there for 60 seconds because it makes her feel like
[00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:29.280]   she did something hard and she thinks that's a good skill to have.
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:34.000]   Is there anything you think in your experience that you could tell someone
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:39.160]   listening that they could try today or tomorrow in their life to manufacture just
[00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:43.080]   a little bit of discomfort, maybe that isn't a cold shower, to try to just build
[00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:44.240]   that tolerance for it?
[00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:47.040]   Awesome. Yes. And I've got a couple of things to throw at you.
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:48.520]   Some things are super simple.
[00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:50.680]   How long can you do a plank for?
[00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:52.200]   Just think whatever that number is.
[00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:54.840]   I don't care if it's one second or a minute or 10 minutes.
[00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:59.080]   Go do it for 10 percent longer or 5 percent longer than you think you can.
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:01.280]   And live in that struggle.
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:05.360]   It's funny because in SEAL training, one of the parts of the physical fitness test
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:07.040]   are how many pushups can you do in two minutes?
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:12.240]   And most SEALs do about 120 pushups in two minutes on average for these tests.
[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:17.560]   The thing is, I see some people get to 120 and then be like, OK, I'm fine and
[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:18.720]   kind of like mail it in.
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:22.360]   But I also see people get to 100 and struggle super hard.
[00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:27.200]   What I will tell you is that I learn more about the person in the way that they do
[00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:30.120]   their last pushup than you'd ever imagine.
[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:34.720]   You know, whether your last pushup is your 80th or your 100th or your 120th or
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:39.480]   your first or your fifth, for that matter, think about the struggle when you can't
[00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:40.480]   do any more.
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:43.800]   Whatever that is, push harder.
[00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:47.920]   I often say like, you know, SEALs, when we give us a backpack, we'll fill it and
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:49.880]   then take 10 percent more than it's supposed to take.
[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:53.520]   Fill your life up with 5 percent more weight than you can carry.
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:57.240]   So whether it's a plank and doing more minutes, meditate for 10 minutes.
[00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:59.800]   I find myself thinking 17 things at once.
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:02.880]   I've got my Headspace app like we all do or Calm.
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:08.640]   And for me to try to create the solace and the focus is super hard, super hard.
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:10.240]   That's my equivalent.
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:12.840]   How do you plank or you meditate or your thing?
[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:15.240]   Pick something and do it beyond exhaustion.
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:18.200]   I like that. I have a Peloton bike and it's funny.
[00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:22.880]   I had this DIY version of it, which was like build your own bike, get an iPad,
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:24.120]   mount it, put some sensors.
[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:25.400]   And then I got the real one.
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:28.520]   And the difference between the real one and not was very subtle.
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:33.640]   And it was just tracking how much you were doing on the bike in the app.
[00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:38.280]   And that subtle difference was what made me go and say, I can do a little bit more
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:41.920]   the next time. And I can't tell you the number of times that because of that
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:46.120]   one difference in feature that unfortunately costs like $1,000.
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:50.600]   I get to the end and I'm like, oh, I'm within spitting distance of what I did last time.
[00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:53.840]   And this is probably oversharing.
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:57.320]   But and then I get to the point that I'm like almost going to throw up to try to beat
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:01.000]   my last record, which I'm sure a health expert out there will say that's maybe not the
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.640]   best thing. But I like being in that discomfort.
[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:08.840]   And that's the only thing in my life that really makes it forceful to do is trying to
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:11.040]   beat a record in some sort of physical activity.
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:13.080]   Chris, I love what you're saying.
[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:15.320]   And let me bring this to life in a different way.
[00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:19.120]   In SEAL training, you heard me a couple of minutes ago, if I haven't lost you already in
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:21.600]   this, 120 people start, 19 finish.
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:26.720]   What we do in training is we stretch young trainees beyond what they perceive as their
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:29.560]   limit. And then we let them get comfortable again.
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:34.520]   And then the next day or the next hour, we stretch them even further and then we get
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:37.760]   them comfortable again. And we keep doing that over and over and over.
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:42.520]   And it sounds like an exercise in stretching your limits, in learning that the human can
[00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:47.720]   do more and more and more. That is true, but it's also not the biggest lesson from that.
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:51.760]   The biggest lesson from that is when you're repetitively stretched beyond what you
[00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:56.480]   perceive as your limits, what you realize is that they actually are not your limits.
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:01.640]   And so a common trait that SEALs have is this high confidence that I described before,
[00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:06.640]   which is every single SEAL has been in many situations where they think it's going to
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:09.040]   be beyond a limit and you realize it's not.
[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:14.800]   And then what you do is you unlock the brain in a way that lets you realize there is no
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:18.280]   such thing as a limit in life unless you place that limit on yourself.
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:22.440]   So we go into situations actually literally unbound in our thinking.
[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:28.360]   So I am quite comfortable right now, which is actually true almost every day.
[00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:29.680]   And that's thanks to Viore.
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:32.320]   And I'm excited to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:35.600]   They make performance apparel that's incredibly versatile.
[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:39.960]   Everything is designed to work out in, but it doesn't look or feel like it at all.
[00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:41.680]   And it's so freaking comfortable.
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:43.520]   You will want to wear it all the time.
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:47.120]   Seriously, I am pretty sure it's more comfortable than whatever you're wearing right
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:50.560]   now, unless you're wearing Viore, in which case you already know what I mean.
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:52.360]   And it's not just for men.
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:55.120]   My wife is as obsessed with Viore as I am.
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:57.800]   My favorite is the Sunday Performance Joggers.
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:02.040]   I think I have three pairs and they are probably the most comfortable pants I've ever
[00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:06.360]   owned. Their products can be used for just about any activity, whether it's running,
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:07.600]   training or yoga.
[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:12.040]   They're also great for lounging, running around town, or their Metapants can even work
[00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:16.240]   for a night out. Honestly, I think Viore is an investment in your happiness.
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:20.440]   And for all the Hacks listeners, they are offering 20 percent off your first purchase,
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:23.400]   as well as free shipping and returns on U.S.
[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:25.080]   orders over seventy five dollars.
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:31.800]   So you should definitely check them out at allthehacks.com/viore or in the link in the
[00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:40.240]   show notes. Again, go to allthehacks.com/viore and get yourself some of the most
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.960]   comfortable and versatile clothing on the planet.
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:47.760]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:50.280]   I get it. Life comes at you fast.
[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:54.040]   But trust me, your friends are probably desperate for a good hang.
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:58.120]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:03.480]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor Drizzly, the go-to app for
[00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:05.520]   drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:08.600]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:10.440]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:14.960]   It could be your dog's birthday, that the sun finally came out, or maybe you just want
[00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:17.320]   to celebrate that you got through another week.
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:22.000]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.440]   which means you can entice your friends to leave their houses without ever leaving
[00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:30.880]   yours. And since I know you like a good deal, Drizzly compares prices on their massive
[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:34.080]   selection of beer, wine and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:37.760]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting family last
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:42.440]   week, not only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less than an hour, but I found
[00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:45.120]   it for fifteen dollars less than my local liquor store.
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:50.080]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app or go to Drizzly.com.
[00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:54.000]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.360]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:03.080]   Is there maybe an activity or an exercise you put SEALs through in that training that
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:06.360]   someone could do at home or test out and try to build that themselves?
[00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:08.360]   It's the push-ups, sit-ups.
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:11.760]   It's what we described before, just pushing yourself beyond the limit.
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:13.520]   Sure, there's a lot of crazy things in SEAL training.
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:15.800]   You get pushed in the deep end of the pool, 14 feet deep.
[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:19.280]   You have your ankles and your wrists tied, your wrists are behind the back and you've
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:20.600]   got to survive for an hour.
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:22.320]   There's a lot of stuff that don't try at home.
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:26.400]   But honestly, Chris, the great majority of SEAL training is no secret.
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:33.440]   It is like just as simple as a human and his or her body weight to take yourself beyond
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:37.240]   that limit. If you can't manufacture that on your own, then just get your favorite
[00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:39.400]   fitness app and whatever it says to do, do it.
[00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:42.640]   Don't hurt yourself, but take it to that point that you're describing.
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:47.840]   I like it. I think a lot of people in the workplace, and I've put myself in this
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:51.960]   situation many times, get in trouble for kind of not following the rules.
[00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:56.920]   But you talk a little bit about how to use your instincts and how to think about rules
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:02.040]   and making a practical sense of that hard choice where there's rules and you think
[00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:04.000]   there might be consequences, but you know what's right.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.080]   How do you make those decisions and hone those instincts and feel free to give an
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:09.560]   example of it as well?
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:14.280]   Absolutely. So look, if the whole world were just rule followers, we'd never advance
[00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:19.000]   anything. You know, we would just all go follow the rules and we wouldn't have the
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.160]   innovation and the entrepreneurship that the world needs.
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:28.680]   That said, as a society, we are more productive when we together do harmonize and
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:33.760]   live with laws and customs that help us build each other up and help us respect the
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:37.640]   fact that we're all different. And so that's a balance that has to happen in the
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:39.600]   world. First of all, what's the intention?
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:41.600]   Is the intention good?
[00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:46.440]   And then what's the likely cost or harm of the action, the rule that you're going to
[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:51.080]   break? And then you just think it's really not more complicated than a simple cost
[00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:52.160]   benefit analysis.
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:55.320]   Do the overall benefits outweigh the costs?
[00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:57.280]   If they do, go do the thing.
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:01.120]   Don't cross any red lines of morals and ethics in the law.
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:05.600]   As long as you're on the right side of morals and ethics in the law, go push, go
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:08.360]   push. Don't be afraid to push, make great things happen.
[00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:11.880]   It takes energy and momentum in new directions to try new things.
[00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:16.160]   How many of us in 2000 thought we'd need to walk around with one of these smartphones
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:20.640]   either, you know, pegged to our ear or being stared at 20 hours a day in our hands?
[00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:25.360]   We couldn't imagine a world with an ecosystem of the application development that we
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:26.680]   hold in the power of our hands.
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:29.800]   Now, what's that going to be in the next five years, 10 years, 20 years?
[00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:33.880]   We don't know right now, but the only way we're going to figure that out is by people
[00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:37.920]   continuing to have vision and then go after the things that pursue the dreams and the
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:39.400]   visions that they have.
[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:43.840]   It takes a combination of smart rule breaking is the way I would phrase it.
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:50.960]   As a manager, I am really frustrated when people just completely ignore what, you
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:52.120]   know, you ask them to do.
[00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:55.880]   But I'm actually not frustrated when they come back and say, "Hey, actually, I heard
[00:30:55.880 --> 00:31:00.560]   what you said, but this insight led me to think that this might be a better path."
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:05.160]   Maybe it's good to flag that as early as is possible, but I do think that what you
[00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:09.400]   said, I've seen play out in the workplace well, but it's when you don't have that
[00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:13.960]   intention behind your deviation from the task that I think things really fall apart.
[00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:16.160]   Totally agree with you.
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:19.320]   I've never met somebody who wakes up and says, "I'm going to go screw something up at
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:23.880]   work today." You know, it's really ultimately about that drive and that determination to
[00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:25.640]   go make positive change.
[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:27.440]   So I net out the same as you do.
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:32.120]   That's great. You've said that asking for help is actually a sign of strength, not
[00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:36.880]   weakness. I think that's, you know, a big shift in the military in recent years.
[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:40.960]   I know maybe 20, 30 years ago, that wouldn't have been the way people think about it.
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:43.360]   You think that's a good shift?
[00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:46.400]   How did that come about and how can we use that in our own lives?
[00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:48.840]   Yeah, look, it's a necessary shift.
[00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:51.760]   I, like every SEAL of my era, have buried way too many friends.
[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:55.600]   I've got about 70 friends killed in action or perished during the last decades of
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:57.600]   conflict. And ultimately, that's why I wrote my book.
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:02.440]   I forgot to mention in the beginning that I donate every penny from Never Enough to a
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:05.800]   501(c)(3) I started that pays off mortgages for Gold Star families.
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:09.680]   And I think the most important thing to recognize is that when you're doing things for
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:13.400]   others and you're connecting back to that mission and the meaning and the purpose, then
[00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:15.720]   it makes it very, very much easier.
[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:18.000]   But you have to start with the outcome based thinking.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.920]   At the end of a six month deployment overseas, you get somebody who says, "Hey, I
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:27.160]   wrote 3,000 intelligence reports." And I'm like, "That's an output." What did those
[00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:28.640]   intelligence reports do?
[00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:30.200]   What did they lead to?
[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:36.200]   Or you get your logistics teams that say, "Hey, we spent 1.1 million dollars on this
[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:40.520]   thing." And like, "OK, great, but what did we get for that 1.1 million dollars?" The
[00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:44.120]   number of missions that you go on are irrelevant.
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:47.120]   What's relevant is the outcomes from those missions.
[00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:50.320]   And so, Chris, I think that what we need to think about in life, and this is what I
[00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:54.800]   think about in business, is we have a certain amount of investment dollars that we can
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.720]   make choices with on how we spend them within our firm.
[00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:00.400]   Where do we invest and where do we work to take the business?
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:02.240]   Do we invest in new capability?
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:04.200]   Do we try to open new markets?
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:05.680]   What do we do? How do we think about that?
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:10.280]   You have to think about what's the outcome that you're after and then what's the
[00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:13.280]   efficiency, the most efficient way to go achieve the outcome.
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:19.160]   So you have to look at like a return on invested capital or an IRR, internal rate of
[00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:24.080]   return. Not to sound too mathy, but if I have a dollar and I can turn it into a dollar
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:28.480]   ten doing one thing and a dollar eleven doing another thing, go do the thing that's
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:29.680]   going to make you a dollar eleven.
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:32.160]   Think about the path of least resistance there.
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:35.680]   I want the person that didn't write 3,000 intelligence reports.
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:41.320]   I want the person that wrote one and that one intelligence report led to the biggest
[00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:42.840]   success ever. I joke around.
[00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:44.760]   The L in SEAL stands for lazy.
[00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:51.040]   We find the easiest path to the goal because then after that, we have more time, more
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:55.360]   effort and energy so we can go either do more missions or rest more for the next
[00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:56.880]   mission and whatever's around the corner.
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:00.880]   But in all cases, we're always better off being as efficient as we humanly can.
[00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:05.680]   And that's why bringing it back to the business world, when we're in a meeting, the
[00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:08.560]   first thing that I do is say, what do we want out of this meeting?
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:12.320]   We're only doing one of a couple of elemental verbs in a meeting.
[00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:17.360]   We're either deciding something, we're teaching about something, we're informing and
[00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:21.640]   giving people information, or we're brainstorming a problem and trying to think about
[00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:23.880]   creatively come up with a set of solutions.
[00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:28.200]   Maybe there's another verb or two, but those four verbs are basically the reason to
[00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:32.480]   have a meeting. If you are not doing that, then what are you doing and why?
[00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:37.360]   If we're just hearing people talk to hear people talk, we are wasting the company's
[00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:41.680]   resources because we can be letting people go do work on different things.
[00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:46.840]   So at the end of the meeting, the acid test for me, Chris, is to ask who is going to go
[00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:48.880]   do what differently after the meeting?
[00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:52.640]   If we leave a meeting and nobody can answer that question, we didn't just need to have
[00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:55.800]   that meeting. It's funny, I look back at all the episodes I've done.
[00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:57.600]   I have a lot of personal beliefs about meetings.
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:01.720]   And David Marquet is another former submarine commander who wrote a book.
[00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:02.920]   We talked about meetings.
[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:07.280]   And now I think my answer is if you're running a meeting in your company, the best
[00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:10.080]   thing you can do is find anyone that's been in the military and have them run the
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:15.160]   meeting, because I feel like the best meeting advice I've gotten is from people in the
[00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:17.160]   military. So I think that's great advice.
[00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:19.360]   We really waste a lot of times with meetings.
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:24.120]   Can I say make one more point on this, which is a culture point, Chris, which is if we're
[00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:27.680]   running a meeting, say you and I are in a meeting with 10 other people and somebody
[00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:33.320]   starts talking and creating an avenue in the meeting that is not productive to the main
[00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:34.600]   goal of the meeting, what do you do?
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:38.080]   Do you cut the person off or do you let them keep going?
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:41.720]   The polite thing, the easy thing is let them keep going and be like, OK, they'll be done
[00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:43.960]   in four minutes. It'll be done in six minutes.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.320]   Six minutes is 10 percent of a 60 minute meeting.
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:49.640]   Like, do you want to lose 10 percent of a meeting letting somebody ramble?
[00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:54.960]   No. Like you want to cut that person off politely, of course, but that takes a certain
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:57.160]   culture where that's OK.
[00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:59.920]   Do you have an example of how you would cut someone off politely in a meeting?
[00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:01.760]   I think anyone listening might have that question.
[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:06.960]   Well, yeah, when somebody gets the real answer, let me know.
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:10.560]   I've been trying to politely cut people off for years and often people, there's no way
[00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:13.880]   around it. People are going to feel slightly overcorrected when you do that.
[00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:15.640]   Just tackle everything head on.
[00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:20.480]   You talked a minute ago about, in essence, passive aggressive versus direct.
[00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:22.720]   There's no room for passive aggressivity.
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:26.000]   Just say what you're thinking, but do it in a respectful way.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.200]   I talked in Washington, D.C., when we were doing the START treaty.
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:33.480]   You get all these people who, after the meeting, start wanting to grab another person
[00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:35.240]   and do the whisper campaign.
[00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:36.560]   And, oh, what about this? What about that?
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:40.920]   No, if we have something to say, let's do it at the table and out in the open because
[00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:42.320]   it's just way more efficient.
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:43.600]   It's way more productive.
[00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:45.160]   I think it takes a little bit of practice.
[00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:46.600]   It's making people feel safe.
[00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:50.520]   It's making people feel like if we do cut them off, they know it's because we're trying
[00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:53.200]   to be the best group that we can be and have the best meeting we can.
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:57.520]   My mom's a psychologist, social worker, and used the famous sandwich technique.
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:59.720]   Compliment, cut off, and then compliment.
[00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:03.200]   The best answer I have is from Andy Ratcliffe, who I've had on the podcast.
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:07.720]   He's run the company I work at now because I got into a lot of these situations myself
[00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:10.560]   and people would say, "Ah, Chris is like trying to derail this thing.
[00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:11.440]   It's kind of frustrating."
[00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:15.480]   And his advice to me was, "You need to make sure you state your intentions more."
[00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:19.760]   So instead of interrupting someone and saying, "Hey, you're going on a little long.
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:21.280]   We got a purpose here.
[00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:22.000]   Let's move on."
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.200]   You say, "Hey, I just want to interrupt quick.
[00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:28.080]   I really want to make sure that this meeting can be the most productive use of
[00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:28.840]   everyone's time.
[00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:30.640]   We came here for this reason.
[00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:32.600]   And so maybe we should get back on topic."
[00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:37.200]   For me, it's shown up a lot where I say, "Look, I really want to see us go big.
[00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:40.320]   So when I criticize this thing, it's not because I think it's bad.
[00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:41.440]   It's because I think we can do better."
[00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:45.600]   So I didn't do that for a lot of time in my role in a few jobs.
[00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:50.440]   And it caused a lot of friction with people because they thought, "Oh, he just
[00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:51.000]   doesn't care.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.560]   He's just on his own mission.
[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:53.560]   He has his own accord."
[00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:57.520]   And the reality was I needed to make sure people knew that I'm only here to build the
[00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:58.760]   best thing we can at this company.
[00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:00.080]   That's all I care about.
[00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:05.640]   And stating that puts everything else you say in context and saves a lot of back
[00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:07.240]   channel criticism of you.
[00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:08.920]   Love that.
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:10.640]   Presume positive intent is what you're saying.
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:11.640]   Super quick story.
[00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:14.920]   One of my classmates from grad school is now a leadership professor at Harvard
[00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:15.520]   Business School.
[00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:20.760]   I go back and guest in his class every year, have for the last six or seven years
[00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:22.360]   for there's a specific case that I help with.
[00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:23.680]   And it's a ton of fun.
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:27.240]   I see one of my best friends on the planet be an incredible professor and see him in
[00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:27.640]   action.
[00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:28.640]   And it's just really special.
[00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:32.000]   But there was one year where this grad school student was sitting in the back of
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.720]   the room and asked the proverbial three minute wind up of a question.
[00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:37.000]   You all know the type.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.760]   It's the, I want to tell you how smart I am, but really kind of pretend it's a
[00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:41.320]   question.
[00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:46.760]   And, and so the tail end of it was some thinly veiled question.
[00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:49.480]   And I said, you know, rather than me answering that, let me take this a
[00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:50.200]   different direction.
[00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:54.760]   I said, honestly, I experienced you as a very bad question asker.
[00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:59.760]   And so let me tell you why it wasn't succinct enough.
[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:01.760]   It wasn't, you know, X, Y, Z gave constructive feedback.
[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:04.400]   And I said, look, right now you're probably not feeling great.
[00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:07.600]   You're probably shrinking in your chair a little bit, or you're frustrated with me
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:10.000]   or some combination of negative emotions.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:15.200]   But let me ask you this, would you rather me share this feedback with you?
[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:18.360]   And then have you ask yourself like, Hey, maybe there's some something in there
[00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:21.840]   where I can learn and grow from, or would you rather have me not say what I just
[00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:25.120]   said and let you keep going through life as a terrible question asker?
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:28.080]   Theoretically, it's really easy to understand.
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:29.600]   No, I want to be a great question asker.
[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:30.200]   Okay, great.
[00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:31.280]   But how do you feel right now?
[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:34.040]   And so you have to get over that negative feeling when somebody is
[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:36.080]   trying to help build you up.
[00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:39.320]   Now you could argue that it's maybe publicly in 110 person classroom or
[00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:40.560]   whatever is not the place to do that.
[00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:43.240]   But I was making a point for a reason.
[00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:47.280]   I was trying to make a metaphorical point to 110 students in the classroom is go
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:51.040]   through life, presuming positive intent from others, but when something goes
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:56.600]   sideways, like no matter if you're one or 99% wrong or 100% wrong, start with
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:58.560]   yourself and say, what could I have done better?
[00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:01.320]   And then you won't miss that opportunity for growth and the principle of
[00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:03.800]   excellence, which we talked about at the beginning.
[00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:04.800]   Yeah.
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:07.720]   I mean, you could have followed up with said, and I could have said this to you
[00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:08.240]   privately.
[00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:11.440]   You could have learned well, but aren't you glad that 109 other people get to
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:12.400]   also learn that lesson?
[00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:14.120]   Oh, dude, I wish I would have thought of that in the moment.
[00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:16.280]   This is a great opportunity to use your own feedback.
[00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:18.520]   Earlier, I asked a question about asking for help.
[00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:20.000]   We took a little bit of a detour.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:24.600]   So you got to work a little bit, Mike, on your skills, listening to the question
[00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:29.760]   being asked, but I was trying to get at whether asking for help is a sign of
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:30.840]   strength or weakness.
[00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:33.240]   It seems like something that shifted in the military.
[00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:37.360]   Can you talk about your perspective and, and why asking for help might be
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:38.520]   something we should do more of?
[00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:39.080]   Yeah.
[00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:41.920]   First of all, your, your feedback is spot on.
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:43.040]   You're absolutely correct.
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:45.440]   And I already was like, gosh, how did I miss answering that?
[00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:47.080]   You totally asked it and I didn't answer it.
[00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:50.240]   My brain was in a million different spots and I simply wasn't good enough to
[00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:52.520]   remember what you said and to answer your question directly.
[00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:54.040]   So that's my response.
[00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:58.280]   Now, hopefully in there, people can hear the modeling for like the giving and
[00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:00.280]   receiving and feedback back and forth.
[00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:04.440]   There's a meta point in there, but to answer directly now, it is a very serious
[00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:04.920]   topic.
[00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:09.720]   I grew up in the SEALs in an era where you only showed strength or perceived
[00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:10.280]   strength.
[00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:13.240]   You did not show weakness and that is not healthy.
[00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:18.800]   After the stress of decades plus of combat to buried about 70 different
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:23.560]   friends over time and everybody who's served knows somebody who has paid the
[00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:24.720]   ultimate sacrifice.
[00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:30.600]   So the question right now is when somebody needs something, how do you make
[00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:34.520]   them feel when they ask, do you make them feel taller or smaller?
[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:37.000]   We have to build up people who ask for help.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.560]   If you just look at the number of people now who have died by suicide, it has
[00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:45.240]   risen astronomically on Thursday, a couple of days ago before recording five
[00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:49.360]   days before right now, I had a really good friend who I looked up to who was a
[00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:54.960]   BUD/S instructor, a SEAL instructor of mine who was an incredible human being.
[00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:56.680]   I deployed with him to Iraq.
[00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:58.840]   We did a bunch of missions together.
[00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:01.200]   He took his own life and it really hit me hard.
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:02.320]   I don't know the details.
[00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:06.320]   He's a friend who I haven't talked to in a couple of years and unfortunately
[00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:10.280]   stories like this are way too common and I beat myself up over the weekend and
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:12.080]   saying, gosh, I haven't reached out to him lately.
[00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:13.160]   Did I come up short?
[00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:14.960]   You know, and I had a tough weekend.
[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:15.560]   I'll just say that.
[00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:19.480]   I think, why was my friend not able to ask for help?
[00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:20.960]   I don't know the answer to that question.
[00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:21.720]   I really don't.
[00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:27.480]   But I also will say the flip side of this is that to let asking the hard
[00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:31.880]   questions be okay, I'm going to ask the hard intrusive questions from now on.
[00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:35.720]   I've said this because I've learned from people that I haven't helped well
[00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:41.000]   enough and now I go through life pretty comfortable saying, hey, have you ever
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:45.840]   considered harm to self or how are you really doing and most Americans or
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:47.160]   people when they say, how are you doing?
[00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:48.240]   We don't really want the answer.
[00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:50.280]   That's just a little quick little, hey, how's it going?
[00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:50.880]   How are you doing?
[00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:51.440]   Okay, great.
[00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:51.880]   You're good.
[00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:52.560]   Okay, good.
[00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:53.240]   No, no, no.
[00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:57.400]   Like when, when we're really intrusive in people's lives, we are actually
[00:42:57.400 --> 00:43:02.040]   listening to what we can do to make sure that their life is as good as it can be.
[00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:07.120]   And so we have to be, celebrate being intrusive in people's lives as positive.
[00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:13.240]   So asking for help on one side is a positive thing and being intrusive in
[00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:17.040]   people's lives is positive 99 times out of a hundred when I say to a friend of
[00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:18.800]   mine, have you ever considered harm to self?
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:20.080]   It can be awkward.
[00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:23.600]   It's like, no, man, what are you asking me that for a defensive or whatever.
[00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:28.160]   But for the one time out of a hundred, when the person says, yes, I'll take the
[00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:33.120]   99 awkwards for the one yes, because that is a way to make sure that you get
[00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:34.320]   people the help that they need.
[00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:36.120]   It has to be okay to ask for help.
[00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:39.960]   I'm droning on and trying to, because I'm emphasizing the fact that the culture
[00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:44.560]   really had to change and it has changed, but it's still not where it needs to be,
[00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:48.040]   not just in the seals, but in the military writ large and in society writ large.
[00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:49.800]   Life is hard in this pandemic.
[00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:53.040]   How do we make sure that people are as strong as they can?
[00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:59.120]   One more thing I'll say on this is that a trick I've learned in this is to not
[00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:02.720]   think about absolutes, think about relative in a team.
[00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:04.800]   And I, when I say team, a team is family.
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:05.400]   It's your neighbors.
[00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:05.960]   It's your friends.
[00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:06.680]   It's your colleagues.
[00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:08.680]   It's people in your civic organizations.
[00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:13.320]   In a team, there are people who are always relatively up and relatively down.
[00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:17.640]   So the people who are relatively up have to help the people who are relatively
[00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:20.800]   down because tomorrow the roles will be reversed.
[00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:24.200]   And so if the people who are always relatively up are helping the people
[00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:29.160]   who are relatively down, that's how you make a team as strong as you humanly can.
[00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:32.440]   Well, first off, I'm really sorry for your loss.
[00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:36.280]   And I appreciate you being open and sharing like that on the show.
[00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:40.840]   What's a way to ask those questions at work to find out where people are
[00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:43.080]   down and try to help build them up?
[00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:47.480]   Are there questions you ask or things you bring to a meeting to try to bring
[00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:49.280]   people together towards that medium?
[00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:51.680]   If you're having a day where you're on the top.
[00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:53.680]   It's creating comfort.
[00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:54.520]   You're absolutely.
[00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:57.480]   And so this is a situation where it's not in the 110 person
[00:44:57.480 --> 00:44:58.680]   classroom or conference room.
[00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:01.320]   This is truly a one-on-one conversation.
[00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:04.320]   And so look, I'm in an organization of 40,000 people.
[00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:08.160]   Now I run global operations for VMware, a massively awesome
[00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:09.800]   software company based in Palo Alto.
[00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:12.480]   And look, I can't help 40,000 people.
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:13.160]   Right.
[00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:16.240]   And so how do I help as many people as I can?
[00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:17.320]   Well, it's simple.
[00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:21.520]   How do I take my seven or eight direct reports and do that with those seven
[00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:24.880]   and eight people, and then help make sure that they're doing it with their seven
[00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:28.320]   or eight direct reports, and then that it cascades through an organization.
[00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:32.920]   So leadership has to model the behaviors that we want.
[00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:34.480]   Now it doesn't have to be prescriptive.
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:36.160]   You don't always have to do everything my way.
[00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:39.600]   That'll be unhealthy for an organization, but go achieve that goal.
[00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:43.680]   However, it makes the most sense, but really understand what is
[00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:48.000]   making someone either motivated or demotivated and help them have more
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:49.200]   of the good and less of the bad.
[00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:55.040]   One tactic I know you mentioned in the book was going to meet just one-on-one
[00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:58.080]   people, trying to have a conversation with people you don't know at work.
[00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:01.520]   Can you talk a little bit about why you started doing that and what it's brought
[00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:03.280]   to organizations you've been a part of?
[00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:07.400]   Yes, specifically when I was in the White House, both
[00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:08.640]   administrations, Bush and Obama.
[00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:11.080]   People work super hard in the White House.
[00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:14.040]   We can always make fun of whatever party's in or out of favor.
[00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:17.400]   There's a lot of really great public servants who are working long, long days
[00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:19.560]   to try to make this great nation greater.
[00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:22.280]   What I have found is that it's hard to slow down when you're
[00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:24.040]   in those very visible roles.
[00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:28.880]   And I made a point to just go get a lunch with somebody three times a week.
[00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:32.040]   And it's a costly hour in the middle of the day.
[00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:35.720]   And inevitably, Chris, when I had to peel myself away from my desk and I have a
[00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:39.640]   million things that are needing to be done, I'd be scratching my head saying,
[00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:41.040]   gosh, why did I just do this?
[00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:44.600]   Honestly, 15 minutes into that lunch, I was not thinking about
[00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:45.760]   all the things I needed to do.
[00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:47.480]   I was locked in with somebody else.
[00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:51.600]   And usually from either another part of the White House or an organization that
[00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:55.280]   had something to do loosely with whatever professional goals that I
[00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:56.480]   and we were trying to achieve.
[00:46:57.200 --> 00:47:00.000]   And what you realize is at the end of the day, when you go home at 10 o'clock,
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.320]   you're not remembering that hour that you didn't spend at your
[00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:04.600]   desk in the middle of the day.
[00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:08.760]   But what you do remember is the relationship and the person and what you
[00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:10.600]   learned from the hour in that lunch.
[00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:16.880]   And then not ironically, over time, you develop an ecosystem of people that you
[00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:19.160]   can call on and help make great things happen.
[00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:22.600]   A lot of times people ask me how to think about networking.
[00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:28.720]   My advice is that a network is not a group of people who you get something from.
[00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:31.840]   A network is a group of people who you give something to.
[00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:36.760]   Then in the few times in life when we really do critically need help, that
[00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:40.840]   group of people that we've invested in, not surprisingly, is the group where we
[00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:43.320]   get energy back from and we get help back from.
[00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:45.640]   So a network is a group of people we invest in.
[00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:49.040]   By investing in other people and understanding what is this colleague in
[00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:52.720]   the other wing of the White House or the other part of my company organization
[00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:56.880]   structure trying to achieve, well, I might be able to connect dots that that
[00:47:56.880 --> 00:48:00.000]   person may not be able to connect him or herself.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:03.560]   And so if I can create value for somebody else in very easy ways by
[00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:08.320]   connecting dots, then you're making your organization and then frankly, the
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:10.520]   nation, if you extract it out, a lot stronger.
[00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:12.600]   I love that lesson.
[00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:14.640]   I've used it a lot in a virtual world.
[00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:19.600]   I think it's been harder, but one tactic I'll share is that it can be so hard
[00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:22.680]   when you're on your computer working and then you have a meeting and you
[00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:25.240]   mentioned, "Gosh, in the moment, I just have all this stuff to do.
[00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:26.120]   I have to step away."
[00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:29.920]   Well, when you're doing a video call, sometimes it's really hard to step away.
[00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:30.080]   Right?
[00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:31.520]   You've got your other tab open.
[00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:36.800]   So what I try to do myself is I try to force myself to put the meeting in full
[00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:40.000]   screen and slide back from my desk a little bit.
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   So the keyboard's not quite in reach and I'm not distracted.
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:44.720]   And I try to treat it more like that.
[00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:45.960]   It's difficult.
[00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:49.520]   I've actually started pushing away the virtual meeting and just saying, "Can
[00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:50.880]   we just do a phone call and go on a walk?"
[00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:55.120]   Because when I'm walking, I'm not distracted by work and I'm more engaged
[00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:59.240]   in the conversation and it seems counterintuitive to me to think, "Wow,
[00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:01.440]   if I don't see you, I might be more engaged."
[00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:04.760]   But when I see you, I see the alert popping up on my email.
[00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:07.080]   I see the chat popping up on Slack or something.
[00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:10.000]   I've been struggling with the lack of in-person meetings.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:13.840]   And I do genuinely believe those in-person meetings can be more valuable
[00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:15.160]   than their virtual counterparts.
[00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:17.680]   But I think there are a few tactics you can use to try to make those
[00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:18.800]   virtual conversations better.
[00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:20.440]   Oh, man, I still agree.
[00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:22.560]   And I'm not good enough at it myself.
[00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:23.800]   I get distracted too easily.
[00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:27.200]   There were two tricks that somebody told me and I did a little bit of live TV.
[00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:29.600]   You know, I was on a bunch of different channels when my book first
[00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:30.600]   came out about a year ago.
[00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:36.040]   And I just took a little yellow sticky and I drew an arrow to right where I
[00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:39.000]   needed to look for the, where the pinhole is on your camera, whatever
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:42.560]   camera you use, your eye then goes like right into the camera.
[00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:45.520]   That way you're not checking your stock prices or Instagram or
[00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:47.160]   whatever the case may be.
[00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:50.080]   And then Chris, I've never said this to anybody, but I've got this
[00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:52.320]   little sticky that says, "Be present in the meeting."
[00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:54.120]   And I stick this right on my desk here.
[00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:57.080]   So as I sometimes start to reach for something else, I'm like, "No,
[00:49:57.080 --> 00:49:58.520]   wait a minute, lock in, lock in."
[00:49:58.520 --> 00:50:01.880]   Because we're recording a conversation where I feel like
[00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:03.320]   presence is the most important thing.
[00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:06.040]   If I were writing my email, this would be a terrible interview, I assume.
[00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:08.560]   I actually invested and it wasn't that expensive.
[00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:13.360]   It was maybe a hundred dollars in a teleprompter and I have
[00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:14.760]   an iPad that sits under it.
[00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:18.560]   So I joined this meeting from an iPad that projects your face onto a mirrored
[00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:20.040]   screen with a camera behind it.
[00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:23.440]   So I'm not actually looking at my computer right now.
[00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:27.720]   I'm looking at a piece of glass in front of a camera and it's allowed
[00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:31.720]   me to really be looking at you, having a conversation, feel like it's
[00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:34.560]   working, not feel like the, "Okay, do I look at the camera?
[00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:35.680]   Do I look at Mike's face?"
[00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:36.720]   It got stressful.
[00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:40.040]   So that $100 purchase has made the presence I have in these
[00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:41.400]   conversations a lot better.
[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:46.080]   And it might seem like overkill, but if delivering meetings is part of
[00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:49.960]   your job, things like that, things like even just buying a decent microphone.
[00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:52.880]   I noticed a side effect of this podcast was when I went to work
[00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:55.000]   meetings with the podcast microphone.
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.960]   People are like, "Wow, you sound so crisp."
[00:50:56.960 --> 00:51:00.320]   Two people in my core team went and bought a microphone after that
[00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:02.880]   because they were like, "Look, I want to sound present.
[00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:03.880]   I want to be there.
[00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:05.400]   I don't want to sound like I'm distracted.
[00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:07.240]   Dishes clinking in the background or whatever."
[00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:10.040]   So there are a few tactics you can use there as well.
[00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:11.880]   So hopefully this is all helpful.
[00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:15.160]   I hope we get more opportunities to spend time in person.
[00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:17.720]   And I already, at my company, see them happening right now.
[00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:18.960]   Absolutely.
[00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:20.240]   Well, Chris, I take the opposite.
[00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:23.080]   I'm a lot smarter when I'm on mute and I look better when the video is off.
[00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:28.120]   You've been in a lot of situations and you talk about them in your book
[00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:30.840]   where you're at life or death, shoot or don't shoot.
[00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:35.800]   And I want to come back to that before we wrap and just talk about how some
[00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:39.200]   of those really high stakes decisions you've been in, where you had to make
[00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:42.520]   a decision in a moment, can be a lesson for people listening.
[00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:43.680]   100%.
[00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:48.200]   The most important thing in these situations, again, is figuring
[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:49.600]   out what do you want out of it?
[00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:52.760]   Another spoiler alert, but there's enough good stuff in the book
[00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:56.480]   where nothing I've said should dissuade you from picking up Never Enough.
[00:51:56.760 --> 00:52:00.120]   The way I open Never Enough is actually a situation in
[00:52:00.120 --> 00:52:01.920]   2007 on the streets of Iraq.
[00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:07.480]   There was a sealed platoon that was clearing houses and the job is very simple.
[00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:10.600]   How do you stop bad people from doing bad things to good people?
[00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:14.200]   Well, this particular night, myself and a teammate of mine named Josh were
[00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:18.600]   actually holding security outside the building and a man at two in the morning
[00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:22.880]   stepped out of his house on the other side of the street and he very quickly
[00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:27.600]   started to reach into his garb and it looked like he was potentially pulling a
[00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:28.240]   weapon out.
[00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:32.440]   Now, Josh and I both instantly aimed at the guy because we're not
[00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:36.080]   going to let him shoot at us, but we were both so highly trained that we
[00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:39.320]   were able to wait for it and pause and let life slow down.
[00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:42.240]   And actually what he did was he pulled out an ID card to show
[00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:44.080]   that he was not a bad person.
[00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:47.920]   And that could have been a deadly decision to reach quickly for an ID card.
[00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:52.920]   But fortunately, Josh and I were trained well enough where we could slow down
[00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:56.680]   and have that confidence where we could wait a couple milliseconds to see what
[00:52:56.680 --> 00:52:58.520]   does this guy actually pull out of his garb.
[00:52:58.520 --> 00:53:02.560]   And thank God we did because, Chris, we don't want to harm anybody that we
[00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:03.480]   don't have to harm.
[00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:04.800]   Like, that's terrible.
[00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:09.080]   The story, seals that didn't kill someone, that's a celebration for us.
[00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:12.560]   You know, so we're trying to make the world a better place and that's the
[00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:13.880]   mission of the community, really.
[00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:15.160]   And how does that happen?
[00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:18.760]   Again, we talked earlier in this conversation about training and about
[00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:20.760]   how do you get the world to slow down.
[00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:26.160]   But in these life and death situations, it really is about remaining extremely
[00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:30.440]   calm, not letting the distracting thoughts get in your head.
[00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:36.280]   Fear or any other negative emotions will only reduce the probability of a great
[00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:40.440]   outcome, the best possible outcome for you and your team or your organizations.
[00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:43.400]   It's a hard thing to do, but you can get better and better at it.
[00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:47.720]   Ideally in training situations where it's safe, but then on game day, when you
[00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:51.000]   really need to perform or in this particular two in the morning in the
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:54.960]   streets of Fallujah in 2007, then you can perform when you have to.
[00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:56.080]   Thanks for sharing.
[00:53:56.080 --> 00:54:00.560]   I just want to thank you quick for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:03.400]   Your support is what keeps this show going.
[00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:08.280]   To get all of the URLs, codes, deals, and discounts from our partners, you
[00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:11.360]   can go to allthehacks.com/deals.
[00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:14.760]   So please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:19.360]   I'm curious how you see the principles from Never Enough changing in a person's
[00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:23.680]   life and do some of them become more or less important at different stages?
[00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:25.280]   It's a great question.
[00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:28.600]   I would say that the most important thing is that principle around
[00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:30.760]   agility is exactly what you're describing.
[00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:35.120]   Everybody's heard the battlefield comment where no plan survives
[00:54:35.120 --> 00:54:36.600]   first contact with the enemy.
[00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:41.160]   I'll tell you in my mind, my plan is already for the plan to change.
[00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:44.800]   When you go into a situation, knowing that it's going to be dynamic,
[00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:46.320]   you're already a step ahead.
[00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:51.800]   So in my real job now at VMware, my job is to not help transform
[00:54:51.800 --> 00:54:53.560]   VMware and our customers.
[00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:57.080]   My job is to transform our ability to transform.
[00:54:57.080 --> 00:55:01.520]   Building that ultra agility into the organization, because none of
[00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:02.960]   us know where markets are going.
[00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:04.920]   Nobody can foresee the future.
[00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:08.920]   We can make smart guesses, but how do we improve our ability to
[00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:11.000]   react quickly and as well as possible?
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:14.880]   So I think that what I've written in Never Enough is an elastic set
[00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:18.800]   of principles that can apply not just today, but set you up for
[00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:19.960]   the unforeseen tomorrow.
[00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:24.440]   Now, I'm very thankful you wrote the book because it's actually the
[00:55:24.440 --> 00:55:28.160]   kind of book where I've both read and referenced and taken some notes in.
[00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:32.120]   But I actually heard you say in an interview that you wanted to not be
[00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:34.720]   Googleable, you didn't want to be found and that writing it was out of
[00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:35.760]   your comfort zone.
[00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:37.600]   And I thank you for making the change.
[00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:40.200]   But what happened and how did you make that kind of large change to
[00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:41.120]   start writing this book?
[00:55:41.120 --> 00:55:43.600]   You're the first person who's asked that question that way.
[00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:48.360]   First of all, what you said is right on just I will emphasize, I tried
[00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:51.120]   to stay off of not Googleable forever.
[00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:53.280]   And it was a different moment for me.
[00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:56.080]   I'm probably like the one of the last comers to social media, if you
[00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:58.560]   will, I got on Instagram because of the book.
[00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:01.880]   And I said to myself, if I'm going to write a book, I want it to be
[00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:02.640]   successful.
[00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:03.920]   And what is success?
[00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:04.880]   It's not about me.
[00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:06.520]   Never enough isn't about my case.
[00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:07.880]   I could care less about that.
[00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:11.720]   What I care about is elevating the conversation for people.
[00:56:11.720 --> 00:56:15.800]   And then literally the profits go to the 501(c)(3) that pay off mortgages
[00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:16.680]   for gold star families.
[00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:21.320]   I've personally, with my foundation, paid off six mortgages for widows and
[00:56:21.320 --> 00:56:24.440]   children whose fathers paid the ultimate sacrifice.
[00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:26.360]   And for me, that's what it's about.
[00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:27.560]   I can't sit still, Chris.
[00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:29.440]   I'm never able to rest.
[00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:32.920]   And so for me, that mission to go continue to do great things for
[00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:37.960]   others is predicated on frankly, even doing this podcast, I love talking
[00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:40.800]   to you, but in the spirit of what we said earlier, asking for help is a
[00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:41.520]   sign of strength.
[00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:44.760]   It isn't easy for me to go out there and say, Hey, well, everybody listening,
[00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:48.280]   please jump on Amazon or wherever you get buy books, go buy Never Enough.
[00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:50.560]   It's all of about 15 bucks or it's on Audible.
[00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:54.720]   And I read the book and like asking for that kind of help is really hard for
[00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:57.360]   me, but I've gotten used to it and out of my comfort zone.
[00:56:57.600 --> 00:57:01.120]   The way I personally am able to square the circle there is because
[00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:02.160]   I'm not doing it for me.
[00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:04.840]   I'm doing it to try to make a positive impact for others.
[00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:08.560]   I've been asked for life advice so many different times that I just don't have
[00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:10.080]   the capacity to do it for everybody.
[00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:13.680]   Now I can hand them my best effort at a combination of stories
[00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:14.920]   and advice and insights.
[00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:18.600]   If you're listening, you're actually helping people buying this book.
[00:57:18.600 --> 00:57:19.960]   Mike's not making a profit here.
[00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:21.240]   I thought it was fantastic.
[00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:22.440]   I can highly recommend it.
[00:57:22.440 --> 00:57:25.600]   My wife borrowed it over the holiday a little bit ago and she enjoyed it.
[00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:27.920]   So definitely check out the book.
[00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:31.640]   I have one other random question, which didn't fall into the narrative of the book.
[00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:36.240]   But you talk a lot about how when you're a SEAL, you don't sleep a lot.
[00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:38.400]   Sometimes you might stay up for five days straight.
[00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:41.480]   Are there any tactics that you took away from that
[00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:44.000]   that have been helpful in life after SEALs?
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:47.480]   Well, Chris, I just want to first a little bit challenge
[00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:48.880]   the premise of what you said.
[00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:53.800]   Being able to operate on a little bit of sleep is essential, but it's also dumb.
[00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:59.920]   And so what we always try to do is be as rested and as strong as we possibly can.
[00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:04.360]   We only build that skill or the ability to do that because we have to at times.
[00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:07.760]   And as a leader in the SEALs, what you're constantly thinking about
[00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:10.880]   is just very simple physical performance.
[00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:14.200]   It's scientifically proven, like as we diminish in our sleep,
[00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:15.720]   our performance does degrade.
[00:58:15.720 --> 00:58:17.840]   And so in SEAL training, we're up for a week straight.
[00:58:17.840 --> 00:58:20.800]   We're up from a Sunday morning to a Friday afternoon in what's called hell week.
[00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:24.760]   You learn that you really can keep moving for literally a week straight.
[00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:27.600]   Yes, you get like 20 minutes of sleep on like the Wednesday.
[00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:30.160]   The instructors are like, oh, you're the best class we've ever seen.
[00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:32.280]   We're actually going to get you let you rest for a little bit.
[00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:35.160]   You lay down and then 20 minutes later, they wake you up with bullhorns
[00:58:35.160 --> 00:58:38.600]   and yelling at you to go jump in the Pacific Ocean at 62 degrees or whatever it is.
[00:58:38.600 --> 00:58:42.000]   Like these are things that you do stretch like we talked about before.
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:45.160]   So we all know that we can stay up for a week straight if we have to.
[00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:49.800]   But I don't think that operating on less sleep is something that you actually
[00:58:50.320 --> 00:58:51.920]   reap that many benefits from.
[00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:54.400]   I would encourage people to sleep as much as they humanly can.
[00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:58.360]   We're about to have baby number two, so I might have to take some of the lessons
[00:58:58.360 --> 00:59:00.200]   of knowing I can get by, but I agree.
[00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:03.240]   I think sleep's important, but appreciate you sharing.
[00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:07.560]   Before we wrap question, I like to ask everyone is to pick a place
[00:59:07.560 --> 00:59:11.320]   that you're familiar with and share to anyone who might end up in that city,
[00:59:11.320 --> 00:59:14.880]   a place you think they should go, grab a meal, grab a drink
[00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:16.920]   and an activity that they might want to do.
[00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:18.840]   That's that's not the most obvious thing to do.
[00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:22.400]   My happy place is Sonopee, New Hampshire, Lake Sonopee.
[00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:23.920]   It's fresh air.
[00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:25.680]   I'm in Westport, Connecticut right now.
[00:59:25.680 --> 00:59:28.280]   But we've got a place up in Sonopee, New Hampshire.
[00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:30.360]   That's where we really go when we want to get away.
[00:59:30.360 --> 00:59:34.520]   Beautiful little small town harbor in the fall.
[00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:35.840]   It's the leaves in the summer.
[00:59:35.840 --> 00:59:39.400]   It's the incredible swimming and harbor for seasons of fun there.
[00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:40.400]   It's a hidden gem.
[00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:43.720]   It's actually a little known fact that Steven Tyler is actually from Sonopee,
[00:59:43.720 --> 00:59:45.400]   New Hampshire. He lives down the road a bit.
[00:59:45.400 --> 00:59:48.800]   But other than Steven Tyler, there's not a lot of glitz and glam
[00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:49.880]   to Lake Sonopee.
[00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:51.520]   It's just a wonderful hidden gem.
[00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:54.640]   Chris, any place you'd say if someone's up there to.
[00:59:54.640 --> 00:59:56.720]   Is there a place to eat something to do?
[00:59:56.720 --> 00:59:59.320]   The Anchorage is a great place right in the harbor.
[00:59:59.320 --> 01:00:01.440]   The atmosphere could not be better.
[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:02.200]   That sounds great.
[01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:04.360]   Mike, I really enjoyed the book.
[01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:06.200]   What is next for you?
[01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:08.880]   Where can people stay in touch with everything you're working on
[01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:10.520]   and how can they support you?
[01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:13.440]   First and foremost, I'm loving helping transform VMware.
[01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:16.560]   But like many of us, we have a million things that we're doing in life.
[01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:21.120]   And one of mine is being on the board of the National Medal of Honor Museum,
[01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:24.080]   where we're on a mission to inspire America.
[01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:27.920]   We're building a new museum outside of AT&T and Stadium and in Dallas, Texas.
[01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:31.120]   And one of the things that I will do in the coming
[01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:34.320]   couple of months is to start a podcast with a lifelong friend of mine
[01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:38.120]   who is one of the nation's 66 living Medal of Honor recipients.
[01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:40.760]   His name is Britt Slabinski, affectionately Slab.
[01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:42.880]   Slab and I are going to co-host a podcast.
[01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:46.680]   We've got incredible people, lots of ex-presidents on the advisory board
[01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:50.960]   for the museum, people that I just am super excited to bring to life
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:54.360]   via a podcast associated with the Medal of Honor Museum.
[01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:56.680]   So I'd say lock in on Instagram.
[01:00:56.680 --> 01:00:59.400]   This is dot Mike Hayes or on Twitter.
[01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:00.800]   This is Mike Hayes.
[01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:04.000]   In the coming months, be bringing more and more Medal of Honor Museum
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.160]   and leadership content out.
[01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:07.880]   So love for people to follow and start getting at the front of the line.
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:10.240]   We will link to both those in the show notes.
[01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:11.800]   You mentioned the foundation you set up.
[01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:15.320]   Is that something people can read more about or is it kind of a private foundation?
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:16.880]   It's a 501 C three.
[01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:17.760]   It is Googleable.
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:20.000]   But I will tell you, we have no full time employees.
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.200]   We're all volunteers.
[01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:23.400]   And the best help that people can give is help.
[01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:23.960]   Never enough.
[01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:25.120]   Get out there in the world more.
[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:26.920]   Help elevate the conversation.
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:29.480]   All of those profits are going to gold star families.
[01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:33.400]   So I think the easiest ask and the best way to help is to get a copy
[01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:35.760]   or a couple of copies of Never Enough for your family and friends
[01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:38.680]   and people whose lives you want to positively influence.
[01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:41.280]   Mike, that's such a great idea.
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:42.680]   Thank you for writing this book.
[01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:44.160]   Thank you for being here.
[01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:46.520]   Now, thank you, my friend, and appreciate all that you're doing
[01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:47.840]   to make this great nation greater.
[01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:52.080]   I really hope you enjoyed this episode.
[01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:53.840]   Thank you so much for listening.
[01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:56.680]   If you haven't already left a rating and a review for the show
[01:01:56.680 --> 01:02:00.120]   in Apple podcasts or Spotify, I would really appreciate it.
[01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:04.120]   And if you have any feedback on the show, questions for me or just want to say hi,
[01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:08.240]   I'm Chris at all the hacks dot com or at Hutchins on Twitter.
[01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:09.600]   That's it for this week.
[01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:10.480]   I'll see you next week.
[01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:16.480]   [MUSIC]
