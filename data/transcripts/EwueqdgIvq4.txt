[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060]   The following is a conversation with Jeff Shainlein,
[00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.600]   a scientist at NIST
[00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.440]   interested in optoelectronic intelligence.
[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.160]   We have a deep technical dive into computing hardware
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.080]   that will make Jim Keller proud.
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.440]   I urge you to hop onto this rollercoaster ride
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.320]   through neuromorphic computing
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.720]   and superconducting electronics
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.360]   and hold on for dear life.
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.200]   Jeff is a great communicator of technical information.
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.160]   And so it was truly a pleasure to talk to him
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.300]   about some physics and engineering.
[00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.440]   To support this podcast,
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.440]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.880]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.360]   and here is my conversation with Jeff Shainlein.
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.920]   I got a chance to read a fascinating paper you authored
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.040]   called Optoelectronic Intelligence.
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.200]   So maybe we can start by talking about this paper
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.060]   and start with the basic questions.
[00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.360]   What is optoelectronic intelligence?
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.040]   - Yeah, so in that paper,
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.280]   the concept I was trying to describe
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.420]   is sort of an architecture for building
[00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.820]   brain-inspired computing
[00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.380]   that leverages light for communication
[00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.640]   in conjunction with electronic circuits for computation.
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.920]   In that particular paper,
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.880]   a lot of the work we're doing right now
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.000]   in our project at NIST
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.820]   is focused on superconducting electronics for computation.
[00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.720]   I'll go into why that is,
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.420]   but that might make a little more sense in context
[00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.420]   if we first describe what that is in contrast to,
[00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.880]   which is semiconducting electronics.
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.720]   So is it worth taking a couple minutes
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.820]   to describe semiconducting electronics?
[00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.960]   - It might even be worthwhile to step back
[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.960]   and talk about electricity and circuits
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.240]   and how circuits work
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.760]   before we talk about superconductivity.
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.460]   - Right, okay.
[00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.060]   - How does a computer work, Jeff?
[00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.780]   - Well, I won't go into everything
[00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.100]   that makes a computer work,
[00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.180]   but let's talk about the basic building blocks,
[00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.460]   a transistor, and even more basic than that,
[00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.500]   a semiconductor material, silicon, say.
[00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.460]   So in silicon, silicon is a semiconductor,
[00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.460]   and what that means is at low temperature,
[00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.780]   there are no free charges,
[00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.860]   no free electrons that can move around.
[00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.920]   So when you talk about electricity,
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.040]   you're talking about predominantly electrons
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.780]   moving to establish electrical currents,
[00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.080]   and they move under the influence of voltages.
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.620]   So you apply voltages, electrons move around,
[00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.400]   those can be measured as currents,
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.900]   and you can represent information in that way.
[00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.840]   So semiconductors are special
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.860]   in the sense that they are really malleable.
[00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.120]   So if you have a semiconductor material,
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.600]   you can change the number of free electrons
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.020]   that can move around by putting different elements,
[00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.280]   different atoms in lattice sites.
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.200]   So what is a lattice site?
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.200]   Well, a semiconductor is a crystal,
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.480]   which means all the atoms that comprise the material
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.000]   are at exact locations
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.880]   that are perfectly periodic in space.
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.200]   So if you started any one atom
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.660]   and you go along what are called the lattice vectors,
[00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.320]   you get to another atom and another atom and another atom,
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.440]   and for high-quality devices,
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.920]   it's important that it's a perfect crystal
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.800]   with very few defects,
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.440]   but you can intentionally replace a silicon atom
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.240]   with say a phosphorus atom,
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.160]   and then you can change the number of free electrons
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.980]   that are in a region of space
[00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.140]   that has that excess of what are called dopants.
[00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.260]   So picture a device that has a left terminal
[00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.040]   and a right terminal,
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.160]   and if you apply a voltage between those two,
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.760]   you can cause electrical current to flow between them.
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.120]   Now we add a third terminal up on top there,
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.800]   and depending on the voltage
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.160]   between the left and right terminal and that third voltage,
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.720]   you can change that current.
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.280]   So what's commonly done in digital electronic circuits
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.560]   is to leave a fixed voltage from left to right,
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.080]   and then change that voltage that's applied
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.200]   at what's called the gate, the gate of the transistor.
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.960]   So what you do is you make it to where
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.680]   there's an excess of electrons on the left,
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.360]   excess of electrons on the right,
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.880]   and very few electrons in the middle,
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.520]   and you do this by changing the concentration
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.800]   of different dopants in the lattice spatially.
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.880]   And then when you apply a voltage to that gate,
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.680]   you can either cause current to flow or turn it off.
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.440]   And so that's sort of your zero and one.
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.360]   If you apply voltage, current can flow,
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.360]   that current is representing a digital one,
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.960]   and from that, from that basic element,
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.180]   you can build up all the complexity
[00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.520]   of digital electronic circuits
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.080]   that have really had a profound influence on our society.
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.600]   - Now you're talking about electrons.
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.680]   Can you give a sense of what scale we're talking about
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.520]   when we're talking about in silicon
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.560]   being able to mass manufacture these kinds of gates?
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.480]   - Yeah, so scale in a number of different senses.
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.520]   Well, at the scale of the silicon lattice,
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.880]   the distance between two atoms there is half a nanometer.
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.480]   So people often like to compare these things
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.520]   to the width of a human hair.
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.020]   I think it's some six orders of magnitude smaller
[00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.440]   than the width of a human hair, something on that order.
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.840]   So remarkably small,
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.280]   we're talking about individual atoms here,
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.480]   and electrons are of that length scale
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.520]   when they're in that environment.
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.400]   But there's another sense that scale matters
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.380]   in digital electronics.
[00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.460]   This is perhaps the more important sense,
[00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:37.880]   although they're related.
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.360]   Scale refers to a number of things.
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.560]   It refers to the size of that transistor.
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.280]   So for example, I said you have a left contact,
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.800]   a right contact, and some space between them
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.240]   where the gate electrode sits.
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.000]   That's called the channel width or the channel length.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.120]   And what has enabled what we think of as Moore's law
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.040]   or the continued increased performance
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.560]   in silicon microelectronic circuits
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.940]   is the ability to make that size,
[00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.480]   that feature size ever smaller, ever smaller.
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.800]   At a really remarkable pace.
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:19.800]   I mean, that feature size has decreased consistently
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.760]   every couple of years since the 1960s.
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:27.160]   And that was what Moore predicted in the 1960s.
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.480]   He thought it would continue for at least two more decades,
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.800]   and it's been much longer than that.
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.800]   And so that is why we've been able to fit ever more devices,
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.180]   ever more transistors, ever more computational power
[00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.640]   on essentially the same size of chip.
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.600]   So a user sits back and does essentially nothing.
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.160]   You're running the same computer program,
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.680]   but those devices are getting smaller,
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.280]   so they get faster, they get more energy efficient,
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:51.700]   and all of our computing performance
[00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:53.440]   just continues to improve.
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.400]   And we don't have to think too hard
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:00.280]   about what we're doing as say a software designer
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:01.120]   or something like that.
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.720]   I absolutely don't mean to say that there's no innovation
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.400]   in software or the user side of things.
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.240]   Of course there is,
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.580]   but from the hardware perspective,
[00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.460]   we just have been given this gift
[00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:16.180]   of continued performance improvement through this scaling
[00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:19.300]   that is ever smaller feature sizes
[00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:22.900]   with very similar, say, power consumption.
[00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:26.100]   That power consumption has not continued to scale
[00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.500]   in the most recent decades,
[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:31.420]   but nevertheless, we had a really good run there for a while
[00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:34.380]   and now we're down to gates that are seven nanometers,
[00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:36.300]   which is state-of-the-art right now,
[00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.940]   maybe Global Foundries is trying to push it
[00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:39.780]   even lower than that.
[00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:42.600]   I can't keep up with where the predictions are
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:43.440]   that it's gonna end,
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:47.640]   but seven nanometer transistor
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.080]   has just a few tens of atoms
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.920]   along the length of the conduction pathway.
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:56.800]   So a naive semiconductor device physicist
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.760]   would think you can't go much further than that
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.060]   without some kind of revolution
[00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:04.000]   in the way we think about the physics of our devices.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.140]   - Is there something to be said
[00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:08.300]   about the mass manufacture of these devices?
[00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:09.500]   - Right, right, so that's another thing.
[00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:13.100]   So how have we been able to make those transistors
[00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:14.020]   smaller and smaller?
[00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:17.900]   Well, companies like Intel, Global Foundries,
[00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:20.460]   they invest a lot of money in the lithography.
[00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:22.980]   So how are these chips actually made?
[00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:24.500]   Well, one of the most important steps
[00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:27.840]   is this what's called ion implantation.
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:32.100]   So you start with sort of a pristine silicon crystal
[00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:34.240]   and then using photolithography,
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:37.560]   which is a technique where you can pattern different shapes
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:41.560]   using light, you can define which regions of space
[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:45.800]   you're going to implant with different species of ions
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:46.760]   that are going to change
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.700]   the local electrical properties right there.
[00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:52.840]   So by using ever shorter wavelengths of light
[00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.540]   and different kinds of optical techniques
[00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:56.760]   and different kinds of lithographic techniques,
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:01.140]   things that go far beyond my knowledge base,
[00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:03.520]   you can just simply shrink that feature size down.
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:04.860]   And you say you're at seven nanometers.
[00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:07.440]   Well, the wavelength of light that's being used
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.800]   is over a hundred nanometers.
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.280]   That's already deep in the UV.
[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:14.760]   So how are those minute features patterned?
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.960]   Well, there's an extraordinary amount of innovation
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:19.000]   that has gone into that, but nevertheless,
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.320]   it stayed very consistent
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.940]   in this ever shrinking feature size.
[00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:24.800]   And now the question is, can you make it smaller?
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:25.960]   And even if you do,
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:28.360]   do you still continue to get performance improvements?
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.280]   But that's another kind of scaling
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:34.320]   where these companies have been able to...
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:37.080]   So, okay, you picture a chip that has a processor on it.
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.820]   Well, that chip is not made as a chip.
[00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:40.920]   It's made on a wafer.
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:43.400]   And using photolithography,
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:46.200]   you basically print the same pattern
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.360]   on different dyes all across the wafer,
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:53.360]   multiple layers, tens, probably a hundred some layers
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:55.260]   in a mature foundry process.
[00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.620]   And you do this on ever bigger wafers too.
[00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:59.060]   That's another aspect of scaling
[00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:00.940]   that's occurred in the last several decades.
[00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:03.000]   So now you have this 300 millimeter wafer.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.320]   It's like as big as a pizza
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.560]   and it has maybe a thousand processors on it.
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.920]   And then you dice that up using a saw.
[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:11.800]   And now you can sell these things so cheap
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:15.200]   because the manufacturing process was so streamlined.
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.440]   I think a technology as revolutionary
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.360]   as Silicon Microelectronics
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:23.760]   has to have that kind of manufacturing scalability,
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.720]   which I will just emphasize,
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:29.220]   I believe is enabled by physics.
[00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:31.780]   It's not, I mean, of course there's human ingenuity
[00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:36.100]   that goes into it, but at least from my side, where I sit,
[00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:39.020]   it sure looks like the physics of our universe
[00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:41.140]   allows us to produce that.
[00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:45.980]   And we've discovered how more so than we've invented it.
[00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:47.420]   Although of course we have invented it.
[00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:48.720]   Humans have invented it,
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.220]   but it's almost as if it was there
[00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:53.220]   waiting for us to discover it.
[00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:54.420]   - You mean the entirety of it
[00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:56.180]   or are you specifically talking about
[00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:58.620]   the techniques of photolithography,
[00:10:58.620 --> 00:10:59.960]   like the optics involved?
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:02.860]   I mean the entirety of the scaling down
[00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:04.620]   to the seven nanometers,
[00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:08.500]   you're able to have electrons not interfere with each other
[00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:11.580]   in such a way that you could still have gates.
[00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:14.700]   Like that's enabled to achieve that scale,
[00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:16.860]   spatial and temporal.
[00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:18.700]   It seems to be very special
[00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:21.480]   and is enabled by the physics of our world.
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:22.760]   - All of the things you just said.
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:25.940]   So starting with the silicon material itself,
[00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:28.780]   silicon is a unique semiconductor.
[00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:31.540]   It has essentially ideal properties
[00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:33.700]   for making a specific kind of transistor
[00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:35.220]   that's extraordinarily useful.
[00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:39.540]   So I mentioned that silicon has,
[00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:40.620]   well, when you make a transistor,
[00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:42.020]   you have this gate contact
[00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:44.540]   that sits on top of the conduction channel.
[00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:47.260]   And depending on the voltage you apply there,
[00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.020]   you pull more carriers into the conduction channel
[00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:53.060]   or push them away so it becomes more or less conductive.
[00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:54.700]   In order to have that work
[00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:57.120]   without just sucking those carriers right into that contact,
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:59.260]   you need a very thin insulator.
[00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:03.220]   And part of scaling has been to gradually decrease
[00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:06.060]   the thickness of that gate insulator
[00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:09.060]   so that you can use a roughly similar voltage
[00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:12.080]   and still have the same current voltage characteristics.
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:14.600]   So the material that's used to do that,
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.900]   or I should say was initially used to do that,
[00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:18.720]   was silicon dioxide,
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:21.820]   which just naturally grows on the silicon surface.
[00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:25.100]   So you expose silicon to the atmosphere that we breathe.
[00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:27.580]   And well, if you're manufacturing,
[00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.740]   you're gonna purify these gases,
[00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:32.460]   but nevertheless, what's called a native oxide
[00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:33.500]   will grow there.
[00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:36.060]   There are essentially no other materials
[00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:37.500]   on the entire periodic table
[00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:41.900]   that have as good of a gate insulator
[00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:43.660]   as that silicon dioxide.
[00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:46.260]   And that has to do with nothing but the physics
[00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.240]   of the interaction between silicon and oxygen.
[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.240]   And if it wasn't that way,
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.040]   transistors could not,
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:57.960]   they could not perform in nearly the degree of capability
[00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:58.800]   that they have.
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:02.880]   And that has to do with the way that the oxide grows,
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.760]   the reduced density of defects there,
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:08.600]   its insulation, meaning essentially its energy gaps.
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.320]   You can apply a very large voltage there
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.260]   without having current leak through it.
[00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.500]   So that's physics right there.
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:16.880]   There are other things too.
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:20.040]   Silicon is a semiconductor in an elemental sense.
[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:21.560]   You only need silicon atoms.
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:22.820]   A lot of other semiconductors,
[00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:24.880]   you need two different kinds of atoms,
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.800]   like a compound from group three
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.580]   and a compound from group five.
[00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:31.680]   That opens you up to lots of defects that can occur
[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:34.640]   where one atom's not sitting quite at the lattice site it is
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:35.960]   and it's switched with another one.
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:38.280]   That degrades performance.
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:40.280]   But then also on the side that you mentioned
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:42.060]   with the manufacturing,
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:45.840]   we have access to light sources
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:48.560]   that can produce these very short wavelengths of light.
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:50.880]   How does photolithography occur?
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:54.460]   Well, you actually put this polymer on top of your wafer
[00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:56.200]   and you expose it to light.
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:00.080]   And then you use a aqueous chemical processing
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:03.440]   to dissolve away the regions that were exposed to light
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:05.960]   and leave the regions that were not.
[00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:08.560]   And we are blessed with these polymers
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:09.680]   that have the right property
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:13.600]   where they can cause scission events
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:16.200]   where the polymer splits where a photon hits.
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:19.760]   I mean, maybe that's not too surprising,
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:20.600]   but I don't know.
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.560]   It all comes together to have this
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:26.160]   really complex manufacturable ecosystem
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:30.640]   where very sophisticated technologies can be devised
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:33.040]   and it works quite well.
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:34.440]   - And amazingly, like you said,
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.280]   with a wavelength of like 100 nanometers
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:37.120]   or something like that,
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:39.760]   you're still able to achieve on this polymer
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:43.520]   precision of whatever we said, seven nanometers.
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:45.800]   I think I've heard like four nanometers
[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:48.440]   being talked about, something like that.
[00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:49.880]   If we could just pause on this
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.160]   and we'll return to superconductivity,
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:56.420]   but in this whole journey from a history perspective,
[00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:58.440]   what do you think is the most beautiful
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:01.760]   at the intersection of engineering and physics
[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:03.280]   to you in this whole process
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:06.560]   that we talked about with silicon and photolithography,
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:08.360]   things that people were able to achieve
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:12.320]   in order to push the Moore's law forward?
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:13.680]   Is it the early days,
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:16.280]   the invention of the transistor itself?
[00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:19.320]   Is it some particular cool little thing
[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:22.000]   that maybe not many people know about?
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.400]   Like, what do you think is the most beautiful
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:26.800]   in this whole process journey?
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:29.600]   - The most beautiful is a little difficult to answer.
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.040]   Let me try and sidestep it a little bit
[00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:34.760]   and just say what strikes me
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:39.760]   about looking at the history of silicon microelectronics
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:44.580]   is that, so when quantum mechanics was developed,
[00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:47.440]   people quickly began applying it to semiconductors
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:49.360]   and it was broadly understood
[00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:50.760]   that these are fascinating systems
[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:52.720]   and people cared about them for their basic physics,
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:55.040]   but also their utility as devices.
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:59.260]   And then the transistor was invented in the late 40s
[00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.040]   in a relatively crude experimental setup
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:04.240]   where you just crammed a metal electrode
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:08.000]   into the semiconductor and that was ingenious.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.960]   These people were able to make it work, you know?
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:16.800]   But so what I wanna get to that really strikes me
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:19.300]   is that in those early days,
[00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:21.160]   there were a number of different semiconductors
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:22.080]   that were being considered.
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.800]   They had different properties, different strengths,
[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:24.880]   different weaknesses.
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:28.440]   Most people thought germanium was the way to go.
[00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:33.440]   It had some nice properties related to things
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:37.280]   about how the electrons move inside the lattice,
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:39.760]   but other people thought that compound semiconductors
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:41.060]   with group three and group five
[00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:44.920]   also had really, really extraordinary properties
[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:50.060]   that might be conducive to making the best devices.
[00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:52.520]   So there were different groups exploring each of these
[00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:54.220]   and that's great, that's how science works.
[00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:56.120]   You have to cast a broad net.
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:17:01.120]   But then what I find striking is why is it that silicon won?
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:05.240]   Because it's not that germanium is a useless material
[00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:06.720]   and it's not present in technology
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:08.060]   or compound semiconductors.
[00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:12.600]   They're both doing exciting and important things,
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:14.360]   slightly more niche applications,
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:18.040]   whereas silicon is the semiconductor material
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:20.060]   for microelectronics, which is the platform
[00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:22.720]   for digital computing, which has transformed our world.
[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:24.160]   Why did silicon win?
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:28.720]   It's because of a remarkable assemblage of qualities
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:32.120]   that no one of them was the clear winner,
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:34.580]   but it made these sort of compromises
[00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:36.680]   between a number of different influences.
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:40.520]   It had that really excellent gate oxide
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:43.240]   that allowed us to make MOSFETs,
[00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:45.400]   these high-performance transistors,
[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:47.200]   so quickly and cheaply and easily
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:49.560]   without having to do a lot of materials development.
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:53.400]   The band gap of silicon is actually...
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:56.240]   So in a semiconductor, there's an important parameter,
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:57.440]   which is called the band gap,
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:59.220]   which tells you if you...
[00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:02.280]   There are sort of electrons that fill up to one level
[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:05.560]   in the energy diagram, and then there's a gap
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:07.480]   where electrons aren't allowed to have an energy
[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:08.320]   in a certain range,
[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:11.300]   and then there's another energy level above that.
[00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:14.920]   And that difference between the lower sort of filled level
[00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:16.860]   and the unoccupied level,
[00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:19.600]   that tells you how much voltage you have to apply
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:22.120]   in order to induce a current to flow.
[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:27.120]   So with germanium, that's about 0.75 electron volts.
[00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:29.600]   That means you have to apply 0.75 volts
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:31.960]   to get a current moving.
[00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:34.240]   And it turns out that if you compare that
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:38.480]   to the thermal excitations that are induced
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:40.660]   just by the temperature of our environment,
[00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:42.080]   that gap's not quite big enough.
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:45.080]   You start to use it to perform computations,
[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:45.940]   it gets a little hot,
[00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:48.120]   and you get all these accidental carriers
[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:50.720]   that are excited into the conduction band,
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:53.340]   and it causes errors in your computation.
[00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:56.180]   Silicon's band gap is just a little higher,
[00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:58.960]   1.1 electron volts,
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:01.300]   but you have an exponential dependence
[00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:04.220]   on the number of carriers that are present
[00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:06.640]   that can induce those errors.
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.480]   It decays exponentially with that voltage.
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:12.780]   So just that slight extra energy in that band gap
[00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:17.040]   really puts it in an ideal position to be operated
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:20.240]   in the conditions of our ambient environment.
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:21.440]   - It's kind of fascinating that,
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:22.480]   so like you mentioned,
[00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:27.480]   errors decrease exponentially with the voltage.
[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:32.020]   So it's funny 'cause this error thing comes up
[00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:34.620]   when you start talking about quantum computing.
[00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:36.020]   It's kind of amazing that everything
[00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:37.060]   we've been talking about,
[00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:39.480]   the errors as we scale down,
[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:41.500]   seems to be extremely low.
[00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:42.340]   - Yes.
[00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:45.380]   - And like all of our computation
[00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:47.740]   is based on the assumption that it's extremely low.
[00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:49.540]   - Yes, well it's digital computation.
[00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:51.460]   - Digital, sorry, digital computation.
[00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:54.260]   So as opposed to our biological computation,
[00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:55.700]   our brain is like,
[00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:59.100]   the assumption is stuff is gonna fail all over the place
[00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:01.740]   and we somehow have to still be robust to that.
[00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:03.060]   - That's exactly right.
[00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:04.180]   - So this also,
[00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:05.820]   this is gonna be the most controversial part
[00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:07.780]   of our conversation where you're gonna make some enemies.
[00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:09.040]   So let me ask,
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:11.840]   'cause we've been talking about physics and engineering.
[00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:15.740]   Which group of people is smarter
[00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:17.780]   and more important for this one?
[00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:20.540]   Let me ask the question in a better way.
[00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:22.580]   Some of the big innovations,
[00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:25.740]   some of the beautiful things that we've been talking about,
[00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:26.980]   how much of it is physics?
[00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:28.420]   How much of it is engineering?
[00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:30.260]   My dad is a physicist
[00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:33.260]   and he talks down to all the amazing engineering
[00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:36.940]   that we're doing in the artificial intelligence
[00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:38.780]   and the computer science and the robotics
[00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:39.620]   and all that space.
[00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:41.660]   So we argue about this all the time.
[00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:42.500]   So what do you think?
[00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:43.920]   Who gets more credit?
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:45.420]   - I'm genuinely not trying
[00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:46.780]   to just be politically correct here.
[00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:49.060]   I don't see how you would have
[00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:51.180]   any of the, what we consider
[00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:54.140]   sort of the great accomplishments of society without both.
[00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:55.860]   You absolutely need both of those things.
[00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:59.660]   Physics tends to play a key role earlier in the development
[00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:04.660]   and then engineering, optimization, these things take over.
[00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:09.220]   And I mean, the invention of the transistor,
[00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:10.860]   or actually even before that,
[00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:12.860]   the understanding of semiconductor physics
[00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:14.800]   that allowed the invention of the transistor,
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:15.640]   that's all physics.
[00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:16.940]   So if you didn't have that physics,
[00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:20.260]   you don't even get to get on the field.
[00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:24.180]   But once you have understood and demonstrated
[00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:26.500]   that this is in principle possible,
[00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:28.380]   more so as engineering,
[00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:32.140]   why we have computers more powerful
[00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:36.380]   than old supercomputers in each of our phones,
[00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:37.460]   that's all engineering.
[00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:42.160]   And I think I would be quite foolish to say that,
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:44.980]   that that's not valuable,
[00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:46.940]   that that's not a great contribution.
[00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:47.820]   - It's a beautiful dance.
[00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:49.740]   Would you put like silicon,
[00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:52.780]   the understanding of the material properties
[00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:54.340]   in the space of engineering?
[00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:55.700]   Like how does that whole process work
[00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:58.000]   to understand that it has all these nice properties
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.240]   or even the development of photolithography?
[00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:03.820]   Is that basically,
[00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:06.140]   would you put that in a category of engineering?
[00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:09.940]   - No, I would say that it is basic physics,
[00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:12.740]   it is applied physics, it's material science,
[00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:16.060]   it's x-ray crystallography,
[00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:18.580]   it's polymer chemistry, it's everything.
[00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:20.260]   - So chemistry even is thrown in there?
[00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:21.580]   - Absolutely, yes.
[00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:22.580]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:23.840]   - Just no biology.
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:25.340]   (laughing)
[00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:26.580]   - We can get to biology.
[00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:28.260]   - Well, the biology is in the humans
[00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:29.500]   that are engineering the system,
[00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:31.220]   so it's all integrated deeply.
[00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:32.580]   Okay, so let's return,
[00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:35.660]   you mentioned this word superconductivity.
[00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:38.620]   So what does that have to do with what we're talking about?
[00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:40.540]   - Right, okay, so in a semiconductor,
[00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:44.260]   as I tried to describe a second ago,
[00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:49.260]   you can sort of induce currents by applying voltages
[00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:52.280]   and those have sort of typical properties
[00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:55.400]   that you would expect from some kind of a conductor.
[00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:57.060]   Those electrons,
[00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:00.360]   they don't just flow perfectly without dissipation.
[00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:03.240]   If an electron collides with an imperfection in the lattice
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:05.580]   or another electron, it's gonna slow down,
[00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:06.860]   it's gonna lose its momentum.
[00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:09.260]   So you have to keep applying that voltage
[00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:11.420]   in order to keep the current flowing.
[00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:13.420]   In a superconductor, something different happens.
[00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:16.540]   If you get a current to start flowing,
[00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:18.260]   it will continue to flow indefinitely.
[00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:19.860]   There's no dissipation.
[00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:21.660]   So that's crazy.
[00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:22.500]   How does that happen?
[00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:26.820]   Well, it happens at low temperature and this is crucial.
[00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:30.200]   It has to be a quite low temperature
[00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:32.780]   and what I'm talking about there,
[00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:35.780]   for essentially all of our conversation,
[00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:38.660]   I'm gonna be talking about conventional superconductors
[00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:42.220]   sometimes called low TC superconductors,
[00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:45.120]   low critical temperature superconductors.
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:49.820]   And so those materials have to be at a temperature
[00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:51.960]   around, say around four Kelvin.
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:54.560]   I mean, their critical temperature might be 10 Kelvin,
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:55.400]   something like that,
[00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:57.120]   but you wanna operate them at around four Kelvin,
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:59.300]   four degrees above absolute zero.
[00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:01.640]   And what happens at that temperature,
[00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:03.900]   at very low temperatures in certain materials
[00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:08.900]   is that the noise of atoms moving around,
[00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:11.900]   the lattice vibrating,
[00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:13.580]   electrons colliding with each other,
[00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:15.100]   that becomes sufficiently low
[00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:18.580]   that the electrons can settle into this very special state.
[00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:22.260]   It's sometimes referred to as a macroscopic quantum state
[00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:26.560]   because if I had a piece of superconducting material here,
[00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:30.940]   let's say niobium is a very typical superconductor.
[00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:33.620]   If I had a block of niobium here
[00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:36.700]   and we cooled it below its critical temperature,
[00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:40.820]   all of the electrons in that superconducting state
[00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:42.860]   would be in one coherent quantum state.
[00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:46.500]   The wave function of that state
[00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:49.740]   is described in terms of all of the particles simultaneously
[00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:52.220]   but it extends across macroscopic dimensions,
[00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:53.700]   the size of whatever material,
[00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:56.100]   the size of whatever block of that material
[00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:57.060]   I have sitting here.
[00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:59.440]   And the way this occurs is that,
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:03.480]   let's try to be a little bit light on the technical details,
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:06.500]   but essentially the electrons coordinate with each other.
[00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:10.300]   They are able to, in this macroscopic quantum state,
[00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:12.260]   they're able to sort of,
[00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:14.380]   one can quickly take the place of the other.
[00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:15.780]   You can't tell electrons apart,
[00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:17.740]   they're what's known as identical particles.
[00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:22.020]   So if this electron runs into a defect
[00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:24.980]   that would otherwise cause it to scatter,
[00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:29.980]   it can just sort of almost miraculously avoid that defect
[00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:32.220]   because it's not really in that location,
[00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:33.960]   it's part of a macroscopic quantum state
[00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:35.640]   and the entire quantum state
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:37.100]   was not scattered by that defect.
[00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:40.720]   So you can get a current that flows without dissipation
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:42.920]   and that's called a super current.
[00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:47.400]   That's sort of just very much scratching the surface
[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:49.800]   of superconductivity.
[00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:52.200]   There's very deep and rich physics there,
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.480]   just probably not the main subject
[00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:55.600]   we need to go into right now,
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:26:00.480]   but it turns out that when you have this material,
[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:03.540]   you can do usual things like make wires out of it
[00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:05.040]   so you can get current to flow
[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:06.400]   in a straight line on a chip,
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:08.880]   but you can also make other devices
[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:11.860]   that perform different kinds of operations.
[00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:14.720]   Some of them are kind of logic operations
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:16.680]   like you'd get in a transistor.
[00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:21.680]   The most common or most, I would say,
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:26.880]   diverse in its utility component is a Josephson junction.
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:30.000]   It's not analogous to a transistor in the sense that
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.440]   if you apply a voltage here,
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:33.840]   it changes how much current flows from left to right,
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:37.160]   but it is analogous in sort of a sense of
[00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:41.020]   it's the go-to component that a circuit engineer
[00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:44.480]   is going to use to start to build up more complexity.
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:48.800]   - So these junctions serve as gates?
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:50.600]   - They can serve as gates.
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:56.520]   I'm not sure how concerned to be with semantics,
[00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:59.440]   but let me just briefly say what a Josephson junction is
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:02.240]   and we can talk about different ways that they can be used.
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:05.280]   Basically, if you have a superconducting wire
[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:09.680]   and then a small gap of a different material
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:13.520]   that's not superconducting, an insulator or normal metal,
[00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:15.800]   and then another superconducting wire on the other side,
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:17.020]   that's a Josephson junction.
[00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:18.600]   So it's sometimes referred to
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:20.320]   as a superconducting weak link.
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:24.200]   So you have this superconducting state on one side
[00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:25.080]   and on the other side
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:27.520]   and the superconducting wave function
[00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:30.680]   actually tunnels across that gap.
[00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:35.440]   And when you create such a physical entity,
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:40.440]   it has very unusual current voltage characteristics.
[00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:44.280]   - Within that gap, like weird stuff happens.
[00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:45.120]   - Through the entire circuit.
[00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:47.560]   So you can imagine, suppose you had a loop setup
[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:51.200]   that had one of those weak links in the loop.
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:53.200]   Current would flow in that loop
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:55.600]   independent even if you hadn't applied a voltage to it
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:57.000]   and that's called the Josephson effect.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.520]   So the fact that there's this phase difference
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:02.160]   in the quantum wave function
[00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:04.400]   from one side of the tunneling barrier to the other
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:05.760]   induces current to flow.
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:07.720]   - So how does he change state?
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:08.560]   - Right, exactly.
[00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:09.580]   So how do you change state?
[00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:13.900]   Now picture if I have a current bias coming down
[00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:14.920]   this line of my circuit
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:18.120]   and there's a Josephson junction right in the middle of it.
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:19.960]   And now I make another wire
[00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:21.800]   that goes around the Josephson junction.
[00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:24.600]   So I have a loop here, a superconducting loop.
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:27.960]   I can add current to that loop
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:30.840]   by exceeding the critical current of that Josephson junction.
[00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:33.960]   So like any superconducting material,
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:37.680]   it can carry this super current that I've described,
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:40.520]   this current that can propagate without dissipation
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:41.840]   up to a certain level.
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:44.240]   And if you try and pass more current than that
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:45.920]   through the material,
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:49.200]   it's going to become a resistive material,
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:51.120]   a normal material.
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:54.120]   So in the Josephson junction, the same thing happens.
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:57.120]   I can bias it above its critical current.
[00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:58.200]   And then what it's gonna do,
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:03.200]   it's going to add a quantized amount of current
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.360]   into that loop.
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:06.320]   And what I mean by quantized is
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:08.980]   it's going to come in discrete packets
[00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:11.200]   with a well-defined value of current.
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:15.040]   So in the vernacular of some people
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:16.860]   working in this community,
[00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:20.200]   you would say you pop a flux on into the loop.
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:21.720]   So a flux on--
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:23.680]   - You pop a flux on into the loop.
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:24.520]   - Yeah, so a flux on--
[00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:26.480]   - Sounds like skateboarder talk, I love it.
[00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:27.440]   (Lex laughing)
[00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:28.920]   Sorry, go ahead.
[00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:31.200]   - A flux on is one of these quantized
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:35.200]   amounts of current that you can add to a loop.
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:36.600]   And this is a cartoon picture,
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:38.440]   but I think it's sufficient for our purposes.
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:40.780]   - So which, maybe it's useful to say,
[00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:43.720]   what is the speed at which
[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:47.000]   these discrete packets of current travel?
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.160]   Because we'll be talking about light a little bit.
[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:51.080]   It seems like the speed is important.
[00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:53.560]   - The speed is important, that's an excellent question.
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:57.800]   Sometimes I wonder how you became so astute.
[00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:00.800]   But so this--
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:04.400]   - Matrix 4 is coming out, so maybe that's related.
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:05.240]   I'm not sure.
[00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:06.920]   I'm dressed for the job.
[00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:09.360]   I was trying to become an extra on Matrix 4,
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:10.680]   it didn't work out.
[00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:13.280]   Anyway, so what's the speed of these packets?
[00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:15.000]   - You'll have to find another gig.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.600]   - I know, I'm sorry.
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:19.400]   - So the speed of the packet is actually these flux ons,
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:24.280]   these sort of pulses of current
[00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:26.160]   that are generated by Joseph's injunctions.
[00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:27.640]   They can actually propagate
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:29.720]   very close to the speed of light,
[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:31.880]   maybe something like a third of the speed of light.
[00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:32.840]   That's quite fast.
[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:37.240]   So one of the reasons why Joseph's injunctions are appealing
[00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:40.560]   is because their signals can propagate quite fast
[00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:43.400]   and they can also switch very fast.
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:46.040]   What I mean by switch is perform that operation
[00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:49.400]   that I described where you add current to the loop.
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:53.920]   That can happen within a few tens of picoseconds.
[00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:56.840]   So you can get devices that operate
[00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:58.800]   in the hundreds of gigahertz range.
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:02.040]   And by comparison, most processors
[00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:04.920]   in our conventional computers operate closer
[00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:08.320]   to the one gigahertz range, maybe three gigahertz
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:12.560]   seems to be kind of where those speeds have leveled out.
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:14.200]   - So the gamers listening to this
[00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:15.560]   are getting really excited
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:17.680]   that overclocked their system to like,
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:19.560]   what is it like four gigahertz or something?
[00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:21.960]   100 sounds incredible.
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:24.040]   Can I just, as a tiny tangent,
[00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:26.880]   is the physics of this understood well
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:28.520]   how to do this stably?
[00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:30.160]   - Oh yes, the physics is understood well.
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:32.560]   The physics of Joseph's injunctions is understood well.
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:34.520]   The technology is understood quite well too.
[00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:37.640]   The reasons why it hasn't displaced
[00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:41.720]   silicon microelectronics in conventional digital computing,
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:45.040]   I think are more related to what I was alluding to before
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:49.240]   about the myriad practical, almost mundane aspects
[00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:52.080]   of silicon that make it so useful.
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:55.880]   You can make a transistor ever smaller and smaller
[00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:58.840]   and it will still perform its digital function quite well.
[00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:00.760]   The same is not true of a Joseph's injunction.
[00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:02.400]   You really, they don't, they just,
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:04.440]   it's not the same thing that there's this feature
[00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:06.280]   that you can keep making smaller and smaller
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:08.200]   and it'll keep performing the same operations.
[00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:11.480]   This loop I described, any Joseph's in circuit,
[00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:13.120]   well, I want to be careful,
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:14.680]   I shouldn't say any Joseph's in circuit,
[00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:17.240]   but many Joseph's in circuits,
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:19.440]   the way they process information
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:21.280]   or the way they perform whatever function it is
[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:22.120]   they're trying to do,
[00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:24.560]   maybe it's sensing a weak magnetic field,
[00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:27.480]   it depends on an interplay between the junction
[00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:28.800]   and that loop.
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:30.560]   And you can't make that loop much smaller.
[00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:32.120]   And it's not for practical reasons
[00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:33.480]   that have to do with lithography.
[00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:35.680]   It's for fundamental physical reasons
[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:38.960]   about the way the magnetic field interacts
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:41.160]   with that superconducting material.
[00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:43.800]   There are physical limits that no matter
[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:45.920]   how good our technology got,
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:47.840]   those circuits would, I think,
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:50.360]   would never be able to be scaled down
[00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:54.380]   to the densities that silicon microelectronics can.
[00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:55.560]   - I don't know if we mentioned,
[00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:56.960]   is there something interesting
[00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:00.200]   about the various superconducting materials involved?
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:01.040]   Or is it all--
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:02.640]   - There's a lot of stuff that's interesting.
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:04.440]   - And it's not silicon.
[00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:05.840]   - It's not silicon, no.
[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:08.400]   - So like it's some materials
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:12.040]   that also require to be super cold for Kelvin and so on.
[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:15.320]   - Yes, so let's dissect a couple of those different things.
[00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:18.520]   The super cold part, let me just mention,
[00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:20.120]   for your gamers out there that are trying
[00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:21.360]   to clock it at four gigahertz
[00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:22.200]   and would love to go to 400.
[00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:24.160]   - Yeah, what kind of cooling system can achieve four Kelvin?
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:26.320]   - For Kelvin, you need liquid helium.
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:29.920]   And so liquid helium is expensive, it's inconvenient.
[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:32.120]   You need a cryostat that sits there
[00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:36.560]   and the energy consumption of that cryostat
[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:40.080]   is impracticable for, it's not going in your cell phone.
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:42.080]   So you can picture holding your cell phone like this
[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:46.160]   and then something the size of a keg of beer
[00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:47.840]   or something on your back to cool it,
[00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:49.560]   like that makes no sense.
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:54.140]   So if you're trying to make this in consumer devices,
[00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:57.040]   electronics that are ubiquitous across society,
[00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:59.280]   superconductors are not in the race for that.
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:01.040]   - For now, but you're saying,
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:03.280]   so just to frame the conversation,
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:06.560]   maybe the thing we're focused on is computing systems
[00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:10.360]   that serve as servers, like large systems.
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:11.400]   - Yes, large systems.
[00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:14.800]   So then you can contrast what's going on in your cell phone
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:18.240]   with what's going on at one of the supercomputers.
[00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:22.080]   Colleague Katie Schumann invited us out to Oak Ridge
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:24.080]   a few years ago, so we got to see Titan
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:26.120]   and that was when they were building Summit.
[00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:29.480]   So these are some high performance supercomputers
[00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:32.480]   out in Tennessee and those are filling entire rooms
[00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:33.920]   the size of warehouses.
[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:35.920]   So once you're at that level,
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:37.760]   okay, there you're already putting a lot of power
[00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:42.280]   into cooling, cooling is part of your engineering task
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:43.600]   that you have to deal with.
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:45.600]   So there it's not entirely obvious
[00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:49.480]   that cooling to four Kelvin is out of the question.
[00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:53.240]   It has not happened yet and I can speak to why that is
[00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:55.520]   in the digital domain if you're interested.
[00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:57.640]   I think it's not going to happen.
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:01.240]   I don't think superconductors are gonna replace
[00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:04.640]   semiconductors for digital computation.
[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:07.600]   There are a lot of reasons for that,
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:09.740]   but I think ultimately what it comes down to
[00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:13.400]   is all things considered, cooling, errors,
[00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:16.040]   scaling down to feature sizes, all that stuff,
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:19.360]   semiconductors work better at the system level.
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:22.680]   - Is there some aspect of just curious
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:25.500]   about the historical momentum of this?
[00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:28.160]   Is there some power to the momentum of an industry
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:31.160]   that's mass manufacturing using a certain material?
[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:33.640]   Is this like a Titanic shifting?
[00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:34.840]   Like, what's your sense?
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:37.080]   When a good idea comes along,
[00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:39.880]   how good does that idea need to be
[00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:42.600]   for the Titanic to start shifting?
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:44.160]   - That's an excellent question.
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:46.500]   That's an excellent way to frame it.
[00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:51.280]   And you know, I don't know the answer to that,
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:54.660]   but what I think is, okay, so the history
[00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:57.960]   of the superconducting logic goes back to the 70s.
[00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:00.520]   IBM made a big push to do superconducting
[00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:02.360]   digital computing in the 70s.
[00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:06.080]   And they made some choices about their devices
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:09.400]   and their architectures and things that in hindsight
[00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:10.980]   were kind of doomed to fail.
[00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:13.120]   And I don't mean any disrespect for the people that did it.
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:14.260]   It was hard to see at the time.
[00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:17.860]   But then another generation of superconducting logic
[00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:22.280]   was introduced, I wanna say the 90s.
[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:24.960]   Someone named Likorev and Seminov,
[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:28.240]   they proposed an entire family of circuits
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:29.920]   based on Josephson junctions
[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:33.420]   that are doing digital computing based on logic gates
[00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:36.560]   and or not these kinds of things.
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:41.520]   And they showed how it could go hundreds of times faster
[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:43.160]   than silicon microelectronics.
[00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:45.320]   And it's extremely exciting.
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:47.000]   I wasn't working in the field at that time,
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.520]   but later when I went back and read the literature,
[00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:51.980]   I was just like, wow, this is so awesome.
[00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:55.940]   And so you might think, well,
[00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:58.240]   the reason why it didn't display silicon
[00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:00.360]   is because silicon already had so much momentum
[00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:01.680]   at that time.
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:02.920]   But that was the 90s.
[00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:04.280]   Silicon kept that momentum
[00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:06.920]   because it had the simple way to keep getting better.
[00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:08.680]   You just make features smaller and smaller.
[00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:11.760]   So it would have to be,
[00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:13.520]   I don't think it would have to be that much better
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:15.400]   than silicon to displace it.
[00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:17.760]   But the problem is it's just not better than silicon.
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:19.920]   It might be better than silicon in one metric,
[00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:21.400]   speed of a switching operation
[00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:24.360]   or power consumption of a switching operation.
[00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:26.000]   But building a digital computer
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.680]   is a lot more than just that elemental operation.
[00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:31.000]   It's everything that goes into it,
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.280]   including the manufacturing, including the packaging,
[00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:38.280]   including the various materials aspects of things.
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:40.560]   So the reason why,
[00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:42.760]   and even in some of those early papers,
[00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:44.080]   I can't remember which one it was,
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:47.440]   Likorev said something along the lines of,
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:49.860]   you can see how we could build an entire family
[00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:52.760]   of digital electronic circuits based on these components.
[00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:54.960]   They could go a hundred or more times faster
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:59.280]   than semiconductor logic gates.
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:00.860]   But I don't think that's the right way
[00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:02.640]   to use superconducting electronic circuits.
[00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:04.280]   He didn't say what the right way was,
[00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:07.400]   but he basically said digital logic
[00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:11.240]   trying to steal the show from silicon
[00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:13.400]   is probably not what these circuits
[00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:16.320]   are most suited to accomplish.
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:18.120]   - So if we can just linger on,
[00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:20.800]   you used the word computation.
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:24.060]   When you talk about computation, how do you think about it?
[00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:28.900]   Do you think purely on just the switching,
[00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:31.320]   or do you think something a little bit larger scale,
[00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:32.720]   a circuit taken together,
[00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:36.940]   performing the basic arithmetic operations
[00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:40.400]   that are then required to do the kind of computation
[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:42.160]   that makes up a computer?
[00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:44.400]   'Cause when we talk about the speed of computation,
[00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:46.960]   is it boiled down to the basic switching,
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:49.160]   or is there some bigger picture that you're thinking about?
[00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:52.320]   - Well, all right, so maybe we should disambiguate.
[00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:55.580]   There are a variety of different kinds of computation.
[00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:57.140]   I don't pretend to be an expert
[00:38:57.140 --> 00:39:00.140]   in the theory of computation or anything like that.
[00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:02.620]   I guess it's important to differentiate though
[00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:05.760]   between digital logic,
[00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:09.740]   which represents information as a series of bits,
[00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:12.980]   binary digits, which you can think of them
[00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:14.120]   as zeros and ones or whatever.
[00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:17.360]   Usually they correspond to a physical system
[00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:21.180]   that has two very well separated states.
[00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:22.820]   And then other kinds of computation,
[00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:25.240]   like we'll get into more the way your brain works,
[00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:27.560]   which it is, I think,
[00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:30.380]   indisputably processing information,
[00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:34.060]   but where the computation begins and ends
[00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:36.320]   is not anywhere near as well defined.
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:39.640]   It doesn't depend on these two levels.
[00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:41.280]   Here's a zero, here's a one.
[00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:42.600]   There's a lot of gray area
[00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:45.600]   that's usually referred to as analog computing.
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:49.840]   Also in conventional digital computers,
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:54.200]   or digital computers in general,
[00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:57.280]   you have a concept of what's called arithmetic depth,
[00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:59.780]   which is jargon that basically means
[00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:03.820]   how many sequential operations are performed
[00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:07.640]   to turn an input into an output.
[00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:10.880]   And those kinds of computations in digital systems
[00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:14.460]   are highly serial, meaning that data streams,
[00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:16.480]   they don't branch off too far to the side.
[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:18.880]   You do, you have to pull some information over there
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:20.880]   and access memory from here and stuff like that.
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:24.320]   But by and large, the computation proceeds
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:26.200]   in a serial manner.
[00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:27.720]   It's not that way in the brain.
[00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:30.720]   In the brain, you're always drawing information
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:31.560]   from different places.
[00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:33.760]   It's much more network-based computing.
[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:35.640]   Neurons don't wait for their turn.
[00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:37.160]   They fire when they're ready to fire.
[00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:39.160]   And so it's asynchronous.
[00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:41.640]   So one of the other things about a digital system
[00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:44.480]   is you're performing these operations on a clock.
[00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:46.680]   And that's a crucial aspect of it.
[00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:48.880]   Get rid of a clock in a digital system,
[00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:50.440]   nothing makes sense anymore.
[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:51.560]   The brain has no clock.
[00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:55.300]   It builds its own time scales based on its internal activity.
[00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:59.120]   - So you can think of the brain as kind of,
[00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:00.920]   I like this, like network computation
[00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:04.600]   where it's actually really trivial, simple computers,
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:09.000]   just a huge number of them, and they're networked.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.980]   - I would say it is complex, sophisticated,
[00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:14.400]   little processors, and there's a huge number of them.
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:16.200]   Neurons are not-- - No offense,
[00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:17.600]   I don't mean to offend neurons.
[00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:19.800]   They're very complicated and beautiful.
[00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:21.960]   But we often oversimplify them.
[00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:25.680]   Yes, there's computation happening within a neuron.
[00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:29.520]   - Right, so I would say to think of a transistor
[00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:32.360]   as the building block of a digital computer is accurate.
[00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:34.680]   You use a few transistors to make your logic gates.
[00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:37.840]   You build up processors from logic gates
[00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:39.160]   and things like that.
[00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:40.600]   So you can think of a transistor
[00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:42.300]   as a fundamental building block,
[00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:44.600]   or you can think of, as we get into more
[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:46.360]   highly parallelized architectures,
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:47.680]   you can think of a processor
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:49.320]   as a fundamental building block.
[00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:53.160]   To make the analogy to the neuro side of things,
[00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:55.320]   a neuron is not a transistor.
[00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:57.320]   A neuron is a processor.
[00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:58.560]   It has synapses.
[00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:00.220]   Even synapses are not transistors,
[00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:04.800]   but they are lower on the information processing hierarchy
[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:05.640]   in a sense.
[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:08.200]   They do a bulk of the computation,
[00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:13.200]   but neurons are entire processors in and of themselves
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:16.280]   that can take in many different kinds of inputs
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:18.840]   on many different spatial and temporal scales
[00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:20.840]   and produce many different kinds of outputs
[00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:23.840]   so that they can perform different computations
[00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:24.880]   in different contexts.
[00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:27.440]   - So this is where it enters this distinction
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:30.760]   between computation and communication.
[00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:34.140]   So you can think of neuron as performing computation
[00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:39.000]   and the networking, the interconnectivity of neurons
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.920]   is communication between neurons.
[00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:43.480]   And you see this with very large server systems
[00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:46.160]   I mentioned offline, I've been talking to Jim Keller
[00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:48.580]   whose dream is to build giant computers that,
[00:42:48.580 --> 00:42:52.400]   you know, the bottom like there's often the communication
[00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:54.700]   between the different pieces of computing.
[00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:57.400]   So in this paper that we mentioned,
[00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:59.680]   Optoelectronic Intelligence,
[00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:03.200]   you say electrons excel at computation
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:08.200]   while light is excellent for communication.
[00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:11.040]   Maybe you can linger and say in this context,
[00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:13.980]   what do you mean by computation and communication?
[00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:16.080]   What are electrons?
[00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:17.440]   What is light?
[00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:20.660]   And why do they excel at those two tasks?
[00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:23.620]   - Yeah, just to first speak to computation
[00:43:23.620 --> 00:43:27.700]   versus communication, I would say computation
[00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:31.620]   is essentially taking in some information,
[00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:34.680]   performing operations on that information
[00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:39.040]   and producing new, hopefully more useful information.
[00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:44.040]   So for example, imagine you have a picture in front of you
[00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:48.960]   and there is a key in it and that's what you're looking for
[00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:50.680]   for whatever reason, you wanna find the key,
[00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:51.560]   we all wanna find the key.
[00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:56.540]   So the input is that entire picture
[00:43:56.540 --> 00:43:59.040]   and the output might be the coordinates where the key is.
[00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:01.520]   So you've reduced the total amount of information you have,
[00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:03.000]   but you found the useful information
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.380]   for you in that present moment,
[00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:05.220]   that's the useful information.
[00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:07.160]   - And you think about this computation
[00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:10.840]   as the controlled synchronous sequential--
[00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:12.680]   - Not necessarily, it could be.
[00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:16.240]   That could be how your system is performing the computation
[00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:19.320]   or it could be asynchronous.
[00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:21.420]   There are lots of ways to find the key.
[00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:23.720]   It depends on the nature of the data,
[00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:27.560]   it depends on, that's a very simplified example,
[00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:28.720]   a picture with a key in it.
[00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:30.540]   What about if you're in the world
[00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:32.520]   and you're trying to decide the best way
[00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:35.960]   to live your life, you know?
[00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:38.600]   It might be interactive, there might be some recurrence
[00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:41.360]   or some weird asynchrony, I got it.
[00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:43.280]   But there's an input and there's an output
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:44.440]   and you do some stuff in the middle
[00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:46.040]   that actually goes from the input to the output.
[00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:47.360]   - You've taken in information
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:49.080]   and output different information,
[00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:51.800]   hopefully reducing the total amount of information
[00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:53.800]   and extracting what's useful.
[00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:57.760]   Communication is then getting that information
[00:44:57.760 --> 00:44:59.440]   from the location in which it's stored
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:02.680]   because information is physical as Landauer emphasized
[00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:05.120]   and so it is in one place
[00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:07.840]   and you need to get that information to another place
[00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:10.120]   so that something else can use it
[00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:12.020]   for whatever computation it's working on.
[00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:13.440]   Maybe it's part of the same network
[00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:15.000]   and you're all trying to solve the same problem
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   but neuron A over here just deduced something
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:24.160]   based on its inputs and it's now sending that information
[00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:26.480]   across the network to another location
[00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:28.440]   so that would be the act of communication.
[00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:29.880]   - Can you linger on Landauer
[00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:31.840]   and saying information is physical?
[00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:35.360]   - Rolf Landauer, not to be confused with Lev Landau.
[00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:38.000]   Yeah, and he made huge contributions
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   to our understanding of the reversibility of information
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.680]   and this concept that energy has to be dissipated
[00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:50.120]   in computing when the computation is irreversible
[00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:52.120]   but if you can manage to make it reversible
[00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:55.080]   then you don't need to expend energy
[00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:59.680]   but if you do expend energy to perform a computation
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:02.360]   there's sort of a minimal amount that you have to do
[00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:04.480]   and it's KT log two.
[00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:05.920]   - And it's all somehow related
[00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:07.680]   to the second law of thermodynamics
[00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:09.640]   and that the universe is an information process
[00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:11.560]   and then we're living in a simulation.
[00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:12.960]   So, okay, sorry.
[00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:14.680]   Sorry for that tangent.
[00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:17.160]   So that's the defining the distinction
[00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:19.600]   between computation and communication.
[00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:21.960]   - Let me say one more thing just to clarify.
[00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:26.960]   Communication ideally does not change the information.
[00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:28.920]   It moves it from one place to another
[00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:30.960]   but it is preserved.
[00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:32.560]   - Got it, okay.
[00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:33.760]   All right, that is beautiful.
[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:38.640]   So, then the electron versus light distinction
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:42.440]   and why are electrons good at computation
[00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:44.560]   and light good at communication?
[00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:48.860]   - Yes, there's a lot that goes into it I guess
[00:46:48.860 --> 00:46:51.720]   but just try to speak to the simplest part of it.
[00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:57.040]   Electrons interact strongly with one another.
[00:46:57.040 --> 00:46:58.360]   They're charged particles.
[00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:02.040]   So if I pile a bunch of them over here,
[00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:03.880]   they're feeling a certain amount of force
[00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:05.680]   and they wanna move somewhere else.
[00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:06.920]   They're strongly interactive.
[00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:09.560]   You can also get them to sit still.
[00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:10.680]   An electron has a mass
[00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:15.680]   so you can cause it to be spatially localized.
[00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:18.120]   So for computation, that's useful
[00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:20.160]   because now I can make these little devices
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:21.960]   that put a bunch of electrons over here
[00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:25.640]   and then I change the state of a gate
[00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:26.520]   like I've been describing,
[00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:28.400]   put a different voltage on this gate
[00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:30.000]   and now I move the electrons over here.
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:31.240]   Now they're sitting somewhere else.
[00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:34.000]   I have a physical mechanism
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.040]   with which I can represent information.
[00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:38.140]   It's spatially localized and I have knobs
[00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:41.240]   that I can adjust to change where those electrons are
[00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:42.400]   or what they're doing.
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:45.280]   Light by contrast, photons of light,
[00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:48.120]   which are the discrete packets of energy
[00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:50.800]   that were identified by Einstein,
[00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:53.440]   they do not interact with each other
[00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:56.280]   especially at low light levels.
[00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:57.400]   If you're in a medium
[00:47:57.400 --> 00:48:00.400]   and you have a bright, high light level,
[00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:02.560]   you can get them to interact with each other
[00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:05.360]   through the interaction with that medium that they're in
[00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:07.840]   but that's a little bit more exotic
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:10.360]   and for the purposes of this conversation,
[00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:13.240]   we can assume that photons don't interact with each other.
[00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:16.120]   So if you have a bunch of them
[00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:17.620]   all propagating in the same direction,
[00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:19.160]   they don't interfere with each other.
[00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:22.960]   If I wanna send, if I have a communication channel
[00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:24.500]   and I put one more photon on it,
[00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:26.040]   it doesn't screw up with those other ones.
[00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:29.120]   It doesn't change what those other ones were doing at all.
[00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:31.280]   So that's really useful for communication
[00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:33.320]   because that means you can sort of
[00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:35.600]   allow a lot of these photons to flow
[00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:38.840]   without disruption of each other
[00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:41.120]   and they can branch really easily and things like that
[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:42.720]   but it's not good for computation
[00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:46.360]   because it's very hard for this packet of light
[00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:48.720]   to change what this packet of light is doing.
[00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:50.200]   They pass right through each other.
[00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:53.300]   So in computation, you want to change information
[00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:55.720]   and if photons don't interact with each other,
[00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:57.360]   it's difficult to get them to change
[00:48:57.360 --> 00:48:59.400]   the information represented by the others.
[00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:01.440]   - So that's the fundamental difference.
[00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:04.800]   Is there also something about the way they travel
[00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:06.440]   through different materials
[00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:10.720]   or is that just a particular engineering?
[00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:11.560]   - No, it's not.
[00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:12.600]   That's deep physics, I think.
[00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:17.080]   So this gets back to electrons interact with each other
[00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:18.160]   and photons don't.
[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:22.440]   So say I'm trying to get a packet of information
[00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:25.840]   from me to you and we have a wire going between us.
[00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:29.040]   In order for me to send electrons across that wire,
[00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:32.240]   I first have to raise the voltage on my end of the wire
[00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:34.640]   and that means putting a bunch of charges on it
[00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:39.180]   and then that charge packet has to propagate along the wire
[00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:41.280]   and it has to get all the way over to you.
[00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:44.380]   That wire is gonna have something that's called capacitance
[00:49:44.380 --> 00:49:46.960]   which basically tells you how much charge
[00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:48.080]   you need to put on the wire
[00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:49.960]   in order to raise the voltage on it
[00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:52.520]   and the capacitance is gonna be proportional
[00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:54.040]   to the length of the wire.
[00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:56.880]   So the longer the length of the wire is,
[00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:59.120]   the more charge I have to put on it
[00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:03.080]   and the energy required to charge up that line
[00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:04.960]   and move those electrons to you
[00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:06.840]   is also proportional to the capacitance
[00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:08.520]   and goes as the voltage squared.
[00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:10.560]   So you get this huge penalty
[00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:15.040]   if you wanna send electrons across a wire
[00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:16.600]   over appreciable distances.
[00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:19.120]   - So distance is an important thing here
[00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:20.800]   when you're doing communication.
[00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:22.120]   - Distance is an important thing,
[00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:25.360]   so is the number of connections I'm trying to make.
[00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:27.640]   Me to you, okay, one, that's not so bad.
[00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:31.440]   If I want to now send it to 10,000 other friends,
[00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:33.360]   then all of those wires
[00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:35.480]   are adding tons of extra capacitance.
[00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:37.680]   Now, not only does it take forever
[00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:39.560]   to put the charge on that wire
[00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:41.840]   and raise the voltage on all those lines,
[00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:43.560]   but it takes a ton of power
[00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:47.000]   and the number 10,000 is not randomly chosen,
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.120]   that's roughly how many connections
[00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:50.640]   each neuron in your brain makes.
[00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:55.040]   So a neuron in your brain needs to send 10,000 messages
[00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:56.780]   every time it has something to say.
[00:50:56.780 --> 00:51:00.120]   You can't do that if you're trying to drive electrons
[00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:02.080]   from here to 10,000 different places.
[00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:03.680]   The brain does it in a slightly different way,
[00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:04.880]   which we can discuss.
[00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:07.040]   - How can light achieve the 10,000 connections
[00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:12.000]   and why is it better in terms of the energy use
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.240]   required to use light for the communication
[00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:15.280]   of the 10,000 connections?
[00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:16.800]   - Right, right, so now instead of trying
[00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:18.200]   to send electrons from me to you,
[00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:19.360]   I'm trying to send photons.
[00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:21.520]   So I can make what's called a waveguide,
[00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:25.120]   which is just a simple piece of material.
[00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:27.060]   It could be glass, like an optical fiber
[00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:29.880]   or silicon on a chip.
[00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:34.160]   And I just have to inject photons into that waveguide
[00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:35.800]   and independent of how long it is,
[00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:39.640]   independent of how many different connections I'm making,
[00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:43.120]   it doesn't change the voltage or anything like that
[00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:45.480]   that I have to raise up on the wire.
[00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:47.920]   So if I have one more connection,
[00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:49.820]   if I add additional connections,
[00:51:49.820 --> 00:51:51.760]   I need to add more light to the waveguide
[00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:53.280]   because those photons need to split
[00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:55.040]   and go to different paths.
[00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:58.840]   That makes sense, but I don't have a capacitive penalty.
[00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:01.280]   Sometimes these are called wiring parasitics.
[00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:03.440]   There are no parasitics associated with light
[00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:05.120]   in that same sense.
[00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:07.480]   - Well, this might be a dumb question,
[00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:11.360]   but how do I catch a photon on the other end?
[00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:14.080]   Is it material, is it the polymer stuff
[00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:17.240]   you were talking about for a different application
[00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:19.520]   for photolithography?
[00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:21.000]   How do you catch a photon?
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:22.520]   - There's a lot of ways to catch a photon.
[00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:23.600]   It's not a dumb question.
[00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:25.940]   It's a deep and important question
[00:52:25.940 --> 00:52:29.180]   that basically defines a lot of the work
[00:52:29.180 --> 00:52:31.360]   that goes on in our group at NIST.
[00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:34.280]   One of my group leaders, Seywounam,
[00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:37.100]   has built his career around these superconducting
[00:52:37.100 --> 00:52:38.400]   single photon detectors.
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:42.440]   So if you're going to try to sort of reach a lower limit
[00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:45.240]   and detect just one particle of light,
[00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:47.660]   superconductors come back into our conversation.
[00:52:47.660 --> 00:52:50.140]   And just picture a simple device
[00:52:50.140 --> 00:52:51.600]   where you have current flowing
[00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:54.600]   through a superconducting wire and--
[00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:56.560]   - A loop again or no?
[00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:57.800]   - Let's say, yes, you have a loop.
[00:52:57.800 --> 00:52:59.560]   So you have a superconducting wire
[00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:01.000]   that goes straight down like this.
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:04.240]   And on your loop branch, you have a little ammeter,
[00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:05.800]   something that measures current.
[00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:07.960]   There's a resistor up there too.
[00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:09.000]   Go with me here.
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:12.000]   So you're current biasing this,
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:13.060]   so there's current flowing
[00:53:13.060 --> 00:53:14.400]   through that superconducting branch.
[00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:16.560]   Since there's a resistor over here,
[00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:18.920]   all the current goes through the superconducting branch.
[00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:22.280]   Now a photon comes in, strikes that superconductor.
[00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:24.280]   We talked about this superconducting
[00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:25.760]   macroscopic quantum state.
[00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:28.480]   That's going to be destroyed by the energy of that photon.
[00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:32.080]   So now that branch of the circuit is resistive too.
[00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:33.760]   And you've properly designed your circuit
[00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:36.680]   so that the resistance on that superconducting branch
[00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:38.400]   is much greater than the other resistance.
[00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:40.760]   Now, all of your current's going to go that way.
[00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:43.240]   Your ammeter says, oh, I just got a pulse of current.
[00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:45.120]   That must mean I detected a photon.
[00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:47.200]   Then where you broke that superconductivity
[00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:49.080]   in a matter of a few nanoseconds,
[00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:51.080]   it cools back off, dissipates that energy,
[00:53:51.080 --> 00:53:52.800]   and the current flows back
[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:54.280]   through that superconducting branch.
[00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:59.200]   This is a very powerful superconducting device
[00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:02.280]   that allows us to understand quantum states of light.
[00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:04.880]   - I didn't realize a loop like that
[00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:07.160]   could be sensitive to a single photon.
[00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:12.000]   I mean, that seems strange to me because,
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:16.600]   I mean, so what happens when you just barrage it with photons?
[00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:18.360]   - If you put a bunch of photons in there,
[00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:19.880]   essentially the same thing happens.
[00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:21.680]   You just drive it into the normal state.
[00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:23.160]   It becomes resistive,
[00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:25.400]   and it's not particularly interesting.
[00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:28.000]   - So you have to be careful how many photons you send.
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:30.120]   Like you have to be very precise with your communication.
[00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:31.240]   - Well, it depends.
[00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:32.920]   So I would say that that's actually,
[00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:34.840]   in the application that we're trying
[00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:37.960]   to use these detectors for, that's a feature.
[00:54:37.960 --> 00:54:39.880]   Because what we want is for,
[00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:46.120]   if a neuron sends one photon to a synaptic connection,
[00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:49.840]   and one of these superconducting detectors is sitting there,
[00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:51.200]   you get this pulse of current,
[00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:54.000]   and that synapse says, "Event,"
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.040]   then I'm gonna do what I do when there's a synapse event,
[00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:58.640]   I'm gonna perform computations, that kind of thing.
[00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:02.120]   But if accidentally you send two there, or three, or five,
[00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:03.360]   it does the exact same.
[00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:04.200]   - Got it.
[00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:09.200]   - And so this is how, in the system that we're devising here,
[00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:12.760]   communication is entirely binary.
[00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:15.040]   And that's what I tried to emphasize a second ago.
[00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:17.800]   Communication should not change the information.
[00:55:17.800 --> 00:55:20.600]   You're not saying, "Oh, I got this kind
[00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:22.280]   "of communication event for photons."
[00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:23.720]   No, we're not keeping track of that.
[00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:25.720]   This neuron fired, this synapse says,
[00:55:25.720 --> 00:55:27.040]   "That neuron fired, that's it."
[00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:31.480]   So that's a noise filtering property of those detectors.
[00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:33.120]   However, there are other applications
[00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:36.120]   where you'd rather know the exact number of photons.
[00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:39.320]   That can be very useful in quantum computing with light.
[00:55:39.320 --> 00:55:41.800]   And our group does a lot of work
[00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:44.560]   around another kind of superconducting sensor
[00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:46.640]   called a transition edge sensor
[00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:49.920]   that Adrian Alita in our group does a lot of work on that.
[00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:52.560]   And that can tell you,
[00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:55.760]   based on the amplitude of the current pulse you divert,
[00:55:55.760 --> 00:55:59.760]   exactly how many photons were in that pulse.
[00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:02.480]   - What's that useful for?
[00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:04.700]   - One way that you can encode information
[00:56:04.700 --> 00:56:07.440]   in quantum states of light is in the number of photons.
[00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:09.320]   You can have what are called number states.
[00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:11.960]   And a number state will have a well-defined number
[00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:14.400]   of photons, and maybe the output
[00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:18.760]   of your quantum computation encodes its information
[00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:20.460]   in the number of photons that are generated.
[00:56:20.460 --> 00:56:23.040]   So if you have a detector that is sensitive to that,
[00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:24.280]   it's extremely useful.
[00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:29.240]   - Can you achieve like a clock with photons?
[00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:30.240]   Or is that not important?
[00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:32.440]   Is there a synchronicity here?
[00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:35.360]   - In general, it can be important.
[00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:39.380]   Clock distribution is a big challenge
[00:56:39.380 --> 00:56:43.280]   in especially large computational systems.
[00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:47.960]   And so yes, optical clocks, optical clock distribution
[00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:51.140]   is a very powerful technology.
[00:56:51.140 --> 00:56:53.180]   I don't know the state of that field right now,
[00:56:53.180 --> 00:56:55.620]   but I imagine that if you're trying to distribute a clock
[00:56:55.620 --> 00:56:58.960]   across any appreciable size computational system,
[00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:00.360]   you wanna use light.
[00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:04.280]   - Yeah, I wonder how these giant systems work,
[00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:07.360]   especially like supercomputers.
[00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:09.360]   Do they need to do clock distribution
[00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:14.240]   or are they doing more ad hoc parallel,
[00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:15.520]   like concurrent programming?
[00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:18.120]   Like there's some kind of locking mechanisms or something.
[00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:19.280]   - That's a fascinating question.
[00:57:20.060 --> 00:57:23.860]   Let's zoom in at this very particular question
[00:57:23.860 --> 00:57:28.180]   of computation on a processor
[00:57:28.180 --> 00:57:31.520]   and communication between processors.
[00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:36.420]   So what does this system look like
[00:57:36.420 --> 00:57:38.180]   that you're envisioning?
[00:57:38.180 --> 00:57:40.060]   One of the places you're envisioning it
[00:57:40.060 --> 00:57:43.100]   is in the paper on optoelectronic intelligence.
[00:57:43.100 --> 00:57:44.700]   So what are we talking about?
[00:57:44.700 --> 00:57:47.300]   Are we talking about something that starts to look a lot
[00:57:47.300 --> 00:57:50.160]   like the human brain or does it still look a lot
[00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:51.260]   like a computer?
[00:57:51.260 --> 00:57:52.920]   What are the size of this thing?
[00:57:52.920 --> 00:57:54.380]   Is it going inside a smartphone?
[00:57:54.380 --> 00:57:56.360]   Or as you said, does it go inside something
[00:57:56.360 --> 00:57:58.540]   that's more like a house?
[00:57:58.540 --> 00:58:01.140]   Like what should we be imagining?
[00:58:01.140 --> 00:58:02.660]   What are you thinking about when you're thinking
[00:58:02.660 --> 00:58:05.420]   about these fundamental systems?
[00:58:05.420 --> 00:58:07.340]   - Let me introduce the word neuromorphic.
[00:58:07.340 --> 00:58:09.900]   There's this concept of neuromorphic computing
[00:58:09.900 --> 00:58:13.900]   where what that broadly refers to is computing
[00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:19.220]   based on the information processing principles of the brain.
[00:58:19.220 --> 00:58:23.780]   And as digital computing seems to be pushing
[00:58:23.780 --> 00:58:26.440]   towards some fundamental performance limits,
[00:58:26.440 --> 00:58:29.140]   people are considering architectural advances,
[00:58:29.140 --> 00:58:30.840]   drawing inspiration from the brain,
[00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:34.200]   more distributed parallel network architectures and stuff.
[00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:37.420]   And so there's this continuum of neuromorphic
[00:58:37.420 --> 00:58:42.420]   from things that are pretty similar to digital computers,
[00:58:42.740 --> 00:58:45.720]   but maybe there are more cores
[00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:49.160]   and the way they send messages is a little bit more
[00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:52.780]   like the way brain neurons send spikes.
[00:58:52.780 --> 00:58:56.080]   But for the most part, it's still digital electronics.
[00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:58.700]   And then you have some things in between
[00:58:58.700 --> 00:59:02.060]   where maybe you're using transistors,
[00:59:02.060 --> 00:59:03.220]   but now you're starting to use them
[00:59:03.220 --> 00:59:06.240]   instead of in a digital way, in an analog way.
[00:59:06.240 --> 00:59:08.140]   And so you're trying to get those circuits
[00:59:08.140 --> 00:59:10.300]   to behave more like neurons.
[00:59:10.300 --> 00:59:12.100]   And then that's a little bit,
[00:59:12.100 --> 00:59:14.920]   quite a bit more on the neuromorphic side of things.
[00:59:14.920 --> 00:59:17.060]   You're trying to get your circuits,
[00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:19.120]   although they're still based on silicon,
[00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:22.460]   you're trying to get them to perform operations
[00:59:22.460 --> 00:59:24.660]   that are highly analogous to the operations in the brain.
[00:59:24.660 --> 00:59:26.680]   That's where a great deal of work is
[00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:29.160]   in neuromorphic computing, people like Yakima Wendoveri
[00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:32.940]   and Gert Kauenberg, Jennifer Hasler, countless others.
[00:59:32.940 --> 00:59:35.540]   It's a rich and exciting field
[00:59:35.540 --> 00:59:39.440]   going back to Carver Mead in the late 1980s.
[00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:44.220]   And then all the way on the other extreme of the continuum
[00:59:44.220 --> 00:59:48.540]   is where you say, I'll give up anything related
[00:59:48.540 --> 00:59:51.380]   to transistors or semiconductors or anything like that.
[00:59:51.380 --> 00:59:53.580]   I'm not starting with the assumption
[00:59:53.580 --> 00:59:55.020]   that I'm gonna use any kind
[00:59:55.020 --> 00:59:57.220]   of conventional computing hardware.
[00:59:57.220 --> 00:59:59.260]   And instead, what I wanna do is try and understand
[00:59:59.260 --> 01:00:00.660]   what makes the brain powerful
[01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:03.300]   at the kind of information processing it does.
[01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:05.500]   And I wanna think from first principles
[01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:10.500]   about what hardware is best going to enable us
[01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:13.980]   to capture those information processing principles
[01:00:13.980 --> 01:00:15.980]   in an artificial system.
[01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:17.380]   And that's where I live.
[01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:21.700]   That's where I'm doing my exploration these days.
[01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:25.780]   - So what are the first principles
[01:00:25.780 --> 01:00:29.920]   of brain-like computation and communication?
[01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:32.560]   - Right, yeah, this is so important.
[01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:34.460]   And I'm glad we booked 14 hours for this
[01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:37.240]   because-- - I only have 13, I'm sorry.
[01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:38.360]   (laughing)
[01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:41.480]   - Okay, so the brain is notoriously complicated.
[01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:44.040]   And I think that's an important part
[01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:46.300]   of why it can do what it does.
[01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:48.680]   But okay, let me try to break it down.
[01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:54.620]   Starting with the devices, neurons, as I said before,
[01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:57.080]   they're sophisticated devices in and of themselves.
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:58.220]   And synapses are too.
[01:00:58.220 --> 01:01:03.040]   They can change their state based on the activity.
[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:04.880]   So they adapt over time.
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:07.000]   That's crucial to the way the brain works.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.360]   They don't just adapt on one time scale.
[01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:12.440]   They can adapt on myriad timescales
[01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:16.080]   from the spacing between pulses,
[01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:18.720]   the spacing between spikes that come from neurons,
[01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:21.540]   all the way to the age of the organism.
[01:01:21.540 --> 01:01:28.100]   Also relevant, perhaps, I think the most important thing
[01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:32.320]   that's guided my thinking is the network structure
[01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:33.880]   of the brain.
[01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:36.560]   - Which can also be adjusted on different scales.
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:37.400]   - Absolutely, yeah.
[01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:41.360]   So you're changing the strength of contacts,
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:44.120]   you're changing the spatial distribution of them,
[01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:46.880]   although spatial distribution doesn't change that much
[01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:49.400]   once you're a mature organism.
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:52.880]   But that network structure is really crucial.
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:55.380]   So let me dwell on that for a second.
[01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:58.960]   You can't talk about the brain without emphasizing
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:02.880]   that most of the neurons in the neocortex
[01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:04.840]   or the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain
[01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:08.080]   that we think is most responsible for high-level reasoning
[01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:09.080]   and things like that,
[01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:11.400]   those neurons make thousands of connections.
[01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:15.560]   So you have this network that is highly interconnected.
[01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:19.880]   And I think it's safe to say that one of the primary reasons
[01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:23.200]   that they make so many different connections
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:26.880]   is that allows information to be communicated very rapidly
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:29.240]   from any spot in the network to any other spot
[01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:30.320]   in the network.
[01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:33.920]   So that's a sort of spatial aspect of it.
[01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:38.480]   You can quantify this in terms of concepts
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:41.020]   that are related to fractals and scale invariance,
[01:02:41.020 --> 01:02:43.260]   which I think is a very beautiful concept.
[01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:46.720]   So what I mean by that is kind of no matter
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:50.720]   what spatial scale you're looking at in the brain
[01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:52.320]   within certain bounds,
[01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:54.960]   you see the same general statistical pattern.
[01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:59.280]   So if I draw a box around some region of my cortex,
[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:02.280]   most of the connections that those neurons
[01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:04.480]   within that box make are gonna be within the box
[01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:06.200]   to each other in their local neighborhood.
[01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:09.280]   And that's sort of called clustering, loosely speaking.
[01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:10.920]   But a non-negligible fraction
[01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:12.600]   is gonna go outside of that box.
[01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:14.060]   And then if I draw a bigger box,
[01:03:14.060 --> 01:03:16.400]   the pattern is gonna be exactly the same.
[01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:18.400]   So you have this scale invariance
[01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:22.680]   and you also have a non-vanishing probability
[01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:25.360]   of a neuron making connection very far away.
[01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:28.680]   So suppose you wanna plot the probability
[01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:32.400]   of a neuron making a connection as a function of distance.
[01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:34.200]   If that were an exponential function,
[01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:36.680]   it would go e to the minus radius
[01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:38.660]   over some characteristic radius,
[01:03:38.660 --> 01:03:41.820]   and it would drop off up to some certain radius.
[01:03:41.820 --> 01:03:44.880]   The probability would be reasonable close to one.
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:49.120]   And then beyond that characteristic length, R zero,
[01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:51.280]   it would drop off sharply.
[01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:53.560]   And so that would mean that the neurons in your brain
[01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:58.560]   are really localized, and that's not what we observe.
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:00.680]   Instead, what you see is that the probability
[01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:02.700]   of making a longer distance connection,
[01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:05.760]   it does drop off, but it drops off as a power law.
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:08.400]   So the probability that you're gonna have a connection
[01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:13.160]   at some radius R goes as R to the minus some power.
[01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:16.800]   And that's what we see with forces in nature,
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:18.440]   like the electromagnetic force
[01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:20.440]   between two particles or gravity
[01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:22.960]   goes as one over the radius squared.
[01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:24.400]   - You can see this in fractals.
[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:28.600]   I love that there's a fractal dynamics of the brain
[01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:31.440]   that if you zoom out, you draw the box,
[01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:35.020]   and you increase that box by certain step sizes,
[01:04:35.020 --> 01:04:36.720]   you're gonna see the same statistics.
[01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:39.960]   - I think that's probably very important
[01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:41.840]   to the way the brain processes information.
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:43.560]   It's not just in the spatial domain,
[01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:45.600]   it's also in the temporal domain.
[01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:47.080]   And what I mean by that is-
[01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:48.600]   (imitates explosion)
[01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:50.600]   - That's incredible that this emerged
[01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:52.320]   through the evolutionary process
[01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:54.880]   that potentially somehow connected
[01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:57.800]   to the way the physics of the universe works.
[01:04:57.800 --> 01:04:59.320]   - Yeah, I couldn't agree more.
[01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:01.400]   That it's a deep and fascinating subject
[01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:04.160]   that I hope to be able to spend the rest of my life studying.
[01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:07.280]   - You think you need to solve, understand this,
[01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:09.480]   this fractal nature in order to understand
[01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:10.720]   intelligence and communication.
[01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:11.560]   - I do think so.
[01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:13.320]   I think they're deeply intertwined.
[01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:16.880]   Yes, I think power laws are right at the heart of it.
[01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:19.400]   So just to push that one through,
[01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:21.480]   the same thing happens in the temporal domain.
[01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:23.080]   So suppose you had,
[01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:26.000]   suppose your neurons in your brain
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.160]   were always oscillating at the same frequency.
[01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:30.760]   Then the probability of finding a neuron
[01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:32.520]   oscillating as a function of frequency
[01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:34.520]   would be this narrowly peaked function
[01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:36.520]   around that certain characteristic frequency.
[01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:37.880]   That's not at all what we see.
[01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:40.240]   The probability of finding neurons oscillating
[01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:43.880]   or pulsing, producing spikes at a certain frequency
[01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:45.200]   is again a power law,
[01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:49.640]   which means there's no defined scale
[01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:51.680]   of the temporal activity in the brain.
[01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:56.040]   At what speed do your thoughts occur?
[01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:58.280]   Well, there's a fastest speed they can occur
[01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:01.520]   and that is limited by communication and other things.
[01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:03.960]   But there's not a characteristic scale.
[01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:06.880]   We have thoughts on all temporal scales
[01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:10.840]   from a few tens of milliseconds,
[01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:13.400]   which is physiologically limited by our devices.
[01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:15.760]   Compare that to tens of picoseconds
[01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:17.160]   that I talked about in superconductors,
[01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:19.280]   all the way up to the lifetime of the organism.
[01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:20.760]   You can still think about things
[01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:22.600]   that happened to you when you were a kid.
[01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:24.080]   - Or if you wanna be really trippy,
[01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:25.880]   then across multiple organisms
[01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:27.480]   in the entirety of human civilization,
[01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:29.440]   you have thoughts that span organisms, right?
[01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:31.280]   - Yes, taking it to that level, yes.
[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:33.680]   - If you're willing to see the entirety
[01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:35.720]   of the human species as a single organism
[01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:37.200]   with a collective intelligence,
[01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:39.920]   then that too on a spatial and temporal scale,
[01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:41.120]   there's thoughts occurring.
[01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:44.040]   And then if you look at not just the human species,
[01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:46.480]   but the entirety of life on earth
[01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:49.640]   as an organism with thoughts that are occurring,
[01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:51.640]   that are greater and greater sophisticated thoughts,
[01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:54.680]   there's a different spatial and temporal scale there.
[01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:57.240]   This is getting very suspicious.
[01:06:57.240 --> 01:06:58.120]   - Well, hold on though.
[01:06:58.120 --> 01:07:01.000]   Before we're done, I just wanna just tie the bow
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:04.320]   and say that the spatial and temporal aspects
[01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:06.480]   are intimately interrelated with each other.
[01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:09.120]   So activity between neurons
[01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:10.360]   that are very close to each other
[01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:13.600]   is more likely to happen on this faster timescale
[01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:15.320]   and information is gonna propagate
[01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:17.200]   and encompass more of the brain,
[01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:20.320]   more of your cortices, different modules in the brain
[01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:23.760]   are gonna be engaged in information processing
[01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:25.320]   on longer timescales.
[01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:27.960]   So there's this concept of information integration
[01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:31.960]   where most neurons are specialized.
[01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:34.000]   Any given neuron or any cluster of neuron
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.760]   has its specific purpose,
[01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:39.920]   but they're also very much integrated.
[01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:41.920]   So you have neurons that specialize,
[01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:43.680]   but share their information.
[01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:47.600]   And so that happens through these fractal nested oscillations
[01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:49.440]   that occur across spatial and temporal scales.
[01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:53.680]   I think capturing those dynamics in hardware,
[01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:57.080]   to me, that's the goal of neuromorphic computing.
[01:07:57.080 --> 01:07:58.720]   - So does it need to look,
[01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:00.840]   so first of all, that's fascinating.
[01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:03.960]   We've stated some clear principles here.
[01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:08.120]   Now, does it have to look like the brain
[01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:09.800]   outside of those principles as well?
[01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:11.320]   Like what other characteristics
[01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:13.080]   have to look like the human brain?
[01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:15.840]   Or can it be something very different?
[01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:18.000]   - Well, it depends on what you're trying to use it for.
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.760]   And so I think a lot of the community
[01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:23.080]   asks that question a lot.
[01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:24.360]   What are you gonna do with it?
[01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:26.600]   And I completely get it.
[01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:28.040]   I think that's a very important question.
[01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:31.840]   And it's also sometimes not the most helpful question.
[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:33.760]   What if what you wanna do with it is study it?
[01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:35.120]   What if you just wanna see,
[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:39.240]   what do you have to build into your hardware
[01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:41.880]   in order to observe these dynamical principles?
[01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:47.520]   - And also, I ask myself that question every day,
[01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:49.840]   and I'm not sure I'm able to answer that.
[01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:51.200]   It's like, what are you gonna do
[01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:53.480]   with this particular neuromorphic machine?
[01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:55.320]   - So suppose what we're trying to do with it
[01:08:55.320 --> 01:08:56.960]   is build something that thinks.
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:59.120]   We're not trying to get it to make us any money
[01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:00.200]   or drive a car.
[01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:02.600]   Maybe we'll be able to do that, but that's not our goal.
[01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:06.240]   Our goal is to see if we can get the same types
[01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:08.880]   of behaviors that we observe in our own brain.
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:10.440]   And by behaviors, in this sense,
[01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:14.280]   what I mean, the behaviors of the components,
[01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:15.960]   the neurons, the network, that kind of stuff.
[01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:19.080]   I think there's another element that I didn't really hit on
[01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:21.160]   that you also have to build into this,
[01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:22.920]   and those are architectural principles.
[01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:26.640]   They have to do with the hierarchical modular construction
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:27.480]   of the network.
[01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:30.200]   And without getting too lost in jargon,
[01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:33.680]   the main point that I think is relevant there,
[01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:35.720]   let me try and illustrate it with a cartoon picture
[01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:38.200]   of the architecture of the brain.
[01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:41.080]   So in the brain, you have the cortex,
[01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:43.520]   which is sort of this outer sheet.
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:47.280]   It's actually, it's a layered structure.
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:48.440]   If you could take it out of your brain,
[01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:50.640]   you could unroll it on the table,
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:53.500]   and it would be about the size of a pizza sitting there.
[01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:57.240]   And that's a module.
[01:09:57.240 --> 01:09:58.640]   It does certain things.
[01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:01.640]   It processes, as Yorgi Buzsaki would say,
[01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:04.440]   it processes the what of what's going on around you.
[01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:07.120]   But you have another really crucial module
[01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:08.920]   that's called the hippocampus,
[01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:11.400]   and that network is structured entirely differently.
[01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:13.740]   First of all, this cortex that I described,
[01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:17.760]   10 billion neurons in there, so numbers matter here.
[01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:21.320]   And they're organized in that sort of power law distribution
[01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:23.140]   where the probability of making a connection
[01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:25.240]   drops off as a power law in space.
[01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:26.880]   The hippocampus is another module
[01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:30.160]   that's important for understanding how,
[01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:32.920]   where you are, when you are,
[01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:37.960]   keeping track of your position in space and time.
[01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:39.960]   And that network is very much random.
[01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:42.080]   So the probability of making a connection,
[01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:45.500]   it almost doesn't even drop off as a function of distance.
[01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:46.600]   It's the same probability
[01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:48.420]   that you'll make it here to over there.
[01:10:48.420 --> 01:10:51.440]   But there are only about 100 million neurons there.
[01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:55.120]   So you can have that huge, densely connected module
[01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:57.720]   because it's not so big.
[01:10:57.720 --> 01:11:02.480]   And the neocortex, or the cortex and the hippocampus,
[01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:05.360]   they talk to each other constantly.
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:08.340]   And that communication is largely facilitated
[01:11:08.340 --> 01:11:10.160]   by what's called the thalamus.
[01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:11.320]   I'm not a neuroscientist here.
[01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:13.520]   I'm trying to do my best to recite things.
[01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:15.120]   - Cartoon picture of the brain, I got you.
[01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:16.020]   - Yeah, something like that.
[01:11:16.020 --> 01:11:19.080]   So this thalamus is coordinating the activity
[01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:21.160]   between the neocortex and the hippocampus
[01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:24.000]   and making sure that they talk to each other
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:25.720]   at the right time and send messages
[01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:27.260]   that will be useful to one another.
[01:11:27.260 --> 01:11:29.080]   So this all taken together
[01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:32.040]   is called the thalamocortical complex.
[01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:35.320]   And it seems like building something like that
[01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:37.720]   is going to be crucial to capturing
[01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:40.540]   the types of activity we're looking for
[01:11:40.540 --> 01:11:45.280]   because those responsibilities, those separate modules,
[01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:46.160]   they do different things.
[01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:51.160]   That's gotta be central to achieving these states
[01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:55.260]   of efficient information integration across space and time.
[01:11:55.260 --> 01:11:59.400]   - By the way, I am able to achieve this state
[01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:02.280]   by watching simulations, visualizations
[01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:04.240]   of the thalamocortical complex.
[01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:06.920]   There's a few people, I forget from where,
[01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:10.360]   they've created these incredible visual illustrations
[01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:15.360]   of visual stimulation from the eye or something like that
[01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:18.520]   in this image flowing through the brain.
[01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:20.040]   - Wow, I haven't seen that.
[01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:20.880]   I gotta check that out.
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:22.120]   - So it's one of those things,
[01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:24.280]   you find this stuff in the world
[01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:27.080]   and you see on YouTube, it has 1,000 views,
[01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:30.760]   these visualizations of the human brain
[01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:32.140]   processing information.
[01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:36.440]   'Cause there's chemistry there
[01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:38.880]   because this is from actual human brains.
[01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:40.720]   I don't know how they're doing the coloring
[01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:42.600]   but they're able to actually trace
[01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:46.680]   the chemical and the electrical signals
[01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:48.880]   throughout the brain and the visual thing.
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:51.800]   It's like, whoa, because it looks kind of like the universe.
[01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:53.800]   I mean, the whole thing is just incredible.
[01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:55.080]   I recommend it highly.
[01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:56.640]   I'll probably post a link to it.
[01:12:56.640 --> 01:12:58.120]   But you can just look for,
[01:12:58.120 --> 01:13:00.960]   one of the things they simulate
[01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:05.840]   is the thalamocortical complex and just visualization.
[01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:09.520]   You can find that yourself on YouTube, but it's beautiful.
[01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:11.320]   The other question I have for you is
[01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:14.440]   how does memory play into all of this?
[01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:17.120]   Because all the signals sending back and forth,
[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:20.880]   that's computation and communication,
[01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:25.880]   but that's kind of like processing of inputs and outputs
[01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:27.560]   to produce outputs in the system.
[01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:29.000]   That's kind of like maybe reasoning,
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.920]   maybe there's some kind of recurrence.
[01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:33.920]   But is there a storage mechanism that you think about
[01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:35.840]   in the context of neuromorphic computing?
[01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:36.680]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:37.760]   So that's gotta be central.
[01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:41.520]   You have to have a way that you can store memories.
[01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:44.720]   And there are a lot of different kinds of memory
[01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:45.560]   in the brain.
[01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:49.160]   That's yet another example of how it's not a simple system.
[01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:53.000]   So there's one kind of memory,
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.860]   one way of talking about memory.
[01:13:56.040 --> 01:13:59.040]   Usually starts in the context of Hopfield networks.
[01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:02.440]   You were lucky to talk to John Hopfield on this program.
[01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:05.840]   But the basic idea there is working memory
[01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:07.800]   is stored in the dynamical patterns
[01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:10.360]   of activity between neurons.
[01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:14.720]   And you can think of a certain pattern of activity
[01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:19.640]   as an attractor, meaning if you put in some signal
[01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:24.000]   that's similar enough to other previously experienced
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:27.760]   signals like that, then you're going to converge
[01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:31.720]   to the same network dynamics and you will see these neurons
[01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:36.200]   participate in the same network patterns of activity
[01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:37.600]   that they have in the past.
[01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:41.260]   So you can talk about the probability that different inputs
[01:14:41.260 --> 01:14:44.240]   will allow you to converge to different basins of attraction
[01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:48.000]   and you might think of that as, oh, I saw this face
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.920]   and then I excited this network pattern of activity
[01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:53.080]   because last time I saw that face,
[01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:56.960]   I was at some movie and that's a famous person
[01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:58.120]   that's on the screen or something like that.
[01:14:58.120 --> 01:15:00.560]   So that's one memory storage mechanism,
[01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:04.420]   but crucial to the ability to imprint those memories
[01:15:04.420 --> 01:15:08.560]   in your brain is the ability to change the strength
[01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:11.380]   of connection between one neuron and another,
[01:15:11.380 --> 01:15:13.300]   that synaptic connection between them.
[01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:16.620]   So synaptic weight update is a massive field
[01:15:16.620 --> 01:15:19.580]   of neuroscience and neuromorphic computing as well.
[01:15:19.580 --> 01:15:24.580]   So there are two poles to that on that spectrum.
[01:15:24.580 --> 01:15:28.900]   Okay, so more in the language of machine learning,
[01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:32.020]   we would talk about supervised and unsupervised learning.
[01:15:32.020 --> 01:15:33.980]   And when I'm trying to tie that down
[01:15:33.980 --> 01:15:37.040]   to neuromorphic computing, I will use a definition
[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:40.660]   of supervised learning, which basically means
[01:15:40.660 --> 01:15:44.140]   the external user, the person who's controlling
[01:15:44.140 --> 01:15:48.380]   this hardware has some knob that they can tune
[01:15:48.380 --> 01:15:50.420]   to change each of the synaptic weights,
[01:15:50.420 --> 01:15:52.460]   depending on whether or not the network's doing
[01:15:52.460 --> 01:15:53.580]   what you want it to do.
[01:15:53.580 --> 01:15:56.140]   Whereas what I mean in this conversation,
[01:15:56.140 --> 01:15:58.380]   when I say unsupervised learning is that
[01:15:58.380 --> 01:16:02.340]   those synaptic weights are dynamically changing
[01:16:02.340 --> 01:16:05.040]   in your network based on nothing that the user's doing,
[01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:07.100]   nothing that there's no wire from the outside
[01:16:07.100 --> 01:16:09.080]   going into any of those synapses.
[01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:12.100]   The network itself is reconfiguring those synaptic weights
[01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:15.780]   based on physical properties
[01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:17.640]   that you've built into the devices.
[01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:21.420]   So if the synapse receives a pulse from here
[01:16:21.420 --> 01:16:23.400]   and that causes the neuron to spike,
[01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:26.700]   some circuit built in there with no help
[01:16:26.700 --> 01:16:29.220]   from me or anybody else, adjust the weight
[01:16:29.220 --> 01:16:33.580]   in a way that makes it more likely to store
[01:16:33.580 --> 01:16:35.020]   the useful information and excite
[01:16:35.020 --> 01:16:37.720]   the useful network patterns and makes it less likely
[01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:41.460]   that random noise, useless communication events
[01:16:41.460 --> 01:16:45.340]   will have an important effect on the network activity.
[01:16:45.340 --> 01:16:48.280]   - So there's memory encoded in the weights,
[01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:49.600]   the synaptic weights.
[01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:50.940]   - Yes. - What about the formation
[01:16:50.940 --> 01:16:53.680]   of something that's not often done in machine learning,
[01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:56.320]   the formation of new synaptic connections?
[01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:58.200]   - Right, well, that seems to, so again,
[01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:00.160]   not a neuroscientist here,
[01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:02.200]   but my reading of the literature is that
[01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:05.000]   that's particularly crucial in early stages
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:09.160]   of brain development, where a newborn is born
[01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:11.680]   with tons of extra synaptic connections
[01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:13.880]   and it's actually pruned over time.
[01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:16.820]   So the number of synapses decreases
[01:17:16.820 --> 01:17:19.700]   as opposed to growing new long distance connections.
[01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:22.300]   It is possible in the brain to grow new neurons
[01:17:22.300 --> 01:17:26.100]   and assign new synaptic connections,
[01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:29.140]   but it doesn't seem to be the primary mechanism
[01:17:29.140 --> 01:17:31.820]   by which the brain is learning.
[01:17:31.820 --> 01:17:34.260]   So for example, like right now,
[01:17:34.260 --> 01:17:35.740]   sitting here talking to you,
[01:17:35.740 --> 01:17:37.020]   you say lots of interesting things
[01:17:37.020 --> 01:17:40.500]   and I learn from you and I can remember things
[01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:41.340]   that you just said.
[01:17:41.340 --> 01:17:44.720]   And I didn't grow new axonal connections
[01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:47.380]   down to new synapses to enable those.
[01:17:47.380 --> 01:17:52.180]   It's plasticity mechanisms in the synaptic connections
[01:17:52.180 --> 01:17:55.980]   between neurons that enable me to learn on that time scale.
[01:17:55.980 --> 01:17:57.540]   - So at the very least,
[01:17:57.540 --> 01:17:59.860]   you can sufficiently approximate that
[01:17:59.860 --> 01:18:01.360]   with just weight updates.
[01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:02.980]   You don't need to form new connections.
[01:18:02.980 --> 01:18:05.060]   - I would say weight updates are a big part of it.
[01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:08.620]   I also think there's more because broadly speaking,
[01:18:08.620 --> 01:18:10.440]   when we're doing machine learning,
[01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:12.500]   our networks, say we're talking about feed forward,
[01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:14.140]   deep neural networks,
[01:18:14.140 --> 01:18:16.940]   the temporal domain is not really part of it.
[01:18:16.940 --> 01:18:18.220]   Okay, you're gonna put in an image
[01:18:18.220 --> 01:18:20.400]   and you're gonna get out a classification
[01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:22.000]   and you're gonna do that as fast as possible.
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:23.140]   So you care about time,
[01:18:23.140 --> 01:18:26.600]   but time is not part of the essence of this thing really.
[01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:30.020]   Whereas in spiking neural networks,
[01:18:30.020 --> 01:18:31.740]   what we see in the brain,
[01:18:31.740 --> 01:18:33.340]   time is as crucial as space
[01:18:33.340 --> 01:18:35.980]   and they're intimately intertwined as I've tried to say.
[01:18:35.980 --> 01:18:40.260]   And so adaptation on different time scales
[01:18:40.260 --> 01:18:44.080]   is important, not just in memory formation,
[01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:45.340]   although it plays a key role there,
[01:18:45.340 --> 01:18:48.220]   but also in just keeping the activity
[01:18:48.220 --> 01:18:50.300]   in a useful dynamic range.
[01:18:50.300 --> 01:18:52.500]   So you have other plasticity mechanisms,
[01:18:52.500 --> 01:18:54.200]   not just weight update,
[01:18:54.200 --> 01:18:58.740]   or at least not on the time scale of many action potentials,
[01:18:58.740 --> 01:19:00.180]   but even on the shorter time scale.
[01:19:00.180 --> 01:19:04.700]   So a synapse can become much less efficacious.
[01:19:04.700 --> 01:19:07.200]   It can transmit a weaker signal
[01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:08.780]   after the second, third, fourth.
[01:19:08.780 --> 01:19:11.980]   That can second, third, fourth action potential
[01:19:11.980 --> 01:19:13.080]   to occur in a sequence.
[01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:15.980]   So that's what's called short-term synaptic plasticity,
[01:19:15.980 --> 01:19:17.620]   which is a form of learning.
[01:19:17.620 --> 01:19:19.660]   You're learning that I'm getting too much stimulus
[01:19:19.660 --> 01:19:21.660]   from looking at something bright right now.
[01:19:21.660 --> 01:19:23.400]   So I need to tone that down.
[01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:28.580]   There's also another really important mechanism in learning.
[01:19:28.580 --> 01:19:30.540]   It's called metaplasticity.
[01:19:30.540 --> 01:19:33.580]   What that seems to be is a way
[01:19:33.580 --> 01:19:37.420]   that you change not the weights themselves,
[01:19:37.420 --> 01:19:40.260]   but the rate at which the weights change.
[01:19:40.260 --> 01:19:44.580]   So when I am in, say, a lecture hall,
[01:19:44.580 --> 01:19:48.380]   and my, this is a potentially terrible cartoon example,
[01:19:48.380 --> 01:19:49.660]   but let's say I'm in a lecture hall
[01:19:49.660 --> 01:19:51.960]   and it's time to learn, right?
[01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:55.300]   So my brain will release more, perhaps, dopamine
[01:19:55.300 --> 01:19:58.380]   or some neuromodulator that's gonna change
[01:19:58.380 --> 01:20:02.260]   the rate at which synaptic plasticity occurs.
[01:20:02.260 --> 01:20:03.820]   So that can make me more sensitive
[01:20:03.820 --> 01:20:05.340]   to learning at certain times,
[01:20:05.340 --> 01:20:08.380]   more sensitive to overriding previous information,
[01:20:08.380 --> 01:20:10.340]   and less sensitive at other times.
[01:20:10.340 --> 01:20:13.180]   And finally, as long as I'm rattling off the list,
[01:20:13.180 --> 01:20:16.480]   I think another concept that falls in the category
[01:20:16.480 --> 01:20:20.540]   of learning or memory adaptation is homeostasis
[01:20:20.540 --> 01:20:22.420]   or homeostatic adaptation,
[01:20:22.420 --> 01:20:24.940]   where neurons have the ability
[01:20:24.940 --> 01:20:27.780]   to control their firing rate.
[01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:31.180]   So if one neuron is just like blasting way too much,
[01:20:31.180 --> 01:20:33.000]   it will naturally tone itself down.
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:37.380]   Its threshold will adjust so that it stays
[01:20:37.380 --> 01:20:38.500]   in a useful dynamical range.
[01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:41.660]   And we see that's captured in deep neural networks
[01:20:41.660 --> 01:20:43.300]   where you don't just change the synaptic weights,
[01:20:43.300 --> 01:20:44.780]   but you can also move the thresholds
[01:20:44.780 --> 01:20:47.580]   of simple neurons in those models.
[01:20:47.580 --> 01:20:52.580]   - And so to achieve the spiking neural networks,
[01:20:52.580 --> 01:20:56.400]   you want to use, like,
[01:20:56.400 --> 01:21:01.200]   you want to implement the first principles
[01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:03.380]   that you mentioned of the temporal
[01:21:03.380 --> 01:21:07.020]   and the spatial fractal dynamics here.
[01:21:07.020 --> 01:21:09.260]   So you can communicate locally,
[01:21:09.260 --> 01:21:13.300]   you can communicate across much greater distances
[01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:15.980]   and do the same thing in space
[01:21:15.980 --> 01:21:18.020]   and do the same thing in time.
[01:21:18.020 --> 01:21:21.020]   Now, you have, like, a chapter called
[01:21:21.020 --> 01:21:24.340]   superconducting hardware for neuromorphic computing.
[01:21:24.340 --> 01:21:27.740]   So what are some ideas that integrate
[01:21:27.740 --> 01:21:29.060]   some of the things we've been talking about
[01:21:29.060 --> 01:21:30.440]   in terms of the first principles
[01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:33.460]   of neuromorphic computing and the ideas
[01:21:33.460 --> 01:21:38.040]   that you outline in optoelectronic intelligence?
[01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:40.920]   - Yeah, so let me start, I guess,
[01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:42.500]   on the communication side of things,
[01:21:42.500 --> 01:21:46.260]   'cause that's what led us down this track
[01:21:46.260 --> 01:21:47.100]   in the first place.
[01:21:47.100 --> 01:21:51.900]   By us, I'm talking about my team of colleagues at NIST,
[01:21:51.900 --> 01:21:54.020]   you know, Sayeed Han, Bryce Primavera,
[01:21:54.020 --> 01:21:56.500]   Sonia Buckley, Jeff Childs, Adam McConn,
[01:21:56.500 --> 01:21:58.700]   to name Alex Tate, to name a few,
[01:21:58.700 --> 01:22:01.200]   our group leader, Sebu Nam and Rich Miren.
[01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:02.440]   We've all contributed to this,
[01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:05.840]   so this is not me saying necessarily
[01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:07.520]   just the things that I've proposed,
[01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:09.540]   but sort of where our team's thinking
[01:22:09.540 --> 01:22:11.520]   has evolved over the years.
[01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:14.640]   - Can I quickly ask, what is NIST
[01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:18.040]   and where is this amazing group of people located?
[01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:21.700]   - NIST is the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
[01:22:21.700 --> 01:22:26.660]   The larger facility is out in Gaithersburg, Maryland.
[01:22:26.660 --> 01:22:29.680]   Our team is located in Boulder, Colorado.
[01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:36.200]   NIST is a federal agency under the Department of Commerce.
[01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:40.160]   We do a lot with, by we, I mean other people at NIST,
[01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:42.620]   do a lot with standards, you know,
[01:22:42.620 --> 01:22:46.080]   making sure that we understand the system of units,
[01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:49.320]   international system of units, precision measurements.
[01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:53.540]   There's a lot going on in electrical engineering,
[01:22:53.540 --> 01:22:54.760]   material science.
[01:22:54.760 --> 01:22:55.720]   - And it's historic.
[01:22:55.720 --> 01:22:57.520]   I mean, it's like, it's one of those,
[01:22:57.520 --> 01:22:59.040]   it's like MIT or something like that.
[01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:00.960]   It has a reputation over many decades
[01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:03.400]   of just being this really,
[01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:05.640]   a place where there's a lot of brilliant people
[01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:07.600]   have done a lot of amazing things.
[01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:09.760]   But in terms of the people in your team,
[01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:12.740]   in this team of people involved
[01:23:12.740 --> 01:23:14.580]   in the concept we're talking about now,
[01:23:14.580 --> 01:23:16.400]   I'm just curious, what kind of disciplines
[01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:17.240]   are we talking about?
[01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:18.080]   What is it?
[01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:20.240]   - Mostly physicists and electrical engineers,
[01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:21.880]   some material scientists,
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.040]   but I would say, yeah,
[01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:27.240]   I think physicists and electrical engineers,
[01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:29.480]   my background is in photonics,
[01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:31.040]   the use of light for technology.
[01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:33.360]   So coming from there,
[01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:36.840]   I tend to have found colleagues
[01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:38.260]   that are more from that background.
[01:23:38.260 --> 01:23:40.280]   Although Adam McConn,
[01:23:40.280 --> 01:23:42.720]   more of a superconducting electronics background,
[01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:44.300]   we need a diversity of folks.
[01:23:44.300 --> 01:23:46.840]   This project is sort of cross-disciplinary.
[01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:48.300]   I would love to be working more
[01:23:48.300 --> 01:23:50.800]   with neuroscientists and things,
[01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:53.920]   but we haven't reached that scale yet.
[01:23:53.920 --> 01:23:54.760]   But yeah.
[01:23:54.760 --> 01:23:56.480]   - You're focused on the hardware side,
[01:23:56.480 --> 01:23:59.200]   which requires all the disciplines that you mentioned.
[01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:00.040]   And then of course,
[01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:02.120]   neuroscience may be a source of inspiration
[01:24:02.120 --> 01:24:04.360]   for some of the long-term vision.
[01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:06.240]   - I would actually call it more than inspiration.
[01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:11.080]   I would call it sort of a roadmap.
[01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:15.000]   We're not trying to build exactly the brain,
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.520]   but I don't think it's enough to just say,
[01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:19.240]   oh, neurons kind of work like that,
[01:24:19.240 --> 01:24:20.760]   let's kind of do that thing.
[01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:25.360]   I mean, we're very much following the concepts
[01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:27.440]   that the cognitive sciences have laid out for us,
[01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:30.520]   which I believe is a really robust roadmap.
[01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:33.060]   I mean, just on a little bit of a tangent,
[01:24:33.060 --> 01:24:36.100]   it's often stated that we just don't understand the brain,
[01:24:36.100 --> 01:24:37.960]   and so it's really hard to replicate it
[01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:40.400]   because we just don't know what's going on there.
[01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:43.560]   And maybe five or seven years ago,
[01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:44.800]   I would have said that,
[01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:47.880]   but as I got more interested in the subject,
[01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:50.480]   I read more of the neuroscience literature,
[01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:53.640]   and I was just taken by the exact opposite sense.
[01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:55.880]   I can't believe how much they know about this.
[01:24:55.880 --> 01:24:59.280]   I can't believe how mathematically rigorous
[01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:04.200]   and sort of theoretically complete a lot of the concepts are.
[01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:06.660]   That's not to say we understand consciousness
[01:25:06.660 --> 01:25:08.560]   or we understand the self or anything like that,
[01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:11.020]   but what is the brain doing,
[01:25:11.020 --> 01:25:13.560]   and why is it doing those things?
[01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:15.980]   Neuroscientists have a lot of answers to those questions.
[01:25:15.980 --> 01:25:17.840]   So there's a lot, if you're a hardware designer
[01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:19.440]   that just wants to get going,
[01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:23.000]   whoa, it's pretty clear which direction to go in, I think.
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.280]   - Okay, so (laughs)
[01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:28.260]   I love the optimism behind that,
[01:25:28.260 --> 01:25:31.120]   but in the implementation of these systems
[01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:37.040]   that uses superconductivity,
[01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:38.360]   how do you make it happen?
[01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:41.880]   - So to me, it starts with thinking
[01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:43.400]   about the communication network.
[01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:47.540]   You know for sure that the ability of each neuron
[01:25:47.540 --> 01:25:50.560]   to communicate to many thousands of colleagues
[01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:52.360]   across the network is indispensable.
[01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:56.280]   I take that as a core principle of my architecture,
[01:25:56.280 --> 01:25:57.640]   my thinking on the subject.
[01:25:57.640 --> 01:26:02.280]   So coming from a background in photonics,
[01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:03.560]   it was very natural to say,
[01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:05.340]   okay, we're gonna use light for communication.
[01:26:05.340 --> 01:26:08.720]   Just in case listeners may not know,
[01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:10.840]   light is often used in communication.
[01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:12.720]   I mean, if you think about radio, that's light.
[01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:15.320]   It's long wavelengths, but it's electromagnetic radiation.
[01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:17.620]   It's the same physical phenomenon
[01:26:17.620 --> 01:26:20.300]   obeying exactly the same Maxwell's equations.
[01:26:20.300 --> 01:26:24.900]   And then all the way down to fiber optics,
[01:26:24.900 --> 01:26:26.220]   now you're using visible
[01:26:26.220 --> 01:26:27.780]   or near infrared wavelengths of light,
[01:26:27.780 --> 01:26:30.340]   but the way you send messages across the ocean
[01:26:30.340 --> 01:26:33.180]   is now contemporary over optical fibers.
[01:26:33.180 --> 01:26:37.460]   So using light for communication is not a stretch.
[01:26:37.460 --> 01:26:38.940]   It makes perfect sense.
[01:26:38.940 --> 01:26:41.500]   So you might ask, well, why don't you use light
[01:26:41.500 --> 01:26:45.260]   for communication in a conventional microchip?
[01:26:45.260 --> 01:26:49.240]   And the answer to that is, I believe, physical.
[01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:53.060]   If we had a light source on a silicon chip
[01:26:53.060 --> 01:26:55.280]   that was as simple as a transistor,
[01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:58.200]   there would not be a processor in the world
[01:26:58.200 --> 01:26:59.720]   that didn't use light for communication,
[01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:01.760]   at least above some distance.
[01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:04.000]   - How many light sources are needed?
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.800]   Oh, you need a light source at every single point.
[01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:08.400]   - A light source per neuron.
[01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:09.920]   - Per neuron, per little,
[01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:13.040]   but then if you could have a really small
[01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:16.600]   and nice light source, your definition of neuron
[01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:17.940]   could be flexible.
[01:27:17.940 --> 01:27:19.160]   - Could be, yes, yes.
[01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:21.720]   Sometimes it's helpful to me to say,
[01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:24.560]   in this hardware, a neuron is that entity
[01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:25.760]   which has a light source.
[01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:28.000]   That is, and I can explain--
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:29.520]   - And then there was light.
[01:27:29.520 --> 01:27:32.280]   - I mean, I can explain more about that, but--
[01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:34.680]   - Somehow this rhymes with consciousness,
[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:38.240]   'cause people often say the light of consciousness.
[01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:41.680]   So that consciousness is that which is conscious.
[01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:42.520]   I got it.
[01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:43.600]   (laughing)
[01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:44.840]   - That's not my quote.
[01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:47.000]   - That's me, that's my quote.
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.480]   See, that quote comes from my background.
[01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:53.600]   Yours is in optics, mine in light, mine's in darkness.
[01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:55.400]   (laughing)
[01:27:55.400 --> 01:27:57.600]   So go ahead, what were you saying?
[01:27:57.600 --> 01:27:59.600]   - The point I was making there is that
[01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:02.920]   if it was easy to manufacture light sources
[01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:05.720]   along with transistors on a silicon chip,
[01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:07.200]   they would be everywhere.
[01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:08.840]   And it's not easy.
[01:28:08.840 --> 01:28:10.120]   People have been trying for decades
[01:28:10.120 --> 01:28:11.920]   and it's actually extremely difficult.
[01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:13.680]   I think an important part of our research
[01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:17.360]   is dwelling right at that spot there.
[01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:18.720]   - Is it physics or engineering?
[01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:19.560]   - It's physics.
[01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:22.240]   So, okay, so it's physics, I think.
[01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:26.920]   So what I mean by that is, as we discussed,
[01:28:26.920 --> 01:28:29.400]   silicon is the material of choice for transistors
[01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:33.240]   and it's very difficult to imagine
[01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:35.200]   that that's gonna change anytime soon.
[01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:39.120]   Silicon is notoriously bad at emitting light,
[01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:43.280]   and that has to do with the immutable properties
[01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:46.240]   of silicon itself, the way that the energy bands
[01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:47.880]   are structured in silicon.
[01:28:47.880 --> 01:28:50.480]   You're never going to make silicon efficient
[01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:53.520]   as a light source at room temperature
[01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:57.440]   without doing very exotic things that degrade its ability
[01:28:57.440 --> 01:28:59.160]   to interface nicely with those transistors
[01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:00.000]   in the first place.
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.600]   So that's like one of these things where it's,
[01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:05.200]   why is nature dealing us that blow?
[01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:07.000]   You give us these beautiful transistors
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:08.640]   and you give us all the motivation
[01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:10.120]   to use light for communication,
[01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:11.520]   but then you don't give us a light source.
[01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:14.000]   So, well, okay, you do give us a light source,
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.120]   compound semiconductors, like we talked about
[01:29:16.120 --> 01:29:18.080]   back at the beginning, an element from group three
[01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:20.320]   and an element from group five form an alloy
[01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:23.680]   where every other lattice site switches which element it is.
[01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:27.280]   Those have much better properties for generating light.
[01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:30.060]   You put electrons in, light comes out.
[01:29:30.060 --> 01:29:33.140]   Almost 100% of the electron hold,
[01:29:33.140 --> 01:29:36.080]   it can be made efficient.
[01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:37.440]   - I'll take your word for it, okay.
[01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:39.600]   - However, I say it's physics, not engineering
[01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:43.160]   because it's very difficult to get those
[01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:45.280]   compound semiconductor light sources
[01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:47.560]   situated with your silicon.
[01:29:47.560 --> 01:29:49.440]   In order to do that ion implantation
[01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:50.800]   that I talked about at the beginning,
[01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:52.760]   high temperatures are required.
[01:29:52.760 --> 01:29:55.700]   So you got to make all of your transistors first
[01:29:55.700 --> 01:29:58.600]   and then put the compound semiconductors on top of there.
[01:29:58.600 --> 01:30:00.860]   You can't grow them afterwards
[01:30:00.860 --> 01:30:02.400]   because that requires high temperature.
[01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:04.060]   It screws up all your transistors.
[01:30:04.060 --> 01:30:05.840]   You try and stick them on there.
[01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:08.000]   They don't have the same lattice constant.
[01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.360]   The spacing between atoms is different enough
[01:30:10.360 --> 01:30:11.680]   that it just doesn't work.
[01:30:11.680 --> 01:30:15.520]   So nature does not seem to be telling us that,
[01:30:15.520 --> 01:30:17.960]   hey, go ahead and combine light sources
[01:30:17.960 --> 01:30:19.960]   with your digital switches
[01:30:19.960 --> 01:30:22.680]   for conventional digital computing.
[01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:24.720]   - And conventional digital computing
[01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:27.640]   will often require smaller scale, I guess,
[01:30:27.640 --> 01:30:29.580]   in terms of like a smartphone.
[01:30:29.580 --> 01:30:35.440]   So in which kind of systems does nature hint
[01:30:35.440 --> 01:30:40.440]   that we can use light and photons for communication?
[01:30:40.440 --> 01:30:43.560]   - Well, so let me just try and be clear.
[01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:46.880]   You can use light for communication in digital systems.
[01:30:46.880 --> 01:30:50.320]   Just the light sources are not intimately integrated
[01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:51.320]   with the silicon.
[01:30:51.320 --> 01:30:52.680]   You manufacture all the silicon,
[01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:55.280]   you have your microchip, plunk it down.
[01:30:55.280 --> 01:30:57.260]   And then you manufacture your light sources,
[01:30:57.260 --> 01:30:59.300]   separate chip, completely different process,
[01:30:59.300 --> 01:31:01.020]   made in a different foundry.
[01:31:01.020 --> 01:31:03.760]   And then you put those together at the package level.
[01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:06.720]   So now you have some,
[01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:10.080]   I would say a great deal of architectural limitations
[01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:14.480]   that are introduced by that sort of
[01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:17.080]   package level integration as opposed to monolithic
[01:31:17.080 --> 01:31:18.520]   on the same chip integration.
[01:31:18.520 --> 01:31:20.120]   But it's still a very useful thing to do.
[01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:23.660]   And that's where I had done some work previously
[01:31:23.660 --> 01:31:24.640]   before I came to NIST.
[01:31:24.640 --> 01:31:28.440]   There's a project led by Vladimir Stoyanovich
[01:31:28.440 --> 01:31:31.360]   that now spun out into a company called IR Labs,
[01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:33.720]   led by Mark Wade and Chen Sun,
[01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:35.000]   where they're doing exactly that.
[01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:36.960]   So you have your light source chip,
[01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:39.760]   your silicon chip, whatever it may be doing,
[01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:40.880]   maybe it's digital electronics,
[01:31:40.880 --> 01:31:43.620]   maybe it's some other control purpose, something.
[01:31:43.620 --> 01:31:47.760]   And the silicon chip drives the light source chip
[01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:49.760]   and modulates the intensity of the light.
[01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:52.640]   So you can get data out of the package on an optical fiber.
[01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:56.560]   And that still gives you tremendous advantages in bandwidth
[01:31:56.560 --> 01:31:58.820]   as opposed to sending those signals out
[01:31:58.820 --> 01:32:00.760]   over electrical lines.
[01:32:00.760 --> 01:32:05.160]   But it is somewhat peculiar to my eye
[01:32:05.160 --> 01:32:07.880]   that they have to be integrated at this package level.
[01:32:07.880 --> 01:32:09.760]   And those people, I mean, they're so smart.
[01:32:09.760 --> 01:32:12.880]   Those are my colleagues that I respect a great deal.
[01:32:12.880 --> 01:32:15.520]   So it's very clear that it's not just
[01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:18.760]   they're making a bad choice.
[01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:20.480]   This is what physics is telling us.
[01:32:20.480 --> 01:32:22.280]   It just wouldn't make any sense
[01:32:22.280 --> 01:32:24.240]   to try to stick them together.
[01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:26.520]   - Yeah, so even if it's difficult,
[01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:30.880]   it's easier than the alternative, unfortunately.
[01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:31.720]   - I think so, yes.
[01:32:31.720 --> 01:32:33.280]   And again, I need to go back
[01:32:33.280 --> 01:32:35.100]   and make sure that I'm not taking the wrong way.
[01:32:35.100 --> 01:32:36.800]   I'm not saying that the pursuit
[01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:39.400]   of integrating compound semiconductors with silicon
[01:32:39.400 --> 01:32:41.140]   is fruitless and shouldn't be pursued.
[01:32:41.140 --> 01:32:43.440]   It should, and people are doing great work.
[01:32:43.440 --> 01:32:45.680]   Kai May Lau and John Bowers, others,
[01:32:45.680 --> 01:32:48.240]   they're doing it and they're making progress.
[01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:50.500]   But to my eye, it doesn't look like
[01:32:50.500 --> 01:32:52.200]   that's ever going to be
[01:32:53.660 --> 01:32:58.600]   just the standard monolithic light source on silicon process.
[01:32:58.600 --> 01:33:00.020]   I just don't see it.
[01:33:00.020 --> 01:33:02.860]   - Yeah, so nature kind of points the way usually.
[01:33:02.860 --> 01:33:04.500]   And if you resist nature,
[01:33:04.500 --> 01:33:05.700]   you're going to have to do a lot more work.
[01:33:05.700 --> 01:33:07.700]   - And it's going to be expensive and not scalable.
[01:33:07.700 --> 01:33:08.540]   - Got it.
[01:33:08.540 --> 01:33:11.300]   But okay, so let's go far into the future.
[01:33:11.300 --> 01:33:14.760]   Let's imagine this gigantic neuromorphic computing system
[01:33:14.760 --> 01:33:17.340]   that simulates all of our realities.
[01:33:17.340 --> 01:33:19.060]   It currently is, we mentioned matrix four.
[01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:23.200]   So this thing, this powerful computer,
[01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:24.880]   how does it operate?
[01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:27.520]   So what are the neurons?
[01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:29.060]   What is the communication?
[01:33:29.060 --> 01:33:30.020]   What's your sense?
[01:33:30.020 --> 01:33:32.460]   - All right, so let me now,
[01:33:32.460 --> 01:33:34.180]   after spending 45 minutes
[01:33:34.180 --> 01:33:36.140]   trashing light source integration with silicon,
[01:33:36.140 --> 01:33:40.140]   let me now say why I'm basing my entire life,
[01:33:40.140 --> 01:33:41.060]   professional life,
[01:33:41.060 --> 01:33:44.960]   on integrating light sources with electronics.
[01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:47.020]   I think the game is completely different
[01:33:47.020 --> 01:33:49.580]   when you're talking about superconducting electronics.
[01:33:49.580 --> 01:33:51.800]   For several reasons,
[01:33:52.740 --> 01:33:54.240]   let me try to go through them.
[01:33:54.240 --> 01:33:56.480]   One is that, as I mentioned,
[01:33:56.480 --> 01:33:57.960]   it's difficult to integrate
[01:33:57.960 --> 01:34:01.280]   those compound semiconductor light sources with silicon.
[01:34:01.280 --> 01:34:03.600]   With silicon is a requirement
[01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:05.240]   that is introduced by the fact
[01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:07.280]   that you're using semiconducting electronics.
[01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:08.840]   In superconducting electronics,
[01:34:08.840 --> 01:34:10.840]   you're still going to start with a silicon wafer,
[01:34:10.840 --> 01:34:13.880]   but it's just the bread for your sandwich in a lot of ways.
[01:34:13.880 --> 01:34:15.800]   You're not using that silicon
[01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:17.720]   in precisely the same way for the electronics.
[01:34:17.720 --> 01:34:20.460]   You're now depositing superconducting materials
[01:34:20.460 --> 01:34:21.840]   on top of that.
[01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:24.520]   The prospects for integrating light sources
[01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:27.400]   with that kind of an electronic process
[01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:30.460]   are certainly less explored,
[01:34:30.460 --> 01:34:31.940]   but I think much more promising
[01:34:31.940 --> 01:34:34.260]   because you don't need those light sources
[01:34:34.260 --> 01:34:36.580]   to be intimately integrated with the transistors.
[01:34:36.580 --> 01:34:37.900]   That's where the problems come up.
[01:34:37.900 --> 01:34:39.900]   They don't need to be lattice matched to the silicon,
[01:34:39.900 --> 01:34:41.140]   all that kind of stuff.
[01:34:41.140 --> 01:34:43.600]   Instead, it seems possible
[01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:47.300]   that you can take those compound semiconductor light sources,
[01:34:47.300 --> 01:34:49.140]   stick them on the silicon wafer,
[01:34:49.140 --> 01:34:51.380]   and then grow your superconducting electronics
[01:34:51.380 --> 01:34:52.280]   on the top of that.
[01:34:52.280 --> 01:34:55.760]   It's at least not obviously going to fail.
[01:34:55.760 --> 01:34:57.260]   - So the computation would be done
[01:34:57.260 --> 01:35:00.100]   on the superconductive material as well?
[01:35:00.100 --> 01:35:01.940]   - Yes, the computation is done
[01:35:01.940 --> 01:35:03.920]   in the superconducting electronics,
[01:35:03.920 --> 01:35:06.720]   and the light sources receive signals that say,
[01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:08.200]   hey, a neuron reached threshold,
[01:35:08.200 --> 01:35:09.800]   produce a pulse of light,
[01:35:09.800 --> 01:35:12.460]   send it out to all your downstream synaptic connections.
[01:35:12.460 --> 01:35:16.220]   Those are, again, superconducting electronics.
[01:35:16.220 --> 01:35:19.620]   Perform your computation, and you're off to the races.
[01:35:19.620 --> 01:35:20.780]   Your network works.
[01:35:20.780 --> 01:35:22.620]   - So then if we can rewind real quick,
[01:35:22.620 --> 01:35:25.980]   so what are the limitations or the challenges
[01:35:25.980 --> 01:35:28.940]   of superconducting electronics
[01:35:28.940 --> 01:35:31.500]   when we think about constructing these kinds of systems?
[01:35:31.500 --> 01:35:35.620]   - So actually, let me say one other thing
[01:35:35.620 --> 01:35:36.940]   about the light sources.
[01:35:36.940 --> 01:35:37.780]   - Yes, please.
[01:35:37.780 --> 01:35:39.840]   - And then I'll move on, I promise,
[01:35:39.840 --> 01:35:42.340]   'cause this is probably tedious for some.
[01:35:42.340 --> 01:35:44.020]   - This is super exciting.
[01:35:44.020 --> 01:35:45.740]   - Okay, one other thing about the light sources.
[01:35:45.740 --> 01:35:48.900]   I said that silicon is terrible at emitting photons.
[01:35:48.900 --> 01:35:50.660]   It's just not what it's meant to do.
[01:35:50.660 --> 01:35:52.820]   However, the game is different
[01:35:52.820 --> 01:35:54.060]   when you're at low temperature.
[01:35:54.060 --> 01:35:55.700]   If you're working with superconductors,
[01:35:55.700 --> 01:35:56.980]   you have to be at low temperature
[01:35:56.980 --> 01:35:58.700]   'cause they don't work otherwise.
[01:35:58.700 --> 01:36:00.260]   When you're at four Kelvin,
[01:36:00.260 --> 01:36:03.420]   silicon is not obviously a terrible light source.
[01:36:03.420 --> 01:36:05.860]   It's still not as efficient as compound semiconductors,
[01:36:05.860 --> 01:36:08.680]   but it might be good enough for this application.
[01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:11.300]   The final thing that I'll mention about that is, again,
[01:36:11.300 --> 01:36:13.980]   leveraging superconductors, as I said,
[01:36:13.980 --> 01:36:15.380]   in a different context,
[01:36:15.380 --> 01:36:19.540]   superconducting detectors can receive one single photon.
[01:36:19.540 --> 01:36:21.260]   In that conversation, I failed to mention
[01:36:21.260 --> 01:36:23.460]   that semiconductors can also receive photons.
[01:36:23.460 --> 01:36:26.220]   That's the primary mechanism by which it's done.
[01:36:26.220 --> 01:36:29.180]   A camera in your phone that's receptive to visible light
[01:36:29.180 --> 01:36:31.100]   is receiving photons.
[01:36:31.100 --> 01:36:32.220]   It's based on silicon,
[01:36:32.220 --> 01:36:34.380]   or you can make it in different semiconductors
[01:36:34.380 --> 01:36:36.580]   for different wavelengths,
[01:36:36.580 --> 01:36:39.580]   but it requires on the order of 1,000,
[01:36:39.580 --> 01:36:43.580]   a few thousand photons to receive a pulse.
[01:36:43.580 --> 01:36:46.160]   Now, when you're using a superconducting detector,
[01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:48.360]   you need one photon, exactly one.
[01:36:48.360 --> 01:36:50.860]   I mean, one or more.
[01:36:50.860 --> 01:36:54.840]   So the fact that your synapses can now be based
[01:36:54.840 --> 01:36:56.660]   on superconducting detectors
[01:36:56.660 --> 01:36:58.800]   instead of semiconducting detectors
[01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:00.700]   brings the light levels that are required
[01:37:00.700 --> 01:37:03.140]   down by some three orders of magnitude.
[01:37:03.140 --> 01:37:06.540]   So now you don't need good light sources.
[01:37:06.540 --> 01:37:08.780]   You can have the world's worst light sources.
[01:37:08.780 --> 01:37:11.820]   As long as they spit out maybe a few thousand photons
[01:37:11.820 --> 01:37:13.780]   every time a neuron fires,
[01:37:13.780 --> 01:37:17.640]   you have the hardware principles in place
[01:37:17.640 --> 01:37:19.620]   that you might be able to perform
[01:37:19.620 --> 01:37:21.700]   this optoelectronic integration.
[01:37:21.700 --> 01:37:25.020]   To me, optoelectronic integration, it's just so enticing.
[01:37:25.020 --> 01:37:26.980]   We want to be able to leverage
[01:37:26.980 --> 01:37:30.380]   electronics for computation, light for communication,
[01:37:30.380 --> 01:37:32.820]   working with silicon microelectronics at room temperature
[01:37:32.820 --> 01:37:35.020]   that has been exceedingly difficult.
[01:37:35.020 --> 01:37:39.980]   And I hope that when we move to the superconducting domain,
[01:37:39.980 --> 01:37:41.820]   target a different application space
[01:37:41.820 --> 01:37:44.900]   that is neuromorphic instead of digital
[01:37:44.900 --> 01:37:47.660]   and use superconducting detectors,
[01:37:47.660 --> 01:37:50.120]   maybe optoelectronic integration comes to us.
[01:37:50.120 --> 01:37:51.720]   - Okay, so there's a bunch of questions.
[01:37:51.720 --> 01:37:53.680]   So one is temperature.
[01:37:53.680 --> 01:37:58.320]   So in these kind of hybrid heterogeneous systems,
[01:37:58.320 --> 01:37:59.560]   what's the temperature?
[01:37:59.560 --> 01:38:01.600]   What are some of the constraints of the operation here?
[01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:03.600]   Does it all have to be at four Kelvin as well?
[01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:04.440]   - Four Kelvin.
[01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:06.840]   Everything has to be at four Kelvin.
[01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:09.720]   - Okay, so what are the other engineering challenges
[01:38:09.720 --> 01:38:14.320]   of making this kind of optoelectronic systems?
[01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:16.540]   - Let me just dwell on that four Kelvin for a second
[01:38:16.540 --> 01:38:18.300]   because some people hear four Kelvin
[01:38:18.300 --> 01:38:19.260]   and they just get up and leave.
[01:38:19.260 --> 01:38:21.540]   They just say, "I'm not doing it."
[01:38:21.540 --> 01:38:25.340]   And to me, that's very earth-centric, species-centric.
[01:38:25.340 --> 01:38:27.260]   We live in 300 Kelvin,
[01:38:27.260 --> 01:38:29.140]   so we want our technologies to operate there too.
[01:38:29.140 --> 01:38:30.100]   I totally get it.
[01:38:30.100 --> 01:38:31.900]   - Yeah, what's zero Celsius?
[01:38:31.900 --> 01:38:34.500]   - Zero Celsius is 273 Kelvin.
[01:38:34.500 --> 01:38:37.620]   So we're talking very, very cold here.
[01:38:37.620 --> 01:38:39.540]   - Not even Boston cold.
[01:38:39.540 --> 01:38:41.340]   (laughing)
[01:38:41.340 --> 01:38:42.380]   This is real cold.
[01:38:42.380 --> 01:38:43.220]   - Yeah.
[01:38:43.220 --> 01:38:44.040]   - Siberia cold.
[01:38:44.040 --> 01:38:45.660]   - Okay, so just for reference,
[01:38:45.660 --> 01:38:47.900]   the temperature of the cosmic microwave background
[01:38:47.900 --> 01:38:49.380]   is about 2.7 Kelvin.
[01:38:49.380 --> 01:38:51.660]   So we're still warmer than deep space.
[01:38:51.660 --> 01:38:52.980]   - Yeah, good.
[01:38:52.980 --> 01:38:57.940]   So when the universe dies out, it'll be colder than 4K.
[01:38:57.940 --> 01:38:59.380]   - It's already colder than 4K.
[01:38:59.380 --> 01:39:03.860]   In the expanses, you don't have to get that far
[01:39:03.860 --> 01:39:06.940]   away from the earth in order to drop down
[01:39:06.940 --> 01:39:07.780]   to not far from four Kelvin.
[01:39:07.780 --> 01:39:09.820]   - So what you're saying is the aliens that live
[01:39:09.820 --> 01:39:13.280]   at the edge of the observable universe
[01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:16.420]   are using superconducting material for their computation.
[01:39:16.420 --> 01:39:17.860]   - They don't have to live at the edge of the universe.
[01:39:17.860 --> 01:39:21.040]   The aliens that are more advanced than us
[01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:26.040]   in their solar system are doing this in their asteroid belt.
[01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:27.780]   We can get to that.
[01:39:27.780 --> 01:39:31.660]   - Oh, because they can get to that temperature easier there?
[01:39:31.660 --> 01:39:33.780]   - Sure, yeah, all you have to do is reflect the sunlight
[01:39:33.780 --> 01:39:36.060]   away and you have a huge head start.
[01:39:36.060 --> 01:39:37.660]   - Oh, so the sun is the problem here.
[01:39:37.660 --> 01:39:39.020]   Like it's warm here on earth.
[01:39:39.020 --> 01:39:39.860]   Got it.
[01:39:39.860 --> 01:39:40.700]   - Yeah.
[01:39:40.700 --> 01:39:42.900]   - Okay, so how do we get to 4K?
[01:39:42.900 --> 01:39:47.900]   - Well, okay, so what I want to say about temperature
[01:39:47.900 --> 01:39:53.940]   is that if you can swallow that, if you can say,
[01:39:53.940 --> 01:39:56.760]   all right, I give up applications that have to do
[01:39:56.760 --> 01:40:01.420]   with my cell phone and the convenience of a laptop
[01:40:01.420 --> 01:40:04.300]   on a train and you instead, for me,
[01:40:04.300 --> 01:40:06.420]   I'm very much in the scientific headspace.
[01:40:06.420 --> 01:40:07.940]   I'm not looking at products.
[01:40:07.940 --> 01:40:09.880]   I'm not looking at what this will be useful
[01:40:09.880 --> 01:40:11.000]   to sell to consumers.
[01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.380]   Instead, I'm thinking about scientific questions.
[01:40:13.380 --> 01:40:16.540]   Well, it's just not that bad to have to work at 4K.
[01:40:16.540 --> 01:40:18.940]   We do it all the time in our labs at NIST.
[01:40:18.940 --> 01:40:21.400]   And so does, I mean, for reference,
[01:40:21.400 --> 01:40:25.540]   the entire quantum computing sector
[01:40:25.540 --> 01:40:28.620]   usually has to work at something like 100 millikelvin,
[01:40:28.620 --> 01:40:29.640]   50 millikelvin.
[01:40:29.640 --> 01:40:32.100]   So now you're talking of another factor of 100
[01:40:32.100 --> 01:40:35.100]   even colder than that, a fraction of a degree.
[01:40:35.100 --> 01:40:37.340]   And everybody seems to think quantum computing
[01:40:37.340 --> 01:40:39.160]   is gonna take over the world.
[01:40:39.160 --> 01:40:41.580]   It's so much more expensive to have to get
[01:40:41.580 --> 01:40:46.580]   that extra factor of 10 or whatever colder.
[01:40:46.580 --> 01:40:49.260]   And yet it's not stopping people from investing
[01:40:49.260 --> 01:40:50.260]   in that area.
[01:40:50.260 --> 01:40:53.840]   And by investing, I mean, putting their research into it
[01:40:53.840 --> 01:40:55.740]   as well as venture capital or whatever.
[01:40:55.740 --> 01:40:59.580]   - So based on the energy of what you're commenting on,
[01:40:59.580 --> 01:41:01.940]   I'm getting a sense that's one of the criticism
[01:41:01.940 --> 01:41:06.700]   of this approach is 4K, 4Kelvin is a big negative.
[01:41:06.700 --> 01:41:10.680]   It is the showstopper for a lot of people.
[01:41:10.680 --> 01:41:12.880]   They just, I mean, and understandably,
[01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:16.880]   I'm not saying that that's not a consideration.
[01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:17.840]   Of course it is.
[01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:20.480]   For some, okay, so different motivations
[01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:21.480]   for different people.
[01:41:21.480 --> 01:41:24.440]   In the academic world, suppose you spent your whole life
[01:41:24.440 --> 01:41:26.800]   learning about silicon microelectronic circuits.
[01:41:26.800 --> 01:41:30.560]   You send a design to a foundry, they send you back a chip
[01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:33.020]   and you go test it at your tabletop.
[01:41:33.020 --> 01:41:35.720]   And now I'm saying, here, now learn how to use
[01:41:35.720 --> 01:41:38.460]   all these cryogenics so you can do that at 4Kelvin.
[01:41:38.460 --> 01:41:41.220]   No, come on, man, I don't wanna do that.
[01:41:41.220 --> 01:41:42.060]   That sounds bad.
[01:41:42.060 --> 01:41:44.540]   - It's the old momentum, the Titanic of the turning.
[01:41:44.540 --> 01:41:45.640]   - Yeah, kind of.
[01:41:45.640 --> 01:41:48.380]   - But you're saying that's not too much of a,
[01:41:48.380 --> 01:41:51.140]   when we're looking at large systems and the gain
[01:41:51.140 --> 01:41:52.380]   you can potentially get from them,
[01:41:52.380 --> 01:41:53.460]   that's not that much of a cost.
[01:41:53.460 --> 01:41:55.180]   - And when you wanna answer the scientific question
[01:41:55.180 --> 01:41:58.160]   about what are the physical limits of cognition?
[01:41:58.160 --> 01:42:00.500]   Well, the physical limits, they don't care
[01:42:00.500 --> 01:42:01.460]   if you're at 4Kelvin.
[01:42:01.460 --> 01:42:04.620]   If you can perform cognition at a scale,
[01:42:04.620 --> 01:42:07.680]   orders of magnitude beyond any room temperature technology,
[01:42:07.680 --> 01:42:10.440]   but you gotta get cold to do it, you're gonna do it.
[01:42:10.440 --> 01:42:14.600]   And to me, that's the interesting application space.
[01:42:14.600 --> 01:42:16.120]   It's not even an application space.
[01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:18.920]   That's the interesting scientific paradigm.
[01:42:18.920 --> 01:42:22.560]   So I personally am not going to let low temperature
[01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:26.560]   stop me from realizing a technological domain
[01:42:26.560 --> 01:42:32.740]   or realm that is achieving in most ways
[01:42:33.060 --> 01:42:36.160]   everything else that I'm looking for in my hardware.
[01:42:36.160 --> 01:42:37.640]   - So that, okay, that's a big one.
[01:42:37.640 --> 01:42:40.000]   Is there other kind of engineering challenges
[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:40.840]   that you envision?
[01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:41.660]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:42:41.660 --> 01:42:43.120]   So let me take a moment here
[01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:45.760]   because I haven't really described what I mean
[01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:49.000]   by a neuron or a network in this particular hardware.
[01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.640]   - Yeah, do you wanna talk about loop neurons?
[01:42:51.640 --> 01:42:53.680]   And there's so many fascinating,
[01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:55.960]   but you just have so many amazing papers
[01:42:55.960 --> 01:42:57.720]   that people should definitely check out.
[01:42:57.720 --> 01:42:59.840]   And the titles alone are just killer.
[01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:01.080]   So anyway, go ahead.
[01:43:01.080 --> 01:43:06.040]   - Right, so let me say big picture based on optics,
[01:43:06.040 --> 01:43:07.740]   photonics for communication,
[01:43:07.740 --> 01:43:10.140]   superconducting electronics for computation.
[01:43:10.140 --> 01:43:11.500]   How does this all work?
[01:43:11.500 --> 01:43:16.500]   So a neuron in this hardware platform
[01:43:16.500 --> 01:43:19.540]   can be thought of as circuits
[01:43:19.540 --> 01:43:21.100]   that are based on Joseph's injunctions,
[01:43:21.100 --> 01:43:22.700]   like we talked about before,
[01:43:22.700 --> 01:43:25.300]   where every time a photon comes in,
[01:43:25.300 --> 01:43:27.140]   so let's start by talking about a synapse.
[01:43:27.140 --> 01:43:29.700]   A synapse receives a photon, one or more,
[01:43:29.700 --> 01:43:31.440]   from a different neuron,
[01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:33.600]   and it converts that optical signal
[01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:35.340]   to an electrical signal.
[01:43:35.340 --> 01:43:38.940]   The amount of current that that adds to a loop
[01:43:38.940 --> 01:43:40.820]   is controlled by the synaptic weight.
[01:43:40.820 --> 01:43:42.360]   So as I said before,
[01:43:42.360 --> 01:43:44.520]   you're popping fluxons into a loop, right?
[01:43:44.520 --> 01:43:46.440]   So a photon comes in,
[01:43:46.440 --> 01:43:49.200]   it hits a superconducting single photon detector,
[01:43:49.200 --> 01:43:52.100]   one photon, the absolute physical minimum
[01:43:52.100 --> 01:43:53.040]   that you can communicate
[01:43:53.040 --> 01:43:54.520]   from one place to another with light.
[01:43:54.520 --> 01:43:56.120]   - And that detector then converts that
[01:43:56.120 --> 01:43:57.380]   into an electrical signal,
[01:43:57.380 --> 01:44:00.000]   and the amount of the signal is correlated
[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:01.200]   with some kind of weight.
[01:44:01.200 --> 01:44:02.920]   - Yeah, so the synaptic weight will tell you
[01:44:02.920 --> 01:44:05.480]   how many fluxons you pop into the loop.
[01:44:05.480 --> 01:44:06.600]   It's an analog number.
[01:44:06.600 --> 01:44:08.160]   We're doing analog computation now.
[01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:09.760]   - Well, can you just linger on that?
[01:44:09.760 --> 01:44:11.040]   What the heck is a fluxon?
[01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:12.000]   Are we supposed to know this?
[01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:15.640]   Or is this a funny, it's like the Big Bang.
[01:44:15.640 --> 01:44:18.880]   Is this a funny word for something deeply technical?
[01:44:18.880 --> 01:44:21.080]   - No, let's try to avoid using the word fluxon
[01:44:21.080 --> 01:44:23.000]   'cause it's not actually necessary.
[01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:23.840]   When a photon--
[01:44:23.840 --> 01:44:25.480]   - It's fun to say, though.
[01:44:25.480 --> 01:44:29.040]   So it's very necessary, I would say.
[01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:31.260]   - When a photon hits that superconducting
[01:44:31.260 --> 01:44:32.940]   single photon detector,
[01:44:32.940 --> 01:44:36.580]   current is added to a superconducting loop,
[01:44:36.580 --> 01:44:39.220]   and the amount of current that you add
[01:44:39.220 --> 01:44:40.340]   is an analog value.
[01:44:40.340 --> 01:44:43.020]   It can have eight-bit equivalent resolution,
[01:44:43.020 --> 01:44:45.460]   something like that, 10 bits, maybe.
[01:44:45.460 --> 01:44:46.980]   - That's amazing, by the way.
[01:44:46.980 --> 01:44:48.540]   This is starting to make a lot more sense.
[01:44:48.540 --> 01:44:50.660]   - When you're using superconductors for this,
[01:44:50.660 --> 01:44:54.740]   the energy of that circulating current
[01:44:54.740 --> 01:44:58.640]   is less than the energy of that photon.
[01:44:58.640 --> 01:45:01.800]   So your energy budget is not destroyed
[01:45:01.800 --> 01:45:04.040]   by doing this analog computation.
[01:45:04.040 --> 01:45:07.120]   So now, in the language of a neuroscientist,
[01:45:07.120 --> 01:45:09.200]   you would say that's your postsynaptic signal.
[01:45:09.200 --> 01:45:11.720]   You have this current being stored in a loop.
[01:45:11.720 --> 01:45:13.520]   You can decide what you wanna do with it.
[01:45:13.520 --> 01:45:16.200]   Most likely, you're gonna have it decay exponentially.
[01:45:16.200 --> 01:45:18.920]   So every single synapse is gonna have
[01:45:18.920 --> 01:45:21.000]   some given time constant,
[01:45:21.020 --> 01:45:25.420]   and that's determined by putting some resistor
[01:45:25.420 --> 01:45:27.100]   in that superconducting loop.
[01:45:27.100 --> 01:45:30.140]   So a synapse event occurs when a photon
[01:45:30.140 --> 01:45:32.480]   strikes a detector, adds current to that loop,
[01:45:32.480 --> 01:45:33.880]   it decays over time.
[01:45:33.880 --> 01:45:35.580]   That's the postsynaptic signal.
[01:45:35.580 --> 01:45:38.420]   Then you can process that in a dendritic tree.
[01:45:38.420 --> 01:45:41.100]   Bryce Primavera and I have a paper
[01:45:41.100 --> 01:45:43.420]   that we've submitted about that.
[01:45:43.420 --> 01:45:45.380]   For the more neuroscience-oriented people,
[01:45:45.380 --> 01:45:47.060]   there's a lot of dendritic processing,
[01:45:47.060 --> 01:45:49.460]   a lot of plasticity mechanisms you can implement
[01:45:49.460 --> 01:45:51.480]   with essentially exactly the same circuits.
[01:45:51.480 --> 01:45:54.460]   You have this one simple building block circuit
[01:45:54.460 --> 01:45:57.260]   that you can use for a synapse, for a dendrite,
[01:45:57.260 --> 01:46:00.320]   for the neuron cell body, for all the plasticity functions.
[01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:02.360]   It's all based on the same building block,
[01:46:02.360 --> 01:46:03.780]   just tweaking a couple parameters.
[01:46:03.780 --> 01:46:05.980]   - So this basic building block has both an optical
[01:46:05.980 --> 01:46:07.260]   and an electrical component,
[01:46:07.260 --> 01:46:09.500]   and then you can just build
[01:46:09.500 --> 01:46:11.660]   arbitrary large systems with that.
[01:46:11.660 --> 01:46:12.500]   - Close.
[01:46:12.500 --> 01:46:14.980]   You're not at fault for thinking that that's what I meant.
[01:46:14.980 --> 01:46:18.780]   What I should say is that if you want it to be a synapse,
[01:46:18.780 --> 01:46:22.260]   you tack a superconducting detector onto the front of it.
[01:46:22.260 --> 01:46:23.460]   And if you want it to be anything else,
[01:46:23.460 --> 01:46:25.260]   there's no optical component.
[01:46:25.260 --> 01:46:26.100]   - Got it.
[01:46:26.100 --> 01:46:28.380]   So at the front, (laughs)
[01:46:28.380 --> 01:46:32.140]   optics in the front, electrical stuff in the back.
[01:46:32.140 --> 01:46:34.140]   - Electrical, yeah, in the processing
[01:46:34.140 --> 01:46:36.460]   and in the output signal that it sends
[01:46:36.460 --> 01:46:39.380]   to the next stage of processing further.
[01:46:39.380 --> 01:46:41.500]   - So the dendritic trees is electrical.
[01:46:41.500 --> 01:46:42.500]   - It's all electrical.
[01:46:42.500 --> 01:46:44.900]   It's all electrical in the superconducting domain.
[01:46:44.900 --> 01:46:48.540]   For anybody who's up on their superconducting circuits,
[01:46:48.540 --> 01:46:52.460]   it's just based on a DC squid, the most ubiquitous,
[01:46:52.460 --> 01:46:55.140]   which is a circuit composed of two Josephson junctions.
[01:46:55.140 --> 01:46:58.700]   So it's a very bread and butter kind of thing.
[01:46:58.700 --> 01:47:00.900]   And then the only place where you go beyond that
[01:47:00.900 --> 01:47:03.020]   is the neuron cell body itself.
[01:47:03.020 --> 01:47:05.300]   It's receiving all these electrical inputs
[01:47:05.300 --> 01:47:06.860]   from the synapses or dendrites,
[01:47:06.860 --> 01:47:09.820]   or however you've structured that particular unique neuron.
[01:47:09.820 --> 01:47:12.300]   And when it reaches its threshold,
[01:47:12.300 --> 01:47:14.380]   which occurs by driving a Josephson junction
[01:47:14.380 --> 01:47:15.740]   above its critical current,
[01:47:15.740 --> 01:47:17.220]   it produces a pulse of current,
[01:47:17.220 --> 01:47:19.460]   which starts an amplification sequence,
[01:47:19.460 --> 01:47:21.380]   voltage amplification,
[01:47:21.380 --> 01:47:24.500]   that produces light out of a transmitter.
[01:47:24.500 --> 01:47:26.860]   So one of our colleagues, Adam McConn,
[01:47:26.860 --> 01:47:27.980]   and Sonia Buckley as well,
[01:47:27.980 --> 01:47:30.980]   did a lot of work on the light sources
[01:47:30.980 --> 01:47:34.660]   and the amplifiers that drive the current
[01:47:34.660 --> 01:47:37.540]   and produce sufficient voltage to drive current
[01:47:37.540 --> 01:47:39.180]   through that now semiconducting part.
[01:47:39.180 --> 01:47:43.180]   So that light source is the semiconducting part of a neuron.
[01:47:43.180 --> 01:47:45.620]   And that, so the neuron has reached threshold.
[01:47:45.620 --> 01:47:47.660]   It produces a pulse of light.
[01:47:47.660 --> 01:47:51.580]   That light then fans out across a network of wave guides
[01:47:51.580 --> 01:47:54.540]   to reach all the downstream synaptic terminals
[01:47:54.540 --> 01:47:57.300]   that perform this process themselves.
[01:47:57.300 --> 01:47:59.860]   So it's probably worth explaining
[01:47:59.860 --> 01:48:02.340]   what a network of wave guides is,
[01:48:02.340 --> 01:48:04.780]   'cause a lot of listeners aren't gonna know that.
[01:48:04.780 --> 01:48:07.140]   Look up the papers by Jeff Chiles on this one.
[01:48:07.140 --> 01:48:11.380]   But basically, light can be guided in a simple,
[01:48:11.380 --> 01:48:14.860]   basically wire of usually an insulating material.
[01:48:14.860 --> 01:48:18.260]   So silicon, silicon nitride,
[01:48:18.260 --> 01:48:20.020]   different kinds of glass,
[01:48:20.020 --> 01:48:23.420]   just like in a fiber optic, it's glass, silicon dioxide.
[01:48:23.420 --> 01:48:24.780]   That makes it a little bit big.
[01:48:24.780 --> 01:48:26.100]   We wanna bring these down.
[01:48:26.100 --> 01:48:28.020]   So we use different materials like silicon nitride,
[01:48:28.020 --> 01:48:32.940]   but basically just imagine a rectangle of some material
[01:48:32.940 --> 01:48:35.540]   that just goes and branches,
[01:48:35.540 --> 01:48:39.940]   forms different branch points
[01:48:39.940 --> 01:48:43.020]   that target different sub regions of the network.
[01:48:43.020 --> 01:48:44.980]   You can transition between layers of these.
[01:48:44.980 --> 01:48:47.140]   So now we're talking about building in the third dimension,
[01:48:47.140 --> 01:48:48.820]   which is absolutely crucial.
[01:48:48.820 --> 01:48:50.700]   So that's what wave guides are.
[01:48:50.700 --> 01:48:52.060]   - Yeah, that's great.
[01:48:52.060 --> 01:48:54.660]   Why the third dimension is crucial?
[01:48:54.660 --> 01:48:56.580]   - Okay, so yes, you were talking about
[01:48:56.580 --> 01:48:58.740]   what are some of the technical limitations.
[01:48:58.740 --> 01:49:04.260]   One of the things that I believe we have to grapple with
[01:49:04.260 --> 01:49:08.740]   is that our brains are miraculously compact.
[01:49:08.740 --> 01:49:11.540]   For the number of neurons that are in our brain,
[01:49:11.540 --> 01:49:13.500]   it sure does fit in a small volume,
[01:49:13.500 --> 01:49:16.180]   as it would have to if we're gonna be biological organisms
[01:49:16.180 --> 01:49:19.220]   that are resource limited and things like that.
[01:49:19.220 --> 01:49:20.940]   Any kind of hardware neuron
[01:49:20.940 --> 01:49:23.420]   is almost certainly gonna be much bigger than that
[01:49:23.420 --> 01:49:26.140]   if it is of comparable complexity,
[01:49:26.140 --> 01:49:28.500]   even whether it's based on silicon transistors.
[01:49:28.500 --> 01:49:30.700]   Okay, a transistor, seven nanometers,
[01:49:30.700 --> 01:49:33.700]   that doesn't mean a semiconductor-based neuron
[01:49:33.700 --> 01:49:34.900]   is seven nanometers.
[01:49:34.900 --> 01:49:35.740]   They're big.
[01:49:35.740 --> 01:49:38.740]   They require many transistors,
[01:49:38.740 --> 01:49:40.260]   different other things like capacitors
[01:49:40.260 --> 01:49:41.540]   and things that store charge.
[01:49:41.540 --> 01:49:44.660]   They end up being on the order of 100 microns
[01:49:44.660 --> 01:49:45.900]   by 100 microns,
[01:49:45.900 --> 01:49:48.260]   and it's difficult to get them down any smaller than that.
[01:49:48.260 --> 01:49:50.860]   The same is true for superconducting neurons,
[01:49:50.860 --> 01:49:52.100]   and the same is true
[01:49:52.100 --> 01:49:54.020]   if we're trying to use light for communication.
[01:49:54.020 --> 01:49:56.860]   Even if you're using electrons for communication,
[01:49:56.860 --> 01:50:00.060]   you have these wires where,
[01:50:00.060 --> 01:50:03.380]   okay, the size of an electron might be angstroms,
[01:50:03.380 --> 01:50:05.580]   but the size of a wire is not angstroms,
[01:50:05.580 --> 01:50:07.140]   and if you try and make it narrower,
[01:50:07.140 --> 01:50:08.500]   the resistance just goes up,
[01:50:08.500 --> 01:50:10.740]   so you don't actually win.
[01:50:10.740 --> 01:50:12.340]   To communicate over long distances,
[01:50:12.340 --> 01:50:15.660]   you need your wires to be microns wide,
[01:50:15.660 --> 01:50:17.180]   and it's the same thing for waveguides.
[01:50:17.180 --> 01:50:18.940]   Waveguides are essentially limited
[01:50:18.940 --> 01:50:20.300]   by the wavelength of light,
[01:50:20.300 --> 01:50:21.900]   and that's gonna be about a micron,
[01:50:21.900 --> 01:50:24.700]   so whereas compare that to an axon,
[01:50:24.700 --> 01:50:26.780]   the analogous component in the brain,
[01:50:26.780 --> 01:50:31.100]   which is 10 nanometers in diameter, something like that,
[01:50:31.100 --> 01:50:33.660]   they're bigger when they need to communicate
[01:50:33.660 --> 01:50:34.620]   over long distances,
[01:50:34.620 --> 01:50:37.980]   but grappling with the size of these structures
[01:50:37.980 --> 01:50:39.820]   is inevitable and crucial,
[01:50:39.820 --> 01:50:43.820]   and so in order to make systems
[01:50:43.820 --> 01:50:46.020]   of comparable scale to the human brain,
[01:50:46.020 --> 01:50:49.820]   by scale here I mean number of interconnected neurons,
[01:50:49.820 --> 01:50:51.740]   you absolutely have to be using
[01:50:51.740 --> 01:50:53.660]   the third spatial dimension,
[01:50:53.660 --> 01:50:55.940]   and that means on the wafer,
[01:50:55.940 --> 01:50:57.380]   you need multiple layers
[01:50:57.380 --> 01:50:59.580]   of both active and passive components.
[01:50:59.580 --> 01:51:03.380]   Active, I mean superconducting electronic circuits
[01:51:03.380 --> 01:51:05.380]   that are performing computations,
[01:51:05.380 --> 01:51:07.380]   and passive, I mean these waveguides
[01:51:07.380 --> 01:51:10.140]   that are routing the optical signals to different places,
[01:51:10.140 --> 01:51:11.700]   you have to be able to stack those.
[01:51:11.700 --> 01:51:15.260]   If you can get to something like 10 planes of each of those,
[01:51:15.260 --> 01:51:18.860]   or maybe not even 10, maybe five, six, something like that,
[01:51:18.860 --> 01:51:19.740]   then you're in business.
[01:51:19.740 --> 01:51:22.860]   Now you can get millions of neurons on a wafer,
[01:51:22.860 --> 01:51:26.380]   but that's not anywhere close to the brain scale.
[01:51:26.380 --> 01:51:27.980]   In order to get to the scale of the human brain,
[01:51:27.980 --> 01:51:30.020]   you're gonna have to also use the third dimension
[01:51:30.020 --> 01:51:32.580]   in the sense that entire wafers
[01:51:32.580 --> 01:51:34.140]   need to be stacked on top of each other
[01:51:34.140 --> 01:51:36.100]   with fiber optic communication between them,
[01:51:36.100 --> 01:51:38.620]   and we need to be able to fill a space
[01:51:38.620 --> 01:51:42.020]   the size of this table with stacked wafers,
[01:51:42.020 --> 01:51:44.260]   and that's when you can get to some 10 billion neurons
[01:51:44.260 --> 01:51:45.100]   like your human brain.
[01:51:45.100 --> 01:51:46.660]   And I don't think that's specific
[01:51:46.660 --> 01:51:48.780]   to the optoelectronic approach that we're taking.
[01:51:48.780 --> 01:51:51.400]   I think that applies to any hardware
[01:51:51.400 --> 01:51:53.540]   where you're trying to reach commensurate scale
[01:51:53.540 --> 01:51:55.020]   and complexity as the human brain.
[01:51:55.020 --> 01:51:57.540]   - So you need that fractal stacking.
[01:51:57.540 --> 01:52:01.100]   So stacking on the wafer, and stacking of the wafers,
[01:52:01.100 --> 01:52:03.820]   and then whatever the system,
[01:52:03.820 --> 01:52:06.380]   this stacking of the tables with the wafers.
[01:52:06.380 --> 01:52:07.700]   - And it has to be fractal all the way.
[01:52:07.700 --> 01:52:10.060]   You're exactly right, because that's the only way
[01:52:10.060 --> 01:52:12.500]   that you can efficiently get information
[01:52:12.500 --> 01:52:15.060]   from a small point to across that whole network.
[01:52:15.060 --> 01:52:17.500]   It has to have the power law connected.
[01:52:17.500 --> 01:52:20.660]   - And photons all like optics throughout.
[01:52:20.660 --> 01:52:21.480]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:52:21.480 --> 01:52:23.700]   Once you're at this scale, to me it's just obvious.
[01:52:23.700 --> 01:52:25.580]   Of course you're using light for communication.
[01:52:25.580 --> 01:52:30.580]   You have fiber optics given to us from nature, so simple.
[01:52:31.660 --> 01:52:33.860]   The thought of even trying to do this,
[01:52:33.860 --> 01:52:37.140]   any kind of electrical communication just doesn't,
[01:52:37.140 --> 01:52:38.100]   it doesn't make sense to me.
[01:52:38.100 --> 01:52:40.220]   I'm not saying it's wrong, I don't know,
[01:52:40.220 --> 01:52:41.820]   but that's where I'm coming from.
[01:52:41.820 --> 01:52:44.800]   - So let's return to loop neurons.
[01:52:44.800 --> 01:52:47.360]   Why are they called loop neurons?
[01:52:47.360 --> 01:52:49.780]   - Yeah, the term loop neurons comes from the fact,
[01:52:49.780 --> 01:52:50.880]   like we've been talking about,
[01:52:50.880 --> 01:52:54.140]   that they rely heavily on these superconducting loops.
[01:52:54.140 --> 01:52:58.340]   So even in a lot of forms of digital computing
[01:52:58.340 --> 01:53:01.980]   as superconductors, storing a signal
[01:53:01.980 --> 01:53:05.900]   in a superconducting loop is a primary technique.
[01:53:05.900 --> 01:53:07.460]   In this particular case,
[01:53:07.460 --> 01:53:09.420]   it's just loops everywhere you look.
[01:53:09.420 --> 01:53:13.580]   So the strength of a synaptic weight is gonna be set
[01:53:13.580 --> 01:53:16.580]   by the amount of current circulating in a loop
[01:53:16.580 --> 01:53:18.620]   that is coupled to the synapse.
[01:53:18.620 --> 01:53:23.300]   So memory is implemented as current circulating
[01:53:23.300 --> 01:53:24.900]   in a superconducting loop.
[01:53:24.900 --> 01:53:27.960]   The coupling between, say, a synapse and a dendrite
[01:53:27.960 --> 01:53:29.940]   or a synapse in the neuron cell body
[01:53:29.940 --> 01:53:33.900]   occurs through loop coupling through transformers.
[01:53:33.900 --> 01:53:35.560]   So current circulating in a synapse
[01:53:35.560 --> 01:53:38.300]   is gonna induce current in a different loop,
[01:53:38.300 --> 01:53:41.540]   a receiving loop in the neuron cell body.
[01:53:41.540 --> 01:53:45.220]   So since all of the computation is happening
[01:53:45.220 --> 01:53:47.420]   in these flux storage loops,
[01:53:47.420 --> 01:53:49.140]   and they play such a central role
[01:53:49.140 --> 01:53:50.980]   in how the information is processed,
[01:53:50.980 --> 01:53:53.560]   how memories are formed, all that stuff,
[01:53:53.560 --> 01:53:54.700]   I didn't think too much about it.
[01:53:54.700 --> 01:53:56.280]   I just called them loop neurons,
[01:53:56.280 --> 01:53:57.940]   'cause it rolls off the tongue a little bit
[01:53:57.940 --> 01:54:01.240]   better than superconducting optoelectronic neurons.
[01:54:01.240 --> 01:54:06.020]   - Okay, so how do you design circuits
[01:54:06.020 --> 01:54:08.540]   for these loop neurons?
[01:54:08.540 --> 01:54:09.740]   - That's a great question.
[01:54:09.740 --> 01:54:12.340]   There's a lot of different scales of design.
[01:54:12.340 --> 01:54:16.360]   So at the level of just one synapse,
[01:54:16.360 --> 01:54:18.980]   you can use conventional methods.
[01:54:18.980 --> 01:54:21.100]   They're not that complicated
[01:54:21.100 --> 01:54:23.220]   as far as superconducting electronics goes.
[01:54:23.220 --> 01:54:27.100]   It's just four Josephson junctions or something like that,
[01:54:27.100 --> 01:54:29.180]   depending on how much complexity you wanna add.
[01:54:29.180 --> 01:54:34.180]   So you can just directly simulate each component in SPICE.
[01:54:34.180 --> 01:54:35.860]   - What's SPICE?
[01:54:35.860 --> 01:54:39.220]   - It's Standard Electrical Simulation Software, basically.
[01:54:39.220 --> 01:54:41.480]   So you're just explicitly solving
[01:54:41.480 --> 01:54:44.340]   the differential equations that describe the circuit elements.
[01:54:44.340 --> 01:54:46.200]   - And then you can stack these things together
[01:54:46.200 --> 01:54:48.860]   in that simulation software to then build circuits.
[01:54:48.860 --> 01:54:51.560]   - You can, but that becomes computationally expensive.
[01:54:51.560 --> 01:54:54.100]   So one of the things, when COVID hit,
[01:54:54.100 --> 01:54:55.760]   we knew we had to turn some attention
[01:54:55.760 --> 01:54:59.380]   to more things you can do at home in your basement
[01:54:59.380 --> 01:55:02.700]   or whatever, and one of them was computational modeling.
[01:55:02.700 --> 01:55:07.700]   So we started working on adapting,
[01:55:07.700 --> 01:55:10.160]   abstracting out the circuit performance
[01:55:10.160 --> 01:55:12.540]   so that you don't have to explicitly solve
[01:55:12.540 --> 01:55:15.860]   the circuit equations, which for Josephson junctions
[01:55:15.860 --> 01:55:18.460]   usually needs to be done on like a picosecond timescale
[01:55:18.460 --> 01:55:21.220]   and you have a lot of nodes in your circuit.
[01:55:21.220 --> 01:55:24.820]   So it results in a lot of differential equations
[01:55:24.820 --> 01:55:26.320]   that need to be solved simultaneously.
[01:55:26.320 --> 01:55:29.400]   We were looking for a way to simulate these circuits
[01:55:29.400 --> 01:55:33.720]   that is scalable up to networks of millions or so neurons
[01:55:33.720 --> 01:55:36.600]   is sort of where we're targeting right now.
[01:55:36.600 --> 01:55:40.780]   So we were able to analyze the behavior of these circuits.
[01:55:40.780 --> 01:55:43.600]   And as I said, it's based on these simple building blocks.
[01:55:43.600 --> 01:55:45.120]   So you really only need to understand
[01:55:45.120 --> 01:55:46.320]   this one building block.
[01:55:46.320 --> 01:55:48.960]   And if you get a good model of that, boom, it tiles.
[01:55:48.960 --> 01:55:51.120]   And you can change the parameters in there
[01:55:51.120 --> 01:55:52.800]   to get different behaviors and stuff,
[01:55:52.800 --> 01:55:56.160]   but it's all based on now it's one differential equation
[01:55:56.160 --> 01:55:57.100]   that you need to solve.
[01:55:57.100 --> 01:56:00.740]   So one differential equation for every synapse,
[01:56:00.740 --> 01:56:03.700]   dendrite or neuron in your system.
[01:56:03.700 --> 01:56:05.300]   And for the neuroscientists out there,
[01:56:05.300 --> 01:56:08.380]   it's just a simple leaky integrate and fire model,
[01:56:08.380 --> 01:56:09.940]   leaky integrator basically.
[01:56:09.940 --> 01:56:11.820]   The synapse is a leaky integrator,
[01:56:11.820 --> 01:56:13.420]   a dendrite is a leaky integrator.
[01:56:13.420 --> 01:56:18.420]   So I'm really fascinated by how this one simple component
[01:56:18.420 --> 01:56:22.200]   can be used to achieve lots of different types
[01:56:22.200 --> 01:56:24.420]   of dynamical activity.
[01:56:24.420 --> 01:56:27.540]   And to me, that's where scalability comes from.
[01:56:27.540 --> 01:56:29.180]   And also complexity as well.
[01:56:29.180 --> 01:56:30.880]   Complexity is often characterized
[01:56:30.880 --> 01:56:35.420]   by relatively simple building blocks
[01:56:35.420 --> 01:56:37.820]   connected in potentially simple
[01:56:37.820 --> 01:56:39.360]   or sometimes complicated ways
[01:56:39.360 --> 01:56:41.940]   and then emergent new behavior that was hard to predict
[01:56:41.940 --> 01:56:44.700]   from those simple elements.
[01:56:44.700 --> 01:56:46.620]   And that's exactly what we're working with here.
[01:56:46.620 --> 01:56:49.040]   So it's a very exciting platform,
[01:56:49.040 --> 01:56:50.380]   both from a modeling perspective
[01:56:50.380 --> 01:56:52.740]   and from a hardware manifestation perspective
[01:56:52.740 --> 01:56:57.360]   where we can hopefully start to have this test bed
[01:56:57.360 --> 01:56:58.860]   where we can explore things,
[01:56:58.860 --> 01:57:00.820]   not just related to neuroscience,
[01:57:00.820 --> 01:57:03.500]   but also related to other things
[01:57:03.500 --> 01:57:07.140]   that connected to other physics like critical phenomenon,
[01:57:07.140 --> 01:57:08.660]   Ising models, things like that.
[01:57:08.660 --> 01:57:13.060]   So you were asking how we simulate these circuits.
[01:57:13.060 --> 01:57:14.540]   It's at different levels
[01:57:14.540 --> 01:57:18.340]   and we've got the simple spice circuit stuff.
[01:57:18.340 --> 01:57:19.540]   That's no problem.
[01:57:19.540 --> 01:57:21.740]   And now we're building these network models
[01:57:21.740 --> 01:57:23.620]   based on this more efficient leaky integrator.
[01:57:23.620 --> 01:57:26.220]   So we can actually reduce every element
[01:57:26.220 --> 01:57:27.460]   to one differential equation.
[01:57:27.460 --> 01:57:28.860]   And then we can also step through it
[01:57:28.860 --> 01:57:30.700]   on a much coarser time grid.
[01:57:30.700 --> 01:57:32.380]   So it ends up being something like a factor
[01:57:32.380 --> 01:57:35.380]   of a thousand to 10,000 speed improvement,
[01:57:35.380 --> 01:57:37.760]   which allows us to simulate,
[01:57:37.760 --> 01:57:40.520]   but hopefully up to millions of neurons.
[01:57:40.520 --> 01:57:42.780]   Whereas before we would have been limited
[01:57:42.780 --> 01:57:45.780]   to tens, a hundred, something like that.
[01:57:45.780 --> 01:57:48.820]   - And just like simulating quantum mechanical systems
[01:57:48.820 --> 01:57:49.860]   with a quantum computer.
[01:57:49.860 --> 01:57:53.380]   So the goal here is to understand such systems.
[01:57:53.380 --> 01:57:55.900]   - For me, the goal is to study this
[01:57:55.900 --> 01:57:58.940]   as a scientific physical system.
[01:57:58.940 --> 01:58:02.780]   I'm not drawn towards turning this into an enterprise
[01:58:02.780 --> 01:58:03.620]   at this point.
[01:58:03.620 --> 01:58:04.440]   I feel-
[01:58:04.440 --> 01:58:07.460]   - Short-term applications that obviously make a lot of money
[01:58:07.460 --> 01:58:10.500]   is not necessarily a curiosity driver
[01:58:10.500 --> 01:58:11.400]   for you at the moment.
[01:58:11.400 --> 01:58:12.240]   - Absolutely not.
[01:58:12.240 --> 01:58:14.020]   If you're interested in short-term making money,
[01:58:14.020 --> 01:58:16.500]   go with deep learning, use silicon microelectronics.
[01:58:16.500 --> 01:58:20.880]   If you wanna understand things like the physics
[01:58:20.880 --> 01:58:23.020]   of a fascinating system,
[01:58:23.020 --> 01:58:26.220]   or if you wanna understand something more along the lines
[01:58:26.220 --> 01:58:29.480]   of the physical limits of what can be achieved,
[01:58:29.480 --> 01:58:32.680]   then I think single photon communication,
[01:58:32.680 --> 01:58:35.940]   superconducting electronics, extremely exciting.
[01:58:35.940 --> 01:58:39.620]   - What if I wanna use superconducting hardware
[01:58:39.620 --> 01:58:42.020]   at four Kelvin to mine Bitcoin?
[01:58:42.020 --> 01:58:43.260]   That's my main interest.
[01:58:43.260 --> 01:58:45.860]   That's the reason I wanted to talk to you today.
[01:58:45.860 --> 01:58:47.620]   I wanna, no, I don't know.
[01:58:47.620 --> 01:58:48.620]   - What's Bitcoin?
[01:58:48.620 --> 01:58:50.300]   (Lex laughing)
[01:58:50.300 --> 01:58:53.140]   - It's a, look it up on the internet.
[01:58:53.140 --> 01:58:54.780]   Somebody told me about it.
[01:58:54.780 --> 01:58:56.380]   I'm not sure exactly what it is.
[01:58:56.380 --> 01:58:59.060]   But let me ask nevertheless
[01:58:59.060 --> 01:59:01.500]   about applications to machine learning.
[01:59:01.500 --> 01:59:02.340]   - Okay.
[01:59:02.340 --> 01:59:07.340]   - So what, like if you look at the scale of five, 10, 20 years
[01:59:07.340 --> 01:59:12.100]   is it possible to, before we understand the nature
[01:59:12.100 --> 01:59:14.620]   of human intelligence and general intelligence,
[01:59:14.620 --> 01:59:19.260]   do you think we'll start falling out of this exploration
[01:59:19.260 --> 01:59:23.260]   of neuromorphic systems ability to solve some
[01:59:23.260 --> 01:59:25.360]   of the problems that the machine learning systems
[01:59:25.360 --> 01:59:26.580]   of today can't solve?
[01:59:26.580 --> 01:59:31.620]   - I'm really hesitant to over promise.
[01:59:31.620 --> 01:59:34.140]   So I really don't know.
[01:59:34.140 --> 01:59:36.780]   Also, I don't really understand machine learning
[01:59:36.780 --> 01:59:37.600]   in a lot of senses.
[01:59:37.600 --> 01:59:42.480]   I mean, machine learning from my perspective
[01:59:42.480 --> 01:59:47.420]   appears to require that you know precisely
[01:59:47.420 --> 01:59:51.740]   what your input is and also what your goal is.
[01:59:51.740 --> 01:59:53.340]   You usually have some objective function
[01:59:53.340 --> 01:59:54.180]   or something like that.
[01:59:54.180 --> 01:59:57.300]   And that's just, that's very limiting.
[01:59:57.300 --> 02:00:00.180]   I mean, of course, a lot of times that's the case,
[02:00:00.180 --> 02:00:03.100]   you know, there's a picture and there's a horse in it,
[02:00:03.100 --> 02:00:03.940]   so you're done.
[02:00:03.940 --> 02:00:06.520]   But that's not a very interesting problem.
[02:00:06.520 --> 02:00:09.500]   I think when I think about intelligence,
[02:00:09.500 --> 02:00:13.200]   it's almost defined by the ability to handle problems
[02:00:13.200 --> 02:00:15.960]   where you don't know what your inputs are going to be
[02:00:15.960 --> 02:00:17.400]   and you don't even necessarily know
[02:00:17.400 --> 02:00:18.600]   what you're trying to accomplish.
[02:00:18.600 --> 02:00:21.640]   I mean, I'm not sure what I'm trying to accomplish
[02:00:21.640 --> 02:00:22.560]   in this world.
[02:00:22.560 --> 02:00:24.560]   - Yeah, at all scales.
[02:00:24.560 --> 02:00:25.920]   - Yeah, at all scales, right.
[02:00:25.920 --> 02:00:29.400]   I mean, so it's sometimes, so I'm more drawn
[02:00:29.400 --> 02:00:33.720]   to the underlying phenomena,
[02:00:33.720 --> 02:00:37.960]   the critical dynamics of this system,
[02:00:37.960 --> 02:00:41.340]   trying to understand how elements
[02:00:41.340 --> 02:00:43.620]   that you build into your hardware
[02:00:43.620 --> 02:00:48.620]   result in emergent, fascinating activity
[02:00:48.620 --> 02:00:51.740]   that was very difficult to predict, things like that.
[02:00:51.740 --> 02:00:53.620]   So, but I gotta be really careful
[02:00:53.620 --> 02:00:55.540]   because I think a lot of other people who,
[02:00:55.540 --> 02:00:57.660]   if they found themselves working on this project
[02:00:57.660 --> 02:00:59.260]   in my shoes, they would say, all right,
[02:00:59.260 --> 02:01:01.620]   what are all the different ways we can use this
[02:01:01.620 --> 02:01:02.460]   for machine learning?
[02:01:02.460 --> 02:01:04.860]   Actually, let me just definitely mention
[02:01:04.860 --> 02:01:06.620]   colleague at NIST, Mike Schneider.
[02:01:06.620 --> 02:01:09.300]   He's also very much interested,
[02:01:09.300 --> 02:01:11.680]   particularly in the superconducting side of things,
[02:01:11.680 --> 02:01:14.880]   using the incredible speed, power efficiency,
[02:01:14.880 --> 02:01:17.680]   also Ken Segal at Colgate, other people working
[02:01:17.680 --> 02:01:20.480]   on specifically the superconducting side of this
[02:01:20.480 --> 02:01:25.040]   for machine learning and deep feed-forward neural networks.
[02:01:25.040 --> 02:01:27.360]   There, the advantages are obvious.
[02:01:27.360 --> 02:01:28.760]   It's extremely fast.
[02:01:28.760 --> 02:01:31.840]   - Yeah, so that's less on the nature of intelligence
[02:01:31.840 --> 02:01:35.720]   and more on various characteristics of this hardware.
[02:01:35.720 --> 02:01:37.040]   - Right, yes, absolutely. - That you can use
[02:01:37.040 --> 02:01:39.440]   for the basic computations we know today.
[02:01:39.440 --> 02:01:40.640]   - Yeah, one of the things-- - And communication.
[02:01:40.640 --> 02:01:42.280]   - One of the things that Mike Schneider's working on
[02:01:42.280 --> 02:01:44.640]   right now is an image classifier.
[02:01:44.640 --> 02:01:47.040]   At a relatively small scale, I think he's targeting
[02:01:47.040 --> 02:01:48.800]   that nine pixel problem where you can have
[02:01:48.800 --> 02:01:52.340]   three different characters and you just,
[02:01:52.340 --> 02:01:54.880]   you put in a nine pixel image and you classify it
[02:01:54.880 --> 02:01:58.400]   as one of these three categories.
[02:01:58.400 --> 02:02:00.120]   And that's gonna be really interesting
[02:02:00.120 --> 02:02:04.160]   to see what happens there because if you can show
[02:02:04.160 --> 02:02:06.940]   that even at that scale, you just put these images in
[02:02:06.940 --> 02:02:09.520]   and you get it out and he thinks he can do it.
[02:02:09.520 --> 02:02:11.160]   I forgot if it's a nanosecond
[02:02:11.160 --> 02:02:14.000]   or some extremely fast classification time.
[02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.360]   It's probably less, it's probably 100 picoseconds
[02:02:16.360 --> 02:02:17.400]   or something.
[02:02:17.400 --> 02:02:18.800]   There you have challenges though
[02:02:18.800 --> 02:02:21.560]   because the Josephson junctions themselves,
[02:02:21.560 --> 02:02:24.520]   the electronic circuit is extremely power efficient.
[02:02:24.520 --> 02:02:26.840]   Some orders of magnitude for something more
[02:02:26.840 --> 02:02:29.240]   than a transistor doing the same thing.
[02:02:29.240 --> 02:02:31.440]   But when you have to cool it down to four Kelvin,
[02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:33.860]   you pay a huge overhead just for keeping it cold,
[02:02:33.860 --> 02:02:35.240]   even if it's not doing anything.
[02:02:35.240 --> 02:02:40.240]   So it has to work at large scale
[02:02:40.240 --> 02:02:43.680]   in order to overcome that power penalty,
[02:02:43.680 --> 02:02:45.120]   but that's possible.
[02:02:45.120 --> 02:02:48.000]   It's just, it's gonna have to get that performance.
[02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:49.720]   And this is sort of what you were asking about before
[02:02:49.720 --> 02:02:52.760]   is like how much better than silicon would it need to be?
[02:02:52.760 --> 02:02:54.120]   And the answer is, I don't know.
[02:02:54.120 --> 02:02:57.240]   I think if it's just overall better than silicon
[02:02:57.240 --> 02:03:00.200]   at a problem that a lot of people care about,
[02:03:00.200 --> 02:03:02.640]   maybe it's image classification,
[02:03:02.640 --> 02:03:03.960]   maybe it's face recognition,
[02:03:03.960 --> 02:03:07.540]   maybe it's monitoring credit transactions, I don't know.
[02:03:07.540 --> 02:03:09.000]   Then I think it will have a place.
[02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:10.440]   It's not gonna be in your cell phone,
[02:03:10.440 --> 02:03:12.240]   but it could be in your data center.
[02:03:12.240 --> 02:03:16.160]   - So what about in terms of the data center?
[02:03:16.160 --> 02:03:17.680]   I don't know if you're paying attention
[02:03:17.680 --> 02:03:22.680]   to the various systems like Tesla recently announced DOJO,
[02:03:22.680 --> 02:03:27.160]   which is a large scale machine learning training system.
[02:03:27.160 --> 02:03:28.940]   That again, the bottleneck there
[02:03:28.940 --> 02:03:30.920]   is probably going to be communication
[02:03:30.920 --> 02:03:32.800]   between those systems.
[02:03:32.800 --> 02:03:34.880]   Is there something from your work
[02:03:34.880 --> 02:03:39.120]   on everything we've been talking about
[02:03:39.120 --> 02:03:41.640]   in terms of superconductive hardware
[02:03:41.640 --> 02:03:43.520]   that could be useful there?
[02:03:43.520 --> 02:03:45.360]   - Oh, I mean, okay.
[02:03:45.360 --> 02:03:46.720]   Tomorrow, no.
[02:03:46.720 --> 02:03:49.000]   In the long term, it could be the whole thing.
[02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:49.840]   It could be nothing.
[02:03:49.840 --> 02:03:52.120]   I don't know, but definitely, definitely.
[02:03:52.120 --> 02:03:55.160]   When you look at the,
[02:03:55.160 --> 02:03:56.720]   so I don't know that much about DOJO.
[02:03:56.720 --> 02:03:58.820]   My understanding is that that's new, right?
[02:03:58.820 --> 02:04:01.320]   That's just coming online.
[02:04:01.320 --> 02:04:03.940]   - Well, I don't even know where.
[02:04:03.940 --> 02:04:06.960]   It hasn't come online.
[02:04:06.960 --> 02:04:09.560]   And when you announce big, sexy,
[02:04:09.560 --> 02:04:12.040]   so let me explain to you the way things work in--
[02:04:12.040 --> 02:04:13.160]   - In the world out there.
[02:04:13.160 --> 02:04:15.680]   - In the world of business and marketing,
[02:04:15.680 --> 02:04:18.400]   it's not always clear where you are
[02:04:18.400 --> 02:04:20.560]   on the coming online part of that.
[02:04:20.560 --> 02:04:22.680]   So I don't know where they are exactly,
[02:04:22.680 --> 02:04:26.440]   but the vision is from ground up to build up
[02:04:26.440 --> 02:04:31.080]   a very, very large scale modular machine learning ASIC,
[02:04:31.080 --> 02:04:32.640]   basically hardware that's optimized
[02:04:32.640 --> 02:04:34.120]   for training neural networks.
[02:04:34.120 --> 02:04:36.060]   And of course, there's a lot of companies
[02:04:36.060 --> 02:04:39.360]   that are small and big working on this kind of problem.
[02:04:39.360 --> 02:04:42.680]   The question is how to do it in a modular way
[02:04:42.680 --> 02:04:45.640]   that has very fast communication.
[02:04:45.640 --> 02:04:49.520]   The interesting aspect of Tesla is you have a company
[02:04:49.520 --> 02:04:54.520]   that, at least at this time, is so singularly focused
[02:04:54.660 --> 02:04:57.740]   on solving a particular machine learning problem
[02:04:57.740 --> 02:05:00.900]   and is making obviously a lot of money doing so
[02:05:00.900 --> 02:05:02.220]   because the machine learning problem
[02:05:02.220 --> 02:05:05.180]   happens to be involved with autonomous driving.
[02:05:05.180 --> 02:05:09.780]   And so you have a system that's driven by an application.
[02:05:09.780 --> 02:05:14.780]   And that's really interesting because you have maybe Google
[02:05:14.780 --> 02:05:17.740]   working on TPUs and so on.
[02:05:17.740 --> 02:05:21.460]   You have all these other companies with ASICs.
[02:05:21.460 --> 02:05:25.980]   They're usually more kind of always thinking general.
[02:05:25.980 --> 02:05:29.180]   So I like it when it's driven by a particular application
[02:05:29.180 --> 02:05:32.220]   because then you can really get to the,
[02:05:32.220 --> 02:05:34.940]   it's like, it's somehow,
[02:05:34.940 --> 02:05:37.300]   if you just talk broadly about intelligence,
[02:05:37.300 --> 02:05:40.300]   you may not always get to the right solutions.
[02:05:40.300 --> 02:05:42.820]   It's nice to couple that sometimes with specific,
[02:05:42.820 --> 02:05:46.140]   clear illustration of something
[02:05:46.140 --> 02:05:47.680]   that requires general intelligence,
[02:05:47.680 --> 02:05:49.900]   which for me, driving is one such case.
[02:05:49.900 --> 02:05:51.140]   - I think you're exactly right.
[02:05:51.140 --> 02:05:54.420]   Sometimes just having that focus on that application
[02:05:54.420 --> 02:05:55.900]   brings a lot of people focus
[02:05:55.900 --> 02:05:57.700]   as their energy and attention.
[02:05:57.700 --> 02:06:00.220]   I think that, so one of the things that's appealing
[02:06:00.220 --> 02:06:02.460]   about what you're saying is not just
[02:06:02.460 --> 02:06:03.900]   that the application is specific,
[02:06:03.900 --> 02:06:05.700]   but also that the scale is big.
[02:06:05.700 --> 02:06:06.540]   - Big.
[02:06:06.540 --> 02:06:10.660]   - And that the benefit is also huge.
[02:06:10.660 --> 02:06:12.340]   - Financial anti-humanity.
[02:06:12.340 --> 02:06:13.180]   - Right, right, right.
[02:06:13.180 --> 02:06:15.520]   Yeah, so I guess, let me just try to understand,
[02:06:15.520 --> 02:06:17.980]   is the point of this Dojo system
[02:06:17.980 --> 02:06:21.860]   to figure out the parameters
[02:06:21.860 --> 02:06:23.860]   that then plug into neural networks
[02:06:23.860 --> 02:06:26.500]   and then you don't need to retrain,
[02:06:26.500 --> 02:06:29.060]   you just make copies of a certain chip
[02:06:29.060 --> 02:06:32.320]   that has all the parameters established or?
[02:06:32.320 --> 02:06:36.740]   - No, it's straight up retraining a large neural network
[02:06:36.740 --> 02:06:38.580]   over and over and over.
[02:06:38.580 --> 02:06:41.660]   - So you have to do it once for every new car?
[02:06:41.660 --> 02:06:43.120]   - No, no, no, you have to,
[02:06:43.120 --> 02:06:44.820]   so they do this interesting process,
[02:06:44.820 --> 02:06:47.020]   which I think is a process for machine learning,
[02:06:47.020 --> 02:06:49.260]   supervised machine learning systems,
[02:06:49.260 --> 02:06:50.740]   you're going to have to do,
[02:06:50.740 --> 02:06:53.700]   which is you have a system,
[02:06:53.700 --> 02:06:55.140]   you train your network once,
[02:06:55.140 --> 02:06:57.140]   it takes a long time, I don't know how long,
[02:06:57.140 --> 02:06:59.720]   but maybe a week to train.
[02:06:59.720 --> 02:07:03.180]   And then you deploy it on,
[02:07:03.180 --> 02:07:05.020]   let's say about a million cars,
[02:07:05.020 --> 02:07:05.860]   I don't know what the number is.
[02:07:05.860 --> 02:07:07.820]   - But that part you just write software
[02:07:07.820 --> 02:07:10.660]   that updates some weights in a table and yeah, okay.
[02:07:10.660 --> 02:07:12.620]   - But there's a loop back.
[02:07:12.620 --> 02:07:13.460]   - Yeah, yeah, okay.
[02:07:13.460 --> 02:07:17.260]   - And each of those cars run into trouble rarely,
[02:07:17.260 --> 02:07:23.700]   but like they catch the edge cases
[02:07:23.700 --> 02:07:26.060]   of the performance of that particular system
[02:07:26.060 --> 02:07:28.300]   and then send that data back
[02:07:28.300 --> 02:07:31.420]   and either automatically or by humans
[02:07:31.420 --> 02:07:34.740]   that weird edge case data is annotated
[02:07:34.740 --> 02:07:37.540]   and then the network has to become smart enough
[02:07:37.540 --> 02:07:40.140]   to now be able to perform in those edge cases
[02:07:40.140 --> 02:07:41.820]   so it has to get retrained.
[02:07:41.820 --> 02:07:43.980]   There's clever ways of retraining different parts
[02:07:43.980 --> 02:07:46.260]   of that network, but for the most part,
[02:07:46.260 --> 02:07:49.300]   I think they prefer to retrain the entire thing.
[02:07:49.300 --> 02:07:51.340]   So you have this giant monster
[02:07:51.340 --> 02:07:54.900]   that kind of has to be retrained regularly.
[02:07:54.900 --> 02:07:58.580]   I think the vision with Dojo
[02:07:58.580 --> 02:08:02.300]   is to have a very large machine learning focused,
[02:08:02.300 --> 02:08:05.180]   driving focused supercomputer
[02:08:05.180 --> 02:08:07.580]   that then is sufficiently modular
[02:08:07.580 --> 02:08:08.460]   that could be scaled
[02:08:08.460 --> 02:08:10.340]   to other machine learning applications.
[02:08:10.340 --> 02:08:12.740]   But like, so they're not limiting themselves completely
[02:08:12.740 --> 02:08:13.980]   to this particular application,
[02:08:13.980 --> 02:08:16.180]   but is this application is the way
[02:08:16.180 --> 02:08:18.980]   they kind of test this iterative process
[02:08:18.980 --> 02:08:21.500]   of machine learning is you make a system
[02:08:21.500 --> 02:08:25.140]   that's very dumb, deploy it,
[02:08:25.140 --> 02:08:27.180]   get the edge cases where it fails,
[02:08:27.180 --> 02:08:28.340]   make it a little smarter,
[02:08:28.340 --> 02:08:29.980]   it becomes a little less dumb
[02:08:29.980 --> 02:08:32.980]   and that iterative process achieves something
[02:08:32.980 --> 02:08:34.540]   that you can call intelligent
[02:08:34.540 --> 02:08:36.460]   or is smart enough to be able
[02:08:36.460 --> 02:08:37.980]   to solve this particular application.
[02:08:37.980 --> 02:08:42.980]   So it has to do with training neural networks fast
[02:08:42.980 --> 02:08:45.940]   and training neural networks that are large.
[02:08:45.940 --> 02:08:48.540]   - But also based on an extraordinary amount
[02:08:48.540 --> 02:08:49.900]   of diverse input.
[02:08:49.900 --> 02:08:50.740]   - Data, yeah.
[02:08:50.740 --> 02:08:51.900]   - And that's one of the things,
[02:08:51.900 --> 02:08:54.540]   so this does seem like one of those spaces
[02:08:54.540 --> 02:08:58.940]   where the scale of superconducting optoelectronics,
[02:08:58.940 --> 02:09:02.540]   the way that, so when you talk about the weaknesses,
[02:09:02.540 --> 02:09:04.140]   like I said, okay, well, you have to cool it down.
[02:09:04.140 --> 02:09:05.780]   At this scale, that's fine.
[02:09:05.780 --> 02:09:09.460]   Because that's not too much of an added cost.
[02:09:09.460 --> 02:09:10.980]   Most of your power is being dissipated
[02:09:10.980 --> 02:09:12.980]   by the circuits themselves, not the cooling.
[02:09:12.980 --> 02:09:17.980]   And also you have one centralized kind of cognitive hub,
[02:09:17.980 --> 02:09:20.780]   if you will.
[02:09:20.780 --> 02:09:24.340]   And so when, if we're talking about putting
[02:09:24.340 --> 02:09:28.620]   a superconducting system in a car, that's questionable.
[02:09:28.620 --> 02:09:30.660]   Do you really want a cryostat in the trunk
[02:09:30.660 --> 02:09:31.500]   of every one of your car?
[02:09:31.500 --> 02:09:32.900]   It'll fit, it's not that big of a deal,
[02:09:32.900 --> 02:09:35.700]   but hopefully there's a better way, right?
[02:09:35.700 --> 02:09:39.060]   But since this is sort of a central supreme intelligence
[02:09:39.060 --> 02:09:42.600]   or something like that, and it needs to really have
[02:09:42.600 --> 02:09:47.100]   this massive data acquisition, massive data integration,
[02:09:47.100 --> 02:09:49.140]   I would think that that's where large-scale
[02:09:49.140 --> 02:09:51.260]   spiking neural networks with vast communication
[02:09:51.260 --> 02:09:53.140]   and all these things would have something
[02:09:53.140 --> 02:09:54.260]   pretty tremendous to offer.
[02:09:54.260 --> 02:09:55.740]   It's not gonna happen tomorrow.
[02:09:55.740 --> 02:09:58.240]   There's a lot of development that needs to be done.
[02:09:58.240 --> 02:10:01.420]   But we have to be patient with self-driving cars
[02:10:01.420 --> 02:10:02.260]   for a lot of reasons.
[02:10:02.260 --> 02:10:04.580]   We were all optimistic that they would be here by now.
[02:10:04.580 --> 02:10:06.460]   And okay, they are to some extent,
[02:10:06.460 --> 02:10:09.540]   but if we're thinking five or 10 years down the line,
[02:10:09.540 --> 02:10:12.060]   it's not unreasonable.
[02:10:12.060 --> 02:10:14.780]   One other thing, let me just mention
[02:10:14.780 --> 02:10:17.380]   that getting into self-driving cars and technologies
[02:10:17.380 --> 02:10:19.700]   that are using AI out in the world,
[02:10:19.700 --> 02:10:21.520]   this is something NIST cares a lot about.
[02:10:21.520 --> 02:10:25.020]   Elham Tabassi is leading up a much larger effort
[02:10:25.020 --> 02:10:29.320]   in AI at NIST than my little project.
[02:10:29.320 --> 02:10:32.700]   And really central to that mission
[02:10:32.700 --> 02:10:35.020]   is this concept of trustworthiness.
[02:10:35.020 --> 02:10:38.900]   So when you're going to deploy this neural network
[02:10:38.900 --> 02:10:43.340]   in every single automobile with so much on the line,
[02:10:43.340 --> 02:10:45.260]   you have to be able to trust that.
[02:10:45.260 --> 02:10:48.020]   So now how do we know that we can trust that?
[02:10:48.020 --> 02:10:50.100]   How do we know that we can trust the self-driving car
[02:10:50.100 --> 02:10:53.700]   or the supercomputer that trained it?
[02:10:53.700 --> 02:10:54.820]   There's a lot of work there
[02:10:54.820 --> 02:10:56.980]   and there's a lot of that going on at NIST.
[02:10:56.980 --> 02:10:58.200]   And it's still early days.
[02:10:58.200 --> 02:11:01.820]   I mean, you're familiar with the problem and all that.
[02:11:01.820 --> 02:11:04.460]   But there's a fascinating dance in engineering
[02:11:04.460 --> 02:11:06.700]   with like safety critical systems.
[02:11:06.700 --> 02:11:08.820]   There's a desire in computer science,
[02:11:08.820 --> 02:11:10.620]   just recently talked to Don Knuth,
[02:11:10.620 --> 02:11:14.800]   for algorithms and for systems,
[02:11:14.800 --> 02:11:17.440]   for them to be provably correct or provably safe.
[02:11:17.440 --> 02:11:20.300]   And this is one other difference
[02:11:20.300 --> 02:11:22.340]   between humans and biological systems
[02:11:22.340 --> 02:11:24.860]   is we're not provably anything.
[02:11:24.860 --> 02:11:29.760]   And so there's some aspect of imperfection
[02:11:29.760 --> 02:11:32.180]   that we need to have built in,
[02:11:32.180 --> 02:11:37.180]   like robustness to imperfection, be part of our systems,
[02:11:37.180 --> 02:11:40.700]   which is a difficult thing for engineers to contend with.
[02:11:40.700 --> 02:11:42.820]   They're very uncomfortable with the idea
[02:11:42.820 --> 02:11:46.900]   that you have to be okay with failure
[02:11:46.900 --> 02:11:49.740]   and almost engineer failure into the system.
[02:11:49.740 --> 02:11:51.020]   - Mathematicians hate it too.
[02:11:51.020 --> 02:11:53.660]   But I think it was Turing who said something
[02:11:53.660 --> 02:11:57.100]   along the lines of, I can give you an intelligent system
[02:11:57.100 --> 02:11:59.540]   or I can give you a flawless system,
[02:11:59.540 --> 02:12:00.900]   but I can't give you both.
[02:12:00.900 --> 02:12:04.140]   And it's in sort of creativity and abstract thinking
[02:12:04.140 --> 02:12:07.860]   seem to rely somewhat on stochasticity
[02:12:07.860 --> 02:12:11.360]   and not having components
[02:12:11.360 --> 02:12:13.780]   that perform exactly the same way every time.
[02:12:13.780 --> 02:12:16.020]   - This is where like the disagreement I have with,
[02:12:16.020 --> 02:12:18.580]   not disagreement, but a different view on the world.
[02:12:18.580 --> 02:12:19.700]   I'm with Turing.
[02:12:19.700 --> 02:12:24.620]   When I talk to robotic, robot colleagues,
[02:12:24.620 --> 02:12:26.460]   that sounds like I'm talking to robots,
[02:12:26.460 --> 02:12:31.460]   colleagues that are roboticists, the goal is perfection.
[02:12:31.460 --> 02:12:36.660]   And to me is like, no, I think the goal should be
[02:12:36.660 --> 02:12:40.980]   imperfection that's communicated.
[02:12:40.980 --> 02:12:44.180]   And through the interaction between humans and robots,
[02:12:44.180 --> 02:12:49.180]   that imperfection becomes a feature, not a bug.
[02:12:49.180 --> 02:12:52.180]   Like together as a scene, as a system,
[02:12:52.180 --> 02:12:53.700]   the human and the robot together
[02:12:53.740 --> 02:12:56.420]   are better than either of them individually,
[02:12:56.420 --> 02:13:00.580]   but the robot itself is not perfect in any way.
[02:13:00.580 --> 02:13:02.780]   Of course, there's a bunch of disagreements,
[02:13:02.780 --> 02:13:04.940]   including with Mr. Elon about,
[02:13:04.940 --> 02:13:08.700]   to me autonomous driving is fundamentally
[02:13:08.700 --> 02:13:12.380]   a human robot interaction problem, not a robotics problem.
[02:13:12.380 --> 02:13:14.340]   To Elon, it's a robotics problem.
[02:13:14.340 --> 02:13:18.620]   That's actually an open and fascinating question,
[02:13:18.620 --> 02:13:21.700]   whether humans can be removed from the loop completely.
[02:13:22.300 --> 02:13:24.460]   (inhales)
[02:13:24.460 --> 02:13:27.700]   We've talked about a lot of fascinating chemistry
[02:13:27.700 --> 02:13:31.260]   and physics and engineering,
[02:13:31.260 --> 02:13:33.700]   and we're always running up against this issue
[02:13:33.700 --> 02:13:37.580]   that nature seems to dictate what's easy and what's hard.
[02:13:37.580 --> 02:13:40.100]   So you have this cool little paper
[02:13:40.100 --> 02:13:42.760]   that I'd love to just ask you about.
[02:13:42.760 --> 02:13:44.500]   It's titled,
[02:13:44.500 --> 02:13:48.180]   "Does Cosmological Evolution Select for Technology?"
[02:13:48.180 --> 02:13:53.180]   So in physics, there's parameters
[02:13:53.180 --> 02:13:56.220]   that seem to define the way our universe works,
[02:13:56.220 --> 02:13:59.340]   that physics works, that if it worked any differently,
[02:13:59.340 --> 02:14:01.740]   we would get a very different world.
[02:14:01.740 --> 02:14:04.220]   So it seems like the parameters are very fine tuned
[02:14:04.220 --> 02:14:06.460]   to the kind of physics that we see.
[02:14:06.460 --> 02:14:08.580]   All the beautiful E equals MC squared,
[02:14:08.580 --> 02:14:10.420]   that we get these nice, beautiful laws.
[02:14:10.420 --> 02:14:13.140]   It seems like very fine tuned for that.
[02:14:13.140 --> 02:14:16.820]   So what you argue in this article is,
[02:14:16.820 --> 02:14:20.580]   it may be that the universe has also fine tuned
[02:14:20.580 --> 02:14:24.340]   its parameters that enable the kind
[02:14:24.340 --> 02:14:27.280]   of technological innovation that we see,
[02:14:27.280 --> 02:14:29.580]   that technology that we see.
[02:14:29.580 --> 02:14:31.500]   Can you explain this idea?
[02:14:31.500 --> 02:14:33.420]   - Yeah, I think you've introduced it nicely.
[02:14:33.420 --> 02:14:38.420]   Let me just try to say a few things in my language.
[02:14:38.420 --> 02:14:41.660]   Leah, what is this fine tuning problem?
[02:14:41.660 --> 02:14:46.540]   So physicists have spent centuries trying to understand
[02:14:46.540 --> 02:14:51.540]   the system of equations that govern the way nature behaves,
[02:14:51.540 --> 02:14:55.060]   the way particles move and interact with each other.
[02:14:55.060 --> 02:15:00.060]   And as that understanding has become more clear over time,
[02:15:00.060 --> 02:15:05.820]   it became sort of evident that it's all well adjusted
[02:15:05.820 --> 02:15:12.680]   to allow a universe like we see, very complex,
[02:15:13.060 --> 02:15:16.500]   this large long lived universe.
[02:15:16.500 --> 02:15:19.960]   And so one answer to that is, well, of course it is,
[02:15:19.960 --> 02:15:21.540]   because we wouldn't be here otherwise.
[02:15:21.540 --> 02:15:24.420]   But I don't know, that's not very satisfying.
[02:15:24.420 --> 02:15:25.600]   That's sort of, that's what's known
[02:15:25.600 --> 02:15:27.260]   as the weak anthropic principle.
[02:15:27.260 --> 02:15:29.220]   It's a statement of selection bias.
[02:15:29.220 --> 02:15:33.660]   We can only observe a universe that is fit for us to live in.
[02:15:33.660 --> 02:15:35.000]   So what does it mean for a universe
[02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:36.140]   to be fit for us to live in?
[02:15:36.140 --> 02:15:38.420]   Well, the pursuit of physics,
[02:15:38.420 --> 02:15:42.620]   it is based partially on coming up with equations
[02:15:42.620 --> 02:15:44.660]   that describe how things behave
[02:15:44.660 --> 02:15:46.340]   and interact with each other.
[02:15:46.340 --> 02:15:48.520]   But in all those equations you have,
[02:15:48.520 --> 02:15:49.980]   so there's the form of the equation,
[02:15:49.980 --> 02:15:54.240]   sort of how different fields or particles
[02:15:54.240 --> 02:15:56.500]   move in space and time.
[02:15:56.500 --> 02:15:58.520]   But then there are also the parameters
[02:15:58.520 --> 02:16:01.140]   that just tell you sort of the strength
[02:16:01.140 --> 02:16:05.200]   of different couplings, how strongly does a charged particle
[02:16:05.200 --> 02:16:07.660]   couple to the electromagnetic field or masses?
[02:16:07.660 --> 02:16:11.540]   How strongly does a particle couple to the Higgs field
[02:16:11.540 --> 02:16:13.000]   or something like that?
[02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:16.980]   And those parameters that define,
[02:16:16.980 --> 02:16:19.780]   not the general structure of the equations,
[02:16:19.780 --> 02:16:23.620]   but the relative importance of different terms,
[02:16:23.620 --> 02:16:25.260]   they seem to be every bit as important
[02:16:25.260 --> 02:16:27.780]   as the structure of the equations themselves.
[02:16:27.780 --> 02:16:29.380]   And so I forget who it was,
[02:16:29.380 --> 02:16:31.200]   somebody when they were working through this
[02:16:31.200 --> 02:16:34.020]   and trying to see, okay, if I adjust the parameter,
[02:16:34.020 --> 02:16:35.260]   this parameter over here, call it the,
[02:16:35.260 --> 02:16:36.780]   say the fine structure constant,
[02:16:36.780 --> 02:16:37.940]   which tells us the strength
[02:16:37.940 --> 02:16:40.420]   of the electromagnetic interaction.
[02:16:40.420 --> 02:16:42.300]   Oh boy, I can't change it very much,
[02:16:42.300 --> 02:16:43.740]   otherwise nothing works.
[02:16:43.740 --> 02:16:45.380]   The universe sort of doesn't,
[02:16:45.380 --> 02:16:47.220]   it just pops into existence and goes away
[02:16:47.220 --> 02:16:48.940]   in a nanosecond or something like that.
[02:16:48.940 --> 02:16:52.920]   And somebody had the phrase, this looks like a put-up job,
[02:16:52.920 --> 02:16:57.060]   meaning every one of these parameters was dialed in.
[02:16:57.060 --> 02:17:00.700]   It's arguable how precisely they have to be dialed in,
[02:17:00.700 --> 02:17:02.740]   but dialed in to some extent,
[02:17:02.740 --> 02:17:05.360]   not just in order to enable our existence,
[02:17:05.360 --> 02:17:07.120]   that's a very anthropocentric view,
[02:17:07.120 --> 02:17:10.020]   but to enable a universe like this one.
[02:17:10.020 --> 02:17:14.040]   So, okay, maybe I think the majority position
[02:17:14.040 --> 02:17:17.020]   of working physicists in the field is,
[02:17:17.020 --> 02:17:18.940]   it has to be that way in order for us to exist.
[02:17:18.940 --> 02:17:20.380]   We're here, we shouldn't be surprised
[02:17:20.380 --> 02:17:22.780]   that that's the way the universe is.
[02:17:22.780 --> 02:17:26.100]   And I don't know, for a while, that never sat well with me,
[02:17:26.100 --> 02:17:29.440]   but I just kind of moved on because there are things to do
[02:17:29.440 --> 02:17:31.140]   and a lot of exciting work.
[02:17:31.140 --> 02:17:33.780]   It doesn't depend on resolving this puzzle,
[02:17:33.780 --> 02:17:38.780]   but as I started working more with technology,
[02:17:39.340 --> 02:17:41.820]   getting into the more recent years of my career,
[02:17:41.820 --> 02:17:43.740]   particularly when I started,
[02:17:43.740 --> 02:17:46.520]   after having worked with silicon for a long time,
[02:17:46.520 --> 02:17:49.020]   which was kind of eerie on its own,
[02:17:49.020 --> 02:17:51.180]   but then when I switched over to superconductors,
[02:17:51.180 --> 02:17:53.580]   just like, this is crazy.
[02:17:53.580 --> 02:17:57.380]   It's just absolutely astonishing
[02:17:57.380 --> 02:18:00.580]   that our universe gives us superconductivity.
[02:18:00.580 --> 02:18:02.500]   It's one of the most beautiful physical phenomena,
[02:18:02.500 --> 02:18:06.580]   and it's also extraordinarily useful for technology.
[02:18:06.580 --> 02:18:07.940]   So you can argue that the universe
[02:18:07.940 --> 02:18:11.300]   has to have the parameters it does for us to exist
[02:18:11.300 --> 02:18:13.020]   because we couldn't be here otherwise.
[02:18:13.020 --> 02:18:14.800]   But why does it give us technology?
[02:18:14.800 --> 02:18:18.860]   Why does it give us silicon that has this ideal oxide
[02:18:18.860 --> 02:18:20.940]   that allows us to make a transistor
[02:18:20.940 --> 02:18:22.500]   without trying that hard?
[02:18:22.500 --> 02:18:26.760]   That can't be explained by the same anthropic reasoning.
[02:18:26.760 --> 02:18:30.380]   - Yeah, so it's asking the why question.
[02:18:30.380 --> 02:18:34.700]   I mean, a slight natural extension of that question is,
[02:18:34.700 --> 02:18:39.420]   I wonder if the parameters were different,
[02:18:39.420 --> 02:18:44.240]   if we would simply have just another set of paint brushes
[02:18:44.240 --> 02:18:46.900]   to create totally other things
[02:18:46.900 --> 02:18:49.220]   that wouldn't look like anything
[02:18:49.220 --> 02:18:50.900]   like the technology of today,
[02:18:50.900 --> 02:18:54.540]   but would nevertheless have incredible complexity,
[02:18:54.540 --> 02:18:57.180]   which is if you sort of zoom out and start defining things,
[02:18:57.180 --> 02:19:01.460]   not by how many batteries it needs
[02:19:01.460 --> 02:19:03.580]   and whether it can make toast,
[02:19:03.580 --> 02:19:06.460]   but more like how much complexity is within the system
[02:19:06.460 --> 02:19:07.300]   or something like that.
[02:19:07.300 --> 02:19:10.060]   - Well, yeah, you can start to quantify things.
[02:19:10.060 --> 02:19:10.900]   You're exactly right.
[02:19:10.900 --> 02:19:13.740]   So nowhere am I arguing that
[02:19:13.740 --> 02:19:15.860]   in all of the vast parameter space
[02:19:15.860 --> 02:19:18.060]   of everything that could conceivably exist
[02:19:18.060 --> 02:19:20.660]   in the multiverse of nature,
[02:19:20.660 --> 02:19:23.300]   there is this one point in parameter space
[02:19:23.300 --> 02:19:25.180]   where complexity arises.
[02:19:25.180 --> 02:19:26.660]   I doubt it.
[02:19:26.660 --> 02:19:31.140]   That would be a shameful waste of resources, it seems.
[02:19:31.140 --> 02:19:34.700]   But it might be that we reside at one place
[02:19:34.700 --> 02:19:38.460]   in parameter space that has been adapted
[02:19:38.460 --> 02:19:40.060]   through an evolutionary process
[02:19:40.060 --> 02:19:43.460]   to allow us to make certain technologies
[02:19:43.460 --> 02:19:47.100]   that allow our particular kind of universe to arise
[02:19:47.100 --> 02:19:49.780]   and sort of achieve the things it does.
[02:19:49.780 --> 02:19:52.740]   - See, I wonder if nature in this kind of discussion,
[02:19:52.740 --> 02:19:55.720]   if nature is a catalyst for innovation
[02:19:55.720 --> 02:19:57.700]   or if it's a ceiling for innovation.
[02:19:57.700 --> 02:20:00.780]   So like, is it going to always limit us,
[02:20:00.780 --> 02:20:03.980]   like you're talking about Silicon,
[02:20:03.980 --> 02:20:06.620]   is it just make it super easy to do awesome stuff
[02:20:06.620 --> 02:20:08.020]   in a certain dimension,
[02:20:08.020 --> 02:20:10.260]   but we could still do awesome stuff in other ways,
[02:20:10.260 --> 02:20:11.580]   it'll just be harder?
[02:20:11.580 --> 02:20:15.380]   Or does it really set the maximum we can do?
[02:20:15.380 --> 02:20:19.420]   - That's a good subject to discuss.
[02:20:19.420 --> 02:20:20.960]   I guess I feel like we need to lay
[02:20:20.960 --> 02:20:23.140]   a little bit more groundwork.
[02:20:23.140 --> 02:20:24.780]   So I want to make sure that
[02:20:24.780 --> 02:20:29.240]   I introduce this in the context
[02:20:29.240 --> 02:20:31.740]   of Lee Smolin's previous idea.
[02:20:31.740 --> 02:20:35.620]   - So who is Lee Smolin and what kind of ideas does he have?
[02:20:35.620 --> 02:20:39.020]   - Okay, Lee Smolin is a theoretical physicist
[02:20:39.020 --> 02:20:42.420]   who back in the late 1980s published a paper
[02:20:42.420 --> 02:20:45.020]   in the early 1990s introduced this idea
[02:20:45.020 --> 02:20:46.980]   of cosmological natural selection,
[02:20:46.980 --> 02:20:51.380]   which argues that the universe did evolve.
[02:20:51.380 --> 02:20:54.460]   So his paper was called "Did the Universe Evolve?"
[02:20:54.460 --> 02:20:59.460]   And I gave myself the liberty of titling my paper,
[02:20:59.460 --> 02:21:03.920]   "Does Cosmological Evolution Select for Technology?"
[02:21:03.920 --> 02:21:04.980]   in reference to that.
[02:21:04.980 --> 02:21:08.180]   So he introduced that idea decades ago,
[02:21:08.180 --> 02:21:12.160]   now he primarily works on quantum gravity,
[02:21:12.160 --> 02:21:14.620]   loop quantum gravity, other approaches to
[02:21:14.620 --> 02:21:19.280]   unifying quantum mechanics with general relativity,
[02:21:19.280 --> 02:21:22.340]   as you can read about in his most recent book, I believe,
[02:21:22.340 --> 02:21:24.280]   and he's been on your show as well.
[02:21:24.280 --> 02:21:27.780]   So, but I want to introduce this idea
[02:21:27.780 --> 02:21:29.380]   of cosmological natural selection,
[02:21:29.380 --> 02:21:32.640]   because I think that is one of the core ideas
[02:21:32.640 --> 02:21:35.300]   that could change our understanding
[02:21:35.300 --> 02:21:37.800]   of how the universe got here, our role in it,
[02:21:37.800 --> 02:21:39.840]   what technology is doing here.
[02:21:39.840 --> 02:21:41.260]   But there's a couple more pieces
[02:21:41.260 --> 02:21:42.340]   that need to be set up first.
[02:21:42.340 --> 02:21:44.240]   So the beginning of our universe
[02:21:44.240 --> 02:21:47.280]   is largely accepted to be the Big Bang.
[02:21:47.280 --> 02:21:49.840]   And what that means is if you look back in time
[02:21:49.840 --> 02:21:52.540]   by looking far away in space,
[02:21:52.540 --> 02:21:56.880]   you see that everything used to be at one point,
[02:21:56.880 --> 02:21:58.820]   and it expanded away from there.
[02:21:58.820 --> 02:22:03.820]   There was an era in the evolutionary process of our universe
[02:22:03.820 --> 02:22:05.420]   that was called inflation,
[02:22:05.420 --> 02:22:08.820]   and this idea was developed primarily by Alan Guth
[02:22:08.820 --> 02:22:13.140]   and others, Andre Linde and others in the '80s.
[02:22:13.140 --> 02:22:16.020]   And this idea of inflation is basically that
[02:22:16.020 --> 02:22:21.020]   when a singularity begins this process,
[02:22:21.020 --> 02:22:25.220]   begins this process of growth,
[02:22:25.220 --> 02:22:27.580]   there can be a temporary stage
[02:22:27.580 --> 02:22:30.860]   where it just accelerates incredibly rapidly.
[02:22:30.860 --> 02:22:33.740]   And based on quantum field theory,
[02:22:33.740 --> 02:22:35.700]   this tells us that this should produce matter
[02:22:35.700 --> 02:22:37.840]   in precisely the proportions that we find
[02:22:37.840 --> 02:22:39.980]   of hydrogen and helium in the Big Bang,
[02:22:39.980 --> 02:22:44.820]   lithium too, lithium also, and other things too.
[02:22:44.820 --> 02:22:46.540]   So the predictions that come out
[02:22:46.540 --> 02:22:48.500]   of Big Bang inflationary cosmology
[02:22:48.500 --> 02:22:52.540]   have stood up extremely well to empirical verification,
[02:22:52.540 --> 02:22:55.720]   the cosmic microwave background, things like this.
[02:22:55.720 --> 02:22:59.540]   So most scientists working in the field
[02:22:59.540 --> 02:23:03.740]   think that the origin of our universe is the Big Bang.
[02:23:03.740 --> 02:23:08.040]   And I base all my thinking on that as well.
[02:23:08.040 --> 02:23:11.420]   I'm just laying this out there so that people understand
[02:23:11.420 --> 02:23:14.180]   that where I'm coming from is an extension,
[02:23:14.180 --> 02:23:19.100]   not a replacement of existing well-founded ideas.
[02:23:19.100 --> 02:23:21.940]   In a paper, I believe it was 1986,
[02:23:21.940 --> 02:23:26.580]   with Alan Guth and another author, Farhi,
[02:23:26.580 --> 02:23:30.300]   they wrote that a Big Bang,
[02:23:30.300 --> 02:23:31.540]   I don't remember the exact quote,
[02:23:31.540 --> 02:23:35.260]   a Big Bang is inextricably linked with a black hole.
[02:23:35.260 --> 02:23:39.240]   This singularity that we call our origin
[02:23:39.240 --> 02:23:42.020]   is mathematically indistinguishable from a black hole.
[02:23:42.020 --> 02:23:44.340]   They're the same thing.
[02:23:44.340 --> 02:23:49.340]   And Lee Smolin based his thinking on that idea, I believe.
[02:23:49.340 --> 02:23:52.100]   I don't mean to speak for him, but this is my reading of it.
[02:23:52.100 --> 02:23:54.980]   So what Lee Smolin will say is that
[02:23:54.980 --> 02:23:57.780]   a black hole in one universe
[02:23:57.780 --> 02:24:00.700]   is a Big Bang in another universe.
[02:24:00.700 --> 02:24:04.660]   And this allows us to have progeny, offspring.
[02:24:04.660 --> 02:24:07.900]   So a universe can be said
[02:24:07.900 --> 02:24:10.500]   to have come before another universe.
[02:24:10.500 --> 02:24:14.180]   And very crucially, Smolin argues,
[02:24:14.180 --> 02:24:16.900]   I think this is potentially one of the great ideas
[02:24:16.900 --> 02:24:18.620]   of all time, that's my opinion,
[02:24:18.620 --> 02:24:22.380]   that when a black hole forms, it's not a classical entity,
[02:24:22.380 --> 02:24:24.500]   it's a quantum gravitational entity.
[02:24:24.500 --> 02:24:27.260]   So it is subject to the fluctuations
[02:24:27.260 --> 02:24:29.800]   that are inherent in quantum mechanics.
[02:24:29.800 --> 02:24:35.440]   The properties, what we're calling the parameters
[02:24:35.440 --> 02:24:38.620]   that describe the physics of that system
[02:24:38.620 --> 02:24:40.620]   are subject to slight mutations.
[02:24:40.620 --> 02:24:42.580]   So that the offspring universe
[02:24:42.580 --> 02:24:45.160]   does not have the exact same parameters
[02:24:45.160 --> 02:24:48.380]   defining its physics as its parent universe.
[02:24:48.380 --> 02:24:50.420]   They're close, but they're a little bit different.
[02:24:50.420 --> 02:24:55.140]   And so now you have a mechanism for evolution,
[02:24:55.140 --> 02:24:57.260]   for natural selection.
[02:24:57.260 --> 02:24:59.660]   - So there's mutations, so there's,
[02:24:59.660 --> 02:25:03.260]   and then if you think about the DNA of the universe
[02:25:03.260 --> 02:25:05.860]   are the basic parameters that govern its laws.
[02:25:05.860 --> 02:25:06.700]   - Exactly.
[02:25:06.700 --> 02:25:11.540]   So what Smolin said is our universe results
[02:25:11.540 --> 02:25:14.500]   from an evolutionary process that can be traced back
[02:25:14.500 --> 02:25:17.660]   some, he estimated, 200 million generations.
[02:25:17.660 --> 02:25:20.660]   Initially, there was something like a vacuum fluctuation
[02:25:20.660 --> 02:25:24.220]   that produced through random chance,
[02:25:24.220 --> 02:25:27.340]   a universe that was able to reproduce just once.
[02:25:27.340 --> 02:25:28.860]   So now it had one offspring.
[02:25:28.860 --> 02:25:31.020]   And then over time, it was able to make more and more
[02:25:31.020 --> 02:25:35.300]   until it evolved into a highly structured universe
[02:25:35.300 --> 02:25:40.220]   with a very long lifetime, with a great deal of complexity.
[02:25:40.220 --> 02:25:44.140]   And importantly, especially importantly for Lee Smolin,
[02:25:44.140 --> 02:25:47.220]   stars, stars make black holes.
[02:25:47.220 --> 02:25:50.940]   Therefore, we should expect our universe to be optimized,
[02:25:50.940 --> 02:25:53.220]   have its physical parameters optimized
[02:25:53.220 --> 02:25:55.660]   to make very large numbers of stars
[02:25:55.660 --> 02:25:57.980]   because that's how you make black holes
[02:25:57.980 --> 02:25:59.500]   and black holes make offspring.
[02:25:59.500 --> 02:26:03.780]   So we expect the physics of our universe to have evolved
[02:26:03.780 --> 02:26:06.900]   to maximize fecundity, the number of offspring.
[02:26:06.900 --> 02:26:09.260]   And the way Lee Smolin argues you do that
[02:26:09.260 --> 02:26:11.900]   is through stars that the biggest ones
[02:26:11.900 --> 02:26:13.460]   die in these core collapse supernova
[02:26:13.460 --> 02:26:15.740]   that make a black hole and a child.
[02:26:15.740 --> 02:26:19.820]   - Okay, first of all, I agree with you that
[02:26:19.820 --> 02:26:24.700]   this is back to our fractal view of everything
[02:26:24.700 --> 02:26:27.180]   from intelligence to our universe.
[02:26:27.180 --> 02:26:31.060]   That is very compelling and a very powerful idea
[02:26:31.060 --> 02:26:36.060]   that unites the origin of life
[02:26:36.060 --> 02:26:39.700]   and perhaps the origin of ideas and intelligence.
[02:26:39.700 --> 02:26:42.180]   So from a Dawkins perspective here on earth,
[02:26:42.180 --> 02:26:45.300]   the evolution of those and then the evolution
[02:26:45.300 --> 02:26:49.640]   of the laws of physics that led to us.
[02:26:49.640 --> 02:26:52.300]   I mean, it's beautiful.
[02:26:52.300 --> 02:26:54.860]   And then you stacking on top of that,
[02:26:54.860 --> 02:26:57.460]   that maybe we are one of the offspring.
[02:26:57.460 --> 02:27:01.060]   - Right, okay, so before getting into
[02:27:01.060 --> 02:27:03.060]   where I'd like to take that idea,
[02:27:03.060 --> 02:27:05.140]   let me just a little bit more groundwork.
[02:27:05.140 --> 02:27:07.060]   There is this concept of the multiverse
[02:27:07.060 --> 02:27:08.580]   and it can be confusing.
[02:27:08.580 --> 02:27:11.500]   Different people use the word multiverse in different ways.
[02:27:11.500 --> 02:27:16.900]   In the multiverse that I think is relevant to picture
[02:27:16.900 --> 02:27:20.820]   when trying to grasp Lee Smolin's idea,
[02:27:20.820 --> 02:27:24.260]   essentially every vacuum fluctuation
[02:27:24.260 --> 02:27:25.900]   can be referred to as a universe.
[02:27:26.460 --> 02:27:28.860]   It occurs, it borrows energy from the vacuum
[02:27:28.860 --> 02:27:30.200]   for some finite amount of time
[02:27:30.200 --> 02:27:33.980]   and it evanesces back into the quantum vacuum.
[02:27:33.980 --> 02:27:38.980]   And ideas of Guth before that and Andre Linde
[02:27:38.980 --> 02:27:42.820]   with eternal inflation aren't that different,
[02:27:42.820 --> 02:27:44.820]   that you would expect nature
[02:27:44.820 --> 02:27:47.260]   due to the quantum properties of the vacuum,
[02:27:47.260 --> 02:27:48.700]   which we know exist.
[02:27:48.700 --> 02:27:50.300]   They're measurable through things
[02:27:50.300 --> 02:27:52.540]   like the Casimir effect and others.
[02:27:52.540 --> 02:27:54.540]   You know that there are these fluctuations
[02:27:54.540 --> 02:27:55.420]   that are occurring.
[02:27:55.420 --> 02:27:57.820]   What Smolin is arguing is that
[02:27:57.820 --> 02:28:00.760]   there is this extensive multiverse that we,
[02:28:00.760 --> 02:28:04.860]   this universe, what we can measure and interact with
[02:28:04.860 --> 02:28:07.380]   is not unique in nature.
[02:28:07.380 --> 02:28:09.660]   It's just our residence.
[02:28:09.660 --> 02:28:10.780]   It's where we reside.
[02:28:10.780 --> 02:28:13.600]   And there are countless, potentially infinity,
[02:28:13.600 --> 02:28:17.260]   other universes, other entire evolutionary trajectories
[02:28:17.260 --> 02:28:19.140]   that have evolved into things
[02:28:19.140 --> 02:28:20.960]   like what you were mentioning a second ago
[02:28:20.960 --> 02:28:24.060]   with different parameters and different ways
[02:28:24.060 --> 02:28:27.000]   of achieving complexity and reproduction and all that stuff.
[02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:29.460]   So it's not that the evolutionary process
[02:28:29.460 --> 02:28:34.220]   is a funnel towards this end point, not at all.
[02:28:34.220 --> 02:28:36.980]   Just like the biological evolutionary process
[02:28:36.980 --> 02:28:39.340]   that has occurred within our universe
[02:28:39.340 --> 02:28:42.820]   is not a unique route toward achieving
[02:28:42.820 --> 02:28:44.980]   one specific chosen kind of species.
[02:28:44.980 --> 02:28:49.180]   No, we have extraordinary diversity around us.
[02:28:49.180 --> 02:28:50.500]   That's what evolution does.
[02:28:50.500 --> 02:28:52.180]   - And for any one species like us,
[02:28:52.180 --> 02:28:54.860]   it might feel like we're at the center of this process.
[02:28:54.860 --> 02:28:57.140]   We're the destination of this process,
[02:28:57.140 --> 02:28:59.460]   but we're just one of the many
[02:28:59.460 --> 02:29:02.220]   nearly infinite branches of this process.
[02:29:02.220 --> 02:29:04.220]   - And I suspect it is exactly infinite.
[02:29:04.220 --> 02:29:09.020]   I mean, I just can't understand how with this idea,
[02:29:09.020 --> 02:29:11.020]   you can ever draw a boundary around and say,
[02:29:11.020 --> 02:29:13.460]   no, the universe, I mean, the multiverse
[02:29:13.460 --> 02:29:17.680]   has 10 to the one quadrillion components,
[02:29:17.680 --> 02:29:18.860]   but not infinity.
[02:29:18.860 --> 02:29:20.140]   I don't know.
[02:29:20.140 --> 02:29:24.060]   - Well, yeah, I have cognitively incapable,
[02:29:24.060 --> 02:29:25.660]   as I think all of us are,
[02:29:25.660 --> 02:29:29.100]   in truly understanding the concept of infinity.
[02:29:29.100 --> 02:29:31.020]   - And the concept of nothing as well.
[02:29:31.020 --> 02:29:31.940]   - And nothing.
[02:29:31.940 --> 02:29:35.440]   But also the concept of a lot is pretty difficult.
[02:29:35.440 --> 02:29:39.980]   I run out of fingers at a certain point,
[02:29:39.980 --> 02:29:40.820]   and then you're screwed.
[02:29:40.820 --> 02:29:41.820]   - And when you're wearing shoes
[02:29:41.820 --> 02:29:44.460]   and you can't even get down to your toes, it's like.
[02:29:44.460 --> 02:29:47.100]   - It's like, all right, 1,000, fine, a million.
[02:29:47.100 --> 02:29:48.100]   Is that, what?
[02:29:48.100 --> 02:29:50.100]   And then it gets crazier and crazier.
[02:29:50.100 --> 02:29:51.740]   - Right, right.
[02:29:51.740 --> 02:29:54.860]   - So this particular, so when we say technology, by the way,
[02:29:54.860 --> 02:30:00.660]   I mean, there's some, not to over-romanticize the thing,
[02:30:00.660 --> 02:30:04.180]   but there is some aspect about this branch of ours
[02:30:04.180 --> 02:30:08.060]   that allows us to, for the universe to know itself.
[02:30:08.060 --> 02:30:08.980]   - Yes, yes.
[02:30:08.980 --> 02:30:13.980]   - So to have like little conscious cognitive fingers
[02:30:13.980 --> 02:30:18.340]   that are able to feel, like to scratch the head.
[02:30:18.340 --> 02:30:19.660]   - Right, right, right.
[02:30:19.660 --> 02:30:22.060]   - To be able to construct E equals MC squared
[02:30:22.060 --> 02:30:25.660]   and to introspect, to start to gain some understanding
[02:30:25.660 --> 02:30:27.460]   of the laws that govern it.
[02:30:27.460 --> 02:30:32.060]   Isn't that kind of amazing?
[02:30:32.060 --> 02:30:35.620]   Okay, I'm just human, but it feels like that,
[02:30:35.620 --> 02:30:39.260]   if I were to build a system that does this kind of thing,
[02:30:39.260 --> 02:30:42.100]   that evolves laws of physics, that evolves life,
[02:30:42.100 --> 02:30:45.500]   that evolves intelligence, that my goal would be
[02:30:45.500 --> 02:30:47.020]   to come up with things that are able
[02:30:47.020 --> 02:30:49.300]   to think about itself, right?
[02:30:49.300 --> 02:30:53.380]   Aren't we kind of close to the design specs,
[02:30:53.380 --> 02:30:54.700]   the destination?
[02:30:54.700 --> 02:30:56.060]   - We're pretty close, I don't know.
[02:30:56.060 --> 02:30:58.380]   I mean, I'm spending my career designing things
[02:30:58.380 --> 02:30:59.780]   that I hope will think about themselves,
[02:30:59.780 --> 02:31:02.700]   so that you and I aren't too far apart on that one.
[02:31:02.700 --> 02:31:05.500]   - But then maybe that problem is a lot harder
[02:31:05.500 --> 02:31:06.380]   than we imagine.
[02:31:06.380 --> 02:31:07.820]   Maybe we need to--
[02:31:07.820 --> 02:31:10.840]   - Let's not get too far, because I want to emphasize
[02:31:10.840 --> 02:31:14.620]   something that what you're saying is, isn't it fascinating
[02:31:14.620 --> 02:31:18.660]   that the universe evolved something that can be conscious,
[02:31:18.660 --> 02:31:22.420]   reflect on itself, but Lee Smolin's idea
[02:31:22.420 --> 02:31:23.780]   didn't take us there, remember?
[02:31:23.780 --> 02:31:25.740]   It took us to stars.
[02:31:25.740 --> 02:31:30.340]   Lee Smolin has argued, I think, right on almost
[02:31:30.340 --> 02:31:35.340]   every single way that cosmological natural selection
[02:31:35.340 --> 02:31:38.780]   could lead to a universe with rich structure,
[02:31:38.780 --> 02:31:41.140]   and he argued that the structure,
[02:31:41.140 --> 02:31:43.180]   the physics of our universe is designed
[02:31:43.180 --> 02:31:46.140]   to make a lot of stars so that they can make black holes.
[02:31:46.140 --> 02:31:48.380]   But that doesn't explain what we're doing here.
[02:31:48.380 --> 02:31:51.380]   In order for that to be an explanation of us,
[02:31:51.380 --> 02:31:55.380]   what you have to assume is that once you made that universe
[02:31:55.380 --> 02:31:59.220]   that was capable of producing stars, life, planets,
[02:31:59.220 --> 02:32:01.300]   all these other things, we're along for the ride.
[02:32:01.300 --> 02:32:02.180]   They got lucky.
[02:32:02.180 --> 02:32:05.600]   We're kind of arising, growing up in the cracks,
[02:32:05.600 --> 02:32:07.220]   but the universe isn't here for us.
[02:32:07.220 --> 02:32:09.540]   We're still kind of a fluke in that picture.
[02:32:09.540 --> 02:32:14.060]   And I don't necessarily have a philosophical opposition
[02:32:14.060 --> 02:32:14.900]   to that stance.
[02:32:14.900 --> 02:32:16.220]   It's just not...
[02:32:17.220 --> 02:32:20.220]   Okay, so I don't think it's complete.
[02:32:20.220 --> 02:32:22.980]   - So it seems like whatever we got going on here to you,
[02:32:22.980 --> 02:32:25.660]   it seems like whatever we have here on Earth
[02:32:25.660 --> 02:32:28.500]   seems like a thing you might want to select for
[02:32:28.500 --> 02:32:29.700]   in this whole big process.
[02:32:29.700 --> 02:32:30.540]   - Exactly.
[02:32:30.540 --> 02:32:32.100]   So if what you are truly,
[02:32:32.100 --> 02:32:34.900]   if your entire evolutionary process
[02:32:34.900 --> 02:32:36.820]   only cares about fecundity,
[02:32:36.820 --> 02:32:39.800]   it only cares about making offspring universes
[02:32:39.800 --> 02:32:41.780]   because then there's gonna be the most of them
[02:32:41.780 --> 02:32:45.160]   in that local region of hyperspace,
[02:32:45.160 --> 02:32:49.360]   which is the set of all possible universes, let's say.
[02:32:49.360 --> 02:32:52.860]   You don't care how those universes are made.
[02:32:52.860 --> 02:32:54.900]   You know they have to be made by black holes.
[02:32:54.900 --> 02:32:57.980]   This is what inflationary theory tells us.
[02:32:57.980 --> 02:33:02.120]   The Big Bang tells us that black holes make universes.
[02:33:02.120 --> 02:33:04.260]   But what if there was a technological means
[02:33:04.260 --> 02:33:06.000]   to make universes?
[02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:09.380]   Stars require a ton of matter
[02:33:09.380 --> 02:33:11.700]   because they're not thinking very carefully
[02:33:11.700 --> 02:33:12.860]   about how you make a black hole.
[02:33:12.860 --> 02:33:15.080]   They're just using gravity, you know?
[02:33:15.080 --> 02:33:19.260]   But if we devise technologies
[02:33:19.260 --> 02:33:23.380]   that can efficiently compress matter into a singularity,
[02:33:23.380 --> 02:33:26.300]   it turns out that if you can compress about 10 kilograms
[02:33:26.300 --> 02:33:28.660]   into a very small volume,
[02:33:28.660 --> 02:33:30.580]   that will make a black hole that is likely,
[02:33:30.580 --> 02:33:34.820]   highly probable to inflate into its own offspring universe.
[02:33:34.820 --> 02:33:37.180]   This is according to calculations done by other people
[02:33:37.180 --> 02:33:38.820]   who are professional quantum theorists,
[02:33:38.820 --> 02:33:40.260]   quantum field theorists,
[02:33:40.260 --> 02:33:44.580]   and I hope I am grasping what they're telling me correctly.
[02:33:44.580 --> 02:33:47.620]   I'm somewhat of a translator here.
[02:33:47.620 --> 02:33:50.460]   But so that's the position
[02:33:50.460 --> 02:33:52.700]   that is particularly intriguing to me,
[02:33:52.700 --> 02:33:56.300]   which is that what might have happened is that,
[02:33:56.300 --> 02:34:01.160]   okay, this particular branch on the vast tree of evolution,
[02:34:01.160 --> 02:34:03.240]   cosmological evolution that we're talking about,
[02:34:03.240 --> 02:34:05.740]   not biological evolution within our universe,
[02:34:05.740 --> 02:34:07.780]   but cosmological evolution,
[02:34:07.780 --> 02:34:09.600]   went through exactly the process
[02:34:09.600 --> 02:34:10.940]   that Lee Smolin described.
[02:34:10.940 --> 02:34:15.840]   Got to the stage where stars were making lots of black holes,
[02:34:15.840 --> 02:34:19.540]   but then continued to evolve and somehow bridge that gap
[02:34:19.540 --> 02:34:21.220]   and made intelligence,
[02:34:21.220 --> 02:34:24.120]   and intelligence capable of devising technologies
[02:34:24.120 --> 02:34:25.680]   because technologies,
[02:34:25.680 --> 02:34:29.660]   intelligent species working in conjunction with technologies
[02:34:29.660 --> 02:34:32.140]   could then produce even more--
[02:34:32.140 --> 02:34:35.860]   - Yeah, more efficiently, more faster and better
[02:34:35.860 --> 02:34:36.860]   and more different.
[02:34:36.860 --> 02:34:38.820]   Then you start to have different kind of mechanisms
[02:34:38.820 --> 02:34:40.820]   and mutation perhaps, all that kind of stuff.
[02:34:40.820 --> 02:34:43.100]   - And so if you do a simple calculation that says,
[02:34:43.100 --> 02:34:45.300]   all right, if I want to,
[02:34:45.300 --> 02:34:50.300]   we know roughly how many core collapse supernovae
[02:34:50.300 --> 02:34:54.460]   have resulted in black holes in our galaxy
[02:34:54.460 --> 02:34:55.980]   since the beginning of the universe,
[02:34:55.980 --> 02:34:57.780]   and it's something like a billion.
[02:34:57.780 --> 02:35:00.620]   So then you would have to estimate
[02:35:00.620 --> 02:35:04.260]   that it would be possible for a technological civilization
[02:35:04.260 --> 02:35:07.420]   to produce more than a billion black holes
[02:35:07.420 --> 02:35:09.980]   with the energy and matter at their disposal.
[02:35:09.980 --> 02:35:12.660]   And so one of the calculations in that paper,
[02:35:12.660 --> 02:35:14.060]   back of the envelope,
[02:35:14.060 --> 02:35:15.660]   but I think revealing nonetheless,
[02:35:15.660 --> 02:35:20.660]   is that if you take a relatively common asteroid,
[02:35:20.660 --> 02:35:23.660]   something that's about a kilometer in diameter,
[02:35:23.660 --> 02:35:26.700]   what I'm thinking of is just scrap material
[02:35:26.700 --> 02:35:29.020]   laying around in our solar system
[02:35:29.020 --> 02:35:31.420]   and break it up into 10 kilogram chunks
[02:35:31.420 --> 02:35:33.360]   and turn each of those into a universe,
[02:35:33.360 --> 02:35:38.140]   then you would have made at least a trillion black holes
[02:35:38.140 --> 02:35:41.540]   outpacing the star production rate
[02:35:41.540 --> 02:35:43.380]   by some three orders of magnitude.
[02:35:43.380 --> 02:35:44.820]   That's one asteroid.
[02:35:44.820 --> 02:35:46.880]   So now if you envision an intelligent species
[02:35:46.880 --> 02:35:51.620]   that would potentially have been devised initially by humans,
[02:35:51.620 --> 02:35:53.180]   but then based on superconducting
[02:35:53.180 --> 02:35:55.220]   up to electronic networks, no doubt,
[02:35:55.220 --> 02:35:57.140]   and they go out and populate,
[02:35:57.140 --> 02:35:58.980]   they don't have to fill the galaxy.
[02:35:58.980 --> 02:36:01.700]   They just have to get out to the asteroid belt.
[02:36:01.700 --> 02:36:05.280]   They could potentially dramatically outpace
[02:36:05.280 --> 02:36:07.880]   the rate at which stars are producing offspring universes.
[02:36:07.880 --> 02:36:09.800]   And then wouldn't you expect that
[02:36:09.800 --> 02:36:13.120]   that's where we came from instead of a star?
[02:36:13.120 --> 02:36:16.560]   - Yeah, so you have to somehow become masters of gravity?
[02:36:16.560 --> 02:36:17.400]   So like, or generate--
[02:36:17.400 --> 02:36:18.720]   - John, this is really gravity.
[02:36:18.720 --> 02:36:20.640]   So stars make black holes with gravity,
[02:36:20.640 --> 02:36:25.640]   but any force that can make the energy density
[02:36:25.640 --> 02:36:28.320]   can compactify matter to produce
[02:36:28.320 --> 02:36:31.140]   a great enough energy density can form a singularity.
[02:36:31.140 --> 02:36:33.520]   It doesn't, it would not likely be gravity.
[02:36:33.520 --> 02:36:34.520]   It's the weakest force.
[02:36:34.520 --> 02:36:37.540]   You're more likely to use something like
[02:36:37.540 --> 02:36:39.200]   the technologies that we're developing
[02:36:39.200 --> 02:36:40.500]   for fusion, for example.
[02:36:40.500 --> 02:36:44.240]   So I don't know, the Large Ignition Facility
[02:36:44.240 --> 02:36:49.240]   recently blasted a pellet with 100 really bright lasers
[02:36:49.240 --> 02:36:53.360]   and caused that to get dense enough
[02:36:53.360 --> 02:36:55.280]   to engage in nuclear fusion.
[02:36:55.280 --> 02:36:56.560]   So something more like that,
[02:36:56.560 --> 02:36:58.720]   or a tokamak with a really hot plasma.
[02:36:58.720 --> 02:37:00.320]   I'm not sure, something.
[02:37:00.320 --> 02:37:02.140]   I don't know exactly how it would be done.
[02:37:02.140 --> 02:37:04.540]   - I do like the idea that,
[02:37:04.540 --> 02:37:05.900]   especially just been reading a lot
[02:37:05.900 --> 02:37:09.620]   about gravitational waves and the fact that us humans
[02:37:09.620 --> 02:37:11.720]   with our technological capabilities,
[02:37:11.720 --> 02:37:15.820]   one of the most impressive technological accomplishments
[02:37:15.820 --> 02:37:17.380]   of human history is LIGO,
[02:37:17.380 --> 02:37:20.700]   being able to precisely detect gravitational waves.
[02:37:20.700 --> 02:37:25.020]   I'm particularly find appealing the idea
[02:37:25.020 --> 02:37:29.540]   that other alien civilizations from very far distances
[02:37:29.540 --> 02:37:34.340]   communicate with gravity, with gravitational waves.
[02:37:34.340 --> 02:37:37.780]   Because as you become greater and greater master of gravity,
[02:37:37.780 --> 02:37:40.580]   which seems way out of reach for us right now,
[02:37:40.580 --> 02:37:44.060]   maybe that seems like a effective way of sending signals,
[02:37:44.060 --> 02:37:48.380]   especially if your job is to manufacture black holes.
[02:37:48.380 --> 02:37:49.220]   - Right.
[02:37:49.220 --> 02:37:51.820]   - So let me ask there,
[02:37:51.820 --> 02:37:56.420]   whatever, I mean, broadly thinking,
[02:37:56.420 --> 02:37:58.900]   'cause we tend to think other alien civilizations
[02:37:58.900 --> 02:37:59.980]   would be very human-like,
[02:37:59.980 --> 02:38:04.020]   but if we think of alien civilizations out there
[02:38:04.020 --> 02:38:06.600]   as basically generators of black holes,
[02:38:06.600 --> 02:38:10.000]   however they do it, 'cause they get stars,
[02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:12.740]   do you think there's a lot of them
[02:38:12.740 --> 02:38:15.720]   in our particular universe out there?
[02:38:15.720 --> 02:38:19.160]   - In our universe?
[02:38:19.160 --> 02:38:23.340]   - Well, okay, let me ask, okay, this is great.
[02:38:23.340 --> 02:38:26.660]   Let me ask a very generic question,
[02:38:26.660 --> 02:38:29.180]   and then let's see how you answer it,
[02:38:29.180 --> 02:38:34.080]   which is how many alien civilizations are out there?
[02:38:34.080 --> 02:38:38.380]   - If the hypothesis that I just described
[02:38:38.380 --> 02:38:42.300]   is on the right track, it would mean that
[02:38:42.300 --> 02:38:45.620]   the parameters of our universe have been selected
[02:38:45.620 --> 02:38:48.440]   so that intelligent civilizations
[02:38:48.440 --> 02:38:51.100]   will occur in sufficient numbers,
[02:38:51.100 --> 02:38:54.900]   so that if they reach something like
[02:38:54.900 --> 02:38:56.460]   supreme technological maturity,
[02:38:56.460 --> 02:39:00.060]   let's define that as the ability to produce black holes,
[02:39:00.060 --> 02:39:03.440]   then that's not a highly improbable event.
[02:39:03.440 --> 02:39:05.420]   It doesn't need to happen often,
[02:39:05.420 --> 02:39:06.660]   because as I just described,
[02:39:06.660 --> 02:39:09.180]   if you get one of them in a galaxy,
[02:39:09.180 --> 02:39:10.500]   you're gonna make more black holes
[02:39:10.500 --> 02:39:12.700]   than the stars in that galaxy.
[02:39:12.700 --> 02:39:17.100]   But there's also not a super strong motivation, well,
[02:39:17.100 --> 02:39:21.560]   it's not obvious that you need them
[02:39:21.560 --> 02:39:24.060]   to be ubiquitous throughout the galaxy.
[02:39:24.060 --> 02:39:27.540]   So one of the things that I try to emphasize in that paper
[02:39:27.540 --> 02:39:32.540]   is that given this idea of how our parameters
[02:39:32.540 --> 02:39:35.100]   might have been selected,
[02:39:35.100 --> 02:39:39.260]   it's clear that it's a series of trade-offs, right?
[02:39:39.260 --> 02:39:42.020]   If you make, I mean, in order for intelligent life
[02:39:42.020 --> 02:39:45.740]   of our variety or anything resembling us to occur,
[02:39:45.740 --> 02:39:46.740]   you need a bunch of stuff.
[02:39:46.740 --> 02:39:49.420]   You need stars, so that's right back
[02:39:49.420 --> 02:39:51.060]   to Smolin's roots of this idea,
[02:39:51.060 --> 02:39:54.460]   but you also need water to have certain properties.
[02:39:54.460 --> 02:39:58.740]   You need things like the rocky planets,
[02:39:58.740 --> 02:40:00.620]   like the Earth to be within the habitable zone,
[02:40:00.620 --> 02:40:02.700]   all these things that you start talking about
[02:40:02.700 --> 02:40:06.780]   in the field of astrobiology,
[02:40:06.780 --> 02:40:08.820]   trying to understand life in the universe,
[02:40:08.820 --> 02:40:10.500]   but you can't overemphasize,
[02:40:10.500 --> 02:40:13.620]   you can't tune the parameters so precisely
[02:40:13.620 --> 02:40:15.180]   to maximize the number of stars
[02:40:15.180 --> 02:40:18.980]   or to give water exactly the properties
[02:40:18.980 --> 02:40:22.260]   or to make rocky planets like Earth the most numerous.
[02:40:22.260 --> 02:40:24.500]   You have to compromise on all these things.
[02:40:24.500 --> 02:40:27.380]   And so I think the way to test this idea
[02:40:27.380 --> 02:40:30.260]   is to look at what parameters are necessary
[02:40:30.260 --> 02:40:32.780]   for each of these different subsystems,
[02:40:32.780 --> 02:40:34.860]   and I've laid out a few that I think are promising,
[02:40:34.860 --> 02:40:36.660]   there could be countless others,
[02:40:36.660 --> 02:40:40.860]   and see how changing the parameters
[02:40:40.860 --> 02:40:43.580]   makes it more or less likely that stars would form
[02:40:43.580 --> 02:40:44.620]   and have long lifetimes,
[02:40:44.620 --> 02:40:47.300]   or that rocky planets in the habitable zone
[02:40:47.300 --> 02:40:49.380]   are likely to form, all these different things.
[02:40:49.380 --> 02:40:52.180]   So we can test how much these things
[02:40:52.180 --> 02:40:54.580]   are in a tug of war with each other.
[02:40:54.580 --> 02:40:57.140]   And the prediction would be that we kind of sit
[02:40:57.140 --> 02:41:00.580]   at this central point where if you move the parameters
[02:41:00.580 --> 02:41:03.140]   too much, stars aren't stable,
[02:41:03.140 --> 02:41:07.740]   or life doesn't form, or technology's infeasible,
[02:41:07.740 --> 02:41:10.780]   'cause life alone, at least the kind of life
[02:41:10.780 --> 02:41:14.140]   that we know of, cannot make black holes.
[02:41:14.140 --> 02:41:17.020]   We don't have the, well, I'm speaking for myself,
[02:41:17.020 --> 02:41:18.540]   you're a very fit, strong person,
[02:41:18.540 --> 02:41:20.600]   but it might be possible for you,
[02:41:20.600 --> 02:41:22.380]   but not for me to compress matter.
[02:41:22.380 --> 02:41:23.820]   So we need these technologies,
[02:41:23.820 --> 02:41:28.820]   but we don't know, we have not been able to quantify yet
[02:41:28.820 --> 02:41:33.820]   how finely adjusted the parameters would need to be
[02:41:33.820 --> 02:41:35.580]   in order for silicon to have the properties it does.
[02:41:35.580 --> 02:41:37.820]   Okay, this is not directly speaking to what you're saying,
[02:41:37.820 --> 02:41:39.500]   you're getting to the Fermi paradox,
[02:41:39.500 --> 02:41:42.840]   which is where are they, where are the life forms out there,
[02:41:42.840 --> 02:41:44.580]   how numerous are they, that sort of thing.
[02:41:44.580 --> 02:41:49.100]   What I'm trying to argue is that if this framework
[02:41:49.100 --> 02:41:52.480]   is on the right track, a potentially correct explanation
[02:41:52.480 --> 02:41:56.340]   for our existence, it doesn't necessarily predict
[02:41:56.340 --> 02:41:59.300]   that intelligent civilizations are just everywhere,
[02:41:59.300 --> 02:42:02.540]   because even if you just get one of them in a galaxy,
[02:42:02.540 --> 02:42:05.760]   which is quite rare, it could be enough
[02:42:05.760 --> 02:42:08.940]   to dramatically increase the fecundity
[02:42:08.940 --> 02:42:10.140]   of the universe as a whole.
[02:42:10.140 --> 02:42:12.460]   - Yeah, and I wonder, once you start generating
[02:42:12.460 --> 02:42:15.420]   the offspring for universes, black holes,
[02:42:15.420 --> 02:42:19.940]   how that has effect on the, what kind of effect does it have
[02:42:19.940 --> 02:42:24.940]   on the other candidates, civilizations within that universe?
[02:42:24.940 --> 02:42:28.420]   Maybe as a destructive aspect,
[02:42:28.420 --> 02:42:30.140]   or there could be some arguments about
[02:42:30.140 --> 02:42:32.060]   once you have a lot of offspring,
[02:42:32.060 --> 02:42:34.060]   that that just quickly accelerates
[02:42:34.060 --> 02:42:35.800]   to where the other ones can't even catch up.
[02:42:35.800 --> 02:42:40.800]   - It could, but I guess if you want me to put my chips
[02:42:41.300 --> 02:42:44.380]   on the table or whatever, I think I come down more
[02:42:44.380 --> 02:42:49.380]   on the side that intelligent life civilizations are rare.
[02:42:49.380 --> 02:42:57.140]   And I guess I follow Max Tegmark here.
[02:42:57.140 --> 02:43:00.980]   And also, there's a lot of papers coming out recently
[02:43:00.980 --> 02:43:04.340]   in the field of astrobiology that are seeming to say,
[02:43:04.340 --> 02:43:05.980]   all right, you just work through the numbers
[02:43:05.980 --> 02:43:09.660]   on some modified Drake equation or something like that.
[02:43:09.660 --> 02:43:12.940]   And it looks like it's not improbable.
[02:43:12.940 --> 02:43:16.180]   You shouldn't be surprised that an intelligent species
[02:43:16.180 --> 02:43:17.940]   has arisen in our galaxy.
[02:43:17.940 --> 02:43:20.260]   But if you think there's one the next solar system over,
[02:43:20.260 --> 02:43:21.500]   it's highly improbable.
[02:43:21.500 --> 02:43:23.860]   So I can see that the number,
[02:43:23.860 --> 02:43:28.180]   the probability of finding a civilization in a galaxy,
[02:43:28.180 --> 02:43:30.980]   maybe it's most likely that you're gonna find
[02:43:30.980 --> 02:43:32.780]   one to 100 or something.
[02:43:32.780 --> 02:43:34.860]   But okay, now it's really important
[02:43:34.860 --> 02:43:36.600]   to put a time window on that, I think.
[02:43:36.600 --> 02:43:40.700]   Because does that mean in the entire lifetime of the galaxy
[02:43:40.700 --> 02:43:45.700]   before it, so for in our case, before we run into Andromeda,
[02:43:45.700 --> 02:43:52.940]   I think it's highly probable, I shouldn't say I think,
[02:43:52.940 --> 02:43:56.740]   it's tempting to believe that it's highly probable
[02:43:56.740 --> 02:43:59.980]   that in that entire lifetime of your galaxy,
[02:43:59.980 --> 02:44:02.540]   you're gonna get at least one intelligent species,
[02:44:02.540 --> 02:44:05.140]   maybe thousands or something like that.
[02:44:05.140 --> 02:44:09.980]   But it's also, I think, a little bit naive
[02:44:09.980 --> 02:44:13.220]   to think that they're going to coincide in time
[02:44:13.220 --> 02:44:14.980]   and we'll be able to observe them.
[02:44:14.980 --> 02:44:19.980]   - And also, if you look at the span of life on Earth,
[02:44:19.980 --> 02:44:24.460]   the Earth history, it was surprising to me
[02:44:24.460 --> 02:44:27.860]   to kind of look at the amount of time,
[02:44:27.860 --> 02:44:29.700]   first of all, the short amount of time
[02:44:29.700 --> 02:44:31.520]   there's no life is surprising.
[02:44:31.520 --> 02:44:33.460]   Life spring up pretty quickly.
[02:44:33.460 --> 02:44:34.980]   - Cellular, single cell.
[02:44:34.980 --> 02:44:36.980]   - But that's the point I'm trying to make
[02:44:36.980 --> 02:44:41.980]   is so much of life on Earth
[02:44:41.980 --> 02:44:44.780]   was just single cell organisms.
[02:44:44.780 --> 02:44:48.660]   Most of it, most of it was boring bacteria type of stuff.
[02:44:48.660 --> 02:44:50.660]   - Well, bacteria are fascinating, but I take your point.
[02:44:50.660 --> 02:44:51.500]   - No, I get it.
[02:44:51.500 --> 02:44:52.900]   I mean, no offense to them.
[02:44:52.900 --> 02:44:54.420]   (laughing)
[02:44:54.420 --> 02:44:57.660]   This kind of speaking from the perspective of your paper
[02:44:57.660 --> 02:44:59.940]   of something that's able to generate technology
[02:44:59.940 --> 02:45:01.440]   as we kind of understand it,
[02:45:01.440 --> 02:45:03.400]   that's a very short moment in time
[02:45:03.400 --> 02:45:08.400]   relative to that full history of life on Earth.
[02:45:08.400 --> 02:45:12.220]   And maybe our universe is just saturated
[02:45:12.220 --> 02:45:15.920]   with bacteria like humans,
[02:45:15.920 --> 02:45:22.500]   but not the special extra AGI superhumans,
[02:45:22.500 --> 02:45:25.560]   that those are very rare.
[02:45:25.560 --> 02:45:28.420]   And once those spring up,
[02:45:28.420 --> 02:45:33.360]   everything just goes to like, it accelerates very quickly.
[02:45:33.360 --> 02:45:36.520]   - Yeah, we just don't have enough data to really say,
[02:45:36.520 --> 02:45:40.000]   but I find this whole subject extremely engaging.
[02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:41.680]   I mean, there's this concept,
[02:45:41.680 --> 02:45:43.880]   I think it's called the rare Earth hypothesis,
[02:45:43.880 --> 02:45:46.920]   which is that basically stating that,
[02:45:46.920 --> 02:45:49.040]   okay, microbes were here right away
[02:45:49.040 --> 02:45:52.140]   after the Hadean era where we were being bombarded.
[02:45:52.140 --> 02:45:54.920]   Well, after, yeah, bombarded by comets, asteroids,
[02:45:54.920 --> 02:45:57.100]   things like that, and also after the moon formed.
[02:45:57.100 --> 02:45:59.560]   So once things settled down a little bit,
[02:45:59.560 --> 02:46:02.260]   in a few hundred million years,
[02:46:02.260 --> 02:46:03.660]   you have microbes everywhere.
[02:46:03.660 --> 02:46:05.320]   And it could have been, we don't know exactly when,
[02:46:05.320 --> 02:46:08.040]   it could have been remarkably brief that that took.
[02:46:08.040 --> 02:46:09.880]   So it does indicate that,
[02:46:09.880 --> 02:46:12.120]   okay, life forms relatively easily.
[02:46:12.120 --> 02:46:15.880]   I think that alone is sort of a checker on the scale
[02:46:15.880 --> 02:46:20.480]   for the argument that the parameters
[02:46:20.480 --> 02:46:22.880]   that allow even microbial life to form
[02:46:22.880 --> 02:46:24.320]   are not just a fluke.
[02:46:24.320 --> 02:46:27.500]   But anyway, that aside, yes,
[02:46:27.500 --> 02:46:29.860]   then there was this long dormant period,
[02:46:29.860 --> 02:46:31.560]   not dormant, things were happening,
[02:46:31.560 --> 02:46:34.060]   but important things were happening
[02:46:34.060 --> 02:46:37.260]   for some two and a half billion years or something
[02:46:37.260 --> 02:46:41.620]   after the metabolic process that releases oxygen
[02:46:41.620 --> 02:46:42.780]   was developed.
[02:46:42.780 --> 02:46:46.060]   Then basically the planet's just sitting there
[02:46:46.060 --> 02:46:47.500]   getting more and more oxygenated,
[02:46:47.500 --> 02:46:50.140]   more and more oxygenated until it's enough
[02:46:50.140 --> 02:46:54.140]   that you can build these large, complex organisms.
[02:46:54.140 --> 02:46:56.440]   And so the rare earth hypothesis would argue
[02:46:56.440 --> 02:47:00.960]   that the microbes are common in everywhere,
[02:47:00.960 --> 02:47:04.120]   in any planet that's roughly in the habitable zone
[02:47:04.120 --> 02:47:06.620]   and has some water on it's probably gonna have those.
[02:47:06.620 --> 02:47:09.280]   But then getting to this Cambrian explosion
[02:47:09.280 --> 02:47:13.720]   that happened some between five and 600 million years ago,
[02:47:13.720 --> 02:47:15.420]   that's rare.
[02:47:15.420 --> 02:47:19.040]   And I buy that, I think that is rare.
[02:47:19.040 --> 02:47:21.840]   So if you say how much life is in our galaxy,
[02:47:21.840 --> 02:47:24.080]   I think that's probably the right answer
[02:47:24.080 --> 02:47:26.380]   is that microbes are everywhere.
[02:47:26.380 --> 02:47:29.280]   Cambrian explosion is extremely rare.
[02:47:29.280 --> 02:47:32.700]   And then, but the Cambrian explosion kind of went like that
[02:47:32.700 --> 02:47:37.700]   where within a couple tens or a hundred million years,
[02:47:37.700 --> 02:47:40.920]   all of these body plans came into existence.
[02:47:40.920 --> 02:47:43.040]   And basically all of the body plans
[02:47:43.040 --> 02:47:46.040]   that are now in existence on the planet
[02:47:46.040 --> 02:47:48.680]   were formed in that brief window.
[02:47:48.680 --> 02:47:51.600]   And we've just been shuffling around since then.
[02:47:51.600 --> 02:47:54.800]   So then what caused humans to pop out of that?
[02:47:54.800 --> 02:47:59.800]   I mean, that could be another extremely rare threshold
[02:47:59.800 --> 02:48:06.160]   that a planet roughly in the habitable zone with water
[02:48:06.160 --> 02:48:08.360]   is not guaranteed to cross.
[02:48:08.360 --> 02:48:10.200]   - To me, it's fascinating for being humble,
[02:48:10.200 --> 02:48:13.040]   like the humans cannot possibly be the most amazing thing
[02:48:13.040 --> 02:48:15.840]   that such, if you look at the entirety of the system,
[02:48:15.840 --> 02:48:17.780]   that at least small and you paint,
[02:48:17.780 --> 02:48:20.040]   that cannot possibly be the most amazing thing
[02:48:20.040 --> 02:48:21.440]   that process generates.
[02:48:21.440 --> 02:48:23.680]   So like, if you look at the evolution,
[02:48:23.680 --> 02:48:27.020]   what's the equivalent in the cosmological evolution
[02:48:27.020 --> 02:48:28.960]   and its selection for technology,
[02:48:28.960 --> 02:48:32.440]   the equivalent of the human eye or the human brain.
[02:48:32.440 --> 02:48:35.580]   Universes that are able to do some like,
[02:48:35.580 --> 02:48:37.760]   they don't need the damn stars.
[02:48:37.760 --> 02:48:42.080]   They're able to just do some incredible generation
[02:48:42.080 --> 02:48:46.640]   of complexity fast on scale, like much more than,
[02:48:46.640 --> 02:48:47.480]   if you think about it,
[02:48:47.480 --> 02:48:50.880]   it's like most of our universe is pretty freaking boring.
[02:48:50.880 --> 02:48:51.920]   There's not much going on.
[02:48:51.920 --> 02:48:53.360]   There's a few rocks flying around
[02:48:53.360 --> 02:48:58.360]   and there's some like apes that are just like doing podcasts
[02:48:58.360 --> 02:49:00.480]   on some weird planet.
[02:49:00.480 --> 02:49:02.840]   It just seems very inefficient.
[02:49:02.840 --> 02:49:05.960]   If you think about like the amazing thing in the human eye,
[02:49:05.960 --> 02:49:09.440]   the visual cortex can do, the brain, the nervous,
[02:49:09.440 --> 02:49:12.840]   everything that makes us more powerful
[02:49:12.840 --> 02:49:15.480]   than single cell organisms.
[02:49:15.480 --> 02:49:18.960]   Like if there's an equivalent of that for universes,
[02:49:19.320 --> 02:49:24.320]   like the richness of physics that could be expressed
[02:49:24.320 --> 02:49:26.840]   through a particular set of parameters.
[02:49:26.840 --> 02:49:31.040]   Like, I mean, like for me,
[02:49:31.040 --> 02:49:33.760]   I'm a, so from a computer science perspective,
[02:49:33.760 --> 02:49:35.600]   huge fan of cellular automata,
[02:49:35.600 --> 02:49:40.400]   which is a nice sort of pretty visual way to illustrate
[02:49:40.400 --> 02:49:42.780]   how different laws can result
[02:49:42.780 --> 02:49:46.400]   in drastically different levels of complexity.
[02:49:46.400 --> 02:49:48.960]   So like, it's like, yeah, okay.
[02:49:48.960 --> 02:49:50.280]   So we're all like celebrating,
[02:49:50.280 --> 02:49:52.080]   look, our little cellular automata
[02:49:52.080 --> 02:49:54.560]   is able to generate pretty triangles and squares
[02:49:54.560 --> 02:49:57.640]   and therefore we achieve general intelligence.
[02:49:57.640 --> 02:50:01.820]   And then there'll be like some bad-ass Chuck Norris type,
[02:50:01.820 --> 02:50:06.520]   like universal Turing machine type of cellular automata.
[02:50:06.520 --> 02:50:08.920]   They're able to generate other cellular automata
[02:50:08.920 --> 02:50:13.080]   and that does any arbitrary level of computation off the bat.
[02:50:14.120 --> 02:50:16.440]   Like those have to then exist.
[02:50:16.440 --> 02:50:20.840]   And then we're just like, we'll be forgotten is the story.
[02:50:20.840 --> 02:50:24.880]   This podcast just entertains a few other apes
[02:50:24.880 --> 02:50:26.880]   for a few months.
[02:50:26.880 --> 02:50:30.240]   - Well, I'm kind of surprised to hear your cynicism.
[02:50:30.240 --> 02:50:32.080]   - No, I'm very, I--
[02:50:32.080 --> 02:50:36.120]   - I usually think of you as like one who celebrates humanity
[02:50:36.120 --> 02:50:37.600]   in all its forms and things like that.
[02:50:37.600 --> 02:50:39.240]   And I guess I just, I don't,
[02:50:39.240 --> 02:50:41.000]   I see it the way you just described.
[02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:44.520]   I mean, okay, we've been here for 13.7 billion years
[02:50:44.520 --> 02:50:47.240]   and you're saying, gosh, that's a long time.
[02:50:47.240 --> 02:50:48.480]   Let's get on with the show already.
[02:50:48.480 --> 02:50:51.500]   Some other universe could have kicked our butt by now,
[02:50:51.500 --> 02:50:55.320]   but that's putting a characteristic time.
[02:50:55.320 --> 02:50:58.360]   I mean, why is 13.7 billion a long time?
[02:50:58.360 --> 02:51:00.400]   I mean, compared to what?
[02:51:00.400 --> 02:51:02.280]   I guess, so when I look at our universe,
[02:51:02.280 --> 02:51:05.380]   I see this extraordinary hierarchy
[02:51:05.380 --> 02:51:08.040]   that has developed over that time.
[02:51:08.040 --> 02:51:10.520]   So at the beginning, it was a chaotic mess
[02:51:10.520 --> 02:51:15.520]   of some plasma and nothing interesting going on there.
[02:51:15.520 --> 02:51:18.880]   And even for the first stars to form,
[02:51:18.880 --> 02:51:23.880]   that a lot of really interesting evolutionary processes
[02:51:23.880 --> 02:51:26.240]   had to occur by evolutionary in that sense,
[02:51:26.240 --> 02:51:30.520]   I just mean taking place over extended periods of time
[02:51:30.520 --> 02:51:32.020]   and structures are forming then.
[02:51:32.020 --> 02:51:34.640]   And then it took that first generation of stars
[02:51:34.640 --> 02:51:37.480]   in order to produce the metals
[02:51:38.760 --> 02:51:41.280]   that then can more efficiently produce
[02:51:41.280 --> 02:51:42.440]   another generation of stars.
[02:51:42.440 --> 02:51:44.720]   We're only the third generation of stars.
[02:51:44.720 --> 02:51:48.040]   So we might still be pretty quick to the game here.
[02:51:48.040 --> 02:51:50.960]   But I don't think, I don't, okay,
[02:51:50.960 --> 02:51:52.400]   so then you have these stars,
[02:51:52.400 --> 02:51:53.520]   now you have solar systems.
[02:51:53.520 --> 02:51:57.760]   On those solar systems, you have rocky worlds,
[02:51:57.760 --> 02:51:59.760]   you have gas giants, like all this complexity.
[02:51:59.760 --> 02:52:01.080]   And then you start getting life
[02:52:01.080 --> 02:52:03.760]   and the complexity that's evolved
[02:52:03.760 --> 02:52:06.400]   through the evolutionary process in life forms
[02:52:06.400 --> 02:52:09.840]   is just, it's not a letdown to me.
[02:52:09.840 --> 02:52:10.680]   Just some of it. - No, no, no.
[02:52:10.680 --> 02:52:11.600]   And there's some of it is like,
[02:52:11.600 --> 02:52:14.600]   some of the planets is like icy.
[02:52:14.600 --> 02:52:16.080]   It's like different flavors of ice cream.
[02:52:16.080 --> 02:52:18.560]   They're icy, but there might be water underneath.
[02:52:18.560 --> 02:52:21.120]   All kinds of life forms, some volcanoes.
[02:52:21.120 --> 02:52:22.320]   All kinds of weird stuff.
[02:52:22.320 --> 02:52:24.600]   No, no, no, I don't, I think it's beautiful.
[02:52:24.600 --> 02:52:25.960]   I think our life is beautiful.
[02:52:25.960 --> 02:52:28.280]   And I think it was designed that,
[02:52:28.280 --> 02:52:31.220]   by design, the scarcity of the whole thing.
[02:52:31.220 --> 02:52:33.880]   I think mortality, as terrifying as it is,
[02:52:33.880 --> 02:52:37.280]   is fundamental to the whole reason we enjoy everything.
[02:52:37.280 --> 02:52:38.200]   No, I think it's beautiful.
[02:52:38.200 --> 02:52:42.400]   I just think that all of us conscious beings,
[02:52:42.400 --> 02:52:44.560]   in the grand scheme of basically,
[02:52:44.560 --> 02:52:46.960]   at every scale, will be completely forgotten.
[02:52:46.960 --> 02:52:47.800]   - Well, that's true.
[02:52:47.800 --> 02:52:49.320]   I think everything is transient.
[02:52:49.320 --> 02:52:52.520]   And that would go back to maybe something more like Lao Tzu,
[02:52:52.520 --> 02:52:53.880]   the Tao Te Ching or something,
[02:52:53.880 --> 02:52:57.740]   where it's like, yes, there is nothing but change.
[02:52:57.740 --> 02:52:59.680]   There is nothing but emergence and dissolve,
[02:52:59.680 --> 02:53:00.720]   and that's it.
[02:53:00.720 --> 02:53:03.760]   But I just, in this picture of this hierarchy
[02:53:03.760 --> 02:53:05.520]   that's developed, I don't mean to say
[02:53:05.520 --> 02:53:07.440]   that now it gets to us and that's the pinnacle.
[02:53:07.440 --> 02:53:10.560]   In fact, I think, at a high level,
[02:53:10.560 --> 02:53:13.780]   the story I'm trying to tease out in my research
[02:53:13.780 --> 02:53:16.280]   is about, okay, well, so then what's the next level
[02:53:16.280 --> 02:53:17.120]   of hierarchy?
[02:53:17.120 --> 02:53:21.560]   And if it's, okay, we're kind of pretty smart.
[02:53:21.560 --> 02:53:23.880]   I mean, talking about people like Lee Small
[02:53:23.880 --> 02:53:26.280]   and Alan Guth, Max Tegmark, okay, we're really smart.
[02:53:26.280 --> 02:53:28.520]   Talking about me, okay, we're kind of,
[02:53:28.520 --> 02:53:30.760]   we can find our way to the grocery store or whatever.
[02:53:30.760 --> 02:53:31.960]   But-- - Sometimes.
[02:53:31.960 --> 02:53:32.800]   - But what's next?
[02:53:32.800 --> 02:53:35.440]   You know, I mean, what if there's another level
[02:53:35.440 --> 02:53:37.780]   of hierarchy that grows on top of us
[02:53:37.780 --> 02:53:40.280]   that is even more profoundly capable?
[02:53:40.280 --> 02:53:42.080]   And I mean, we've talked a lot
[02:53:42.080 --> 02:53:43.560]   about superconducting sensors.
[02:53:43.560 --> 02:53:48.560]   Imagine these cognitive systems far more capable than us
[02:53:48.560 --> 02:53:52.320]   residing somewhere else in the solar system
[02:53:52.320 --> 02:53:53.640]   off of the surface of the Earth,
[02:53:53.640 --> 02:53:55.400]   where it's much darker, much colder,
[02:53:55.400 --> 02:53:57.080]   much more naturally suited to them.
[02:53:57.080 --> 02:53:59.360]   And they have these sensors that can detect
[02:53:59.360 --> 02:54:02.640]   single photons of light from radio waves
[02:54:02.640 --> 02:54:05.200]   out to all across the spectrum to gamma rays
[02:54:05.200 --> 02:54:07.380]   and just see the whole universe.
[02:54:07.380 --> 02:54:09.960]   And they just live in space with these massive
[02:54:09.960 --> 02:54:13.660]   collection optics so that they, what do they do?
[02:54:13.660 --> 02:54:18.660]   They just look out and experience that vast array
[02:54:18.660 --> 02:54:22.520]   of what's being developed.
[02:54:22.520 --> 02:54:24.240]   - And if you're such a system,
[02:54:24.240 --> 02:54:28.920]   presumably you would do some things for fun.
[02:54:28.920 --> 02:54:31.720]   And the kind of fun thing I would do,
[02:54:31.720 --> 02:54:33.840]   as somebody who likes video games,
[02:54:33.840 --> 02:54:37.040]   is I would create and maintain
[02:54:37.040 --> 02:54:39.320]   and observe something like Earth.
[02:54:39.320 --> 02:54:40.160]   - Mm-hmm.
[02:54:40.160 --> 02:54:47.320]   - So in some sense, we're like all what players on a stage
[02:54:47.320 --> 02:54:52.320]   for this superconducting cold computing system out there.
[02:54:52.320 --> 02:54:56.680]   I mean, all of this is fascinating to think.
[02:54:56.680 --> 02:54:59.320]   The fact that you're actually designing systems
[02:54:59.320 --> 02:55:01.560]   here on Earth that are trying to push this technological,
[02:55:01.560 --> 02:55:04.800]   at the very cutting edge, and also thinking about
[02:55:04.800 --> 02:55:09.760]   how does the evolution of physical laws
[02:55:09.760 --> 02:55:14.200]   lead us to the way we are, is fascinating.
[02:55:14.200 --> 02:55:15.920]   That coupling is fascinating.
[02:55:15.920 --> 02:55:20.780]   It's like the ultimate rigorous application of philosophy
[02:55:20.780 --> 02:55:23.680]   to the rigorous application of engineering.
[02:55:23.680 --> 02:55:26.360]   So Jeff, you're one of the most fascinating,
[02:55:26.360 --> 02:55:29.000]   I'm so glad, I did not know much about you
[02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:31.480]   except through your work, and I'm so glad
[02:55:31.480 --> 02:55:35.000]   we got this chance to talk here.
[02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:37.760]   You're one of the best explainers
[02:55:37.760 --> 02:55:39.800]   of exceptionally difficult concepts,
[02:55:39.800 --> 02:55:44.560]   and you're also, speaking of like fractal,
[02:55:44.560 --> 02:55:46.640]   you're able to function intellectually
[02:55:46.640 --> 02:55:50.200]   at all levels of the stack, which I deeply appreciate.
[02:55:50.200 --> 02:55:51.600]   This was really fun.
[02:55:51.600 --> 02:55:53.560]   You're a great educator, a great scientist.
[02:55:53.560 --> 02:55:57.240]   It's an honor that you spend your valuable time with me.
[02:55:57.240 --> 02:56:00.120]   - It's an honor that you would spend your time with me.
[02:56:00.120 --> 02:56:01.760]   - Thanks, Jeff.
[02:56:01.760 --> 02:56:03.560]   Thanks for listening to this conversation
[02:56:03.560 --> 02:56:05.240]   with Jeff Shainlein.
[02:56:05.240 --> 02:56:08.040]   To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors
[02:56:08.040 --> 02:56:09.600]   in the description.
[02:56:09.600 --> 02:56:12.060]   And now, let me leave you with some words
[02:56:12.060 --> 02:56:15.960]   from the great John Carmack, who surely will be a guest
[02:56:15.960 --> 02:56:17.300]   on this podcast soon.
[02:56:17.300 --> 02:56:20.100]   Because of the nature of Moore's law,
[02:56:20.100 --> 02:56:22.800]   anything that an extremely clever graphics programmer
[02:56:22.800 --> 02:56:26.040]   can do at one point can be replicated
[02:56:26.040 --> 02:56:29.380]   by a merely competent programmer some number of years later.
[02:56:29.380 --> 02:56:33.360]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
[02:56:33.360 --> 02:56:35.940]   (upbeat music)
[02:56:35.940 --> 02:56:38.520]   (upbeat music)
