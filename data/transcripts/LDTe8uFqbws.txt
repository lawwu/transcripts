[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800]   The following is a conversation with Frank Wolchek,
[00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.920]   a theoretical physicist at MIT,
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.100]   who won the Nobel Prize for the co-discovery
[00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.160]   of asymptotic freedom in the theory of strong interaction.
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.040]   Quick mention of our sponsors,
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.720]   the Information, NetSuite, ExpressVPN, Blinkist,
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.440]   and A.S.L.E.E.P.
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.600]   Check them out in the description to support this podcast.
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.920]   As a side note, let me say a word about asymptotic freedom.
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.020]   Protons and neutrons make up the nucleus of an atom.
[00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.840]   Strong interaction is responsible
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.200]   for the strong nuclear force that binds them.
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.720]   But strong interaction also holds together the quarks
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.060]   that make up the protons and neutrons.
[00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.280]   Frank Wolchek, David Gross, and David Pulitzer
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.320]   came up with a theory postulating
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.080]   that when quarks come really close to one another,
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.480]   the attraction abates and they behave like free particles.
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.460]   This is called asymptotic freedom.
[00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.900]   This happens at very, very high energies,
[00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.680]   which is also where all the fun is.
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.920]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast,
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.580]   and here is my conversation with Frank Wolchek.
[00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.000]   What is the most beautiful idea in physics?
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.560]   - The most beautiful idea in physics
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.560]   is that we can get a compact description of the world
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.800]   that's very precise and very full
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.880]   at the level of the operating system of the world.
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.120]   That's an extraordinary gift,
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.120]   and we get worried when we find discrepancies
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.080]   between our description of the world
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.800]   and what's actually observed
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.800]   at the level even of a part in a billion.
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.440]   - You actually have this quote from Einstein
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.880]   that the most incomprehensible thing
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.920]   about the universe is that it is comprehensible,
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:55.760]   something like that.
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.320]   - Yes, so that's the most beautiful surprise
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.200]   that I think that really was, to me,
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.560]   the most profound result of the scientific revolution
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.560]   of the 17th century with the shining example
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.800]   of Newtonian physics that you could aspire
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.480]   to completeness, precision, and a concise description
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.400]   of the world, of the operating system.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.280]   And it's gotten better and better over the years,
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.940]   and that's the continuing miracle.
[00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.880]   Now, there are a lot of beautiful sub-miracles, too.
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.600]   The form of the equations is governed
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.760]   by high degrees of symmetry,
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.000]   and they have a very surprising kind
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.800]   of mind-expanding structure,
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.920]   especially in quantum mechanics.
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.920]   But if I had to say the single most beautiful revelation
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.360]   is that, in fact, the world is comprehensible.
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.440]   - Would you say that's a fact or a hope?
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.120]   - It's a fact. (laughs)
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.120]   We can do, you can point to things like the rise
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:09.360]   of gross national products per capita around the world
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.180]   as a result of the scientific revolution.
[00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.680]   You can see it all around you.
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.400]   In recent developments with exponential production
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.400]   of wealth, control of nature at a very profound level
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.440]   where we do things like sense tiny, tiny, tiny,
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.540]   tiny vibrations to tell that there are black holes
[00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.540]   colliding far away, or we test laws, as I alluded to,
[00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.400]   as a part in a billion, and do things
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.640]   in what appear on the surface
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.800]   to be entirely different conceptual universes.
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.040]   I mean, on the one hand, pencil and paper
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.520]   are nowadays computers that calculate abstractions,
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.640]   and on the other hand, magnets and accelerators
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.840]   and detectors that look at the behavior
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.000]   of fundamental particles,
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.640]   and these different universes have to agree,
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.200]   or else we get very upset.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.200]   And that's an amazing thing if you think about it.
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.200]   And it's telling us that we do understand a lot
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.580]   about nature at a very profound level.
[00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:25.520]   And there are still things we don't understand, of course,
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.960]   but as we get better and better answers
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.680]   and better and better ability to address
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.960]   difficult questions, we can ask more
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.560]   and more ambitious questions.
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.760]   - Well, I guess the hope part of that
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.280]   is because we are surrounded by mystery.
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.480]   So we've, one way to say it,
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.040]   if you look at the growth, the GDP,
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.200]   over time that we figured out quite a lot,
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.320]   and we're able to improve the quality of life
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.200]   because of that, and we've figured out
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.360]   some fundamental things about this universe,
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.400]   but we still don't know how much mystery there is.
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.520]   And it's also possible that there's some things
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.360]   that are, in fact, incomprehensible
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.400]   to both our minds and the tools of science.
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.600]   Like we, the sad thing is we may not know it
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.320]   because, in fact, they are incomprehensible.
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.000]   And that's the open question is
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.200]   how much of the universe is comprehensible?
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.880]   If we figured out the everything,
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.480]   what's inside the black hole,
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.760]   and everything that happened at the moment of the Big Bang,
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.880]   does that still give us the key
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.760]   to understanding the human mind
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.880]   and the emergence of all the beautiful complexity
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.020]   we see around us?
[00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.120]   That's not, like when I see these objects,
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.560]   like I don't know if you've seen them,
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.320]   like cellular automata, all these kinds of objects
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.940]   where from simple rules emerges complexity,
[00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.080]   it makes you wonder maybe it's not reducible
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.280]   to simple, beautiful equations, the whole thing,
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.900]   only parts of it.
[00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.680]   That's the tension I was getting at with the hope.
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.240]   - Well, when we say the universe is comprehensible,
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.940]   we have to kind of draw careful distinctions
[00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:09.940]   about, or definitions about what we mean by that.
[00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:15.240]   - Both the universe and the comprehensibility.
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.400]   - Exactly, right.
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.400]   So in certain areas of understanding reality,
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:29.040]   we've made extraordinary progress, I would say,
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.520]   in understanding fundamental physical processes
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.680]   and getting very precise equations
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.480]   that really work and allow us to do
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.520]   profound sculpting of matter,
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.240]   to make computers and iPhones and everything else,
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.120]   and they really work,
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.020]   and they're extraordinary productions.
[00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:53.200]   And that's all based on the laws of quantum mechanics,
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.640]   and they really work,
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:00.640]   and they give us tremendous control of nature.
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.800]   On the other hand, as we get better answers,
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.240]   we can also ask more ambitious questions,
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:11.160]   and there are certainly things that have been observed,
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.320]   even in what would be usually called the realm of physics
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.920]   that aren't understood.
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:21.120]   For instance, there seems to be another source of mass
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.640]   in the universe, the so-called dark matter,
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.080]   that we don't know what it is,
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.480]   and it's a very interesting question what it is.
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:33.320]   But also, as you were alluding to,
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:36.680]   it's one thing to know the basic equations,
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.880]   it's another thing to be able to solve them
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.200]   in important cases.
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.440]   So we run up against the limits of that
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:46.980]   in things like chemistry,
[00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:49.680]   where we'd like to be able to design molecules
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.220]   and predict their behavior from the equations.
[00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:55.240]   We think the equations could do that in principle,
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:08:00.240]   but in practice, it's very challenging to solve them
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.640]   in all but very simple cases.
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:06.320]   And then there's the other thing,
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.740]   which is that a lot of what we're interested in
[00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:11.480]   is historically conditioned.
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:15.420]   It's not a matter of the fundamental equations,
[00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:19.920]   but about what has evolved or come out
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:23.600]   of the early universe and formed into people and frogs
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.240]   and societies and things.
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:30.120]   And the basic laws of physics only take you so far
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.660]   in that it kind of provides a foundation,
[00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:35.720]   but you need entirely different concepts
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:39.740]   to deal with those kind of systems.
[00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:44.740]   And one thing I can say about that
[00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:48.880]   is that the laws themselves point out their limitations,
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:53.340]   that they're laws for dynamical evolution.
[00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:55.080]   So they tell you what happens
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.660]   if you have a certain starting point,
[00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:59.760]   but they don't tell you what the starting point should be,
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.680]   at least, yeah.
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.960]   And the other thing that emerges
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:09.960]   from the equations themselves is the phenomena of chaos
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:15.080]   and sensitivity to initial conditions,
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:20.080]   which tells us that there are intrinsic limitations
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:25.200]   on how well we can spell out the consequences of the laws
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.320]   if we try to apply them.
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.480]   - It's the old apple pie.
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:31.400]   If you wanna, what is it, make an apple pie from scratch,
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:34.280]   you have to build the universe or something like that.
[00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:37.280]   - Well, you're much better off starting with apples
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.800]   than starting with quarks, let's put it that way.
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.680]   - In your book, "A Beautiful Question,"
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:44.920]   you ask, "Does the world embody beautiful ideas?"
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:47.240]   So the book is centered around this
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:48.760]   very interesting question.
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:49.600]   It's like Shakespeare.
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.720]   You can dig in and read into all the different
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.480]   interpretations of this question.
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:56.920]   But at the high level, what to use the connection
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:01.920]   between beauty of the world and physics of the world?
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.880]   - In a sense, we now have a lot of insight
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.880]   into what the laws are, the form they take
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:12.240]   that allow us to understand matter in great depth
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.500]   and control it, as we've discussed.
[00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:21.600]   And it's an extraordinary thing how mathematically ideal
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:26.620]   those equations turn out to be.
[00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:29.680]   In the early days of Greek philosophy,
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:35.800]   Plato had this model of atoms built out of the five
[00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:38.040]   perfectly symmetrical platonic solids.
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:42.320]   So there was somehow the idea that mathematical symmetry
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:43.960]   should govern the world.
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:48.960]   And we've out-Platoed Plato by far in modern physics
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:52.280]   because we have symmetries that are much more extensive,
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:56.700]   much more powerful, that turn out to be the ingredients
[00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:59.140]   out of which we construct our theory of the world.
[00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:00.260]   And it works.
[00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:06.780]   So that's certainly beautiful.
[00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:11.780]   So the idea of symmetry, which is a driving inspiration
[00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:18.780]   in much of human art, especially decorative art,
[00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:21.960]   like the Alhambra or in wallpaper designs
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.960]   or things you see around you everywhere,
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:27.980]   also turns out to be the dominant theme
[00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:30.440]   in modern fundamental physics,
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.520]   symmetry and its manifestations.
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:34.480]   The laws turn out to be very,
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.520]   to have these tremendous amounts of symmetry.
[00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:38.880]   You can change the symbols and move them around
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:42.340]   in different ways and they still have the same consequences.
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:48.500]   So that's beautiful.
[00:11:48.500 --> 00:12:00.540]   These concepts that humans find appealing
[00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:03.180]   also turn out to be the concepts
[00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:05.620]   that govern how the world actually works.
[00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:09.060]   I don't think that's an accident.
[00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:13.660]   I think humans were evolved to be able to interact
[00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:17.720]   with the world in ways that are advantageous
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.200]   and to learn from it.
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:22.160]   And so we are naturally evolved or designed
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:26.880]   to enjoy beauty and to symmetry and the world has it.
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:31.040]   And that's why we resonate with it.
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:33.160]   - Well, it's interesting that the ideas of symmetry
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:38.160]   emerge at many levels of the hierarchy of the universe.
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:42.760]   So you're talking about particles,
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:47.280]   but it also is at the level of chemistry and biology
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:52.280]   and the fact that our cognitive,
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:57.700]   sort of our perception system and whatever our cognition is
[00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.500]   also finds it appealing.
[00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:02.980]   Or somehow our sense of what is beautiful
[00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:05.180]   is grounded in this idea of symmetry
[00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:06.760]   or the breaking of symmetry.
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.500]   Symmetry is at the core of our conception of beauty,
[00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:10.540]   whether it's the breaking
[00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:12.980]   or the non-breaking of the symmetry.
[00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:17.980]   It makes you wonder why, why?
[00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:23.740]   Like, so I come from Russia and the question of Dostoevsky,
[00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:27.020]   he has said that beauty will save the world.
[00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:29.540]   Maybe as a physicist you can tell me
[00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:31.380]   what do you think he meant by that?
[00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:32.980]   - I don't know if it saves the world,
[00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:35.700]   but it does turn out to be a tremendous source
[00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:37.500]   of insight into the world.
[00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:42.500]   When we investigate kind of the most fundamental
[00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:46.100]   interactions, things that are hard to access
[00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:48.460]   because they occur at very short distances
[00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:53.460]   between very special kinds of particles
[00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:59.020]   whose properties are only revealed at high energies,
[00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:03.940]   we don't have much to go on from everyday life.
[00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:06.060]   But so we have, when we guess what the,
[00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:08.620]   and the experiments are difficult to do,
[00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:13.620]   so you can't really follow a very wholly empirical procedure
[00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:19.740]   to sort of in the Baconian style figure out the laws
[00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:23.180]   kind of step by step just by accumulating a lot of data.
[00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:25.940]   What we actually do is guess.
[00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:29.400]   And the guesses are kind of aesthetic, really.
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.500]   What would be a nice description
[00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:34.140]   that's consistent with what we know?
[00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:36.260]   And then you try it out and see if it works.
[00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:41.260]   And by gosh, it does in many profound cases.
[00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:46.060]   So there's that, but there's another source of symmetry
[00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:51.060]   which I didn't talk so much about in A Beautiful Question,
[00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:56.840]   but does relate to your comments.
[00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:01.840]   And I think very much relates to the source of symmetry
[00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:06.960]   that we find in biology and in our heads, in our brain,
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:14.340]   which is that, although, well,
[00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:18.100]   it is discussed a bit in A Beautiful Question
[00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:23.100]   and also in fundamentals, is that when you have,
[00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:30.300]   symmetry is also a very important means of construction.
[00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:34.500]   So when you have, for instance, simple viruses
[00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:39.340]   that need to construct their coat, their protein coat,
[00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:42.220]   the coats often take the form of platonic solids.
[00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:47.060]   And the reason is that the viruses are really dumb
[00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:48.980]   and they only know how to do one thing.
[00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:51.580]   So they make a pentagon, then they make another pentagon,
[00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:52.580]   and they make another pentagon,
[00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:55.380]   and they all glue together in the same way.
[00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:58.940]   And that makes a very symmetrical object.
[00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:02.060]   So the rules of development, when you have simple rules
[00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:07.060]   and they work again and again, you get symmetrical patterns.
[00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:09.740]   That's kind of, in fact, it's a recipe also
[00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:14.740]   for generating fractals, like the kind of broccoli
[00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:19.340]   that has all this internal structure.
[00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:20.740]   And I wish I had a picture to show,
[00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:25.740]   but maybe people remember it from the supermarket.
[00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:30.020]   And you say, how did a vegetable get so intelligent
[00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:31.620]   to make such a beautiful object
[00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:33.500]   with all this fractal structure?
[00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:35.940]   And the secret is stupidity.
[00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:38.580]   You just do the same thing over and over again.
[00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:43.120]   And in our brains also, we came out,
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:47.480]   we start from single cells and they reproduce,
[00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:51.860]   and each one does roughly the same thing.
[00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:56.780]   The program evolves in time, of course,
[00:16:56.780 --> 00:17:01.060]   different modules get turned on and off,
[00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:03.460]   genetic, different regions of the genetic code
[00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:04.780]   get turned on and off.
[00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:08.780]   But basically, a lot of the same things are going on,
[00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:09.740]   and they're simple things,
[00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:12.460]   and so you produce the same patterns over and over again,
[00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:14.540]   and that's a recipe for producing symmetry,
[00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:17.140]   'cause you're getting the same thing in many, many places.
[00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:20.860]   And if you look at, for instance,
[00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:24.860]   the beautiful drawings of Rahman Iqbal,
[00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:29.220]   the great neuroanatomist who drew the structure
[00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:33.380]   of different organs like the hippocampus,
[00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:37.820]   you see it's very regular and very intricate,
[00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:42.820]   and it's symmetry in that sense.
[00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:46.860]   It's 'cause it's many repeated units
[00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:49.580]   that you can take from one place to the other
[00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:51.860]   and see that they look more or less the same.
[00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:54.300]   - But when you're describing this kind of beauty
[00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:55.540]   that we're talking about now,
[00:17:55.540 --> 00:18:00.540]   it's a very small sample in terms of space-time
[00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:01.940]   in a very big world,
[00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:08.020]   in a very short, brief moment in this long history.
[00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:11.420]   In your book, "Fundamentals, 10 Keys to Reality,"
[00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:13.460]   I'd really recommend people read it,
[00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:20.340]   you say that space and time are pretty big, or very big.
[00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:21.740]   How big are we talking about?
[00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:28.020]   Can you tell a brief history of space and time?
[00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:30.020]   - It's easy to tell a brief history
[00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:33.380]   if the details get very involved, of course.
[00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:35.500]   But one thing I like to say is that
[00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:38.460]   if you take a broad enough view,
[00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:40.140]   the history of the universe is simpler
[00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:41.740]   than the history of Sweden, say.
[00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:45.220]   Because your standards are lower.
[00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:50.900]   But just to make it quantitative,
[00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:52.700]   I'll just give a few highlights.
[00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:57.460]   And it's a little bit easier to talk about time,
[00:18:57.460 --> 00:18:59.220]   so let's start with that.
[00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:02.020]   The Big Bang occurred, we think,
[00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:05.740]   the universe was much hotter and denser and more uniform
[00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:09.020]   about 13.8 billion years ago,
[00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:10.860]   and that's what we call the Big Bang.
[00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:14.420]   And it's been expanding and cooling,
[00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:18.060]   the matter in it has been expanding and cooling ever since.
[00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:22.620]   So in a real sense, the universe is 13.8 billion years old.
[00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:26.580]   That's a big number, kind of hard to think about.
[00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:28.460]   A nice way to think about it, though,
[00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:31.460]   is to map it onto one year.
[00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:33.940]   So let's say the universe,
[00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:36.100]   just linearly map the time intervals
[00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:39.940]   from 13.8 billion years onto one year.
[00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:44.940]   So the Big Bang then is on January 1st at 12 a.m.
[00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:51.260]   And you wait for quite a long time
[00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:53.900]   before the dinosaurs emerge.
[00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:57.060]   The dinosaurs emerge on Christmas, it turns out.
[00:19:57.060 --> 00:20:00.180]   - 12 months, almost 12 months later.
[00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:01.900]   - Getting close to the end, yes.
[00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:03.540]   - Getting close to the end.
[00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:07.960]   - And the extinction event that let the mammals
[00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:11.180]   and ultimately humans inherit the Earth
[00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:15.660]   from the dinosaurs occurred on December 30th.
[00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:20.820]   And all of human history is a small part of the last day.
[00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:25.820]   And so yes, so we're occupying only,
[00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:29.340]   and a human lifetime is a very, very infinitesimal part
[00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:34.340]   of this interval, of these gigantic cosmic reaches of time.
[00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:41.780]   And in space, we can tell a very similar story.
[00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:45.780]   In fact, it's convenient to think
[00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:49.660]   that the size of the universe is the distance
[00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:52.780]   that light can travel in 13.8 billion years.
[00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:56.580]   That's so 13.8 billion light years.
[00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:59.180]   That's how far you can see out.
[00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:03.620]   That's how far signals can reach us.
[00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:08.620]   And that is a big distance,
[00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:14.740]   because compared to that, the Earth
[00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:18.140]   is a fraction of a light second.
[00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:21.540]   So again, it's really, really big.
[00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:26.540]   And so we have, if we wanna think about the universe
[00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:29.360]   as a whole in space and time,
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:35.020]   we really need a different kind of imagination.
[00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:38.660]   It's not something you can grasp
[00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:43.620]   in terms of psychological time.
[00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:45.500]   In a useful way, you have to think,
[00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:48.700]   you have to use exponential notation and abstract concepts
[00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:53.700]   to really get any hold on these vast times and spaces.
[00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:58.100]   On the other hand, let me hasten to add
[00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:00.520]   that that doesn't make us small,
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:06.580]   or make the time that we have to us small,
[00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:10.660]   because again, looking at those pictures
[00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:15.480]   of what our minds are, and some of the components
[00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:18.620]   of our minds, these beautiful drawings
[00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:21.180]   of the cellular patterns inside the brain,
[00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:24.820]   you see that there are many, many, many processing units.
[00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:29.740]   And if you analyze how fast they operate,
[00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:31.660]   I try to estimate how many thoughts
[00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:33.340]   a person can have in a lifetime.
[00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:34.740]   That's kind of a fuzzy question,
[00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:36.740]   but I'm very proud that I was able
[00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:39.460]   to define it pretty precisely.
[00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:43.620]   And it turns out we have time for billions
[00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:46.980]   of meaningful thoughts in a lifetime.
[00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:48.540]   So it's a lot.
[00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:51.840]   We shouldn't think of ourselves as terribly small,
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:56.280]   either in space or in time, because although we're small
[00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:59.200]   in those dimensions compared to the universe,
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:03.760]   we're large compared to meaningful units
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:08.080]   of processing information and being able
[00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:10.200]   to conceptualize and understand things.
[00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:15.120]   - Yeah, but 99% of those thoughts are probably food,
[00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:16.840]   sex, or internet-related.
[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:20.540]   - Well, yeah, well, yeah, well, they're not necessarily.
[00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:24.100]   - Only like 0.1 is Nobel Prize-winning ideas.
[00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:26.460]   - That's true, but there's more to life
[00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:27.740]   than winning Nobel Prizes.
[00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:29.860]   - How did you do that calculation?
[00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:31.380]   Can you maybe break that apart a little bit,
[00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:34.020]   just kind of for fun, sort of an intuition
[00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:35.940]   of how we calculate the number of thoughts?
[00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:38.180]   - The number of thoughts, right.
[00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:40.540]   It's necessarily imprecise, because a lot
[00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:42.100]   of things are going on in different ways.
[00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:43.260]   What is a thought?
[00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:45.900]   But there are several things that point
[00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:50.900]   to more or less the same rate of being able
[00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:52.700]   to have meaningful thoughts.
[00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:56.760]   For instance, the one that I think
[00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:01.380]   is maybe the most penetrating is how fast
[00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:04.380]   we can process visual images.
[00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:05.660]   How do we do that?
[00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:11.340]   If you've ever watched old movies,
[00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:15.140]   you can see that, well, any movie, in fact,
[00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:18.060]   that a motion picture is really not a motion picture.
[00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:20.540]   It's a series of snapshots that are playing
[00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:21.900]   one after the other.
[00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:26.520]   And it's because our brains also work that way.
[00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:28.500]   We take snapshots of the world,
[00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:29.940]   integrate over a certain time,
[00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:31.120]   and then go on to the next one.
[00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:34.580]   And then by post-processing, create the illusion
[00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:38.380]   of continuity and flow, we can deal with that.
[00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:43.380]   And if the flicker rate is too slow,
[00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:48.660]   then you start to see that it's a series of snapshots.
[00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:51.060]   And you can ask, what is the crossover?
[00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:53.100]   When does it change from being something
[00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:57.460]   that is matched to our processing speed versus too fast?
[00:24:57.460 --> 00:25:00.460]   And it turns out about 40 per second.
[00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:03.060]   And then if you take 40 per second
[00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:06.860]   as how fast we can process visual images,
[00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:09.420]   you get to several billions of thoughts.
[00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:13.780]   If you, similarly, if you ask,
[00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:16.940]   what are some of the fastest things that people can do?
[00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:18.660]   Well, they can play video games,
[00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:22.460]   they can play the piano very fast if they're skilled at it.
[00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:25.300]   And again, you get to similar units.
[00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:27.220]   Or how fast can people talk?
[00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:30.100]   You get to, within a couple of orders of magnitude,
[00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:32.700]   you get more or less to the same idea.
[00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:39.500]   So that's how you can say that there's billions of,
[00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:42.780]   there's room for billions of meaningful thoughts.
[00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:47.580]   I won't argue for exactly two billion versus 1.8 billion.
[00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:49.340]   It's not that kind of question.
[00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:52.780]   But I think any estimate that's reasonable
[00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:57.780]   will come out within, say, 100 billion and 100 million.
[00:25:58.140 --> 00:25:59.820]   So it's a lot.
[00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:04.100]   - It would be interesting to map out
[00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:07.260]   for an individual human being the landscape of thoughts
[00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:09.280]   that they've sort of traveled.
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:12.920]   If you think of thoughts as a set of trajectories,
[00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:16.340]   what that landscape looks like.
[00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:20.100]   I mean, I've been recently really thinking about
[00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:24.740]   this Richard Dawkins idea of memes
[00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:27.800]   and just all this ideas and the evolution of ideas
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:29.860]   inside of one particular human mind
[00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:33.700]   and how they're then changed and evolved
[00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:36.500]   by interaction with other human beings.
[00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:38.060]   It's interesting to think about.
[00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:41.860]   So if you think the number is billions,
[00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:44.340]   you think there's also social interaction.
[00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:48.660]   So these aren't, like there's interaction
[00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:50.740]   in the same way you have interaction with particles.
[00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:52.980]   There's interaction between human thoughts.
[00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:56.380]   Perhaps that interaction in itself
[00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:59.120]   is fundamental to the process of thinking.
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:01.380]   Like without social interaction,
[00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:04.100]   we would be stuck like walking in a circle.
[00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:07.360]   We need the perturbation of other humans
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:09.600]   to create change and evolution.
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:13.320]   - Once you bring in concepts of interactions
[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:15.880]   and correlations and relations,
[00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:19.300]   then you have what's called a combinatorial explosion.
[00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:22.920]   That the number of possibilities
[00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:24.960]   expands exponentially, technically,
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:28.920]   with the number of things you're considering.
[00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:33.200]   And it can easily, rapidly outstrip
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:36.800]   these billions of thoughts that we're talking about.
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:41.680]   So we definitely cannot by brute force
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:44.440]   master complex situations
[00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:48.920]   or think of all the possibilities in a complex situations.
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:52.520]   I mean, even something as relatively simple as chess
[00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:56.280]   is still something that human beings
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:57.840]   can't comprehend completely.
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:00.920]   Even the best players lose, still sometimes lose,
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:05.100]   and they consistently lose to computers these days.
[00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:08.800]   And in computer science, there's a concept of NP-complete.
[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:12.200]   So large classes of problems, when you scale them up
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:16.040]   beyond a few individuals, become intractable.
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:20.960]   And so in that sense, the world is inexhaustible.
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:22.440]   - But and that makes it beautiful
[00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:27.200]   that we can make any laws that generalize
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:31.400]   efficiently and well can compress all of that
[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:33.900]   combinatorial complexity into a simple rule.
[00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:35.360]   That in itself is beautiful.
[00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:38.240]   - It's a happy situation, I think,
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:43.240]   that we can find general principles
[00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:45.760]   sort of of the operating system
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:49.880]   that are comprehensible, simple, extremely powerful,
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:52.720]   and let us control things very well
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:55.420]   and ask profound questions.
[00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:57.000]   And on the other hand, that the world
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.560]   is going to be inexhaustible.
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:03.280]   Once we start asking about relationships
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:07.080]   and how they evolve and social interactions,
[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:10.600]   we'll never have a theory of everything
[00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:12.640]   in any meaningful sense because--
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:15.120]   - Of everything, everything.
[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.620]   Truly everything is.
[00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:19.920]   Can I ask you about the Big Bang?
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:23.460]   So we talked about the space and time are really big,
[00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:27.800]   but then, and we humans give a lot of meaning
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:32.300]   to the word space and time in our daily lives.
[00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:37.320]   But then can we talk about this moment of beginning
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:39.360]   and how we're supposed to think about it?
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:42.440]   That at the moment of the Big Bang,
[00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:46.640]   everything was what, like infinitely small?
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:48.760]   And then it just blew up?
[00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:49.840]   - We have to be careful here
[00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:53.480]   'cause there's a common misconception
[00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:58.480]   that the Big Bang is like the explosion of a bomb
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:02.920]   in empty space that fills up the surrounding place.
[00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:03.920]   - It is space.
[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:05.280]   - It is, yeah.
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:08.920]   As we understand it, it's the fact,
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:12.240]   it's the fact or the hypothesis,
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:14.760]   but well-supported up to a point,
[00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:19.760]   that everywhere in the whole universe,
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:23.160]   early in the history,
[00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:28.120]   matter came together into a very hot, very dense,
[00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:29.920]   if you run it backwards in time,
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:32.720]   matter comes together into a very hot, very dense,
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:36.240]   and yet very homogeneous plasma
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:39.480]   of all the different kinds of elementary particles
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:41.840]   and quarks and antiquarks and gluons and photons
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:43.840]   and electrons and anti-electrons, everything,
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:45.120]   all of that stuff.
[00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:48.560]   - Like really hot, really, really dense.
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:49.400]   - Really hot.
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:52.080]   We're talking about way, way hotter
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:53.620]   than the surface of the sun.
[00:30:53.620 --> 00:31:00.640]   In fact, if you take the equations as they come,
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:02.920]   the prediction is that the temperature
[00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:07.000]   just goes to infinity, but then the equations break down.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.920]   The equations become infinity equals infinity,
[00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:15.080]   so they don't feel, it's called a singularity.
[00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:16.200]   We don't really know.
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:19.640]   This is running the equations backwards,
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:21.760]   so you can't really get a sensible idea
[00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:24.360]   of what happened before the Big Bang.
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:25.600]   We need different equations
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:28.340]   to address the very earliest moments.
[00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:35.600]   So things were hotter and denser.
[00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:40.600]   We don't really know why things started out that way.
[00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:43.960]   We have a lot of evidence that they did start out that way,
[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:47.840]   but since most of the,
[00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:55.400]   we don't get to visit there and do controlled experiments.
[00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:59.560]   Most of the record is very, very processed,
[00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:04.560]   and we have to use very subtle techniques
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:09.440]   and powerful instruments to get information
[00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:11.080]   that has survived.
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:12.800]   - Get closer and closer to the Big Bang.
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:16.480]   - Get closer and closer to the beginning of things.
[00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:23.200]   What's revealed there is that, as I said,
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:26.120]   there undoubtedly was a period when everything
[00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:29.560]   in the universe that we have been able to look at
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:33.400]   and understand, and that's consistent with everything,
[00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:41.360]   was in a condition where it was much, much hotter
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:43.000]   and much, much denser,
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.320]   but still obeying the laws of physics
[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:47.560]   as we know them today.
[00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:51.080]   And then you start with that,
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:53.140]   so all the matter is in equilibrium,
[00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:57.920]   and then with small quantum fluctuations
[00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:01.720]   and run it forward, and then it produces,
[00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:04.000]   at least in broad strokes,
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.600]   the universe we see around us today.
[00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:09.200]   - Do you think we'll ever be able to,
[00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:12.640]   with the tools of physics, with the way science is,
[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:14.040]   with the way the human mind is,
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:17.680]   we'll ever be able to get to the moment of the Big Bang
[00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:21.720]   in our understanding, or even the moment before the Big Bang?
[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:24.720]   Can we understand what happened before the Big Bang?
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:29.720]   - I'm optimistic both that we'll be able to measure more,
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:35.900]   so observe more, and that we'll be able to figure out more.
[00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:40.660]   So there are very, very tangible prospects
[00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:45.660]   for observing the extremely early universe,
[00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:49.420]   so even much earlier than we can observe now,
[00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:52.220]   through looking at gravitational waves.
[00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:55.660]   Gravitational waves, since they interact so weakly
[00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:57.300]   with ordinary matter,
[00:33:57.300 --> 00:34:03.620]   sort of send a minimally processed signal from the Big Bang.
[00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:07.340]   It's a very weak signal, because it's traveled a long way
[00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:09.420]   and diffused over long spaces,
[00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:13.300]   but people are gearing up to try to detect
[00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:15.180]   gravitational waves that could have come
[00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:16.300]   from the early universe.
[00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:19.100]   - Yeah, LIGO's incredible engineering project,
[00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:24.100]   just the most sensitive, precise devices on Earth.
[00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:27.500]   The fact that humans can build something like that
[00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:31.300]   is truly awe-inspiring from an engineering perspective.
[00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:33.940]   - Right, but these gravitational waves
[00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:36.500]   from the early universe will probably be
[00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:41.460]   of a much longer wavelength than LIGO is capable of sensing,
[00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:46.460]   so there's a beautiful project that's contemplated
[00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:53.340]   to put lasers in different locations in the solar system.
[00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:59.100]   We really, really separated by solar system scale
[00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:02.220]   differences, like artificial planets or moons
[00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:05.540]   in different places, and see the tiny motions
[00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:07.900]   of those relative to one another as a signal
[00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:10.060]   of radiation from the Big Bang.
[00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:15.060]   We can also maybe indirectly see the imprint
[00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:18.300]   of gravitational waves from the early universe
[00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:22.740]   on the photons, the microwave background radiation
[00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:25.940]   that is our present way of seeing
[00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:27.200]   into the earliest universe.
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:30.820]   But those photons interact much more strongly
[00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:32.940]   with matter, they're much more strongly processed,
[00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:37.940]   so they don't give us directly such an unprocessed view
[00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:41.100]   of the early universe, of the very early universe.
[00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:45.020]   But if gravitational waves leave some imprint
[00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:49.380]   on that as they move through, we could detect that too,
[00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:53.180]   and people are trying, as we speak,
[00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:56.860]   working very hard towards that goal.
[00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:58.980]   - It's so exciting to think about a sensor
[00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:00.560]   the size of a solar system.
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:03.500]   - That would be a fantastic, I mean,
[00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:07.540]   that would be a pinnacle artifact of human endeavor to me.
[00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:11.860]   It would be such an inspiring thing
[00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:15.900]   that just we want to know, and we go
[00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:19.360]   to these extraordinary lengths of making gigantic things
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:20.820]   that are also very sophisticated,
[00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:22.200]   because what you're trying to do,
[00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:24.920]   you have to understand how they move,
[00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:27.980]   you have to understand the properties of light
[00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:30.860]   that are being used, the interference between light,
[00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:34.140]   and you have to be able to make the light with lasers
[00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:35.700]   and understand the quantum theory
[00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:38.020]   and get the timing exactly right.
[00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:41.660]   It's an extraordinary endeavor involving all kinds
[00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:45.060]   of knowledge from the very small to the very large,
[00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:49.020]   and all in the service of curiosity
[00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:53.020]   and built on a grand scale, so yeah.
[00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:58.320]   - Yeah, it'd make me proud to be a human if we did that.
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:01.280]   - I love that you're inspired both by the power of theory
[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:04.560]   and the power of experiment, so both, I think,
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:08.640]   are exceptionally impressive that the human mind
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:11.600]   can come up with theories that give us a peek
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:15.160]   into how the universe works, but also construct tools
[00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:19.920]   that are way bigger than the evolutionary origins
[00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:22.000]   we came from. - Right, and by the way,
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.680]   the fact that we can design such things and they work
[00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:28.160]   is an extraordinary demonstration
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:30.600]   that we really do understand a lot.
[00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:34.340]   - And in some ways-- - And it's our ability
[00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:37.820]   to answer questions that also leads us to be able
[00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:39.800]   to address more ambitious questions.
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:44.180]   - So you mentioned that at the Big Bang in the early days,
[00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:47.840]   things are pretty homogeneous. - Yes.
[00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:51.640]   - But here we are, sitting on Earth,
[00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:56.640]   two hairless apes, you could say, with microphones.
[00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:58.820]   In talking about the brief history of things,
[00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:00.800]   you said it's much harder to describe Sweden
[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:05.360]   than it is the universe, so there's a lot of complexity.
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:07.440]   There's a lot of interesting details here,
[00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:11.000]   so how does this complexity come to be, do you think?
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.500]   It seems like there's these pockets.
[00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:14.800]   - Yeah. - We don't know how rare
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:18.860]   of where hairless apes just emerge.
[00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:20.280]   - Yeah. - And then,
[00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:23.520]   that came from the initial soup that was homogeneous.
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:26.480]   Was that, is that an accident?
[00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:31.480]   - Well, we understand in broad outlines how it could happen.
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:36.360]   We certainly don't understand why it happened exactly
[00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:41.360]   in the way it did, but there are certainly open questions
[00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:45.640]   about the origins of life and how inevitable
[00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:48.920]   the emergence of intelligence was and how that happened.
[00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:52.160]   But in the very broadest terms,
[00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:58.000]   the universe early on was quite homogeneous,
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.120]   but not completely homogeneous.
[00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:07.040]   There were part in 10,000 fluctuations in density
[00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:12.040]   within this primordial plasma, and as time goes on,
[00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:17.640]   there's an instability which causes
[00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:20.120]   those density contrasts to increase.
[00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:21.680]   There's a gravitational instability.
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:24.600]   Where it's denser, the gravitational attractions
[00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:27.240]   are stronger, and so that brings in more matter,
[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:29.760]   and it gets even denser, and so on and so on.
[00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:34.360]   So there's a natural tendency of matter to clump
[00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:37.160]   because of gravitational interactions.
[00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:40.160]   And then the equation gets complicated
[00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:42.860]   when you have lots of things clumping together.
[00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:47.020]   Then we know what the laws are,
[00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:49.120]   but we have to, to a certain extent,
[00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:51.840]   wave our hands about what happens.
[00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:56.840]   But basic understanding of chemistry says that if things,
[00:39:56.840 --> 00:40:00.600]   and the physics of radiation tells us
[00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:02.800]   that as things start to clump together,
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:05.500]   they can radiate, give off some energy,
[00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:08.520]   so they slow down, and as a result,
[00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:11.040]   they lose energy, they can clumber together,
[00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:14.000]   cool down, form things like stars,
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.300]   form things like planets, and so in broad terms,
[00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:19.360]   there's no mystery.
[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:25.440]   That's what the equations tell you should happen,
[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:30.560]   but because it's a process involving
[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:33.680]   many, many individual units,
[00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:39.560]   the application of the laws that govern
[00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:44.560]   individual units to these things is very delicate,
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:48.200]   or computationally very difficult,
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:52.000]   and more profoundly, the equations have
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.320]   this probability of chaos,
[00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:55.260]   or sensitivity to initial conditions,
[00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:58.880]   which tells you tiny differences in the initial state
[00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:02.400]   can lead to enormous differences in the subsequent behavior.
[00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:07.400]   So physics, fundamental physics at some point says,
[00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:11.780]   okay, chemists, biologists, this is your problem.
[00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:16.640]   And then again, in broad terms,
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:21.640]   we know how it's conceivable that humans
[00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:24.660]   and things like that can,
[00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:28.120]   how complex structure can emerge.
[00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:33.120]   It's a matter of having the right kind of temperature
[00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:36.280]   and the right kind of stuff,
[00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:41.280]   so you need to be able to make chemical bonds
[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:42.840]   that are reasonably stable,
[00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:45.360]   and be able to make complex structures.
[00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:48.680]   And we're very fortunate that carbon has this ability
[00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:53.680]   to make backbones and elaborate branchings and things,
[00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:57.560]   so you can get complex things that we call biochemistry,
[00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:01.120]   and yet the bonds can be broken a little bit
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:04.720]   with the help of energetic injections from the sun,
[00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:07.400]   so you have to have both the possibility of changing,
[00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:10.560]   but also the useful degree of stability.
[00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:14.000]   And we know at that very, very broad level,
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.760]   physics can tell you that it's conceivable.
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:19.840]   If you want to know what actually,
[00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:24.120]   what really happened, what really can happen,
[00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:27.000]   then you have to work, go to chemistry.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.800]   If you want to know what actually happened,
[00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:31.320]   then you really have to consult
[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:33.200]   the fossil record and biologists.
[00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:38.200]   And so, but it's, so these ways of addressing the issue
[00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:43.480]   are complementary in a sense.
[00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:48.480]   They use different kinds of concepts,
[00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:52.440]   they use different languages,
[00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:54.320]   and they address different kinds of questions,
[00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:59.320]   but they're not inconsistent, they're just complementary.
[00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:01.000]   - It's kind of interesting to think about
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   those early fluctuations as our earliest ancestors.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.160]   - Yes, that's right.
[00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:11.360]   So it's amazing to think that, you know,
[00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:16.820]   this is the modern answer to the,
[00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:23.880]   well, the modern version of what the Hindu philosophers had,
[00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:25.680]   that art thou.
[00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:30.440]   If you ask, okay, that, those little quantum fluctuations
[00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:34.600]   in the early universe are the seeds out of which complexity,
[00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:40.840]   including plausibly humans, really evolve.
[00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:42.200]   You don't need anything else.
[00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:47.200]   - That brings up the question of asking for a friend here,
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:52.080]   if there's, you know, other pockets of complexity,
[00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:58.040]   commonly called as alien intelligent civilizations out there.
[00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:00.880]   - Well, we don't know for sure,
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:05.700]   but I have a strong suspicion that the answer is yes,
[00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:10.700]   because the one case we do have at hand to study
[00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:17.680]   here on Earth, we sort of know what the conditions were
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:18.840]   that were helpful to life,
[00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:21.680]   the right kind of temperature, the right kind of star
[00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:24.240]   that keeps, maintains that temperature for a long time,
[00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:26.380]   the liquid environment of water.
[00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:33.360]   And once those conditions emerged on Earth,
[00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:36.000]   which was roughly four and a half billion years ago,
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.640]   it wasn't very long before what we call life
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:41.520]   started to leave relics.
[00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:46.520]   So we can find forms of life, primitive forms of life
[00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:49.940]   that are almost as old as the Earth itself,
[00:44:49.940 --> 00:44:53.160]   in the sense that once the Earth became,
[00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:58.640]   was turned from a very hot boiling thing
[00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:02.480]   and cooled off into a solid mass with water,
[00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:03.920]   life emerged very, very quickly.
[00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:07.800]   So it seems that these general conditions for life
[00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:13.860]   are enough to make it happen relatively quickly.
[00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:19.880]   Now, the other lesson I think that one can draw
[00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:22.560]   from this one example,
[00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:25.280]   it's dangerous to draw lessons from one example,
[00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:26.820]   but that's all we've got.
[00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:32.020]   And that the emergence of intelligent life
[00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:34.220]   is a different issue altogether.
[00:45:34.220 --> 00:45:36.800]   That took a long time
[00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:42.140]   and seems to have been pretty contingent.
[00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:50.560]   For a long time, well, for most of the history of life,
[00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:54.020]   it was single-celled things.
[00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:58.000]   Even multicellular life only rose
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.520]   about 600 million years ago, so much after.
[00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:09.680]   And then intelligence is kind of a luxury,
[00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:11.280]   if you think.
[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:17.520]   Many more kinds of creatures have big stomachs
[00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:20.200]   than big brains.
[00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:23.520]   In fact, most have no brains at all
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:25.320]   in any reasonable sense.
[00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:30.140]   And the dinosaurs ruled for a long, long time,
[00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:31.480]   and some of them were pretty smart,
[00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:35.260]   but they were at best bird brains
[00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:37.720]   because birds came from the dinosaurs.
[00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:41.860]   And it could have stayed that way.
[00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:46.240]   And the emergence of humans was very contingent
[00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:49.560]   and kind of a very, very recent development
[00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:51.800]   on evolutionary timescales.
[00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:55.040]   And you can argue about the level of human intelligence,
[00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:56.720]   but I think it's--
[00:46:56.720 --> 00:46:57.560]   - Pretty impressive.
[00:46:57.560 --> 00:46:58.400]   - That's what we're talking about.
[00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:00.360]   And it's very impressive,
[00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:02.280]   and can ask these kinds of questions
[00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:04.000]   and discuss them intelligently.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:12.040]   So I guess my, so this is a long-winded answer
[00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:17.600]   or justification of my feeling is that
[00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:23.440]   the conditions for life in some form
[00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:28.680]   are probably satisfied in many, many places
[00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:32.100]   around the universe, and even within our galaxy.
[00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:36.040]   I'm not so sure about the emergence of intelligent life
[00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:41.800]   or the emergence of technological civilizations.
[00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:46.800]   That seems much more contingent and special
[00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:50.360]   and we might, it's conceivable to me
[00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:52.840]   that we're the only example in the galaxy.
[00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:56.640]   Although, yeah, I don't know one way or the other.
[00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:59.600]   I have different opinions on different days of the week.
[00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:01.400]   - But one of the things that worries me
[00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:04.640]   in the spirit of being humble,
[00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:08.000]   that our particular kind of intelligence
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.680]   is not very special.
[00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:13.680]   So there's all kinds of different intelligences.
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:15.000]   And even more broadly,
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:19.080]   there could be many different kinds of life.
[00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:22.440]   So the basic definition, and I just had,
[00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:24.840]   I think somebody that you know, Sarah Walker,
[00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:27.280]   I just had a very long conversation with her
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:29.360]   about even just the very basic question
[00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:32.360]   of trying to define what is life
[00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:34.580]   from a physics perspective.
[00:48:34.580 --> 00:48:36.080]   Even that question within itself,
[00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:38.160]   I think one of the most fundamental questions
[00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:41.080]   in science and physics and everything
[00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:43.760]   is just trying to get a hold,
[00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:45.480]   trying to get some universal laws
[00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:47.400]   around the ideas of what is life.
[00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:49.640]   'Cause that kind of unlocks a bunch of things
[00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:52.400]   around life, intelligence, consciousness,
[00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:53.400]   all those kinds of things.
[00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:55.000]   - I agree with you in a sense,
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:56.520]   but I think that's a dangerous question
[00:48:56.520 --> 00:49:01.520]   because the answer can't be any more precise
[00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:02.880]   than the question.
[00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:06.120]   And the question what is life
[00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:11.280]   kind of assumes that we have a definition of life
[00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:12.880]   and that it's a natural phenomena
[00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:14.600]   that can be distinguished.
[00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:17.520]   But really there are edge cases like viruses
[00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:20.720]   and some people would like to say
[00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:24.960]   that electrons have consciousness.
[00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:28.640]   So you can't, if you really have fuzzy concepts,
[00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:33.640]   it's very hard to reach precise kinds of scientific answers.
[00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:36.960]   But I think there's a very fruitful question
[00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:40.960]   that's adjacent to it, which has been pursued
[00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:44.960]   in different forms for quite a while
[00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:47.800]   and is now becoming very sophisticated
[00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:49.960]   in reaching in new directions.
[00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:53.880]   And that is what are the states of matter
[00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:55.080]   that are possible?
[00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:58.400]   So in high school or grade school,
[00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:01.680]   you learn about solids, liquids and gases,
[00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:04.640]   but that really just scratches the surface
[00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:07.760]   of different ways that are distinguishable,
[00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:12.760]   that matter can form into macroscopically different
[00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:17.360]   meaningful patterns that we call phases.
[00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:19.400]   And then there are precise definitions
[00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:21.640]   of what we mean by phases of matter
[00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:26.080]   and that have been worked out fruitful over the decades.
[00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:29.800]   And we're discovering new states of matter all the time
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:33.240]   and kind of having to work at what we mean by matter.
[00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:35.920]   We're discovering the capabilities of matter
[00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:39.560]   to organize in interesting ways.
[00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:44.560]   And some of them like liquid crystals
[00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:49.000]   are important ingredients of life,
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.680]   our cell membranes are liquid crystals,
[00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:54.040]   and that's very important to the way they work.
[00:50:54.040 --> 00:50:57.320]   Recently, there's been a development
[00:50:57.320 --> 00:51:01.440]   in where we're talking about states of matter
[00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:04.240]   that are not static,
[00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:06.560]   but that have dynamics,
[00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:09.560]   that have characteristic patterns,
[00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:11.500]   not only in space, but in time.
[00:51:11.500 --> 00:51:12.840]   These are called time crystals.
[00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:14.400]   And that's been a development
[00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:17.520]   that's just in the last decade or so,
[00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:20.760]   it's just really, really flourishing.
[00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:25.760]   And so is there a state of matter
[00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:29.480]   or a group of states of matter that corresponds to life?
[00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:34.480]   Maybe, but the answer can't be any more definite
[00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:35.880]   than the question.
[00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:38.760]   - I mean, I gotta push back on the,
[00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:39.920]   those are just words.
[00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:42.000]   I mean, I disagree with you.
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:45.920]   The question points to a direction.
[00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:49.200]   The answer might be able to be more precise
[00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:51.040]   than the question.
[00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:53.440]   Because just as you're saying,
[00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:58.600]   we could be discovering certain characteristics
[00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:00.600]   and patterns that are associated
[00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:04.440]   with a certain type of matter, macroscopically speaking.
[00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:09.440]   And that we can then be able to post facto say,
[00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:13.080]   this is, let's assign the word life
[00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:14.440]   to this kind of matter.
[00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:16.000]   - I agree with that completely.
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:19.800]   That's, so it's not a disagreement.
[00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:22.360]   It's very frequent in physics that,
[00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:26.840]   or in science, that words that are in common use
[00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:31.360]   gets, get refined and reprocessed into scientific terms.
[00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:34.260]   That's happened for things like force and energy.
[00:52:34.260 --> 00:52:38.760]   And so we, in a way, we find out
[00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:43.760]   what the useful definition is, or symmetry, for instance.
[00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:47.240]   And the common usage may be quite different
[00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:48.440]   from the scientific usage,
[00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:52.000]   but the scientific usage is special
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:53.340]   and takes on a life of its own.
[00:52:53.340 --> 00:52:58.340]   And we find out what the useful version of it is,
[00:52:58.340 --> 00:53:02.040]   what the fruitful version of it is.
[00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:05.320]   So I do think, so in that spirit,
[00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:10.320]   I think if we can identify states of matter
[00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:18.000]   or linked states of matter that can carry on processes
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:23.040]   of self-reproduction and development
[00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:27.360]   and information processing,
[00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:30.600]   we should say, we might be tempted
[00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:34.200]   to classify those things as life.
[00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:36.820]   - Well, can I ask you about the craziest one,
[00:53:36.820 --> 00:53:41.540]   which is the one we know maybe least about,
[00:53:41.540 --> 00:53:42.700]   which is consciousness?
[00:53:42.700 --> 00:53:44.960]   Is it possible that there are certain kinds of matter
[00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:49.960]   would be able to classify as conscious,
[00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:54.400]   meaning, so there's the panpsychists, right,
[00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:57.880]   or the philosophers who kind of try to imply
[00:53:57.880 --> 00:54:01.200]   that all matter has some degree of consciousness
[00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:02.460]   and you can almost construct
[00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:04.160]   like a physics of consciousness.
[00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:09.240]   Again, we're in such early days of this,
[00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:13.080]   but nevertheless, it seems useful to talk about.
[00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:15.860]   Is there some sense from a physics perspective
[00:54:15.860 --> 00:54:17.400]   to make sense of consciousness?
[00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:19.680]   Is there some hope?
[00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:21.520]   - Yeah, consciousness is--
[00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:23.400]   - Imprecise.
[00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:27.680]   - A very imprecise word and loaded with connotations
[00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:31.560]   that I think we don't wanna start a scientific analysis
[00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:32.800]   with that, I don't think.
[00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:38.320]   It's often been important in science
[00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:41.680]   to start with simple cases and work up.
[00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:45.840]   Consciousness, I think what most people think of
[00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:47.720]   when you talk about consciousness is,
[00:54:47.720 --> 00:54:52.720]   okay, what am I doing in the world?
[00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:53.840]   This is my experience.
[00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:57.120]   I have a rich inner life and experience,
[00:54:57.120 --> 00:54:59.520]   and where is that in the equations?
[00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:03.400]   I think that's a great question, a great, great question,
[00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:07.720]   and actually, I think I'm gearing up to spend part of the,
[00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:10.960]   I mean, to try to address that in coming years.
[00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:12.640]   - One version of asking that question,
[00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:17.280]   just as you said now, is what is the simplest formulation
[00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:18.560]   of that to study?
[00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:21.520]   - I think I'm much more comfortable with the idea
[00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:25.440]   of studying self-awareness as opposed to consciousness,
[00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:29.160]   'cause that sort of gets rid of the mystical aura
[00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:33.760]   of the thing, and self-awareness is in simple,
[00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:40.560]   I think contiguous, at least, with ideas about feedback.
[00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:45.360]   So if you have a system that looks at its own state
[00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:48.840]   and responds to it, that's a kind of self-awareness,
[00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:55.200]   and more sophisticated versions could be like
[00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:57.360]   in information processing things,
[00:55:57.360 --> 00:56:00.520]   computers that look into their own internal state
[00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:03.960]   and do something about it, and I think
[00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:08.280]   that could also be done in neural nets.
[00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:10.280]   This is called recurrent neural nets,
[00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:12.880]   which are hard to understand and kind of a frontier.
[00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:18.280]   So I think understanding those and gradually building up
[00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:26.160]   a kind of profound ability to conceptualize
[00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:32.200]   different levels of self-awareness,
[00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:34.600]   what do you have to not know and what do you have to know,
[00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:36.720]   and when do you know that you don't know it,
[00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:39.560]   or what do you think you know that you don't really know?
[00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:45.720]   I think clarifying those issues,
[00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:48.760]   when we clarify those issues and get a rich theory
[00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:53.760]   around self-awareness, I think that will illuminate
[00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:58.200]   the questions about consciousness in a way that,
[00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:00.840]   scratching your chin and talking about qualia
[00:57:00.840 --> 00:57:04.280]   and blah, blah, blah, blah is never gonna do.
[00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:06.280]   - Well, I also have a different approach
[00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:09.080]   to the whole thing, so there's, from a robotics perspective,
[00:57:09.080 --> 00:57:12.840]   you can engineer things that exhibit
[00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:15.320]   qualities of consciousness without understanding
[00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:21.960]   how things work, and from that perspective,
[00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:26.400]   it's like a back door, like enter through
[00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:28.760]   the psychology door. - Precisely.
[00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:31.120]   - The cognitive science door. - I think we're on
[00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:32.360]   the same wavelength here.
[00:57:32.360 --> 00:57:35.960]   And let me just add one comment, which is,
[00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:41.840]   I think we should try to understand consciousness
[00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:46.840]   as we experience it, in evolutionary terms,
[00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:53.000]   and ask ourselves, why, why does it happen?
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:55.240]   - This thing seems useful, why is it useful?
[00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:57.120]   - Why is it useful? - Interesting question.
[00:57:57.120 --> 00:57:59.280]   (laughing)
[00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:01.560]   - We've got a conscious eye watch here.
[00:58:01.560 --> 00:58:03.480]   Interesting question, thank you, Siri.
[00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:04.320]   Okay.
[00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:08.120]   - Thank you, brother.
[00:58:08.120 --> 00:58:09.520]   - I'll get back to you later.
[00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:11.760]   (laughing)
[00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:18.120]   And I think, I'm morally certain that what's gonna emerge
[00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:23.480]   from analyzing recurrent neural nets and robotic design
[00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:29.160]   and advanced computer design is that having this kind of
[00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:34.720]   looking at the internal state in a structured way
[00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:40.560]   that doesn't look at everything, it's encapsulated,
[00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:42.240]   looks at highly processed information,
[00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:44.360]   is very selective and makes choices
[00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:45.760]   without knowing how they're made,
[00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:47.320]   so there'll also be an unconscious.
[00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:51.880]   I think that that is gonna turn out to be really essential
[00:58:51.880 --> 00:58:55.440]   to doing efficient information processing.
[00:58:55.440 --> 00:59:00.440]   And that's why it evolved, because it's helpful.
[00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:06.200]   Because brains come at a high cost.
[00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:09.440]   - So there has to be a good why.
[00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:13.000]   - And there's a reason, yeah, they're rare in evolution.
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:17.680]   And big brains are rare in evolution
[00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:19.880]   and they come at a big cost.
[00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:24.880]   I mean, they have high metabolic demands.
[00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:31.920]   They require very active lifestyle, warm-bloodedness,
[00:59:32.760 --> 00:59:37.760]   and take away from the ability to support metabolism
[00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:42.240]   of digestion, so it comes at a high cost.
[00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:44.280]   It has to pay back.
[00:59:44.280 --> 00:59:47.120]   - Yeah, I think it has a lot of value in social interaction.
[00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:49.560]   So I actually am spending the rest of the day today
[00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:54.560]   and with our friends that are, our legged friends
[00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:59.120]   in robotic form at Boston Dynamics.
[00:59:59.120 --> 01:00:03.760]   And I think, so my probably biggest passion
[01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:05.800]   is human-robot interaction.
[01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:09.480]   And it seems that consciousness from the perspective
[01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:12.920]   of the robot is very useful to improve
[01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:15.260]   the human-robot interaction experience.
[01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:18.540]   The first, the display of consciousness,
[01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:20.200]   but then to me there's a gray area
[01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:21.960]   between the display of consciousness
[01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:23.640]   and consciousness itself.
[01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:24.920]   If you think of consciousness
[01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:26.900]   from an evolutionary perspective,
[01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:29.880]   it seems like a useful tool in human communication.
[01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:32.040]   - Yes, it's certainly, well,
[01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:35.240]   whatever consciousness is will turn out to be.
[01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:39.700]   I think addressing it through its use
[01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:42.060]   and working up from simple cases
[01:00:42.060 --> 01:00:45.680]   and also working up from engineering experience
[01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:48.760]   in trying to do efficient computation,
[01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:53.380]   including efficient management of social interactions
[01:00:53.380 --> 01:00:56.260]   is going to really shed light on these questions.
[01:00:56.260 --> 01:00:59.680]   As I said, in a way that sort of musing abstractly
[01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:01.640]   about consciousness never would.
[01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:04.040]   - So as I mentioned, I talked to Sarah Walker
[01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:05.920]   and first of all, she says hi,
[01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:07.560]   spoke very highly of you.
[01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:12.420]   One of her concerns about physics and physicists and humans
[01:01:12.420 --> 01:01:16.960]   is that we may not fully understand the system
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:19.000]   that we're inside of.
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.880]   Meaning, like, there may be limits
[01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:24.440]   to the kind of physics we do
[01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:28.760]   in trying to understand the system of which we're part of.
[01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:33.760]   So like, the observer is also the observed.
[01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:36.720]   In that sense, it seems like
[01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:42.760]   our tools of understanding the world,
[01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:44.840]   I mean, this is mostly centered around the questions
[01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:47.520]   of what is life, trying to understand the patterns
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:51.300]   that are characteristic of life and intelligence,
[01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:52.600]   all those kinds of things.
[01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:57.360]   We're not using the right tools because we're in the system.
[01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:01.360]   Is there something that resonates with you there?
[01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:03.720]   Almost like-- - Well, yes.
[01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:08.560]   We do have, we have limitations, of course,
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:11.740]   in the amount of information we can process.
[01:02:11.740 --> 01:02:16.840]   On the other hand, we can get help from our silicon friends
[01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:21.460]   and we can get help from all kinds of instruments
[01:02:21.460 --> 01:02:24.200]   that make up for our perceptual deficits.
[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:30.040]   And we have to, and we can use, at a conceptual level,
[01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:32.760]   we can use different kinds of concepts
[01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:35.360]   to address different kinds of questions.
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:40.280]   So I'm not sure exactly what problem she's talking about.
[01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:44.000]   - It's the problem akin to an organism living
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.800]   in a 2D plane trying to understand a three-dimensional world.
[01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:48.920]   - Well, we can do that.
[01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:53.340]   I mean, we, in fact, for practical purposes,
[01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:55.780]   most of our experience is two-dimensional.
[01:02:55.780 --> 01:02:59.420]   It's hard to move vertically, and yet we've produced
[01:02:59.420 --> 01:03:01.780]   conceptually a three-dimensional symmetry,
[01:03:01.780 --> 01:03:04.420]   and in fact, four-dimensional space-time.
[01:03:04.420 --> 01:03:10.420]   So by thinking in appropriate ways and using instruments
[01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:14.820]   and getting consistent accounts and rich accounts,
[01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:18.740]   we find out what concepts are necessary.
[01:03:18.740 --> 01:03:25.920]   And I don't see any end in sight of the process
[01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:28.880]   or any showstoppers because,
[01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:32.160]   let me give you an example.
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:35.400]   I mean, for instance, QCD,
[01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:37.320]   our theory of the strong interaction,
[01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:40.280]   has nice equations, which I helped to discover.
[01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:41.240]   - What's QCD?
[01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:42.840]   - Quantum chromodynamics.
[01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:47.460]   So it's our theory of the strong interaction,
[01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:51.380]   the interaction that is responsible for nuclear physics.
[01:03:51.380 --> 01:03:53.700]   So it's the interaction that governs how quarks
[01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:55.300]   and gluons interact with each other
[01:03:55.300 --> 01:04:00.300]   and make protons and neutrons and all the strong,
[01:04:00.300 --> 01:04:05.340]   the related particles and many things in physics.
[01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:07.900]   That's one of the four basic forces of nature
[01:04:07.900 --> 01:04:09.780]   as we presently understand it.
[01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:15.740]   And so we have beautiful equations,
[01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:20.740]   which we can test in very special circumstances,
[01:04:20.740 --> 01:04:25.660]   using at high energies, at accelerators.
[01:04:25.660 --> 01:04:28.660]   So we're certain that these equations are correct.
[01:04:28.660 --> 01:04:30.460]   Prizes are given for it, and so,
[01:04:30.460 --> 01:04:32.760]   and people try to knock it down and they can't.
[01:04:38.660 --> 01:04:42.960]   But the situations in which we can calculate
[01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:46.200]   the consequences of these equations are very limited.
[01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:51.200]   So for instance, no one has been able to demonstrate
[01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:57.000]   that this theory, which is built on quarks and gluons,
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:01.000]   which no one, which you don't observe,
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.280]   actually produces protons and neutrons
[01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:04.480]   and the things you do observe.
[01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:06.540]   This is called the problem of confinement.
[01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:10.960]   So no one's been able to prove that analytically
[01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:13.500]   in a way that a human can understand.
[01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:16.620]   On the other hand, we can take these equations
[01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:20.380]   to a computer, to gigantic computers and compute,
[01:05:20.380 --> 01:05:25.380]   and by God, you get the world from it.
[01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:30.420]   So these equations, in a way that we don't understand
[01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:36.720]   in terms of human concepts, we can't do the calculations,
[01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:38.980]   but our machines can do them.
[01:05:38.980 --> 01:05:43.440]   So with the help of what I like to call our silicon friends
[01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:46.560]   and their descendants in the future,
[01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:50.680]   we can understand in a different way
[01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:52.980]   that allows us to understand more.
[01:05:52.980 --> 01:05:55.020]   But I don't think we'll ever,
[01:05:55.020 --> 01:05:56.820]   no human is ever going to be able
[01:05:56.820 --> 01:06:00.220]   to solve those equations in the same way.
[01:06:00.220 --> 01:06:04.740]   But I think that's, you know,
[01:06:04.740 --> 01:06:09.540]   when we find limitations to our natural abilities,
[01:06:09.540 --> 01:06:12.860]   we can try to find workarounds,
[01:06:12.860 --> 01:06:15.140]   and sometimes that's appropriate concepts,
[01:06:15.140 --> 01:06:17.300]   sometimes it's appropriate instruments,
[01:06:17.300 --> 01:06:19.740]   sometimes it's a combination of the two,
[01:06:19.740 --> 01:06:24.740]   but I think it's premature to get defeatist about it.
[01:06:24.740 --> 01:06:31.180]   I don't see any logical contradiction
[01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:35.060]   or paradox or limitation
[01:06:35.060 --> 01:06:38.300]   that will bring this process to a halt.
[01:06:38.300 --> 01:06:40.980]   - Well, I think the idea is to continue thinking
[01:06:40.980 --> 01:06:42.900]   outside the box in different directions,
[01:06:42.900 --> 01:06:45.860]   meaning just like how the math allows us
[01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:47.280]   to think in multiple dimensions
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:49.060]   outside of our perception system,
[01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:54.580]   sort of thinking, you know,
[01:06:54.580 --> 01:06:57.100]   coming up with new tools of mathematics or computation
[01:06:57.100 --> 01:06:58.460]   or all those kinds of things
[01:07:00.980 --> 01:07:04.220]   to take different perspectives on our universe.
[01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:05.740]   - Well, I'm all for that, you know,
[01:07:05.740 --> 01:07:08.820]   and I kind of have even elevated it into a principle,
[01:07:08.820 --> 01:07:11.540]   which is of complementarity, following Bohr,
[01:07:11.540 --> 01:07:16.540]   that you need different ways of thinking,
[01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:18.660]   even about the same things,
[01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:21.120]   in order to do justice to their reality
[01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:23.940]   and answer different kinds of questions about them.
[01:07:23.940 --> 01:07:27.540]   I mean, we've several times alluded to the fact
[01:07:27.540 --> 01:07:30.300]   that human beings are hard to understand
[01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:34.580]   and the concepts that you use to understand human beings,
[01:07:34.580 --> 01:07:37.660]   if you wanna prescribe drugs for them
[01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:42.580]   or see what's gonna happen if they move very fast
[01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:45.180]   or are exposed to radiation,
[01:07:45.180 --> 01:07:47.180]   and so that requires one kind of thinking
[01:07:47.180 --> 01:07:48.700]   that's very physical,
[01:07:48.700 --> 01:07:55.420]   based on the fact that the materials that we're made out of.
[01:07:55.420 --> 01:07:57.620]   On the other hand, if you want to understand
[01:07:57.620 --> 01:07:59.380]   how a person's going to behave
[01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:01.220]   in a different kind of situation,
[01:08:01.220 --> 01:08:06.100]   you need entirely different concepts from psychology,
[01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:08.460]   and there's nothing wrong with that.
[01:08:08.460 --> 01:08:09.740]   You can have very different ways
[01:08:09.740 --> 01:08:11.800]   of addressing the same material
[01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:14.900]   that are useful for different purposes, right?
[01:08:14.900 --> 01:08:16.100]   - Can you describe this idea,
[01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:18.900]   which is fascinating, of complementarity a little bit?
[01:08:18.900 --> 01:08:23.900]   Sort of, first of all, what state is the principle?
[01:08:23.900 --> 01:08:26.780]   What is it?
[01:08:26.780 --> 01:08:29.140]   And second of all, what are good examples?
[01:08:29.140 --> 01:08:30.900]   Starting from quantum mechanics,
[01:08:30.900 --> 01:08:32.660]   you still mentioned psychology.
[01:08:32.660 --> 01:08:33.500]   Let's talk about this more.
[01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:34.860]   It's like, in your new book,
[01:08:34.860 --> 01:08:37.060]   one of the most fascinating ideas, actually.
[01:08:37.060 --> 01:08:40.220]   - I think it's a wonderful, yeah.
[01:08:40.220 --> 01:08:43.140]   To me, it's, well, it's the culminating chapter of the book,
[01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:48.140]   and I think, since the whole book is about the big lessons
[01:08:48.140 --> 01:08:52.500]   or big takeaways from profound understanding
[01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:55.500]   of the physical world that we've achieved,
[01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:59.080]   including that it's mysterious in some ways,
[01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:03.580]   the, this was the final,
[01:09:03.580 --> 01:09:08.220]   overarching lesson, complementarity.
[01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:13.220]   And it's a approach.
[01:09:13.220 --> 01:09:18.460]   So, unlike some of these other things,
[01:09:18.460 --> 01:09:20.580]   which are just facts about the world,
[01:09:20.580 --> 01:09:22.420]   like the world is both big and small
[01:09:22.420 --> 01:09:26.260]   in different sense, and is big, but we're not small,
[01:09:26.260 --> 01:09:28.420]   the things we talked about earlier,
[01:09:28.420 --> 01:09:30.760]   and the fact that the universe is comprehensible,
[01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:33.560]   and how complexity could emerge from simplicity,
[01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:37.840]   and those things are, in the broad sense,
[01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:39.720]   facts about the world,
[01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:42.920]   complementarity is more an attitude towards the world,
[01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:46.280]   and encouraged by the facts about the world.
[01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:51.280]   And it's the idea, the concept, or the approach,
[01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:58.640]   that, or the realization, that it can be appropriate,
[01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:02.840]   and useful, and inevitable, and unavoidable
[01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:07.840]   to use very different descriptions of the same object,
[01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:11.740]   or the same system, or the same situation,
[01:10:11.740 --> 01:10:15.500]   to answer different kinds of questions
[01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:17.920]   that may be very different,
[01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:22.920]   and even mutually uninterpretable,
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:26.920]   and mutually incomprehensible.
[01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:28.960]   - But both correct somehow.
[01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:30.960]   - But both correct, and sources
[01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:32.720]   of different kinds of insight.
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:34.040]   - Which is so weird.
[01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:34.880]   - Yeah, well--
[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:36.600]   - But it seems to work in so many cases.
[01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:41.080]   - It works in many cases, and I think it's a deep fact
[01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:44.600]   about the world, and how we should approach it.
[01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:49.600]   It's most rigorous form, where it's actually a theorem,
[01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:53.480]   if quantum mechanics is correct,
[01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:55.320]   occurs in quantum mechanics,
[01:10:55.320 --> 01:11:00.320]   where the primary description of the world
[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:03.360]   is in terms of wave functions.
[01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:04.640]   But let's not talk about the world,
[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:07.440]   let's just talk about a particle, an electron.
[01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:12.560]   The primary description of that electron
[01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:14.400]   is its wave function.
[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:18.680]   And the wave function can be used to predict
[01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:23.040]   where it's gonna be, if you observe,
[01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:25.680]   it'll be in different places with different probabilities,
[01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:27.480]   or how fast it's moving,
[01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:31.240]   and it'll also be moving in different ways
[01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:32.720]   with different probabilities,
[01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:35.200]   that's what quantum mechanics says.
[01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:39.360]   And you can predict either set of probabilities,
[01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:42.940]   what's gonna happen if I make an observation
[01:11:42.940 --> 01:11:46.080]   of the position or the velocity.
[01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:50.240]   But, so the wave function gives you ways
[01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:53.200]   of doing both of those, but to do it,
[01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:55.280]   to get those predictions, you have to process
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:57.280]   the wave function in different ways.
[01:11:57.280 --> 01:11:59.080]   You process it one way for position,
[01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:01.480]   and in a different way for momentum,
[01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:05.360]   and those ways are mathematically incompatible.
[01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:08.440]   It's like, you know, it's like you have a stone
[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:11.120]   and you can sculpt it into a Venus de Milo,
[01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:14.320]   or you can sculpt it into David, but you can't do both.
[01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:20.440]   And that's an example of complementarity,
[01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:22.540]   to answer different kinds of questions,
[01:12:22.540 --> 01:12:25.880]   you have to analyze the system in different ways
[01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:29.160]   that are mutually incompatible,
[01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:32.760]   but both valid to answer different kinds of questions.
[01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:34.840]   So in that case, it's a theorem,
[01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:38.880]   but I think it's a much more widespread phenomena
[01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:40.400]   that applies to many cases
[01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:42.360]   where we can't prove it as a theorem,
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:46.480]   but it's a piece of wisdom, if you like,
[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:51.480]   and appears to be a very important insight.
[01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:52.960]   - Do you--
[01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:57.040]   - And if you ignore it, you can get very confused
[01:12:57.040 --> 01:13:01.600]   and misguided.
[01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:07.000]   - Do you think this is a useful hack
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:10.560]   for ideas that we don't fully understand,
[01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:13.720]   or is this somehow a fundamental property
[01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:18.720]   of all or many ideas that you can take multiple perspectives
[01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:20.800]   and they're both true?
[01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:22.160]   - Well, I think it's both.
[01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:26.040]   - So it's both the answer to all questions.
[01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:27.400]   - Yes, that's right.
[01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:28.920]   It's not either or, it's both.
[01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:32.760]   - It's paralyzing to think that we live in a world
[01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:37.400]   that's fundamentally surrounded by complementary ideas.
[01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:41.880]   Because we want universe,
[01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:45.720]   we somehow want to attach ourselves to absolute truths,
[01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:48.000]   and absolute truths certainly don't like
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.080]   the idea of complementarity.
[01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:53.120]   - Yes, Einstein was very uncomfortable with complementarity.
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:57.400]   And in a broad sense, the famous Bohr-Einstein debates
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:00.720]   revolved around this question
[01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:03.000]   of whether the complementarity
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:08.000]   that is a foundational feature of quantum mechanics
[01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:13.280]   as we have it is a permanent feature of the universe
[01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:19.000]   and our description of nature.
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:22.880]   And so far, quantum mechanics wins.
[01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:23.720]   (laughing)
[01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:26.440]   And it's gone from triumph to triumph.
[01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:28.680]   Whether complementarity is rock bottom,
[01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:31.560]   I guess you can never be sure.
[01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:34.200]   I mean, but it looks awfully good
[01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:35.520]   and it's been very successful.
[01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:40.360]   And certainly, complementarity has been extremely useful
[01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:43.440]   and fruitful in that domain,
[01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:49.340]   including some of Einstein's attempts to challenge it,
[01:14:49.340 --> 01:14:55.400]   like the famous Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen experiment
[01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:57.320]   turned out to be confirmations
[01:14:57.320 --> 01:15:03.240]   that have been useful in themselves.
[01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:05.120]   But so thinking about these things was fruitful,
[01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:07.880]   but not in the way that Einstein hoped.
[01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:15.440]   Yeah, so as I said,
[01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:19.560]   in the case of quantum mechanics
[01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:22.000]   and this dilemma or dichotomy
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:29.200]   between processing the wave function in different ways,
[01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:30.040]   it's a theorem.
[01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:31.120]   They're mutually incompatible
[01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:32.840]   and that the physical correlate of that
[01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:35.040]   is the Heisenberg uncertainty principle
[01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:37.600]   that you can't have position and momentum
[01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:38.840]   determined at once.
[01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:43.960]   But in other cases,
[01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:48.080]   like one that I like to think about
[01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:50.080]   or like to point out as an example
[01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:52.960]   is free will and determinism.
[01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:57.160]   It's much less of a theorem
[01:15:57.160 --> 01:16:01.680]   and more a kind of
[01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:06.200]   way of thinking about things
[01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:10.600]   that I think is reassuring
[01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:15.600]   and avoids a lot of unnecessary quarreling and confusion.
[01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:17.440]   - The quarreling I'm okay with
[01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:18.920]   and the confusion I'm okay with,
[01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:21.600]   I mean, people debate about difficult ideas,
[01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:24.520]   but the question is whether it could be
[01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:26.840]   almost a fundamental truth.
[01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:28.280]   - I think it is a fundamental truth.
[01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:30.520]   - Free will is both an illusion
[01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:32.600]   and not.
[01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:34.200]   - Yes, I think that's correct.
[01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:37.400]   - And there's a reason why people say
[01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:39.240]   quantum mechanics is weird
[01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:42.780]   and complementarity is a big part of that.
[01:16:42.780 --> 01:16:48.720]   To say that our actual whole world is weird,
[01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:52.080]   the whole hierarchy of the universe is weird
[01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:54.400]   in this kind of particular way,
[01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:58.440]   and it's quite profound,
[01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:01.440]   but it's also humbling
[01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:06.720]   because it's like we're never going to be on sturdy ground
[01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:09.300]   in the way that humans like to be.
[01:17:09.300 --> 01:17:11.000]   It's like you have to embrace that
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:17.840]   this whole thing is a unsteady mess.
[01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:21.080]   - It's one of many lessons in humility
[01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:27.040]   that we run into in profound understanding of the world.
[01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:30.680]   I mean, the Copernican revolution was one,
[01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:35.160]   that the Earth is not the center of the universe.
[01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:36.920]   Darwinian evolution is another,
[01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:39.640]   that humans are not the pinnacle
[01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:45.240]   of God's creation.
[01:17:45.240 --> 01:17:53.280]   And the apparent result of deep understanding
[01:17:56.480 --> 01:18:00.360]   of physical reality, that mind emerges from matter,
[01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:05.360]   and there's no call on special life forces or souls.
[01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:11.400]   These are all lessons in humility,
[01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:16.400]   and I actually find complementarity a liberating concept.
[01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:21.520]   It's, okay, you know--
[01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:22.680]   - Yeah, it is in a way.
[01:18:22.680 --> 01:18:24.920]   (laughing)
[01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:30.880]   There's a story about Dr. Johnson,
[01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:32.640]   and he's talking with Boswell,
[01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:36.440]   and Boswell was, they were discussing a sermon
[01:18:36.440 --> 01:18:37.840]   that they'd both heard,
[01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:41.160]   and the sort of culmination of the sermon
[01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:45.400]   was the speaker saying, "I accept the universe."
[01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:49.280]   And Dr. Johnson said, "Well, he'd damn well better."
[01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:51.400]   (laughing)
[01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:55.720]   And there's a certain joy in accepting the universe,
[01:18:55.720 --> 01:18:57.320]   because it's mind-expanding.
[01:18:57.320 --> 01:19:07.480]   And to me, complementarity also suggests tolerance,
[01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:15.160]   suggests opportunities for understanding things
[01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:20.760]   in different ways, that add to,
[01:19:20.760 --> 01:19:25.080]   rather than detract from understanding.
[01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:30.080]   So I think it's an opportunity for mind expansion,
[01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:33.200]   and demanding that there's only one way
[01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:36.760]   to think about things can be very limiting.
[01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:38.960]   - On the free will one, that's a trippy one, though.
[01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:39.800]   (laughing)
[01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:43.560]   To think like I am the decider of my own actions,
[01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:45.360]   and at the same time, I'm not,
[01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:49.800]   is tricky to think about,
[01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:53.480]   but there does seem to be some kind of profound truth
[01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:54.320]   in that.
[01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:56.880]   - I get, well, I think it is tied up,
[01:19:56.880 --> 01:19:58.400]   it will turn out to be tied up
[01:19:58.400 --> 01:20:00.320]   when we understand things better
[01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:02.760]   with these issues of self-awareness,
[01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:06.980]   and where we get, what we perceive as making choices,
[01:20:06.980 --> 01:20:08.080]   what does that really mean,
[01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:10.280]   and what's going on under the hood,
[01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:15.040]   but I'm speculating about a future understanding
[01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:17.000]   that's not in place at present.
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:18.800]   - Your sense there will always be,
[01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:22.880]   like as you dig into the self-awareness thing,
[01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:24.600]   there'll always be some places
[01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:26.640]   where complementarity is gonna show up.
[01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:28.040]   - Oh, definitely, yeah.
[01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:31.560]   I mean, there will be, how should I say,
[01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:33.720]   there'll be kind of a God's eye view,
[01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:37.400]   which sees everything that's going on
[01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:40.120]   in the computer or the brain,
[01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:42.280]   and then there's the brain's own view,
[01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:46.240]   or the central processor, or whatever it is,
[01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:50.760]   what we call the self, the consciousness,
[01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:53.480]   that's only aware of a very small part of it,
[01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:54.920]   and those are very different.
[01:20:54.920 --> 01:20:59.680]   So the God's eye view can be deterministic
[01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:04.680]   while the self view sees free will.
[01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:11.360]   I'm pretty sure that's how it's gonna work out, actually.
[01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:15.140]   But as it stands, free will is a concept
[01:21:15.140 --> 01:21:19.240]   that we definitely, at least I feel I definitely experience.
[01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:21.560]   I can choose to do one thing than another,
[01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:24.880]   and other people, I think, are sufficiently similar to me
[01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:28.380]   that I trust that they feel the same way.
[01:21:28.380 --> 01:21:33.560]   And it's an essential concept in psychology,
[01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:35.680]   and law, and so forth.
[01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:40.680]   But at the same time, I think that mind emerges from matter,
[01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:47.320]   and that there's an alternative description of matter
[01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:51.120]   that's up to subtleties about quantum mechanics,
[01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:53.920]   which I don't think are relevant here,
[01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:56.140]   really is deterministic.
[01:21:56.140 --> 01:21:57.940]   - Let me ask you about some particles.
[01:21:57.940 --> 01:21:59.160]   - Okay.
[01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:00.840]   - First, the absurd question,
[01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:04.940]   almost like a question that Plato would ask.
[01:22:04.940 --> 01:22:07.700]   What is the smallest thing in the universe?
[01:22:08.820 --> 01:22:13.500]   - As far as we know, the fundamental particles
[01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:17.460]   out of which we build our most successful description
[01:22:17.460 --> 01:22:20.020]   of nature are points.
[01:22:20.020 --> 01:22:24.880]   They have zero, they don't have any internal structure.
[01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:29.600]   So that's as small as can be.
[01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:33.980]   So what does that mean operationally?
[01:22:33.980 --> 01:22:37.980]   That means that they obey equations
[01:22:37.980 --> 01:22:42.980]   that describe entities that are singular concentrations
[01:22:42.980 --> 01:22:47.740]   of energy, momentum, angular momentum,
[01:22:47.740 --> 01:22:50.140]   the things that particles have,
[01:22:50.140 --> 01:22:53.460]   but localized at individual points.
[01:22:53.460 --> 01:22:57.940]   Now, that mathematical structure
[01:22:57.940 --> 01:23:01.420]   is only revealed partially in the world
[01:23:01.420 --> 01:23:04.620]   because to process the wave function
[01:23:04.620 --> 01:23:08.460]   in a way that accesses information
[01:23:08.460 --> 01:23:10.280]   about the precise position of things,
[01:23:10.280 --> 01:23:12.060]   you have to apply a lot of energy,
[01:23:12.060 --> 01:23:15.620]   and that's an idealization that you can apply
[01:23:15.620 --> 01:23:19.860]   infinite amount of energy to determine a precise position.
[01:23:19.860 --> 01:23:22.420]   But at the mathematical level,
[01:23:22.420 --> 01:23:26.580]   we build the world out of particles that are points.
[01:23:26.580 --> 01:23:29.260]   - So do they actually exist, and what are we talking about?
[01:23:29.260 --> 01:23:30.100]   - Oh, they exist.
[01:23:30.100 --> 01:23:33.000]   - So let me ask, do quarks exist?
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:34.980]   - Yes. (laughs)
[01:23:34.980 --> 01:23:36.220]   Do electrons exist?
[01:23:36.220 --> 01:23:37.060]   Yes.
[01:23:37.060 --> 01:23:37.900]   Do photons exist?
[01:23:37.900 --> 01:23:38.720]   Yes.
[01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:39.700]   - But what does it mean for them to exist?
[01:23:39.700 --> 01:23:43.520]   - Okay, so well, the hard answer to that,
[01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:48.520]   the precise answer is that we construct the world
[01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:51.860]   out of equations that contain entities
[01:23:51.860 --> 01:23:56.740]   that are reproducible,
[01:23:56.740 --> 01:24:00.880]   that exist in vast numbers throughout the universe,
[01:24:01.940 --> 01:24:06.740]   that have definite properties of mass, spin,
[01:24:06.740 --> 01:24:13.380]   and a few others that we call electrons.
[01:24:13.380 --> 01:24:17.220]   And what an electron is is defined by the equations
[01:24:17.220 --> 01:24:19.900]   that it satisfies, theoretically,
[01:24:19.900 --> 01:24:24.180]   and we find that there are many, many exemplars
[01:24:24.180 --> 01:24:28.860]   of that entity in the physical world.
[01:24:28.860 --> 01:24:33.620]   So in the case of electrons, we can isolate them
[01:24:33.620 --> 01:24:36.740]   and study them in individual ones in great detail,
[01:24:36.740 --> 01:24:41.180]   and we can check that they all actually are identical,
[01:24:41.180 --> 01:24:44.820]   and that's why chemistry works.
[01:24:44.820 --> 01:24:49.820]   And yes, so in that case, it's very tangible.
[01:24:49.820 --> 01:24:53.580]   Similarly with photons, you can study them individually,
[01:24:53.580 --> 01:24:55.280]   they're the units of light.
[01:24:56.520 --> 01:24:59.900]   And nowadays, it's very practical
[01:24:59.900 --> 01:25:04.140]   to study individual photons and determine their spin
[01:25:04.140 --> 01:25:05.740]   and their other basic properties
[01:25:05.740 --> 01:25:11.100]   and check out the equations in great detail.
[01:25:11.100 --> 01:25:15.300]   For quarks and gluons, which are the other two
[01:25:15.300 --> 01:25:20.300]   main ingredients of our model of matter
[01:25:20.300 --> 01:25:23.580]   that's so successful, it's a little more complicated
[01:25:23.580 --> 01:25:28.320]   because the quarks and gluons that appear in our equations
[01:25:28.320 --> 01:25:33.360]   don't appear directly as particles you can isolate
[01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:35.720]   and study individually.
[01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:40.720]   They always occur within what are called bound states
[01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:43.960]   or structures like protons.
[01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:48.040]   A proton, roughly speaking, is composed of three quarks
[01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:50.600]   and a lot of gluons, but we can detect them
[01:25:50.600 --> 01:25:54.400]   in a remarkably direct way actually nowadays,
[01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:57.300]   whereas at relatively low energies,
[01:25:57.300 --> 01:26:00.820]   the behavior of quarks is complicated,
[01:26:00.820 --> 01:26:05.500]   at high energies, they can propagate through space
[01:26:05.500 --> 01:26:10.500]   relatively freely for a while, and we can see their tracks.
[01:26:10.500 --> 01:26:14.820]   So ultimately, they get recaptured into protons
[01:26:14.820 --> 01:26:17.940]   and other mesons and funny things,
[01:26:17.940 --> 01:26:21.020]   but for a short time, they propagate freely,
[01:26:21.020 --> 01:26:25.220]   and while that happens, we can take snapshots
[01:26:25.220 --> 01:26:27.400]   and see their manifestations.
[01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:31.660]   This is actually, this kind of thing is exactly
[01:26:31.660 --> 01:26:34.060]   what I got the Nobel Prize for, predicting that this
[01:26:34.060 --> 01:26:36.460]   would work, and similarly for gluons,
[01:26:36.460 --> 01:26:41.460]   although you can't isolate them as individual particles
[01:26:41.460 --> 01:26:43.860]   and study them in the same way we study electrons,
[01:26:43.860 --> 01:26:48.860]   say, you can use them theoretically as entities
[01:26:48.860 --> 01:26:56.780]   out of which you build tangible things
[01:26:56.780 --> 01:27:02.020]   that we actually do observe, but also you can,
[01:27:02.020 --> 01:27:04.880]   at accelerators, at high energy, you can liberate them
[01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:07.400]   for brief periods of time and study how they,
[01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:13.540]   and get convincing evidence that they leave tracks
[01:27:13.540 --> 01:27:16.820]   and you can get convincing evidence that they were there
[01:27:16.820 --> 01:27:19.540]   and have the properties that we wanted them to have.
[01:27:19.540 --> 01:27:21.220]   - Can we talk about asymptotic freedom,
[01:27:21.220 --> 01:27:23.940]   this very idea that you won the Nobel Prize for?
[01:27:23.940 --> 01:27:25.260]   - Yeah.
[01:27:25.260 --> 01:27:29.620]   - So it describes a very weird effect to me,
[01:27:29.620 --> 01:27:33.180]   the weird in the following way.
[01:27:33.180 --> 01:27:38.180]   So the way I think of most forces or interactions,
[01:27:39.780 --> 01:27:43.820]   the closer you are, the stronger the effect,
[01:27:43.820 --> 01:27:46.300]   the stronger the force, right?
[01:27:46.300 --> 01:27:51.300]   With quarks, the closer they are, the less,
[01:27:51.300 --> 01:27:55.380]   so the strong interaction, and in fact,
[01:27:55.380 --> 01:27:58.620]   they basically act like free particles
[01:27:58.620 --> 01:28:00.660]   when they're very close.
[01:28:00.660 --> 01:28:01.900]   - That's right, yes.
[01:28:01.900 --> 01:28:04.560]   - But this requires a huge amount of energy.
[01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:06.200]   Like, can you describe me,
[01:28:08.300 --> 01:28:10.820]   why, how does this even work?
[01:28:10.820 --> 01:28:11.660]   (Dave laughs)
[01:28:11.660 --> 01:28:12.500]   You know how weird it is?
[01:28:12.500 --> 01:28:17.500]   - A proper description must bring in quantum mechanics
[01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:20.640]   and relativity and it's,
[01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:25.460]   so a proper description, and equations,
[01:28:25.460 --> 01:28:28.660]   so a proper description really is probably
[01:28:28.660 --> 01:28:33.580]   more than we have time for and require quite a bit
[01:28:33.580 --> 01:28:34.900]   of patience on your part.
[01:28:34.900 --> 01:28:37.660]   - How does relativity come into play?
[01:28:37.660 --> 01:28:38.500]   Wait, wait a minute.
[01:28:38.500 --> 01:28:43.020]   - Oh, relativity is important because when we talk about,
[01:28:43.020 --> 01:28:51.540]   trying to think about short distances,
[01:28:51.540 --> 01:28:55.020]   we have to think about very large momenta
[01:28:55.020 --> 01:28:56.540]   and very large momenta are connected
[01:28:56.540 --> 01:28:59.140]   to very large energy in relativity,
[01:28:59.140 --> 01:29:02.440]   and so the connection between how things behave
[01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:06.140]   at short distances and how things behave at high energy
[01:29:06.140 --> 01:29:09.340]   really is connected through relativity
[01:29:09.340 --> 01:29:12.980]   in sort of a slightly backhanded way.
[01:29:12.980 --> 01:29:16.180]   Quantum mechanics indicates that short,
[01:29:16.180 --> 01:29:19.000]   to get, to analyze short distances,
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:25.120]   you need to bring in probes that carry a lot of momentum.
[01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:29.140]   This again is related to uncertainty
[01:29:29.140 --> 01:29:31.980]   because it's the fact that you have to bring in
[01:29:31.980 --> 01:29:36.060]   a lot of momentum that interferes with the possibility
[01:29:36.060 --> 01:29:40.220]   of determining position and momentum at the same time.
[01:29:40.220 --> 01:29:42.000]   If you want to determine position,
[01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:45.180]   you have to use instruments that bring in a lot of momentum,
[01:29:45.180 --> 01:29:48.580]   and because of that, those same instruments
[01:29:48.580 --> 01:29:50.060]   can't also measure momentum
[01:29:50.060 --> 01:29:51.960]   'cause they're disturbing the momentum,
[01:29:51.960 --> 01:29:56.220]   and then the momentum brings in energy, and yeah.
[01:29:56.220 --> 01:29:59.540]   So that, there's also the effect that asymptotic freedom
[01:29:59.540 --> 01:30:04.540]   comes from the possibility of spontaneously making
[01:30:05.540 --> 01:30:10.540]   quarks and gluons for short amounts of time
[01:30:10.540 --> 01:30:15.460]   that fluctuate into existence and out of existence,
[01:30:15.460 --> 01:30:21.580]   and the fact that that can be done
[01:30:21.580 --> 01:30:23.780]   with a very little amount of energy
[01:30:23.780 --> 01:30:26.100]   and uncertainty in energy
[01:30:26.100 --> 01:30:27.580]   translates into uncertainty in time.
[01:30:27.580 --> 01:30:31.440]   So if you do that for a short time, you can do that.
[01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:34.000]   Well, it all comes in a package.
[01:30:34.840 --> 01:30:39.480]   So I told you it would take a while to really explain,
[01:30:39.480 --> 01:30:44.080]   but the results can be understood.
[01:30:44.080 --> 01:30:48.120]   I mean, we can state the results pretty simply, I think.
[01:30:48.120 --> 01:30:53.120]   So in everyday life, we do encounter some forces
[01:30:53.120 --> 01:30:56.400]   that increase with distance
[01:30:56.400 --> 01:30:59.320]   and kind of turn off at short distances.
[01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:02.120]   That's the way rubber bands work, if you think about it,
[01:31:02.120 --> 01:31:07.000]   or if you pull them hard, they resist,
[01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:11.640]   but they get flabby if the rubber band is not pulled.
[01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:17.640]   And so there are, that can happen in the physical world,
[01:31:17.640 --> 01:31:19.860]   but what's really difficult is to see
[01:31:19.860 --> 01:31:21.800]   how that could be a fundamental force
[01:31:21.800 --> 01:31:24.400]   that's consistent with everything else we know,
[01:31:24.400 --> 01:31:28.480]   and that's what asymptotic freedom is.
[01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:33.480]   It says that there's a very particular kind
[01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:37.440]   of fundamental force that involves special particles
[01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:40.320]   called gluons with very special properties
[01:31:40.320 --> 01:31:43.040]   that enables that kind of behavior.
[01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:47.340]   So there were experiment, at the time we did our work,
[01:31:47.340 --> 01:31:49.240]   there were experimental indications
[01:31:49.240 --> 01:31:54.160]   that quarks and gluons did have this kind of property,
[01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:57.680]   but there were no equations that were capable
[01:31:57.680 --> 01:32:01.320]   of capturing it, and we found the equations
[01:32:01.320 --> 01:32:03.880]   and showed how they work and showed how they,
[01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:06.240]   that they were basically unique,
[01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:08.320]   and this led to a complete theory
[01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:10.000]   of how the strong interaction works,
[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:14.220]   which is the quantum chromodynamics we mentioned earlier.
[01:32:14.220 --> 01:32:23.160]   So that's the phenomenon, that quarks and gluons
[01:32:23.160 --> 01:32:26.500]   interact very, very weakly when they're close together.
[01:32:26.500 --> 01:32:29.080]   That's connected through relativity
[01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:32.480]   with the fact that they also interact very, very weakly
[01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:33.980]   at high energies.
[01:32:33.980 --> 01:32:36.640]   So if you have, so at high energies,
[01:32:36.640 --> 01:32:42.200]   the simplicity of the fundamental interaction gets revealed.
[01:32:42.200 --> 01:32:45.700]   At the time we did our work, the clues were very subtle,
[01:32:45.700 --> 01:32:50.100]   but nowadays, at what are now high-energy accelerators,
[01:32:50.100 --> 01:32:52.840]   it's all obvious, so we would have had a much,
[01:32:52.840 --> 01:32:55.500]   well, somebody would have had a much easier time
[01:32:55.500 --> 01:32:57.680]   20 years later looking at the data.
[01:32:57.680 --> 01:32:59.920]   You can sort of see the quarks and gluons.
[01:32:59.920 --> 01:33:02.120]   As I mentioned, they leave these short tracks
[01:33:02.120 --> 01:33:04.320]   that would have been much, much easier,
[01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:09.320]   but from indirect clues, we were able to piece together
[01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:13.200]   enough to make that behavior a prediction
[01:33:13.200 --> 01:33:15.880]   rather than a postdiction, right?
[01:33:15.880 --> 01:33:17.920]   - So it becomes obvious at high energies.
[01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:19.200]   - It becomes very obvious.
[01:33:19.200 --> 01:33:23.560]   When we first did this work, it was frontiers
[01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:27.740]   of high-energy physics, and at big international conferences,
[01:33:27.740 --> 01:33:30.840]   there would always be sessions on testing QCD
[01:33:30.840 --> 01:33:34.360]   and whether this proposed description
[01:33:34.360 --> 01:33:36.420]   of the strong interaction was, in fact, correct
[01:33:36.420 --> 01:33:39.720]   and so forth, and it was very exciting.
[01:33:39.720 --> 01:33:44.720]   But nowadays, the same kind of work,
[01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:48.880]   but much more precise with calculations
[01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:50.660]   to more accuracy and experiments
[01:33:50.660 --> 01:33:55.320]   that are much more precise and comparisons
[01:33:55.320 --> 01:33:57.140]   that are very precise.
[01:33:57.140 --> 01:33:59.080]   Now it's called calculating backgrounds
[01:33:59.080 --> 01:34:03.000]   because people take this for granted
[01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:06.640]   and wanna see deviations from the theory,
[01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:09.720]   which would be the new discoveries.
[01:34:09.720 --> 01:34:11.680]   - Yeah, the cutting edge becomes the foundation,
[01:34:11.680 --> 01:34:13.560]   the foundation becomes boring, yes.
[01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:19.120]   Is there some, for basic explanation purposes,
[01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:23.320]   is there something to be said about strong interactions
[01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:26.240]   in the context of the strong nuclear force
[01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:30.800]   for the attraction between protons and neutrons
[01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:35.360]   versus the interaction between quarks within protons?
[01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:40.360]   - Well, quarks and gluons have the same relation
[01:34:40.360 --> 01:34:45.600]   basically to nuclear physics as electrons
[01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:49.720]   and photons have to atomic and molecular physics.
[01:34:49.720 --> 01:34:54.720]   So atoms and photons are the dynamic entities
[01:34:54.720 --> 01:35:01.540]   that really come into play in chemistry and atomic physics.
[01:35:01.540 --> 01:35:03.180]   Of course, you have to have the atomic nuclei,
[01:35:03.180 --> 01:35:07.040]   but those are small and relatively inert,
[01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:09.400]   really the dynamical part.
[01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:12.060]   And for most purposes of chemistry,
[01:35:12.060 --> 01:35:14.160]   you just say you have this tiny little nucleus,
[01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:19.160]   which QCD gives you, don't worry about it, it's there.
[01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:22.640]   The real action is the electrons moving around
[01:35:22.640 --> 01:35:24.440]   and exchanging and things like that.
[01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:29.300]   But okay, but we wanted to understand the nucleus too.
[01:35:29.300 --> 01:35:34.300]   And so atoms are sort of quantum mechanical clouds
[01:35:34.300 --> 01:35:38.840]   of electrons held together by electrical forces,
[01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:40.780]   which is photons, and then there's radiation,
[01:35:40.780 --> 01:35:43.280]   which is another aspect of photons.
[01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:44.520]   - That's where all the fun happens
[01:35:44.520 --> 01:35:46.480]   is the electrons and the photons and all that kind of stuff.
[01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:49.120]   - That's right, and the nucleus are kind of the,
[01:35:49.120 --> 01:35:53.880]   well, they give the positive charge
[01:35:53.880 --> 01:35:55.720]   and most of the mass of matter,
[01:35:55.720 --> 01:36:01.160]   but they don't, since they're so heavy,
[01:36:01.160 --> 01:36:03.760]   they don't move very much in chemistry
[01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:07.920]   and I'm oversimplifying drastically.
[01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:09.720]   - They're not contributing much to the interaction
[01:36:09.720 --> 01:36:10.560]   in chemistry.
[01:36:12.220 --> 01:36:13.620]   - For most purposes in chemistry,
[01:36:13.620 --> 01:36:16.100]   you can just idealize them as concentrations
[01:36:16.100 --> 01:36:18.700]   of positive mass and charge that are,
[01:36:18.700 --> 01:36:22.060]   you don't have to look inside,
[01:36:22.060 --> 01:36:24.220]   but people are curious what's inside.
[01:36:24.220 --> 01:36:29.260]   And that was a big thing on the agenda
[01:36:29.260 --> 01:36:32.480]   of 20th century physics starting in the 19,
[01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:34.480]   well, starting with the 20th century
[01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:38.220]   and unfolding throughout of trying to understand
[01:36:38.220 --> 01:36:41.580]   what forces held the atomic nucleus together,
[01:36:41.580 --> 01:36:42.700]   what it was and so on.
[01:36:42.700 --> 01:36:49.620]   Anyway, the story that emerges from QCD
[01:36:49.620 --> 01:36:55.540]   is that very similar to the way that,
[01:36:55.540 --> 01:37:00.380]   well, broadly similar to the way that clouds of electrons
[01:37:00.380 --> 01:37:04.460]   held together by electrical forces give you atoms
[01:37:04.460 --> 01:37:07.260]   and ultimately molecules,
[01:37:08.940 --> 01:37:13.700]   protons and neutrons are like atoms
[01:37:13.700 --> 01:37:17.780]   made now out of quarks, quark clouds held together
[01:37:17.780 --> 01:37:20.900]   by gluons, which are like the photons
[01:37:20.900 --> 01:37:23.540]   that give the electric forces,
[01:37:23.540 --> 01:37:26.460]   but this is giving a different force, the strong force.
[01:37:26.460 --> 01:37:31.460]   And the residual forces between protons and neutrons
[01:37:31.460 --> 01:37:36.740]   that are left over from the basic binding
[01:37:37.540 --> 01:37:40.060]   are like the residual forces between atoms
[01:37:40.060 --> 01:37:43.500]   that give molecules, but in the case of protons and neutrons
[01:37:43.500 --> 01:37:45.340]   it gives you atomic nuclei.
[01:37:45.340 --> 01:37:48.340]   - So again, for definitional purposes,
[01:37:48.340 --> 01:37:50.940]   QCD, quantum chromodynamics,
[01:37:50.940 --> 01:37:54.000]   is basically the physics of strong interaction.
[01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:58.660]   - Yeah, we now would, I think most physicists would say
[01:37:58.660 --> 01:38:03.140]   it's the theory of quarks and gluons and how they interact.
[01:38:04.220 --> 01:38:07.820]   But it's a very precise, and I think it's fair to say
[01:38:07.820 --> 01:38:11.900]   very beautiful theory based on mathematical symmetry
[01:38:11.900 --> 01:38:13.500]   of a high order.
[01:38:13.500 --> 01:38:17.020]   And another thing that's beautiful about it
[01:38:17.020 --> 01:38:19.180]   is that it's kind of
[01:38:19.180 --> 01:38:26.260]   in the same family as electrodynamics.
[01:38:26.260 --> 01:38:31.180]   The conceptual structure of the equations are very similar.
[01:38:31.180 --> 01:38:34.860]   They're based on having particles that respond to charge
[01:38:34.860 --> 01:38:37.140]   in a very symmetric way.
[01:38:37.140 --> 01:38:39.660]   In the case of electrodynamics,
[01:38:39.660 --> 01:38:42.060]   it's photons that respond to electric charge.
[01:38:42.060 --> 01:38:44.540]   In the case of quantum chromodynamics,
[01:38:44.540 --> 01:38:47.500]   there are three kinds of charge that we call colors,
[01:38:47.500 --> 01:38:49.340]   but they're nothing like colors.
[01:38:49.340 --> 01:38:51.900]   They really are like different kinds of charge.
[01:38:51.900 --> 01:38:54.540]   - But they rhyme with the same kind of,
[01:38:54.540 --> 01:38:56.580]   like it's similar kind of dynamics.
[01:38:56.580 --> 01:38:57.940]   - Similar kind of dynamics.
[01:38:58.300 --> 01:39:02.900]   I like to say that QCD is like QED on steroids.
[01:39:02.900 --> 01:39:05.860]   And instead of one photon, you have eight gluons.
[01:39:05.860 --> 01:39:09.140]   Instead of one charge, you have three color charges.
[01:39:09.140 --> 01:39:13.140]   But there's a strong family resemblance between them.
[01:39:13.140 --> 01:39:16.860]   - But the context in which QCD does this thing
[01:39:16.860 --> 01:39:19.360]   is at much higher energies.
[01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:20.500]   Like that's where it comes to life.
[01:39:20.500 --> 01:39:22.300]   - Well, it's a stronger force.
[01:39:22.300 --> 01:39:26.580]   So that to access how it works
[01:39:26.580 --> 01:39:28.140]   and kind of pry things apart,
[01:39:28.140 --> 01:39:30.380]   you have to inject more energy.
[01:39:30.380 --> 01:39:35.380]   - And so that gives us, in some sense,
[01:39:35.380 --> 01:39:39.460]   a hint of how things were in the earlier universe.
[01:39:39.460 --> 01:39:41.100]   - Yeah, well, in that regard,
[01:39:41.100 --> 01:39:43.760]   asymptotic freedom is a tremendous blessing
[01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:47.600]   because it means things get simpler at high energy.
[01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:50.060]   - The universe was born free.
[01:39:50.060 --> 01:39:52.660]   - Born free, that's very good, yes.
[01:39:52.660 --> 01:39:53.540]   The universe was born.
[01:39:53.540 --> 01:39:56.060]   So in atomic physics,
[01:39:56.060 --> 01:39:59.420]   I mean, a similar thing happens in the theory of stars.
[01:39:59.420 --> 01:40:03.420]   Stars are hot enough that the interactions
[01:40:03.420 --> 01:40:07.540]   between electrons and photons, they're liberated.
[01:40:07.540 --> 01:40:08.700]   They don't form atoms anymore.
[01:40:08.700 --> 01:40:10.480]   They make a plasma, which in some ways
[01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:12.300]   is simpler to understand.
[01:40:12.300 --> 01:40:14.640]   You don't have complicated chemistry.
[01:40:14.640 --> 01:40:18.140]   And in the early universe, according to QCD,
[01:40:18.140 --> 01:40:20.500]   similarly, atomic nuclei dissolved
[01:40:20.500 --> 01:40:22.900]   into the constituent quarks and gluons,
[01:40:22.900 --> 01:40:24.460]   which are moving around very fast
[01:40:24.460 --> 01:40:27.020]   and interacting in relatively simple ways.
[01:40:27.020 --> 01:40:30.580]   And so this opened up the early universe
[01:40:30.580 --> 01:40:33.580]   to scientific calculation.
[01:40:33.580 --> 01:40:35.820]   - Can I ask you about some other weird particles
[01:40:35.820 --> 01:40:37.900]   that make up our universe?
[01:40:37.900 --> 01:40:42.620]   What are axions and what is the strong CP problem?
[01:40:42.620 --> 01:40:47.620]   - Okay, so let me start with what the strong CP problem is.
[01:40:47.620 --> 01:40:53.700]   First of all, well, C is charge conjugation,
[01:40:53.700 --> 01:40:56.820]   which is the transformation,
[01:40:56.820 --> 01:40:59.940]   the notional transformation, if you like,
[01:40:59.940 --> 01:41:03.380]   that changes all particles into their antiparticles.
[01:41:03.380 --> 01:41:08.380]   And the concept of C symmetry,
[01:41:08.380 --> 01:41:12.260]   charge conjugation symmetry, is that if you do that,
[01:41:12.260 --> 01:41:15.420]   you find the same laws would work.
[01:41:15.420 --> 01:41:18.380]   So the laws are symmetric.
[01:41:18.380 --> 01:41:22.780]   If the behavior that particles exhibit is the same
[01:41:22.780 --> 01:41:27.140]   as the behavior you get with all their antiparticles,
[01:41:27.140 --> 01:41:33.580]   then P is parity, which is also called spatial inversion.
[01:41:33.580 --> 01:41:39.020]   It's basically looking at a mirror universe
[01:41:39.020 --> 01:41:41.900]   and saying that the laws that are obeyed
[01:41:41.900 --> 01:41:45.660]   in a mirror universe, when you look at the mirror images
[01:41:45.660 --> 01:41:50.420]   obey the same laws as the sources of their images.
[01:41:50.420 --> 01:41:52.820]   There's no way of telling left from right, for instance,
[01:41:52.820 --> 01:41:55.580]   that the laws don't distinguish between left and right.
[01:41:55.580 --> 01:42:01.340]   Now, in the mid 20th century, people discovered
[01:42:01.340 --> 01:42:03.620]   that both of those are not quite true.
[01:42:03.620 --> 01:42:09.180]   Really, the equation, the mirror universe,
[01:42:09.180 --> 01:42:14.180]   the universe that you see in a mirror
[01:42:14.180 --> 01:42:18.500]   is not gonna obey the same laws
[01:42:18.500 --> 01:42:23.500]   as the universe that we actually exhibit and interpret.
[01:42:23.500 --> 01:42:28.300]   You would be able to tell if you did the right kind
[01:42:28.300 --> 01:42:30.100]   of experiments, which was the mirror
[01:42:30.100 --> 01:42:31.540]   and which was the real thing.
[01:42:31.540 --> 01:42:34.820]   Anyway, that--
[01:42:34.820 --> 01:42:36.060]   - So that's the parity and they show
[01:42:36.060 --> 01:42:37.860]   that the parity doesn't necessarily hold.
[01:42:37.860 --> 01:42:39.060]   - It doesn't quite hold.
[01:42:39.060 --> 01:42:45.660]   Examining what the exceptions are turned out to be,
[01:42:45.660 --> 01:42:47.360]   to lead to all kinds of insight
[01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:49.820]   about the nature of fundamental interactions,
[01:42:49.820 --> 01:42:51.600]   especially properties of neutrinos
[01:42:51.600 --> 01:42:52.580]   and the weak interaction.
[01:42:52.580 --> 01:42:55.460]   It's a long story, but it's a very--
[01:42:55.460 --> 01:42:57.660]   - So you just define the C and the P,
[01:42:57.660 --> 01:42:59.420]   the conjugation, the charged conjugation.
[01:42:59.420 --> 01:43:00.860]   - Now that I've done that, I wanna--
[01:43:00.860 --> 01:43:01.700]   - What's the problem?
[01:43:01.700 --> 01:43:02.540]   - Shove them off.
[01:43:02.540 --> 01:43:04.020]   - Okay, great.
[01:43:04.020 --> 01:43:06.500]   - 'Cause it's easier to talk about T,
[01:43:06.500 --> 01:43:08.900]   which is time reversal symmetry.
[01:43:08.900 --> 01:43:13.180]   We have very good reasons to think CPT
[01:43:13.180 --> 01:43:17.140]   is an accurate symmetry of nature.
[01:43:17.140 --> 01:43:19.360]   It's on the same level as relativity
[01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:20.940]   and quantum mechanics, basically,
[01:43:20.940 --> 01:43:22.560]   so that better be true.
[01:43:22.560 --> 01:43:27.140]   - So it's symmetric when you do conjugation,
[01:43:27.140 --> 01:43:27.980]   parity, and time.
[01:43:27.980 --> 01:43:30.920]   - And time and space reversal.
[01:43:30.920 --> 01:43:32.840]   If you do all three, then you get
[01:43:32.840 --> 01:43:35.000]   the same physical consequences.
[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:39.680]   But that means that CP is equivalent to T.
[01:43:39.680 --> 01:43:42.640]   But what's observed in the world is that T
[01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:46.680]   is not quite an accurate symmetry of nature either.
[01:43:46.680 --> 01:43:51.680]   So most phenomena at the fundamental level,
[01:43:51.680 --> 01:43:54.660]   so interactions among elementary particles
[01:43:54.660 --> 01:43:57.500]   and the basic gravitational interaction,
[01:43:57.500 --> 01:44:02.380]   if you ran them backwards in time,
[01:44:02.380 --> 01:44:05.380]   you'd get the same laws.
[01:44:05.380 --> 01:44:08.400]   So if, again, going back,
[01:44:08.400 --> 01:44:11.460]   unless this time we don't talk about a mirror,
[01:44:11.460 --> 01:44:13.180]   but we talk about a movie,
[01:44:13.180 --> 01:44:18.180]   if you take a movie and then run it backwards,
[01:44:18.180 --> 01:44:20.280]   that's the time reversal.
[01:44:20.280 --> 01:44:23.340]   - It's cool to think about a mirror in time.
[01:44:23.340 --> 01:44:25.180]   - Yeah, it's like a mirror in time.
[01:44:25.180 --> 01:44:29.060]   If you run the movie backwards,
[01:44:29.060 --> 01:44:30.620]   it would look very strange
[01:44:30.620 --> 01:44:32.740]   if you were looking at complicated objects
[01:44:32.740 --> 01:44:37.340]   and a Charlie Chaplin movie or whatever.
[01:44:37.340 --> 01:44:40.180]   It would look very strange if you ran it backwards in time.
[01:44:40.180 --> 01:44:43.780]   But at the level of basic interactions,
[01:44:43.780 --> 01:44:45.940]   if you were able to look at the atoms
[01:44:45.940 --> 01:44:48.540]   and the quarks involved,
[01:44:48.540 --> 01:44:50.540]   they would obey the same laws
[01:44:50.540 --> 01:44:53.340]   to a very good approximation, but not exactly.
[01:44:53.340 --> 01:44:55.920]   - So not exactly, that means you could tell.
[01:44:55.920 --> 01:44:57.860]   - You could tell, but you'd have to do
[01:44:57.860 --> 01:45:01.900]   very, very subtle experiments
[01:45:01.900 --> 01:45:04.660]   with that high energy accelerators
[01:45:04.660 --> 01:45:06.700]   to take a movie that looked different
[01:45:06.700 --> 01:45:08.700]   when you ran it backwards.
[01:45:08.700 --> 01:45:13.700]   This was a discovery by two great physicists
[01:45:13.700 --> 01:45:17.500]   named Jim Cronin and Val Fitch
[01:45:17.500 --> 01:45:20.540]   in the mid 1960s.
[01:45:20.540 --> 01:45:22.460]   Previous to that, over all the centuries
[01:45:22.460 --> 01:45:25.220]   of development of physics with all its precise laws,
[01:45:25.220 --> 01:45:28.880]   they did seem to have this gratuitous property
[01:45:28.880 --> 01:45:33.300]   that they look the same if you run the equations backwards.
[01:45:33.300 --> 01:45:35.280]   It's kind of an embarrassing property actually,
[01:45:35.280 --> 01:45:38.500]   because life isn't like that.
[01:45:38.500 --> 01:45:41.860]   So empirical reality does not have this imagery
[01:45:41.860 --> 01:45:44.900]   in any obvious way, and yet the laws did.
[01:45:44.900 --> 01:45:46.280]   - It's almost like the laws of physics
[01:45:46.280 --> 01:45:48.700]   are missing something fundamental about life
[01:45:48.700 --> 01:45:51.340]   if it holds that property, right?
[01:45:51.340 --> 01:45:52.180]   - Well-- - I mean,
[01:45:52.180 --> 01:45:54.340]   that's the embarrassing nature of it.
[01:45:54.340 --> 01:45:55.220]   - Yeah, it's embarrassing.
[01:45:55.220 --> 01:46:00.220]   Well, people worked hard at what's,
[01:46:00.220 --> 01:46:04.780]   this is a problem that's thought to belong
[01:46:04.780 --> 01:46:07.140]   to the foundations of statistical mechanics
[01:46:07.140 --> 01:46:10.540]   or the foundations of thermodynamics
[01:46:10.540 --> 01:46:15.540]   to understand how behavior, which is grossly not symmetric
[01:46:15.540 --> 01:46:21.240]   with respect to reversing the direction of time
[01:46:21.240 --> 01:46:24.320]   in large objects, how that can emerge from equations
[01:46:24.320 --> 01:46:28.100]   which are symmetric with respect to changing
[01:46:28.100 --> 01:46:31.060]   the direction of time to a very good approximation.
[01:46:31.060 --> 01:46:33.140]   And that's still an interesting endeavor.
[01:46:33.140 --> 01:46:37.820]   That's interesting, and actually it's an exciting frontier
[01:46:37.820 --> 01:46:40.140]   of physics now to sort of explore the boundary
[01:46:40.140 --> 01:46:42.300]   between when that's true and when it's not true
[01:46:42.300 --> 01:46:44.460]   when you get to smaller objects
[01:46:44.460 --> 01:46:46.520]   and exceptions like time crystals.
[01:46:46.520 --> 01:46:49.420]   - I definitely have to ask you about time crystals
[01:46:49.420 --> 01:46:53.620]   in a second here, but so the CP problem and T,
[01:46:53.620 --> 01:46:55.620]   so there's flaws to all of these.
[01:46:55.620 --> 01:46:57.520]   - We're in danger of infinite regress,
[01:46:57.520 --> 01:46:59.180]   but we'll have to convert soon.
[01:46:59.180 --> 01:47:02.060]   - No, it can't possibly be turtles all the way down.
[01:47:02.060 --> 01:47:04.020]   We're gonna get to the bottom turtle.
[01:47:04.020 --> 01:47:08.860]   - So it became, so it got to be a real,
[01:47:08.860 --> 01:47:11.140]   I mean, it's a really puzzling thing
[01:47:11.140 --> 01:47:15.300]   why the laws should have this very odd property
[01:47:15.300 --> 01:47:19.940]   that we don't need, and in fact, it's kind of an embarrassment
[01:47:19.940 --> 01:47:22.140]   in addressing empirical reality,
[01:47:22.140 --> 01:47:24.620]   but it seemed to be almost,
[01:47:24.620 --> 01:47:26.940]   it seemed to be exactly true for a long time,
[01:47:26.940 --> 01:47:29.240]   and then almost true.
[01:47:30.980 --> 01:47:34.660]   And in a way, almost true is more disturbing
[01:47:34.660 --> 01:47:37.380]   than exactly true because exactly true,
[01:47:37.380 --> 01:47:39.780]   it could have been just a fundamental feature of the world,
[01:47:39.780 --> 01:47:42.300]   and at some level, you just have to take it as it is,
[01:47:42.300 --> 01:47:47.300]   and if it's a beautiful, easily articulatable regularity,
[01:47:47.300 --> 01:47:50.260]   you could say that, okay, that's fine
[01:47:50.260 --> 01:47:51.740]   as a fundamental law of nature,
[01:47:51.740 --> 01:47:54.220]   but to say that it's approximately true but not exactly,
[01:47:54.220 --> 01:47:55.060]   that's weird.
[01:47:55.060 --> 01:47:56.420]   - That's very weird.
[01:47:56.420 --> 01:48:00.900]   So, and then, so there was great progress
[01:48:00.900 --> 01:48:05.220]   in the late part of the 20th century
[01:48:05.220 --> 01:48:09.260]   in getting to an understanding
[01:48:09.260 --> 01:48:11.680]   of fundamental interactions in general
[01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:13.680]   that shed light on this issue.
[01:48:13.680 --> 01:48:19.780]   It turns out that the basic principles of relativity
[01:48:19.780 --> 01:48:25.740]   and quantum mechanics plus the kind of high degree
[01:48:25.740 --> 01:48:28.940]   of symmetry that we found, the so-called gauge symmetry
[01:48:28.940 --> 01:48:31.980]   that characterizes the fundamental interactions,
[01:48:31.980 --> 01:48:33.800]   when you put all that together,
[01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:36.560]   it's a very, very constraining framework,
[01:48:36.560 --> 01:48:40.560]   and it has some indirect consequences
[01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:45.940]   because the possible interactions are so constrained,
[01:48:45.940 --> 01:48:48.660]   and one of the indirect consequences
[01:48:48.660 --> 01:48:53.660]   is that the possibilities for violating the symmetry
[01:48:54.380 --> 01:48:57.900]   between forwards and backwards in time are very limited.
[01:48:57.900 --> 01:49:00.980]   There are basically only two, okay?
[01:49:00.980 --> 01:49:05.100]   And one of them occurs and leads to a very rich theory
[01:49:05.100 --> 01:49:07.580]   that explains the Cronin-Fitch experiment,
[01:49:07.580 --> 01:49:09.700]   and a lot of things that have been done subsequently
[01:49:09.700 --> 01:49:13.660]   has been used to make all kinds of successful predictions.
[01:49:13.660 --> 01:49:18.660]   So that's turned out to be a very rich interaction.
[01:49:18.660 --> 01:49:22.380]   It's esoteric, and the effects only show up
[01:49:22.380 --> 01:49:23.740]   at accelerators and are small,
[01:49:23.740 --> 01:49:25.500]   but they might've been very important
[01:49:25.500 --> 01:49:28.700]   in the early universe and be connected
[01:49:28.700 --> 01:49:31.420]   to the asymmetry between matter and antimatter
[01:49:31.420 --> 01:49:33.220]   in the present universe, and so on.
[01:49:33.220 --> 01:49:35.420]   But that's another digression.
[01:49:35.420 --> 01:49:41.180]   The point is that that was fine, that was a triumph
[01:49:41.180 --> 01:49:44.940]   to say that there was one possible kind of interaction
[01:49:44.940 --> 01:49:47.300]   that would violate time-reversal symmetry,
[01:49:47.300 --> 01:49:49.500]   and sure enough, there it is.
[01:49:49.500 --> 01:49:54.500]   But the other kind doesn't occur,
[01:49:54.500 --> 01:49:55.900]   so we still got a problem.
[01:49:55.900 --> 01:49:57.040]   Why doesn't it occur?
[01:49:57.040 --> 01:50:01.780]   So we're close to really finally understanding
[01:50:01.780 --> 01:50:04.740]   this profound, gratuitous feature of the world
[01:50:04.740 --> 01:50:08.380]   that is almost but not quite symmetric
[01:50:08.380 --> 01:50:12.260]   under reversing the direction of time, but not quite there.
[01:50:12.260 --> 01:50:17.060]   And to understand that last bit
[01:50:18.540 --> 01:50:21.820]   is a challenging frontier of physics today.
[01:50:21.820 --> 01:50:26.700]   And we have a promising proposal for how it works,
[01:50:26.700 --> 01:50:29.940]   which is a kind of theory of evolution.
[01:50:29.940 --> 01:50:35.600]   So there's this possible interaction,
[01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:39.100]   which we call a coupling, and there's a numerical quantity
[01:50:39.100 --> 01:50:41.460]   that tells us how strong that is.
[01:50:41.460 --> 01:50:43.640]   And traditionally in physics,
[01:50:43.640 --> 01:50:46.380]   we think of these kinds of numerical quantities
[01:50:46.380 --> 01:50:51.380]   as constants of nature that you just have to put them in,
[01:50:51.380 --> 01:50:57.020]   from experiment, they have a certain value and that's it.
[01:50:57.020 --> 01:51:02.020]   And who am I to question what God did?
[01:51:02.020 --> 01:51:04.620]   They seem to be just constants.
[01:51:04.620 --> 01:51:11.020]   But in this case, it's been fruitful to think
[01:51:13.420 --> 01:51:18.420]   and work out a theory where that strength of interaction
[01:51:18.420 --> 01:51:26.980]   is actually not a constant, it's a field.
[01:51:26.980 --> 01:51:32.380]   Fields are the fundamental ingredients of modern physics.
[01:51:32.380 --> 01:51:35.140]   Like there's an electron field, there's a photon field,
[01:51:35.140 --> 01:51:37.140]   which is also called the electromagnetic field.
[01:51:37.140 --> 01:51:40.180]   And so all of these particles are manifestations
[01:51:40.180 --> 01:51:45.180]   of different fields, and there could be a field,
[01:51:45.180 --> 01:51:47.700]   something that depends on space and time.
[01:51:47.700 --> 01:51:52.700]   So a dynamical entity instead of just a constant here.
[01:51:52.700 --> 01:51:58.060]   And if you do things in a nice way, that's very symmetric,
[01:51:58.060 --> 01:52:02.140]   very much suggested aesthetically by the theory,
[01:52:02.140 --> 01:52:08.020]   but the theory we do have, then you find that you get
[01:52:09.260 --> 01:52:14.260]   a field which as it evolves from the early universe,
[01:52:14.260 --> 01:52:22.220]   settles down to a value that's just right
[01:52:22.220 --> 01:52:29.460]   to make the laws very nearly exact,
[01:52:29.460 --> 01:52:33.580]   invariant or symmetric with respect to reversal of time.
[01:52:33.580 --> 01:52:34.740]   - It might appear as a constant,
[01:52:34.740 --> 01:52:36.580]   but it's actually a field that evolved over time.
[01:52:36.580 --> 01:52:38.460]   - It evolved over time, okay?
[01:52:38.460 --> 01:52:42.140]   But when you examine this proposal in detail,
[01:52:42.140 --> 01:52:47.040]   you find that it hasn't quite settled down to exactly zero.
[01:52:47.040 --> 01:52:52.020]   The field is still moving around a little bit.
[01:52:52.020 --> 01:52:57.020]   And because the motion is so difficult,
[01:52:57.020 --> 01:53:02.100]   the material is so rigid, and this material that fills,
[01:53:02.100 --> 01:53:03.940]   the field that fills all space is so rigid,
[01:53:03.940 --> 01:53:07.160]   even small amounts of motion can involve lots of energy.
[01:53:08.180 --> 01:53:13.180]   And that energy takes the form of particles,
[01:53:13.180 --> 01:53:17.820]   fields that are in motion are always associated
[01:53:17.820 --> 01:53:20.500]   with particles, and those are the axions.
[01:53:20.500 --> 01:53:23.340]   And if you calculate how much energy
[01:53:23.340 --> 01:53:26.060]   is in these residual oscillations,
[01:53:26.060 --> 01:53:30.260]   this axion gas that fills all the universe,
[01:53:30.260 --> 01:53:32.300]   if this fundamental theory is correct,
[01:53:32.300 --> 01:53:37.300]   you get just the right amount to make the dark matter
[01:53:37.740 --> 01:53:41.780]   that astronomers want, and it has just the right properties.
[01:53:41.780 --> 01:53:44.260]   So I'd love to believe that--
[01:53:44.260 --> 01:53:47.680]   - So that might be a thing that unlocks,
[01:53:47.680 --> 01:53:50.180]   might be the key to understanding dark matter.
[01:53:50.180 --> 01:53:51.540]   - Yeah, I'd like to think so.
[01:53:51.540 --> 01:53:54.180]   And many physicists are coming around to this point of view,
[01:53:54.180 --> 01:53:58.420]   which I've been a voice in the wilderness,
[01:53:58.420 --> 01:54:00.700]   I was a voice in the wilderness for a long time,
[01:54:00.700 --> 01:54:04.660]   but now it's become very popular, maybe even dominant.
[01:54:04.660 --> 01:54:09.660]   - So almost like, so this axion particle/field
[01:54:09.660 --> 01:54:14.020]   would be the thing that explains dark matter.
[01:54:14.020 --> 01:54:15.300]   - It explains, yeah, it would solve
[01:54:15.300 --> 01:54:17.980]   this fundamental question of, finally,
[01:54:17.980 --> 01:54:22.980]   of why the laws are almost, but not quite exactly,
[01:54:22.980 --> 01:54:26.540]   the same if you run them backwards in time,
[01:54:26.540 --> 01:54:30.380]   and then seemingly in a totally different
[01:54:30.380 --> 01:54:35.260]   conceptual universe, it would also provide,
[01:54:35.260 --> 01:54:37.980]   give us an understanding of the dark matter.
[01:54:37.980 --> 01:54:41.540]   That's not what it was designed for,
[01:54:41.540 --> 01:54:45.020]   and the theory wasn't proposed with that in mind,
[01:54:45.020 --> 01:54:47.940]   but when you work out the equations, that's what you get.
[01:54:47.940 --> 01:54:49.840]   - That's always a good sign, actually.
[01:54:49.840 --> 01:54:51.020]   (laughing)
[01:54:51.020 --> 01:54:54.860]   I think I vaguely read somewhere that there may be
[01:54:54.860 --> 01:54:59.580]   early experimental validation of axion,
[01:54:59.580 --> 01:55:03.100]   is that, am I reading the wrong?
[01:55:03.100 --> 01:55:05.580]   - Well, there have been quite a few false alarms,
[01:55:05.580 --> 01:55:08.100]   and I think there are some of them still,
[01:55:08.100 --> 01:55:10.140]   people desperately wanna find this thing,
[01:55:10.140 --> 01:55:15.980]   but I don't think any of them are convincing at this point,
[01:55:15.980 --> 01:55:20.460]   but there are very ambitious experiments,
[01:55:20.460 --> 01:55:24.900]   and you have to design new kinds of antennas
[01:55:24.900 --> 01:55:28.300]   that are capable of detecting these predicted particles,
[01:55:28.300 --> 01:55:31.340]   and it's very difficult, they interact very, very weakly.
[01:55:31.340 --> 01:55:33.740]   If it were easy, it would have been done already,
[01:55:33.740 --> 01:55:38.740]   but I think there's good hope that we can get down
[01:55:38.740 --> 01:55:41.700]   to the required sensitivity and actually test
[01:55:41.700 --> 01:55:46.000]   whether these ideas are right in coming years,
[01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:47.380]   or maybe decades.
[01:55:47.380 --> 01:55:50.420]   - And then understand one of the big mysteries,
[01:55:50.420 --> 01:55:53.860]   like literally big in terms of its fraction
[01:55:53.860 --> 01:55:55.420]   of the universe is dark matter.
[01:55:55.420 --> 01:55:56.540]   - Yes.
[01:55:56.540 --> 01:55:58.980]   - Let me ask you about, you mentioned a few times,
[01:55:58.980 --> 01:56:02.820]   time crystals, what are they?
[01:56:02.820 --> 01:56:05.340]   These things are, it's a very beautiful idea
[01:56:05.340 --> 01:56:08.820]   when we start to treat space and time
[01:56:08.820 --> 01:56:15.100]   as similar frameworks, physical phenomena.
[01:56:15.100 --> 01:56:17.460]   - Right, that's what motivated it.
[01:56:17.460 --> 01:56:19.220]   - First of all, what are crystals?
[01:56:19.220 --> 01:56:20.460]   - Yeah. - And what are time crystals?
[01:56:20.460 --> 01:56:24.500]   - Okay, so crystals are orderly arrangements
[01:56:24.500 --> 01:56:29.500]   of atoms in space, and many materials,
[01:56:29.500 --> 01:56:34.140]   if you cool them down gently,
[01:56:34.140 --> 01:56:41.300]   will form crystals, and so we say that that's
[01:56:41.300 --> 01:56:45.940]   a state of matter that forms spontaneously,
[01:56:45.940 --> 01:56:50.220]   and an important feature of that state of matter
[01:56:50.220 --> 01:56:53.860]   is that the end result, the crystal,
[01:56:54.700 --> 01:56:59.700]   has less symmetry than the equations
[01:56:59.700 --> 01:57:03.060]   that give rise to the crystal.
[01:57:03.060 --> 01:57:07.560]   So the equations, the basic equations of physics,
[01:57:07.560 --> 01:57:12.700]   are the same if you move a little bit,
[01:57:12.700 --> 01:57:15.580]   so you can move, they're homogeneous,
[01:57:15.580 --> 01:57:18.900]   but crystals aren't, the atoms are in particular places,
[01:57:18.900 --> 01:57:20.460]   though they have less symmetry.
[01:57:22.520 --> 01:57:25.180]   And time crystals are the same thing in time.
[01:57:25.180 --> 01:57:30.180]   Basically, but of course, so it's not positions of atoms,
[01:57:30.180 --> 01:57:35.200]   but it's orderly behavior that certain states of matter
[01:57:35.200 --> 01:57:41.000]   will arrange themselves into spontaneously
[01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:45.500]   if you treat them gently and let them do
[01:57:45.500 --> 01:57:46.760]   what they want to do.
[01:57:46.760 --> 01:57:50.000]   - But repeat in that same way indefinitely.
[01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:51.440]   - That's the crystalline form.
[01:57:51.440 --> 01:57:54.900]   You can also have time liquids,
[01:57:54.900 --> 01:57:57.380]   or you can have all kinds of other states of matter.
[01:57:57.380 --> 01:57:58.920]   You can also have space-time crystals
[01:57:58.920 --> 01:58:02.640]   where the pattern only repeats if,
[01:58:02.640 --> 01:58:04.600]   with each step of time, you also move it
[01:58:04.600 --> 01:58:07.280]   a certain direction in space.
[01:58:07.280 --> 01:58:12.280]   So yeah, but basically, it's states of matter
[01:58:12.280 --> 01:58:17.640]   that display structure in time spontaneously.
[01:58:17.640 --> 01:58:21.120]   - So here's the difference.
[01:58:21.120 --> 01:58:22.760]   When it happens in time,
[01:58:22.760 --> 01:58:27.760]   it sure looks a lot like it's motion,
[01:58:27.760 --> 01:58:29.440]   and if it repeats indefinitely,
[01:58:29.440 --> 01:58:32.000]   it sure looks a lot like perpetual motion.
[01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:32.840]   - Yeah.
[01:58:32.840 --> 01:58:35.060]   - Like, looks like free lunch.
[01:58:35.060 --> 01:58:39.240]   I was told that there's no such thing as free lunch.
[01:58:39.240 --> 01:58:42.440]   Does this violate laws of thermodynamics?
[01:58:42.440 --> 01:58:45.600]   - No, but it requires a critical examination
[01:58:45.600 --> 01:58:47.880]   of the laws of thermodynamics.
[01:58:47.880 --> 01:58:49.800]   I mean, let me say on background
[01:58:49.800 --> 01:58:51.520]   that the laws of thermodynamics
[01:58:51.520 --> 01:58:55.360]   are not fundamental laws of physics.
[01:58:55.360 --> 01:59:00.360]   They are things we prove under certain circumstances,
[01:59:00.360 --> 01:59:03.000]   emerge from the fundamental laws of physics.
[01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:06.660]   We don't posit them separately.
[01:59:06.660 --> 01:59:08.280]   They're meant to be deduced,
[01:59:08.280 --> 01:59:10.560]   and they can be deduced under limited circumstances,
[01:59:10.560 --> 01:59:12.800]   but not necessarily universally,
[01:59:12.800 --> 01:59:15.520]   and we're finding some of the subtleties
[01:59:15.520 --> 01:59:17.480]   and sort of except edge cases
[01:59:18.320 --> 01:59:21.040]   where they don't apply in a straightforward way,
[01:59:21.040 --> 01:59:23.540]   and this is one.
[01:59:23.540 --> 01:59:27.640]   So time crystals do obey,
[01:59:27.640 --> 01:59:30.360]   do have this structure in time,
[01:59:30.360 --> 01:59:31.960]   but it's not a free lunch,
[01:59:31.960 --> 01:59:35.700]   because although in a sense things are moving,
[01:59:35.700 --> 01:59:39.080]   they're already doing what they want to do.
[01:59:39.080 --> 01:59:40.360]   They're in there.
[01:59:40.360 --> 01:59:44.040]   So if you want to extract energy from it,
[01:59:44.040 --> 01:59:44.880]   you're gonna be foiled
[01:59:44.880 --> 01:59:47.840]   because there's no spare energy there.
[01:59:48.680 --> 01:59:53.680]   So you can add energy to it and kind of disturb it,
[01:59:53.680 --> 01:59:58.360]   but you can't extract energy from this motion
[01:59:58.360 --> 02:00:00.400]   because it wants to do,
[02:00:00.400 --> 02:00:03.400]   that's the lowest energy configuration that there is,
[02:00:03.400 --> 02:00:06.120]   so you can't get further energy out of it.
[02:00:06.120 --> 02:00:08.680]   - So in theory, I guess perpetual motion,
[02:00:08.680 --> 02:00:13.080]   you would be able to extract energy from it.
[02:00:13.080 --> 02:00:15.080]   If such a thing was to be created,
[02:00:15.080 --> 02:00:17.080]   you can then milk it for energy.
[02:00:17.080 --> 02:00:21.360]   - Well, what's usually meant in the literature
[02:00:21.360 --> 02:00:26.360]   of perpetual motion is a kind of macroscopic motion
[02:00:26.360 --> 02:00:29.400]   that you could extract energy from
[02:00:29.400 --> 02:00:33.560]   and somehow it would crank back up.
[02:00:33.560 --> 02:00:35.160]   That's not the case here.
[02:00:35.160 --> 02:00:36.320]   If you want to extract,
[02:00:36.320 --> 02:00:42.160]   this motion is not something you can extract energy from.
[02:00:42.160 --> 02:00:45.400]   If you intervene in the behavior,
[02:00:45.400 --> 02:00:48.920]   you can change it, but only by injecting energy,
[02:00:48.920 --> 02:00:51.120]   not by taking away energy.
[02:00:51.120 --> 02:00:54.200]   - You mentioned that a theory of everything
[02:00:54.200 --> 02:00:56.480]   may be quite difficult to come by.
[02:00:56.480 --> 02:00:58.520]   A theory of everything broadly defined,
[02:00:58.520 --> 02:01:00.760]   meaning truly a theory of everything.
[02:01:00.760 --> 02:01:03.120]   But let's look at a more narrow theory of everything,
[02:01:03.120 --> 02:01:07.160]   which is the way it's used often in physics,
[02:01:07.160 --> 02:01:12.160]   is a theory that unifies our current laws of physics
[02:01:13.160 --> 02:01:18.160]   general relativity, quantum field theory.
[02:01:18.160 --> 02:01:22.200]   Do you have thoughts on this dream
[02:01:22.200 --> 02:01:25.360]   of a theory of everything in physics?
[02:01:25.360 --> 02:01:26.560]   How close are we?
[02:01:26.560 --> 02:01:29.440]   Is there any promising ideas out there in your view?
[02:01:29.440 --> 02:01:31.080]   - Well, it would be nice to have.
[02:01:31.080 --> 02:01:34.080]   It would be aesthetically pleasing.
[02:01:34.080 --> 02:01:36.760]   - Will it be useful?
[02:01:36.760 --> 02:01:38.480]   - No, probably not.
[02:01:38.480 --> 02:01:40.000]   Well, I shouldn't.
[02:01:41.400 --> 02:01:45.040]   It's dangerous to say that, but probably not.
[02:01:45.040 --> 02:01:50.040]   I think we, certainly not in the foreseeable future.
[02:01:50.040 --> 02:01:54.240]   - Maybe to understand black holes?
[02:01:54.240 --> 02:01:57.640]   - Yeah, but that's, yes, maybe to understand black holes,
[02:01:57.640 --> 02:02:00.400]   but that's not useful.
[02:02:00.400 --> 02:02:02.640]   (laughing)
[02:02:02.640 --> 02:02:05.920]   And well, not only, I mean, to understand,
[02:02:05.920 --> 02:02:09.520]   it's worse, it's not useful in the sense
[02:02:09.520 --> 02:02:11.960]   that we're not gonna be basing any technology
[02:02:11.960 --> 02:02:14.200]   anytime soon on black holes,
[02:02:14.200 --> 02:02:16.500]   but it's more severe than that, I would say.
[02:02:16.500 --> 02:02:21.500]   It's that the kinds of questions about black holes
[02:02:21.500 --> 02:02:26.480]   that we can't answer within the framework of existing theory
[02:02:26.480 --> 02:02:33.480]   are ones that are not going to be susceptible
[02:02:33.480 --> 02:02:37.620]   to astronomical observation in the foreseeable future.
[02:02:37.620 --> 02:02:41.500]   They're questions about very, very small black holes
[02:02:41.500 --> 02:02:45.060]   when quantum effects come into play,
[02:02:45.060 --> 02:02:51.720]   so that black holes are, you know, not black holes.
[02:02:51.720 --> 02:02:55.360]   They're emitting this discovery of Hawking
[02:02:55.360 --> 02:02:57.100]   called Hawking radiation,
[02:02:57.100 --> 02:03:01.060]   which for astronomical black holes is a tiny, tiny effect
[02:03:01.060 --> 02:03:02.900]   that no one has ever observed.
[02:03:02.900 --> 02:03:04.540]   It's a prediction that's never been checked.
[02:03:04.540 --> 02:03:06.740]   - Like supermassive black holes that doesn't apply?
[02:03:06.740 --> 02:03:11.220]   - No, no, the predicted rate of radiation
[02:03:11.220 --> 02:03:13.580]   from those black holes is so tiny
[02:03:13.580 --> 02:03:15.460]   that it's absolutely unobservable
[02:03:15.460 --> 02:03:17.900]   and is overwhelmed by all kinds of other effects.
[02:03:17.900 --> 02:03:24.420]   So it's not practical in the sense of technology.
[02:03:24.420 --> 02:03:26.380]   It's not even practical in the sense
[02:03:26.380 --> 02:03:30.140]   of application to astronomy.
[02:03:30.140 --> 02:03:35.980]   We are existing theory of general relativity
[02:03:35.980 --> 02:03:38.980]   and quantum theory and our theory
[02:03:38.980 --> 02:03:41.660]   of the different fundamental forces
[02:03:41.660 --> 02:03:46.660]   is perfectly adequate to all problems of technology,
[02:03:46.660 --> 02:03:55.700]   for sure, and almost all problems of astrophysics
[02:03:55.700 --> 02:04:03.060]   and cosmology that appear,
[02:04:03.060 --> 02:04:06.580]   except with the notable exception
[02:04:06.580 --> 02:04:09.460]   of the extremely early universe, if you want to ask.
[02:04:09.460 --> 02:04:11.100]   What happened before the Big Bang
[02:04:11.100 --> 02:04:13.060]   or what happened right at the Big Bang,
[02:04:13.060 --> 02:04:17.340]   which would be a great thing to understand, of course.
[02:04:17.340 --> 02:04:19.180]   - Yes. - We don't.
[02:04:19.180 --> 02:04:21.140]   - But what about the engineering question?
[02:04:21.140 --> 02:04:23.940]   So if we look at space travel,
[02:04:23.940 --> 02:04:28.460]   so I think you've spoken with him, Eric Weinstein.
[02:04:28.460 --> 02:04:29.460]   - Oh, yeah. - Really,
[02:04:31.900 --> 02:04:36.020]   he says things like we want to get off this planet.
[02:04:36.020 --> 02:04:39.140]   His intuition is almost a motivator
[02:04:39.140 --> 02:04:42.300]   for the engineering project of space exploration.
[02:04:42.300 --> 02:04:44.740]   In order for us to crack this problem
[02:04:44.740 --> 02:04:47.460]   of becoming a multi-planetary species,
[02:04:47.460 --> 02:04:49.320]   we have to solve the physics problem.
[02:04:49.320 --> 02:04:51.460]   His intuition is like if we figure out
[02:04:51.460 --> 02:04:55.020]   what he calls the source code, which is like,
[02:04:55.020 --> 02:05:00.660]   a theory of everything might give us clues
[02:05:00.660 --> 02:05:04.260]   on how to start hacking the fabric of reality,
[02:05:04.260 --> 02:05:06.500]   like getting shortcuts, right?
[02:05:06.500 --> 02:05:10.100]   - It might, I can't say that it won't,
[02:05:10.100 --> 02:05:15.100]   but I can say that in the 1970s and early 1980s,
[02:05:15.100 --> 02:05:21.340]   we achieved huge steps in understanding matter.
[02:05:21.340 --> 02:05:28.740]   QCD, much better understanding of the weak interaction,
[02:05:28.740 --> 02:05:32.500]   much better understanding of quantum mechanics in general,
[02:05:32.500 --> 02:05:36.500]   and it's had minimal impact on technology.
[02:05:36.500 --> 02:05:38.020]   - On rocket design, on propulsion.
[02:05:38.020 --> 02:05:40.300]   - Certainly on rocket design, on anything,
[02:05:40.300 --> 02:05:42.620]   any technology whatsoever,
[02:05:42.620 --> 02:05:46.360]   and now we're talking about much more esoteric things,
[02:05:46.360 --> 02:05:48.780]   and since I don't know what they are,
[02:05:48.780 --> 02:05:51.180]   I can't say for sure that they won't affect technology,
[02:05:51.180 --> 02:05:52.700]   but I'm very, very skeptical
[02:05:52.700 --> 02:05:55.000]   that they would affect technology.
[02:05:57.780 --> 02:05:59.660]   Because to access them,
[02:05:59.660 --> 02:06:02.460]   you need very exotic circumstances
[02:06:02.460 --> 02:06:04.620]   to make new kinds of particles with high energy,
[02:06:04.620 --> 02:06:07.860]   you need accelerators that are very expensive,
[02:06:07.860 --> 02:06:10.220]   and you don't produce many of them, and so forth.
[02:06:10.220 --> 02:06:13.060]   It's just, it's a pipe dream, I think.
[02:06:13.060 --> 02:06:15.380]   Yeah, about space exploration.
[02:06:15.380 --> 02:06:18.140]   I'm not sure exactly what he has in mind,
[02:06:18.140 --> 02:06:23.140]   but to me, it's more a problem of,
[02:06:26.700 --> 02:06:29.300]   I don't know, something between biology and--
[02:06:29.300 --> 02:06:31.140]   - Oh yeah, automatically.
[02:06:31.140 --> 02:06:33.300]   Maybe a little AI.
[02:06:33.300 --> 02:06:35.460]   - And information processing.
[02:06:35.460 --> 02:06:36.860]   What you mean, how should I,
[02:06:36.860 --> 02:06:42.160]   I think human bodies are not well adapted to space.
[02:06:42.160 --> 02:06:46.380]   Even Mars, which is the closest thing
[02:06:46.380 --> 02:06:49.140]   to a kind of human environment
[02:06:49.140 --> 02:06:51.140]   that we're gonna find anywhere close by,
[02:06:51.140 --> 02:06:55.860]   very, very difficult to maintain humans on Mars.
[02:06:56.700 --> 02:07:01.700]   And gonna be very expensive and very unstable.
[02:07:01.700 --> 02:07:05.820]   But I think the process, however,
[02:07:05.820 --> 02:07:10.820]   if we take a broader view of what it means
[02:07:10.820 --> 02:07:16.900]   to bring human civilization outside of the Earth,
[02:07:16.900 --> 02:07:23.020]   if we're satisfied with sending minds out there
[02:07:23.020 --> 02:07:26.740]   that we can converse with, and actuators,
[02:07:26.740 --> 02:07:31.260]   and that we can manipulate,
[02:07:31.260 --> 02:07:33.740]   and sensors that we can get feedback from,
[02:07:33.740 --> 02:07:37.860]   I think that's where it's at.
[02:07:37.860 --> 02:07:41.540]   And I think that's so much more realistic.
[02:07:41.540 --> 02:07:45.780]   And I think that's the long-term future
[02:07:45.780 --> 02:07:48.140]   of space exploration.
[02:07:48.140 --> 02:07:50.620]   It's not hauling human bodies all over the place.
[02:07:50.620 --> 02:07:52.780]   That's just silly.
[02:07:52.780 --> 02:07:56.740]   - Well, it's possible that human bodies,
[02:07:56.740 --> 02:07:59.060]   so like you said, it's a biology problem.
[02:07:59.060 --> 02:08:03.500]   What's possible is that we extend human lifespan
[02:08:03.500 --> 02:08:04.620]   in some way.
[02:08:04.620 --> 02:08:07.500]   Just we have to look at a bigger picture.
[02:08:07.500 --> 02:08:09.400]   It could be just like you're saying,
[02:08:09.400 --> 02:08:12.380]   by sending robots with actuators
[02:08:12.380 --> 02:08:16.340]   and kind of extending our limbs.
[02:08:16.340 --> 02:08:19.140]   But it could also be extending some aspect of our minds,
[02:08:19.140 --> 02:08:19.980]   some information, all those kinds of things.
[02:08:19.980 --> 02:08:21.460]   - And it could be cyborgs.
[02:08:21.460 --> 02:08:23.820]   It could be--
[02:08:23.820 --> 02:08:24.780]   - Now we're talking.
[02:08:24.780 --> 02:08:25.620]   (Dave laughs)
[02:08:25.620 --> 02:08:26.620]   Now the game is fun.
[02:08:26.620 --> 02:08:31.620]   - It could be human brains or cells
[02:08:31.620 --> 02:08:36.220]   that realize something like human brain architecture
[02:08:36.220 --> 02:08:42.780]   within artificial environments,
[02:08:42.780 --> 02:08:46.220]   shells, if you like, that are more adapted
[02:08:46.220 --> 02:08:47.900]   to the conditions of space.
[02:08:49.540 --> 02:08:53.300]   So that's entirely, man-machine hybrids,
[02:08:53.300 --> 02:08:57.940]   as well as sort of remote outposts
[02:08:57.940 --> 02:08:59.220]   that we can communicate with.
[02:08:59.220 --> 02:09:01.660]   I think those will happen.
[02:09:01.660 --> 02:09:05.300]   - Yeah, to me, there's some sense in which,
[02:09:05.300 --> 02:09:07.340]   as opposed to understanding the physics
[02:09:07.340 --> 02:09:12.340]   of the fundamental fabric of the universe,
[02:09:12.340 --> 02:09:17.360]   I think getting to the physics of life,
[02:09:17.360 --> 02:09:20.820]   the physics of intelligence, the physics of consciousness,
[02:09:20.820 --> 02:09:24.820]   the physics of information that brings
[02:09:24.820 --> 02:09:29.380]   from which life emerges,
[02:09:29.380 --> 02:09:32.140]   that will allow us to do space exploration.
[02:09:32.140 --> 02:09:34.700]   - Yeah, well, I think physics in the larger sense
[02:09:34.700 --> 02:09:36.840]   has a lot to contribute here.
[02:09:36.840 --> 02:09:39.980]   Not the physics of finding fundamental new laws
[02:09:39.980 --> 02:09:44.820]   in the sense of another quark or axions even.
[02:09:46.780 --> 02:09:51.420]   But physics in the sense of,
[02:09:51.420 --> 02:09:53.460]   physics has a lot of experience
[02:09:53.460 --> 02:09:56.660]   in analyzing complex situations
[02:09:56.660 --> 02:09:58.220]   and analyzing new states of matter
[02:09:58.220 --> 02:10:00.140]   and devising new kinds of instruments
[02:10:00.140 --> 02:10:01.580]   that do clever things.
[02:10:01.580 --> 02:10:05.940]   Physics in that sense has enormous amounts
[02:10:05.940 --> 02:10:09.980]   to contribute to this kind of endeavor.
[02:10:09.980 --> 02:10:14.980]   But I don't think that looking for a so-called theory
[02:10:15.620 --> 02:10:19.020]   of everything has much to do with it at all.
[02:10:19.020 --> 02:10:24.020]   - What advice would you give to a young person today
[02:10:24.020 --> 02:10:26.380]   with a bit of fire in their eyes,
[02:10:26.380 --> 02:10:28.100]   high school student, college student,
[02:10:28.100 --> 02:10:30.460]   thinking about what to do with their life?
[02:10:30.460 --> 02:10:33.180]   Maybe advice about career
[02:10:33.180 --> 02:10:36.220]   or bigger advice about life in general?
[02:10:36.220 --> 02:10:38.900]   - Well, first, read fundamentals
[02:10:38.900 --> 02:10:43.900]   'cause there I've tried to give some coherent,
[02:10:44.820 --> 02:10:45.780]   deep advice.
[02:10:45.780 --> 02:10:48.980]   - That's fundamentals, 10 keys to reality
[02:10:48.980 --> 02:10:50.140]   by Frank Kulczak.
[02:10:50.140 --> 02:10:50.980]   - So that's a good place to start.
[02:10:50.980 --> 02:10:52.260]   - Available everywhere.
[02:10:52.260 --> 02:10:55.140]   - If you wanna learn what I can tell you.
[02:10:55.140 --> 02:10:57.740]   - Is there an audio book?
[02:10:57.740 --> 02:10:58.900]   I've read that. - Yes, yes,
[02:10:58.900 --> 02:10:59.980]   there is an audio book. - There's an audio book.
[02:10:59.980 --> 02:11:00.820]   That's awesome.
[02:11:00.820 --> 02:11:05.220]   - Yeah, I think I can give three pieces of wise advice
[02:11:05.220 --> 02:11:08.340]   that I think are generally applicable.
[02:11:08.340 --> 02:11:11.740]   One is to cast a wide net,
[02:11:13.540 --> 02:11:18.540]   to really look around and see what looks promising,
[02:11:18.540 --> 02:11:21.380]   what catches your imagination.
[02:11:21.380 --> 02:11:26.740]   And promise, yeah, and those,
[02:11:26.740 --> 02:11:28.340]   you have to balance those two things.
[02:11:28.340 --> 02:11:30.020]   You can have things that catch your imagination,
[02:11:30.020 --> 02:11:32.340]   but don't look promising in the sense
[02:11:32.340 --> 02:11:34.140]   that the questions aren't ripe,
[02:11:34.140 --> 02:11:37.820]   and things that you,
[02:11:37.820 --> 02:11:41.180]   and part of what makes things attractive
[02:11:41.180 --> 02:11:43.900]   is that whether you thought you liked them or not,
[02:11:43.900 --> 02:11:45.940]   is if you can see that there's ferment
[02:11:45.940 --> 02:11:47.140]   and new ideas coming out,
[02:11:47.140 --> 02:11:49.380]   that's attractive in itself.
[02:11:49.380 --> 02:11:52.340]   So when I started out, I thought I was,
[02:11:52.340 --> 02:11:53.540]   and when I was an undergraduate,
[02:11:53.540 --> 02:11:55.380]   I intended to study philosophy
[02:11:55.380 --> 02:11:57.620]   or questions of how mind emerges from matter,
[02:11:57.620 --> 02:12:00.260]   but I thought that that wasn't really ripe.
[02:12:00.260 --> 02:12:01.220]   - The timing isn't right yet.
[02:12:01.220 --> 02:12:02.980]   - The timing wasn't right
[02:12:02.980 --> 02:12:05.220]   for the kind of mathematical thinking
[02:12:05.220 --> 02:12:10.220]   and conceptualization that I really enjoy and am good at.
[02:12:11.220 --> 02:12:15.500]   But, so that's one thing,
[02:12:15.500 --> 02:12:17.260]   cast a wide net, look around.
[02:12:17.260 --> 02:12:23.780]   And that's a pretty easy thing to do today
[02:12:23.780 --> 02:12:27.060]   because of the internet.
[02:12:27.060 --> 02:12:30.020]   You can look at all kinds of things.
[02:12:30.020 --> 02:12:30.940]   You have to be careful though,
[02:12:30.940 --> 02:12:33.460]   because there's a lot of crap also,
[02:12:33.460 --> 02:12:36.580]   but you can sort of tell the difference
[02:12:36.580 --> 02:12:38.780]   if you do a little digging.
[02:12:39.860 --> 02:12:44.860]   The, so don't settle on just,
[02:12:44.860 --> 02:12:46.780]   what your thesis advisor tells you to do
[02:12:46.780 --> 02:12:49.100]   or what your teacher tells you to do.
[02:12:49.100 --> 02:12:54.100]   Look for yourself and get a sense of what seems promising,
[02:12:54.100 --> 02:12:57.660]   not what seemed promising 10 years ago.
[02:12:57.660 --> 02:13:03.580]   So that's one.
[02:13:03.580 --> 02:13:05.980]   Another thing is to,
[02:13:07.700 --> 02:13:09.940]   is kind of complimentary to that.
[02:13:09.940 --> 02:13:11.700]   Well, they're all complimentary.
[02:13:11.700 --> 02:13:17.820]   Complimentary to that is to read history
[02:13:17.820 --> 02:13:20.980]   and read the masters of the history of ideas
[02:13:20.980 --> 02:13:22.260]   and masters of ideas.
[02:13:22.260 --> 02:13:25.420]   I benefited enormously from,
[02:13:25.420 --> 02:13:30.420]   as early in my career, from reading in physics,
[02:13:30.420 --> 02:13:36.100]   Einstein in the original and Feynman's lectures
[02:13:36.100 --> 02:13:37.580]   as they were coming out.
[02:13:37.580 --> 02:13:40.500]   And Darwin, you know, these,
[02:13:40.500 --> 02:13:43.500]   you can learn what it is, and Galileo,
[02:13:43.500 --> 02:13:46.660]   you can learn what it is to wrestle with difficult ideas
[02:13:46.660 --> 02:13:48.140]   and how great minds did that.
[02:13:48.140 --> 02:13:51.180]   You can learn a lot about style,
[02:13:51.180 --> 02:13:56.180]   how to write your ideas up and express them in clear ways.
[02:13:56.180 --> 02:14:00.180]   - And also just a couple of that with,
[02:14:00.180 --> 02:14:02.260]   I also enjoy reading biographies.
[02:14:02.260 --> 02:14:04.140]   - And biographies, yes, similarly, right.
[02:14:04.140 --> 02:14:06.300]   - Like, so it gives you the context
[02:14:06.300 --> 02:14:08.900]   of the human being that created those ideas.
[02:14:08.900 --> 02:14:11.820]   - Right, and brings it down to earth in the sense that,
[02:14:11.820 --> 02:14:14.340]   you know, it was really human beings who did this.
[02:14:14.340 --> 02:14:17.300]   And they made mistakes.
[02:14:17.300 --> 02:14:22.940]   I also got inspiration from Bertrand Russell,
[02:14:22.940 --> 02:14:24.620]   who was a big hero, and H.G. Wells.
[02:14:24.620 --> 02:14:29.060]   And yeah, so read the masters,
[02:14:29.060 --> 02:14:31.380]   make contact with great minds.
[02:14:31.380 --> 02:14:33.820]   And when you are sort of narrowing down on a subject,
[02:14:33.820 --> 02:14:35.420]   learn about the history of the subject
[02:14:35.420 --> 02:14:38.340]   because that really puts in context
[02:14:38.340 --> 02:14:39.620]   what you're trying to do,
[02:14:39.620 --> 02:14:44.660]   and also gives a sense of community and grandeur
[02:14:44.660 --> 02:14:45.980]   to the whole enterprise.
[02:14:45.980 --> 02:14:48.860]   And then the third piece of advice
[02:14:48.860 --> 02:14:51.820]   is complimentary to both those,
[02:14:51.820 --> 02:14:56.820]   which is sort of to get the basics under control
[02:14:56.820 --> 02:15:00.380]   as soon as possible.
[02:15:00.380 --> 02:15:04.180]   So if you want to do theoretical work in science,
[02:15:04.180 --> 02:15:08.380]   you know, you have to learn calculus,
[02:15:08.380 --> 02:15:11.540]   multivariable calculus, complex variables, group theory.
[02:15:11.540 --> 02:15:15.260]   Nowadays, you have to be highly computer literate.
[02:15:15.260 --> 02:15:16.500]   If you want to do experimental work,
[02:15:16.500 --> 02:15:17.900]   you also have to be computer literate,
[02:15:17.900 --> 02:15:19.620]   then you have to learn about electronics
[02:15:19.620 --> 02:15:22.220]   and optics and instruments and so on.
[02:15:22.220 --> 02:15:26.820]   So get that under control as soon as possible
[02:15:26.820 --> 02:15:29.220]   because it's like learning a language.
[02:15:29.220 --> 02:15:34.220]   To produce great works and express yourself fluently
[02:15:34.220 --> 02:15:39.380]   and with confidence, it should be your native language.
[02:15:39.380 --> 02:15:41.380]   These things should be like your native language.
[02:15:41.380 --> 02:15:44.660]   So you're not wondering, "Hmm, what is a derivative?"
[02:15:44.660 --> 02:15:45.820]   (laughs)
[02:15:45.820 --> 02:15:47.620]   This is just part of your, you know,
[02:15:47.620 --> 02:15:51.860]   it's in your bones, so to speak, you know?
[02:15:51.860 --> 02:15:55.020]   And the sooner that you can do that, then the better.
[02:15:55.020 --> 02:15:57.940]   So all those things can be done in parallel and should be.
[02:15:57.940 --> 02:15:59.020]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:15:59.020 --> 02:16:04.500]   You've accomplished some incredible things in your life,
[02:16:04.500 --> 02:16:09.500]   but the sad thing about this thing we have is it ends.
[02:16:09.500 --> 02:16:15.260]   Do you think about your mortality?
[02:16:15.260 --> 02:16:16.460]   Are you afraid of death?
[02:16:16.460 --> 02:16:20.420]   - Well, afraid is the wrong word.
[02:16:20.420 --> 02:16:21.740]   I mean--
[02:16:21.740 --> 02:16:22.580]   - Let's define it then.
[02:16:22.580 --> 02:16:25.820]   - I wish it weren't gonna happen, and I'd like to, but--
[02:16:27.020 --> 02:16:28.900]   - Do you think about it?
[02:16:28.900 --> 02:16:30.500]   - Occasionally, I think about,
[02:16:30.500 --> 02:16:32.420]   well, I think about it very operationally
[02:16:32.420 --> 02:16:35.520]   in the sense that there's always a trade-off
[02:16:35.520 --> 02:16:39.520]   between exploration and exploitation.
[02:16:39.520 --> 02:16:42.620]   This is a classic subject in computer science,
[02:16:42.620 --> 02:16:44.120]   actually, in machine learning,
[02:16:44.120 --> 02:16:48.420]   that when you're in an unusual circumstance,
[02:16:48.420 --> 02:16:52.580]   you want to explore to see what the landscape is
[02:16:52.580 --> 02:16:55.880]   and gather data, but then at some point,
[02:16:55.880 --> 02:16:59.700]   you want to use that, make choices,
[02:16:59.700 --> 02:17:00.940]   and say, "This is what I'm gonna do,"
[02:17:00.940 --> 02:17:03.420]   and exploit the knowledge you've accumulated.
[02:17:03.420 --> 02:17:08.420]   And the longer the period of exploitation you anticipate,
[02:17:08.420 --> 02:17:14.620]   the more exploration you should do in new directions.
[02:17:14.620 --> 02:17:18.780]   And so for me, I've had to sort of adjust the balance
[02:17:18.780 --> 02:17:21.780]   of exploration and exploitation,
[02:17:25.020 --> 02:17:25.900]   and--
[02:17:25.900 --> 02:17:28.180]   - That's it, you've explored quite a lot.
[02:17:28.180 --> 02:17:31.960]   - Yeah, well, I haven't shut off the exploitation at all.
[02:17:31.960 --> 02:17:32.800]   I'm still hoping for--
[02:17:32.800 --> 02:17:33.960]   - The exploration.
[02:17:33.960 --> 02:17:35.140]   - The exploration, right.
[02:17:35.140 --> 02:17:38.240]   I'm still hoping for 10 or 15 years
[02:17:38.240 --> 02:17:40.920]   of top flight performance, but the...
[02:17:40.920 --> 02:17:46.020]   Several years ago now, when I was 50 years old,
[02:17:46.020 --> 02:17:49.500]   I was at the Institute for Advanced Study,
[02:17:49.500 --> 02:17:52.460]   and my office was right under Freeman Dyson's office,
[02:17:52.460 --> 02:17:53.900]   and we were kind of friendly.
[02:17:53.900 --> 02:17:58.740]   And he found out it was my 50th birthday,
[02:17:58.740 --> 02:18:03.020]   and said, "Congratulations, and you should feel liberated,"
[02:18:03.020 --> 02:18:05.020]   because no one expects much
[02:18:05.020 --> 02:18:07.460]   of a 50-year-old theoretical physicist.
[02:18:07.460 --> 02:18:10.100]   And he obviously had felt liberated
[02:18:10.100 --> 02:18:13.180]   by reaching a certain age.
[02:18:13.180 --> 02:18:15.020]   And yeah, there is something to that.
[02:18:15.020 --> 02:18:21.660]   I feel I don't have to keep in touch
[02:18:21.660 --> 02:18:25.020]   with the latest hyper-technical developments
[02:18:25.020 --> 02:18:27.460]   in particle physics or string theory or something,
[02:18:27.460 --> 02:18:32.560]   because I'm really not gonna be exploiting that.
[02:18:32.560 --> 02:18:37.620]   But I am exploring in these directions
[02:18:37.620 --> 02:18:40.940]   of machine learning and things like that.
[02:18:40.940 --> 02:18:43.940]   But I'm also concentrating within physics
[02:18:43.940 --> 02:18:48.020]   on exploiting directions that I've already established
[02:18:48.020 --> 02:18:50.020]   and the laws that we already have,
[02:18:50.020 --> 02:18:52.420]   and doing things like...
[02:18:52.420 --> 02:18:58.260]   I'm very actively involved in trying to design,
[02:18:58.260 --> 02:19:02.620]   helping people, experimentalists and engineers even,
[02:19:02.620 --> 02:19:07.620]   to design antennas that are capable of detecting axions.
[02:19:07.620 --> 02:19:10.940]   So there, and that's, there we're deep
[02:19:10.940 --> 02:19:13.100]   in the exploitation stage.
[02:19:13.100 --> 02:19:14.920]   It's not a matter of finding the new laws,
[02:19:14.920 --> 02:19:17.820]   but of really using the laws we have
[02:19:17.820 --> 02:19:20.820]   to kind of finish the story off.
[02:19:20.820 --> 02:19:22.260]   So it's complicated.
[02:19:22.260 --> 02:19:27.260]   But I'm very happy with my life right now,
[02:19:27.260 --> 02:19:31.660]   and I'm enjoying it, and I don't wanna cloud that
[02:19:31.660 --> 02:19:36.660]   by thinking too much that it's gonna come to an end.
[02:19:36.660 --> 02:19:42.060]   It's a gift I didn't earn.
[02:19:42.060 --> 02:19:47.060]   - Is there a good thing to say about why
[02:19:48.020 --> 02:19:51.160]   this gift that you've gotten and didn't deserve
[02:19:51.160 --> 02:19:53.080]   is so damn enjoyable?
[02:19:53.080 --> 02:19:57.220]   So like, what's the meaning of this thing, of life?
[02:19:57.220 --> 02:20:01.540]   - To me, interacting with people I love, my family,
[02:20:01.540 --> 02:20:04.900]   and I have a very wide circle of friends now,
[02:20:04.900 --> 02:20:08.940]   and I'm trying to produce some institutions
[02:20:08.940 --> 02:20:12.100]   that will survive me as well as my work.
[02:20:14.940 --> 02:20:18.740]   And it's just, it's, how should I say?
[02:20:18.740 --> 02:20:22.540]   It's a positive feedback work loop
[02:20:22.540 --> 02:20:26.340]   when you do something and people appreciate it,
[02:20:26.340 --> 02:20:30.140]   and then you wanna do more, and they get rewarded.
[02:20:30.140 --> 02:20:32.220]   And it's just, how should I say?
[02:20:32.220 --> 02:20:34.060]   This is another gift that I didn't earn
[02:20:34.060 --> 02:20:37.580]   and don't understand, but I have a dopamine system.
[02:20:37.580 --> 02:20:42.300]   And yeah, I'm happy to use it.
[02:20:42.300 --> 02:20:47.300]   - It seems to get energized by the creative process,
[02:20:47.300 --> 02:20:48.860]   by the process of exploration.
[02:20:48.860 --> 02:20:49.700]   - Very much so.
[02:20:49.700 --> 02:20:54.220]   - And all of that started from the little fluctuations
[02:20:54.220 --> 02:20:58.620]   shortly after the Big Bang.
[02:20:58.620 --> 02:21:01.620]   Frank, well, whatever those initial conditions
[02:21:01.620 --> 02:21:04.580]   and fluctuation did that created you, I'm glad they did.
[02:21:04.580 --> 02:21:07.620]   This was, thank you for all the work you've done,
[02:21:07.620 --> 02:21:10.100]   for the many people you've inspired, for the many,
[02:21:10.100 --> 02:21:13.500]   of the billion, most of your ideas were pretty useless
[02:21:13.500 --> 02:21:17.780]   of the several billions, as it is for all humans,
[02:21:17.780 --> 02:21:21.760]   but you had quite a few truly special ideas.
[02:21:21.760 --> 02:21:23.580]   And thank you for bringing those to the world,
[02:21:23.580 --> 02:21:26.580]   and thank you for wasting your valuable time with me today.
[02:21:26.580 --> 02:21:27.740]   It's truly an honor.
[02:21:27.740 --> 02:21:31.780]   - It's been a joy, and I hope people enjoy it.
[02:21:31.780 --> 02:21:36.780]   And I think the kind of mind expansion that I've enjoyed
[02:21:37.100 --> 02:21:41.220]   by interacting with physical reality at this deep level,
[02:21:41.220 --> 02:21:45.500]   I think can be conveyed to and enjoyed by many, many people.
[02:21:45.500 --> 02:21:47.860]   And that's one of my missions in life this year.
[02:21:47.860 --> 02:21:49.340]   - Beautiful.
[02:21:49.340 --> 02:21:50.860]   Thanks for listening to this conversation
[02:21:50.860 --> 02:21:54.020]   with Frank Wilczek, and thank you to The Information,
[02:21:54.020 --> 02:21:58.460]   NetSuite, ExpressVPN, Blinkist, and 8sleep.
[02:21:58.460 --> 02:22:01.660]   Check them out in the description to support this podcast.
[02:22:01.660 --> 02:22:03.260]   And now let me leave you with some words
[02:22:03.260 --> 02:22:05.180]   from Albert Einstein.
[02:22:05.180 --> 02:22:08.300]   "Nothing happens until something moves."
[02:22:08.300 --> 02:22:12.140]   Thanks for listening, and hope to see you next time.
