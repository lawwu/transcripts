[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920]   the act of remembering can change the memory.
[00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.240]   If you remember some event
[00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.240]   and then I tell you something about the event,
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.020]   later on when you remember the event,
[00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.360]   you might remember some original information from the event
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.600]   as well as some information about what I told you.
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.200]   And sometimes if you're not able to tell the difference,
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.640]   that information that I told you
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.760]   gets mixed into the story that you had originally.
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.160]   So now I give you some more misinformation
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.800]   or you're exposed to some more information,
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.400]   somewhere else, and eventually your memory
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.820]   becomes totally detached from what happened.
[00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.240]   - The following is a conversation with Charan Ranganath,
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.560]   a psychologist and neuroscientist at UC Davis,
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.680]   specializing in human memory.
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.640]   He's the author of "Why We Remember,"
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.340]   unlocking memory's power to hold on to what matters.
[00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.600]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.

[00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.080]   in the description.
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.760]   And now, dear friends, here's Charan Ranganath.
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.920]   Danny Kahneman describes the experiencing self
[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.600]   and the remembering self.
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.840]   And that happiness and satisfaction you gain
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.280]   from the outcomes of your decisions
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.640]   did not come from what you've experienced,
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.240]   but rather from what you remember of the experience.
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.520]   So can you speak to this interesting difference
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.920]   that you write about in your book
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.000]   of the experiencing self and the remembering self?
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.680]   - Danny really impacted me
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.280]   'cause I was an undergrad at Berkeley
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.360]   and I got to take a class from him
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.340]   long before he won the Nobel Prize or anything,
[00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.920]   and it was just a mind-blowing class.
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.320]   But this idea of the remembering self
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.800]   and the experiencing self,
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.480]   I got into it because it's so much about memory,
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.200]   even though he doesn't study memory.
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.040]   So we're right now having this experience, right?
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.040]   And people can watch it, presumably on YouTube,
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.800]   or listen to it on audio.
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.720]   But if you're talking to somebody else,
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.640]   you could probably describe this whole thing in 10 minutes,
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.820]   but that's going to miss a lot of what actually happened.
[00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.760]   And so the idea there is that the way we remember things
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.660]   is not the replay of the experience,
[00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.400]   it's something totally different.
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.280]   And it tends to be biased by the beginning and the end,
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.200]   and he talks about the peaks,
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.720]   but there's also the best parts, the worst parts, et cetera.
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.900]   And those are the things that we remember.
[00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.360]   And so when we make decisions,
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.840]   we usually consult memory,
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.280]   and we feel like our memory is a record
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.040]   of what we've experienced, but it's not.
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.640]   It's this kind of very biased sample,
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.400]   but it's biased in an interesting,
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.640]   and I think biologically relevant way.
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.120]   - So in the way we construct a narrative about our past,
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:49.160]   you say that it gives us an illusion of stability.
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.880]   Can you explain that?
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.320]   - Basically, I think that a lot of learning in the brain
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.320]   is driven towards being able to make sense.
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.780]   I mean, really, memory is all about
[00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.240]   the present and the future.
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.440]   The past is done, so biologically speaking,
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.800]   it's not important unless there's something
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.940]   from the past that's useful.
[00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.600]   And so what our brains are really optimized for
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.660]   is to learn about the stuff from the past
[00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.840]   that's going to be most useful in understanding the present
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.960]   and predicting the future, right?
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.320]   And so cause-effect relationships, for instance,
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.620]   that's a big one.
[00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.320]   Now, my future is completely unpredictable
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.480]   in the sense that you could, in the next 10 minutes,
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.440]   pull a knife on me and slip my throat, right?
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.280]   - I was planning on it.
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.080]   - Exactly, but having seen some of your work,
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.600]   I just generally, my expectations about life,
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.160]   I'm not expecting that.
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.160]   I have a certainty that everything's gonna be fine
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.880]   and we're gonna have a great time talking today, right?
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.360]   But we're often right.
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.080]   It's like, okay, so I go to see a band on stage.
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.040]   I know they're gonna make me wait,
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.720]   the show's gonna start late.
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.900]   And then, you know, they come on,
[00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.520]   there's a very good chance there's gonna be an encore.
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.820]   I have a memory, so to speak, for that event
[00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.080]   before I've even walked into the show, right?
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.580]   There's gonna be people holding up their camera phones,
[00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.160]   trying to take videos of it now,
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.880]   'cause this is kind of the world we live in.
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.120]   So that's like everyday fortune telling that we do, though.
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.200]   It's not real, it's imagined.
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.200]   And it's amazing that we have this capability
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.900]   and that's what memory is about.
[00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.000]   But it can also give us this illusion
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.520]   that we know everything that's about to happen.
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.640]   And I think what's valuable about that illusion
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.480]   is when it's broken, it gives us the information, right?
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.800]   So, I mean, I'm sure being an AI,
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.480]   you know about information theory.
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.080]   And the idea is the information
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.080]   is what you didn't already have.
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.240]   And so those prediction errors that we make based on,
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.840]   you know, we make a prediction based on memory
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.240]   and the errors are where the action is.
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.980]   The error is where the learning happens.
[00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.020]   - Exactly, exactly.
[00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.380]   - Well, just to linger on Danny Kahneman
[00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.260]   and just this whole idea of experiencing self
[00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.820]   versus remembering self, I was hoping you can give
[00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.100]   a simple answer of how we should live life.
[00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:15.960]   Based on the fact that our memories
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.780]   could be a source of happiness
[00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:20.460]   or could be the primary source of happiness,
[00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.460]   that an event, when experienced,
[00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.140]   bears its fruits the most when it's remembered
[00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:29.540]   over and over and over and over.
[00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.420]   And maybe there is some wisdom in the fact
[00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:36.260]   that we can control, to some degree, how we remember it,
[00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.020]   how we evolve our memory of it,
[00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.840]   such that it can maximize the long-term happiness
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.300]   of that repeated experience.
[00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.580]   - Okay, well, first I'll say,
[00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.380]   I wish I could take you on the road with me,
[00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.420]   'cause that was such a great description.
[00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.820]   - Can I be your opening excerpt?
[00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:56.020]   - Oh my God, no, I'm gonna open for you, dude.
[00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.220]   Otherwise, it's like, you know,
[00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:58.960]   everybody leaves after you're done.
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.100]   (both laughing)
[00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.960]   Believe me, I did that in Columbus, Ohio once.
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:04.880]   It wasn't fun.
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.820]   Like, the opening acts, like, drank our bar tab.
[00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.900]   We spent all this money going all the way there.
[00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.860]   There was only the, everybody left
[00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.260]   after the opening acts were done
[00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.020]   and there was just that stoner dude
[00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.860]   with the dreadlocks hanging out.
[00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:17.820]   And then next thing you know,
[00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:21.140]   we blew, like, our savings on getting a hotel room.
[00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:21.980]   (both laughing)
[00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:23.700]   - So we should, as a small tangent,
[00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.580]   you're a legit touring act.
[00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:28.660]   - When I was in grad school, I played in a band.
[00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.580]   And yeah, we traveled, we would play shows.
[00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.400]   It wasn't like, we were in a hardcore touring band,
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.460]   but we did some touring and had some fun times.
[00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.380]   And yeah, we did a movie soundtrack.
[00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:40.220]   - Nice.
[00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:41.540]   - "Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer."
[00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:42.860]   So that's a good movie.
[00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.660]   We were on the soundtrack for the sequel,
[00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:48.300]   "Henry II, Mask of Sanity," which is a terrible movie.
[00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:49.420]   - How's the soundtrack?
[00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:50.260]   It's pretty good.
[00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:51.080]   - It's badass.
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:52.260]   At least that one part where the guy
[00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.940]   throws up the milkshake, which is my song.
[00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:56.900]   - We're gonna have to see, we're gonna have to see it.
[00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.100]   - All right, we'll get you back to life advice.
[00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.940]   - And happiness, yeah.
[00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.820]   - One thing that I try to live by, especially nowadays,
[00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:04.980]   and since I wrote the book,
[00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:06.700]   I've been thinking more and more about this,
[00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:11.300]   is how do I want to live a memorable life?
[00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:15.540]   I think if we go back to the pandemic, right?
[00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:19.180]   How many people have memories from that period?
[00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:22.200]   Aside from the trauma of being locked up
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.480]   and seeing people die and all this stuff.
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.740]   I think it's like one of these things
[00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:31.980]   where we were stuck inside looking at screens all day,
[00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:34.900]   doing the same thing with the same people.
[00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.740]   And so I don't remember much from that
[00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:39.100]   in terms of those good memories
[00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:40.940]   that you're talking about, right?
[00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:41.940]   You know, when I was growing up,
[00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:44.060]   my parents worked really hard for us,
[00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:48.860]   and we went on some vacations, but not very often.
[00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:52.580]   And I really try to do now vacations to interesting places
[00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:54.540]   as much as possible with my family,
[00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:58.260]   because those are the things that you remember, right?
[00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:03.260]   So I really do think about what's going to be something
[00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.700]   that's memorable, and then just do it,
[00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:06.980]   even if it's a pain in the ass,
[00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:10.060]   because the experiencing self will suffer for that,
[00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:11.580]   but the remembering self will be like,
[00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:13.540]   yes, I'm so glad I did that.
[00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:16.380]   - Do things that are very unpleasant in the moment,
[00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:19.060]   because those can be reframed and enjoyed
[00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:20.900]   for many years to come.
[00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:24.060]   That's probably good advice,
[00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:25.500]   or at least when you're going through shit,
[00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:29.340]   it's a good way to see the silver lining of it.
[00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:31.320]   - Yeah, I mean, I think it's one of these things
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:35.580]   where if you have people who you've gone through,
[00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:36.660]   since you said it, I'll just say it,
[00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:38.560]   since you've gone through shit with someone,
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:43.100]   and it's like, that's a bonding experience often, you know?
[00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:45.360]   I mean, that can really bring you together.
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.580]   I like to say it's like, there's no point in suffering
[00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:49.100]   unless you get a story out of it.
[00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:50.000]   (laughs)
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.200]   So in the book, I talk about the power
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.440]   of the way we communicate with others
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.200]   and how that shapes our memories.
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.600]   And so I had this near-death experience,
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.480]   at least that's how I remember it, on this paddleboard,
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.500]   where just everything that could have gone wrong
[00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.760]   did go wrong, almost.
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:11.760]   So many mistakes were made and ended up at some point
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:15.920]   just basically away from my board,
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:18.840]   pinned in a current in this corner,
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:21.000]   not a super good swimmer.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.340]   And my friend who came with me, Randy,
[00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:24.940]   who's a computational neuroscientist,
[00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:27.720]   and he had just been pushed down past me
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.480]   and so he couldn't even see me.
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:32.360]   And I'm just like, if I die here,
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:37.120]   I mean, no one's around, it's like you're just I alone.
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:39.680]   And so I just said, well, failure's not an option.
[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:44.680]   And eventually I got out of it and froze and got cut up.
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:47.440]   And I mean, the things that we were going through
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:48.440]   were just insane.
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:53.440]   But a short version of this is my wife and my daughter
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:58.200]   and Randy's wife, they gave us all sorts of hell about this
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.740]   'cause they were ready to send out a search party.
[00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:04.440]   So they were giving me hell about it.
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:07.400]   And then I started to tell people in my lab about this
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:08.240]   and then friends.
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:11.260]   And it just became a better and better story every time.
[00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.200]   And we actually had some photos of just the crazy things
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:17.080]   like this generator that was hanging over the water
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:20.040]   and we're like ducking under these metal gratings
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.880]   and I'm like going flat.
[00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:26.360]   And it was just nuts, but it became a great story.
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.040]   And it was definitely, I mean, Randy and I were already
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.560]   tight, but that was a real bonding experience for us.
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:33.480]   And yeah, I mean, and I learned from that,
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:37.560]   that it's like, I don't look back on that enough actually,
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:41.800]   because I think we often, at least for me,
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:44.000]   I don't necessarily have the confidence to think
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.520]   that things will work out,
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.760]   that I'll be able to get through certain things.
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:52.760]   But my ability to actually get something done in that moment
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:55.680]   is better than I give myself credit for, I think.
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.200]   And that was the lesson of that story
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.440]   that I really took away.
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:03.000]   - Well, actually just for me, you're making me realize now
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.720]   that it's not just those kinds of stories,
[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:10.040]   but even things like periods of depression
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:12.200]   or really low points.
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:15.960]   To me at least, it feels like a motivating thing
[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:19.760]   that the darker it gets, the better the story will be
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:21.640]   if you emerge on the other side.
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:24.200]   That to me feels like a motivating thing.
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.040]   So maybe if people are listening to this
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:29.480]   and they're going through some shit, as we said,
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:33.320]   one thing that could be a source of light
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:36.520]   is that it'll be a hell of a good story when it's all over,
[00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:38.280]   when you emerge on the other side.
[00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:41.480]   Let me ask you about decisions.
[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:43.080]   You've already talked about it a little bit,
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.480]   but when we face the world
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.320]   and we're making different decisions,
[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:52.200]   how much does our memory come into play?
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:55.280]   Is it the kind of narratives that we've constructed
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:58.320]   about the world that are used to make predictions
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:01.040]   that's fundamentally part of the decision-making?
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:02.080]   - Absolutely, yeah.
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.520]   So let's say after this,
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:05.960]   you and I decided we're gonna go for a beer, right?
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.480]   How do you choose where to go?
[00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:08.320]   You're probably gonna be like,
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:10.440]   "Oh yeah, this new bar opened up near me.
[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:11.940]   "I had a great time there.
[00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:13.480]   "They had a great beer selection."
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:15.600]   Or you might say, "Oh, we went to this place
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:16.960]   "and it was totally crowded
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:19.720]   "and they were playing this horrible EDM or whatever."
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:24.720]   And so right there, valuable source of information, right?
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.240]   And then you have these things
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.960]   like where you do this counterfactual stuff like,
[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:30.800]   "Well, I did this previously,
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.880]   "but what if I had gone somewhere else and said,
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:34.140]   "maybe I'll go to this other place
[00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:36.420]   "because I didn't try it the previous time."
[00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:39.960]   So there's all that kind of reasoning that goes into it too.
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:42.600]   I think even if you think about
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.600]   the big decisions in life, right?
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.240]   It's like you and I were talking
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:47.800]   before we started recording
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:52.400]   about how I got into memory research and you got into AI.
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:55.520]   And it's like we all have these personal reasons
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:57.640]   that guide us in these particular directions.
[00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:01.440]   And some of it's the environment and random factors in life,
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:05.960]   and some of it is memories of things that we wanna overcome
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:10.100]   or things that we build on in a positive way.
[00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:12.440]   But either way, they define us.
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:15.960]   - And probably the earlier in life the memories happen,
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:19.280]   the more defining power they have
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:21.700]   in terms of determining who we become.
[00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:25.160]   I mean, I do feel like adolescence is much more important
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.240]   than I think people give credit for.
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.840]   I think that there is this kind of a sense
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:31.480]   like the first three years of life
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:33.040]   is the most important part,
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:38.040]   but the teenage years are just so important for the brain.
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:41.360]   And so that's where a lot of mental illness
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.120]   starts to emerge.
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.000]   Now we're thinking of things like schizophrenia
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.280]   as a neurodevelopmental disorder
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:50.560]   because it just emerges during that period of adolescence
[00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:52.080]   and early adulthood.
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:54.760]   So, and I think the other part of it is,
[00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:57.900]   is that, I guess I was a little bit too firm
[00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:00.520]   in saying that memory determines who we are.
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:03.380]   It's really, the self is an evolving construct.
[00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:05.740]   I think we kind of underestimate that.
[00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:07.540]   And when you're a parent,
[00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:11.940]   you feel like every decision you make is consequential
[00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:15.220]   in forming this child and plays a role,
[00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:17.260]   but so do the child's peers.
[00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.220]   And so do, there's so much,
[00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:22.660]   I mean, that's why I think the big part of education,
[00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:24.420]   I think that's so important,
[00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:25.820]   is not the content you learn.
[00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:27.920]   I mean, think of how much dumb stuff
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:29.880]   we learned in school, right?
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:34.200]   But a lot of it is learning how to get along with people
[00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:38.260]   and learning who you are and how you function.
[00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:41.060]   And that can be terribly traumatizing
[00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:45.240]   even if you have perfect parents working on you.
[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:48.720]   - Is there some insight into the human brain
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:52.040]   that explains why we don't seem to remember anything
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.860]   from the first few years of life?
[00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:55.000]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.540]   In fact, actually, I was just talking
[00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:58.560]   to my really good friend and colleague,
[00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:01.220]   Simona Getty, who studies the neuroscience
[00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:04.060]   of child development, and so we were talking about this.
[00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:06.880]   And so there are a bunch of reasons, I would say.
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:10.600]   So one reason is there's an area of the brain
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.200]   called the hippocampus, which is very, very important
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:16.160]   for remembering events or episodic memory.
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.440]   And so the first two years of life,
[00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:21.400]   there's a period called infantile amnesia.
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:24.460]   And then the next couple years of life after that,
[00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:26.480]   there's a period called childhood amnesia.
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:29.680]   And the difference is that basically in the lab
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:33.360]   and even during childhood and afterwards,
[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:37.640]   children basically don't have any episodic memories
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:39.320]   for those first two years.
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:41.360]   The next two years, it's very fragmentary,
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:43.120]   and that's why they call it childhood amnesia.
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:44.640]   So there's some, but it's not much.
[00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:47.300]   So one reason is that the hippocampus
[00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:49.240]   is taking some time to develop,
[00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.240]   but another is the neocortex,
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:53.720]   so the whole folded stuff of gray matter
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.340]   all around the hippocampus,
[00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:59.560]   is developing so rapidly and changing,
[00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:01.400]   and a child's knowledge of the world
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:03.800]   is just massively being built up, right?
[00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:07.000]   So I'm gonna probably embarrass myself,
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.360]   but it's like if you showed like,
[00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:11.080]   you know, you trained a neural network
[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:12.800]   and you give it like the first couple of patterns
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:14.000]   or something like that,
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.600]   and then you bombard it with another,
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.880]   like, you know, years worth of data,
[00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:20.320]   try to get back those first couple of patterns, right?
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:22.400]   It's like everything changes.
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:25.120]   And so the brain is so plastic,
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:28.160]   the cortex is so plastic during that time,
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.520]   and we think that memories for events
[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:32.720]   are very distributed across the brain.
[00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:34.680]   So imagine you're trying to get back
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:36.520]   that pattern of activity that happened
[00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:38.120]   during this one moment,
[00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:40.240]   but the roads that you would take to get there
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:42.660]   have been completely rerouted, right?
[00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:45.260]   So I think that's my best explanation.
[00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.840]   - The third explanation is a child's sense of self
[00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:49.860]   takes a while to develop.
[00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:53.060]   And so their experience of learning
[00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:55.200]   might be more learning what happened
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:57.960]   as opposed to having this first-person experience
[00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:00.480]   of, "Ah, I remember I was there."
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:05.480]   - Well, I think somebody once said to me
[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:09.440]   that kind of loosely, philosophically,
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:11.320]   that the reason we don't remember
[00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:16.180]   the first few years of life, infantile amnesia,
[00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:18.540]   is because how traumatic it is.
[00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:21.660]   Basically, the error rate that you mentioned,
[00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:25.780]   when your brain's prediction doesn't match reality,
[00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:28.020]   the error rate in the first few years of life,
[00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:29.800]   your first few months, certainly,
[00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:31.380]   is probably crazy high.
[00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:34.500]   It's just nonstop freaking out.
[00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:37.400]   The collision between your model of the world
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:39.700]   and how the world works is just so high
[00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:42.640]   that you want whatever the trauma of that is
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.720]   not to linger around.
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:46.960]   I always thought that's an interesting idea
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:50.320]   because just imagine the insanity
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.020]   of what's happening in a human brain
[00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:53.600]   in the first couple years.
[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.160]   Just, you don't know anything.
[00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:58.080]   And there's just this string of knowledge
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.920]   and we're somehow, given how plastic everything is,
[00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:03.100]   it just kind of molds and figures it out.
[00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:08.100]   But it's like an insane waterfall of information.
[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:10.860]   I wouldn't necessarily describe it as a trauma.
[00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:12.860]   We can get into this whole stages of life thing,
[00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:14.760]   which I just love.
[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:16.940]   And basically, those first few years,
[00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:18.780]   there are, I mean, think about it,
[00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:23.100]   a kid's internal model of their body is changing.
[00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:25.140]   It's like just learning to move.
[00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:27.900]   I mean, if you ever have a baby,
[00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:29.740]   you'll know that the first three months,
[00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:31.540]   they're discovering their toes.
[00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:33.140]   It's just nuts.
[00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:34.880]   So everything is changing.
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:36.860]   But what's really fascinating is,
[00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:38.500]   and I think this is one of those,
[00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:40.540]   this is not at all me being a scientist,
[00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:42.420]   but it's like one of those things that people talk about
[00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:47.420]   when they talk about the positive aspects of children
[00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:49.900]   is that they're exceptionally curious
[00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:53.740]   and they have this kind of openness towards the world.
[00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:55.580]   And so that prediction error
[00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:58.680]   is not a negative traumatic thing, I think.
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:00.860]   It's like a very positive thing
[00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:04.300]   because it's what they use, they're seeking information.
[00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:06.300]   One of the areas that I'm very interested in
[00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:07.820]   is the prefrontal cortex.
[00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:09.860]   It's an area of the brain that,
[00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:11.580]   I mean, I could talk all day about it,
[00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:15.340]   but it helps us use our knowledge to say,
[00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:17.180]   "Hey, this is what I want to do now.
[00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:18.540]   "This is my goal.
[00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:20.820]   "So this is how I'm going to achieve it,"
[00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:24.100]   and focus everything towards that goal, right?
[00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:27.920]   The prefrontal cortex takes forever to develop in humans.
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:30.860]   The connections are still being tweaked and reformed
[00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:34.440]   like into late adolescence, early adulthood,
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:38.040]   which is when you tend to see mental illness pop up, right?
[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:40.800]   So it's being massively reformed.
[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:43.080]   Then you have about 10 years maybe
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:45.680]   of prime functioning of the prefrontal cortex,
[00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:47.480]   and then it starts going down again
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:48.840]   and you end up being older
[00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:51.500]   and you start losing all that frontal function.
[00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:53.740]   So I look at this and you'd say, okay,
[00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:56.320]   from you sit around episodic memory talks,
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:57.560]   we'll always say children are worse
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:59.320]   than adults at episodic memory.
[00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:01.880]   Older adults are worse than young adults at episodic memory.
[00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:04.920]   And I always would say, God, that's so weird.
[00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:07.040]   Why would we have this period of time
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:09.600]   that's so short when we're perfect, right?
[00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:10.440]   Or optimal.
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:12.480]   And I like to use that word optimal now
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:15.720]   because there's such a culture of optimization right now.
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:19.640]   And it's like, I realized I have to redefine what optimal is
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:23.660]   because for most of the human condition,
[00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:27.800]   I think we had a series of stages of life
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:31.280]   where you have basically adults saying, okay,
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:34.120]   young adults saying, I've got a child
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:35.800]   and I'm part of this village
[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:38.560]   and I have to hunt and forage and get things done.
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:40.940]   I need a prefrontal cortex so I can stay focused
[00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:43.780]   on the big picture and long haul goals.
[00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:47.120]   Now I'm a child, I'm in this village,
[00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:50.840]   I'm kind of wandering around and I've got some safety
[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:52.960]   and I need to learn about this culture
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.600]   because I know so little.
[00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:55.620]   What's the best way to do that?
[00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:56.560]   Let's explore.
[00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:59.000]   I don't wanna be constrained by goals as much.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.080]   I wanna really be free, play and explore and learn.
[00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:05.480]   So you don't want a super tight prefrontal cortex.
[00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:07.960]   You don't even know what the goals should be yet, right?
[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:10.600]   It's like, if you're trying to design a model
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:15.000]   that's based on a bad goal, it's not gonna work well, right?
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.480]   So then you go late in life and you say,
[00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:20.680]   oh, why don't you have a great prefrontal cortex then?
[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:23.400]   But I think, I mean, if you go back and you think
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:27.200]   how many species actually stick around naturally
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:29.800]   long after their childbearing years are over,
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.320]   after their reproductive years are over?
[00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:33.320]   Like menopause, from what I understand,
[00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:36.720]   menopause is not all that common in the animal world, right?
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.760]   So why would that happen?
[00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:43.120]   And so I saw Alison Gopnik said something about this
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:45.680]   so I started to look into this, about this idea
[00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:49.760]   that really when you're older in most societies,
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:53.640]   your job is no longer to form new episodic memories.
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:56.200]   It's to pass on the memories that you already have,
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:57.400]   this knowledge about the world,
[00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.200]   or what we call semantic memory,
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:02.520]   to pass on that semantic memory to the younger generations,
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:03.960]   to pass on the culture.
[00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:06.160]   You know, even now in indigenous cultures,
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:07.400]   that's the role of the elders.
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:10.240]   They're respected, they're not seen as, you know,
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:12.920]   people who are past it and losing it.
[00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:15.680]   And I thought that was a very poignant thing
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:19.160]   that memory is doing what it's supposed to
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:21.240]   throughout these stages of life.
[00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:23.840]   - So it is always optimal in a sense.
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:24.680]   - Yeah.
[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:26.400]   - It's just optimal for that stage of life.
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:28.880]   - Yeah, and for the ecology of the system.
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:30.600]   So you've got, so I looked into this
[00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:34.200]   and it's like another species that has menopause is orcas.
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:37.000]   Orca pods are led by the grandmothers, right?
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.720]   So not the young adults, not the parents or whatever,
[00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:41.080]   the grandmothers.
[00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:44.200]   And so they're the ones that pass on the traditions
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:47.480]   to the, I guess, the younger generation of orcas.
[00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:50.360]   And if you look from what little I understand,
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:53.640]   different orca pods have different traditions.
[00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:55.040]   They hunt for different things,
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:56.880]   they have different play traditions.
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:59.400]   And that's a culture, right?
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:02.720]   And so in social animals,
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:06.040]   evolution, I think, is designing brains
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:07.880]   that are really around, you know,
[00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:11.380]   it's obviously optimized for the individual,
[00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:13.160]   but also for kin.
[00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:15.880]   And I think that the kin are part of this,
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:18.800]   like when they're a part of this intense social group,
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:21.520]   the brain development should parallel
[00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:22.880]   the nature of the ecology.
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:25.200]   - Well, it's just fascinating to think
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:28.880]   of the individual orca or human
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:31.080]   throughout its life, in stages,
[00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:35.840]   doing a kind of optimal wisdom development.
[00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:38.720]   So in the early days, you don't even know what the goal is,
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:39.680]   and you figure out the goal,
[00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:41.280]   and you kind of optimize for that goal,
[00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:42.200]   and you pursue that goal,
[00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:44.520]   and then all the wisdom you collect through that,
[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:47.000]   then you share with the others in the system,
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.240]   with the other individuals.
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:50.960]   And as a collective, then you kind of converge
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:55.880]   towards greater wisdom throughout the generation.
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:58.560]   So in that sense, it's optimal.
[00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:01.240]   Us humans and orcas got something going on.
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:02.600]   It works. - Oh, yeah.
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:03.820]   Apex predators.
[00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:07.600]   - I just got a Megalodon tooth,
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:10.240]   speaking of apex predators. - Oh, man.
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:13.560]   - It's, just imagine the size of that thing.
[00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:19.520]   Anyway, how does the brain forget,
[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:22.080]   and how and why does it remember?
[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:24.520]   So maybe some of the mechanisms.
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:25.560]   You mentioned the hippocampus.
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:28.520]   What are the different components involved here?
[00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:30.440]   - So we can think about this on a number of levels.
[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:32.580]   Maybe I'll give you the simplest version first,
[00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:34.480]   which is, we tend to think of memories
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:37.580]   as these individual things, and we can just access them,
[00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:40.000]   maybe a little bit like photos on your phone
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.360]   or something like that.
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:43.360]   But in the brain, the way it works
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:46.120]   is you have this distributed pool of neurons,
[00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:49.320]   and the memories are kind of shared
[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:51.060]   across different pools of neurons.
[00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:53.720]   And so what you have is competition,
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:56.020]   where sometimes memories that overlap
[00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:58.480]   can be fighting against each other, right?
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:00.320]   So sometimes we forget
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:03.800]   because that competition just wipes things out.
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:04.900]   Sometimes we forget
[00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:07.160]   because there aren't the biological signals
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:11.040]   which we can get into that would promote long-term retention.
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:12.560]   And lots of times we forget
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:15.200]   because we can't find the cue
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:17.640]   that sends us back to the right memory.
[00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:20.360]   And we need the right cue to be able to activate it, right?
[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:23.600]   So for instance, in a neural network,
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:25.680]   there is no, you wouldn't go and you'd say,
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:27.200]   "This is the memory," right?
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:31.340]   It's like the whole ecosystem of memories
[00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:33.080]   is in the weights of the neural network.
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:35.520]   And in fact, you could extract entirely new memories
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:37.200]   depending on how you feed.
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.560]   - You have to have the right query, the right prompt
[00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:42.280]   to access that, whatever the part you're looking for.
[00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:44.320]   - That's exactly right, that's exactly right.
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:46.560]   And in humans, you have this more complex set
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:48.000]   of ways memory works.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.800]   There's, as I said, the knowledge
[00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:51.240]   or what you call semantic memory.
[00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:53.960]   And then there's these memories for specific events,
[00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:55.480]   which we call episodic memory.
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:58.680]   And so there's different pieces of the puzzle
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:01.280]   that require different kinds of cues.
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:03.120]   So that's a big part of it too,
[00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:06.180]   is just this kind of what we call retrieval failure.
[00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:07.440]   - You mentioned episodic memory,
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:08.840]   you mentioned semantic memory.
[00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:10.640]   What are the different separations here?
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:14.680]   What's working memory, short-term memory, long-term memory?
[00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:17.520]   What are the interesting categories of memory?
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:19.680]   - Yeah, and so memory researchers,
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:22.520]   we love to cut things up and say,
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:24.560]   is memory one thing or is it two things?
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:25.880]   Is it two things or is it three things?
[00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:29.820]   And so one of the things that, there's value in that,
[00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:32.040]   and especially experimental value
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:34.240]   in terms of being able to dissect things.
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:36.540]   In the real world, it's all connected.
[00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:38.760]   Speak to your question, working memory,
[00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:41.040]   it was a term that was coined by Alan Baddeley.
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:43.560]   It's basically thought to be this ability
[00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:46.680]   to keep information online in your mind
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:48.560]   right in front of you at a given time
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:51.220]   and to be able to control the flow of that information,
[00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:53.520]   to choose what information is relevant,
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:56.200]   to be able to manipulate it and so forth.
[00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:58.120]   And one of the things that Alan did
[00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:00.560]   that was quite brilliant was he said,
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:03.840]   there's this ability to kind of passively store information,
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:07.600]   see things in your mind's eye or hear your internal monologue
[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:12.160]   but we have that ability to keep information in mind.
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:13.920]   But then we also have this separate,
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:17.120]   what he called a central executive,
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:19.640]   which is identified a lot with the prefrontal cortex.
[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:24.180]   It's this ability to control the flow of information
[00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:27.680]   that's being kept active based on what it is you're doing.
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:30.280]   Now, a lot of my early work was basically saying
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:31.440]   that this working memory,
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:34.680]   which some memory researchers would call short-term memory,
[00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:38.120]   is not at all independent from long-term memory.
[00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:42.120]   That is that a lot of executive function requires learning
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:45.180]   and you have to have synaptic change for that to happen.
[00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:48.360]   But there's also transient forms of memory.
[00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:51.600]   So one of the things I've been getting into lately
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:56.600]   is the idea that we form internal models of events.
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:59.640]   The obvious one that I always use is birthday parties.
[00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:01.760]   So you go to a child's birthday party,
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:04.240]   once the cake comes out and they start,
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:05.720]   you just see a candle,
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:08.120]   you can predict the whole frame,
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:10.160]   set of events that happens later.
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:12.720]   And up till that point where the child blows out the candle,
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:16.240]   you have an internal model in your head of what's going on.
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:18.300]   And so if you follow people's eyes,
[00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:19.820]   it's not actually on what's happening.
[00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:22.160]   It's going where the action's about to happen,
[00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:24.200]   which is just fascinating, right?
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:25.480]   So you have this internal model
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:28.660]   and that's a kind of a working memory product.
[00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:30.820]   It's something that you're keeping online
[00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:33.720]   that's allowing you to interpret this world around you.
[00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:35.440]   Now to build that model though,
[00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:36.720]   you need to pull out stuff
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:39.480]   from your general knowledge of the world,
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:41.580]   which is what we call semantic memory.
[00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:44.260]   And then you'd want to be able to pull out memories
[00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:46.400]   for specific events that happened in the past,
[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:48.400]   which we call episodic memory.
[00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:51.880]   So in a way they're all connected,
[00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:54.520]   even though it's different.
[00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:56.100]   The things that we're focusing on
[00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:58.440]   and the way we organize information in the present,
[00:28:58.440 --> 00:28:59.800]   which is working memory,
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:01.600]   will play a big role in determining
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:03.520]   how we remember that information later,
[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:05.400]   which people typically call long-term memory.
[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:07.780]   - So if you have something like a birthday party
[00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:09.880]   and you've been to many before,
[00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:13.540]   you're gonna load that from disk into working memory,
[00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:16.660]   this model, and then you're mostly operating on the model.
[00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:21.660]   And if it's a new task, you don't have a model,
[00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:24.560]   so you're more in the data collection?
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:26.320]   - Yes, one of the fascinating things
[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:27.280]   that we've been studying,
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:30.160]   and we're not at all the first to do this.
[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:33.080]   Jeff Sachs was a big pioneer in this,
[00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:34.960]   and I've been working with many other people,
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:38.240]   Ken Norman, Leila Davaci at Columbia
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:40.440]   has done some interesting stuff with this,
[00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:44.520]   is this idea that we form these internal models
[00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:47.180]   at particular points of high prediction error,
[00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:50.560]   or points of, I believe also points of uncertainty,
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:54.080]   points of surprise or motivationally significant periods.
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:58.340]   And those points are when it's maximally optimal
[00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:00.480]   to encode an episodic memory.
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:01.440]   So I used to think,
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:04.480]   oh, well, we're just encoding episodic memories constantly,
[00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:06.160]   boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:08.300]   But think about how much redundancy there is
[00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:09.680]   in all that, right?
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:13.400]   It's just a lot of information that you don't need.
[00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:15.840]   But if you capture an episodic memory
[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:19.240]   at the point of maximum uncertainty
[00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:20.980]   for the singular experience, right?
[00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:23.280]   You're just, it's only gonna happen once.
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:25.600]   But if you capture it at the point of maximum uncertainty
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:27.480]   or maximum surprise,
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:30.440]   you have the most useful point in your experience
[00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:31.720]   that you've grabbed.
[00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:34.160]   And what we see is that the hippocampus
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:37.640]   and these other networks that are involved
[00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:40.520]   in generating these internal models of events,
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:43.680]   they show a heightened period of connectivity
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:46.720]   or correlated activity during those breaks
[00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:49.500]   between different events, which we call event boundaries.
[00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:51.280]   These are the points where you're like surprised
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:54.400]   or you cross from one room to another and so forth.
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:56.360]   And that communication is associated
[00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:58.300]   with a bump of activity in the hippocampus
[00:30:58.300 --> 00:30:59.360]   and better memory.
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:04.360]   And so if people have a very good internal model
[00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:06.560]   throughout that event,
[00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:09.200]   you don't need to do much memory processing,
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:10.720]   you're in a predictive mode, right?
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:13.340]   And so then at these event boundaries, you encode
[00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:14.560]   and then you retrieve and you're like,
[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:17.400]   okay, wait a minute, what's going on here?
[00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:19.960]   Branganath's now talking about orcas, what's going on?
[00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:22.240]   And maybe you have to go back and remember reading my book
[00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:24.300]   to pull out the episodic memory to make sense
[00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:26.600]   of whatever it is I'm babbling about, right?
[00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:29.140]   And so there's this beautiful dynamics
[00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:33.080]   that you can see in the brain of these different networks
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:35.760]   that are coming together and then de-affiliating
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:38.320]   at different points in time that are allowing you
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:39.480]   to go into these modes.
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:42.720]   And so to speak to your original question,
[00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:45.280]   to some extent when we're talking about semantic memory
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:47.400]   and episodic memory and working memory,
[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:49.600]   you can think about it as these processes
[00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:52.200]   that are unfolding as these networks kind of come together
[00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:53.820]   and pull apart.
[00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:57.080]   - Can memory be trained and improved?
[00:31:57.080 --> 00:32:01.120]   This beautiful connected system that you've described,
[00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:04.740]   what aspect of it is a mechanism
[00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:06.940]   that can be improved through training?
[00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:10.120]   - I think improvement, it depends on what your definition
[00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:11.000]   of optimal is.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.880]   So what I say in the book is that you don't wanna remember
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:18.400]   more, you wanna remember better, which means focusing
[00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:20.240]   on the things that are important.
[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:22.000]   And that's what our brains are designed to do.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.460]   So if you go back to the earliest quantitative studies
[00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:29.600]   of memory by Ebbinghaus, what you see is that he was trying
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:32.800]   so hard to memorize this arbitrary nonsense,
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:37.160]   and within a day he lost about 60% of that information.
[00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:40.080]   And he was basically using a very, very generous way
[00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:41.400]   of measuring it, right?
[00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:46.100]   So as far as we know, nobody has managed to violate
[00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:48.640]   those basics of having people forget
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:50.220]   most of their experiences.
[00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:52.240]   So if your expectation is that you should remember
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:54.560]   everything and that's what your optimal is,
[00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:57.240]   you're already off, because this is not what human brains
[00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:58.680]   are designed to do.
[00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:01.680]   On the other hand, what we see over and over again
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:05.260]   is that the brain does, basically, one of the cool things
[00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:08.340]   about the design of the brain is it's always less is more,
[00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:09.400]   less is more, right?
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:12.500]   It's like, I mean, I've seen estimates that the human brain
[00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:15.560]   uses something like 12 to 20 watts, you know, in a day.
[00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:18.960]   I mean, that's just nuts, the low power consumption, right?
[00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:22.820]   So it's all about reusing information and making the most
[00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:24.080]   of what we already have.
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:28.040]   And so that's why, basically, again,
[00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:31.900]   what you see biologically is, you know, neuromodulators,
[00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:33.640]   for instance, these chemicals in the brain,
[00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:37.440]   like norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin.
[00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:40.660]   These are chemicals that are released during moments
[00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:42.960]   that tend to be biologically significant,
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:46.560]   surprise, fear, stress, et cetera.
[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:51.560]   And so these chemicals promote lasting plasticity, right?
[00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:54.240]   Essentially, some mechanisms by which the brain can say,
[00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:57.000]   prioritize the information that you carry with you
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.280]   into the future.
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:00.520]   Attention is a big factor as well,
[00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:03.280]   our ability to focus our attention on what's important.
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:08.600]   And so there's different schools of thought
[00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:10.640]   on training attention, for instance.
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:13.760]   So one of my colleagues, Amishi Jha,
[00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:15.360]   she wrote a book called "Peak Mind"
[00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:17.560]   and talks about mindfulness as a method
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:21.080]   for improving attention and focus.
[00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:23.960]   So she works a lot with military, like Navy SEALs and stuff
[00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:28.560]   to do this kind of work with mindfulness meditation.
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:30.760]   Adam Ghazali, another one of my friends and colleagues,
[00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:34.460]   has work on kind of training through video games, actually,
[00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:36.160]   as a way of training attention.
[00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:39.720]   And so it's not clear to me, you know,
[00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:41.500]   one of the challenges, though, in training
[00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:44.920]   is you tend to overfit to the thing
[00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:46.560]   that you're trying to optimize, right?
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:50.600]   So you tend to, if I'm looking at a video game,
[00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:52.840]   I can definitely get better at paying attention
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:54.020]   in the context of the video game,
[00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:56.420]   but you transfer it to the outside world.
[00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:58.080]   That's very controversial.
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:00.760]   - The implication there is that attention
[00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:03.820]   is a fundamental component of remembering something,
[00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:05.360]   allocating attention to it,
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:09.080]   and then attention might be something that you could train,
[00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:11.040]   how you allocate attention
[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:13.600]   and how you hold attention on a thing.
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:16.720]   - I can say that, in fact, we do in certain ways, right?
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:20.220]   So if you are an expert in something,
[00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:21.840]   you are training attention.
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:25.520]   So we did this one study of expertise in the brain.
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:27.640]   And so people used to think,
[00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:29.520]   let's say if you're a bird expert or something, right,
[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:30.680]   people will go, like,
[00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:33.400]   if you get really into this world of birds,
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:35.220]   you start to see the differences
[00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:37.140]   in your visual cortex is tuned up,
[00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:39.400]   and it's all about plasticity of the visual cortex.
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:42.600]   And vision researchers love to say everything's visual,
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:45.400]   but it's like, we did this study of attention
[00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:48.740]   and working memory and expertise.
[00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:50.200]   And one of the things that surprised us
[00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:52.920]   were the biggest effects as people became experts
[00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:55.160]   in identifying these different kinds
[00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:57.880]   of just crazy objects that we made up.
[00:35:57.880 --> 00:35:59.440]   As they developed this expertise
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:00.480]   of being able to identify
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:02.200]   what made them different from each other
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:03.460]   and what made them unique,
[00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:05.960]   we were actually seeing massive increases in activity
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:07.720]   in the prefrontal cortex.
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:09.960]   And this fits with some of the studies of chess experts
[00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:12.120]   and so forth that it's not so much
[00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:14.980]   that you learn the patterns passively,
[00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:17.000]   you learn what to look for.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.200]   You learn what's important, what's not, right?
[00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:21.080]   And you can see this in any kind
[00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:23.520]   of expert professional athlete.
[00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:25.760]   They're looking three steps ahead
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:27.280]   of where they're supposed to be.
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:29.920]   So that's a kind of a training of attention.
[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:32.920]   And those are also what you'd call expert memory skills.
[00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:35.440]   So if you take the memory athletes,
[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:37.840]   I know that's something we're both interested in.
[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:40.540]   So these are people who train in these competitions
[00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:42.620]   and they'll memorize a deck of cards
[00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:45.220]   in a really short amount of time.
[00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:48.280]   There's a great memory athlete,
[00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:52.300]   her name I think is pronounced Yenia Wintersol,
[00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:55.400]   but she, so I think she's got like a giant Instagram
[00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:58.800]   following and so she had this YouTube video that went viral
[00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:02.260]   where she had memorized an entire Ikea catalog, right?
[00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:05.120]   And so how do people do this?
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:08.680]   By all accounts from people who become memory athletes,
[00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:11.540]   they weren't born with some extraordinary memory,
[00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:15.200]   but they practice strategies over and over and over again.
[00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:17.240]   The strategy that they use for memorizing
[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:20.120]   a particular thing, it can become automatic
[00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:22.960]   and you can just deploy it in an instant, right?
[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:24.960]   So again, it's not necessarily gonna,
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:28.400]   one strategy for learning the order of a deck of cards
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:30.820]   might not help you for something else that you need,
[00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:34.020]   like remembering your way around Austin, Texas,
[00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:37.880]   but it's gonna be these, whatever you're interested in,
[00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:39.400]   you can optimize for that.
[00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:43.000]   And that's just a natural by-product of expertise.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.440]   - There's certain hacks.
[00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:46.000]   There's something called the memory palace
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.840]   that I played with, I don't know if you're familiar
[00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:51.200]   with that whole technique, and it works.
[00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:52.360]   It's interesting.
[00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:55.080]   So another thing I recommend for people a lot
[00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:58.240]   is I use Anki a lot every day.
[00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:01.640]   It's a app that does spaced repetition.
[00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:04.120]   So I think medical students and students use this a lot
[00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:05.600]   to remember a lot of different things.
[00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:07.800]   - Oh yeah, okay, we can come back to this, but yeah, go on.
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:09.920]   - Sure, it's the whole concept of spaced repetition.
[00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:13.340]   You just, when the thing is fresh,
[00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:15.880]   you kind of have to remind yourself of it a lot
[00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:20.880]   and then over time, you can wait a week, a month, a year
[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:23.840]   before you have to recall the thing again.
[00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:26.120]   And that way, you essentially have something
[00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:29.720]   like note cards that you can have tens of thousands of
[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:31.440]   and can only spend 30 minutes a day
[00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:34.720]   and actually be refreshing all of that information,
[00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:35.800]   all of that knowledge.
[00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:36.640]   It's really great.
[00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:40.040]   And then for memory palace is a technique
[00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:43.400]   that allows you to remember things like the Ikea catalog
[00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:47.080]   or by placing them visually in a place
[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:48.320]   that you're really familiar with.
[00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:49.920]   Like I'm really familiar with this place,
[00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:54.560]   so I can put numbers or facts
[00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:55.680]   or whatever you wanna remember.
[00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:58.840]   You can walk along that little palace and it reminds you.
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:38:59.680]   It's cool.
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:03.600]   Like there's stuff like that that I think athletes,
[00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:05.080]   memory athletes could use,
[00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:07.120]   but I think also regular people can use.
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:09.440]   One of the things I have to solve for myself
[00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:10.920]   is how to remember names.
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:13.140]   I'm horrible at it.
[00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:15.800]   I think it's because when people introduce themselves,
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:21.400]   I have the social anxiety of the interaction
[00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:24.300]   where I'm like, I know I should be remembering that,
[00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:26.480]   but I'm freaking out internally
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:30.200]   about social interaction in general.
[00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:32.440]   And so therefore, I forget immediately.
[00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:34.520]   So I'm looking for good tricks for that.
[00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:39.040]   - So I feel like we've got a lot in common
[00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:41.760]   because when people introduce themselves to me,
[00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:45.860]   it's almost like I have this just blank blackout
[00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:48.100]   for a moment and then I'm just looking at them like,
[00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:49.060]   what happened?
[00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:51.820]   I look away or something, what's wrong with me?
[00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:54.060]   So, I mean, I'm totally with you on this.
[00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:57.280]   The reason why it's hard is that there's no reason
[00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:59.940]   we should be able to remember names
[00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:01.700]   because when you say remembering a name,
[00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:03.100]   you're not really remembering a name.
[00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:04.100]   Maybe in my case you are,
[00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:06.260]   but most of the time you're associating a name
[00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:09.140]   with a face and an identity.
[00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:11.920]   And that's a completely arbitrary thing, right?
[00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:14.560]   I mean, maybe in the olden days, somebody named Miller,
[00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:16.040]   it's like they're actually making flour
[00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:19.360]   or something like that, but for the most part,
[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:22.400]   it's like these names are just utterly arbitrary.
[00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:25.280]   So you have no thing to latch onto.
[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:28.720]   And so it's not really a thing that our brain does very well
[00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:31.160]   is to learn meaningless, arbitrary stuff.
[00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:35.360]   So what you need to do is build connections somehow,
[00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:36.800]   visualize a connection.
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:40.880]   And sometimes it's obvious or sometimes it's not.
[00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:43.000]   I'm trying to think of a good one for you now,
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.240]   but the first thing I think of is Lex Luthor, but-
[00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:46.080]   - That's great.
[00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:46.920]   - Yeah, so you think of Lex Luthor.
[00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:50.160]   - Doesn't Lex Luthor wear a suit, I think?
[00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:53.460]   - I know he has a shaved head though, or he's bald,
[00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:54.920]   which you're not, you've got a great head
[00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:56.640]   if I trade hair with you any day.
[00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:58.880]   But like, you know, something like that.
[00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:01.280]   But if I can come up with something, like I could say,
[00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:04.160]   okay, so Lex Luthor is this criminal mastermind
[00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:05.000]   and then I just imagine you-
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.240]   - And we talked about stabbing or whatever earlier.
[00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:08.080]   - Yeah, exactly, right.
[00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:09.680]   - So I'm just kind of connected and that's it.
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:12.040]   - Yeah, yeah, but I'm serious though
[00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:14.260]   that these kinds of weird associations,
[00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:16.120]   now I'm building a richer network.
[00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:19.080]   I mean, one of the things that I find is if I've,
[00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:20.740]   like you can have somebody's name
[00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:23.720]   that's just totally generic, like John Smith or something,
[00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:26.120]   not that, no offense to people, that name,
[00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:29.680]   but you know, if I see a generic name like that,
[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:32.960]   but I've read John Smith's papers academically
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:35.480]   and then I meet John Smith at a conference,
[00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:38.000]   I can immediately associate that name with that face
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.840]   'cause I have this preexisting network
[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:41.960]   to lock everything into, right?
[00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:43.520]   And so you can build that network
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:45.400]   and that's what the method of loci
[00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:47.920]   or the memory palace technique is all about
[00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:50.420]   is you have a preexisting structure in your head
[00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:54.200]   of like your childhood home or this mental palace
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:55.960]   that you've created for yourself.
[00:41:55.960 --> 00:42:00.200]   And so now you can put arbitrary pieces of information
[00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:04.580]   in different locations in that mental structure of yours
[00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:07.520]   and then you could walk through the different path
[00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:10.640]   and find all the pieces of information you're looking for.
[00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:12.680]   So the method of loci is a great method
[00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:15.100]   for just learning arbitrary things
[00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:17.540]   because it allows you to link them together
[00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:20.800]   and get that cue that you need to pop in
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:22.420]   and find everything, right?
[00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:27.120]   - We should maybe linger on this memory palace thing
[00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:30.040]   just to make obvious 'cause when people were describing
[00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:34.080]   to me a while ago what this is, it seems insane.
[00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:40.000]   You literally think of a place like a childhood home
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.160]   or a home that you're really visually familiar with
[00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:50.880]   and you literally place in that three-dimensional space
[00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:54.680]   facts or people or whatever you wanna remember
[00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:59.680]   and you just walk in your mind along that place visually
[00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:02.580]   and you can remember,
[00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:04.480]   remind yourself of the different things.
[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:07.600]   One of the limitations is there is a sequence to it.
[00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:10.040]   So it's, I think your brain somehow,
[00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:12.680]   you can't just like go upstairs right away or something.
[00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:15.000]   You have to like walk along the room.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.880]   So it's really great for remembering sequences
[00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:19.000]   but it's also not great for remembering
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.760]   like individual facts out of context.
[00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:23.760]   So the full context of the tour I think is important.
[00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:28.240]   But it's fascinating how the mind is able to do that
[00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:30.720]   when you ground these pieces of knowledge
[00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:34.880]   into something that you remember well already,
[00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:36.360]   especially visually.
[00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:37.200]   Fascinating.
[00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:39.320]   And you can just do that for any kind of sequence.
[00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:43.160]   I'm sure she used something like this for IKEA catalog.
[00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:45.880]   - Oh yeah, absolutely, absolutely.
[00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:49.280]   And I think the principle here is,
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:50.640]   again, I was telling you this idea
[00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:53.320]   that memories can compete with each other, right?
[00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:56.100]   Well, I like to use this example
[00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:57.520]   and maybe someday I'll regret this
[00:43:57.520 --> 00:43:59.920]   but I've used it a lot recently is like,
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:01.560]   imagine if this were my desk,
[00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:03.800]   it could be cluttered with a zillion different things, right?
[00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:04.880]   So imagine it's just cluttered
[00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:07.080]   with a whole bunch of yellow post-it notes.
[00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:09.980]   And one of them, I put my bank password on it, right?
[00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:11.680]   Well, it's gonna take me forever to find it.
[00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:13.720]   I might, you know, it's just gonna be buried
[00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:15.360]   under all these other post-it notes.
[00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:18.560]   But if it's like hot pink, it's gonna stand out
[00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:19.960]   and I find it really easily, right?
[00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:23.600]   And so that's one way in which if things are distinctive,
[00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:27.320]   if you've processed information in a very distinctive way,
[00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:31.400]   then you can have a memory that's gonna last.
[00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:33.120]   And that's very good, for instance,
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:34.880]   for name-face associations.
[00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:37.200]   If I get something distinctive about you,
[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:39.920]   you know, that it's like, that you've got very short hair
[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:41.280]   and maybe I can make the association
[00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:43.560]   with Lex Luthor that way or something like that, right?
[00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:45.620]   You know, but I get something very specific.
[00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:47.120]   That's a great cue.
[00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:48.400]   But the other part of it is,
[00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:50.840]   what if I just organized my notes
[00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:53.080]   so that I have my finances in one pile
[00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:57.000]   and I have my like reminders, my to-do list in one pile?
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:58.880]   And so forth, so I organize them.
[00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:02.160]   Well, then I know exactly if I'm going for my banking,
[00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:03.800]   you know, my bank password,
[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:06.040]   I could go to the finance pile, right?
[00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:10.080]   So the method of loci works or memory palaces work
[00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:12.180]   because they give you a way of organizing.
[00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:14.640]   There's a school of thought that says
[00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:17.440]   that episodic memory evolved
[00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:19.720]   from this like kind of knowledge of space
[00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:22.800]   and, you know, basically this primitive abilities
[00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:24.000]   to figure out where you are.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.920]   And so people explain the method of loci that way.
[00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:29.160]   And, you know, whether or not
[00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:31.640]   the evolutionary argument is true,
[00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:33.400]   the method of loci is not at all special.
[00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:35.560]   So if you're not a good visualizer,
[00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:37.840]   stories are a good one.
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:41.240]   So a lot of memory athletes will use stories
[00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:44.480]   and they'll go like, if you're memorizing a deck of cards,
[00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:46.480]   they have a little code for the different,
[00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:50.520]   like the king and the jack and the 10 and so forth.
[00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:53.080]   And they'll make up a story about things that they're doing
[00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:54.040]   and that'll work.
[00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:56.080]   Songs are a great one, right?
[00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:58.240]   I mean, it's like, I can still remember
[00:45:58.240 --> 00:46:01.080]   there was this obscure episode of the TV show "Cheers."
[00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:02.640]   They sing a song about Albania
[00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:05.800]   that he uses to memorize all these facts about Albania.
[00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:08.160]   I could still sing that song to you.
[00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:12.160]   It's just, I saw it on a TV show, you know?
[00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:13.800]   - So you mentioned space repetition.
[00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:16.120]   So what, do you like this process?
[00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:17.520]   Maybe can you explain it?
[00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:18.360]   - Oh yeah.
[00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:19.880]   If I'm trying to memorize something,
[00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:22.160]   let's say if I have an hour to memorize
[00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:24.500]   as many Spanish words as I can,
[00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:27.400]   if I just try to do like half an hour
[00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:30.160]   and then later in the day I do half an hour,
[00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:32.680]   I won't retain that information as long
[00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:34.680]   as if I do half an hour today
[00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:37.120]   and half an hour one week from now.
[00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:40.040]   And so doing that extra spacing
[00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:42.800]   should help me retain the information better.
[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:45.920]   Now there's an interesting boundary condition,
[00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:49.360]   which is it depends on when you need that information.
[00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:51.480]   So many of us, you know, for me,
[00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:54.580]   like I can't remember so much from college and high school
[00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:55.420]   'cause I crammed,
[00:46:55.420 --> 00:46:57.580]   'cause I just did everything at the last minute.
[00:46:57.580 --> 00:47:01.240]   And sometimes I would literally study like, you know,
[00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:03.620]   in the hallway right before the test.
[00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:06.300]   And that was great because what would happen is,
[00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:08.900]   is I just had that information right there.
[00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:12.460]   And so actually not spacing can really help you
[00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:14.900]   if you need it very quickly, right?
[00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:15.780]   But the problem is,
[00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:18.260]   is that you tend to forget it later on.
[00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:20.860]   But on the other hand, if you space things out,
[00:47:20.860 --> 00:47:23.860]   you get a benefit for later on retention.
[00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:27.080]   And so there's many different explanations.
[00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:29.060]   We have a computational model of this.
[00:47:29.060 --> 00:47:31.420]   It's currently under revision.
[00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:32.820]   But in our computer model,
[00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:35.140]   what we say is, is that an easy,
[00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:37.820]   maybe a good way of thinking about this is
[00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:40.660]   this conversation that you and I are having,
[00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:43.100]   it's associated with a particular context,
[00:47:43.100 --> 00:47:45.140]   a particular place in time.
[00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:47.740]   And so all of these little cues that are in the background,
[00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:49.980]   these little guitar sculptures that you have
[00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:52.180]   and that big light umbrella thing, right?
[00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:53.820]   All these things are part of my memory
[00:47:53.820 --> 00:47:56.380]   for what we're talking about, the content.
[00:47:56.380 --> 00:48:00.140]   So now later on, you're sitting around
[00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:02.620]   and you're at home drinking a beer and you're thinking,
[00:48:02.620 --> 00:48:04.820]   God, what a strange interview that was, right?
[00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:06.940]   So now you're trying to remember it,
[00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:08.780]   but the context is different.
[00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:12.980]   So your current situation doesn't match up
[00:48:12.980 --> 00:48:14.740]   with the memory that you pulled up.
[00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:15.600]   There's error.
[00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:18.320]   There's a mismatch between what you pulled up
[00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:20.020]   and your current context.
[00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:21.860]   And so in our model, what you start to do
[00:48:21.860 --> 00:48:25.820]   is you start to erase or alter the parts of the memory
[00:48:25.820 --> 00:48:28.740]   that are associated with a specific place in time,
[00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:32.100]   and you heighten the information about the content.
[00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:34.940]   And so if you remember this information
[00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:37.460]   in different times and different places,
[00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:41.060]   it's more accessible at different times and different places
[00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:42.980]   because it's not overfitted
[00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:45.660]   in an AI kind of way of thinking about things.
[00:48:45.660 --> 00:48:47.940]   It's not overfitted to one particular context.
[00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:51.660]   But that's also why the memories that we call upon the most
[00:48:51.660 --> 00:48:53.860]   also feel kind of like they're just things
[00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:54.900]   that we read about almost.
[00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:57.180]   You don't vividly re-imagine them, right?
[00:48:57.180 --> 00:48:58.680]   It's like they're just these things
[00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:01.340]   that just come to us like facts, right?
[00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:03.820]   And it's a little bit different than semantic memory,
[00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:05.860]   but it's like basically these events
[00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:10.140]   that we have recalled over and over and over again,
[00:49:10.140 --> 00:49:11.860]   we keep updating that memory
[00:49:11.860 --> 00:49:15.020]   so it's less and less tied to the original experience.
[00:49:15.020 --> 00:49:16.300]   But then we have those other ones,
[00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:18.020]   which it's like you just get a reminder
[00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:20.060]   of that very specific context.
[00:49:20.060 --> 00:49:22.700]   You smell something, you hear a song,
[00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:25.540]   you see a place that you haven't been to in a while,
[00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:27.580]   and boom, it just comes back to you.
[00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:28.900]   And that's the exact opposite
[00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:30.340]   of what you get with spacing, right?
[00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:31.300]   - That's so fascinating.
[00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:34.300]   So with space repetition, one of its powers
[00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:37.160]   is that you lose attachment to a particular context,
[00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:42.740]   but then it loses the intensity
[00:49:42.740 --> 00:49:44.980]   of the flavor of the memory.
[00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:47.460]   That's interesting, that's so interesting.
[00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:50.180]   - Yeah, but at the same time, it becomes stronger
[00:49:50.180 --> 00:49:52.340]   in the sense that the content becomes stronger.
[00:49:52.340 --> 00:49:54.860]   - Yeah, so it's used for learning languages,
[00:49:54.860 --> 00:49:57.100]   for learning facts, for learning,
[00:49:57.100 --> 00:49:59.940]   for that generic semantic information type of memory.
[00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:02.740]   - Yeah, and I think this falls into a category.
[00:50:02.740 --> 00:50:04.700]   We've done other modeling.
[00:50:04.700 --> 00:50:06.020]   One of these is a published study
[00:50:06.020 --> 00:50:08.200]   in PLOS Computational Biology,
[00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:11.260]   where we showed that another way,
[00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:14.700]   which is, I think, related to the spacing effect,
[00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:16.220]   is what's called the testing effect.
[00:50:16.220 --> 00:50:20.620]   So the idea is that if you're trying to learn words,
[00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:22.500]   let's say in Spanish or something like that,
[00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:25.140]   and this doesn't have to be words, it could be anything,
[00:50:25.140 --> 00:50:27.540]   you test yourself on the words,
[00:50:27.540 --> 00:50:29.460]   and that act of testing yourself
[00:50:29.460 --> 00:50:31.780]   helps you retain it better over time
[00:50:31.780 --> 00:50:33.840]   than if you just studied it, right?
[00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:37.860]   And so from traditional learning theories,
[00:50:37.860 --> 00:50:40.020]   some learning theories anyway, this seems weird,
[00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:44.020]   why would you do better giving yourself this extra error
[00:50:44.020 --> 00:50:45.340]   from testing yourself,
[00:50:45.340 --> 00:50:48.540]   rather than just giving yourself perfect input
[00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:51.860]   that's a replica of what it is that you're trying to learn?
[00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:55.260]   And I think the reason is is that you get better retention
[00:50:55.260 --> 00:50:58.700]   from that error, that mismatch that we talked about, right?
[00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:00.860]   So what's happening in our model,
[00:51:00.860 --> 00:51:03.060]   it's actually conceptually kind of similar
[00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:07.460]   to what happens with backprop in AI or neural networks.
[00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:10.020]   And so the idea is that you expose,
[00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:13.660]   here's the bad connections and here's the good connections.
[00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:17.340]   And so we can keep the parts of this cell assembly
[00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:18.500]   that are good for the memory
[00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:20.860]   and lose the ones that are not so good.
[00:51:20.860 --> 00:51:22.700]   But if you don't stress test the memory,
[00:51:22.700 --> 00:51:25.660]   you haven't exposed it to the error fully.
[00:51:25.660 --> 00:51:28.020]   And so that's why I think this is kind of,
[00:51:28.020 --> 00:51:30.200]   this is a thing that I come back to over and over again,
[00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:34.200]   is that you will retain information better
[00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:37.980]   if you're constantly pushing yourself to your limit, right?
[00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:41.420]   If you are feeling like you're coasting,
[00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:44.020]   then you're actually not learning.
[00:51:44.020 --> 00:51:45.020]   So it's like-
[00:51:45.020 --> 00:51:50.020]   - So you should always be stress testing the memory system.
[00:51:50.020 --> 00:51:52.020]   - Yeah, and feel good about it.
[00:51:52.020 --> 00:51:55.280]   Even though everyone tells me, oh, my memory's terrible,
[00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:57.140]   in the moment, they're overconfident
[00:51:57.140 --> 00:51:59.340]   about what they'll retain later on.
[00:51:59.340 --> 00:52:01.020]   So it's fascinating.
[00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:03.800]   And so what happens is when you test yourself,
[00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:06.740]   you're like, oh my God, I thought I knew that, but I don't.
[00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:11.500]   And so it can be demoralizing until you get around that
[00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:14.020]   and you realize, hey, this is the way that I learned.
[00:52:14.020 --> 00:52:16.660]   This is how I learned best.
[00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:20.580]   It's like if you're trying to star in a movie
[00:52:20.580 --> 00:52:21.460]   or something like that,
[00:52:21.460 --> 00:52:23.400]   you don't just sit around reading the script.
[00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:24.700]   You actually act it out.
[00:52:24.700 --> 00:52:27.340]   And you're gonna botch those lines from time to time, right?
[00:52:27.340 --> 00:52:28.580]   - You know, there's an interesting moment
[00:52:28.580 --> 00:52:29.780]   you probably experienced this.
[00:52:29.780 --> 00:52:32.900]   I remember a good friend of mine, Joe Rogan,
[00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:34.900]   I was on his podcast.
[00:52:34.900 --> 00:52:39.900]   And we were randomly talking about soccer, football.
[00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:45.760]   Somebody I grew up watching, Diego Armando Maradona,
[00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:47.940]   one of the greatest soccer players of all time.
[00:52:47.940 --> 00:52:52.200]   And we were talking about him and his career and so on.
[00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:57.040]   And Joe asked me if he's still around.
[00:52:57.040 --> 00:53:00.700]   Now, and I said, yeah.
[00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:06.200]   I don't know why I thought yeah,
[00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:08.860]   because that was a perfect example of memories.
[00:53:08.860 --> 00:53:10.320]   He passed away.
[00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:14.300]   I tweeted about it, how heartbroken I was,
[00:53:14.300 --> 00:53:17.060]   all this kind of stuff, like a year before.
[00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:19.520]   I know this, but in my mind,
[00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:22.740]   I went back to the thing I've done many times in my head,
[00:53:22.740 --> 00:53:26.420]   visualizing some of the epic runs he had on goal and so on.
[00:53:26.420 --> 00:53:28.100]   So for me, he's alive.
[00:53:28.100 --> 00:53:30.740]   And so I'm, and part of the, also the conversation
[00:53:30.740 --> 00:53:33.300]   when you're talking to Joe, you're just stressing.
[00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:34.860]   The focus is allocated,
[00:53:34.860 --> 00:53:37.700]   the attention is allocated in a particular way.
[00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:40.620]   But when I walked away, I was like,
[00:53:40.620 --> 00:53:44.660]   in which world was Diego Maradona still alive?
[00:53:44.660 --> 00:53:47.500]   Like in which, 'cause I was sure in my head
[00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:49.100]   that he was still alive.
[00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:51.700]   There was a, it's a moment that sticks with me.
[00:53:51.700 --> 00:53:53.620]   I've had a few like that in my life,
[00:53:53.620 --> 00:53:58.300]   where it just kinda, like obvious things
[00:53:58.300 --> 00:53:59.980]   just disappear from mind.
[00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:02.580]   And it's cool, like it shows actually the power
[00:54:02.580 --> 00:54:04.500]   of the mind in a positive sense
[00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:07.220]   to erase memories you want erased, maybe.
[00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:09.280]   But I don't know.
[00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:10.980]   I don't know if there's a good explanation for that.
[00:54:10.980 --> 00:54:13.980]   - One of the cool things that I found is this,
[00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:18.420]   that some people really just revolutionize a field
[00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:22.140]   by creating a problem that didn't exist before.
[00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:24.500]   It's kinda like why I love science is like,
[00:54:24.500 --> 00:54:27.180]   engineering is like solving other people's problems,
[00:54:27.180 --> 00:54:29.620]   and science is about creating problems.
[00:54:29.620 --> 00:54:31.860]   I'm just much more like I wanna break things
[00:54:31.860 --> 00:54:34.340]   and create problems.
[00:54:34.340 --> 00:54:36.040]   Not necessarily move fast though.
[00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:36.980]   (laughing)
[00:54:36.980 --> 00:54:39.540]   But one of my former mentors, Marsha Johnson,
[00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:40.940]   who in my opinion is one of the greatest
[00:54:40.940 --> 00:54:42.880]   memory researchers of all time.
[00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:45.300]   She comes up, young woman in the field,
[00:54:45.300 --> 00:54:47.380]   and it's mostly guy field.
[00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:51.460]   And she gets into this idea of how do we tell the difference
[00:54:51.460 --> 00:54:53.220]   between things that we've imagined
[00:54:53.220 --> 00:54:55.140]   and things that we actually remember?
[00:54:55.140 --> 00:54:57.420]   How do we tell, I get some mental experience.
[00:54:57.420 --> 00:55:00.180]   Where did that mental experience come from, right?
[00:55:00.180 --> 00:55:02.980]   And it turns out this is a huge problem
[00:55:02.980 --> 00:55:04.900]   because essentially our mental experience
[00:55:04.900 --> 00:55:06.900]   of remembering something that happened,
[00:55:06.900 --> 00:55:10.180]   our mental experience of thinking about something,
[00:55:10.180 --> 00:55:11.340]   how do you tell the difference?
[00:55:11.340 --> 00:55:15.380]   They're both largely constructions in our head.
[00:55:15.380 --> 00:55:18.260]   And so it is very important.
[00:55:18.260 --> 00:55:22.720]   And the way that you do it is, I mean it's not perfect,
[00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:25.420]   but the way that we often do it and succeed
[00:55:25.420 --> 00:55:27.620]   is by again using our prefrontal cortex
[00:55:27.620 --> 00:55:31.680]   and really focusing on the sensory information
[00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:34.700]   or the place and time and the things that put us back
[00:55:34.700 --> 00:55:37.500]   into when this information happened.
[00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:39.200]   And if it's something you thought about,
[00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:41.740]   you're not gonna have all of that vivid detail
[00:55:41.740 --> 00:55:44.380]   as you do for something that actually happened.
[00:55:44.380 --> 00:55:45.740]   But it doesn't work all the time.
[00:55:45.740 --> 00:55:47.420]   But that's a big thing that you have to do.
[00:55:47.420 --> 00:55:51.260]   But it takes time, it's slow, and it's again, effortful.
[00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:53.700]   But that's what you need to remember accurately.
[00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:55.800]   But what's cool, and I think this is what you alluded to
[00:55:55.800 --> 00:55:57.840]   about how that was an interesting experience,
[00:55:57.840 --> 00:56:00.420]   is imagination's exactly the opposite.
[00:56:00.420 --> 00:56:03.100]   Imagination is basically saying,
[00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:06.300]   I'm just gonna take all this information from memory,
[00:56:06.300 --> 00:56:09.220]   recombine it in different ways and throw it out there.
[00:56:09.220 --> 00:56:13.060]   And so for instance, Dan Schachter and Donna Addis
[00:56:13.060 --> 00:56:14.360]   have done cool work on this.
[00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:16.520]   Demis Hassabis did work on this
[00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:19.400]   with Eleanor McGuire in UCL.
[00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:23.220]   And this goes back actually to this guy, Frederick Bartlett,
[00:56:23.220 --> 00:56:25.760]   who was this revolutionary memory researcher.
[00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:29.360]   Bartlett, he actually rejected the whole idea
[00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:30.560]   of quantifying memory.
[00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:32.760]   He said, "There's no statistics in my book."
[00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:35.480]   He came from this anthropology perspective.
[00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:38.080]   And short version of the stories,
[00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:40.080]   he just asked people to recall things.
[00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:42.200]   He would give people stories and poems,
[00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:43.840]   ask people to recall them.
[00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:45.760]   And what he found was people's memories
[00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:48.100]   didn't reflect all of the details
[00:56:48.100 --> 00:56:50.160]   of what they were exposed to.
[00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:52.160]   And they did reflect a lot more,
[00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:55.120]   they were filtered through this lens of prior knowledge.
[00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:57.480]   The cultures that they came from,
[00:56:57.480 --> 00:57:00.160]   the beliefs that they had, the things they knew.
[00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:01.880]   And so what he concluded was that
[00:57:01.880 --> 00:57:05.760]   he called remembering an imaginative construction.
[00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:09.080]   Meaning that we don't replay the past,
[00:57:09.080 --> 00:57:11.220]   we imagine how the past could have been
[00:57:11.220 --> 00:57:14.400]   by taking bits and pieces that come up in our heads.
[00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:17.460]   And likewise, he wrote this beautiful paper on imagination
[00:57:17.460 --> 00:57:20.340]   saying when we imagine something and create something,
[00:57:20.340 --> 00:57:23.060]   we're creating it from these specific experiences
[00:57:23.060 --> 00:57:25.660]   that we've had and combining it with our general knowledge.
[00:57:25.660 --> 00:57:28.380]   But instead of trying to focus it on being accurate
[00:57:28.380 --> 00:57:29.760]   and getting at one thing,
[00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:31.960]   you're just ruthlessly recombining things
[00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:36.960]   without any necessary kind of goal in mind.
[00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:39.380]   I mean, or at least that's one kind of creation.
[00:57:39.380 --> 00:57:44.380]   - So imagination is fundamentally coupled with memory
[00:57:44.380 --> 00:57:48.300]   in both directions?
[00:57:48.300 --> 00:57:49.140]   - I think so.
[00:57:49.140 --> 00:57:52.580]   I mean, it's not clear that it is in everyone,
[00:57:52.580 --> 00:57:54.500]   but one of the things that's been studied
[00:57:54.500 --> 00:57:56.860]   is some patients who have amnesia, for instance,
[00:57:56.860 --> 00:58:00.360]   they have brain damage, say, to the hippocampus.
[00:58:00.360 --> 00:58:03.620]   And if you ask them to imagine things
[00:58:03.620 --> 00:58:04.780]   that are not in front of them,
[00:58:04.780 --> 00:58:06.220]   like imagine what could happen
[00:58:06.220 --> 00:58:08.420]   after I leave this room, right?
[00:58:08.420 --> 00:58:11.700]   They find it very difficult to give you a scenario
[00:58:11.700 --> 00:58:13.020]   of what could happen.
[00:58:13.020 --> 00:58:14.820]   Or if they do, it'd be more stereotyped,
[00:58:14.820 --> 00:58:16.460]   like yes, this would happen, this would.
[00:58:16.460 --> 00:58:18.220]   But it's not like they can come up with anything
[00:58:18.220 --> 00:58:21.340]   that's very vivid and creative in that sense.
[00:58:21.340 --> 00:58:23.140]   And it's partly 'cause when you have amnesia,
[00:58:23.140 --> 00:58:25.200]   you're stuck in the present.
[00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:28.340]   Because to get a very good model of the future,
[00:58:28.340 --> 00:58:32.020]   it really helps to have episodic memories to draw upon.
[00:58:32.020 --> 00:58:35.100]   And so that's the basic idea.
[00:58:35.100 --> 00:58:38.020]   And in fact, one of the most impressive things,
[00:58:38.020 --> 00:58:40.580]   when people started to scan people's brains
[00:58:40.580 --> 00:58:43.980]   and ask people to remember past events,
[00:58:43.980 --> 00:58:46.260]   what they found was there was this big network of the brain
[00:58:46.260 --> 00:58:47.900]   called the default mode network.
[00:58:47.900 --> 00:58:49.140]   It gets a lot of press
[00:58:49.140 --> 00:58:50.780]   because it's thought to be important.
[00:58:50.780 --> 00:58:52.740]   It's engaged during mind-wandering.
[00:58:52.740 --> 00:58:55.420]   And if I ask you to pay attention to something,
[00:58:55.420 --> 00:58:58.020]   it only comes on when you stop paying attention.
[00:58:58.020 --> 00:59:02.540]   So people, oh, it's just this kind of daydreaming network.
[00:59:02.540 --> 00:59:04.420]   And I thought, this is just ridiculous research.
[00:59:04.420 --> 00:59:05.260]   Who cares?
[00:59:06.260 --> 00:59:07.740]   But then what people found
[00:59:07.740 --> 00:59:10.100]   was when people recall episodic memories,
[00:59:10.100 --> 00:59:11.940]   this network gets active.
[00:59:11.940 --> 00:59:15.140]   And so we started to look into it,
[00:59:15.140 --> 00:59:18.540]   and this network of areas is really closely,
[00:59:18.540 --> 00:59:21.300]   functionally interacting with the hippocampus.
[00:59:21.300 --> 00:59:23.820]   And so, in fact, some would say the hippocampus
[00:59:23.820 --> 00:59:26.220]   is part of this default network.
[00:59:26.220 --> 00:59:29.680]   And if you look at brain images of people,
[00:59:29.680 --> 00:59:31.580]   or brain maps of activation, so to speak,
[00:59:31.580 --> 00:59:34.220]   of people imagining possible scenarios
[00:59:34.220 --> 00:59:36.140]   of things that could happen in the future,
[00:59:36.140 --> 00:59:39.500]   even things that couldn't really be very plausible,
[00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:41.020]   they look very similar.
[00:59:41.020 --> 00:59:42.340]   I mean, to the naked eye,
[00:59:42.340 --> 00:59:45.340]   they look almost the same as maps of brain activation
[00:59:45.340 --> 00:59:47.420]   when people remember the past.
[00:59:47.420 --> 00:59:48.940]   According to our theory,
[00:59:48.940 --> 00:59:50.540]   and we've got some data to support this,
[00:59:50.540 --> 00:59:53.620]   we've broken up this network into various sub-pieces,
[00:59:53.620 --> 00:59:55.980]   is that basically it's kind of taking apart
[00:59:55.980 --> 00:59:57.660]   all of our experiences
[00:59:57.660 --> 00:59:59.980]   and creating these little Lego blocks out of them.
[00:59:59.980 --> 01:00:02.020]   And then you can put them back together
[01:00:02.020 --> 01:00:03.420]   if you have the right instructions
[01:00:03.420 --> 01:00:06.260]   to recreate these experiences that you've had,
[01:00:06.260 --> 01:00:08.620]   but you could also reassemble them into new pieces
[01:00:08.620 --> 01:00:11.820]   to create a model of an event that hasn't happened yet.
[01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:13.460]   And that's what we think happens.
[01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:18.420]   Our common ground that we're establishing in language
[01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:20.620]   requires using those building blocks
[01:00:20.620 --> 01:00:23.380]   to put together a model of what's going on.
[01:00:23.380 --> 01:00:25.100]   - Well, there's a good percentage of time
[01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:28.260]   I personally live in the imagined world.
[01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:31.480]   I think of, I do thought experiments a lot.
[01:00:32.860 --> 01:00:37.860]   I take the absurdity of human life as it stands
[01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:44.020]   and play it forward in all kinds of different directions.
[01:00:44.020 --> 01:00:47.540]   Sometimes it's rigorous thought experiments,
[01:00:47.540 --> 01:00:48.500]   sometimes it's fun ones.
[01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:52.380]   So I imagine that that has an effect
[01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:54.540]   on how I remember things.
[01:00:54.540 --> 01:00:56.700]   And I suppose I have to be a little bit careful
[01:00:56.700 --> 01:00:58.340]   to make sure stuff happened
[01:00:58.340 --> 01:01:02.300]   versus stuff that I just imagined happened.
[01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:05.900]   And this also, I mean, some of my best friends
[01:01:05.900 --> 01:01:09.620]   are characters inside books that never even existed.
[01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:13.540]   And there's some degree
[01:01:13.540 --> 01:01:16.300]   to which they actually exist in my mind.
[01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:18.300]   Like these characters exist, authors exist,
[01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:22.620]   Dostoevsky exists, but also Brothers Karamazov.
[01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:23.700]   - I love that book.
[01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:24.540]   - Yeah.
[01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:25.700]   - It's one of the few books I've read.
[01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:26.820]   (laughing)
[01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:28.700]   One of the few literature books that I've read,
[01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:29.540]   I should say.
[01:01:29.540 --> 01:01:31.020]   I read a lot in school that I don't remember,
[01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:32.300]   but Brothers Karamazov.
[01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:33.380]   - But they exist.
[01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:36.060]   They exist, and I have almost conversations with them.
[01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:36.900]   It's interesting.
[01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:39.740]   It's interesting to allow your brain
[01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:43.100]   to kind of play with ideas of the past,
[01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:46.060]   of the imagined, and see it all as one.
[01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:49.060]   - Yeah, there was actually this famous mnemonist.
[01:01:49.060 --> 01:01:50.260]   He's kind of like back then
[01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:51.780]   the equivalent of a memory athlete,
[01:01:51.780 --> 01:01:54.580]   except he would go to shows and do this.
[01:01:54.580 --> 01:01:57.100]   That was described by this really famous
[01:01:57.100 --> 01:02:00.340]   neuropsychologist from Russia named Luria.
[01:02:00.340 --> 01:02:03.780]   And so this guy was named Solomon Sharoshevsky,
[01:02:03.780 --> 01:02:06.460]   and he had this condition called synesthesia
[01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:09.380]   that basically created these weird associations
[01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:12.860]   between different senses that normally wouldn't go together.
[01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:17.860]   So that gave him this incredibly vivid imagination
[01:02:17.860 --> 01:02:20.820]   that he would use to basically imagine
[01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:24.180]   all sorts of things that he would need to memorize,
[01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:25.780]   and he would just imagine,
[01:02:25.780 --> 01:02:29.100]   just create these incredibly detailed things in his head
[01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:32.420]   that allowed him to memorize all sorts of stuff.
[01:02:32.420 --> 01:02:35.300]   But it also really haunted him by some reports
[01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:39.100]   that basically it was like he was at some point,
[01:02:39.100 --> 01:02:41.140]   and again, who knows if the drinking was part of this,
[01:02:41.140 --> 01:02:42.980]   but at some point had trouble
[01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:46.300]   differentiating his imagination from reality, right?
[01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:48.940]   And this is interesting because it's like,
[01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:52.340]   I mean, that's what psychosis is in some ways,
[01:02:52.340 --> 01:02:56.940]   is you, first of all, you're just learning connections
[01:02:56.940 --> 01:03:00.260]   from prediction errors that you probably shouldn't learn,
[01:03:00.260 --> 01:03:04.180]   and the other part of it is that your internal signals
[01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:06.740]   are being confused with actual things
[01:03:06.740 --> 01:03:08.780]   in the outside world, right?
[01:03:08.780 --> 01:03:10.220]   - Well, that's why a lot of this stuff
[01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:11.700]   is both feature and bug.
[01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:13.140]   It's a double-edged sword.
[01:03:13.140 --> 01:03:13.980]   - Yeah, I mean, it might be why
[01:03:13.980 --> 01:03:15.680]   there's such an interesting relationship
[01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:17.600]   between genius and psychosis.
[01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:22.420]   - Yeah, maybe they're just two sides of the same coin.
[01:03:22.420 --> 01:03:25.940]   Humans are fascinating, aren't they?
[01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:29.820]   - I think so, sometimes scary, but mostly fascinating.
[01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:33.220]   - Can we just talk about memory sport a little longer?
[01:03:33.220 --> 01:03:36.460]   There's something called the USA Memory Championship.
[01:03:36.460 --> 01:03:38.940]   Like, what are these athletes like?
[01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:42.620]   What does it mean to be like elite level at this?
[01:03:42.620 --> 01:03:44.160]   Have you interacted with any of them,
[01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:45.380]   or reading about them,
[01:03:45.380 --> 01:03:47.100]   what have you learned about these folks?
[01:03:47.100 --> 01:03:49.140]   - There's a guy named Henry Roediger
[01:03:49.140 --> 01:03:50.460]   who's studying these guys,
[01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:52.980]   and there's actually a book by Joshua Foer
[01:03:52.980 --> 01:03:54.800]   called "Moonwalking with Einstein"
[01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:56.340]   where he talks about,
[01:03:56.340 --> 01:03:58.020]   he actually, as part of this book,
[01:03:58.020 --> 01:04:00.940]   just decided to become a memory athlete.
[01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:02.860]   They often have these life events
[01:04:02.860 --> 01:04:05.660]   that make them go, "Hey, why don't I do this?"
[01:04:05.660 --> 01:04:07.340]   So there was a guy named Scott Hagwood,
[01:04:07.340 --> 01:04:08.520]   who I write about,
[01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:13.520]   who thought that he was getting chemo for cancer.
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:18.020]   And so he decided, like, because the chemo,
[01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:20.780]   there's a well-known thing called chemo brain
[01:04:20.780 --> 01:04:21.820]   where people become like,
[01:04:21.820 --> 01:04:23.900]   they just lose a lot of their sharpness.
[01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:27.000]   And so he wanted to fight that
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.760]   by learning these memory skills.
[01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:29.760]   So he bought a book,
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:32.600]   and this is the story you hear in a lot of memory athletes
[01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:35.640]   is they buy a book by other memory athletes,
[01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:38.320]   or other memory experts, so to speak,
[01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:40.080]   and they just learn those skills
[01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:42.160]   and practice them over and over again.
[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:44.120]   They start by winning bets and so forth,
[01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:45.760]   and then they go into these competitions.
[01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:48.040]   And the competitions are typically things
[01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:50.880]   like memorizing long strings of numbers,
[01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:54.500]   or memorizing orders of cards, and so forth.
[01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:56.820]   So there tend to be pretty arbitrary things,
[01:04:56.820 --> 01:04:59.100]   not like things that would be able,
[01:04:59.100 --> 01:05:01.820]   you'd be able to bring a lot of prior knowledge.
[01:05:01.820 --> 01:05:03.860]   But they build the skills
[01:05:03.860 --> 01:05:06.060]   that you need to memorize arbitrary things.
[01:05:06.060 --> 01:05:07.140]   - Yeah, that's fascinating.
[01:05:07.140 --> 01:05:09.780]   I've gotten a chance to work with something called
[01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:12.620]   NBAC tasks, so there's all these kinds of tasks,
[01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:16.300]   memory recall tasks that are used to kinda load up
[01:05:16.300 --> 01:05:17.900]   the quote-unquote working memory.
[01:05:17.900 --> 01:05:18.740]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:05:18.740 --> 01:05:21.620]   - And to see, a psychologist used it
[01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:22.700]   to test all kinds of stuff,
[01:05:22.700 --> 01:05:25.580]   like to see how well you're good at multitasking.
[01:05:25.580 --> 01:05:28.300]   We used it in particular for the task of driving,
[01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:30.580]   like if you fill up your brain
[01:05:30.580 --> 01:05:35.340]   with intensive working memory tasks,
[01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:38.980]   how good are you at also not crashing?
[01:05:38.980 --> 01:05:39.980]   That kind of stuff.
[01:05:39.980 --> 01:05:42.700]   So it's fascinating, but again,
[01:05:42.700 --> 01:05:44.380]   those tasks are arbitrary,
[01:05:44.380 --> 01:05:47.300]   and they're usually about recalling a sequence of numbers
[01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:50.580]   in some kinda semi-complex way.
[01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:53.140]   Are you, do you have any favorite tasks of this nature
[01:05:53.140 --> 01:05:55.860]   in your own studies?
[01:05:55.860 --> 01:05:58.620]   - I've really been most excited
[01:05:58.620 --> 01:06:00.700]   about going in the opposite direction
[01:06:00.700 --> 01:06:03.980]   and using things that are more and more naturalistic.
[01:06:03.980 --> 01:06:07.900]   And the reason is is that we've moved in that direction
[01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:11.020]   because what we found is that memory works
[01:06:11.020 --> 01:06:14.260]   very, very differently when you study it,
[01:06:14.260 --> 01:06:16.300]   when you study memory in the way
[01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:18.780]   that people typically remember.
[01:06:18.780 --> 01:06:22.460]   And so it goes into a much more predictive mode,
[01:06:22.460 --> 01:06:25.260]   and you have these event boundaries, for instance,
[01:06:25.260 --> 01:06:29.340]   and you have, but a lot of what happens
[01:06:29.340 --> 01:06:31.380]   is this kind of fascinating mix
[01:06:31.380 --> 01:06:32.500]   that we've been talking about,
[01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:37.220]   a mix of interpretations and imagination with perception.
[01:06:37.220 --> 01:06:41.140]   And so, and the new direction we're going in
[01:06:41.140 --> 01:06:45.180]   is understanding navigation in our memory first places.
[01:06:45.180 --> 01:06:47.500]   And the reason is is that there's a lot of work
[01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:50.380]   that's done in rats, which is very good work.
[01:06:50.380 --> 01:06:52.900]   They have a rat, and they put it in a box,
[01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:55.140]   and the rat goes, chases cheese in a box,
[01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:57.380]   and you'll find cells in the hippocampus
[01:06:57.380 --> 01:07:01.260]   that fire when a rat is in different places in the box.
[01:07:01.260 --> 01:07:04.820]   And so the conventional wisdom is that the hippocampus
[01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:07.540]   forms this map of the box.
[01:07:07.540 --> 01:07:11.540]   And I think that probably may happen
[01:07:11.540 --> 01:07:16.540]   when you have absolutely no knowledge of the world, right?
[01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:19.380]   But I think one of the cool things about human memory
[01:07:19.380 --> 01:07:22.020]   is we can bring to bear our past experiences
[01:07:22.020 --> 01:07:24.860]   to economically learn new ones.
[01:07:24.860 --> 01:07:29.420]   And so, for instance, if you learn a map of an Ikea,
[01:07:29.420 --> 01:07:31.220]   let's say if I go to the Ikea in Austin,
[01:07:31.220 --> 01:07:32.940]   I'm sure there's one here,
[01:07:32.940 --> 01:07:36.300]   I probably could go to this Ikea and find my way
[01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:39.820]   to where the wine glasses are
[01:07:39.820 --> 01:07:41.780]   without having to even think about it
[01:07:41.780 --> 01:07:43.540]   because it's got a very similar layout.
[01:07:43.540 --> 01:07:45.980]   Even though Ikea is a nightmare to get around,
[01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:49.500]   once I learn my local Ikea, I can use that map everywhere.
[01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:53.140]   Why form a brand new one for a new place?
[01:07:53.140 --> 01:07:57.180]   And so that kind of ability to reuse information
[01:07:57.180 --> 01:08:00.460]   really comes into play when we look at things
[01:08:00.460 --> 01:08:03.600]   that are more naturalistic tasks.
[01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:07.020]   And another thing that we're really interested in
[01:08:07.020 --> 01:08:11.740]   is this idea of what if instead of basically mapping out
[01:08:11.740 --> 01:08:13.820]   every coordinate in a space,
[01:08:13.820 --> 01:08:17.020]   you form a pretty economical graph
[01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:20.260]   that connects basically the major landmarks together
[01:08:20.260 --> 01:08:24.020]   and being able to use that as emphasizing the things
[01:08:24.020 --> 01:08:26.900]   that are most important, the places that you go for food
[01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:30.740]   and the places that are landmarks that help you get around.
[01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:32.900]   And then filling in the blanks for the rest
[01:08:32.900 --> 01:08:36.380]   because I really believe that cognitive maps
[01:08:36.380 --> 01:08:38.420]   or mental maps of the world,
[01:08:38.420 --> 01:08:42.060]   just like our memories for events, are not photographic.
[01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:43.740]   I think they're this combination
[01:08:43.740 --> 01:08:46.980]   of actual verifiable details
[01:08:46.980 --> 01:08:49.740]   and then a lot of inference that you make.
[01:08:49.740 --> 01:08:50.820]   - So what have you learned
[01:08:50.820 --> 01:08:54.900]   about this kind of spatial mapping of places?
[01:08:54.900 --> 01:08:57.580]   How do people represent locations?
[01:08:57.580 --> 01:09:00.220]   - There's a lot of variability, I think,
[01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:01.980]   and there's a lot of disagreement
[01:09:01.980 --> 01:09:04.580]   about how people represent locations.
[01:09:04.580 --> 01:09:07.900]   In a world of GPS and physical maps,
[01:09:07.900 --> 01:09:10.300]   people can learn it from basically
[01:09:10.300 --> 01:09:12.140]   what they call survey perspective,
[01:09:12.140 --> 01:09:13.380]   being able to see everything.
[01:09:13.380 --> 01:09:16.780]   And so that's one way in which humans can do it
[01:09:16.780 --> 01:09:18.820]   that's a little bit different.
[01:09:18.820 --> 01:09:21.780]   There's one way in which we can memorize routes.
[01:09:21.780 --> 01:09:23.820]   I know how to get from here to,
[01:09:23.820 --> 01:09:26.380]   let's say if I walk here from my hotel,
[01:09:26.380 --> 01:09:29.420]   I can just rigidly follow that route back, right?
[01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:31.740]   And there's another more integrative way,
[01:09:31.740 --> 01:09:34.500]   which would be what's called a cognitive map,
[01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:36.700]   which would be kind of a sense
[01:09:36.700 --> 01:09:38.860]   of how everything relates to each other.
[01:09:38.860 --> 01:09:42.460]   And so there's lots of people who believe
[01:09:42.460 --> 01:09:45.660]   that these maps that we have in our head
[01:09:45.660 --> 01:09:47.140]   are isomorphic with the world.
[01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:49.900]   They're like these literal coordinates
[01:09:49.900 --> 01:09:51.660]   that follow Euclidean space.
[01:09:51.660 --> 01:09:54.060]   And as you know, Euclidean mathematics
[01:09:54.060 --> 01:09:55.940]   is very constrained, right?
[01:09:55.940 --> 01:09:59.580]   And I think that we are actually much more generative
[01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:01.140]   in our maps of space
[01:10:01.140 --> 01:10:03.260]   so that we do have these bits and pieces.
[01:10:03.260 --> 01:10:06.940]   And we've got a small task as it's right now,
[01:10:06.940 --> 01:10:10.140]   not yet like we need to do some work on it
[01:10:10.140 --> 01:10:11.260]   for further analysis.
[01:10:11.260 --> 01:10:13.340]   But one of the things we're looking at
[01:10:13.340 --> 01:10:17.300]   is these signals called ripples in the hippocampus,
[01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:20.540]   which are these bursts of activity that you see
[01:10:20.540 --> 01:10:23.580]   that are synchronized with areas in the neocortex
[01:10:23.580 --> 01:10:25.540]   in the default network actually.
[01:10:25.540 --> 01:10:28.340]   And so what we find is that those ripples
[01:10:28.340 --> 01:10:31.380]   seem to increase at navigationally important points
[01:10:31.380 --> 01:10:32.700]   when you're making a decision
[01:10:32.700 --> 01:10:34.660]   or when you reach a goal.
[01:10:34.660 --> 01:10:37.020]   So it speaks to the emotion thing, right?
[01:10:37.020 --> 01:10:39.180]   'Cause if you have limited choices,
[01:10:39.180 --> 01:10:41.000]   if I'm walking down a street,
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:45.200]   I could really just get a mental map of the neighborhood
[01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:46.780]   with a more minimal kind of thing
[01:10:46.780 --> 01:10:48.980]   by just saying here's the intersections
[01:10:48.980 --> 01:10:51.700]   and here's the directions I take to get in between them.
[01:10:51.700 --> 01:10:54.100]   And what we found in general in our MRI studies
[01:10:54.100 --> 01:10:59.100]   is basically the more people can reduce the problem,
[01:10:59.660 --> 01:11:03.260]   whether it's space or any kind of decision-making problem,
[01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:06.100]   the less the hippocampus encodes.
[01:11:06.100 --> 01:11:08.100]   It really is very economical
[01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:13.100]   towards the points of highest information content and value.
[01:11:13.100 --> 01:11:17.100]   - So can you describe the encoding in the hippocampus
[01:11:17.100 --> 01:11:19.060]   and the ripples you were talking about?
[01:11:19.060 --> 01:11:23.780]   What's the signal in which we see the ripples?
[01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:25.300]   - Yeah, so this is really interesting.
[01:11:25.300 --> 01:11:27.420]   There are these oscillations, right?
[01:11:27.420 --> 01:11:29.900]   So there's these waves that you basically see,
[01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:33.900]   and these waves are points of very high excitability
[01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:35.740]   and low excitability.
[01:11:35.740 --> 01:11:37.660]   And at least during,
[01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:39.860]   they happen actually during slow wave sleep too.
[01:11:39.860 --> 01:11:41.500]   So the deepest stages of sleep
[01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:43.660]   when you're just zonked out, right?
[01:11:43.660 --> 01:11:47.000]   You see these very slow waves where it's like very excitable
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.660]   and then very unexcitable, it goes up and down.
[01:11:49.660 --> 01:11:50.680]   And on top of them,
[01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:53.220]   you'll see these little sharp wave ripples.
[01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:56.260]   And when there's a ripple in the hippocampus,
[01:11:56.260 --> 01:11:58.940]   you tend to see a sequence of cells
[01:11:58.940 --> 01:12:02.420]   that resemble a sequence of cells that fire
[01:12:02.420 --> 01:12:06.100]   when an animal's actually doing something in the world.
[01:12:06.100 --> 01:12:09.960]   So it almost is like a little, people call it replay.
[01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:11.900]   I think it's a little bit, I don't like that term,
[01:12:11.900 --> 01:12:16.580]   but it's basically a little bit of a compressed play
[01:12:16.580 --> 01:12:19.620]   of the sequence of activity in the brain
[01:12:19.620 --> 01:12:21.520]   that was taking place earlier.
[01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:23.340]   And during those moments,
[01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:25.260]   there's a little window of communication
[01:12:25.260 --> 01:12:28.220]   between the hippocampus and these areas in the neocortex.
[01:12:28.220 --> 01:12:32.820]   And so that, I think, helps you form new memories,
[01:12:32.820 --> 01:12:35.820]   but it also helps you, I think, stabilize them,
[01:12:35.820 --> 01:12:39.020]   but also really connect different things together in memory
[01:12:39.020 --> 01:12:40.480]   and allows you to build bridges
[01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:43.020]   between different events that you've had.
[01:12:43.020 --> 01:12:46.620]   And so this is one of, at least our theories of sleep
[01:12:46.620 --> 01:12:49.720]   and its real role in helping you see the connections
[01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:52.380]   between different events that you've experienced.
[01:12:52.380 --> 01:12:55.220]   - So during sleep is when the connections are formed.
[01:12:55.220 --> 01:12:58.380]   - The connections between different events, right?
[01:12:58.380 --> 01:13:01.900]   So it's like, you see me now, you see me next week,
[01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:03.780]   you see me a month later.
[01:13:03.780 --> 01:13:05.940]   You start to build a little internal model
[01:13:05.940 --> 01:13:09.620]   of how I behave and what to expect of me.
[01:13:09.620 --> 01:13:12.780]   And with sleep, one of the things that allows you to do
[01:13:12.780 --> 01:13:16.340]   is figure out those connections and connect the dots
[01:13:16.340 --> 01:13:18.360]   and find the signal and the noise.
[01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:21.380]   - So you mentioned fMRI.
[01:13:21.380 --> 01:13:24.380]   What is it and how is it used in studying memory?
[01:13:24.380 --> 01:13:26.180]   - This is actually the reason why I got
[01:13:26.180 --> 01:13:28.620]   into this whole field of sciences.
[01:13:28.620 --> 01:13:32.840]   When I was in grad school, fMRI was just really taking off
[01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:35.580]   as a technique for studying brain activity.
[01:13:35.580 --> 01:13:38.380]   And what's beautiful about it is you can study
[01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:42.440]   the whole human brain and there's lots of limits to it,
[01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:44.940]   but you can basically do it in person
[01:13:44.940 --> 01:13:47.580]   without sticking anything into their brains
[01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:49.300]   and very non-invasive.
[01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:50.940]   I mean, for me, being an MRI scanner
[01:13:50.940 --> 01:13:53.420]   is like being in the womb, I just fall asleep.
[01:13:53.420 --> 01:13:55.420]   If I'm not being asked to do anything,
[01:13:55.420 --> 01:13:57.660]   I get very sleepy, you know?
[01:13:57.660 --> 01:14:00.140]   But you can have people watch movies
[01:14:00.140 --> 01:14:01.260]   while they're being scanned,
[01:14:01.260 --> 01:14:03.140]   or you can have them do tests of memory,
[01:14:03.140 --> 01:14:06.460]   like giving them words and so forth to memorize.
[01:14:06.460 --> 01:14:10.180]   But what MRI is itself is just this technique
[01:14:10.180 --> 01:14:15.060]   where you put people in a very high magnetic field.
[01:14:15.060 --> 01:14:17.380]   Typical ones we would use would be three Tesla
[01:14:17.380 --> 01:14:18.860]   to give you an idea.
[01:14:18.860 --> 01:14:21.740]   So a three Tesla magnet, you put somebody in,
[01:14:21.740 --> 01:14:24.340]   and what happens is you get this very weak,
[01:14:24.340 --> 01:14:28.300]   but measurable magnetization in the brain.
[01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:31.140]   And then you apply a radiofrequency pulse,
[01:14:31.140 --> 01:14:33.740]   which is basically a different electromagnetic field.
[01:14:33.740 --> 01:14:36.060]   And so you're basically using water,
[01:14:36.060 --> 01:14:40.100]   the water molecules in the brain as a tracer, so to speak.
[01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:43.900]   And part of it in fMRI is the fact
[01:14:43.900 --> 01:14:47.220]   that these magnetic fields that you mess with
[01:14:47.740 --> 01:14:52.100]   by manipulating these radiofrequency pulses
[01:14:52.100 --> 01:14:53.500]   and the static field,
[01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:55.420]   and you have things called gradients
[01:14:55.420 --> 01:14:57.460]   which change the strength of the magnetic field
[01:14:57.460 --> 01:14:58.900]   in different parts of the head.
[01:14:58.900 --> 01:15:01.220]   So they're all, we tweak them in different ways,
[01:15:01.220 --> 01:15:04.100]   but the basic idea that we use in fMRI
[01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:07.060]   is that blood is flowing to the brain.
[01:15:07.060 --> 01:15:10.700]   And when you have blood that doesn't have oxygen on it,
[01:15:10.700 --> 01:15:14.060]   it's a little bit more magnetizable than blood that does,
[01:15:14.060 --> 01:15:16.660]   'cause you have hemoglobin that carries the oxygen,
[01:15:16.660 --> 01:15:20.100]   the iron, basically, in the blood that makes it red.
[01:15:20.100 --> 01:15:23.540]   And so that hemoglobin, when it's deoxygenated,
[01:15:23.540 --> 01:15:27.500]   actually has different magnetic field properties
[01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:29.220]   than when it has oxygen.
[01:15:29.220 --> 01:15:32.020]   And it turns out when you have an increase
[01:15:32.020 --> 01:15:34.540]   in local activity in some part of the brain,
[01:15:34.540 --> 01:15:37.220]   the blood flows there, and as a result,
[01:15:37.220 --> 01:15:42.020]   you get a lower concentration of hemoglobin
[01:15:42.020 --> 01:15:45.140]   that is not oxygenated.
[01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:47.580]   - And then that gives you more signal.
[01:15:47.580 --> 01:15:51.620]   So I gave you, I think I sent you a gif,
[01:15:51.620 --> 01:15:52.860]   as you like to say.
[01:15:52.860 --> 01:15:56.140]   - Yeah, we had an off-record intense argument
[01:15:56.140 --> 01:15:58.900]   about if it's pronounced jif or gif,
[01:15:58.900 --> 01:16:02.140]   but we shall set that aside as friends.
[01:16:02.140 --> 01:16:05.060]   - We could've called it a stern rebuke, perhaps.
[01:16:05.060 --> 01:16:06.500]   - Rebuke, yeah.
[01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:08.220]   I drew a hard line.
[01:16:08.220 --> 01:16:12.220]   It is true, the creator of gifs said it's pronounced jif,
[01:16:12.260 --> 01:16:15.140]   but that's the only person that pronounces jif.
[01:16:15.140 --> 01:16:19.420]   Anyway, yes, you sent a gif of--
[01:16:19.420 --> 01:16:24.220]   - This would be basically a whole movie of fMRI data.
[01:16:24.220 --> 01:16:26.220]   And so when you look at it, it's not very impressive.
[01:16:26.220 --> 01:16:29.780]   It looks like these very pixelated maps of the brain,
[01:16:29.780 --> 01:16:31.220]   but it's mostly kind of like white.
[01:16:31.220 --> 01:16:35.720]   But these tiny changes in the intensity of those signals
[01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:38.380]   that you probably wouldn't be able to visually perceive,
[01:16:38.380 --> 01:16:40.940]   like about 1% can be statistically
[01:16:40.940 --> 01:16:43.060]   very, very large effects for us.
[01:16:43.060 --> 01:16:44.740]   And that allows us to see,
[01:16:44.740 --> 01:16:46.900]   hey, there's an increase in activity
[01:16:46.900 --> 01:16:50.180]   in some part of the brain when I'm doing some task,
[01:16:50.180 --> 01:16:52.020]   like trying to remember something.
[01:16:52.020 --> 01:16:55.220]   And I can use those changes to even predict,
[01:16:55.220 --> 01:16:58.420]   is a person going to remember this later or not?
[01:16:58.420 --> 01:17:00.340]   And the coolest thing that people have done
[01:17:00.340 --> 01:17:04.820]   is to decode what people are remembering
[01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:07.260]   from the patterns of activity.
[01:17:07.260 --> 01:17:09.100]   'Cause maybe when I'm remembering this thing,
[01:17:09.100 --> 01:17:12.540]   like I'm remembering the house where I grew up,
[01:17:12.540 --> 01:17:15.580]   I might have one pixel that's bright in the hippocampus
[01:17:15.580 --> 01:17:17.020]   and one that's dark.
[01:17:17.020 --> 01:17:21.900]   And if I'm remembering something more like the car
[01:17:21.900 --> 01:17:23.420]   that I used to drive when I was 16,
[01:17:23.420 --> 01:17:24.860]   I might see the opposite pattern
[01:17:24.860 --> 01:17:26.620]   where a different pixel's bright.
[01:17:26.620 --> 01:17:30.100]   And so all that little stuff that we used to think of noise,
[01:17:30.100 --> 01:17:32.940]   we can now think of almost like a QR code for memory,
[01:17:32.940 --> 01:17:34.700]   so to speak, where different memories
[01:17:34.700 --> 01:17:36.740]   have a different little pattern
[01:17:36.740 --> 01:17:38.900]   of bright pixels and dark pixels.
[01:17:38.900 --> 01:17:40.980]   And so this really revolutionized my research.
[01:17:40.980 --> 01:17:44.460]   So there's fancy research out there where people really,
[01:17:44.460 --> 01:17:45.300]   I mean, not even that,
[01:17:45.300 --> 01:17:47.460]   I mean, by your standards, this would be Stone Age,
[01:17:47.460 --> 01:17:49.900]   but applying machine learning techniques
[01:17:49.900 --> 01:17:51.500]   to do decoding and so forth.
[01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:54.260]   And now there's a lot of forward encoding models
[01:17:54.260 --> 01:17:56.980]   and you can go to town with this stuff, right?
[01:17:56.980 --> 01:18:01.300]   And I'm much more old school of designing experiments
[01:18:01.300 --> 01:18:02.900]   where you basically say, okay,
[01:18:02.900 --> 01:18:06.660]   here's a whole web of memories that overlap
[01:18:06.660 --> 01:18:08.660]   in some way, shape, or form.
[01:18:08.660 --> 01:18:11.500]   Do memories that occurred in the same place
[01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:14.260]   have a similar QR code?
[01:18:14.260 --> 01:18:15.780]   And do memories that occurred in different places
[01:18:15.780 --> 01:18:16.860]   have a different QR code?
[01:18:16.860 --> 01:18:20.540]   And you can just use things like correlation coefficients
[01:18:20.540 --> 01:18:23.180]   or cosine distance to measure that stuff, right?
[01:18:23.180 --> 01:18:24.780]   Super simple, right?
[01:18:24.780 --> 01:18:26.820]   And so what happens is you can start
[01:18:26.820 --> 01:18:30.220]   to get a whole state space of how a brain area
[01:18:30.220 --> 01:18:32.580]   is indexing all these different memories.
[01:18:32.580 --> 01:18:34.980]   And it's super fascinating because what we could see
[01:18:34.980 --> 01:18:37.300]   is this little like separation
[01:18:37.300 --> 01:18:40.580]   between how certain brain areas are processing memory
[01:18:40.580 --> 01:18:43.060]   for who was there and other brain areas
[01:18:43.060 --> 01:18:45.700]   are processing information about where it occurred
[01:18:45.700 --> 01:18:48.100]   or the situation that's kind of unfolding.
[01:18:48.100 --> 01:18:50.700]   And some are giving you information about
[01:18:50.700 --> 01:18:53.620]   what are my goals that are involved and so forth.
[01:18:53.620 --> 01:18:56.740]   And the hippocampus is just putting it all together
[01:18:56.740 --> 01:18:59.300]   into these unique things that just are about
[01:18:59.300 --> 01:19:00.780]   when and where it happened.
[01:19:00.780 --> 01:19:05.780]   - So there is a separation between spatial information,
[01:19:06.220 --> 01:19:11.220]   concepts, like literally there's distinct,
[01:19:11.220 --> 01:19:13.340]   as you said, QR codes for these?
[01:19:13.340 --> 01:19:14.180]   - So to speak.
[01:19:14.180 --> 01:19:15.860]   Let me try a different analogy too
[01:19:15.860 --> 01:19:18.500]   that might be more accessible for people,
[01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:21.420]   which would be like you've got a folder on your computer,
[01:19:21.420 --> 01:19:24.060]   right, and you open it up, there's a bunch of files there.
[01:19:24.060 --> 01:19:28.700]   I can sort those files by alphabetical order.
[01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:30.780]   And now things that both start with letter A
[01:19:30.780 --> 01:19:32.180]   are lumped together.
[01:19:32.180 --> 01:19:35.820]   And things that start with Z versus A are far apart, right?
[01:19:35.820 --> 01:19:38.620]   And so that is one way of organizing the folder,
[01:19:38.620 --> 01:19:40.180]   but I could do it by date.
[01:19:40.180 --> 01:19:41.180]   And if I do it by date,
[01:19:41.180 --> 01:19:44.700]   things that were created close together in time are close
[01:19:44.700 --> 01:19:47.060]   and things that are far apart in time are far.
[01:19:47.060 --> 01:19:51.500]   So every, like you can think of how a brain area
[01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:54.540]   or a network of areas contributes to memory
[01:19:54.540 --> 01:19:57.220]   by looking at what the sorting scheme is.
[01:19:57.220 --> 01:19:59.980]   And these QR codes that we're talking about
[01:19:59.980 --> 01:20:02.620]   that you get from fMRI allow you to do that.
[01:20:02.620 --> 01:20:04.220]   And you can do the same thing if you're recording
[01:20:04.220 --> 01:20:09.140]   from massive populations of neurons in an animal.
[01:20:09.140 --> 01:20:12.660]   And you can do it for recording local potentials
[01:20:12.660 --> 01:20:16.740]   in the brain, you know, so little waves of activity
[01:20:16.740 --> 01:20:19.340]   in let's say a human who has epilepsy
[01:20:19.340 --> 01:20:20.860]   and they stick electrodes in their brain
[01:20:20.860 --> 01:20:22.240]   to try to find the seizures.
[01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:24.860]   So that's some of the work that we're doing now.
[01:20:24.860 --> 01:20:27.340]   But all of these techniques basically allow you to say,
[01:20:27.340 --> 01:20:29.820]   hey, what's the sorting scheme?
[01:20:29.820 --> 01:20:32.500]   And so we've found that some networks of the brain
[01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:36.480]   sort information in memory according to who was there.
[01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:39.460]   So I might have, like we've actually shown
[01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:41.540]   in one of my favorite studies of all time
[01:20:41.540 --> 01:20:44.260]   that was done by a former postdoc, Zach Rea.
[01:20:44.260 --> 01:20:47.860]   And Zach did the study where we had a bunch of movies
[01:20:47.860 --> 01:20:50.020]   with different people in my labs.
[01:20:50.020 --> 01:20:52.100]   There were two different people and he filmed them
[01:20:52.100 --> 01:20:55.420]   at two different cafes and two different supermarkets.
[01:20:55.420 --> 01:20:58.380]   And what he could show is in one particular network,
[01:20:58.380 --> 01:21:02.620]   you could find the same kind of pattern of activity
[01:21:02.620 --> 01:21:05.700]   more or less, a very similar pattern of activity
[01:21:05.700 --> 01:21:09.040]   every time I saw Alex in one of these movies,
[01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:10.900]   no matter where he was, right?
[01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:15.100]   And I could see another one that was like a common pattern
[01:21:15.100 --> 01:21:16.860]   that happened every time I saw
[01:21:16.860 --> 01:21:19.880]   this particular supermarket nugget, you know?
[01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:23.180]   And so, and it didn't matter whether you're watching a movie
[01:21:23.180 --> 01:21:25.180]   or whether you're recalling the movie,
[01:21:25.180 --> 01:21:27.540]   it's the same kind of pattern that comes up, right?
[01:21:27.540 --> 01:21:29.200]   - That's so fascinating. - It is fascinating.
[01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:31.340]   And so now you have those building blocks
[01:21:31.340 --> 01:21:35.820]   for assembling a model of what's happening in the present,
[01:21:35.820 --> 01:21:39.180]   imagining what could happen and remembering things
[01:21:39.180 --> 01:21:41.740]   very economically from putting together all these pieces
[01:21:41.740 --> 01:21:43.760]   so that all the hippocampus has to do
[01:21:43.760 --> 01:21:46.020]   is get the right kind of blueprint
[01:21:46.020 --> 01:21:48.620]   for how to put together all these building blocks.
[01:21:48.620 --> 01:21:51.700]   - These are all like beautiful hints
[01:21:51.700 --> 01:21:54.540]   at a super interesting system
[01:21:54.540 --> 01:21:56.340]   that makes me wonder on the other side of it,
[01:21:56.340 --> 01:21:57.740]   how to build it.
[01:21:57.740 --> 01:22:00.140]   But it's like, it's fascinating.
[01:22:00.140 --> 01:22:01.740]   Like the way it does the encoding
[01:22:01.740 --> 01:22:03.420]   is really, really fascinating.
[01:22:03.420 --> 01:22:06.500]   Or I guess the symptoms, the results of that encoding
[01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:08.180]   are fascinating to study from this.
[01:22:08.180 --> 01:22:09.660]   Just as a small tangent,
[01:22:09.660 --> 01:22:13.820]   you mentioned sort of the measuring local potentials
[01:22:13.820 --> 01:22:16.900]   with electrodes versus fMRI.
[01:22:16.900 --> 01:22:17.740]   - Oh yeah.
[01:22:17.740 --> 01:22:21.020]   - What are some interesting like limitations,
[01:22:21.020 --> 01:22:22.920]   possibilities of fMRI?
[01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:25.460]   Maybe, the way you explained it is like brilliant
[01:22:25.460 --> 01:22:30.460]   with blood and detecting the activations
[01:22:30.460 --> 01:22:34.260]   or the excitation because blood flows to that area.
[01:22:34.260 --> 01:22:36.300]   What's like the latency of that?
[01:22:36.300 --> 01:22:39.020]   Like what's the blood dynamics in the brain?
[01:22:39.020 --> 01:22:39.860]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:22:39.860 --> 01:22:40.980]   - Like how quickly can it,
[01:22:40.980 --> 01:22:44.780]   how quickly can the task change and all that kind of stuff?
[01:22:44.780 --> 01:22:46.860]   - Yeah, I mean, it's very slow.
[01:22:46.860 --> 01:22:51.540]   To the brain, 50 milliseconds is like, you know,
[01:22:51.540 --> 01:22:53.380]   like it's an eternity.
[01:22:53.940 --> 01:22:57.380]   Maybe not 50, you know, maybe like, you know,
[01:22:57.380 --> 01:23:00.300]   let's say half a second, 500 milliseconds.
[01:23:00.300 --> 01:23:02.340]   Just so much back and forth stuff
[01:23:02.340 --> 01:23:04.460]   happens in the brain in that time, right?
[01:23:04.460 --> 01:23:09.460]   So in fMRI, you can measure these magnetic field responses
[01:23:09.460 --> 01:23:12.940]   about six seconds after that burst of activity
[01:23:12.940 --> 01:23:14.160]   would take place.
[01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:16.220]   All these things, it's like, is it a feature
[01:23:16.220 --> 01:23:17.580]   or is it a bug, right?
[01:23:17.580 --> 01:23:19.540]   So one of the interesting things that's been discovered
[01:23:19.540 --> 01:23:23.140]   about fMRI is it's not so tightly related
[01:23:23.140 --> 01:23:25.900]   to the spiking of the neurons.
[01:23:25.900 --> 01:23:29.060]   So we tend to think of the computation, so to speak,
[01:23:29.060 --> 01:23:30.980]   as being driven by spikes,
[01:23:30.980 --> 01:23:32.940]   meaning like there's just a burst of,
[01:23:32.940 --> 01:23:34.540]   it's either on or it's off,
[01:23:34.540 --> 01:23:36.500]   and the neuron's like going up or down.
[01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:41.060]   But sometimes what you can have is these states
[01:23:41.060 --> 01:23:43.720]   where the neuron becomes a little bit more excitable
[01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:45.460]   or less excitable.
[01:23:45.460 --> 01:23:47.700]   And so fMRI is very sensitive
[01:23:47.700 --> 01:23:50.420]   to those changes in excitability.
[01:23:50.420 --> 01:23:54.100]   Actually, one of the fascinating things about fMRI
[01:23:54.100 --> 01:23:58.820]   is where does that, how is it we go from neural activity
[01:23:58.820 --> 01:24:03.820]   to essentially blood flow to oxygen, all this stuff.
[01:24:03.820 --> 01:24:06.900]   It's such a long chain of going from neural activity
[01:24:06.900 --> 01:24:08.580]   to magnetic fields.
[01:24:08.580 --> 01:24:10.380]   And one of the theories that's out there
[01:24:10.380 --> 01:24:14.620]   is most of the cells in the brain are not neurons.
[01:24:14.620 --> 01:24:17.540]   They're actually these support cells called glial cells.
[01:24:17.540 --> 01:24:19.200]   And one big one is astrocytes,
[01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:22.180]   and they play this big role in regulating,
[01:24:22.180 --> 01:24:25.140]   kind of being a middle man, so to speak, with the neurons.
[01:24:25.140 --> 01:24:28.860]   So if you, for instance, one neuron's talking to another,
[01:24:28.860 --> 01:24:31.940]   you release a neurotransmitter, like let's say glutamate,
[01:24:31.940 --> 01:24:33.660]   and that gets another neuron,
[01:24:33.660 --> 01:24:36.900]   starts getting active after you release it
[01:24:36.900 --> 01:24:39.740]   in the gap between the two neurons called synapse.
[01:24:39.740 --> 01:24:43.380]   So what's interesting is if you leave that,
[01:24:43.380 --> 01:24:46.820]   imagine you're just flooded with this liquid in there.
[01:24:46.820 --> 01:24:48.500]   If you leave it in there too long,
[01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:50.440]   you just excite the other neuron too much,
[01:24:50.440 --> 01:24:52.400]   and you can start to basically get seizure activity.
[01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:54.800]   You don't want this, so you gotta suck it up.
[01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:57.880]   And so actually what happens is these astrocytes,
[01:24:57.880 --> 01:25:01.440]   one of their functions is to suck up the glutamate
[01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:04.720]   from the synapse, and that is a massively,
[01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:06.820]   and then break it down and then feed it back
[01:25:06.820 --> 01:25:08.960]   into the neuron so that you can reuse it.
[01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:12.280]   But that cycling is actually very energy-intensive.
[01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:15.440]   And what's interesting is at least according to one theory,
[01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:18.900]   they need to work so quickly that they're working
[01:25:18.900 --> 01:25:21.820]   on metabolizing the glucose that comes in
[01:25:21.820 --> 01:25:26.540]   without using oxygen, kind of like anaerobic metabolism.
[01:25:26.540 --> 01:25:30.140]   So they're not using oxygen as fast
[01:25:30.140 --> 01:25:32.140]   as they are using glucose.
[01:25:32.140 --> 01:25:37.060]   So what we're really seeing in some ways may be in fMRI,
[01:25:37.060 --> 01:25:39.820]   not the neurons themselves being active,
[01:25:39.820 --> 01:25:42.220]   but rather the astrocytes,
[01:25:42.220 --> 01:25:44.380]   which are meeting the metabolic demands
[01:25:44.380 --> 01:25:47.120]   of the process of keeping the whole system going.
[01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:50.800]   - It does seem to be that fMRI is a good way
[01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:52.040]   to study activation.
[01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:57.040]   So with these astrocytes, even though there's a latency,
[01:25:57.040 --> 01:26:01.120]   it's pretty reliably coupled to the activations.
[01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:03.080]   - Oh, well, this gets me to the other part of it.
[01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:05.120]   So now let's say, for instance,
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:06.960]   if I'm just kind of like, I'm talking to you,
[01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:09.120]   but I'm kind of paying attention to your cowboy hat,
[01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:10.240]   right, so I'm looking off to the,
[01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:11.900]   or I'm thinking about the right,
[01:26:11.900 --> 01:26:13.540]   even if I'm not looking at it.
[01:26:13.540 --> 01:26:16.840]   What you'd see is that there'd be this little elevation
[01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:21.520]   in activity in areas in the visual cortex,
[01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:26.520]   which process vision, around that point in space, okay?
[01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:28.960]   So if then something happened,
[01:26:28.960 --> 01:26:32.440]   like all of a sudden a light flashed in that part of,
[01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:34.360]   right in front of your cowboy hat,
[01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:36.880]   I would have a bigger response to it.
[01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:39.160]   But what you see in fMRI is even if I'm not,
[01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:40.800]   even if I don't see that flash of light,
[01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:43.440]   there's a lot of activity that I can measure
[01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:45.460]   because you're kind of keeping it excitable
[01:26:45.460 --> 01:26:46.780]   and that in and of itself,
[01:26:46.780 --> 01:26:49.780]   even though I'm not seeing anything there
[01:26:49.780 --> 01:26:51.540]   that's particularly interesting,
[01:26:51.540 --> 01:26:53.580]   there's still this increase in activity.
[01:26:53.580 --> 01:26:55.420]   And so it's more sensitive with fMRI.
[01:26:55.420 --> 01:26:57.620]   So there, is that a feature or is it a bug?
[01:26:57.620 --> 01:26:58.460]   You know, some people,
[01:26:58.460 --> 01:27:00.900]   people who study spikes in neurons would say,
[01:27:00.900 --> 01:27:03.940]   well, that's terrible, we don't want that, you know?
[01:27:03.940 --> 01:27:07.040]   Likewise, it's slow and that's terrible
[01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:09.740]   for measuring things that are very fast.
[01:27:09.740 --> 01:27:12.260]   But one of the things that we've found in our work
[01:27:12.260 --> 01:27:13.760]   is when we give people movies
[01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:17.320]   and when we give people stories to listen to,
[01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:20.300]   a lot of the action is in the very, very slow stuff.
[01:27:20.300 --> 01:27:23.800]   It's in, because if you're thinking about like a story,
[01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:26.400]   let's say you're listening to a podcast
[01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:29.000]   or you're listening to the Lex Friedman podcast, right?
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:30.680]   You're putting this stuff together
[01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:34.000]   and building this internal model over several seconds,
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.080]   which is basically, we filter that out
[01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:38.440]   when we look at electrical activity in the brain
[01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:40.320]   because we're interested in this millisecond scale.
[01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:43.420]   It's almost massive amounts of information, right?
[01:27:43.420 --> 01:27:46.480]   So the way I see it is every technique
[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:49.980]   gives you a little limited window into what's going on.
[01:27:49.980 --> 01:27:51.500]   fMRI is huge problems.
[01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:53.860]   You know, people lie down in the scanner.
[01:27:53.860 --> 01:27:55.420]   There's parts of the brain where you,
[01:27:55.420 --> 01:27:57.100]   I'll show you in some of these images
[01:27:57.100 --> 01:27:59.380]   where you'll see kind of gaping holes
[01:27:59.380 --> 01:28:03.260]   because there's, you can't keep the magnetic field stable
[01:28:03.260 --> 01:28:04.760]   in those spots.
[01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:06.940]   You'll see parts where it's like there's a vein
[01:28:06.940 --> 01:28:09.260]   and so it just produces big increase
[01:28:09.260 --> 01:28:11.160]   and decrease in signal or respiration
[01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:12.360]   that causes these changes.
[01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:15.280]   There's lots of artifacts and stuff like that, you know.
[01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:17.200]   Every technique has its limits.
[01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:20.120]   If I'm lying down in an MRI scanner, I'm lying down.
[01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:23.400]   I'm not interacting with you in the same way
[01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:25.160]   that I would in the real world.
[01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:27.940]   But at the same time, I'm getting data
[01:28:27.940 --> 01:28:30.320]   that I might not be able to get otherwise.
[01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:31.800]   And so different techniques
[01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:33.480]   give you different kinds of advantages.
[01:28:33.480 --> 01:28:35.880]   - What kind of big scientific discoveries,
[01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:38.160]   maybe the flavor of discoveries have been done
[01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:41.860]   throughout the history of the science of memory,
[01:28:41.860 --> 01:28:43.100]   the studying of memory?
[01:28:43.100 --> 01:28:48.100]   What kind of things have been understood?
[01:28:48.100 --> 01:28:49.700]   - Oh, there's so many.
[01:28:49.700 --> 01:28:52.740]   It's really so hard to summarize it.
[01:28:52.740 --> 01:28:55.220]   I mean, I think it's funny because it's like
[01:28:55.220 --> 01:28:56.260]   when you're in the field,
[01:28:56.260 --> 01:28:58.460]   you can get kind of blase about this stuff.
[01:28:58.460 --> 01:29:00.020]   But then once I started to write the book,
[01:29:00.020 --> 01:29:02.260]   I was like, oh my God, this is really interesting.
[01:29:02.260 --> 01:29:03.720]   How did we do all this stuff?
[01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:09.460]   I would say that some of the,
[01:29:09.460 --> 01:29:11.060]   I mean, from the first studies,
[01:29:11.060 --> 01:29:14.900]   just showing how much we forget is very important.
[01:29:14.900 --> 01:29:16.900]   Showing how much schemas,
[01:29:16.900 --> 01:29:19.500]   which is our organized knowledge about the world,
[01:29:19.500 --> 01:29:23.460]   increase our ability to remember information,
[01:29:23.460 --> 01:29:25.900]   just massively increase it.
[01:29:25.900 --> 01:29:29.980]   Studies of expertise showing how experts like chess experts
[01:29:29.980 --> 01:29:33.080]   can memorize so much in such a short amount of time
[01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:36.260]   because of the schemas they have for chess.
[01:29:36.260 --> 01:29:38.040]   But then also showing that those lead
[01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:40.520]   to all sorts of distortions in memory.
[01:29:40.520 --> 01:29:43.440]   The discovery that the act of remembering
[01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:46.080]   can change the memory, can strengthen it,
[01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:47.840]   but it can also distort it
[01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:50.240]   if you get misinformation at the time.
[01:29:50.240 --> 01:29:53.100]   And it can also strengthen or weaken other memories
[01:29:53.100 --> 01:29:54.880]   that you didn't even recall.
[01:29:54.880 --> 01:29:57.320]   So just this whole idea of memory as an ecosystem,
[01:29:57.320 --> 01:29:58.940]   I think was a big discovery.
[01:29:58.940 --> 01:30:03.440]   I could go, this idea of like breaking up
[01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:07.580]   our continuous experience into these discrete events,
[01:30:07.580 --> 01:30:09.140]   I think was a major discovery.
[01:30:09.140 --> 01:30:11.980]   - So the discreteness of our encoding of events?
[01:30:11.980 --> 01:30:12.820]   - Maybe, yeah.
[01:30:12.820 --> 01:30:13.700]   I mean, you know, and again,
[01:30:13.700 --> 01:30:15.940]   there's controversial ideas about this, right?
[01:30:15.940 --> 01:30:18.140]   But it's like, yeah, this idea that,
[01:30:18.140 --> 01:30:20.900]   and this gets back to just this common experience
[01:30:20.900 --> 01:30:22.980]   of you walk into the kitchen and you're like,
[01:30:22.980 --> 01:30:23.900]   why am I here?
[01:30:23.900 --> 01:30:26.100]   And you just end up grabbing some food from the fridge.
[01:30:26.100 --> 01:30:27.260]   And then you go back and you're like,
[01:30:27.260 --> 01:30:29.420]   oh, wait a minute, I left my watch in the kitchen.
[01:30:29.420 --> 01:30:31.140]   That's what I was looking for.
[01:30:31.140 --> 01:30:33.040]   And so what happens is,
[01:30:33.040 --> 01:30:34.880]   is that you have a little internal model
[01:30:34.880 --> 01:30:37.240]   of where you are, what you're thinking about.
[01:30:37.240 --> 01:30:39.720]   And when you cross from one room to another,
[01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:41.520]   those models get updated.
[01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:42.960]   And so now when you're in the kitchen,
[01:30:42.960 --> 01:30:45.240]   you have to go back and mentally time travel
[01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:47.200]   back to this earlier point
[01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:50.360]   to remember what it was that you went there for.
[01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:51.960]   And so these event boundaries,
[01:30:51.960 --> 01:30:54.120]   turns out like in our research,
[01:30:54.120 --> 01:30:55.280]   and again, I don't wanna make it sound like
[01:30:55.280 --> 01:30:56.600]   we've figured out everything,
[01:30:56.600 --> 01:30:57.480]   but in our research,
[01:30:57.480 --> 01:31:00.260]   one of the things that we found is,
[01:31:00.260 --> 01:31:04.100]   is that basically as people get older,
[01:31:04.100 --> 01:31:07.880]   the activity in the hippocampus at these event boundaries
[01:31:07.880 --> 01:31:09.100]   tends to go down.
[01:31:09.100 --> 01:31:13.140]   But independent of age,
[01:31:13.140 --> 01:31:15.180]   if I give you outside of the scanner,
[01:31:15.180 --> 01:31:16.020]   you're done with the scanner,
[01:31:16.020 --> 01:31:17.660]   I just scan you while you're watching a movie,
[01:31:17.660 --> 01:31:18.840]   you just watch it.
[01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:22.380]   You come out, I give you a test of memory for stories.
[01:31:22.380 --> 01:31:25.940]   What happens is you find this incredible correlation
[01:31:25.940 --> 01:31:28.420]   between the activity in the hippocampus
[01:31:28.420 --> 01:31:32.100]   at these singular points in time, these event boundaries,
[01:31:32.100 --> 01:31:35.180]   and your ability to just remember a story
[01:31:35.180 --> 01:31:36.580]   outside of the scanner later on.
[01:31:36.580 --> 01:31:39.500]   So it's marking this ability to encode memories,
[01:31:39.500 --> 01:31:42.660]   just these little snippets of neural activity.
[01:31:42.660 --> 01:31:44.820]   So I think that's a big one.
[01:31:44.820 --> 01:31:47.540]   There's all sorts of work in animal models
[01:31:47.540 --> 01:31:50.020]   that I can get into, sleep,
[01:31:50.020 --> 01:31:52.080]   I think there's so much interesting stuff
[01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:54.240]   that's being discovered in sleep right now.
[01:31:55.420 --> 01:32:00.420]   Being able to just record from large populations of cells
[01:32:00.420 --> 01:32:02.580]   and then be able to relate that.
[01:32:02.580 --> 01:32:03.980]   You know what I think the coolest thing
[01:32:03.980 --> 01:32:05.780]   gets back to this QR code thing,
[01:32:05.780 --> 01:32:10.780]   because what we can do now is I can take fMRI data
[01:32:10.780 --> 01:32:12.700]   while you're watching a movie.
[01:32:12.700 --> 01:32:14.340]   Or let's do better than that.
[01:32:14.340 --> 01:32:16.700]   Let me get fMRI data while you use a joystick
[01:32:16.700 --> 01:32:18.740]   to move around in virtual reality.
[01:32:18.740 --> 01:32:20.540]   So you're in the metaverse, whatever, right?
[01:32:20.540 --> 01:32:21.980]   But it's kind of a crappy metaverse
[01:32:21.980 --> 01:32:23.340]   'cause there's always so much metaverse
[01:32:23.340 --> 01:32:24.900]   you can do in an MRI scanner.
[01:32:24.900 --> 01:32:27.340]   So you're doing this crappy metaversing.
[01:32:27.340 --> 01:32:32.060]   So now I can take a rat, record from his hippocampus
[01:32:32.060 --> 01:32:34.260]   and prefrontal cortex and all these areas
[01:32:34.260 --> 01:32:35.700]   with these really new electrodes,
[01:32:35.700 --> 01:32:37.700]   you get massive amounts of data,
[01:32:37.700 --> 01:32:42.140]   and have it move around on a trackball in virtual reality
[01:32:42.140 --> 01:32:44.420]   in the same metaverse that I did
[01:32:44.420 --> 01:32:46.380]   and record that rat's activity.
[01:32:46.380 --> 01:32:48.520]   I can get a person with epilepsy
[01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:50.620]   who we have electrodes in their brain anyway
[01:32:50.620 --> 01:32:53.340]   to try to figure out where the seizures are coming from.
[01:32:53.340 --> 01:32:54.580]   And if it's a healthy part of the brain,
[01:32:54.580 --> 01:32:57.140]   record from that person, right?
[01:32:57.140 --> 01:33:00.220]   And I can get a computational model.
[01:33:00.220 --> 01:33:03.500]   And one of the brand new members in my lab,
[01:33:03.500 --> 01:33:05.300]   Tyler Bond, is just doing some great stuff.
[01:33:05.300 --> 01:33:08.420]   He relates computer vision models
[01:33:08.420 --> 01:33:10.620]   and looks at the weaknesses of computer vision models
[01:33:10.620 --> 01:33:12.820]   and relates it to what the brain does well.
[01:33:12.820 --> 01:33:18.100]   And so you can actually take a ground truth
[01:33:20.300 --> 01:33:22.380]   code for the metaverse, basically,
[01:33:22.380 --> 01:33:25.220]   and you can feed in the visual information,
[01:33:25.220 --> 01:33:26.500]   let's say the sensory information
[01:33:26.500 --> 01:33:28.220]   or whatever that's coming in,
[01:33:28.220 --> 01:33:31.300]   to a computational model that's designed
[01:33:31.300 --> 01:33:34.020]   to take real-world inputs, right?
[01:33:34.020 --> 01:33:37.300]   And you could basically tie them all together
[01:33:37.300 --> 01:33:40.520]   by virtue of the state spaces that you're measuring
[01:33:40.520 --> 01:33:43.180]   in neural activity, in these different formats,
[01:33:43.180 --> 01:33:44.340]   in these different species,
[01:33:44.340 --> 01:33:46.140]   and in the computational model,
[01:33:46.140 --> 01:33:48.540]   which I just find that mind-blowing.
[01:33:48.540 --> 01:33:52.340]   You could do different kinds of analyses on language
[01:33:52.340 --> 01:33:54.300]   and basically come up with just like,
[01:33:54.300 --> 01:33:56.540]   basically, it's the guts of LLMs, right?
[01:33:56.540 --> 01:34:00.860]   You could do analyses on language
[01:34:00.860 --> 01:34:04.660]   and you could do analyses on sentiment analyses
[01:34:04.660 --> 01:34:05.860]   of emotions and so forth.
[01:34:05.860 --> 01:34:07.980]   Put all this stuff together.
[01:34:07.980 --> 01:34:10.260]   I mean, it's almost too much.
[01:34:10.260 --> 01:34:14.460]   But if you do it right and you do it in a theory-driven way,
[01:34:14.460 --> 01:34:16.780]   as opposed to just throwing all the data at the wall
[01:34:16.780 --> 01:34:17.740]   and see what sticks,
[01:34:17.740 --> 01:34:20.660]   I mean, that to me is just exceptionally powerful.
[01:34:20.660 --> 01:34:25.260]   - So you can take fMRI data across species
[01:34:25.260 --> 01:34:27.300]   and across different types of humans
[01:34:27.300 --> 01:34:30.180]   or conditions of humans and what find,
[01:34:30.180 --> 01:34:36.220]   construct models that help you find the commonalities
[01:34:36.220 --> 01:34:39.780]   or like the core thing that makes somebody navigate
[01:34:39.780 --> 01:34:41.340]   through the metaverse, for example?
[01:34:41.340 --> 01:34:42.860]   - Yeah, yeah, I mean, more or less.
[01:34:42.860 --> 01:34:45.100]   I mean, there's a lot of details, but yes.
[01:34:45.100 --> 01:34:46.660]   I think, and not just fMRI,
[01:34:46.660 --> 01:34:48.820]   but you can relate it to, like I said,
[01:34:48.820 --> 01:34:51.780]   recordings from large populations of neurons
[01:34:51.780 --> 01:34:53.020]   that could be taken in a human
[01:34:53.020 --> 01:34:55.860]   or even in a non-human animal
[01:34:55.860 --> 01:35:00.580]   that is where you think it's an anatomical homologue.
[01:35:00.580 --> 01:35:02.980]   So that's just mind-blowing to me.
[01:35:02.980 --> 01:35:06.420]   - What's the similarities in humans and mice?
[01:35:06.420 --> 01:35:08.140]   (Lex laughing)
[01:35:08.140 --> 01:35:10.460]   That's what smashing pumpkins,
[01:35:10.460 --> 01:35:12.220]   we're all just rats in a cage.
[01:35:12.220 --> 01:35:13.740]   Is that smashing pumpkins?
[01:35:13.740 --> 01:35:15.660]   - Despite all of your rage.
[01:35:15.660 --> 01:35:17.340]   - Is that smashing pumpkins, I think?
[01:35:17.340 --> 01:35:19.380]   - Despite all of your rage at GIFs,
[01:35:19.380 --> 01:35:21.260]   you're still just a rat in a cage.
[01:35:21.260 --> 01:35:22.100]   (Lex laughing)
[01:35:22.100 --> 01:35:22.940]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:35:22.940 --> 01:35:23.760]   All right, good callback.
[01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:24.600]   - Good callback.
[01:35:24.600 --> 01:35:26.860]   See, these memory retrieval exercises I'm doing
[01:35:26.860 --> 01:35:28.860]   are actually helping you build
[01:35:28.860 --> 01:35:31.420]   a lasting memory of this conversation.
[01:35:31.420 --> 01:35:34.940]   - And it's strengthening the visual thing I have of you
[01:35:34.940 --> 01:35:36.260]   with James Brown on stage.
[01:35:36.260 --> 01:35:37.100]   (Lex laughing)
[01:35:37.100 --> 01:35:40.380]   It's just becoming stronger and stronger by the second.
[01:35:40.380 --> 01:35:41.780]   But anyway. - It's hot.
[01:35:41.780 --> 01:35:42.780]   (both laughing)
[01:35:42.780 --> 01:35:45.100]   - But animal studies work here as well?
[01:35:45.100 --> 01:35:45.940]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:35:45.940 --> 01:35:47.900]   So, okay, so let's go to the...
[01:35:47.900 --> 01:35:52.620]   So, I think, I've got great colleagues who I talk to
[01:35:52.620 --> 01:35:55.100]   who study memory in mice.
[01:35:55.100 --> 01:35:56.060]   And there's some,
[01:35:56.060 --> 01:35:59.420]   one of the valuable things in those models
[01:35:59.420 --> 01:36:01.760]   is you can study neural circuits
[01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:03.380]   in an enormously targeted way
[01:36:03.380 --> 01:36:06.340]   because you could do these genetic studies, for instance,
[01:36:06.340 --> 01:36:10.540]   where you can manipulate particular groups of neurons.
[01:36:10.540 --> 01:36:12.460]   And it's just getting more and more targeted
[01:36:12.460 --> 01:36:15.460]   to the point where you can actually turn on
[01:36:15.460 --> 01:36:17.700]   particular kind of memory
[01:36:17.700 --> 01:36:20.820]   just by activating a particular set of neurons
[01:36:20.820 --> 01:36:23.380]   that was active during an experience, right?
[01:36:23.380 --> 01:36:27.140]   So, there's a lot of conservation
[01:36:27.140 --> 01:36:28.780]   of some of these neural circuits
[01:36:28.780 --> 01:36:33.140]   across evolution in mammals, for instance.
[01:36:33.140 --> 01:36:35.260]   And then some people would even say
[01:36:35.260 --> 01:36:37.180]   that there's genetic mechanisms for learning
[01:36:37.180 --> 01:36:40.900]   that are conserved even going back far, far before.
[01:36:40.900 --> 01:36:44.740]   But let's go back to the mice and humans question, right?
[01:36:44.740 --> 01:36:45.940]   There's a lot of differences.
[01:36:45.940 --> 01:36:46.860]   So, for one thing,
[01:36:46.860 --> 01:36:49.260]   the sensory information is very different.
[01:36:49.260 --> 01:36:52.340]   Mice and rats explore the world
[01:36:52.340 --> 01:36:56.460]   largely through smelling, olfaction.
[01:36:56.460 --> 01:36:57.660]   But they also have vision
[01:36:57.660 --> 01:37:00.260]   that's kind of designed to kind of catch death from above.
[01:37:00.260 --> 01:37:02.900]   So, it's like a very big view of the world.
[01:37:02.900 --> 01:37:05.040]   And we move our eyes around
[01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:08.380]   in a way that focuses on particular spots in space
[01:37:08.380 --> 01:37:10.260]   where you get very high resolution
[01:37:10.260 --> 01:37:12.540]   from a very limited set of spots in space.
[01:37:12.540 --> 01:37:15.820]   So, that makes us very different in that way.
[01:37:15.820 --> 01:37:18.780]   We also have all these other structures as social animals
[01:37:18.780 --> 01:37:22.580]   that allow us to respond differently.
[01:37:22.580 --> 01:37:26.140]   There's language, there's like, you know, so you name it,
[01:37:26.140 --> 01:37:28.060]   there's obviously gobs of differences.
[01:37:28.060 --> 01:37:29.540]   Humans aren't just giant rats.
[01:37:29.540 --> 01:37:30.980]   There's much more complexity to us.
[01:37:30.980 --> 01:37:32.940]   Time scales are very important.
[01:37:32.940 --> 01:37:35.900]   So, primate brains and human brains
[01:37:35.900 --> 01:37:38.620]   are especially good at integrating
[01:37:38.620 --> 01:37:41.300]   and holding on to information
[01:37:41.300 --> 01:37:44.340]   across longer and longer periods of time, right?
[01:37:44.340 --> 01:37:46.260]   And also, you know, finally,
[01:37:46.260 --> 01:37:48.980]   it's like our history of training data, so to speak,
[01:37:48.980 --> 01:37:51.260]   is very, very different than, you know,
[01:37:51.260 --> 01:37:53.860]   I mean, a human's world is very different
[01:37:53.860 --> 01:37:56.620]   than a wild mouse's world.
[01:37:56.620 --> 01:37:59.740]   And a lab mouse's world is extraordinarily impoverished
[01:37:59.740 --> 01:38:01.780]   relative to an adult human, you know?
[01:38:01.780 --> 01:38:03.820]   - But still, what can you understand by studying mice?
[01:38:03.820 --> 01:38:07.460]   I mean, just basic, almost behavioral stuff about memory?
[01:38:07.460 --> 01:38:10.260]   - Well, yes, but that's very important, right?
[01:38:10.260 --> 01:38:12.540]   So, you can understand, for instance,
[01:38:12.540 --> 01:38:14.780]   how do neurons talk to each other?
[01:38:14.780 --> 01:38:17.580]   That's a really big, big question.
[01:38:17.580 --> 01:38:19.700]   Neural computation, in and of itself,
[01:38:19.700 --> 01:38:22.180]   you'd think it's the most simple question, right?
[01:38:22.180 --> 01:38:23.020]   Not at all.
[01:38:23.020 --> 01:38:25.180]   I mean, it's a big, big question.
[01:38:25.180 --> 01:38:30.180]   And understanding how two parts of the brain interact,
[01:38:30.180 --> 01:38:33.020]   meaning that it's not just one area speaking.
[01:38:33.020 --> 01:38:35.140]   It's not like, you know, it's not like Twitter,
[01:38:35.140 --> 01:38:36.940]   where one area of the brain is shouting,
[01:38:36.940 --> 01:38:38.380]   and then another area of the brain's
[01:38:38.380 --> 01:38:40.220]   just stuck listening to this crap.
[01:38:40.220 --> 01:38:42.220]   It's like they're actually interacting
[01:38:42.220 --> 01:38:43.900]   on a millisecond scale, right?
[01:38:43.900 --> 01:38:45.340]   How does that happen?
[01:38:45.340 --> 01:38:47.540]   And how do you regulate those interactions,
[01:38:47.540 --> 01:38:50.500]   these dynamic, you know, interactions?
[01:38:50.500 --> 01:38:51.780]   We're still figuring that out,
[01:38:51.780 --> 01:38:54.740]   but that's gonna be coming largely from model systems
[01:38:54.740 --> 01:38:57.660]   that are easier to understand.
[01:38:57.660 --> 01:39:00.620]   You can do manipulations, like drug manipulations,
[01:39:00.620 --> 01:39:03.260]   to manipulate circuits and, you know,
[01:39:03.260 --> 01:39:06.620]   use viruses and so forth and lasers to turn on circuits
[01:39:06.620 --> 01:39:08.900]   that you just can't do in humans.
[01:39:08.900 --> 01:39:11.940]   So I think there's a lot that can be learned from mice.
[01:39:11.940 --> 01:39:14.740]   There's a lot that can be learned from non-human primates.
[01:39:14.740 --> 01:39:17.340]   And there's a lot that you need to learn from humans.
[01:39:17.340 --> 01:39:19.380]   And I think, unfortunately,
[01:39:19.380 --> 01:39:22.580]   some of the people in the National Institutes of Health
[01:39:22.580 --> 01:39:24.540]   think you can learn everything from the mouse.
[01:39:24.540 --> 01:39:26.780]   It's like, why study memory in humans
[01:39:26.780 --> 01:39:28.300]   when I could study learning in a mouse?
[01:39:28.300 --> 01:39:30.060]   And just like, oh my God,
[01:39:30.060 --> 01:39:32.220]   I'm gonna get my funding from somewhere else.
[01:39:32.220 --> 01:39:34.140]   So... (laughs)
[01:39:34.140 --> 01:39:36.180]   - Well, let me ask you some random fascinating questions.
[01:39:36.180 --> 01:39:37.020]   - Yeah, sure.
[01:39:37.020 --> 01:39:40.860]   - How does deja vu work?
[01:39:40.860 --> 01:39:44.940]   - So deja vu is, it's actually,
[01:39:44.940 --> 01:39:47.660]   one of these things I think that some of the surveys
[01:39:47.660 --> 01:39:50.620]   suggest that like 75% of people report
[01:39:50.620 --> 01:39:53.340]   having a deja vu experience one time or another.
[01:39:53.340 --> 01:39:54.540]   I don't know where that came from,
[01:39:54.540 --> 01:39:56.860]   but I've polled people in my class
[01:39:56.860 --> 01:40:00.260]   and most of them say they've experienced deja vu.
[01:40:00.260 --> 01:40:01.420]   It's this kind of sense
[01:40:01.420 --> 01:40:04.260]   that I've experienced this moment sometime before,
[01:40:04.260 --> 01:40:06.060]   I've been here before.
[01:40:06.060 --> 01:40:08.620]   And actually, there's all sorts of variants of this.
[01:40:08.620 --> 01:40:10.020]   The French have all sorts of names
[01:40:10.020 --> 01:40:13.100]   for various versions of the chamois vu,
[01:40:13.100 --> 01:40:15.820]   parley vu, I don't know. (laughs)
[01:40:15.820 --> 01:40:17.380]   All these different vus.
[01:40:17.380 --> 01:40:22.260]   But deja vu is the sense that it can be like
[01:40:22.260 --> 01:40:25.220]   almost disturbing, intense sense of familiarity.
[01:40:26.100 --> 01:40:29.820]   So there is a researcher named Wilder Penfield.
[01:40:29.820 --> 01:40:31.420]   Actually, this goes back even earlier
[01:40:31.420 --> 01:40:32.700]   to some of the earliest,
[01:40:32.700 --> 01:40:35.260]   like Hughlings Jackson was this neurologist
[01:40:35.260 --> 01:40:39.460]   who did a lot of the early characterizations of epilepsy.
[01:40:39.460 --> 01:40:42.620]   And one of the things he notices in epilepsy patients,
[01:40:42.620 --> 01:40:45.940]   some group of them, right before they would get a seizure,
[01:40:45.940 --> 01:40:49.140]   they would have this intense sense of deja vu.
[01:40:49.140 --> 01:40:52.980]   So it's this artificial sense of familiarity.
[01:40:52.980 --> 01:40:57.860]   It's a sense of having a memory that's not there, right?
[01:40:57.860 --> 01:41:01.100]   And so what was happening was there's electrical activity
[01:41:01.100 --> 01:41:02.260]   in certain parts of these brains.
[01:41:02.260 --> 01:41:04.260]   So this guy Penfield later on,
[01:41:04.260 --> 01:41:07.220]   when he was trying to look for
[01:41:07.220 --> 01:41:09.740]   how do we map out the brain to figure out
[01:41:09.740 --> 01:41:12.540]   which parts we wanna remove and which parts don't we,
[01:41:12.540 --> 01:41:15.260]   he would stimulate parts of the temporal lobes of the brain
[01:41:15.260 --> 01:41:17.740]   and find you could elicit the sense of deja vu.
[01:41:17.740 --> 01:41:19.740]   Sometimes you'd actually get a memory
[01:41:19.740 --> 01:41:21.020]   that a person would re-experience
[01:41:21.100 --> 01:41:23.940]   just from electrically stimulating some parts.
[01:41:23.940 --> 01:41:26.620]   Sometimes though, they just have this intense feeling
[01:41:26.620 --> 01:41:28.020]   of being somewhere before.
[01:41:28.020 --> 01:41:32.100]   And so one theory which I really like is,
[01:41:32.100 --> 01:41:35.180]   is that in higher order areas of the brain,
[01:41:35.180 --> 01:41:38.220]   they're integrating for many, many different
[01:41:38.220 --> 01:41:39.820]   sources of input.
[01:41:39.820 --> 01:41:43.860]   What happens is is that they're tuning themselves up
[01:41:43.860 --> 01:41:47.260]   every time you process a similar input, right?
[01:41:47.260 --> 01:41:50.120]   And so that allows you to just get
[01:41:50.120 --> 01:41:53.340]   this kind of a fluent sense that I'm very familiar,
[01:41:53.340 --> 01:41:55.380]   you're very familiar with this place, right?
[01:41:55.380 --> 01:41:57.180]   And so just being here,
[01:41:57.180 --> 01:41:59.740]   you're not going to be moving your eyes all over the place
[01:41:59.740 --> 01:42:01.740]   'cause you kind of have an idea of where everything is.
[01:42:01.740 --> 01:42:04.660]   And that fluency gives you a sense of like, I'm here.
[01:42:04.660 --> 01:42:06.660]   Now I wake up in my hotel room
[01:42:06.660 --> 01:42:10.580]   and I have this very unfamiliar sense of where I am, right?
[01:42:10.580 --> 01:42:13.780]   But there's a great set of studies done by Ann Cleary
[01:42:13.780 --> 01:42:15.220]   at Colorado State,
[01:42:15.220 --> 01:42:17.740]   where she created these virtual reality environments.
[01:42:17.740 --> 01:42:19.740]   And we'll go back to the metaverse.
[01:42:19.740 --> 01:42:23.780]   Imagine you go through a virtual museum, right?
[01:42:23.780 --> 01:42:25.940]   And then she would put people in virtual reality
[01:42:25.940 --> 01:42:29.460]   and have them go through a virtual arcade.
[01:42:29.460 --> 01:42:32.300]   But the map of the two places was exactly the same.
[01:42:32.300 --> 01:42:34.020]   She just put different skins on them.
[01:42:34.020 --> 01:42:35.700]   So one looks different than the other,
[01:42:35.700 --> 01:42:38.260]   but they've got same landmarks and the same places,
[01:42:38.260 --> 01:42:39.420]   same objects and everything,
[01:42:39.420 --> 01:42:43.000]   but carpeting, colors, theme, everything's different.
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:46.700]   People will often not have any conscious idea
[01:42:46.700 --> 01:42:48.340]   that the two are the same,
[01:42:48.340 --> 01:42:52.140]   but they could report this very intense sense of deja vu.
[01:42:52.140 --> 01:42:53.740]   So it's like a partial match
[01:42:53.740 --> 01:42:56.980]   that's eliciting this kind of a sense of familiarity.
[01:42:56.980 --> 01:43:01.140]   And that's why in patients who have epilepsy
[01:43:01.140 --> 01:43:02.540]   that affects memory,
[01:43:02.540 --> 01:43:06.420]   you get this artificial sense of familiarity that happens.
[01:43:06.420 --> 01:43:08.060]   And so we think that,
[01:43:08.060 --> 01:43:10.660]   and again, this is just one theory amongst many,
[01:43:10.660 --> 01:43:14.340]   but we think that we get a little bit of that feeling.
[01:43:14.340 --> 01:43:17.660]   It's not enough to necessarily give you deja vu,
[01:43:17.660 --> 01:43:20.540]   even for very mundane things, right?
[01:43:20.540 --> 01:43:24.580]   So it's like if I tell you the word rutabaga,
[01:43:24.580 --> 01:43:27.040]   your brain's gonna work a little bit harder to catch it
[01:43:27.040 --> 01:43:30.180]   than if I give you a word like apple, right?
[01:43:30.180 --> 01:43:32.100]   And that's 'cause you hear apple lots.
[01:43:32.100 --> 01:43:34.500]   Your brain's very tuned up to process it efficiently,
[01:43:34.500 --> 01:43:37.300]   but rutabaga takes a little bit longer and more intense.
[01:43:37.300 --> 01:43:40.580]   And you can actually see a difference in brain activity
[01:43:40.580 --> 01:43:42.820]   in areas in the temporal lobe when you hear a word
[01:43:42.820 --> 01:43:46.400]   just based on how frequent it is in the English language.
[01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:49.840]   So we think it's tied to this basic,
[01:43:49.840 --> 01:43:53.060]   it's basically a by-product of our mechanism
[01:43:53.060 --> 01:43:55.960]   of just learning, doing this error-driven learning
[01:43:55.960 --> 01:43:58.620]   as we go through life to become better and better and better
[01:43:58.620 --> 01:44:00.860]   to process things more and more efficiently.
[01:44:00.860 --> 01:44:04.340]   - So I guess deja vu is just thinking extra elevated,
[01:44:04.340 --> 01:44:06.680]   the stuff coming together,
[01:44:06.680 --> 01:44:10.780]   firing for this artificial memory as if it's the real memory.
[01:44:10.780 --> 01:44:15.220]   I mean, why does it feel so intense?
[01:44:15.220 --> 01:44:16.800]   - Well, it doesn't happen all the time,
[01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:20.280]   but I think what may be happening is it's such a,
[01:44:20.280 --> 01:44:22.960]   it's a partial match to something that we have,
[01:44:22.960 --> 01:44:25.580]   and it's not enough to trigger that sense of,
[01:44:25.580 --> 01:44:28.760]   you know, that ability to pull together all the pieces,
[01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:30.920]   but it's a close enough match to give you
[01:44:30.920 --> 01:44:33.360]   that intense sense of familiarity
[01:44:33.360 --> 01:44:36.980]   without the recollection of exactly what happened when.
[01:44:36.980 --> 01:44:41.240]   - But it's also like a spatiotemporal familiarity.
[01:44:41.240 --> 01:44:43.240]   So like, it's also in time.
[01:44:43.240 --> 01:44:46.660]   Like, there's a weird blending of time that happens.
[01:44:46.660 --> 01:44:49.080]   And we'll probably talk about time,
[01:44:49.080 --> 01:44:50.720]   'cause I think that's a really interesting idea,
[01:44:50.720 --> 01:44:52.420]   how time relates to memory.
[01:44:52.420 --> 01:44:57.420]   But you also kind of, artificial memory brings to mind
[01:44:57.420 --> 01:45:00.480]   this idea of false memories
[01:45:00.480 --> 01:45:02.740]   that comes in all kinds of contexts,
[01:45:02.740 --> 01:45:05.860]   but how do false memories form?
[01:45:05.860 --> 01:45:08.160]   - Well, I like to say there's no such thing
[01:45:08.160 --> 01:45:10.200]   as true or false memories, right?
[01:45:10.200 --> 01:45:13.120]   It's like Johnny Rotten from the Sex Pistols,
[01:45:13.120 --> 01:45:13.960]   he had a saying that's like,
[01:45:13.960 --> 01:45:15.440]   "I don't believe in false memories
[01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:18.120]   "any more than I believe in false songs," right?
[01:45:18.120 --> 01:45:21.720]   It's like, and so the basic idea is that
[01:45:21.720 --> 01:45:24.420]   we have these memories that reflect bits and pieces
[01:45:24.420 --> 01:45:28.240]   of what happened, as well as our inferences and theories,
[01:45:28.240 --> 01:45:30.920]   right, so I'm a scientist and I collect data,
[01:45:30.920 --> 01:45:34.880]   but I use theories to make sense of that data.
[01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:38.260]   And so a memory is kind of a mix of all these things.
[01:45:38.260 --> 01:45:40.400]   So where memories can go off the deep end
[01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:42.320]   and become what we would call conventionally
[01:45:42.320 --> 01:45:47.320]   as false memories, are sometimes little distortions
[01:45:47.320 --> 01:45:50.880]   where we filled in the blanks, the gaps in our memory,
[01:45:50.880 --> 01:45:52.840]   based on things that we know,
[01:45:52.840 --> 01:45:55.780]   but don't actually correspond to what happened, right?
[01:45:55.780 --> 01:46:02.520]   So if I were to tell you that I'm like, you know,
[01:46:02.520 --> 01:46:05.800]   a story about this person who's like,
[01:46:05.800 --> 01:46:08.680]   worried that they have cancer or something like that,
[01:46:08.680 --> 01:46:11.560]   and then, you know, they see a doctor and the doctor says,
[01:46:11.560 --> 01:46:14.520]   "Well, things are very much like you would have expected,"
[01:46:14.520 --> 01:46:17.280]   or like, you know, "what you were afraid of," or something.
[01:46:17.280 --> 01:46:19.200]   When people remember that, they'll often remember,
[01:46:19.200 --> 01:46:23.120]   "Well, the doctor told the patient that he had cancer,"
[01:46:23.120 --> 01:46:24.560]   even if that wasn't in the story,
[01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:27.840]   because they're infusing meaning into that story, right?
[01:46:27.840 --> 01:46:29.960]   So that's a minor distortion.
[01:46:29.960 --> 01:46:32.000]   But what happens is, is that sometimes things
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:35.800]   can really get out of hand where people have trouble
[01:46:35.800 --> 01:46:37.960]   telling the difference in things that they've imagined
[01:46:37.960 --> 01:46:41.040]   versus things that happen, but also, as I told you,
[01:46:41.040 --> 01:46:44.920]   the act of remembering can change the memory.
[01:46:44.920 --> 01:46:48.800]   And so what happens then is you can actually be exposed
[01:46:48.800 --> 01:46:50.160]   to some misinformation.
[01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:53.320]   And so Elizabeth Loftus was a real pioneer in this work,
[01:46:53.320 --> 01:46:56.560]   and there's lots of other work that's been done since.
[01:46:56.560 --> 01:47:00.120]   But basically, it's like, if you remember some event,
[01:47:00.120 --> 01:47:03.100]   and then I tell you something about the event,
[01:47:03.100 --> 01:47:05.880]   later on, when you remember the event,
[01:47:05.880 --> 01:47:08.040]   you might remember some original information
[01:47:08.040 --> 01:47:10.980]   from the event, as well as some information
[01:47:10.980 --> 01:47:12.480]   about what I told you.
[01:47:12.480 --> 01:47:16.060]   And sometimes, if you're not able to tell the difference,
[01:47:16.060 --> 01:47:18.200]   that information that I told you gets mixed
[01:47:18.200 --> 01:47:20.640]   into the story that you had originally.
[01:47:20.640 --> 01:47:23.040]   So now, I give you some more misinformation,
[01:47:23.040 --> 01:47:25.640]   or you're exposed to some more information somewhere else,
[01:47:25.640 --> 01:47:28.640]   and eventually, your memory becomes totally detached
[01:47:28.640 --> 01:47:30.000]   from what happened.
[01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:33.800]   And so sometimes you can have cases where people,
[01:47:33.800 --> 01:47:37.480]   this is very rare, but you can do it in lab, too,
[01:47:37.480 --> 01:47:40.700]   where a significant, not everybody,
[01:47:40.700 --> 01:47:43.580]   but a chunk of people will fall for this,
[01:47:43.580 --> 01:47:46.980]   where you can give people misinformation
[01:47:46.980 --> 01:47:49.820]   about an event that never took place.
[01:47:49.820 --> 01:47:53.140]   And as they keep trying to remember that event more and more,
[01:47:53.140 --> 01:47:54.620]   what happens is they start to imagine,
[01:47:54.620 --> 01:47:56.140]   they start to pull up things
[01:47:56.140 --> 01:47:58.220]   from other experiences they've had,
[01:47:58.220 --> 01:48:01.800]   and eventually, they can stitch together a vivid memory
[01:48:01.800 --> 01:48:03.940]   of something that never happened.
[01:48:03.940 --> 01:48:07.300]   Because they're not remembering an event that happened,
[01:48:07.300 --> 01:48:09.400]   they're remembering the act
[01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:11.800]   of trying to remember what happened,
[01:48:11.800 --> 01:48:14.920]   and basically putting it together into the wrong story.
[01:48:14.920 --> 01:48:17.920]   - So it's fascinating, 'cause this could probably happen
[01:48:17.920 --> 01:48:21.560]   at a collective level.
[01:48:21.560 --> 01:48:23.400]   Like, this is probably what successful
[01:48:23.400 --> 01:48:25.640]   propaganda machines aim to do,
[01:48:25.640 --> 01:48:28.600]   is creating false memory across thousands,
[01:48:28.600 --> 01:48:30.320]   if not millions, of minds.
[01:48:30.320 --> 01:48:31.940]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:48:31.940 --> 01:48:34.480]   I mean, this is exactly what they do.
[01:48:34.480 --> 01:48:37.740]   And so, all these kind of foibles of human memory
[01:48:37.740 --> 01:48:40.520]   get magnified when you start to have social interactions.
[01:48:40.520 --> 01:48:41.800]   There's a whole literature
[01:48:41.800 --> 01:48:44.280]   on something called social contagion,
[01:48:44.280 --> 01:48:47.800]   which is basically when misinformation spreads like a virus.
[01:48:47.800 --> 01:48:51.040]   Like, you remember the same thing that I did,
[01:48:51.040 --> 01:48:53.400]   but I give you a little bit of wrong information,
[01:48:53.400 --> 01:48:56.560]   then that becomes part of your story of what happened.
[01:48:56.560 --> 01:48:59.260]   Because once you and I share a memory,
[01:48:59.260 --> 01:49:01.240]   like I tell you about something I've experienced,
[01:49:01.240 --> 01:49:04.080]   and you tell me about your experience of the same event,
[01:49:04.080 --> 01:49:07.560]   it's no longer your memory or my memory, it's our memory.
[01:49:07.560 --> 01:49:10.200]   And so, now the misinformation spreads.
[01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:12.040]   And the more you trust someone,
[01:49:12.040 --> 01:49:14.600]   or the more powerful that person is,
[01:49:14.600 --> 01:49:18.040]   the more of a voice they have in shaping that narrative.
[01:49:18.040 --> 01:49:21.640]   And there's all sorts of interesting ways
[01:49:21.640 --> 01:49:23.040]   in which misinformation can happen.
[01:49:23.040 --> 01:49:27.000]   There's a great example of when John McCain
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:32.000]   and George Bush Jr. were in a primary,
[01:49:32.080 --> 01:49:35.440]   and there were these polls where they would do these,
[01:49:35.440 --> 01:49:37.600]   like, I guess they were like not robocalls,
[01:49:37.600 --> 01:49:40.240]   but real calls where they would poll voters.
[01:49:40.240 --> 01:49:43.760]   But they actually inserted some misinformation
[01:49:43.760 --> 01:49:46.560]   about McCain's beliefs on taxation, I think,
[01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:48.520]   and maybe it was something about illegitimate children.
[01:49:48.520 --> 01:49:49.920]   I don't really remember.
[01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:52.120]   But they included misinformation
[01:49:52.120 --> 01:49:53.720]   in the question that they asked.
[01:49:53.720 --> 01:49:56.480]   Like, how do you feel about the fact
[01:49:56.480 --> 01:49:58.600]   that he wants to do this or something?
[01:49:58.600 --> 01:50:01.240]   And so, people would end up becoming convinced
[01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:05.000]   he had these policy things or these personal things
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.400]   that were not true, just based on the polls
[01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:08.560]   that were being used.
[01:50:08.560 --> 01:50:12.360]   So, it was a case where, interestingly enough,
[01:50:12.360 --> 01:50:16.240]   the people who were using misinformation
[01:50:16.240 --> 01:50:18.080]   were actually ahead of the curve
[01:50:18.080 --> 01:50:19.760]   relative to the scientists who were trying
[01:50:19.760 --> 01:50:21.520]   to study these effects in memory.
[01:50:21.520 --> 01:50:26.720]   - Yeah, it's really interesting.
[01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:29.360]   So, it's not just about truth and falsehoods,
[01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:34.360]   like us as intelligent reasoning machines,
[01:50:34.360 --> 01:50:37.680]   but it's the formation of memories
[01:50:37.680 --> 01:50:39.680]   where they become, like, visceral.
[01:50:39.680 --> 01:50:41.400]   You can rewrite history.
[01:50:41.400 --> 01:50:44.000]   If you just look throughout the 20th century,
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:47.600]   some of the dictatorships with Nazi Germany,
[01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:52.320]   with the Soviet Union, effective propaganda machines
[01:50:52.320 --> 01:50:55.080]   can rewrite our conceptions of history,
[01:50:55.080 --> 01:50:56.600]   how we remember our own culture,
[01:50:56.600 --> 01:50:58.280]   our upbringing, all this kind of stuff.
[01:50:59.120 --> 01:51:01.160]   You could do quite a lot of damage in this way.
[01:51:01.160 --> 01:51:02.560]   And then, there's probably some kind
[01:51:02.560 --> 01:51:05.120]   of social contagion happening there.
[01:51:05.120 --> 01:51:10.440]   Like, certain ideas that may be initiated
[01:51:10.440 --> 01:51:13.200]   by the propaganda machine can spread faster than others.
[01:51:13.200 --> 01:51:15.040]   You could see that in modern day,
[01:51:15.040 --> 01:51:17.080]   certain conspiracy theories,
[01:51:17.080 --> 01:51:18.280]   there's just something about them
[01:51:18.280 --> 01:51:20.800]   that they are, like, really effective at spreading.
[01:51:20.800 --> 01:51:24.360]   There's something sexy about them to people,
[01:51:24.360 --> 01:51:28.560]   to where something about the human mind eats it up
[01:51:28.560 --> 01:51:31.800]   and then uses that to construct memories
[01:51:31.800 --> 01:51:35.600]   as if they almost were there to witness
[01:51:35.600 --> 01:51:38.240]   whatever the content of the conspiracy theory is.
[01:51:38.240 --> 01:51:40.000]   It's fascinating, 'cause once you feel
[01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:44.040]   like you remember a thing, I feel like there's a certainty.
[01:51:44.040 --> 01:51:47.640]   There's a, it emboldens you to, like, say stuff.
[01:51:47.640 --> 01:51:51.080]   Like, you really, like, it's not just you believe
[01:51:51.080 --> 01:51:53.520]   an idea's true or not, you're like,
[01:51:53.520 --> 01:51:57.760]   it's at the core of your being that you,
[01:51:57.760 --> 01:52:00.880]   you feel like you were there to watch the thing happen.
[01:52:00.880 --> 01:52:03.880]   - Yeah, I mean, there's so much in what you're saying.
[01:52:03.880 --> 01:52:07.160]   I mean, one of the things is that people's sense
[01:52:07.160 --> 01:52:11.720]   of collective identity is very much tied to shared memories.
[01:52:11.720 --> 01:52:13.920]   If we have a shared narrative of the past,
[01:52:13.920 --> 01:52:16.220]   or even better, if we have a shared past,
[01:52:16.220 --> 01:52:19.000]   we will feel more socially connected with each other,
[01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:20.660]   and I will feel part of this group.
[01:52:20.660 --> 01:52:23.540]   They're part of my tribe if I remember the same things
[01:52:23.540 --> 01:52:24.820]   in the same way.
[01:52:24.820 --> 01:52:27.460]   And you brought up this weaponization of history,
[01:52:27.460 --> 01:52:29.660]   and, you know, it really speaks to, I think,
[01:52:29.660 --> 01:52:31.900]   one of the parts of memory, which is that
[01:52:31.900 --> 01:52:35.780]   if you have a belief, you will find,
[01:52:35.780 --> 01:52:39.040]   and you have a goal in mind, you will find stuff in memory
[01:52:39.040 --> 01:52:41.660]   that aligns with it, and you won't see the parts
[01:52:41.660 --> 01:52:43.140]   in memory that don't.
[01:52:43.140 --> 01:52:44.980]   So a lot of the stories we put together
[01:52:44.980 --> 01:52:47.740]   are based on our perspectives, right?
[01:52:47.740 --> 01:52:51.340]   And so let's just zoom out for the moment
[01:52:51.340 --> 01:52:55.620]   from misinformation, take something even more fascinating,
[01:52:55.620 --> 01:52:57.780]   but not as scary.
[01:52:57.780 --> 01:53:01.260]   I was reading Thanh Viet Nguyen,
[01:53:01.260 --> 01:53:04.260]   but he wrote a book about the collective memory
[01:53:04.260 --> 01:53:05.220]   of the Vietnam War.
[01:53:05.220 --> 01:53:08.500]   He's a Vietnamese immigrant who was flown out
[01:53:08.500 --> 01:53:11.460]   as after the war was over, and so he went back
[01:53:11.460 --> 01:53:14.660]   to his family to get their stories about the war,
[01:53:14.660 --> 01:53:17.500]   and they called it the American War,
[01:53:17.500 --> 01:53:19.780]   not the Vietnam War, right?
[01:53:19.780 --> 01:53:22.540]   And that just kind of blew my mind,
[01:53:22.540 --> 01:53:25.180]   having grown up in the US, and I've always heard about it
[01:53:25.180 --> 01:53:26.980]   as the Vietnam War, but of course they call it
[01:53:26.980 --> 01:53:28.580]   the American War, 'cause that's what happened.
[01:53:28.580 --> 01:53:30.300]   America came in, right?
[01:53:30.300 --> 01:53:32.620]   And that's based on their perspective,
[01:53:32.620 --> 01:53:35.800]   which is a very valid perspective.
[01:53:35.800 --> 01:53:39.700]   And so that just gives you this idea
[01:53:39.700 --> 01:53:42.200]   of the way we put together these narratives
[01:53:42.200 --> 01:53:44.020]   based on our perspectives.
[01:53:44.020 --> 01:53:49.020]   And I think the opportunities that we can have in memory
[01:53:49.020 --> 01:53:54.220]   is if we bring groups together from different perspectives
[01:53:54.220 --> 01:53:56.420]   and we allow them to talk to each other
[01:53:56.420 --> 01:53:58.140]   and we allow ourselves to listen.
[01:53:58.140 --> 01:54:02.620]   I mean, right now you'll hear a lot of just jammering,
[01:54:02.620 --> 01:54:04.820]   people going blah, blah, blah about free speech,
[01:54:04.820 --> 01:54:06.980]   but they just wanna listen to themselves, right?
[01:54:06.980 --> 01:54:09.620]   It's like, let's face it, the old days
[01:54:09.620 --> 01:54:11.620]   before people were supposedly woke,
[01:54:11.620 --> 01:54:14.780]   they were trying to ban two live crew or, you know,
[01:54:14.780 --> 01:54:17.540]   just think about, Lenny Bruce got canceled for cursing.
[01:54:17.540 --> 01:54:19.300]   Jesus Christ, you know?
[01:54:19.300 --> 01:54:21.780]   It's like, this is nothing new.
[01:54:21.780 --> 01:54:25.020]   People don't like to hear things that disagree with them.
[01:54:25.020 --> 01:54:30.020]   But if you're in a, I mean, you can see two situations
[01:54:30.020 --> 01:54:32.700]   in groups with memory.
[01:54:32.700 --> 01:54:36.580]   One situation is you have people who are very dominant
[01:54:36.580 --> 01:54:38.540]   who just take over the conversation.
[01:54:38.540 --> 01:54:40.940]   And they, basically what happens is the group
[01:54:40.940 --> 01:54:42.860]   remembers less from the experience
[01:54:42.860 --> 01:54:44.420]   and they remember more of what
[01:54:44.420 --> 01:54:46.720]   the dominant narrator says, right?
[01:54:46.720 --> 01:54:48.820]   Now, if you have a diverse group of people,
[01:54:48.820 --> 01:54:51.220]   and I don't mean diverse in necessarily
[01:54:51.220 --> 01:54:53.140]   the human resources sense of the word.
[01:54:53.140 --> 01:54:55.540]   I mean, diverse in any way you wanna take it, right?
[01:54:55.540 --> 01:54:57.700]   But diverse in every way, hopefully.
[01:54:57.700 --> 01:54:59.700]   And you give everyone a chance to speak
[01:54:59.700 --> 01:55:02.060]   and everyone's being appreciated
[01:55:02.060 --> 01:55:03.820]   for their unique contribution.
[01:55:03.820 --> 01:55:05.380]   You get more accurate memories
[01:55:05.380 --> 01:55:08.460]   and you get more information from it, right?
[01:55:08.460 --> 01:55:10.940]   Even two people who come from very similar backgrounds,
[01:55:10.940 --> 01:55:13.380]   if you can appreciate the unique contributions
[01:55:13.380 --> 01:55:16.020]   that each one has, you can do a better job
[01:55:16.020 --> 01:55:18.460]   of generating information from memory.
[01:55:18.460 --> 01:55:20.580]   And that's a way to inoculate ourselves,
[01:55:20.580 --> 01:55:23.240]   I believe, from misinformation in the modern world.
[01:55:23.240 --> 01:55:25.500]   But like everything else,
[01:55:25.500 --> 01:55:28.300]   it requires a certain tolerance for discomfort.
[01:55:28.300 --> 01:55:31.260]   And I think when we don't have much time
[01:55:31.260 --> 01:55:33.300]   and I think when we're stressed out
[01:55:33.300 --> 01:55:36.220]   and when we are just tired,
[01:55:36.220 --> 01:55:38.980]   it's very hard to tolerate discomfort.
[01:55:38.980 --> 01:55:42.000]   - And I mean, social media has a lot of opportunity
[01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.660]   for this because it enables
[01:55:44.660 --> 01:55:46.900]   this distributed one-on-one interaction
[01:55:46.900 --> 01:55:49.500]   that you're talking about where everybody has a voice,
[01:55:49.500 --> 01:55:52.420]   but still our natural inclination,
[01:55:52.420 --> 01:55:53.820]   you see this on social media,
[01:55:53.820 --> 01:55:56.100]   is there's a natural clustering of people and opinions
[01:55:56.100 --> 01:55:59.900]   and you just kind of form these kind of bubbles.
[01:55:59.900 --> 01:56:02.380]   I think that's, to me personally,
[01:56:02.380 --> 01:56:04.460]   I think that's a technology problem that could be solved.
[01:56:04.460 --> 01:56:07.940]   If there's a little bit of interaction,
[01:56:07.940 --> 01:56:09.940]   kind, respectful, compassionate interaction
[01:56:09.940 --> 01:56:13.020]   with people that have a very different memory,
[01:56:13.020 --> 01:56:16.660]   that respectful interaction will start
[01:56:16.660 --> 01:56:20.020]   to intermix the memories and ways of thinking
[01:56:20.020 --> 01:56:23.540]   to where you're slowly moving towards truth.
[01:56:23.540 --> 01:56:24.980]   But that's a technology problem
[01:56:24.980 --> 01:56:28.620]   because naturally, left to our own devices,
[01:56:28.620 --> 01:56:30.980]   we want to cluster up in a tribe.
[01:56:30.980 --> 01:56:33.220]   - Yeah, and that's the human problem.
[01:56:33.220 --> 01:56:37.260]   I think a lot of the problems that come up with technology
[01:56:37.260 --> 01:56:38.860]   aren't the technology itself
[01:56:38.860 --> 01:56:42.820]   as much as the fact that people adapt to the technology
[01:56:42.820 --> 01:56:44.980]   in maladaptive ways.
[01:56:44.980 --> 01:56:49.420]   I mean, one of my fears about AI is not what AI will do,
[01:56:49.420 --> 01:56:50.540]   but what people will do.
[01:56:50.540 --> 01:56:52.340]   I mean, take text messaging, right?
[01:56:52.340 --> 01:56:55.460]   It's like pain in the ass to text people, at least for me.
[01:56:55.460 --> 01:56:57.500]   And so what happens is the communication
[01:56:57.500 --> 01:57:00.700]   becomes very spartan and devoid of meaning, right?
[01:57:00.700 --> 01:57:02.580]   It's just very telegraphic.
[01:57:02.580 --> 01:57:05.020]   And that's people adapting to the medium, right?
[01:57:05.020 --> 01:57:05.860]   I mean, look at you.
[01:57:05.860 --> 01:57:07.700]   You've got this keyboard, right,
[01:57:07.700 --> 01:57:10.100]   that's got these dome-shaped things,
[01:57:10.100 --> 01:57:12.820]   and you've adapted to that to communicate, right?
[01:57:12.820 --> 01:57:14.900]   That's not the technology adapting to you.
[01:57:14.900 --> 01:57:17.260]   It's you adapting to the technology.
[01:57:17.260 --> 01:57:18.940]   And I think one of the things I learned
[01:57:18.940 --> 01:57:22.620]   when Google started to introduce autocomplete in emails,
[01:57:22.620 --> 01:57:25.300]   I started to use it, and about a third of the time,
[01:57:25.300 --> 01:57:27.940]   I was like, "This isn't what I want to say."
[01:57:27.940 --> 01:57:29.060]   A third of the time, I'd be like,
[01:57:29.060 --> 01:57:31.020]   "This is exactly what I wanted to say."
[01:57:31.020 --> 01:57:32.220]   And a third of the time, I was saying,
[01:57:32.220 --> 01:57:33.140]   "Well, this is good enough.
[01:57:33.140 --> 01:57:35.500]   "I'll just go with it," right?
[01:57:35.500 --> 01:57:38.380]   And so what happens is it's not that the technology
[01:57:38.380 --> 01:57:41.060]   necessarily is doing anything so bad,
[01:57:41.060 --> 01:57:45.020]   as much as it's just going to constrain my language
[01:57:45.020 --> 01:57:48.860]   because I'm just doing what's being suggested to me.
[01:57:48.860 --> 01:57:52.620]   And so this is why I say, kind of like my mantra
[01:57:52.620 --> 01:57:56.660]   for some of what I've learned about everything in memory
[01:57:56.660 --> 01:57:59.740]   is to diversify your training data, basically,
[01:57:59.740 --> 01:58:01.780]   because otherwise you're going to...
[01:58:01.780 --> 01:58:05.900]   So humans have this capability to be so much more creative
[01:58:05.900 --> 01:58:08.460]   than anything generative AI will put together,
[01:58:08.460 --> 01:58:09.500]   at least right now.
[01:58:09.500 --> 01:58:11.060]   Who knows where this goes?
[01:58:11.060 --> 01:58:14.180]   But it can also go the opposite direction
[01:58:14.180 --> 01:58:17.180]   where people could become much, much less creative
[01:58:17.180 --> 01:58:22.180]   if they just become more and more resistant to discomfort
[01:58:22.180 --> 01:58:26.300]   and resistant to exposing themselves to novelty,
[01:58:26.300 --> 01:58:29.060]   to cognitive dissonance, and so forth.
[01:58:29.060 --> 01:58:30.140]   - I think there is a dance
[01:58:30.140 --> 01:58:32.820]   between natural human adaptation of technology
[01:58:32.820 --> 01:58:35.740]   and the people that design the engineering
[01:58:35.740 --> 01:58:37.060]   of that technology.
[01:58:37.060 --> 01:58:38.580]   So I think there's a lot of opportunity
[01:58:38.580 --> 01:58:40.580]   to create, like this keyboard,
[01:58:40.580 --> 01:58:45.300]   things that on that are positive for human behavior.
[01:58:45.300 --> 01:58:47.300]   So we adapt and all this kind of stuff,
[01:58:47.300 --> 01:58:51.100]   but when you look at the long arc of history
[01:58:51.100 --> 01:58:52.700]   across years and decades,
[01:58:52.700 --> 01:58:55.860]   has humanity been flourishing?
[01:58:55.860 --> 01:58:58.660]   Are humans creating more awesome stuff?
[01:58:58.660 --> 01:59:00.580]   Are humans happier? All that kind of stuff.
[01:59:00.580 --> 01:59:04.660]   And so there, I think technology on that has been,
[01:59:04.660 --> 01:59:07.380]   and I think, maybe hope,
[01:59:07.380 --> 01:59:10.860]   will always be on that a positive thing.
[01:59:10.860 --> 01:59:12.300]   - Do you think people are happier now
[01:59:12.300 --> 01:59:14.700]   than they were 50 years ago or 100 years ago?
[01:59:14.700 --> 01:59:16.140]   - Yes, yes.
[01:59:16.140 --> 01:59:17.420]   - I don't know about that.
[01:59:17.420 --> 01:59:22.420]   - I think humans in general like to reminisce about the past,
[01:59:22.420 --> 01:59:24.860]   like the times are better. - That's true.
[01:59:24.860 --> 01:59:27.580]   - And complain about the weather today
[01:59:27.580 --> 01:59:29.060]   or complain about whatever today,
[01:59:29.060 --> 01:59:32.980]   'cause we, there's this kind of complainy engine
[01:59:32.980 --> 01:59:35.500]   that just, there's so much pleasure in saying,
[01:59:35.500 --> 01:59:37.860]   you know, life sucks for some reason.
[01:59:37.860 --> 01:59:39.620]   (Lyle laughs)
[01:59:39.620 --> 01:59:41.180]   - That's why I love punk rock.
[01:59:41.180 --> 01:59:43.860]   - Exactly, I mean, there's something in humans
[01:59:43.860 --> 01:59:48.220]   that loves complaining, even about trivial things,
[01:59:48.220 --> 01:59:52.100]   but complaining about change, complaining about everything.
[01:59:52.100 --> 01:59:55.260]   But ultimately, I think on net,
[01:59:55.260 --> 01:59:59.500]   on every measure, things are getting better.
[01:59:59.500 --> 02:00:00.940]   Life is getting better.
[02:00:00.940 --> 02:00:02.100]   - Oh, life is getting better,
[02:00:02.100 --> 02:00:03.220]   but I don't know necessarily
[02:00:03.220 --> 02:00:06.100]   that attracts people's happiness, right?
[02:00:06.100 --> 02:00:08.220]   I mean, I would argue that maybe, and who knows?
[02:00:08.220 --> 02:00:10.340]   I don't know this, but I wouldn't be surprised
[02:00:10.340 --> 02:00:14.220]   if people in hunter-gatherer societies are happier.
[02:00:14.220 --> 02:00:16.220]   I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if they're happier
[02:00:16.220 --> 02:00:19.980]   than people who have access to modern medicine
[02:00:19.980 --> 02:00:23.020]   and email and cell phones.
[02:00:23.020 --> 02:00:24.340]   - Well, I don't think there's a question
[02:00:24.340 --> 02:00:26.900]   whether you take hunter-gatherer folks
[02:00:26.900 --> 02:00:28.540]   and put them into modern day
[02:00:28.540 --> 02:00:29.860]   and give them enough time to adapt,
[02:00:29.860 --> 02:00:31.060]   they would be much happier.
[02:00:31.060 --> 02:00:35.260]   The question is in terms of every single problem they've had
[02:00:35.260 --> 02:00:36.660]   is now solved.
[02:00:36.660 --> 02:00:39.340]   There's now food, there is guarantee of survival,
[02:00:39.340 --> 02:00:40.540]   shelter, and all this kind of stuff.
[02:00:40.540 --> 02:00:42.300]   So what you're asking is a deeper
[02:00:42.300 --> 02:00:44.180]   sort of biological question.
[02:00:44.180 --> 02:00:47.940]   Do we want to be, oh, Werner Herzog in the movie
[02:00:47.940 --> 02:00:49.940]   "Happy People, Life in the Taiga,"
[02:00:49.940 --> 02:00:52.660]   do we want to be busy 100% of our time
[02:00:52.660 --> 02:00:57.380]   hunting, gathering, surviving, worried about the next day?
[02:00:57.380 --> 02:01:00.540]   Maybe that constant struggle
[02:01:00.540 --> 02:01:02.780]   ultimately creates a more fulfilling life.
[02:01:02.780 --> 02:01:06.720]   I don't know, but I do know this modern society
[02:01:06.720 --> 02:01:11.020]   allows us to, when we're sick,
[02:01:11.020 --> 02:01:13.780]   to find medicine, to find cures.
[02:01:13.780 --> 02:01:15.860]   When we're hungry, to get food,
[02:01:15.860 --> 02:01:19.740]   much more than we did even 100 years ago.
[02:01:19.740 --> 02:01:22.500]   And there's many more activities.
[02:01:22.500 --> 02:01:24.060]   I think you could perform a creative,
[02:01:24.060 --> 02:01:27.620]   all this kind of stuff that enables the flourishing
[02:01:27.620 --> 02:01:29.860]   of humans at the individual level.
[02:01:29.860 --> 02:01:31.540]   Whether that leads to happiness,
[02:01:31.540 --> 02:01:34.180]   I mean, that's a very deep philosophical question.
[02:01:34.180 --> 02:01:39.180]   Maybe struggle, deep struggle is necessary for happiness.
[02:01:39.180 --> 02:01:43.300]   - Or maybe cultural connection.
[02:01:43.300 --> 02:01:47.300]   Maybe it's about functioning in social groups
[02:01:47.300 --> 02:01:49.900]   that are meaningful and having time.
[02:01:49.900 --> 02:01:51.560]   But I do think there's an interesting
[02:01:51.560 --> 02:01:54.700]   memory-related thing, which is that if you look
[02:01:54.700 --> 02:01:57.820]   at things like reinforcement learning, for instance,
[02:01:57.820 --> 02:02:01.460]   you're not learning necessarily every time
[02:02:01.460 --> 02:02:04.100]   you get a reward, if it's the same reward,
[02:02:04.100 --> 02:02:06.320]   you're not learning that much.
[02:02:06.320 --> 02:02:08.820]   You mainly learn if it deviates from your expectation
[02:02:08.820 --> 02:02:10.100]   of what you're supposed to get, right?
[02:02:10.100 --> 02:02:13.280]   So it's like, you get a paycheck every month
[02:02:13.280 --> 02:02:15.140]   from MIT or whatever, right?
[02:02:15.140 --> 02:02:18.700]   And it's like, you probably don't even get excited
[02:02:18.700 --> 02:02:20.280]   about it when you get the paycheck.
[02:02:20.280 --> 02:02:22.500]   But if they cut your salary, you're gonna be pissed.
[02:02:22.500 --> 02:02:23.940]   And if they increase your salary,
[02:02:23.940 --> 02:02:26.140]   oh, good, I got a bonus, you know?
[02:02:26.140 --> 02:02:30.220]   And that adaptation and that ability
[02:02:30.220 --> 02:02:33.820]   that basically you learn to expect these things,
[02:02:33.820 --> 02:02:38.120]   I think, is a major source of, I guess,
[02:02:38.120 --> 02:02:40.620]   it's a major way in which we're kind of more,
[02:02:40.620 --> 02:02:45.060]   in my opinion, wired to strive and not be happy,
[02:02:45.060 --> 02:02:46.460]   to be in a state of wanting.
[02:02:46.460 --> 02:02:48.920]   And so people talk about dopamine, for instance,
[02:02:48.920 --> 02:02:50.740]   being this pleasure chemical.
[02:02:50.740 --> 02:02:53.420]   And it's like, there's a lot of compelling research
[02:02:53.420 --> 02:02:57.180]   to suggest it's not about pleasure at all.
[02:02:57.180 --> 02:03:01.100]   It's about the discomfort that energizes you
[02:03:01.100 --> 02:03:04.620]   to get things, to seek a reward, right?
[02:03:04.620 --> 02:03:06.160]   And so you could give an animal
[02:03:06.160 --> 02:03:08.700]   that's been deprived of dopamine a reward,
[02:03:08.700 --> 02:03:11.600]   and oh, yeah, I enjoy it, it's pretty good.
[02:03:11.600 --> 02:03:14.940]   But they're not gonna do anything to get it, you know?
[02:03:14.940 --> 02:03:17.900]   And just one of the weird things in our research
[02:03:17.900 --> 02:03:22.340]   is I got into curiosity from a postdoc in my lab,
[02:03:22.340 --> 02:03:25.780]   Matthias Gruber, and one of the things that we found
[02:03:25.780 --> 02:03:27.860]   is when we gave people a question,
[02:03:27.860 --> 02:03:31.380]   like a trivia question that they wanted the answer to,
[02:03:31.380 --> 02:03:34.380]   that question, the more curious people were
[02:03:34.380 --> 02:03:36.500]   about the answer, the more activity
[02:03:36.500 --> 02:03:38.460]   in these dopamine-related circuits
[02:03:38.460 --> 02:03:39.740]   in the brain we would see.
[02:03:39.740 --> 02:03:43.100]   And again, that was not driven by the answer per se,
[02:03:43.100 --> 02:03:44.740]   but by the question.
[02:03:44.740 --> 02:03:47.460]   So it was not about getting the information,
[02:03:47.460 --> 02:03:50.280]   it was about the drive to seek the information.
[02:03:50.280 --> 02:03:53.660]   But it depends on how you take that.
[02:03:53.660 --> 02:03:55.500]   If you get this uncomfortable gap
[02:03:55.500 --> 02:03:58.740]   between what you know and what you want to know,
[02:03:58.740 --> 02:04:01.660]   you could either use that to motivate you and energize you,
[02:04:01.660 --> 02:04:03.420]   or you could use it to say,
[02:04:03.420 --> 02:04:04.640]   I don't wanna hear about this,
[02:04:04.640 --> 02:04:06.260]   this disagrees with my beliefs,
[02:04:06.260 --> 02:04:08.660]   I'm gonna go back to my echo chamber, you know?
[02:04:08.660 --> 02:04:10.820]   - Yeah.
[02:04:10.820 --> 02:04:14.900]   I like what you said, that maybe we're designed
[02:04:14.900 --> 02:04:17.980]   to be in a kind of constant state of wanting,
[02:04:17.980 --> 02:04:21.340]   which, by the way, is a pretty good either band name
[02:04:21.340 --> 02:04:25.420]   or rock song name, state of wanting.
[02:04:25.420 --> 02:04:28.220]   - That's like a hardcore band name, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:04:28.220 --> 02:04:29.060]   - Yeah, it's pretty good.
[02:04:29.060 --> 02:04:31.180]   - But I also like the hedonic treadmill.
[02:04:31.180 --> 02:04:32.580]   - Hedonic treadmill's pretty good.
[02:04:32.580 --> 02:04:33.700]   - Yeah, yeah, we could use that
[02:04:33.700 --> 02:04:37.060]   for like our techno project, I think.
[02:04:37.060 --> 02:04:38.300]   - You mean the one we're starting?
[02:04:38.300 --> 02:04:39.900]   - Yeah, exactly. - Okay, great.
[02:04:39.900 --> 02:04:43.500]   We're going on tour soon.
[02:04:43.620 --> 02:04:45.580]   (laughing)
[02:04:45.580 --> 02:04:47.540]   This is our announcement.
[02:04:47.540 --> 02:04:49.980]   - We could build a false memory of a show, in fact,
[02:04:49.980 --> 02:04:51.740]   if you want, let's just put it all together.
[02:04:51.740 --> 02:04:54.500]   So we don't even have to do all the work to play the show,
[02:04:54.500 --> 02:04:56.860]   we can just create a memory of it and it might as well
[02:04:56.860 --> 02:05:00.300]   happen, 'cause the remembering self is in charge anyway.
[02:05:00.300 --> 02:05:02.700]   - So let me ask you about, we talked about false memories,
[02:05:02.700 --> 02:05:05.660]   but in the legal system, false confessions.
[02:05:05.660 --> 02:05:09.460]   I remember reading 1984 where,
[02:05:09.460 --> 02:05:12.280]   sorry for the dark turn of our conversation,
[02:05:12.280 --> 02:05:17.280]   but through torture, you can make people say anything
[02:05:17.280 --> 02:05:20.460]   and essentially remember anything.
[02:05:20.460 --> 02:05:22.500]   I wonder to what degree there's truth to that,
[02:05:22.500 --> 02:05:26.020]   if you look at the torture that happened in the Soviet Union
[02:05:26.020 --> 02:05:28.140]   for confessions, all that kind of stuff.
[02:05:28.140 --> 02:05:31.460]   How much can you really get people to really,
[02:05:31.460 --> 02:05:36.240]   yeah, to force false memories, I guess?
[02:05:36.240 --> 02:05:40.340]   - Yeah, I mean, I think there's a lot of history of this
[02:05:40.340 --> 02:05:43.960]   actually in the criminal justice system.
[02:05:43.960 --> 02:05:46.720]   You might've heard the term, the third degree.
[02:05:46.720 --> 02:05:49.160]   If you actually look it up, historically,
[02:05:49.160 --> 02:05:54.120]   it was a very intense set of beatings and starvation,
[02:05:54.120 --> 02:05:58.360]   physical demands that they would place at people
[02:05:58.360 --> 02:05:59.480]   to get them to talk.
[02:05:59.480 --> 02:06:03.260]   And there was certainly a lot of work that's been done
[02:06:03.260 --> 02:06:07.320]   by the CIA in terms of enhanced interrogation techniques.
[02:06:07.320 --> 02:06:11.340]   And from what I understand, the research actually shows
[02:06:11.340 --> 02:06:15.420]   that they just produce what people want to hear,
[02:06:15.420 --> 02:06:19.260]   not necessarily the information that is being looked for.
[02:06:19.260 --> 02:06:22.960]   And the reason is that, I mean, there's different reasons.
[02:06:22.960 --> 02:06:25.060]   I mean, one is people just get tired of being tortured
[02:06:25.060 --> 02:06:26.420]   and just say whatever.
[02:06:26.420 --> 02:06:29.700]   But another part of it is that you create
[02:06:29.700 --> 02:06:32.180]   a very interesting set of conditions
[02:06:32.180 --> 02:06:36.020]   where there's an authority figure telling you something,
[02:06:36.020 --> 02:06:37.800]   that you did this, we know you did this,
[02:06:37.800 --> 02:06:39.640]   we have witnesses saying you did this.
[02:06:39.640 --> 02:06:42.100]   So now you start to question yourself.
[02:06:42.100 --> 02:06:44.080]   Then they put you under stress.
[02:06:44.080 --> 02:06:46.000]   Maybe they're not feeding you.
[02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:48.360]   Maybe they're kind of like making you be cold
[02:06:48.360 --> 02:06:53.200]   or exposing you to music that you can't stand or something,
[02:06:53.200 --> 02:06:54.680]   whatever it is, right?
[02:06:54.680 --> 02:06:58.440]   It's like they're creating this physical stress.
[02:06:58.440 --> 02:07:01.520]   And so stress starts to act on,
[02:07:01.520 --> 02:07:03.880]   starts to down-regulate the prefrontal cortex.
[02:07:03.880 --> 02:07:05.740]   They're not necessarily as good at monitoring
[02:07:05.740 --> 02:07:07.700]   the accuracy of stuff.
[02:07:07.700 --> 02:07:09.420]   Then they start to get nice to you and they say,
[02:07:09.420 --> 02:07:11.940]   imagine, okay, I know you don't remember this,
[02:07:11.940 --> 02:07:14.940]   but maybe we can walk you through how it could have happened
[02:07:14.940 --> 02:07:17.120]   and they feed you the information.
[02:07:17.120 --> 02:07:20.340]   And so you're in this weakened mental state
[02:07:20.340 --> 02:07:22.660]   and you're being encouraged to imagine things
[02:07:22.660 --> 02:07:25.640]   by people who give you a plausible scenario.
[02:07:25.640 --> 02:07:29.520]   And at some point, certain people can be very coaxed
[02:07:29.520 --> 02:07:33.020]   into creating a memory for something that never happened.
[02:07:33.020 --> 02:07:35.740]   And there's actually some pretty convincing cases out there
[02:07:35.740 --> 02:07:38.780]   where you don't know exactly the truth.
[02:07:38.780 --> 02:07:40.340]   There's a sheriff, for instance,
[02:07:40.340 --> 02:07:44.000]   who came to believe that he had a false memory.
[02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.940]   I mean, that he had a memory of doing sexual abuse
[02:07:46.940 --> 02:07:49.900]   based on, you know, essentially, I think it was,
[02:07:49.900 --> 02:07:52.780]   you know, I'm not gonna tell the story
[02:07:52.780 --> 02:07:54.460]   because I don't remember it well enough
[02:07:54.460 --> 02:07:57.020]   to necessarily accurately give it to you,
[02:07:57.020 --> 02:07:58.860]   but people could look this stuff up.
[02:07:58.860 --> 02:08:00.960]   There are definitely stories out there like this,
[02:08:00.960 --> 02:08:03.820]   where people confess to crimes that they just didn't do
[02:08:03.820 --> 02:08:06.480]   and objective evidence came out later on.
[02:08:06.480 --> 02:08:10.020]   But there's a basic recipe for it,
[02:08:10.020 --> 02:08:12.660]   which is you feed people the information
[02:08:12.660 --> 02:08:16.620]   that you want them to remember, you stress them out,
[02:08:16.620 --> 02:08:18.300]   you have an authority figure
[02:08:18.300 --> 02:08:21.500]   kind of like pushing this information on them,
[02:08:21.500 --> 02:08:24.160]   or you motivate them to produce the information
[02:08:24.160 --> 02:08:27.860]   you're looking for, and that pretty much over time
[02:08:27.860 --> 02:08:29.640]   gives you what you want.
[02:08:29.640 --> 02:08:34.640]   It's really tragic that centralized power
[02:08:34.640 --> 02:08:40.420]   can use these kinds of tools to destroy lives.
[02:08:40.420 --> 02:08:41.260]   Sad.
[02:08:41.260 --> 02:08:47.220]   Since there's a theme about music
[02:08:47.220 --> 02:08:49.180]   throughout this conversation,
[02:08:49.180 --> 02:08:53.500]   one of the best topics for songs is heartbreak,
[02:08:53.500 --> 02:08:55.240]   love in general, but heartbreak.
[02:08:56.400 --> 02:08:59.680]   Why and how do we remember and forget heartbreak?
[02:08:59.680 --> 02:09:00.720]   Asking for a friend.
[02:09:00.720 --> 02:09:03.340]   - Oh, God, that's so hard to,
[02:09:03.340 --> 02:09:05.000]   asking for a friend, I love that.
[02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:08.840]   Oh, it's such a hard one.
[02:09:08.840 --> 02:09:13.840]   Well, so, I mean, part of this is we tend to go back
[02:09:13.840 --> 02:09:17.040]   to particular times that are the more
[02:09:17.040 --> 02:09:19.080]   emotionally intense periods,
[02:09:19.080 --> 02:09:24.840]   and so that's a part of it, and again,
[02:09:24.840 --> 02:09:27.500]   memory is designed to kind of capture these things
[02:09:27.500 --> 02:09:29.340]   that are biologically significant,
[02:09:29.340 --> 02:09:33.140]   and attachment is a big part of biological significance
[02:09:33.140 --> 02:09:33.980]   for humans, right?
[02:09:33.980 --> 02:09:36.940]   Human relationships are super important,
[02:09:36.940 --> 02:09:40.740]   and sometimes that heartbreak comes with massive changes
[02:09:40.740 --> 02:09:42.060]   in your beliefs about somebody,
[02:09:42.060 --> 02:09:45.220]   say if they cheated on you or something like that,
[02:09:45.220 --> 02:09:47.780]   or regrets, and you kind of ruminate about things
[02:09:47.780 --> 02:09:48.940]   that you've done wrong.
[02:09:48.940 --> 02:09:53.760]   There's really so many reasons, though,
[02:09:53.760 --> 02:09:55.700]   but I mean, I've had this.
[02:09:55.700 --> 02:10:01.460]   My first pet I had was,
[02:10:01.460 --> 02:10:03.220]   we got her for a wedding present as a cat,
[02:10:03.220 --> 02:10:07.180]   and got it after, but it died of FIP
[02:10:07.180 --> 02:10:08.860]   when it was four years old,
[02:10:08.860 --> 02:10:13.580]   and I just would see her everywhere around the house.
[02:10:13.580 --> 02:10:16.020]   We got another cat, then we got a dog.
[02:10:16.020 --> 02:10:17.860]   Dog eventually died of cancer,
[02:10:17.860 --> 02:10:20.220]   and the cat just died recently,
[02:10:20.220 --> 02:10:24.120]   and so we got a new dog because I kept seeing
[02:10:24.120 --> 02:10:27.640]   the dog around, and I was just so heartbroken about this,
[02:10:27.640 --> 02:10:30.760]   but I still remember the pets that died.
[02:10:30.760 --> 02:10:32.080]   It just comes back to you.
[02:10:32.080 --> 02:10:33.240]   I mean, it's part of this.
[02:10:33.240 --> 02:10:36.120]   I think there's also something about attachment
[02:10:36.120 --> 02:10:39.240]   that's just so crucial that drives, again,
[02:10:39.240 --> 02:10:41.640]   these things that we want to remember,
[02:10:41.640 --> 02:10:44.520]   and that gives us that longing sometimes.
[02:10:44.520 --> 02:10:47.600]   Sometimes it's also not just about the heartbreak,
[02:10:47.600 --> 02:10:50.400]   but about the positive aspects of it,
[02:10:50.400 --> 02:10:53.240]   'cause the loss comes from not only the fact
[02:10:53.240 --> 02:10:55.640]   that the relationship is over,
[02:10:55.640 --> 02:10:58.760]   but you had all of these good things before
[02:10:58.760 --> 02:11:01.840]   that you can now see in a new light,
[02:11:01.840 --> 02:11:05.520]   and so part of, one of the things that I found
[02:11:05.520 --> 02:11:07.500]   from my clinical background that really, I think,
[02:11:07.500 --> 02:11:09.960]   gave me a different perspective on memory
[02:11:09.960 --> 02:11:12.300]   is so much of the therapy process
[02:11:12.300 --> 02:11:14.880]   was guided towards reframing
[02:11:14.880 --> 02:11:19.240]   and getting people to look at the past in a different way,
[02:11:19.240 --> 02:11:21.600]   not by imposing, changing people's memories,
[02:11:21.600 --> 02:11:24.200]   or not by imposing an interpretation,
[02:11:24.200 --> 02:11:26.600]   but just offering a different perspective,
[02:11:26.600 --> 02:11:28.400]   and maybe one that's kind of more optimized
[02:11:28.400 --> 02:11:33.080]   towards learning, and an appreciation, maybe,
[02:11:33.080 --> 02:11:35.320]   or gratitude, whatever it is, right,
[02:11:35.320 --> 02:11:37.400]   that gives you a way of taking,
[02:11:37.400 --> 02:11:39.080]   I think you said it in the beginning, right,
[02:11:39.080 --> 02:11:42.360]   where you can have this kind of like dark experiences,
[02:11:42.360 --> 02:11:45.720]   and you can use it as training data
[02:11:45.720 --> 02:11:49.720]   to grow in new ways, but it's hard.
[02:11:49.720 --> 02:11:53.520]   - I often go back to this moment,
[02:11:53.520 --> 02:11:56.560]   this show "Louie" with Louis C.K.,
[02:11:56.560 --> 02:11:59.160]   where he's all heartbroken about a breakup
[02:11:59.160 --> 02:12:01.120]   with a woman he loves,
[02:12:01.120 --> 02:12:05.940]   and an older gentleman tells him
[02:12:05.940 --> 02:12:09.660]   that that's actually the best part, that heartbreak,
[02:12:09.660 --> 02:12:12.120]   because you get to intensely experience
[02:12:12.120 --> 02:12:14.280]   how valuable this love was.
[02:12:14.280 --> 02:12:17.320]   He says the worst part is forgetting it,
[02:12:17.320 --> 02:12:19.680]   is actually when you get over the heartbreak,
[02:12:19.680 --> 02:12:21.120]   that's the worst part.
[02:12:21.120 --> 02:12:23.480]   So I sometimes think about that,
[02:12:23.480 --> 02:12:28.360]   because having the love and losing it,
[02:12:28.360 --> 02:12:32.800]   like the losing it is when you sometimes
[02:12:32.800 --> 02:12:37.160]   feel it the deepest, which is an interesting way
[02:12:37.160 --> 02:12:40.640]   to celebrate the past and relive it.
[02:12:40.640 --> 02:12:42.620]   It sucks that you don't have a thing,
[02:12:42.620 --> 02:12:43.920]   but when you don't have a thing,
[02:12:43.920 --> 02:12:48.880]   it's a good moment to viscerally experience
[02:12:48.880 --> 02:12:53.280]   the memories of something that you now appreciate even more.
[02:12:53.280 --> 02:12:55.840]   - So you don't believe that an owner of a lonely heart
[02:12:55.840 --> 02:12:58.200]   is much better than an owner of a broken heart?
[02:12:58.200 --> 02:13:01.000]   You think an owner of a broken heart
[02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:02.740]   is better than the owner of a lonely heart?
[02:13:02.740 --> 02:13:05.200]   - Yes, for sure, I think so, I think so.
[02:13:05.200 --> 02:13:07.640]   But I'm gonna have to, day by day,
[02:13:07.640 --> 02:13:09.080]   I don't know, I'm gonna have to listen
[02:13:09.080 --> 02:13:12.520]   to some more Bruce Springsteen to figure that one out.
[02:13:12.520 --> 02:13:14.000]   - Well, you know, it's funny because it's like,
[02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:17.040]   after I turned 50, I think of death all the time.
[02:13:17.040 --> 02:13:22.040]   I just think that I'm in, I probably have fewer years
[02:13:22.040 --> 02:13:24.560]   ahead of me than I have behind me, right?
[02:13:24.560 --> 02:13:27.240]   So I think about one thing, which is,
[02:13:27.240 --> 02:13:29.580]   what are the memories that I wanna carry with me
[02:13:29.580 --> 02:13:32.200]   for the next period of time?
[02:13:32.200 --> 02:13:35.360]   And also about just the fact that everything around me
[02:13:35.960 --> 02:13:40.800]   I know more people who are dying for various reasons.
[02:13:40.800 --> 02:13:45.320]   And so, I'm not lost, I'm not that old, right?
[02:13:45.320 --> 02:13:49.400]   But it's something that I think about a lot,
[02:13:49.400 --> 02:13:53.800]   and I'm reminded of how I talked to somebody
[02:13:53.800 --> 02:13:56.680]   who's a Buddhist, and I was like,
[02:13:56.680 --> 02:13:59.520]   the whole idea of Buddhism is renouncing attachments.
[02:13:59.520 --> 02:14:02.900]   Some way, the idea of Buddhism is staying out
[02:14:02.900 --> 02:14:05.860]   of the world of memory and staying in the moment, right?
[02:14:05.860 --> 02:14:07.860]   And they talked about, you know, it's like,
[02:14:07.860 --> 02:14:10.860]   how do you renounce attachments
[02:14:10.860 --> 02:14:12.680]   to the people that you love, right?
[02:14:12.680 --> 02:14:14.580]   And they're just saying, well, I appreciate
[02:14:14.580 --> 02:14:16.060]   that I have this moment with them,
[02:14:16.060 --> 02:14:18.500]   and knowing that they will die makes me appreciate
[02:14:18.500 --> 02:14:20.700]   this moment that much more.
[02:14:20.700 --> 02:14:22.380]   I mean, you said something similar, right,
[02:14:22.380 --> 02:14:25.260]   in your daily routine that you think about things this way,
[02:14:25.260 --> 02:14:26.100]   right?
[02:14:26.100 --> 02:14:29.480]   - Yeah, I meditate on mortality every day.
[02:14:30.860 --> 02:14:33.180]   But, I don't know, at the same time,
[02:14:33.180 --> 02:14:34.660]   that really makes you appreciate the moment
[02:14:34.660 --> 02:14:38.740]   and live in the moment, and I also appreciate
[02:14:38.740 --> 02:14:41.740]   the full, deep rollercoaster of suffering
[02:14:41.740 --> 02:14:45.320]   involved in life, the little and the big, too.
[02:14:45.320 --> 02:14:46.660]   So, I don't know.
[02:14:46.660 --> 02:14:50.620]   The Buddhist kind of removing yourself from the world,
[02:14:50.620 --> 02:14:52.680]   or the Stoic, removing yourself from the world,
[02:14:52.680 --> 02:14:56.020]   the world of emotion, I'm torn about that one.
[02:14:56.020 --> 02:14:56.940]   I'm not sure.
[02:14:56.940 --> 02:14:59.740]   - Well, you know, this is where Hinduism and Buddhism,
[02:14:59.740 --> 02:15:02.220]   or at least some strains of Hinduism and Buddhism differ.
[02:15:02.220 --> 02:15:06.420]   In Hinduism, like if you read the Bhagavad Gita,
[02:15:06.420 --> 02:15:11.140]   the philosophy is not one of renouncing the world,
[02:15:11.140 --> 02:15:14.520]   because the idea is that not doing something
[02:15:14.520 --> 02:15:17.260]   is no different than doing something, right?
[02:15:17.260 --> 02:15:20.580]   So, what they argue, and again, you could interpret
[02:15:20.580 --> 02:15:22.580]   in different ways, positive and negative,
[02:15:22.580 --> 02:15:25.020]   but the argument is is that you don't want
[02:15:25.020 --> 02:15:28.020]   to renounce action, but you want to renounce
[02:15:28.020 --> 02:15:29.980]   the fruits of the action.
[02:15:29.980 --> 02:15:32.460]   You don't do it because of the outcome,
[02:15:32.460 --> 02:15:34.760]   you do it because of the process,
[02:15:34.760 --> 02:15:37.460]   because the process is part of the balance
[02:15:37.460 --> 02:15:40.020]   of the world that you're trying to preserve, right?
[02:15:40.020 --> 02:15:41.860]   And of course, you could take that different ways,
[02:15:41.860 --> 02:15:44.380]   but I really think about that from time to time
[02:15:44.380 --> 02:15:48.220]   in terms of like, you know, letting go of this idea
[02:15:48.220 --> 02:15:52.460]   of does this book sell, or trying to, you know,
[02:15:52.460 --> 02:15:55.460]   like impress you and get you to laugh at my jokes
[02:15:55.460 --> 02:15:57.800]   or whatever, and just be more like I'm sharing
[02:15:57.800 --> 02:16:00.300]   this information with you and, you know,
[02:16:00.300 --> 02:16:01.900]   getting to know you or whatever it is.
[02:16:01.900 --> 02:16:03.780]   But it's hard, right?
[02:16:03.780 --> 02:16:07.260]   It's like, 'cause we're so driven by the reinforcer,
[02:16:07.260 --> 02:16:08.340]   the outcome.
[02:16:08.340 --> 02:16:12.380]   - You're just part of the process of telling the joke,
[02:16:12.380 --> 02:16:16.820]   and if I laugh or not, that's up to the universe to decide.
[02:16:16.820 --> 02:16:18.220]   - Yep, it's my dharma.
[02:16:18.220 --> 02:16:22.660]   - How does studying memory affect your understanding
[02:16:22.660 --> 02:16:23.980]   of the nature of time?
[02:16:23.980 --> 02:16:28.980]   So like, we've been talking about us living in the present
[02:16:28.980 --> 02:16:33.380]   and making decisions about the future,
[02:16:33.380 --> 02:16:35.900]   standing on the foundation of these memories
[02:16:35.900 --> 02:16:38.660]   and narratives about the memories that we've constructed.
[02:16:38.660 --> 02:16:43.420]   So it feels like it does weird things to time.
[02:16:43.420 --> 02:16:46.540]   - Yeah, and the reason is, is that in some sense,
[02:16:46.540 --> 02:16:49.540]   I think, especially the farther we go back,
[02:16:49.540 --> 02:16:51.420]   I mean, there's all sorts of interesting things
[02:16:51.420 --> 02:16:54.220]   that happen, so your sense of like,
[02:16:54.220 --> 02:16:58.260]   if I ask you how different does one hour ago feel
[02:16:58.260 --> 02:17:01.860]   from two hours ago, you'd probably say pretty different.
[02:17:01.860 --> 02:17:04.620]   But if I ask you, okay, go back one year ago
[02:17:04.620 --> 02:17:06.420]   versus one year and one hour ago,
[02:17:06.420 --> 02:17:07.860]   it's the same difference in time,
[02:17:07.860 --> 02:17:09.340]   it won't feel very different, right?
[02:17:09.340 --> 02:17:11.860]   So there's this kind of compression that happens
[02:17:11.860 --> 02:17:14.940]   as you look back farther in time.
[02:17:14.940 --> 02:17:17.460]   So that it's kind of like why when you're older,
[02:17:17.460 --> 02:17:20.060]   the difference between somebody who's like 50
[02:17:20.060 --> 02:17:23.420]   and 45 doesn't seem as big as the difference
[02:17:23.420 --> 02:17:25.220]   between like 10 and five or something, right?
[02:17:25.220 --> 02:17:27.660]   When you're 10 years old, everything seems like
[02:17:27.660 --> 02:17:29.220]   it's a long period of time.
[02:17:29.220 --> 02:17:32.220]   Here's the point is that, so one of the interesting things
[02:17:32.220 --> 02:17:34.460]   that I found when I was working on the book actually
[02:17:34.460 --> 02:17:38.180]   was during the pandemic, I just decided to ask people
[02:17:38.180 --> 02:17:40.340]   in my class when we were doing the remote instruction.
[02:17:40.340 --> 02:17:42.860]   So one of the things I did was I'd pull people.
[02:17:42.860 --> 02:17:46.380]   And so I just asked people, do you feel like the days
[02:17:46.380 --> 02:17:51.060]   are moving by slower or faster or about the same?
[02:17:51.060 --> 02:17:53.460]   Almost everyone in the class said that the days
[02:17:53.460 --> 02:17:54.820]   were moving by slower.
[02:17:54.820 --> 02:17:59.620]   So then I would say, okay, so do you feel like the weeks
[02:17:59.620 --> 02:18:02.900]   are passing by slower, faster or the same?
[02:18:02.900 --> 02:18:04.660]   And the majority of them said that the weeks
[02:18:04.660 --> 02:18:06.660]   were passing by faster.
[02:18:06.660 --> 02:18:08.860]   So according to the laws of physics,
[02:18:08.860 --> 02:18:11.540]   I don't think that makes any sense, right?
[02:18:11.540 --> 02:18:14.740]   But according to memory, it did because what happened
[02:18:14.740 --> 02:18:17.620]   was people were doing the same thing over and over
[02:18:17.620 --> 02:18:19.340]   in the same context.
[02:18:19.340 --> 02:18:22.140]   And without that change in context,
[02:18:22.140 --> 02:18:25.020]   their feeling was that they were
[02:18:25.020 --> 02:18:28.220]   in one long monotonous event.
[02:18:28.220 --> 02:18:30.580]   And so, but then at the end of the week,
[02:18:30.580 --> 02:18:33.700]   you look back at that week and you say, well, what happened?
[02:18:33.700 --> 02:18:35.500]   No memories of what happened.
[02:18:35.500 --> 02:18:37.660]   So it must, the week just went by
[02:18:37.660 --> 02:18:39.420]   without even my noticing it.
[02:18:39.420 --> 02:18:42.820]   But that week went by during the same amount of time
[02:18:42.820 --> 02:18:45.140]   as an eventful week where you might've been going out,
[02:18:45.140 --> 02:18:48.060]   hanging out with friends on vacation or whatever, right?
[02:18:48.060 --> 02:18:50.300]   It's just that nothing happened
[02:18:50.300 --> 02:18:52.260]   because you're doing the same thing over and over.
[02:18:52.260 --> 02:18:56.660]   So I feel like memory really shapes our sense of time,
[02:18:56.660 --> 02:18:59.540]   but it does so in part because context
[02:18:59.540 --> 02:19:01.460]   is so important for memory.
[02:19:01.460 --> 02:19:03.660]   - Well, that compression you mentioned,
[02:19:03.660 --> 02:19:05.740]   it's an interesting process.
[02:19:05.740 --> 02:19:10.020]   'Cause what I think about when I was like 12, 15,
[02:19:11.780 --> 02:19:15.340]   I just fundamentally feel like the same person.
[02:19:15.340 --> 02:19:17.020]   It's interesting what that compression does.
[02:19:17.020 --> 02:19:19.740]   It makes me feel like we're all connected,
[02:19:19.740 --> 02:19:22.100]   not just amongst humans and spatially,
[02:19:22.100 --> 02:19:25.580]   but in terms, back in time,
[02:19:25.580 --> 02:19:29.420]   there's a kind of eternal nature,
[02:19:29.420 --> 02:19:32.460]   like the timelessness, I guess, to life.
[02:19:32.460 --> 02:19:34.740]   It could be also a genetic thing just for me.
[02:19:34.740 --> 02:19:38.540]   I don't know if everyone agrees to this view of time,
[02:19:38.540 --> 02:19:40.500]   but to me, it all feels the same.
[02:19:40.500 --> 02:19:43.140]   - Like you don't feel the passage of time or?
[02:19:43.140 --> 02:19:44.300]   - No, I feel the passage of time
[02:19:44.300 --> 02:19:47.980]   in the same way that your students did from day to day.
[02:19:47.980 --> 02:19:52.060]   There's certain markers that let you know
[02:19:52.060 --> 02:19:55.060]   that time has passed, you celebrate birthdays and so on.
[02:19:55.060 --> 02:19:58.540]   But the core of who I am and who others I know are,
[02:19:58.540 --> 02:20:02.420]   or events, that compression of my understanding
[02:20:02.420 --> 02:20:06.140]   of the world removes time
[02:20:06.140 --> 02:20:08.260]   'cause time is not useful for the compression.
[02:20:08.260 --> 02:20:11.180]   So the details of that time, at least for me,
[02:20:11.180 --> 02:20:14.860]   is not useful to understanding the core of the thing.
[02:20:14.860 --> 02:20:17.940]   - Maybe what it is is that you really like
[02:20:17.940 --> 02:20:20.020]   to see connections between things.
[02:20:20.020 --> 02:20:23.520]   This is really what motivates me in science, actually, too.
[02:20:23.520 --> 02:20:26.100]   But it's like when you start recalling the past
[02:20:26.100 --> 02:20:30.660]   and seeing the connections between the past and present,
[02:20:30.660 --> 02:20:32.740]   now you have this kind of web
[02:20:32.740 --> 02:20:35.700]   of interconnected memories, right?
[02:20:35.700 --> 02:20:38.580]   And so I can imagine, in that sense,
[02:20:38.580 --> 02:20:41.420]   there is this kind of the present is with you, right?
[02:20:41.420 --> 02:20:44.420]   But what's interesting about what you said, too,
[02:20:44.420 --> 02:20:48.460]   that struck me is that your 16-year-old self
[02:20:48.460 --> 02:20:50.820]   was probably very complex.
[02:20:50.820 --> 02:20:52.740]   And by the way, I'm the same way,
[02:20:52.740 --> 02:20:54.420]   but it's like it really is the source
[02:20:54.420 --> 02:20:56.180]   of a lot of darkness for me.
[02:20:56.180 --> 02:21:01.220]   But when you can look back at,
[02:21:01.220 --> 02:21:04.900]   let's say you hear a song that you used to play
[02:21:04.900 --> 02:21:07.340]   before you would go do a sports thing
[02:21:07.340 --> 02:21:08.180]   or something like that,
[02:21:08.180 --> 02:21:09.820]   and you might not think of yourself as an athlete,
[02:21:09.820 --> 02:21:12.140]   but once you get back to that,
[02:21:12.140 --> 02:21:14.720]   you mentally time travel to that particular thing,
[02:21:14.720 --> 02:21:17.220]   you open up this little compartment of yourself
[02:21:17.220 --> 02:21:18.740]   that wasn't there before, right,
[02:21:18.740 --> 02:21:20.980]   that didn't seem accessible before.
[02:21:20.980 --> 02:21:23.700]   Dan Schachter's lab did this really cool study
[02:21:23.700 --> 02:21:25.580]   where they would ask people
[02:21:25.580 --> 02:21:29.900]   to either remember doing something altruistic
[02:21:29.900 --> 02:21:32.980]   or imagine doing something altruistic.
[02:21:32.980 --> 02:21:36.540]   And that act made them more likely
[02:21:36.540 --> 02:21:39.740]   to want to do things for other people.
[02:21:39.740 --> 02:21:43.140]   So that act of mental time travel
[02:21:43.140 --> 02:21:45.020]   can change who you are in the present.
[02:21:45.020 --> 02:21:46.220]   And we tend to think of,
[02:21:46.220 --> 02:21:48.240]   this goes back to that illusion of stability,
[02:21:48.240 --> 02:21:50.460]   and we tend to think of memory
[02:21:50.460 --> 02:21:52.020]   in this very deterministic way,
[02:21:52.020 --> 02:21:54.840]   that I am who I am because I have this past.
[02:21:54.840 --> 02:21:57.540]   But we have a very multifaceted past
[02:21:57.540 --> 02:22:00.560]   and can access different parts of it
[02:22:00.560 --> 02:22:02.780]   and change in the moment
[02:22:02.780 --> 02:22:06.460]   based on whatever part we want to reach for, right?
[02:22:06.460 --> 02:22:09.220]   - How does nostalgia connect into this,
[02:22:09.220 --> 02:22:14.220]   like this desire and pleasure associated with going back?
[02:22:14.220 --> 02:22:20.620]   - Yeah, so my friend Philippe DeBregaard wrote this,
[02:22:20.620 --> 02:22:23.260]   and it just like blew my mind,
[02:22:23.260 --> 02:22:26.820]   where the word nostalgia was coined by a Swiss physician
[02:22:26.820 --> 02:22:29.100]   who was actually studying traumatized soldiers.
[02:22:29.100 --> 02:22:32.420]   And so he described nostalgia as a disease.
[02:22:32.420 --> 02:22:34.500]   And the idea was it was bringing these people
[02:22:34.500 --> 02:22:36.240]   extraordinary unhappiness
[02:22:36.240 --> 02:22:38.740]   because they're remembering how things used to be.
[02:22:38.740 --> 02:22:42.900]   And I think it's very complex.
[02:22:42.900 --> 02:22:45.540]   So as people get older, for instance,
[02:22:45.540 --> 02:22:49.740]   nostalgia can be an enormous source of happiness, right?
[02:22:49.740 --> 02:22:52.540]   And being nostalgic can improve people's moods
[02:22:52.540 --> 02:22:53.860]   in the moment.
[02:22:53.860 --> 02:22:56.640]   But it just depends on what they do with it,
[02:22:56.640 --> 02:22:59.060]   because what you can sometimes see is,
[02:22:59.060 --> 02:23:01.460]   nostalgia has the opposite effect of thinking
[02:23:01.460 --> 02:23:04.220]   those were the good old days and those days are over, right?
[02:23:04.220 --> 02:23:07.700]   It's like America used to be so great and now it sucks.
[02:23:07.700 --> 02:23:11.140]   Or, you know, my life used to be so great when I was a kid
[02:23:11.140 --> 02:23:12.940]   and now it's not, right?
[02:23:12.940 --> 02:23:15.900]   And you're selectively remembering the things
[02:23:15.900 --> 02:23:18.080]   that we don't realize how selective
[02:23:18.080 --> 02:23:20.140]   our remembering self is.
[02:23:20.140 --> 02:23:22.600]   And so, you know, I lived through the '70s.
[02:23:22.600 --> 02:23:23.440]   It sucked.
[02:23:23.440 --> 02:23:26.900]   Partly it sucked more for me,
[02:23:26.900 --> 02:23:29.380]   but I would say that even otherwise,
[02:23:29.380 --> 02:23:31.580]   it's like there's all sorts of problems going on.
[02:23:31.580 --> 02:23:33.780]   Gas lines, people were like, you know,
[02:23:33.780 --> 02:23:37.660]   worried about like Russia, nuclear war, blah, blah, blah.
[02:23:37.660 --> 02:23:42.100]   So, I mean, it's just this idea that people have
[02:23:42.100 --> 02:23:45.220]   about the past can be very useful
[02:23:45.220 --> 02:23:48.100]   if it brings you happiness in the present,
[02:23:48.100 --> 02:23:50.580]   but if it narrows your worldview in the present,
[02:23:50.580 --> 02:23:54.080]   you're not aware of those biases that you have,
[02:23:54.080 --> 02:23:55.860]   you will end up, you can end up,
[02:23:55.860 --> 02:23:57.340]   it can be toxic, right?
[02:23:57.340 --> 02:24:01.160]   Either at a personal level or at a collective level.
[02:24:01.160 --> 02:24:04.020]   - Let me ask you both a practical question
[02:24:04.020 --> 02:24:05.620]   and an out there question.
[02:24:05.620 --> 02:24:07.420]   So, let's start with the more practical one.
[02:24:07.420 --> 02:24:11.460]   What are your thoughts about BCIs,
[02:24:11.460 --> 02:24:12.900]   brain computer interfaces,
[02:24:12.900 --> 02:24:15.440]   and the work that's going on with Neuralink?
[02:24:15.440 --> 02:24:17.620]   We talked about electrodes and different ways
[02:24:17.620 --> 02:24:18.860]   of measuring the brain,
[02:24:18.860 --> 02:24:21.280]   and here Neuralink is working on basically
[02:24:21.280 --> 02:24:22.900]   two-way communication with the brain.
[02:24:22.900 --> 02:24:24.500]   And the more out there question would be like,
[02:24:24.500 --> 02:24:25.500]   where does this go?
[02:24:25.500 --> 02:24:27.860]   But more practically in the near term,
[02:24:27.860 --> 02:24:29.660]   what do you think about Neuralink?
[02:24:29.660 --> 02:24:32.740]   - Yeah, I mean, I can't say specifics about the company
[02:24:32.740 --> 02:24:34.340]   'cause I haven't studied it that much,
[02:24:34.340 --> 02:24:36.760]   but I mean, I think there's two parts of it.
[02:24:36.760 --> 02:24:37.900]   So, one is they're developing
[02:24:37.900 --> 02:24:39.420]   some really interesting technology,
[02:24:39.420 --> 02:24:42.960]   I think with these surgical robots and things like that.
[02:24:42.960 --> 02:24:48.820]   BCI, though, has a whole lot of innovation going on.
[02:24:48.820 --> 02:24:52.620]   I'm not necessarily seeing any scientific evidence
[02:24:52.620 --> 02:24:54.740]   from Neuralink, and maybe that's just
[02:24:54.740 --> 02:24:55.820]   'cause I'm not looking for it,
[02:24:55.820 --> 02:24:58.660]   but I'm not seeing the evidence that they're anywhere near
[02:24:58.660 --> 02:25:00.700]   where the scientific community is.
[02:25:00.700 --> 02:25:01.820]   And there's lots of startups
[02:25:01.820 --> 02:25:03.860]   that are doing incredibly innovative stuff.
[02:25:03.860 --> 02:25:05.620]   One of my colleagues, Sergei Savitsky,
[02:25:05.620 --> 02:25:07.420]   is just like a genius in this area,
[02:25:07.420 --> 02:25:09.020]   and they're working on it.
[02:25:09.020 --> 02:25:13.100]   I think speech prosthetics that are incorporating,
[02:25:13.100 --> 02:25:15.260]   you know, decoding techniques with AI,
[02:25:15.260 --> 02:25:16.860]   and, you know, movement prosthetics,
[02:25:16.860 --> 02:25:21.380]   it's just like the rate of progress is just enormous.
[02:25:21.380 --> 02:25:24.820]   So, part of the technology is having good enough data
[02:25:24.820 --> 02:25:26.900]   and understanding which data to use
[02:25:26.900 --> 02:25:28.400]   and what to do with it, right?
[02:25:28.400 --> 02:25:30.780]   And then the other part of it, then,
[02:25:30.780 --> 02:25:33.780]   is the algorithms for decoding it and so forth.
[02:25:33.780 --> 02:25:35.960]   And I think part of that has really resulted
[02:25:35.960 --> 02:25:38.900]   in some real breakthroughs in neuroscience as a result.
[02:25:38.900 --> 02:25:43.220]   So, there's lots of new technologies like Neuropixels,
[02:25:43.220 --> 02:25:45.560]   for instance, that allow you to harvest activity
[02:25:45.560 --> 02:25:48.860]   from many, many neurons from a single electrode.
[02:25:48.860 --> 02:25:51.420]   I know Neuralink has some technologies
[02:25:51.420 --> 02:25:53.020]   that are also along these lines,
[02:25:53.020 --> 02:25:56.980]   but I haven't, again, because they do their own stuff.
[02:25:56.980 --> 02:25:59.340]   The scientific community doesn't see it, right?
[02:25:59.340 --> 02:26:03.940]   But I think BCI is much, much bigger than Neuralink,
[02:26:03.940 --> 02:26:07.300]   and there's just so much innovation happening.
[02:26:07.300 --> 02:26:09.280]   I think the interesting question,
[02:26:09.280 --> 02:26:11.060]   which we may be getting into,
[02:26:11.060 --> 02:26:13.460]   is I was talking to Sergei a while ago about, you know,
[02:26:13.460 --> 02:26:16.860]   so, a lot of language is not just what we hear
[02:26:16.860 --> 02:26:20.980]   and what we speak, but also our intentions
[02:26:20.980 --> 02:26:22.300]   and our internal models.
[02:26:22.300 --> 02:26:24.620]   And, you know, so are you really gonna be able
[02:26:24.620 --> 02:26:27.680]   to restore language without dealing with that part of it?
[02:26:27.680 --> 02:26:29.820]   And he brought up a really interesting question,
[02:26:29.820 --> 02:26:34.140]   which is the ethics of reading out people's intentions
[02:26:34.140 --> 02:26:36.400]   and understanding of the world,
[02:26:36.400 --> 02:26:39.140]   as opposed to the more, you know,
[02:26:39.140 --> 02:26:41.940]   the more concrete parts of hearing
[02:26:41.940 --> 02:26:43.740]   and producing movements, right?
[02:26:43.740 --> 02:26:44.700]   - Just so we're clear,
[02:26:44.700 --> 02:26:46.460]   'cause you said a few interesting things.
[02:26:46.460 --> 02:26:48.780]   When we talk about language and BCIs,
[02:26:48.780 --> 02:26:51.620]   what we mean is getting signal from the brain
[02:26:51.620 --> 02:26:54.380]   and generating the language,
[02:26:54.380 --> 02:26:56.320]   say you're not able to actually speak,
[02:26:56.320 --> 02:27:01.740]   it's as a kind of linguistic prosthetic.
[02:27:01.740 --> 02:27:06.740]   It's able to speak for you exactly what you wanted to say.
[02:27:06.740 --> 02:27:08.380]   And then the deeper question is,
[02:27:08.380 --> 02:27:12.820]   well, saying something isn't just the letters,
[02:27:12.820 --> 02:27:14.620]   the words that you're saying,
[02:27:14.620 --> 02:27:15.980]   it's also the intention behind it,
[02:27:15.980 --> 02:27:18.700]   the feeling behind it, all that kind of stuff.
[02:27:18.700 --> 02:27:21.820]   And is it ethical to reveal that full shebang,
[02:27:21.820 --> 02:27:25.660]   the full context of what's going on in our brain?
[02:27:25.660 --> 02:27:28.900]   That's really, that's really interesting.
[02:27:28.900 --> 02:27:29.740]   That's really interesting.
[02:27:29.740 --> 02:27:31.140]   I mean, our thoughts.
[02:27:31.140 --> 02:27:34.860]   Is it ethical for anyone to have access to our thoughts?
[02:27:34.860 --> 02:27:40.460]   Because right now the resolution is so low
[02:27:40.460 --> 02:27:41.460]   that we're okay with it,
[02:27:41.460 --> 02:27:43.580]   even doing studies and all this kind of stuff.
[02:27:43.580 --> 02:27:46.460]   But if neuroscience has a few breakthroughs
[02:27:46.460 --> 02:27:48.780]   to where you can start to map out the QR codes
[02:27:48.780 --> 02:27:52.220]   for different thoughts, for different kinds of thoughts,
[02:27:52.220 --> 02:27:56.660]   maybe political thoughts, you know, McCarthyism.
[02:27:56.660 --> 02:28:00.300]   What if I'm getting a lot of them communist thoughts
[02:28:00.300 --> 02:28:03.260]   or however we want to categorize or label it?
[02:28:03.260 --> 02:28:06.540]   That's interesting.
[02:28:06.540 --> 02:28:07.780]   That's really interesting.
[02:28:07.780 --> 02:28:10.420]   I think ultimately this always,
[02:28:10.420 --> 02:28:15.420]   the more transparency there is about the human mind,
[02:28:15.420 --> 02:28:18.140]   the better it is.
[02:28:18.140 --> 02:28:22.260]   But there could be always intermediate battles
[02:28:22.260 --> 02:28:25.500]   with how much control does a centralized entity have,
[02:28:25.500 --> 02:28:26.500]   like a government and so on.
[02:28:26.500 --> 02:28:27.620]   What is the regulation?
[02:28:27.620 --> 02:28:28.460]   What are the rules?
[02:28:28.460 --> 02:28:30.500]   What are the, what's legal and illegal?
[02:28:30.500 --> 02:28:32.340]   You know, if you talk about the police
[02:28:32.340 --> 02:28:36.260]   whose job is to track down criminals and so on,
[02:28:36.260 --> 02:28:38.020]   and you look at all the history,
[02:28:38.020 --> 02:28:41.300]   how the police could abuse its power
[02:28:41.300 --> 02:28:43.820]   to control the citizenry, all that kind of stuff.
[02:28:43.820 --> 02:28:46.340]   So people are always paranoid and rightfully so.
[02:28:46.340 --> 02:28:47.660]   It's fascinating.
[02:28:47.660 --> 02:28:49.380]   It's really fascinating.
[02:28:49.380 --> 02:28:51.540]   You know, we talk about freedom of speech,
[02:28:51.540 --> 02:28:54.940]   you know, freedom of thought,
[02:28:54.940 --> 02:29:00.400]   which is also a very important liberty
[02:29:00.400 --> 02:29:03.380]   at the core of this country and probably humanity,
[02:29:03.380 --> 02:29:05.380]   starts to get awfully tricky
[02:29:05.380 --> 02:29:08.420]   when you start to be able to collect those thoughts.
[02:29:08.420 --> 02:29:11.140]   But what I wanted to actually ask you is,
[02:29:11.140 --> 02:29:16.140]   do you think for fun and for practical purposes,
[02:29:16.140 --> 02:29:21.880]   you'll be able to, we would be able to modify memories?
[02:29:21.880 --> 02:29:26.540]   So how difficult is it to,
[02:29:26.540 --> 02:29:29.220]   how far away we are from understanding
[02:29:29.220 --> 02:29:30.760]   the different parts of the brains,
[02:29:30.760 --> 02:29:33.260]   everything we've been talking about,
[02:29:33.260 --> 02:29:36.540]   in order to figure out how could we adjust this memory
[02:29:36.540 --> 02:29:39.980]   at the crude level from unpleasant to pleasant?
[02:29:39.980 --> 02:29:43.860]   You talked about we can remember the mall and the people,
[02:29:43.860 --> 02:29:45.380]   like location of the people.
[02:29:45.380 --> 02:29:47.500]   Can we keep the people and change the place?
[02:29:47.500 --> 02:29:48.700]   Like this kind of stuff.
[02:29:48.700 --> 02:29:50.200]   How difficult is that?
[02:29:50.200 --> 02:29:51.660]   - Well, I mean, in some sense,
[02:29:51.660 --> 02:29:54.420]   we know we can do it just behaviorally, right?
[02:29:54.420 --> 02:29:55.260]   - Behaviorally, yes.
[02:29:55.260 --> 02:29:56.940]   - Just like tell you, give, you know,
[02:29:56.940 --> 02:29:58.540]   under certain conditions anyway,
[02:29:58.540 --> 02:30:00.620]   it can give you the misinformation
[02:30:00.620 --> 02:30:03.580]   and then you can change the people, places and so forth.
[02:30:03.580 --> 02:30:08.340]   On the crude level, there's a lot of work that's being done
[02:30:08.340 --> 02:30:11.060]   on a phenomenon called reconsolidation,
[02:30:11.060 --> 02:30:14.680]   which is this idea that essentially when I recall a memory,
[02:30:14.680 --> 02:30:18.460]   what happens is that the connections between the neurons
[02:30:18.460 --> 02:30:21.500]   and that cell assembly that give you the memory
[02:30:21.500 --> 02:30:25.980]   are going to be like more modifiable.
[02:30:25.980 --> 02:30:29.100]   And so some people have used techniques to try to like,
[02:30:29.100 --> 02:30:30.980]   for instance, with fear memories,
[02:30:30.980 --> 02:30:35.140]   to reduce that physical visceral component of the memory
[02:30:35.140 --> 02:30:36.860]   when it's being activated.
[02:30:36.860 --> 02:30:40.260]   Right now, I think I've, as an outsider looking at the data,
[02:30:40.260 --> 02:30:42.820]   I think it's like mixed results.
[02:30:42.820 --> 02:30:46.800]   And part of it is, and this speaks to the more complex issue,
[02:30:46.800 --> 02:30:51.800]   is that you need somebody to actually fully recall
[02:30:51.800 --> 02:30:54.680]   that traumatic memory in the first place.
[02:30:54.680 --> 02:30:57.860]   And in order to actually modify it,
[02:30:57.860 --> 02:30:59.500]   then what is the memory?
[02:30:59.500 --> 02:31:01.900]   That is the key part of the problem.
[02:31:01.900 --> 02:31:03.900]   So if we go back to reading people's thoughts,
[02:31:03.900 --> 02:31:05.700]   what is the thought?
[02:31:05.700 --> 02:31:08.300]   I mean, people can sometimes look at this like behaviorists
[02:31:08.300 --> 02:31:10.300]   and go, well, the memory is like,
[02:31:10.300 --> 02:31:12.180]   I've given you A and you produce B.
[02:31:12.180 --> 02:31:15.700]   But I think that's a very bankrupt concept about memory.
[02:31:15.700 --> 02:31:17.940]   I think it's much more complicated than that.
[02:31:17.940 --> 02:31:20.740]   And one of the things that when we started studying
[02:31:20.740 --> 02:31:23.560]   naturalistic memory, like memory from movies,
[02:31:23.560 --> 02:31:25.500]   that was so hard was we had to change
[02:31:25.500 --> 02:31:26.700]   the way we did the studies.
[02:31:26.700 --> 02:31:31.700]   Because if I show you a movie and I watch the same movie
[02:31:31.700 --> 02:31:34.940]   and you recall everything that happened
[02:31:34.940 --> 02:31:36.960]   and I recall everything that happened,
[02:31:36.960 --> 02:31:39.160]   we might take a different amount of time to do it.
[02:31:39.160 --> 02:31:41.040]   We might use different words.
[02:31:41.040 --> 02:31:42.580]   And yet to an outside observer,
[02:31:42.580 --> 02:31:45.380]   we might've recalled the same thing, right?
[02:31:45.380 --> 02:31:47.780]   So it's not about the words necessarily,
[02:31:47.780 --> 02:31:50.780]   and it's not about how long we spent or whatever.
[02:31:50.780 --> 02:31:54.220]   There's something deeper that is there that's this idea,
[02:31:54.220 --> 02:31:57.420]   but it's like, how do you understand that thought?
[02:31:57.420 --> 02:32:01.220]   I encounter a lot of concrete thinking that it's like,
[02:32:01.220 --> 02:32:06.020]   if I show a model, like the visual information
[02:32:06.020 --> 02:32:08.340]   that a person sees when they drive,
[02:32:08.340 --> 02:32:10.860]   I can basically reverse engineer driving.
[02:32:10.860 --> 02:32:13.380]   Well, that's not really how it works.
[02:32:13.380 --> 02:32:15.300]   I once saw a talk by somebody,
[02:32:15.300 --> 02:32:18.060]   or I saw somebody talking in this discussion
[02:32:18.060 --> 02:32:20.580]   between neuroscientists and AI people.
[02:32:20.580 --> 02:32:24.180]   And he was saying that the problem with self-driving cars
[02:32:24.180 --> 02:32:27.220]   that they had in cities, as opposed to highways,
[02:32:27.220 --> 02:32:31.580]   was that the car was okay at doing the things
[02:32:31.580 --> 02:32:34.620]   it's supposed to, but when there were pedestrians around,
[02:32:34.620 --> 02:32:37.500]   it couldn't predict the intentions of people.
[02:32:37.500 --> 02:32:40.920]   And so that unpredictability of people was the problem
[02:32:40.920 --> 02:32:44.180]   that they were having in the self-driving car design,
[02:32:44.180 --> 02:32:47.980]   'cause it didn't have a good enough internal model
[02:32:47.980 --> 02:32:51.480]   of what the people were, what they were doing,
[02:32:51.480 --> 02:32:53.060]   what they wanted.
[02:32:53.060 --> 02:32:54.380]   Now, what do you think about that?
[02:32:54.380 --> 02:32:56.660]   - Well, I spent a huge amount of time
[02:32:56.660 --> 02:33:01.220]   watching pedestrians, thinking about pedestrians,
[02:33:01.220 --> 02:33:03.820]   thinking about what it takes to solve the problem of
[02:33:03.820 --> 02:33:12.980]   measuring, detecting the intention of a pedestrian,
[02:33:12.980 --> 02:33:15.540]   really of a human being in this particular context
[02:33:15.540 --> 02:33:18.020]   of having to cross a street.
[02:33:18.020 --> 02:33:20.340]   And it's fascinating.
[02:33:20.340 --> 02:33:25.340]   I think it's a window into how complex social systems are
[02:33:25.340 --> 02:33:33.220]   that involve humans, because I would just stand there
[02:33:33.220 --> 02:33:36.420]   and watch intersections for hours.
[02:33:36.420 --> 02:33:38.660]   And what you start to figure out is
[02:33:38.660 --> 02:33:42.220]   every single intersection has its own personality.
[02:33:42.220 --> 02:33:44.620]   So there's a history to that intersection,
[02:33:44.620 --> 02:33:47.620]   like jaywalking, certain intersections,
[02:33:48.300 --> 02:33:52.020]   intersections allow jaywalking a lot more,
[02:33:52.020 --> 02:33:56.660]   because what happens is we're leaders and followers.
[02:33:56.660 --> 02:33:58.120]   So there's a regular, let's say,
[02:33:58.120 --> 02:33:59.740]   and they get off the subway,
[02:33:59.740 --> 02:34:01.620]   and they start crossing in red light,
[02:34:01.620 --> 02:34:03.900]   and they do this every single day.
[02:34:03.900 --> 02:34:05.180]   And then there's people that don't show up
[02:34:05.180 --> 02:34:06.380]   to that intersection often,
[02:34:06.380 --> 02:34:07.460]   and they're looking for cues
[02:34:07.460 --> 02:34:09.460]   of how we're supposed to behave here.
[02:34:09.460 --> 02:34:13.240]   And if a few people start to jaywalk and cross in red light,
[02:34:13.240 --> 02:34:15.820]   they will also, they will follow.
[02:34:15.820 --> 02:34:18.420]   And there's just a dynamic to that intersection.
[02:34:18.420 --> 02:34:19.900]   There's a spirit to it.
[02:34:19.900 --> 02:34:23.140]   If you look at Boston versus New York,
[02:34:23.140 --> 02:34:26.260]   versus a rural town, even Boston, San Francisco,
[02:34:26.260 --> 02:34:30.100]   or here in Austin, there's different personalities city-wide
[02:34:30.100 --> 02:34:32.740]   but there's different personalities area-wide, region-wide,
[02:34:32.740 --> 02:34:35.540]   and there's different personalities, different intersections.
[02:34:35.540 --> 02:34:37.260]   And it's just fascinating.
[02:34:37.260 --> 02:34:41.560]   For a car to be able to determine that is tricky.
[02:34:41.560 --> 02:34:44.380]   Now, what machine learning systems are able to do well
[02:34:44.380 --> 02:34:46.220]   is collect a huge amount of data.
[02:34:46.220 --> 02:34:50.980]   So for us, it's tricky because we get to understand the world
[02:34:50.980 --> 02:34:55.500]   with very limited information and make decisions grounded
[02:34:55.500 --> 02:34:58.380]   in this big foundation model that we've built
[02:34:58.380 --> 02:35:00.900]   of understanding how humans work.
[02:35:00.900 --> 02:35:04.220]   AI could literally, in the context of driving,
[02:35:04.220 --> 02:35:06.660]   this is where I've often been really torn
[02:35:06.660 --> 02:35:07.500]   in both directions.
[02:35:07.500 --> 02:35:09.900]   If you just collect a huge amount of data,
[02:35:09.900 --> 02:35:12.420]   all of that information,
[02:35:12.420 --> 02:35:15.660]   and then compress it into a representation
[02:35:15.660 --> 02:35:20.620]   of how humans cross streets, it's probably all there.
[02:35:20.620 --> 02:35:23.500]   In the same way that you have a Noam Chomsky who says,
[02:35:23.500 --> 02:35:25.900]   "No, no, no, AI can't talk,
[02:35:25.900 --> 02:35:27.740]   "can't write convincing language
[02:35:27.740 --> 02:35:30.620]   "without understanding language."
[02:35:30.620 --> 02:35:33.260]   And more and more, you see large language models
[02:35:33.260 --> 02:35:35.900]   without quote-unquote understanding
[02:35:35.900 --> 02:35:38.440]   can generate very convincing language.
[02:35:38.440 --> 02:35:40.620]   But I think what the process of compression
[02:35:40.620 --> 02:35:42.380]   from a huge amount of data compressing
[02:35:42.380 --> 02:35:47.180]   into a representation is doing is in fact understanding.
[02:35:47.180 --> 02:35:49.940]   Deeply, in order to be able to generate one letter
[02:35:49.940 --> 02:35:52.300]   at a time, one word at a time,
[02:35:52.300 --> 02:35:57.300]   you have to understand the cruelty of Nazi Germany
[02:35:57.300 --> 02:36:03.580]   and the beauty of sending humans to space.
[02:36:03.580 --> 02:36:05.060]   And you have to understand all of that
[02:36:05.060 --> 02:36:07.780]   in order to generate, I'm going to the kitchen
[02:36:07.780 --> 02:36:10.700]   to get an apple and do that grammatically correctly.
[02:36:10.700 --> 02:36:11.960]   You have to have a world model
[02:36:11.960 --> 02:36:13.700]   that includes all of human behavior.
[02:36:13.700 --> 02:36:16.100]   - You're thinking LLM is building that world model.
[02:36:16.100 --> 02:36:19.740]   - It has to in order to be good at generating
[02:36:19.740 --> 02:36:22.260]   one word at a time, a convincing sentence.
[02:36:22.260 --> 02:36:27.180]   And in the same way, I think AI that drives a car,
[02:36:27.180 --> 02:36:31.700]   if it has enough data, will be able to form a world model
[02:36:31.700 --> 02:36:33.520]   that will be able to predict correctly
[02:36:33.520 --> 02:36:35.260]   what a pedestrian does.
[02:36:35.260 --> 02:36:38.740]   But when we, as humans are watching pedestrians,
[02:36:38.740 --> 02:36:42.300]   we slowly realize, damn, this is really complicated.
[02:36:42.300 --> 02:36:45.420]   In fact, when you start to self-reflect on driving,
[02:36:45.420 --> 02:36:49.000]   you realize driving is really complicated.
[02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:52.820]   There's like subtle cues we take about like just,
[02:36:52.820 --> 02:36:55.460]   there's a million things I could say,
[02:36:55.460 --> 02:36:58.180]   but like one of them determining who around you
[02:36:58.180 --> 02:37:00.860]   is an asshole, aggressive driver, potentially dangerous.
[02:37:00.860 --> 02:37:02.420]   - Yes, yes, I was just thinking about this, yes.
[02:37:02.420 --> 02:37:03.260]   - Or like--
[02:37:03.260 --> 02:37:06.860]   - You can read it, once you become a great driver,
[02:37:06.860 --> 02:37:09.620]   you can see it a mile away, this guy is gonna pull
[02:37:09.620 --> 02:37:11.660]   an asshole move in front of you.
[02:37:11.660 --> 02:37:14.340]   He's like way back there, but you know it's gonna happen.
[02:37:14.340 --> 02:37:16.940]   - And I don't know what, 'cause we're ignoring
[02:37:16.940 --> 02:37:19.180]   all the other cars, but for some reason,
[02:37:19.180 --> 02:37:23.540]   the asshole, like a red, like a glowing obvious symbol
[02:37:23.540 --> 02:37:26.240]   is just like right there, even in the periphery vision.
[02:37:26.240 --> 02:37:29.260]   'Cause we're, again, we're usually when we're driving
[02:37:29.260 --> 02:37:32.100]   just looking forward, but we're like using
[02:37:32.100 --> 02:37:34.060]   the periphery vision to figure stuff out,
[02:37:34.060 --> 02:37:36.580]   and it's like a little puzzle that we're usually
[02:37:36.580 --> 02:37:39.660]   only allocating a small amount of our attention to,
[02:37:39.660 --> 02:37:41.540]   at least like cognitive attention to.
[02:37:41.540 --> 02:37:45.380]   And it's fascinating, but I think AI just has
[02:37:45.380 --> 02:37:47.780]   a fundamentally different suite of sensors
[02:37:47.780 --> 02:37:50.240]   in terms of the bandwidth of data that's coming in
[02:37:50.240 --> 02:37:53.660]   that allows you to form the representation
[02:37:53.660 --> 02:37:56.220]   and perform inference on the representation you,
[02:37:56.220 --> 02:37:58.780]   using the representation you form.
[02:37:58.780 --> 02:38:01.300]   That for the case of driving, I think it could be
[02:38:01.300 --> 02:38:04.100]   quite effective.
[02:38:04.100 --> 02:38:06.500]   But one of the things that's currently missing,
[02:38:06.500 --> 02:38:11.080]   even though OpenAI just recently announced adding memory,
[02:38:11.080 --> 02:38:15.500]   and I did wanna ask you like how important it is,
[02:38:15.500 --> 02:38:19.620]   how difficult is it to add some of the memory mechanisms
[02:38:19.620 --> 02:38:22.340]   that you've seen in humans to AI systems?
[02:38:22.340 --> 02:38:27.180]   - I would say superficially not that hard,
[02:38:27.180 --> 02:38:29.620]   but then in a deeper level, very, very hard,
[02:38:29.620 --> 02:38:31.980]   because we don't understand episodic memory, right?
[02:38:31.980 --> 02:38:34.620]   And so one of the ideas I talk about in the book
[02:38:34.620 --> 02:38:38.020]   is one of the oldest kind of dilemmas
[02:38:38.020 --> 02:38:39.460]   in computational neuroscience
[02:38:39.460 --> 02:38:41.220]   is what Steve Grossberg called
[02:38:41.220 --> 02:38:43.140]   the stability plasticity dilemma, right?
[02:38:43.140 --> 02:38:46.660]   When do you say something is new
[02:38:46.660 --> 02:38:48.660]   and overwrite your preexisting knowledge
[02:38:48.660 --> 02:38:51.020]   versus going with what you had before
[02:38:51.020 --> 02:38:52.660]   and making incremental changes?
[02:38:52.660 --> 02:38:57.660]   And so part of the problem with going through like massive,
[02:38:58.700 --> 02:38:59.980]   you know what I mean?
[02:38:59.980 --> 02:39:01.060]   Part of the problem of things
[02:39:01.060 --> 02:39:02.660]   like if you're trying to design an LLM
[02:39:02.660 --> 02:39:05.120]   or something like that is especially for English,
[02:39:05.120 --> 02:39:08.100]   there's so many exceptions to the rules, right?
[02:39:08.100 --> 02:39:11.460]   And so if you wanna rapidly learn the exceptions,
[02:39:11.460 --> 02:39:13.340]   you're gonna lose the rules.
[02:39:13.340 --> 02:39:14.940]   And if you wanna keep the rules,
[02:39:14.940 --> 02:39:17.620]   you have a harder time learning the exception.
[02:39:17.620 --> 02:39:21.500]   And so David Marr is one of the early pioneers
[02:39:21.500 --> 02:39:23.540]   in computational neuroscience.
[02:39:23.540 --> 02:39:27.460]   And then Jay McClelland and my colleague, Randy O'Reilly,
[02:39:27.460 --> 02:39:29.820]   some other people like Neil Cohen,
[02:39:29.820 --> 02:39:32.500]   all these people started to come up with the idea
[02:39:32.500 --> 02:39:35.020]   that maybe that's part of what we need
[02:39:35.020 --> 02:39:37.460]   in what the human brain is doing
[02:39:37.460 --> 02:39:39.400]   is we have this kind of a,
[02:39:39.400 --> 02:39:41.300]   actually a fairly dumb system,
[02:39:41.300 --> 02:39:44.900]   which just says this happened once at this point in time,
[02:39:44.900 --> 02:39:47.260]   which we call episodic memory, so to speak.
[02:39:47.260 --> 02:39:49.820]   And then we have this knowledge that we've accumulated
[02:39:49.820 --> 02:39:52.140]   from our experiences as semantic memory.
[02:39:52.140 --> 02:39:55.940]   So now when we want to,
[02:39:55.940 --> 02:39:58.500]   we encounter a situation that's surprising
[02:39:58.500 --> 02:40:01.100]   and violates all our previous expectations,
[02:40:01.100 --> 02:40:03.420]   what happens is is that now we can form
[02:40:03.420 --> 02:40:05.180]   an episodic memory here.
[02:40:05.180 --> 02:40:08.580]   And the next time we're in a similar situation, boom,
[02:40:08.580 --> 02:40:11.060]   we could supplement our knowledge with this information
[02:40:11.060 --> 02:40:12.980]   from episodic memory and reason about
[02:40:12.980 --> 02:40:15.100]   what the right thing to do is, right?
[02:40:15.100 --> 02:40:18.660]   So it gives us this enormous amount of flexibility
[02:40:18.660 --> 02:40:20.780]   to stop on a dime and change
[02:40:20.780 --> 02:40:25.300]   without having to erase everything we've already learned.
[02:40:25.300 --> 02:40:28.300]   And that solution is incredibly powerful
[02:40:28.300 --> 02:40:31.820]   because it gives you the ability to learn
[02:40:31.820 --> 02:40:34.460]   from so much less information really, right?
[02:40:34.460 --> 02:40:37.000]   And it gives you that flexibility.
[02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:39.820]   So one of the things I think that makes humans great
[02:40:39.820 --> 02:40:43.140]   is having both episodic and semantic memory.
[02:40:43.140 --> 02:40:46.740]   Now, can you build something like that?
[02:40:46.740 --> 02:40:49.460]   I mean, computational neuroscience people would say,
[02:40:49.460 --> 02:40:51.780]   well, yeah, you just record a moment
[02:40:51.780 --> 02:40:53.940]   and you just get it and you're done, right?
[02:40:53.940 --> 02:40:55.980]   But when do you record that moment?
[02:40:55.980 --> 02:40:57.260]   How much do you record?
[02:40:57.260 --> 02:40:58.980]   What's the information you prioritize
[02:40:58.980 --> 02:41:00.900]   and what's the information you don't?
[02:41:00.900 --> 02:41:02.300]   These are the hard questions.
[02:41:02.300 --> 02:41:04.140]   When do you use episodic memory?
[02:41:04.140 --> 02:41:06.240]   When do you just throw it away?
[02:41:06.240 --> 02:41:07.800]   And these are the hard questions
[02:41:07.800 --> 02:41:09.940]   we're still trying to figure out in people.
[02:41:09.940 --> 02:41:13.220]   And then you start to think about all these mechanisms
[02:41:13.220 --> 02:41:14.920]   that we have in the brain for figuring out
[02:41:14.920 --> 02:41:15.760]   some of these things.
[02:41:15.760 --> 02:41:17.980]   And it's not just one, but it's many of them
[02:41:17.980 --> 02:41:19.460]   that are interacting with each other.
[02:41:19.460 --> 02:41:22.300]   And then you just take not only the episodic
[02:41:22.300 --> 02:41:24.000]   and the semantic, but then you start to take
[02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:26.860]   the motivational survival things, right?
[02:41:26.860 --> 02:41:29.240]   It's just like the fight or flight responses
[02:41:29.240 --> 02:41:31.340]   that we associate with particular things
[02:41:31.340 --> 02:41:34.660]   or the kind of like reward motivation
[02:41:34.660 --> 02:41:37.420]   that we associate with certain things, so forth.
[02:41:37.420 --> 02:41:39.540]   And those things are absent from AI.
[02:41:39.540 --> 02:41:41.300]   I frankly don't know if we want it.
[02:41:41.300 --> 02:41:45.580]   I don't necessarily want a self-motivated LLM, right?
[02:41:45.580 --> 02:41:50.660]   And then there's the problem of how do you even
[02:41:51.540 --> 02:41:53.700]   build the motivations that should guide
[02:41:53.700 --> 02:41:55.940]   a proper reinforcement learning kind of thing,
[02:41:55.940 --> 02:41:59.660]   for instance, so a friend of mine, Sam Gershman,
[02:41:59.660 --> 02:42:02.180]   I might be missing the quote exactly,
[02:42:02.180 --> 02:42:05.340]   but he basically said, if I wanted to train
[02:42:05.340 --> 02:42:08.580]   like a typical AI model to make me as much money
[02:42:08.580 --> 02:42:11.620]   as possible, first thing I might do is sell my house.
[02:42:11.620 --> 02:42:15.620]   So it's not even just about having one goal
[02:42:15.620 --> 02:42:17.660]   or one objective, but just having all these
[02:42:17.660 --> 02:42:19.980]   competing goals and objectives, right?
[02:42:19.980 --> 02:42:22.500]   And then things start to get really complicated.
[02:42:22.500 --> 02:42:23.860]   - Well, it's all interconnected.
[02:42:23.860 --> 02:42:27.860]   I mean, just even the thing you've mentioned is the moment.
[02:42:27.860 --> 02:42:29.940]   You know, if we record a moment,
[02:42:29.940 --> 02:42:36.180]   it's difficult to express concretely what a moment is,
[02:42:36.180 --> 02:42:42.100]   like how deeply connected it is to the entirety of it.
[02:42:42.100 --> 02:42:45.540]   Maybe to record a moment, you have to make
[02:42:45.540 --> 02:42:47.460]   a universe from scratch.
[02:42:47.460 --> 02:42:49.580]   You have to include everything.
[02:42:49.580 --> 02:42:51.020]   You have to include all the emotions involved,
[02:42:51.020 --> 02:42:53.100]   all the context, all the things it built around it,
[02:42:53.100 --> 02:42:58.100]   all the social connections, all the visual experiences,
[02:42:58.100 --> 02:43:00.220]   all the sensory experience, all of that.
[02:43:00.220 --> 02:43:03.740]   All the history that came before that moment is built on.
[02:43:03.740 --> 02:43:06.620]   And we somehow take all of that and we compress it
[02:43:06.620 --> 02:43:09.940]   and keep the useful parts and then integrate it
[02:43:09.940 --> 02:43:13.260]   into the whole thing, into our whole narrative.
[02:43:13.260 --> 02:43:16.020]   And then each individual has their own little version
[02:43:16.020 --> 02:43:18.660]   of that narrative, and then we collide in a social way,
[02:43:18.660 --> 02:43:21.380]   and we adjust it, and we evolve.
[02:43:21.380 --> 02:43:22.220]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:43:22.220 --> 02:43:24.860]   I mean, well, even if we wanna go super simple, right?
[02:43:24.860 --> 02:43:27.740]   Like Tyler Bonnen, who's a post-doc
[02:43:27.740 --> 02:43:29.140]   who's collaborating with me,
[02:43:29.140 --> 02:43:34.140]   he actually studied a lot of computer vision at Stanford.
[02:43:34.140 --> 02:43:36.420]   And so one of the things he was interested in
[02:43:36.420 --> 02:43:38.860]   is some people who have brain damage in areas of the brain
[02:43:38.860 --> 02:43:41.100]   that were thought to be important for memory.
[02:43:41.100 --> 02:43:44.900]   But they also seem to have some perception problems
[02:43:44.900 --> 02:43:47.420]   with particular kinds of object perception.
[02:43:47.420 --> 02:43:48.980]   And this is super controversial,
[02:43:48.980 --> 02:43:51.420]   and some people found this effect, some didn't.
[02:43:51.420 --> 02:43:54.380]   And he went back to computer vision,
[02:43:54.380 --> 02:43:56.340]   and he said, "Let's take the best state-of-the-art
[02:43:56.340 --> 02:43:58.700]   "computer vision models, and let's give them
[02:43:58.700 --> 02:44:00.540]   "the same kinds of perception tests
[02:44:00.540 --> 02:44:02.820]   "that we were giving to these people."
[02:44:02.820 --> 02:44:04.380]   And then he would find the images
[02:44:04.380 --> 02:44:06.980]   where the computer vision models would just struggle,
[02:44:06.980 --> 02:44:09.460]   and you would find that they just didn't do well.
[02:44:09.460 --> 02:44:11.180]   Even if you add more parameters,
[02:44:11.180 --> 02:44:13.900]   you add more layers, on and on and on, it doesn't help,
[02:44:13.900 --> 02:44:15.300]   right, the architecture didn't matter,
[02:44:15.300 --> 02:44:16.980]   it was just there, the problem.
[02:44:16.980 --> 02:44:19.540]   And then he found those were the exact ones
[02:44:19.540 --> 02:44:21.740]   where these humans with particular damage
[02:44:21.740 --> 02:44:24.380]   to this area called the perirhinal cortex,
[02:44:24.380 --> 02:44:26.580]   that was where they were struggling.
[02:44:26.580 --> 02:44:30.580]   So somehow this brain area was important
[02:44:30.580 --> 02:44:32.080]   for being able to do these things
[02:44:32.080 --> 02:44:36.060]   that were adversarial to these computer vision models.
[02:44:36.060 --> 02:44:40.180]   So then he found that it only happened
[02:44:40.180 --> 02:44:42.580]   if people had enough time
[02:44:42.580 --> 02:44:44.780]   they could make those discriminations.
[02:44:44.780 --> 02:44:46.980]   But without enough time, if they just get a glance,
[02:44:46.980 --> 02:44:49.100]   they're just like the computer vision models.
[02:44:49.100 --> 02:44:50.340]   So then what he started to say was,
[02:44:50.340 --> 02:44:52.800]   "Well, maybe let's look at people's eyes," right?
[02:44:52.800 --> 02:44:55.780]   So a computer vision model sees every pixel all at once,
[02:44:55.780 --> 02:44:58.540]   right, it's not, you know, and we don't,
[02:44:58.540 --> 02:45:00.880]   we never see every pixel all at once.
[02:45:00.880 --> 02:45:02.540]   Even if I'm looking at a screen with pixels,
[02:45:02.540 --> 02:45:04.580]   I'm not seeing every pixel all at once.
[02:45:04.580 --> 02:45:08.140]   I'm grabbing little points on the screen
[02:45:08.140 --> 02:45:09.900]   by moving my eyes around
[02:45:09.900 --> 02:45:12.080]   and getting a very high-resolution picture
[02:45:12.080 --> 02:45:13.860]   of what I'm focusing on,
[02:45:13.860 --> 02:45:16.100]   and kind of a lower-resolution information
[02:45:16.100 --> 02:45:17.800]   about everything else.
[02:45:17.800 --> 02:45:20.140]   But I'm, I'm not necessarily choosing,
[02:45:20.140 --> 02:45:23.940]   but I'm directing that exploration
[02:45:23.940 --> 02:45:26.420]   and allowing people to move their eyes
[02:45:26.420 --> 02:45:28.060]   and integrate that information
[02:45:28.060 --> 02:45:29.860]   gave them something
[02:45:29.860 --> 02:45:33.420]   that the computer vision models weren't able to do.
[02:45:33.420 --> 02:45:37.100]   So somehow integrating information across time
[02:45:37.100 --> 02:45:40.260]   and getting less information at each step
[02:45:40.260 --> 02:45:42.580]   gave you more out of the process.
[02:45:42.580 --> 02:45:47.580]   - I mean, the process of allocating attention
[02:45:47.580 --> 02:45:52.780]   across time seems to be a really important process.
[02:45:52.780 --> 02:45:55.660]   Even the breakthroughs that you get
[02:45:55.660 --> 02:46:00.380]   with machine learning mostly has to do,
[02:46:00.380 --> 02:46:01.780]   attention is all you need.
[02:46:01.780 --> 02:46:04.080]   It's about attention, transform is about attention.
[02:46:04.080 --> 02:46:07.380]   So attention is a really interesting one,
[02:46:07.380 --> 02:46:12.380]   but then like, yeah, how you allocate that attention,
[02:46:12.500 --> 02:46:17.500]   again, is like, is at the core of like,
[02:46:17.500 --> 02:46:19.940]   what it means to be intelligent,
[02:46:19.940 --> 02:46:22.780]   what it means to process the world,
[02:46:22.780 --> 02:46:25.060]   integrate all the important things,
[02:46:25.060 --> 02:46:27.200]   discard all the unimportant things.
[02:46:27.200 --> 02:46:30.900]   Attention is at the core of it,
[02:46:30.900 --> 02:46:33.700]   it's probably at the core of memory too.
[02:46:33.700 --> 02:46:35.380]   'Cause there's so much sensory information,
[02:46:35.380 --> 02:46:36.700]   there's so much going on.
[02:46:36.700 --> 02:46:37.740]   There's so much going on.
[02:46:37.740 --> 02:46:39.900]   To filter it down to almost nothing
[02:46:39.900 --> 02:46:41.740]   and just keep those parts,
[02:46:41.740 --> 02:46:44.020]   and to keep those parts and then,
[02:46:44.020 --> 02:46:46.140]   whenever there's an error, to adjust the model
[02:46:46.140 --> 02:46:49.180]   such that you can allocate attention even better
[02:46:49.180 --> 02:46:52.620]   to new things that would result,
[02:46:52.620 --> 02:46:55.060]   maybe maximize the chance of confirming the model
[02:46:55.060 --> 02:46:56.700]   or disconfirming the model that you have
[02:46:56.700 --> 02:46:58.720]   and adjusting it since then.
[02:46:58.720 --> 02:47:01.660]   Yeah, attention is a weird one.
[02:47:01.660 --> 02:47:04.020]   I was always fascinated.
[02:47:04.020 --> 02:47:09.020]   I mean, I got a chance to study peripheral vision for a bit
[02:47:09.500 --> 02:47:11.980]   and indirectly study attention through that.
[02:47:11.980 --> 02:47:14.100]   It's just fascinating how humans,
[02:47:14.100 --> 02:47:15.900]   how good humans are at looking around
[02:47:15.900 --> 02:47:17.860]   and gathering information.
[02:47:17.860 --> 02:47:20.220]   - Yeah, at the same time, people are terrible
[02:47:20.220 --> 02:47:23.740]   at detecting changes that can happen in the environment
[02:47:23.740 --> 02:47:26.080]   if they're not attending in the right way,
[02:47:26.080 --> 02:47:29.100]   if their predictive model is too strong, you know?
[02:47:29.100 --> 02:47:31.420]   So you have these weird things where like,
[02:47:31.420 --> 02:47:33.460]   the machines can do better than the people.
[02:47:33.460 --> 02:47:35.220]   It's not that it's like, you know,
[02:47:35.220 --> 02:47:36.580]   so this is the thing is people go,
[02:47:36.580 --> 02:47:39.860]   oh, the machines can do this stuff that's just like humans.
[02:47:39.860 --> 02:47:43.100]   It's like, well, the machines make different kinds
[02:47:43.100 --> 02:47:45.340]   of mistakes than the people do.
[02:47:45.340 --> 02:47:48.580]   And I will never be convinced unless that, you know,
[02:47:48.580 --> 02:47:50.900]   we've replicated human,
[02:47:50.900 --> 02:47:52.700]   I don't even like the term intelligence
[02:47:52.700 --> 02:47:54.740]   'cause I think it's a stupid concept,
[02:47:54.740 --> 02:47:57.020]   but it's like, I don't think we've replicated
[02:47:57.020 --> 02:48:01.540]   human intelligence unless I know that the simulator
[02:48:01.540 --> 02:48:05.020]   is making exactly the same kinds of mistakes that people do
[02:48:05.020 --> 02:48:07.620]   'cause people make characteristic mistakes.
[02:48:07.620 --> 02:48:09.420]   They have characteristic biases.
[02:48:09.420 --> 02:48:11.940]   They have characteristic, like, you know,
[02:48:11.940 --> 02:48:13.420]   heuristics that we use.
[02:48:13.420 --> 02:48:16.360]   And those, I have yet to see evidence
[02:48:16.360 --> 02:48:18.740]   that CHAT-GPT will do that.
[02:48:18.740 --> 02:48:20.640]   - Since we're talking about attention,
[02:48:20.640 --> 02:48:23.420]   is there an interesting connection to you
[02:48:23.420 --> 02:48:26.500]   between ADHD and memory?
[02:48:26.500 --> 02:48:30.420]   - Well, it's interesting for me because when I was a child,
[02:48:30.420 --> 02:48:33.180]   I was actually told my school,
[02:48:33.180 --> 02:48:35.300]   I don't know if it came from a school psychologist.
[02:48:35.300 --> 02:48:37.640]   They did do some testing on me, I know,
[02:48:37.640 --> 02:48:39.460]   for like IQ and stuff like that.
[02:48:39.460 --> 02:48:43.100]   Or if it just came from teachers who hated me,
[02:48:43.100 --> 02:48:46.780]   but they told my parents that I had ADHD.
[02:48:46.780 --> 02:48:48.940]   And so this was, of course, in the '70s.
[02:48:48.940 --> 02:48:51.380]   So basically they said like, you know,
[02:48:51.380 --> 02:48:54.860]   he has poor motor control and he's got ADHD.
[02:48:54.860 --> 02:48:57.940]   And so, and, you know, there was social issues.
[02:48:57.940 --> 02:49:00.980]   So like I could have been put a year ahead in school,
[02:49:00.980 --> 02:49:04.300]   but then they said, oh, but he doesn't have the social,
[02:49:04.300 --> 02:49:06.620]   he doesn't have the social capabilities.
[02:49:06.620 --> 02:49:08.900]   So I still ended up being like, you know,
[02:49:08.900 --> 02:49:14.700]   an outcast, even in my own grade, but then like I was,
[02:49:14.700 --> 02:49:16.620]   so then my parents said, okay, well,
[02:49:16.620 --> 02:49:20.260]   they got me on a diet free of artificial colors and flavors,
[02:49:20.260 --> 02:49:21.340]   because that was the thing
[02:49:21.340 --> 02:49:22.740]   that people talked about back then.
[02:49:22.740 --> 02:49:25.020]   So I'm interested in this topic
[02:49:25.020 --> 02:49:27.460]   because I've come to appreciate now
[02:49:27.460 --> 02:49:29.860]   that I have many of the characteristics,
[02:49:29.860 --> 02:49:31.540]   if not, you know, full blown.
[02:49:31.540 --> 02:49:34.780]   It's like, I'm definitely time blindness,
[02:49:34.780 --> 02:49:37.620]   rejection sensitive, you name it, they talk about it.
[02:49:37.620 --> 02:49:39.500]   It's like impulsive behavior.
[02:49:39.500 --> 02:49:41.020]   I can tell you about all sorts of fights
[02:49:41.020 --> 02:49:44.260]   I've gotten into in the past, just you name it.
[02:49:44.260 --> 02:49:48.820]   But yeah, so ADHD is fascinating though,
[02:49:48.820 --> 02:49:50.780]   because right now we're seeing like
[02:49:50.780 --> 02:49:52.660]   more and more diagnosis of it.
[02:49:52.660 --> 02:49:55.660]   And I don't know what to say about that.
[02:49:55.660 --> 02:50:00.260]   I don't know how much of that is based on
[02:50:00.260 --> 02:50:04.660]   kind of inappropriate expectations, especially for children,
[02:50:04.660 --> 02:50:06.740]   and how much of that is based on true
[02:50:06.740 --> 02:50:10.660]   kind of like maladaptive kinds of tendencies.
[02:50:10.660 --> 02:50:11.900]   But what we do know is this,
[02:50:11.900 --> 02:50:14.860]   is that ADHD is associated with differences
[02:50:14.860 --> 02:50:16.860]   in prefrontal function,
[02:50:16.860 --> 02:50:20.580]   so that attention can be both more,
[02:50:20.580 --> 02:50:21.860]   you're more distractible,
[02:50:21.860 --> 02:50:24.140]   you have harder time focusing your attention
[02:50:24.140 --> 02:50:25.300]   on what's relevant.
[02:50:25.300 --> 02:50:26.700]   And so you shift too easily,
[02:50:26.700 --> 02:50:28.100]   but then once you get on something
[02:50:28.100 --> 02:50:30.820]   that you're interested in, you can get stuck.
[02:50:30.820 --> 02:50:34.740]   And so, you know, attention is this beautiful balance
[02:50:34.740 --> 02:50:37.580]   of being able to focus when you need to focus
[02:50:37.580 --> 02:50:39.820]   and shift when you need to shift.
[02:50:39.820 --> 02:50:43.100]   And so it's that flexibility plus stability again.
[02:50:43.100 --> 02:50:48.460]   And that balance seems to be disrupted in ADHD.
[02:50:48.460 --> 02:50:52.860]   And so as a result, memory tends to be poor in ADHD,
[02:50:52.860 --> 02:50:54.300]   but it's not necessarily because
[02:50:54.300 --> 02:50:56.940]   there's a traditional memory problem,
[02:50:56.940 --> 02:51:01.420]   but it's more because of this attentional issue, right?
[02:51:01.420 --> 02:51:05.780]   And so, and people with ADHD often will have great memory
[02:51:05.780 --> 02:51:08.260]   for the things that they're interested in,
[02:51:08.260 --> 02:51:10.060]   and just no memory for the things
[02:51:10.060 --> 02:51:11.460]   that they're not interested in.
[02:51:11.460 --> 02:51:14.060]   - Is there advice from your own life
[02:51:14.060 --> 02:51:17.060]   on how to learn and succeed from that?
[02:51:17.060 --> 02:51:20.780]   From just how the characteristics of your own brain
[02:51:20.780 --> 02:51:22.340]   with ADHD and so on,
[02:51:23.380 --> 02:51:25.220]   how do you learn?
[02:51:25.220 --> 02:51:29.900]   How do you remember information?
[02:51:29.900 --> 02:51:34.140]   How do you flourish in this sort of education context?
[02:51:34.140 --> 02:51:36.580]   - I'm still trying to figure out the flourishing per se,
[02:51:36.580 --> 02:51:39.460]   but education, I mean, being in science
[02:51:39.460 --> 02:51:42.420]   is enormously enabling of ADHD.
[02:51:42.420 --> 02:51:45.180]   It's like, you're constantly looking for new things,
[02:51:45.180 --> 02:51:47.420]   you're constantly seeking that dopamine hit,
[02:51:47.420 --> 02:51:50.460]   and that's great, you know?
[02:51:50.460 --> 02:51:53.860]   And they tolerate your being late for things.
[02:51:53.860 --> 02:51:56.300]   Nothing is really, nobody's gonna die if you screw up,
[02:51:56.300 --> 02:51:57.940]   you know, but it's nice.
[02:51:57.940 --> 02:51:59.540]   It's not like being a doctor or something
[02:51:59.540 --> 02:52:03.220]   where you have to be much more responsible and focused.
[02:52:03.220 --> 02:52:05.700]   You can just freely follow your curiosity,
[02:52:05.700 --> 02:52:06.860]   which is just great.
[02:52:06.860 --> 02:52:11.900]   But what I would say is that I'm learning now
[02:52:11.900 --> 02:52:14.460]   about so many things,
[02:52:14.460 --> 02:52:18.700]   like about how to structure my activities more,
[02:52:18.700 --> 02:52:23.460]   and basically say, "Okay, if I'm going to be,"
[02:52:23.460 --> 02:52:25.860]   email's like the big one that kills me right now.
[02:52:25.860 --> 02:52:29.980]   I'm just constantly shifting between email and my activities.
[02:52:29.980 --> 02:52:33.020]   And what happens is that I don't actually get the email.
[02:52:33.020 --> 02:52:34.860]   I just look at my email and I get stressed,
[02:52:34.860 --> 02:52:36.900]   'cause I'm like, "Oh, I have to think about this.
[02:52:36.900 --> 02:52:38.140]   "Let me get back to it."
[02:52:38.140 --> 02:52:39.340]   And I go back to something else,
[02:52:39.340 --> 02:52:43.180]   and so I've just got fragmentary memories of everything.
[02:52:43.180 --> 02:52:45.260]   So what I'm trying to do is set aside a time
[02:52:45.260 --> 02:52:46.620]   where I'm like, "This is my email time.
[02:52:46.620 --> 02:52:49.580]   "This is my writing time.
[02:52:49.580 --> 02:52:52.140]   "This is my goofing off time."
[02:52:52.140 --> 02:52:54.420]   And so blocking these things off,
[02:52:54.420 --> 02:52:56.140]   you give yourself the goofing off time.
[02:52:56.140 --> 02:52:59.420]   Sometimes I do that, and sometimes I have to be flexible
[02:52:59.420 --> 02:53:01.660]   and go like, "Okay, I'm definitely not focusing.
[02:53:01.660 --> 02:53:03.980]   "I'm going to give myself the downtime."
[02:53:03.980 --> 02:53:05.140]   And it's an investment.
[02:53:05.140 --> 02:53:06.620]   It's not like wasting time.
[02:53:06.620 --> 02:53:10.300]   It's an investment in my attention later on.
[02:53:10.300 --> 02:53:13.140]   - And I'm very much with Cal Newport on this.
[02:53:13.140 --> 02:53:16.100]   He wrote "Deep Work" and a lot of other amazing books.
[02:53:16.100 --> 02:53:18.580]   He talks about task switching
[02:53:18.580 --> 02:53:22.380]   as the thing that really destroys productivity.
[02:53:22.380 --> 02:53:27.060]   So switching, it doesn't even matter from what to what,
[02:53:27.060 --> 02:53:29.380]   but checking social media, checking email,
[02:53:29.380 --> 02:53:31.260]   maybe switching to a phone call,
[02:53:31.260 --> 02:53:32.780]   and then doing work, and then switching.
[02:53:32.780 --> 02:53:35.280]   Even switching between, if you're reading a paper,
[02:53:35.280 --> 02:53:38.900]   switching from paper to paper to paper,
[02:53:38.900 --> 02:53:43.700]   because curiosity and whatever the dopamine hit
[02:53:43.700 --> 02:53:46.300]   from the attention switch, limiting that,
[02:53:46.300 --> 02:53:48.700]   'cause otherwise your brain is just not capable
[02:53:48.700 --> 02:53:53.700]   to really load it in and really do that deep deliberation.
[02:53:53.700 --> 02:53:58.940]   I think that's required to remember things
[02:53:58.940 --> 02:54:00.900]   and to really think through things.
[02:54:00.900 --> 02:54:03.780]   - Yeah, I mean, you probably see this, I imagine,
[02:54:03.780 --> 02:54:05.820]   in AI conferences, but definitely
[02:54:05.820 --> 02:54:08.860]   in neuroscience conferences, it's now the norm
[02:54:08.860 --> 02:54:12.260]   that people have their laptops out during talks.
[02:54:12.260 --> 02:54:15.820]   And conceivably, they're writing notes.
[02:54:15.820 --> 02:54:18.700]   But in fact, what often happens if you look at people,
[02:54:18.700 --> 02:54:22.060]   and we can speak from a little bit of personal experience,
[02:54:22.060 --> 02:54:27.060]   is you're checking email, or I'm working on my own talk,
[02:54:27.060 --> 02:54:28.980]   but often it's like you're doing things
[02:54:28.980 --> 02:54:30.580]   that are not paying attention.
[02:54:30.580 --> 02:54:32.660]   I have this illusion, well, I'm paying attention,
[02:54:32.660 --> 02:54:33.940]   and then I'm going back.
[02:54:33.940 --> 02:54:36.620]   And then what happens is I don't remember anything
[02:54:36.620 --> 02:54:38.460]   from that day, it just kind of vanished.
[02:54:38.460 --> 02:54:40.580]   Because what happens is I'm creating
[02:54:40.580 --> 02:54:42.740]   all these artificial event boundaries.
[02:54:42.740 --> 02:54:45.740]   I'm losing all this executive function.
[02:54:45.740 --> 02:54:50.100]   Every time I switch, I'm getting a few seconds slower,
[02:54:50.100 --> 02:54:53.300]   and I'm catching up mentally to what's happening.
[02:54:53.300 --> 02:54:54.780]   And so instead of being in a model
[02:54:54.780 --> 02:54:57.020]   where you're meaningfully integrating everything
[02:54:57.020 --> 02:55:00.580]   and predicting and generating this kind of rich model,
[02:55:00.580 --> 02:55:02.860]   I'm just catching up, you know?
[02:55:02.860 --> 02:55:05.020]   And so yeah, there's great research
[02:55:05.020 --> 02:55:08.260]   by Melina Unkefer and Anthony Wagner on multitasking
[02:55:08.260 --> 02:55:10.700]   that people can look up that talks about
[02:55:10.700 --> 02:55:12.300]   just how bad it is for memory,
[02:55:12.300 --> 02:55:15.980]   and it's becoming worse and worse of a problem.
[02:55:15.980 --> 02:55:19.420]   - So you're a musician, take me through,
[02:55:19.420 --> 02:55:20.540]   how'd you get into music?
[02:55:20.540 --> 02:55:23.020]   What made you first fall in love with music,
[02:55:23.020 --> 02:55:24.740]   with creating music?
[02:55:24.740 --> 02:55:27.260]   - I, yeah, so I started playing music
[02:55:27.260 --> 02:55:31.740]   just when I was doing trumpet in school for a school band,
[02:55:31.740 --> 02:55:33.580]   and I would just read music and play,
[02:55:33.580 --> 02:55:36.180]   and it was pretty decent at it,
[02:55:36.180 --> 02:55:37.700]   not great, but it was decent.
[02:55:37.700 --> 02:55:40.020]   - How'd you go from trumpet to--
[02:55:40.020 --> 02:55:40.860]   - Guitar.
[02:55:40.860 --> 02:55:43.420]   - To guitar, especially the kind of music you're into?
[02:55:43.420 --> 02:55:46.060]   - Yeah, so basically in high school,
[02:55:46.060 --> 02:55:50.060]   yeah, so I kind of was a late bloomer to music,
[02:55:50.060 --> 02:55:53.420]   but just kind of MTV grew up with me.
[02:55:53.420 --> 02:55:54.940]   I grew up with MTV,
[02:55:54.940 --> 02:55:57.020]   and so then you started seeing all this stuff,
[02:55:57.020 --> 02:56:01.100]   and then I got into, metal was kind of like my early genre,
[02:56:01.100 --> 02:56:04.100]   and I always reacted to just things that were loud
[02:56:04.100 --> 02:56:07.540]   and had a beat like, you know, ADHD, right?
[02:56:07.540 --> 02:56:11.580]   It's like, you know, everything from Sgt. Pepper's
[02:56:11.580 --> 02:56:16.540]   by the Beatles to Led Zeppelin II, my dad had both,
[02:56:16.540 --> 02:56:18.100]   my parents had both those albums,
[02:56:18.100 --> 02:56:19.620]   so I listened to them a lot,
[02:56:19.620 --> 02:56:23.620]   and then like The Police, Ghost in the Machine,
[02:56:23.620 --> 02:56:25.540]   but then I got into metal, Def Leppard,
[02:56:25.540 --> 02:56:29.420]   and, you know, AC/DC, Metallica,
[02:56:29.420 --> 02:56:32.120]   went way down the rabbit hole of speed metal,
[02:56:32.120 --> 02:56:35.700]   and that time was kind of like,
[02:56:35.700 --> 02:56:37.380]   oh, why don't I play guitar?
[02:56:37.380 --> 02:56:40.260]   I can do this, and I had friends who were doing that,
[02:56:40.260 --> 02:56:42.340]   and I just never got it.
[02:56:42.340 --> 02:56:45.080]   Like, I took lessons and stuff like that,
[02:56:45.080 --> 02:56:47.900]   but it was different because when I was doing trumpet,
[02:56:47.900 --> 02:56:49.260]   I was reading sheet music,
[02:56:49.260 --> 02:56:51.940]   and this was like, I was learning by looking,
[02:56:51.940 --> 02:56:53.700]   there's a thing called tablature, you know this,
[02:56:53.700 --> 02:56:57.060]   where it's like you see a drawing of the fretboard
[02:56:57.060 --> 02:56:58.860]   with numbers, and that's where you're supposed to put your,
[02:56:58.860 --> 02:57:00.900]   it's kind of like paint by numbers, right?
[02:57:00.900 --> 02:57:05.440]   And so, I learned it in a completely different way,
[02:57:05.440 --> 02:57:07.740]   but I was still terrible at it,
[02:57:07.740 --> 02:57:11.620]   and I didn't get it, it's actually taken me a long time
[02:57:11.620 --> 02:57:13.420]   to understand exactly what the issue was,
[02:57:13.420 --> 02:57:16.260]   but it wasn't until I really got into punk,
[02:57:16.260 --> 02:57:18.620]   and I saw bands like, I saw Sonic Youth,
[02:57:18.620 --> 02:57:21.720]   I remember especially, and it just blew my mind,
[02:57:21.720 --> 02:57:24.180]   because they violated the rules
[02:57:24.180 --> 02:57:25.780]   of what I thought music was supposed to be.
[02:57:25.780 --> 02:57:28.360]   I was like, this doesn't sound right,
[02:57:28.360 --> 02:57:30.540]   these are not power chords,
[02:57:30.540 --> 02:57:33.580]   and this isn't just have like a shouty verse,
[02:57:33.580 --> 02:57:35.540]   and then a chorus part, it's not going,
[02:57:35.540 --> 02:57:39.940]   this is just like weird, and then it occurred to me,
[02:57:39.940 --> 02:57:42.780]   you don't have to write music
[02:57:42.780 --> 02:57:46.160]   the way people tell you it's supposed to sound.
[02:57:46.160 --> 02:57:47.460]   I just opened up everything for me,
[02:57:47.460 --> 02:57:48.820]   and I was playing in a band,
[02:57:48.820 --> 02:57:51.460]   and I was struggling with writing music,
[02:57:51.460 --> 02:57:53.580]   because I would try to write like,
[02:57:53.580 --> 02:57:56.700]   you know, whatever was popular at the time,
[02:57:56.700 --> 02:57:58.740]   and or whatever sounded like other bands
[02:57:58.740 --> 02:58:00.060]   that I was listening to,
[02:58:00.060 --> 02:58:03.380]   and somehow I kind of morphed into just like,
[02:58:03.380 --> 02:58:06.660]   just grabbing a guitar and just doing stuff,
[02:58:06.660 --> 02:58:08.460]   and I realized that part of my problem
[02:58:08.460 --> 02:58:10.780]   with doing music before was,
[02:58:10.780 --> 02:58:12.820]   I didn't enjoy trying to play stuff
[02:58:12.820 --> 02:58:13.780]   that other people played,
[02:58:13.780 --> 02:58:16.460]   I just enjoyed music just dripping out of me,
[02:58:16.460 --> 02:58:19.820]   and just, you know, spilling out and just doing stuff,
[02:58:19.820 --> 02:58:21.580]   and so then I started to say,
[02:58:21.580 --> 02:58:23.540]   what if I don't play a chord?
[02:58:23.540 --> 02:58:26.700]   What if I just play like notes that shouldn't go together,
[02:58:26.700 --> 02:58:28.660]   and just mess around with stuff?
[02:58:28.660 --> 02:58:30.900]   Then I said, well, what if I don't do four beats,
[02:58:30.900 --> 02:58:32.620]   go na-na-na-na, one-two-three-four,
[02:58:32.620 --> 02:58:34.380]   one-two-three-four, one-two-three-four,
[02:58:34.380 --> 02:58:36.180]   whatever I go, one-two-three-four-five,
[02:58:36.180 --> 02:58:37.780]   one-two-three-four-five,
[02:58:37.780 --> 02:58:39.620]   and started messing around with time signatures.
[02:58:39.620 --> 02:58:43.700]   Then I was playing in this band with a great musician
[02:58:43.700 --> 02:58:45.540]   who was really Brent Ritzel,
[02:58:45.540 --> 02:58:46.740]   who was in this band with me,
[02:58:46.740 --> 02:58:49.180]   and he taught me about arranging songs,
[02:58:49.180 --> 02:58:51.220]   and it was like, what if we take this part,
[02:58:51.220 --> 02:58:53.820]   and instead of make it go like back and forth,
[02:58:53.820 --> 02:58:55.180]   we make it like a circle,
[02:58:55.180 --> 02:58:57.780]   or what if we make it like a straight line,
[02:58:57.780 --> 02:58:59.420]   you know, or a zigzag, you know,
[02:58:59.420 --> 02:59:03.340]   just make it like non-linear in these interesting ways.
[02:59:03.340 --> 02:59:04.300]   And then the next thing you know,
[02:59:04.300 --> 02:59:08.100]   it's like the whole world sort of opens up as like the,
[02:59:08.100 --> 02:59:09.580]   and then what I started to realize,
[02:59:09.580 --> 02:59:11.940]   especially, so you could appreciate this as a musician,
[02:59:11.940 --> 02:59:14.140]   I think, so time signatures, right?
[02:59:14.140 --> 02:59:17.900]   So we are so brainwashed to think in 4/4, right?
[02:59:17.900 --> 02:59:20.900]   Every rock song you could think of almost is in 4/4.
[02:59:20.900 --> 02:59:22.620]   I know you're a Floyd fan,
[02:59:22.620 --> 02:59:24.700]   so think of "Money" by Pink Floyd, right?
[02:59:24.700 --> 02:59:25.540]   - Yeah.
[02:59:25.740 --> 02:59:29.220]   - ♪ Ba-na-na bum bum bum bum bum ♪
[02:59:29.220 --> 02:59:30.060]   - Yeah.
[02:59:30.060 --> 02:59:33.460]   - You feel like it's in 4/4 because it resolves itself,
[02:59:33.460 --> 02:59:37.060]   but it resolves on the last note of the,
[02:59:37.060 --> 02:59:40.780]   basically it resolves on the first note of the next measure.
[02:59:40.780 --> 02:59:43.060]   So it's got seven beats instead of eight
[02:59:43.060 --> 02:59:44.860]   where the riff is actually happening.
[02:59:44.860 --> 02:59:45.700]   - Interesting.
[02:59:45.700 --> 02:59:47.700]   - But you're thinking in four,
[02:59:47.700 --> 02:59:49.820]   because that's how we're used to thinking.
[02:59:49.820 --> 02:59:52.820]   So the music flows a little bit faster
[02:59:52.820 --> 02:59:54.700]   than it's supposed to,
[02:59:54.700 --> 02:59:56.940]   and you're getting a little bit of prediction error
[02:59:56.940 --> 02:59:59.300]   every time this is happening.
[02:59:59.300 --> 03:00:01.500]   And once I got used to that, I was like,
[03:00:01.500 --> 03:00:03.180]   I hate writing in 4/4
[03:00:03.180 --> 03:00:05.380]   because it was like, everything just feels better
[03:00:05.380 --> 03:00:08.740]   if I do it in 7/4 or if I alternate between 4 and 3
[03:00:08.740 --> 03:00:10.580]   and doing all this stuff.
[03:00:10.580 --> 03:00:12.500]   And then it's like, you just,
[03:00:12.500 --> 03:00:14.220]   jazz music is like that, you know,
[03:00:14.220 --> 03:00:17.100]   they just do so much interesting stuff with this.
[03:00:17.100 --> 03:00:18.580]   - So playing with those time signatures
[03:00:18.580 --> 03:00:22.020]   allows you to really break it all open and just,
[03:00:22.020 --> 03:00:23.540]   I guess there's something about that
[03:00:23.540 --> 03:00:25.620]   where it allows you to actually have fun.
[03:00:25.620 --> 03:00:26.460]   - Yeah, yeah.
[03:00:26.460 --> 03:00:28.940]   And it's like, so I'm actually like a very,
[03:00:28.940 --> 03:00:33.620]   one of the genres we used to play in was math rock,
[03:00:33.620 --> 03:00:34.460]   is what they called it.
[03:00:34.460 --> 03:00:36.460]   It was just like, there's just so many weird time signatures.
[03:00:36.460 --> 03:00:37.300]   - What is math?
[03:00:37.300 --> 03:00:38.140]   Oh, interesting.
[03:00:38.140 --> 03:00:39.180]   - Yeah, so.
[03:00:39.180 --> 03:00:42.900]   - That's the math part of rock is what,
[03:00:42.900 --> 03:00:45.220]   the mathematical disturbances of it or what?
[03:00:45.220 --> 03:00:46.260]   - Yeah, I guess it would be like,
[03:00:46.260 --> 03:00:47.820]   so instead of, you might go like,
[03:00:47.820 --> 03:00:50.380]   instead of playing four beats in every measure,
[03:00:50.380 --> 03:00:52.780]   na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, you go,
[03:00:52.780 --> 03:00:55.540]   na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na,
[03:00:55.540 --> 03:00:57.340]   you know, and just do these things.
[03:00:57.340 --> 03:00:59.620]   And then you might arrange it in weird ways
[03:00:59.620 --> 03:01:03.300]   so that there might be three measures of verse
[03:01:03.300 --> 03:01:07.260]   and then one, you know, and then five measures of chorus
[03:01:07.260 --> 03:01:08.180]   and then two measures.
[03:01:08.180 --> 03:01:10.020]   So you could just mess around with everything, right?
[03:01:10.020 --> 03:01:12.580]   - What does that feel like to listen to?
[03:01:12.580 --> 03:01:14.580]   There's something about symmetry
[03:01:14.580 --> 03:01:18.420]   or like patterns that feel good
[03:01:18.420 --> 03:01:20.500]   and like relaxing for us or whatever.
[03:01:20.500 --> 03:01:21.580]   It feels like home.
[03:01:21.580 --> 03:01:24.220]   And disturbing, that can be quite disturbing.
[03:01:24.220 --> 03:01:25.060]   - Yeah.
[03:01:25.060 --> 03:01:27.300]   - So is that, is that the feeling you would have
[03:01:27.300 --> 03:01:29.900]   if you were keep messing, if you were math rock?
[03:01:29.900 --> 03:01:32.700]   I mean, it's stressing me out just listening.
[03:01:32.700 --> 03:01:33.540]   - Well, yeah, yeah.
[03:01:33.540 --> 03:01:34.380]   - Learning about it.
[03:01:34.380 --> 03:01:35.460]   - So, I mean, it depends.
[03:01:35.460 --> 03:01:39.140]   So a lot of my style of songwriting
[03:01:39.140 --> 03:01:43.660]   is very much like in terms of like repetitive themes,
[03:01:43.660 --> 03:01:46.020]   but messing around with structure
[03:01:46.100 --> 03:01:48.700]   'cause I'm not a great guitarist technically.
[03:01:48.700 --> 03:01:50.820]   And so I don't play complicated stuff.
[03:01:50.820 --> 03:01:52.420]   And there's things that you can hear stuff
[03:01:52.420 --> 03:01:54.780]   where it's just like so complicated, you know?
[03:01:54.780 --> 03:01:59.620]   But often what I find is, is like having a melody
[03:01:59.620 --> 03:02:03.380]   or, and then adding some dissonance to it, just enough.
[03:02:03.380 --> 03:02:05.420]   And then adding some complexity
[03:02:05.420 --> 03:02:08.180]   that gets you going just enough.
[03:02:08.180 --> 03:02:09.580]   But I have a high tolerance
[03:02:09.580 --> 03:02:12.180]   for that kind of dissonance and prediction.
[03:02:12.180 --> 03:02:14.420]   And I think I have a theory, a pet theory
[03:02:14.420 --> 03:02:15.980]   that it's like basically you can explain
[03:02:15.980 --> 03:02:18.980]   most of human behavior is some people are lumpers
[03:02:18.980 --> 03:02:21.140]   and some people are splitters, you know?
[03:02:21.140 --> 03:02:24.860]   And so it's like some people are very kind of excited
[03:02:24.860 --> 03:02:26.180]   when they get this dissonance
[03:02:26.180 --> 03:02:27.620]   and they want to like go with it.
[03:02:27.620 --> 03:02:29.980]   And some people are just like, no, I want to lump every,
[03:02:29.980 --> 03:02:30.820]   you know, I don't know,
[03:02:30.820 --> 03:02:32.140]   maybe that's even a different thing.
[03:02:32.140 --> 03:02:33.700]   But it's like, basically it's like,
[03:02:33.700 --> 03:02:37.380]   I think some people get scared of that discomfort.
[03:02:37.380 --> 03:02:41.020]   And I really gravitate towards it, you know?
[03:02:41.020 --> 03:02:41.860]   - I love it.
[03:02:42.740 --> 03:02:44.660]   What's the name of your band now?
[03:02:44.660 --> 03:02:48.420]   - The cover band I play in is a band called Pavlov's Dogs.
[03:02:48.420 --> 03:02:53.420]   And so it's a band, unsurprisingly,
[03:02:53.420 --> 03:02:55.900]   of mostly memory researchers, neuroscientists.
[03:02:55.900 --> 03:02:56.740]   - I love this.
[03:02:56.740 --> 03:02:57.940]   I love this so much.
[03:02:57.940 --> 03:02:59.620]   - Actually, one of your MIT colleagues,
[03:02:59.620 --> 03:03:01.100]   Earl Miller, plays bass.
[03:03:01.100 --> 03:03:01.940]   - Plays bass?
[03:03:01.940 --> 03:03:03.980]   So you play, like, do you play a rhythm or a leader?
[03:03:03.980 --> 03:03:05.300]   - You could compete if you want.
[03:03:05.300 --> 03:03:06.300]   Maybe we could audition you.
[03:03:06.300 --> 03:03:07.140]   - For audition?
[03:03:07.140 --> 03:03:08.140]   Oh, yeah.
[03:03:08.140 --> 03:03:09.220]   I'm coming for you, Earl.
[03:03:09.220 --> 03:03:10.580]   (laughing)
[03:03:10.580 --> 03:03:13.540]   - Earl's gonna kill me.
[03:03:13.540 --> 03:03:15.060]   He's, like, very precise, though.
[03:03:15.060 --> 03:03:16.540]   - I'll play triangle or something.
[03:03:16.540 --> 03:03:18.460]   (laughing)
[03:03:18.460 --> 03:03:20.300]   Or the cowbell, yeah.
[03:03:20.300 --> 03:03:22.860]   I'll be the cowbell guy.
[03:03:22.860 --> 03:03:24.500]   What kind of songs do you guys do?
[03:03:24.500 --> 03:03:28.180]   - So it's mostly late '70s punk
[03:03:28.180 --> 03:03:31.580]   and '80s new wave and post-punk.
[03:03:31.580 --> 03:03:35.820]   Blondie, Ramones, Clash.
[03:03:35.820 --> 03:03:39.060]   I sing Age of Consent by New Order
[03:03:39.060 --> 03:03:40.340]   and Love Will Tear Us Apart.
[03:03:40.340 --> 03:03:41.940]   - You said you have a female singer now?
[03:03:41.940 --> 03:03:43.660]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, Carrie Hoffman
[03:03:43.660 --> 03:03:47.020]   and also Paula Croxon.
[03:03:47.020 --> 03:03:52.020]   And so they do, yeah, so Carrie does Blondie amazingly well.
[03:03:52.020 --> 03:03:55.220]   And we do, like, Gigantic by the Pixies.
[03:03:55.220 --> 03:03:56.860]   Paula does that one.
[03:03:56.860 --> 03:03:58.660]   - Which song do you love to play the most?
[03:03:58.660 --> 03:04:00.620]   What kind of song is super fun for you?
[03:04:00.620 --> 03:04:02.940]   - Of someone else's?
[03:04:02.940 --> 03:04:04.460]   - Yeah, cover, yeah.
[03:04:04.460 --> 03:04:05.300]   - Cover, okay.
[03:04:05.300 --> 03:04:07.380]   And it's one we do with Pavlov's Dogs.
[03:04:08.940 --> 03:04:12.540]   I really enjoy playing I Wanna Be Your Dog
[03:04:12.540 --> 03:04:14.020]   by Iggy and the Stooges.
[03:04:14.020 --> 03:04:14.860]   - Yeah, it's a good song.
[03:04:14.860 --> 03:04:17.180]   - Which is perfect 'cause we're Pavlov's Dogs.
[03:04:17.180 --> 03:04:18.180]   And Pavlov, of course,
[03:04:18.180 --> 03:04:20.300]   was like basically created learning theory.
[03:04:20.300 --> 03:04:22.020]   So, you know, there's that.
[03:04:22.020 --> 03:04:22.860]   But also it's like,
[03:04:22.860 --> 03:04:25.820]   but I mean, Iggy and the Stooges, that song,
[03:04:25.820 --> 03:04:27.060]   so I play and sing on it,
[03:04:27.060 --> 03:04:29.460]   but it's just like, it devolves into total noise.
[03:04:29.460 --> 03:04:33.580]   And I just like fall on the floor and generate feedback.
[03:04:33.580 --> 03:04:35.900]   I've like, I think in the last version,
[03:04:35.900 --> 03:04:37.780]   it might've been that or a Velvet Underground cover
[03:04:37.780 --> 03:04:39.580]   in our last show, I actually,
[03:04:39.580 --> 03:04:42.660]   I have a guitar made of aluminum that I got made.
[03:04:42.660 --> 03:04:44.700]   And I thought this thing's indestructible.
[03:04:44.700 --> 03:04:47.180]   And so I kind of like was just, you know,
[03:04:47.180 --> 03:04:48.100]   moving it around,
[03:04:48.100 --> 03:04:51.020]   had it upside down and all this stuff to generate feedback.
[03:04:51.020 --> 03:04:52.220]   And I think I broke one of the,
[03:04:52.220 --> 03:04:54.140]   I broke one of the tuning pegs.
[03:04:54.140 --> 03:04:54.980]   - Oh, wow.
[03:04:54.980 --> 03:04:58.740]   - Yeah, so I've managed to break an all metal guitar.
[03:04:58.740 --> 03:04:59.620]   Go figure.
[03:04:59.620 --> 03:05:02.180]   - A bit of a big, ridiculous question,
[03:05:02.180 --> 03:05:03.140]   but let me ask you,
[03:05:03.140 --> 03:05:05.580]   we've been talking about neuroscience in general.
[03:05:06.420 --> 03:05:07.980]   What do you,
[03:05:07.980 --> 03:05:11.500]   you've been studying the human mind for a long time.
[03:05:11.500 --> 03:05:15.140]   What do you love most about the human mind?
[03:05:15.140 --> 03:05:17.180]   Like when you look at it,
[03:05:17.180 --> 03:05:18.420]   we'll look at the fMRI,
[03:05:18.420 --> 03:05:21.060]   just the scans and the behavioral stuff,
[03:05:21.060 --> 03:05:24.380]   the electrodes, the psychology aspect,
[03:05:24.380 --> 03:05:26.540]   reading the literature on the biology side,
[03:05:26.540 --> 03:05:28.060]   neurobiology, all of it.
[03:05:28.060 --> 03:05:33.060]   When you look at it, what is most beautiful to you?
[03:05:33.060 --> 03:05:35.380]   - I think the most beautiful,
[03:05:35.380 --> 03:05:39.900]   but incredibly hard to put your finger on
[03:05:39.900 --> 03:05:43.060]   is this idea of the internal model.
[03:05:43.060 --> 03:05:45.420]   That it's like, there's everything you see,
[03:05:45.420 --> 03:05:47.940]   and there's everything you hear and touch and taste,
[03:05:47.940 --> 03:05:50.660]   you know, every breath you take, whatever.
[03:05:50.660 --> 03:05:55.660]   But it's all connected by this like dark energy
[03:05:55.660 --> 03:06:00.900]   that's holding that whole universe of your mind together.
[03:06:00.900 --> 03:06:04.020]   And without that, it's just a bunch of stuff.
[03:06:04.020 --> 03:06:06.500]   And somehow we put that together
[03:06:06.500 --> 03:06:11.500]   and it forms so much of our experience.
[03:06:11.500 --> 03:06:14.660]   And being able to figure out where that comes from
[03:06:14.660 --> 03:06:19.540]   and how things are connected to me is just amazing.
[03:06:19.540 --> 03:06:22.820]   But just this idea of like the world in front of us,
[03:06:22.820 --> 03:06:24.460]   we're only sampling this little bit
[03:06:24.460 --> 03:06:26.940]   and trying to take so much meaning from it.
[03:06:26.940 --> 03:06:30.660]   And we do a really good job, not perfect, I mean, you know.
[03:06:30.660 --> 03:06:34.020]   But that ability to me is just amazing.
[03:06:34.020 --> 03:06:36.100]   - Yeah, it's an incredible mystery, all of it.
[03:06:36.100 --> 03:06:37.380]   It's funny you said dark energy,
[03:06:37.380 --> 03:06:39.700]   'cause the same in astrophysics.
[03:06:39.700 --> 03:06:43.020]   You look out there, you look at dark matter and dark energy,
[03:06:43.020 --> 03:06:46.220]   which is this loose term assigned to a thing
[03:06:46.220 --> 03:06:50.780]   we don't understand, which helps make the equations work
[03:06:50.780 --> 03:06:53.100]   in terms of gravity and the expansion of the universe.
[03:06:53.100 --> 03:06:56.020]   In the same way, it seems like there's that kind of thing
[03:06:56.020 --> 03:06:59.500]   in the human mind that we're like striving to understand.
[03:06:59.500 --> 03:07:01.540]   - Yeah, yeah, you know, it's funny that you mentioned that.
[03:07:01.540 --> 03:07:03.900]   So one of the reasons I wrote the book, amongst many,
[03:07:03.900 --> 03:07:06.660]   is that I really felt like people needed to hear
[03:07:06.660 --> 03:07:10.900]   from scientists, and COVID was just a great example of this,
[03:07:10.900 --> 03:07:13.860]   because people weren't hearing from scientists.
[03:07:13.860 --> 03:07:16.300]   One of the things I think that people didn't get
[03:07:16.300 --> 03:07:20.580]   was the uncertainty of science and how much we don't know.
[03:07:20.580 --> 03:07:22.980]   And I think every scientist lives
[03:07:22.980 --> 03:07:24.700]   in this world of uncertainty.
[03:07:24.700 --> 03:07:28.900]   And when I was writing the book,
[03:07:28.900 --> 03:07:31.900]   I just became aware of all of these things we don't know.
[03:07:31.900 --> 03:07:33.980]   And so I think of physics a lot.
[03:07:33.980 --> 03:07:38.460]   I think of this idea of like overwhelming majority
[03:07:38.460 --> 03:07:40.580]   of the stuff that's in our universe
[03:07:40.580 --> 03:07:42.660]   cannot be directly measured.
[03:07:42.660 --> 03:07:44.580]   I used to think, ha-ha, I hate physics,
[03:07:44.580 --> 03:07:47.380]   so physicists get the Nobel Prize
[03:07:47.380 --> 03:07:48.940]   for doing whatever stupid thing,
[03:07:48.940 --> 03:07:50.820]   'cause it's like there's 10 physicists out there.
[03:07:50.820 --> 03:07:51.820]   I'm just kidding.
[03:07:51.820 --> 03:07:53.540]   Just disingenuous. - Strong words.
[03:07:53.540 --> 03:07:55.300]   - Yeah, no, no, no, I'm kidding.
[03:07:55.300 --> 03:07:56.980]   The physicists who do neuroscience
[03:07:56.980 --> 03:07:58.340]   could be rather opinionated,
[03:07:58.340 --> 03:07:59.740]   so sometimes I like to dish on that.
[03:07:59.740 --> 03:08:00.700]   - It's all love.
[03:08:00.700 --> 03:08:01.980]   - It's all love, that's right.
[03:08:01.980 --> 03:08:04.540]   This is the ADHD talking.
[03:08:04.540 --> 03:08:09.380]   But at some point I had this aha moment
[03:08:09.380 --> 03:08:14.340]   where I was like, to be aware of that much
[03:08:14.340 --> 03:08:17.700]   that we don't know and have a bead on it
[03:08:17.700 --> 03:08:19.500]   and be able to go towards it,
[03:08:19.500 --> 03:08:22.380]   that's one of the biggest scientific successes
[03:08:22.380 --> 03:08:23.940]   that I could think of.
[03:08:23.940 --> 03:08:26.140]   You are aware that you don't know
[03:08:26.140 --> 03:08:28.500]   about this gigantic section,
[03:08:28.500 --> 03:08:31.260]   overwhelming majority of the universe, right?
[03:08:31.260 --> 03:08:33.260]   And I think the more,
[03:08:33.260 --> 03:08:36.460]   what keeps me going to some extent
[03:08:36.460 --> 03:08:41.180]   is realizing, changing the scope of the problem
[03:08:41.180 --> 03:08:42.340]   and figuring out, oh my God,
[03:08:42.340 --> 03:08:44.460]   there's all these things we don't know,
[03:08:44.460 --> 03:08:46.460]   and I thought I knew this,
[03:08:46.460 --> 03:08:49.340]   'cause science is all about assumptions, right?
[03:08:49.340 --> 03:08:50.180]   So have you ever read
[03:08:50.180 --> 03:08:53.300]   "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions" by Thomas Kuhn?
[03:08:53.300 --> 03:08:54.140]   - Yes.
[03:08:54.140 --> 03:08:57.260]   - That's my only philosophy, really, that I've read.
[03:08:57.260 --> 03:08:59.740]   But it's so brilliant in the way
[03:08:59.740 --> 03:09:01.340]   that they frame this idea of,
[03:09:01.340 --> 03:09:03.780]   he frames this idea of assumptions
[03:09:03.780 --> 03:09:06.340]   being core to the scientific process,
[03:09:06.340 --> 03:09:07.340]   and the paradigm shift
[03:09:07.340 --> 03:09:10.020]   comes from changing those assumptions.
[03:09:10.020 --> 03:09:13.740]   And this idea of finding out this whole zone
[03:09:13.740 --> 03:09:15.900]   of what you don't know, to me,
[03:09:15.900 --> 03:09:18.300]   is the exciting part, you know?
[03:09:18.300 --> 03:09:20.940]   - Well, you are a great scientist
[03:09:20.940 --> 03:09:23.660]   and you wrote an incredible book,
[03:09:23.660 --> 03:09:25.420]   so thank you for doing that.
[03:09:25.420 --> 03:09:27.180]   And thank you for talking today.
[03:09:27.180 --> 03:09:32.100]   You've decreased the amount of uncertainty I have
[03:09:32.100 --> 03:09:35.380]   just a tiny little bit today
[03:09:35.380 --> 03:09:37.220]   and revealed the beauty of memory.
[03:09:37.220 --> 03:09:38.660]   This is a fascinating conversation.
[03:09:38.660 --> 03:09:39.660]   Thank you for talking today.
[03:09:39.660 --> 03:09:40.500]   - Oh, thank you.
[03:09:40.500 --> 03:09:43.420]   It's been a blast. (chuckles)
[03:09:43.420 --> 03:09:45.260]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[03:09:45.260 --> 03:09:46.980]   with Charan Ranganath.

[03:09:51.140 --> 03:09:53.140]   And now, let me leave you with some words
[03:09:53.140 --> 03:09:55.140]   from Haruki Murakami.
[03:09:55.140 --> 03:09:59.460]   "Most things are forgotten over time.
[03:09:59.460 --> 03:10:01.220]   "Even the war itself,
[03:10:01.220 --> 03:10:03.900]   "the life and death struggle people went through
[03:10:03.900 --> 03:10:06.980]   "is now like something from the distant past.
[03:10:06.980 --> 03:10:08.940]   "We're so caught up in our everyday lives
[03:10:08.940 --> 03:10:11.060]   "that events of the past are no longer in orbit
[03:10:11.060 --> 03:10:12.780]   "around our minds.
[03:10:12.780 --> 03:10:15.060]   "There are just too many things
[03:10:15.060 --> 03:10:16.900]   "we have to think about every day,
[03:10:16.900 --> 03:10:19.460]   "too many new things we have to learn.
[03:10:19.460 --> 03:10:22.980]   "But still, no matter how much time passes,
[03:10:22.980 --> 03:10:26.020]   "no matter what takes place in the interim,
[03:10:26.020 --> 03:10:29.780]   "there are some things we can never assign to oblivion,
[03:10:29.780 --> 03:10:32.460]   "memories we can never rub away.
[03:10:32.460 --> 03:10:36.260]   "They remain with us forever like a touchstone."
[03:10:36.260 --> 03:10:38.740]   Thank you for listening.
[03:10:38.740 --> 03:10:40.700]   I hope to see you next time.
[03:10:40.700 --> 03:10:43.300]   (upbeat music)
[03:10:43.300 --> 03:10:45.900]   (upbeat music)
