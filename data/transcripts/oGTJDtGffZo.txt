[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240]   I've always had something of a barbell portfolio.
[00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.500]   On the one hand, I take a lot of risk in equities over here, but then over here
[00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.200]   in my more liquid bucket is cash savings.
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.640]   And that's for any sort of rainy day fund or vacations or any other shorter
[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.360]   intermediate term thing that we're planning for, I think cash can become
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.520]   a gateway drug to market timing.
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.200]   You really have to make a definition in your, in your head of your
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.760]   portfolio of this cash is part of my overall asset allocation, or it's my
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.640]   emergency fund, or it's my intermediate term savings or whatever it is, if you
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.280]   don't have these, these things bucketed out, if you're just kind of going up
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.200]   about this without a plan and say, yeah, cash rates are high, I'm going to put
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.720]   all my money there and the stock market takes off, then what do you do?
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.440]   You have to have a plan of attack with that, whether that's cash is ever going
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.680]   to be invested, or if it's not, I think you can't just get stuck in the middle
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.600]   where you're trying to guess when a good time to put it back in the market is.
