[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   I'm Cal Newport and this is Deep Questions, episode 188.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:21.700]   I'm here in my Deep Work HQ joined by my much older producer, Jesse, who is in a completely
[00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.080]   different decade of life than I am.
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.080]   I am young and sprightly and in my 30s.
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.680]   Jesse is old and decrepit and in his 40s.
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.240]   I don't know how we even communicate with each other, Jesse.
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.920]   It's like completely different generations.
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.440]   I find it funny how you always call me professor on accident.
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.440]   You're my professor.
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.440]   Here's what type of day, by the way, for the viewing audience, is what type of day it's
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.440]   been.
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.720]   If you're not watching the YouTube version of our podcast, I'm holding up two different
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:52.720]   coffee cups.
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.600]   The first one is episode 187 coffee cup and I'm on the episode 188 coffee cup.
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.240]   I'm tired today so I got to power up.
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.000]   So hat tip to Bevco.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.400]   I don't know, Jesse, how have we not figured out some sort of dumb waiter system with the
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.280]   restaurant below us?
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:18.440]   It could be coffee during the taping and then immediately afterward, drinks.
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.720]   Just completely have those things.
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.320]   Yes, you usually have coaching to do after we record, but it's just going to make you
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.560]   more energetic.
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.560]   We should have that worked out.
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.080]   It's just they know when it's coming.
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.720]   If we make them our sole sponsor.
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.640]   Deep work HQ happy hour.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.640]   Exactly.
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.640]   Then the show would get lively.
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.640]   All right.
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.040]   Well, anyways, we've got a listener calls episode.
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.560]   Looking forward to it.
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:53.200]   But we're also now in April, which means we can do our tradition of reporting on the books
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.200]   I read the month before.
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.360]   So I want to report on the books I read in March.
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.080]   Twenty twenty two.
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:11.400]   As longtime listeners know, generally my goal is to aim for five books per month.
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.040]   And that's what I read in March of twenty twenty two.
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.040]   I mix genres.
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.040]   I mix difficulties.
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.760]   I want a variety of different books.
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:19.760]   So let's go through it.
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.120]   Here are the five books I read in March of twenty twenty two in order of completion.
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.680]   The first was Travels with George.
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:35.160]   This was written by the popular historian Nathaniel Philbrook.
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.720]   So Travels with George is a allusion to Steinbeck's Travels with Charlie.
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.660]   So if you're a Steinbeck person, you know, travels with Charlie Steinbeck is traveling
[00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.800]   with his dog, Charlie.
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.360]   Well, in Travels with George, Nathaniel Philbrook, who's written a series of books about the
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:58.080]   revolutionary era in America, went on a travel with his dog.
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.080]   And in particular, the dog was not named George.
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.640]   In this case, George is George Washington.
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:12.280]   And Philbrook and his wife and his dog trace the post inauguration tour of the newly formed
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.600]   country of America that George Washington went on.
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.080]   So he did a tour all the way through New England, and then he later did a tour all the way through
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.640]   the South.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.040]   And Philbrook retraced the steps of that tour in modern times and then went to these went
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.480]   to the spots and then mixed it in like with Steinbeck ask anecdotes about the journeys
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.620]   and his dog being a pain, etc.
[00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:35.920]   So I mean, here's the thing.
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:36.920]   The book was fine.
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:43.500]   I think the the contemporary the contemporaneous pieces about the dog, I didn't care.
[00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:51.180]   I mean, it's like two to upper middle age people with a dog and the dog gets dirty and
[00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.660]   it's hard to find hotels for them to stay.
[00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.120]   Like it wasn't that interesting.
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.120]   But the history is great.
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.260]   I'm a big fan of Philbrook's history.
[00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.140]   I mean, I would have been fine if this book really was just about George Washington's
[00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.060]   post inauguration tours and just honed in right on that.
[00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.300]   I kind of read pretty quickly in the in-betweens.
[00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.020]   I'm a big Philbrook fan.
[00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.860]   Here's what I like about Philbrook.
[00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:15.780]   I love writers who live in cool places and write full time and Philbrook who came to
[00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:16.780]   writing late.
[00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.180]   When I mean late, I'm talking about like Jesse's current decade of life.
[00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.180]   I'm talking about someone in the fort in their 40s.
[00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.180]   Right.
[00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.620]   Jesse is all of one day being 40.
[00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.660]   So we're talking people who largely we would rightly say have very little productive life
[00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:33.660]   left.
[00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.580]   But somehow at that point, and it's you know, it's hard for someone like me in my 30s again
[00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:39.940]   to really understand what that's like.
[00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:45.900]   But somehow at that point, he began writing in his 40s and his first book was Heart of
[00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.140]   the Sea about the ship Essex.
[00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.620]   So this was the ship that was the model for Moby Dick.
[00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:57.180]   So it was a fishing, a whaling boat that was rammed and sunk by a whale.
[00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.780]   And I want a great book.
[00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.940]   And some people survived in a life raft, like a boat, a whaling boat, and they were at sea
[00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.580]   forever and they ended up on an island.
[00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:06.820]   It's all a true story.
[00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.300]   That's how he like burst onto the scene of doing historical fiction writing.
[00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.540]   But he lives in Nantucket and that's what I think is cool.
[00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:19.540]   He lives in Nantucket where he's just a writer on this windswept, you know, island.
[00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.140]   And I always found that very romantic.
[00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.420]   But he was a great writer because he's a good he's a good archive guy.
[00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:28.500]   And you get a little bit of insight in this book about his methods, because in the contemporaneous
[00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:34.660]   parts, he's often hanging out with librarians and historical society curators.
[00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:38.820]   And you get a sense into what life is like writing that it's all about finding primary
[00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:44.340]   sources going to historical archives, going to libraries, pulling out these books that
[00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.580]   no one has seen in 75 years to try to piece together the context in which history happened.
[00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:49.580]   So I thought that was cool.
[00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:50.820]   So there you go.
[00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:51.820]   Good book.
[00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:52.820]   Guy lives on Nantucket.
[00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:56.220]   If you're going to read any Philbrook, start with Heart of the Sea.
[00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.340]   I also thought Mayflower was very good.
[00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.020]   Valiant Ambition is very good as well.
[00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.340]   So there are some recommendations for you.
[00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:03.340]   All right.
[00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:04.340]   Now we get a little bit weird.
[00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:05.340]   Not weird.
[00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:06.340]   But fantasy.
[00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:11.860]   And so we got to be careful here, Jesse, that I get all the names right.
[00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.180]   So I don't know exactly what path led me to this.
[00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:19.460]   I think because I had heard this book was appropriate for younger audiences.
[00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:23.580]   I might have been testing this out for my oldest son.
[00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.140]   But I have never read Ursula K. Le Guin.
[00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:31.900]   And I read her first Earthsea book, A Wizard of Earthsea.
[00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:36.340]   So it's a fantasy book written in the 60s.
[00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:39.940]   It has a lot of prescience towards Harry Potter, right?
[00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:45.220]   I mean, there's a young boy who goes to a school for wizards.
[00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:50.820]   But it's much more psychologically astute and sophisticated.
[00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:57.620]   It's not the tale of a boy who's meant to be a hero and has to discover it.
[00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:05.260]   But actually, the whole metaphor of the book is that through his pride, he unleashes essentially
[00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.100]   like a demon force in the world that is hunting him.
[00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:09.300]   And in the end, he has to hunt it down.
[00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:12.900]   So it's much more literary, much more using language and scene to try to convey a deeper
[00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:14.340]   reality.
[00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:18.700]   Not so plot-focused or expository as like a J.K.
[00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:21.700]   Rowling or like a George R.R. Martin.
[00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:26.620]   So actually like a really well-crafted book in the fantasy genre.
[00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.700]   And I thought it was quite good.
[00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:30.060]   I saw echoes of it.
[00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.300]   You certainly see echoes of it.
[00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:32.980]   To me, it wasn't Harry Potter.
[00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:39.900]   I was thinking more of Love Grossman and the Magicians, which has a similar sort of literary
[00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:46.820]   metaphorical darkness where they sort of unleash this creature from the magical-- I don't know.
[00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:51.900]   I forgot, dimension or something that literally like kills one of the kids at the breakbeaks
[00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:54.500]   at the school for wizards.
[00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:59.060]   And so clearly, Grossman must have been channeling Ursula K. Le Guin.
[00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:00.340]   But anyways, I liked it.
[00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:01.580]   I'm not going to let my son read it.
[00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:04.780]   I think it's a little more too sophisticated and dark for him.
[00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:06.940]   He's reading Harry Potter instead.
[00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:09.660]   But it was a good change of pace.
[00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:11.860]   I did enjoy it.
[00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:13.660]   Lots of good old-fashioned wizard names.
[00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:16.740]   It's all like these weird, crazy Dungeons and Dragons names.
[00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:20.700]   All right, copy refill.
[00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:22.540]   All right, book number three.
[00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:24.820]   Let's zig in a different direction.
[00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:30.460]   Every Good Endeavor by Timothy Keller.
[00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:35.580]   So Timothy Keller is the pastor of Redeemer Presbyterian Church in Manhattan.
[00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:40.820]   And he's a public communicator, effective public communicator.
[00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.820]   He's written a bunch of books that have done pretty well.
[00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:49.820]   At some point, someone sent me a bunch of his books.
[00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:51.380]   So I have a stack of his books.
[00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:52.820]   I pulled this off of the stack.
[00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:57.460]   The reason why I read it is Every Good Endeavor is coming from a Christian perspective.
[00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:05.220]   But it is a biblical perspective on work, the point of work, finding work that's
[00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:06.620]   significant to you.
[00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:10.140]   And I thought this would be something I should probably know.
[00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:16.220]   I should probably have this club in my bag, understanding biblical perspectives on work
[00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:17.700]   and passion and vocation.
[00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.500]   Because obviously I've written about this in the past.
[00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.460]   I'm doing this work now on the deep life.
[00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:26.340]   And so I was like, let me get the Christian biblical perspective on work.
[00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:28.380]   And so that's why I dived in that book.
[00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:29.380]   There's some good things in there.
[00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:31.900]   I mean, it was the pick and choose.
[00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:36.180]   But I mean, I think there were some interesting threads of thought that I hadn't come across
[00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:37.180]   before.
[00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:42.740]   And here's the most interesting, here's the headline, like a headline idea that comes
[00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:46.540]   out of that book, which probably puts it at odds with a lot of sort of elite discourse
[00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:55.380]   around work right now, is Keller finds like a really strong biblical justification for
[00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:59.700]   work as an intrinsic good.
[00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:06.300]   This is quite different than I think a lot of the anti-ambition, anti-productivity type
[00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:13.540]   philosophy that's going on now, which sees work as mainly like an exploitative activity
[00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:17.940]   to be tolerated at best and in a utopian society to be minimized.
[00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:25.980]   Keller comes at it basically saying God worked in Genesis and that's an argument for work
[00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:26.980]   as important.
[00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:31.340]   He also has a reading of Genesis that says the seventh day of rest.
[00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:37.780]   So God worked and then he rest is basically a biblical mythological recipe for human satisfaction
[00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:42.340]   in which you have the seasonality you need to, you need to work, but then you need to
[00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:43.460]   not let work be all consuming.
[00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:45.500]   You need to step back and rest and it's in that dance.
[00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:47.420]   And that's what God did during the first seven days.
[00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:49.500]   And that's supposed to be an instruction manual for life.
[00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:53.860]   And you see what Adam and Eve and like basically Genesis is like a whole manual for work.
[00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:59.220]   I mean, I think, you know, Karl Marx's head would explode if he read this because it's,
[00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:05.660]   you know, it's, it seems really different than a lot of sort of economic materialistic
[00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:07.900]   analyses from today, but wait, cool.
[00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:09.300]   It's cool to see.
[00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:13.620]   I love people taking big, like big swing thoughts on things that are drawing from interesting
[00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:14.620]   sources.
[00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:17.020]   So that was an interesting one.
[00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:24.520]   Then I read the abolition of man by C.S. Lewis.
[00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:25.740]   It's arguable.
[00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:27.900]   This is a book.
[00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:28.900]   I thought it was a book.
[00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:29.900]   I read it on Kindle.
[00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:33.420]   It's really a collection of three lectures delivered during the world war II.
[00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:36.860]   So it's pretty short, but let's call it a book.
[00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:38.420]   And I forgot how I came across this.
[00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:39.420]   I came across it somewhere.
[00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:40.940]   I was like, I should just read it.
[00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:41.940]   I just bought it and read it.
[00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:44.180]   You know, it took me two days just sort of reading it.
[00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:46.020]   It's not a long thing.
[00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:47.820]   And it's interesting.
[00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:53.700]   So supposedly this is this book quotation marks collection of speeches is, was very
[00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:56.220]   influential in the 20th century.
[00:11:56.220 --> 00:12:03.460]   It's a, it's an argument for values, basically having rooted values on which you build cultural
[00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:05.060]   soul social systems.
[00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:08.380]   It's an argument against subjectivism.
[00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:11.420]   This notion of all value is constructed.
[00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:17.220]   So it's basically like a preemptive rejection of what 30 years later would emerge in French
[00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:20.220]   postmodernism before that even existed.
[00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:27.100]   So I'm sure this book is not well appreciated by the modern Academy, but I think that's
[00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:29.220]   what made it interesting to read.
[00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:33.860]   And it's, it's, it's jargon free and very approachable, but I mean, you can basically
[00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:35.740]   really crudely summarize the argument.
[00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:42.060]   I hate to summarize it crudely, but he's basically making an argument that we have to be careful
[00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:45.220]   of the heartless man.
[00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:50.740]   The, the, the, by the heartless man, what he means is, or no, the man, not the heartless
[00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:51.860]   man, that's not the right wording.
[00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:55.340]   No, the right wording was the man without chest.
[00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:58.040]   But what he means by that is heartless.
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:05.380]   He says without a foundation of values, which the heart you, so in other words, like the
[00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:09.100]   values that you have, these moral intimations about these moral intuitions, that this seems
[00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:10.100]   right.
[00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:16.540]   You're just trying to use your brain to think through ethics and mediate, like, and control
[00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:18.740]   your gut, which is like, let's go, I'm mad.
[00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:19.820]   Let's go kill this person.
[00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:22.620]   I want that to have your, your animal instincts.
[00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:27.060]   And if you try to just tame that with just your brain, let's just come up with what makes
[00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:29.540]   sense from scratch.
[00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:33.820]   Let's do the, let's be like Kant and just try to construct a moral system from scratch.
[00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:35.620]   He's arguing that's not going to work.
[00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:38.700]   You have to ground it all in what you feel in your heart, this sort of these underlying
[00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:40.460]   truths.
[00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:44.220]   Lewis is a real, obviously a Christian apologist, but he writes this book outside of the context
[00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:45.220]   of Christianity.
[00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:47.380]   So he's trying to be religion agnostic.
[00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:48.380]   I mean, it's interesting.
[00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:51.260]   I mean, it's something for sure.
[00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:55.420]   I'm surprised we don't read it like it in a sort of standard, heavily postmodern influence
[00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:59.260]   academic culture, be a nice thing to assign to people to is like, and here is like a,
[00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:00.940]   like a very straightforward standard critique.
[00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:04.620]   And this is the, this is the tension between those two, the tension between those two things.
[00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:11.020]   Because of course the postmodern view would say there is no underlying value system that
[00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:13.500]   you're picking up through your metaphorical heart.
[00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:15.420]   It's all just constructed.
[00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:20.060]   It's all just systems that are constructed to support various supremacies and power relations.
[00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:24.260]   And C.S. Lewis, if he had been alive, would probably have an issue with that.
[00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:28.220]   So it was interesting to read, quick to read, no jargon, very approachable.
[00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:29.780]   All right, final book.
[00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:33.540]   And I mentioned this last week in last week's episodes.
[00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:38.940]   I actually drew some insights from this book was John McPhee's the fourth draft.
[00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:41.140]   So I'll point you towards last week's episodes.
[00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:44.660]   I think maybe one 85.
[00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:47.400]   I got in, I got into some details of some things I learned from the book.
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:48.400]   It's great.
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:56.860]   It's a John McPhee book about writing a little bit of memoir, a lot of craft, very interesting.
[00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:58.260]   You'll be impressed by McPhee.
[00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.540]   After you read it, you'll also be insanely jealous.
[00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:02.100]   Like, wait a second.
[00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:08.380]   You could have spent eight months just thinking about an article and then, you know, maybe
[00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:10.620]   at some point write it when it all feels right.
[00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:12.780]   Like it feels like a very, it feels like a very cool life.
[00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:13.780]   Like I can't be jealous.
[00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:14.780]   I can't complain.
[00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:15.780]   I write for the New Yorker.
[00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:19.340]   They're very generous in giving me flexibility and timing when I need it.
[00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:21.740]   And so I'm not, I'm not complaining.
[00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:23.720]   I'm saying this awesome.
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:24.720]   And John McPhee's awesome.
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:25.720]   It's a cool book.
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:29.860]   So if you're into nonfiction writing, you can get in a look inside the mind of a master.
[00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:30.860]   All right.
[00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:32.860]   So that's it for my five books.
[00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:33.980]   People like to know what you read.
[00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:34.980]   Give us one book, Jesse.
[00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:38.100]   What's one book you've read recently we should know about.
[00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:40.060]   I'm almost done with 4,000 weeks.
[00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:41.700]   Pulled it off your bookshelf actually.
[00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:42.700]   Oh yeah.
[00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:43.700]   All right.
[00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:46.020]   Well, what's your almost done with it review?
[00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:47.020]   I like it.
[00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:49.100]   I've been, you know, thinking about it.
[00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:53.460]   I think about time a lot anyway, but it's, it's good.
[00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:55.340]   I mean, you hear it mentioned all the time.
[00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:56.340]   Yeah.
[00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:57.340]   Ferris talks about it.
[00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:58.340]   You talk about it.
[00:15:58.340 --> 00:15:59.340]   Other podcasts talk about it.
[00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:00.340]   Yeah.
[00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:01.340]   Yeah.
[00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:02.340]   Yeah.
[00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:03.340]   I mean, I think that's, I think that's, I think that's great.
[00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:04.340]   Ferris always forgets his name.
[00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:05.340]   Do you notice that?
[00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:06.340]   What does he call him?
[00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:07.340]   He just always like 4,000 weeks and.
[00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:14.780]   Well, I messed up the book on Ferris's show, so I called it 4,000, like 40,000 days or
[00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:15.780]   something.
[00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:16.780]   So Oliver, we're all sorry.
[00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:20.740]   I don't, there's nothing particularly hard to remember about your name or the, actually
[00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:22.780]   a book title, that's a number can be difficult.
[00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:25.100]   Once you're like in the four digits, that can be difficult.
[00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:28.460]   So I'm going to give myself a, give myself a break.
[00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:29.980]   But yeah, that's a great book.
[00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:30.980]   It's blurbed by me.
[00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:31.980]   So, you know, it's good.
[00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:32.980]   Yup.
[00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:33.980]   That's how you can tell.
[00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:34.980]   All right.
[00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:35.980]   So we got some calls, right, Jesse?
[00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:36.980]   We sure do.
[00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:37.980]   All right.
[00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:38.980]   What do we got first?
[00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:39.980]   All right.
[00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:40.980]   First call.
[00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:44.460]   He actually, speaking of which, he came across you and your Ferris interview a couple of
[00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:45.460]   months ago.
[00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:47.660]   And he has a question about your frameworks.
[00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:51.260]   Hi Cal, this is Mike.
[00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:56.380]   I've been listening to your podcast ever since your interview with Tim Ferris.
[00:16:56.380 --> 00:17:02.900]   I'd be interesting knowing the origins or the frameworks and how they were built since
[00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:09.260]   some of them seem familiar based on my work with the seven habits of highly effective
[00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.260]   people from the nineties.
[00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:12.260]   Thanks.
[00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:15.940]   Well, Mike, it's a good question.
[00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:21.020]   Covey is very influential, I would say on my thinking.
[00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:24.780]   Seven habits of highly effective people, by the way, has sold, and I believe this is the
[00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:28.260]   official term, all the copies.
[00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.380]   It's like 20 million copies or something.
[00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:34.680]   It's a crazily good selling book.
[00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:38.580]   And one of my arguments is the reason why that book sold so well is not because it was
[00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:43.320]   the first book to talk about productivity or time management.
[00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:44.320]   Those books have been around.
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:50.580]   In fact, I have in my collection, I went back and tried to find the earliest business oriented
[00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:52.220]   time management book that I could.
[00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:56.740]   And I actually have, I don't know if it's a first edition, but it's a 1950s edition
[00:17:56.740 --> 00:18:02.740]   of a book that's called, I don't know, time, something time power or something like
[00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:09.380]   this, but it's like one of the very first books to introduce the idea that time is something
[00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:11.180]   you have to have a strategy for managing.
[00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:14.540]   So this idea had been around for a while, seven habits of highly effective people.
[00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:16.220]   This is the eighties, I think late eighties.
[00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:17.220]   I don't think it's early nineties.
[00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:18.220]   I think it's late eighties.
[00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:20.260]   I could be wrong on that, but somewhere around them.
[00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:21.860]   And it came in and sold all the copies.
[00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:25.860]   And I think it's because it was not that it was a big time management book, but because
[00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:31.800]   it was connecting productivity and time management to values and the life well lived.
[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:33.220]   People miss this about Cubby.
[00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:35.760]   They're like, Oh, it's a big seven.
[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:42.980]   So it must be like tips, you know, one of those type of books, 19 ways to maximize your
[00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:44.020]   effectiveness, right?
[00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:49.540]   So it's dismissed by people who don't know it well as a tip guide, something that got
[00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:54.140]   a really good title, just like people will dismiss Tim Ferriss by being like the four
[00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:58.340]   hour work week is just like this really catchy name as if like that name alone is going to
[00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:02.340]   sell 4 million books, you know, like as if Ferris wasn't touching on something deep and
[00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:03.660]   what Cubby gets to in that book.
[00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:08.100]   And which I think is Mike is pointing out is reflected in my deep life philosophy is
[00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:12.540]   he has one of his key ideas is start with the end in mind.
[00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:16.900]   He has you figure out what your values are, what matters to you in your life, and then
[00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:23.620]   use that trickle down from that to actually guide how you execute in your life.
[00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:27.160]   And if you read first things first, which is the followup book, which elaborates on
[00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:31.740]   some of these ideas, he gets really specific about like, what are the roles in your life?
[00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:36.300]   You're a father, you're an executive at this company, you're a leader at your church or
[00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:38.120]   like whatever they were.
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:40.780]   And for each of these, you're trying to figure out what are your values and what are your
[00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:44.860]   important and then you work backwards from that to make sure that those values are reflected
[00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:46.260]   in how you're spending your time.
[00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:48.340]   And this is a lot of Stephen Cubby.
[00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:52.980]   A lot of it is how do you allocate your time to support the things that you care most about
[00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:56.180]   so that your life is one that reflects your values.
[00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:58.540]   That's why that book sold all the copies.
[00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:04.780]   Because this landed in the eighties when we were in this weird interstitial period out
[00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:09.740]   of the post-war boom, just out of the Carter era malaise.
[00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:11.740]   It was very materialistic.
[00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:13.120]   This was the era of Wall Street.
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:17.780]   This was the era of high consumerism and people were adrift.
[00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:20.820]   And then he came in and said, we should care about what you want to do, what's important
[00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:21.820]   to you in your life.
[00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:25.440]   And that should percolate all the way down to what am I doing today?
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:27.680]   And so I think that's why that book is effective.
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:29.880]   Clearly that influenced me.
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:35.880]   The deep life owes its foundations to that Cubby-like perspective.
[00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:39.680]   Start with the end in mind and then use that to work backwards to engineer your life.
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:42.800]   Of course, all the details that matter, I'm much more systems oriented.
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:49.080]   I've sort of merged some Covey value-based thinking with some David Allen systems-based
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:50.080]   thinking.
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:55.080]   I'm kind of merging those two worlds and then thrown in some neuroscience and psychology
[00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:56.080]   to boot.
[00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:58.440]   So I've created my own brew, but I do give Covey a lot of credit.
[00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:04.960]   So Mike, that's a good point you noticed because I think that's accurate.
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:07.280]   Certainly Covey played a role.
[00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:13.800]   All right, before we go to the next question, I figure we should probably take a moment
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:19.440]   to thank one or two of the sponsors that allows us to keep talking about these things.
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:26.680]   I have a stack of sponsor reads on the ground.
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:29.040]   That's how you know we're a high class production here.
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:30.040]   Okay.
[00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:34.040]   I had thrown them on the ground in a fit of anger.
[00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:36.400]   I threw my sponsor reads on the ground, but I now have them back.
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:40.840]   But I'll tell you what's one sponsor I'm not angry about, but actually quite excited about.
[00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:43.060]   And that is Workable.
[00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:49.040]   As we talked about in Monday's episode, there are a few things more important in running
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:53.360]   your company or business than hiring the right people.
[00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:56.560]   I know this from experience.
[00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:00.920]   There has been nothing worse for our company than when I hired Jesse.
[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:02.720]   It's all been downhill.
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:03.720]   You know why?
[00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:04.720]   Because I didn't use Workable.
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.280]   This is what happens.
[00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:15.280]   I end up with an old man, 40 plus years old, the fourth decade of his life, not a young
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:18.280]   go-getter with energy.
[00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:20.160]   And that's because I didn't use Workable.
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:21.160]   So that's the-
[00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:22.160]   You used the net.
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:25.960]   I put a net in the bookstore next to business advice books.
[00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:31.040]   If someone picked up a Stephen Covey book, it was like a snare release.
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:32.720]   And then the net caught you.
[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:37.720]   The first two people that sprung on, I ended up accidentally strangling with the net.
[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:41.480]   So then, but I perfected it by the time I got Jesse.
[00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:45.720]   No, Jesse is not, he is a valued part of the team, but he would have been even easier to
[00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:48.400]   hire if I had had Workable.
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.720]   Workable makes it easy to hire.
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:53.960]   They do a lot of things to make the process go smoothly.
[00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:58.240]   So you get your job posting out to all the top job boards with a 200 with just one click.
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:02.480]   But then, and this is the key to Workable, they have all these tools to make what happens
[00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:03.960]   next more efficient.
[00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:06.440]   They have video interview tools.
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:11.240]   You can schedule interviews automatically with tools, e-signature tools, like all the
[00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:12.240]   stuff that's annoying.
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:16.320]   The 100 back and forth emails Workable makes faster.
[00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:18.640]   So you don't have to waste time on the details.
[00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:20.520]   You can focus on just finding the right people.
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:24.400]   So you can start hiring today with a risk-free 15 day trial.
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:28.040]   And if you hire during the trial, it won't cost you a thing.
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:31.760]   Just go to workable.com/podcast to start hiring.
[00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:37.320]   Speaking of hiring, if you are worried about potentially being, let's say, accidentally
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:42.360]   strangled in my net at the bookstore, you probably need some life insurance.
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:45.600]   And even if you're not worried about that, you definitely need life insurance.
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:46.600]   Okay?
[00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:49.840]   If someone is relying on you for financial support, whether it's a child, aging parent
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:52.360]   or business partner, you need life insurance.
[00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:56.280]   This is stressful for people because they know it, but they're not quite sure how to
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:57.280]   start.
[00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:58.780]   Where do you even go to find life insurance?
[00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:01.360]   How do I know how much I should pay?
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:05.080]   Your answer is PolicyGenius.

[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:03.720]   All right.
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:10.800]   So I don't know, Jesse, maybe we should make a note.
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:12.760]   Warning people about being strangled in a net.
[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:14.640]   Maybe that's not how we should start our ad reads.
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:20.200]   I'm learning on the fly here, but this is my guess.
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:21.200]   We're working on it.
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:24.840]   I didn't actually strangle people in a net, and PolicyGenius is great.
[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:29.760]   All right, so now what I have is a giant, this is a giant pile of papers.
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:30.760]   We're so old-fashioned here.
[00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:38.160]   So people who are watching the video just see that I am swamped in paper, essentially.
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:39.760]   Everything here is run on paper.
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:45.800]   I guess that's what you'd expect, perhaps, from someone like me, a digital minimalist.
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:48.240]   But I think we're good.
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:49.240]   All papers have been organized.
[00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:50.240]   Jesse, let's do another question.
[00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:51.240]   What do we have here?
[00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:52.240]   - Hi, this is exciting.
[00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:57.280]   We have a pro golfer who's a fan of you, and he's been time blocking during his work and
[00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:02.440]   training sessions, but he has a question of whether he should time block outside of that.
[00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:03.440]   - Hi, Cal.
[00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:05.440]   My name is Naveed Kaur.
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:08.240]   I'm a professional golfer.
[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:14.800]   I have started using time blocking after reading your book, Deep Work.
[00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:28.000]   And I just wanted to ask, do I use time blocking only for my work, or can I use it for the
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.600]   other small things throughout the day?
[00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:42.360]   For example, when I'm practicing or training, during that time, I don't have a problem with
[00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:50.040]   focusing on the target hand, but otherwise, like if I'm on the way to the shower, let's
[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:56.200]   say, and I'll just stop, pick up the phone, and start scrolling.
[00:26:56.200 --> 00:27:04.720]   So do I use time blocking to schedule, like I'm going to shower from this time to this
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:14.480]   time that I'm going to like work out from this time to this time?
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:18.960]   I hope that's good.
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:22.360]   - All right.
[00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:23.360]   Naveed Kaur.
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:25.480]   Jesse, we should look him up.
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:26.920]   - I did, yeah.
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:27.920]   - Yeah.
[00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:28.920]   - He's on tour.
[00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:29.920]   - Yeah?
[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:30.920]   - Yeah.
[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:31.920]   - PGA?
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:32.920]   - Yeah.
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:37.560]   - So Jesse knows all of his success, the time blocking?
[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:40.440]   Is that a fair read of the question?
[00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:41.440]   - Probably.
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.680]   - I think we can count that.
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:47.000]   - I mean, what you do talk about does apply to training.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   - Yeah.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:56.120]   Well, I think I'm popular in golf after Mickelson was preaching digital minimalism at the Masters
[00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:57.120]   a few years ago.
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:02.400]   Mickelson was named, he talked about me and Holiday, right?
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:05.320]   He's like, "Newport and Holiday's books have been really useful to me."
[00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:06.560]   And he was having a resurgence then.
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:13.520]   So I think that seeded some of my work among professional golfers.
[00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:15.800]   That's a hard, man, can you imagine a harder sport?
[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:20.560]   Because if you are a professional basketball player or baseball player, like you have to
[00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:23.440]   be, of course, just freakishly athletic.
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:24.600]   And like most people can't get there.
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:29.280]   But if you're at, let's just say, what is the hardest sport once you have normalized
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:33.040]   for you have the right genetics and training that you're playing it, right?
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:37.520]   So not what's the hardest sport to get into, but like the hardest sport once you're there
[00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:38.520]   to perform.
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:47.600]   And if you're doing football and basketball, it's very hard, but it's not like if you lose
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:51.600]   your concentration for five seconds, like the game has been lost.
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:54.000]   You know, like you'd be like, "You know what?
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.240]   I ran a bad route.
[00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:57.960]   I'm a cornerback and I lost a step."
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:28:58.960]   But it's fine.
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:28:59.960]   They didn't even throw it to them.
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:02.080]   Or worst case, like they threw it to them and the secondary had to tackle them and they
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:03.160]   gained some yards.
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:06.640]   But if you're a golfer, that's your game.
[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:10.360]   You lose your concentration, you hit into the water, you're not winning the tournament.
[00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:11.360]   You know?
[00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:13.480]   Or if you're a basketball player, it's like, "I missed a shot."
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:14.480]   It's fine.
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:15.480]   You get 50 more attempts.
[00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:19.400]   Baseball is somewhere in between because now it's like these at-bats, but you can have
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:20.400]   a bad swing.
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:25.040]   But anyways, it just seems like the hardest sport of professional sports to actually do
[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:27.080]   once you're good enough to do it.
[00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:28.520]   It's like the one I would least like to be in.
[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:33.040]   >> Well, one of the things that happens with these guys that are so good is they get so
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:34.120]   many birdies.
[00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:38.960]   So the birdies can make up for a mishap, like a bogey on a certain hole and things.
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:41.680]   >> Like a bogey, but you can, you see these guys melt.
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:42.680]   >> Oh, yeah.
[00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:43.680]   >> Yeah.
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:44.680]   Triple bogey.
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:45.680]   That's right.
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:46.680]   So I mean, I guess they have some leeway.
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:49.600]   You know, my uncle wrote a cool book about this.
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:54.600]   John Paul Newport wrote a book when I was a kid called The Fine Green Line.
[00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:59.600]   So he was a very good golfer, and he made a go at trying to get on the tournament and
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:00.600]   wrote a book about it.
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:05.760]   So he was like doing the, what they call it, Q school or the qualification tournaments.
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:09.200]   Because he was like a really, really good golfer.
[00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:13.840]   And the fine green line that he talks about in that book, it's mental.
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:16.080]   So it's like, yeah, he's a very athletic guy.
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:19.880]   He was a star quarterback at Harvard, you know, like athletic guy.
[00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:27.000]   And he complains, like, I have the physical ability to do the shots that a top golfer
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   has.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.800]   I can, I mean, not like winning the tournament, but like of a PGA player, like I could have
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:35.040]   a PGA caliber round.
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:39.040]   But the biggest, there's a lot of people that that's true of, like very athletic people
[00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:40.040]   who train really hard.
[00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:41.780]   It was the mental.
[00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:43.320]   Because you can't make a mistake.
[00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:47.680]   It's like, I know I can do it, but I have the next four hours, like I can't make a mistake,
[00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:48.680]   you know?
[00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:50.720]   And it was just so then that was what the book was about.
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:51.720]   That's the fine green line.
[00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:55.880]   Who can, who can put up with that mental pressure?
[00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:58.400]   Who can Tiger Woods it and just be like lasers?
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:04.360]   Well, actually, when this episode airs, the Masters will begin and a lot of times you're
[00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:07.880]   going to see the storyline of the people competing.
[00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:13.040]   So that's where you see like, you know, where those errors make extreme, you know, difference
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:14.040]   in the thing.
[00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:18.160]   But in terms of qualifying and earning some money and stuff like that, like getting on
[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:23.360]   tour, like these guys just did so many birdies and sometimes that can make up for the birdies
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:24.360]   can make up for the bogeys.
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:29.280]   But like even the hit the birdies like just consistently and like to read every green.
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:30.920]   And I mean, you see it in the top players.
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:35.840]   They're just, you know, I'm going to destroy this hole and I'm going to destroy you and
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:38.520]   I'm going to make it was like Woods in his prime.
[00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:42.760]   I'm going to make this putt and like from over here, like I just, this is mine.
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:43.760]   I own it.
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:44.760]   This green is mine.
[00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:45.760]   Just like that, that energy.
[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:46.760]   All right.
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:47.760]   But Navid's question.
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:49.720]   So here's the thing.
[00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:51.480]   Professional athletes, Navid, you're a professional athlete.
[00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:52.480]   You're in it.
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:56.200]   You're in an unusual situation because like a lot of what you do is training, which is
[00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:57.520]   structured for you.
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:00.880]   I mean, it's effectively time blocked, but time blocked by your coaching and training
[00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:02.800]   regimes I'm assuming.
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:08.880]   And so in that type of job, really kind of my job is I have this like really prescribed
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:10.240]   training.
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:15.360]   I would say you have to basically invent what I would call a pseudo job.
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:17.800]   And I would divide my life into now three things.
[00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:21.560]   So most people it's like I'm at work or I'm not at work, but for you, it's like I'm training.
[00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:26.280]   I'm in my pseudo job, which is like administrative stuff that needs to get done for your life
[00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:27.280]   to function.
[00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:28.280]   And then I'm in leisure.
[00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:31.280]   And I would differentiate between those three things.
[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:32.840]   Your training is already highly structured.
[00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:36.840]   I assume the pseudo jobs, you're like, technically I'm not training.
[00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:37.840]   I'm not on the course.
[00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:38.840]   I'm not in the gym.
[00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:39.840]   I'm not going to work.
[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:42.960]   I need to pay these bills and get this information to my sponsor and go by the bank.
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:47.880]   Time block that because you don't want to waste too much time on the pseudo job.
[00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:48.920]   Time blocking is great for this.
[00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:50.480]   How do I make the most out of the time I have?
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:55.160]   So yes, time block your pseudo, your pseudo job, and then have a clear distinction between
[00:32:55.160 --> 00:33:00.200]   that time and leisure time and don't time block the leisure time because you have to
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:04.180]   have unblocked time or you're going to burn out.
[00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:07.640]   But if you don't block the administrative kind of work stuff you need to get done for
[00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:09.720]   your life to function, it's going to eat up all your time.
[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:12.200]   And it's going to be a source of distraction.
[00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:15.220]   It's going to maybe even hurt you on the course.
[00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:23.640]   So you need a tri part type definition of your life, training, pseudo job and leisure.
[00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:28.840]   Time block to pseudo be much more flexible in the leisure.
[00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:31.360]   All right, that's cool.
[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:32.360]   Professional athletes.
[00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:34.800]   Who do we got next?
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:40.840]   Okay, next up we have a question about full time studying, but basically that's his job
[00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:44.640]   is studying and he does it eight hours a day and he's got a question about that.
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:51.640]   Hi Tom, I'm a second time software developer intern.
[00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:59.040]   My job now is to basically study full time and I'm working from home so I can decide
[00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:04.960]   how to structure my schedule.
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:11.200]   So my question is, do you think studying is considered a deep work?
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:17.120]   Because I know that the maximum deep work hours per day is around three to four, but
[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:21.020]   now I have to study around eight hours.
[00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:25.880]   So do you think this is deep work and this is possible to do?
[00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:32.960]   And how will you structure full time studying?
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:35.580]   You know, this is the thing that's going around now.
[00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:42.080]   I'm not very internet savvy, but when I talk to people who are more YouTube-y and kind
[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:47.960]   of know what's going on, there's this whole culture meme out there, especially on YouTube
[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:51.960]   of these super studiers that like, look, I'm going to study for 12 hours.
[00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:54.920]   They have like a time lapse camera on them doing it.
[00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:56.080]   And there's a lot of this out there.
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:35:00.720]   I guess it's hustle porn, which again is a whole thing I don't know much about.
[00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:06.680]   But suppose on Instagram and on YouTube, there's a bunch of this like, you got a inspirational,
[00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:10.800]   over the top hustle type affirmations or videos or whatever.
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:11.800]   And this is one of them.
[00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:12.800]   Like I study for 12 hours.
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:13.960]   People are like, my God, that's awesome.
[00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:15.160]   Could you imagine?
[00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:17.800]   And I think that whole thing is nonsense.
[00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:20.620]   You should not be studying eight hours a day.
[00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:24.120]   And you're probably not doing productive work for eight hours a day.
[00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:26.240]   There's nothing that requires that much studying.
[00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:33.920]   I think it's, and I don't mean to be accusatory here, but I think it's often like oddly performative
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:36.640]   and I don't quite understand it.
[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:38.080]   So yes, studying done right is deep work.
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:39.080]   It's cognitively demanding.
[00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:42.580]   Three or four hours in a day is probably a good limit.
[00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:47.400]   What you should do with studying is make sure that you're doing the actions that actually
[00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:48.400]   matter.
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:49.400]   What do you need to learn?
[00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:51.400]   What's the best way to actually learn it?
[00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:54.040]   So you want your energy to go where it actually matters.
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:56.120]   Usually for studying that's active recall.
[00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:59.200]   So you're trying to recall the information from scratch without looking at notes.
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:01.540]   That's what helps stick it in your head.
[00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:05.520]   Be wary of transfer theory, study the actual things you need to know.
[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:08.620]   The specific knowledge you need, not kind of knowledge in general.
[00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:11.400]   So in the specific form you're going to be doing it.
[00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:13.480]   Sample tests are always better than just reading textbooks.
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:15.300]   Like yeah, these types of things matter.
[00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:18.560]   You can read like my book, How to Become a Straight A Student for more details about
[00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:22.480]   study tactics that really matter for multiple different types of courses.
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:26.440]   You can look at the first two years of my blog at calnewport.com.
[00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:30.440]   The first two years I really focused on advanced study tactics.
[00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:33.800]   So there's a lot you can do, but you should be doing two, three, maybe four hours in two
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:34.800]   sessions.
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:35.800]   That's it.
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:37.000]   And then do other stuff with the rest of your time.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.440]   I mean, I really think when you see a lot of this, I study eight hours a day, I study
[00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:41.980]   10 hours a day.
[00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:42.980]   Part of it's performative.
[00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:45.160]   Part of it is guilt.
[00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:50.720]   Like I'm somehow not properly putting in the effort to live up to my potential.
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:53.660]   If I'm not just doing this all day, this should be like a normal job.
[00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:56.160]   But I'm saying put that aside.
[00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:58.300]   You're not going to effectively study that long.
[00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:02.520]   Use good techniques, a reasonable amount of time each day, and then use the rest of your
[00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:06.800]   time for something else that's important, that's meaningful, that's values driven.
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:10.080]   Don't be one of those hustle porn guys on YouTube that's like, look, I'm an hour 12
[00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:12.480]   of studying and everyone's like, wow, how do you do it?
[00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:13.480]   That's not impressive.
[00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:14.480]   It's weird.
[00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:15.480]   It's a David Blaine stunt.
[00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:16.840]   That's not the right way to learn things.
[00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:18.440]   All right.
[00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:25.000]   So hopefully that's a relief for this person asking the question and not like an accusation,
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.080]   but I've seen these things.
[00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:27.080]   It's a whole thing.
[00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:31.600]   Like it's time-lapse videos of people just studying like ridiculous hours.
[00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:34.360]   And I guess it's supposed to be impressive or something like that.
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:36.000]   But the video is getting a lot of views.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.920]   Yeah, maybe we should do it.
[00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:40.360]   Yeah, we should do.
[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:42.440]   I would be, I can't see, look, I'm lazy.
[00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:45.880]   That's why I do all this like focus and be organized because I can't just like grind
[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:46.880]   it out or whatever.
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:49.440]   So it'd be a pretty, pretty boring video.
[00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:50.440]   Well, you have 17 jobs.
[00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:52.760]   I don't think you're lazy, but you just have a lot of those things.
[00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:54.560]   I just, I'm not a good grinder.
[00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:55.560]   Yeah.
[00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:56.560]   All right.
[00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:58.720]   What do we got here?
[00:37:58.720 --> 00:37:59.720]   Next question.
[00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:01.920]   The next question is about embracing boredom.
[00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:04.080]   Howdy, Cal.
[00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:06.120]   Erica here.
[00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:15.200]   I've been listening to some of your older episodes again, and you would talk about boredom
[00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:16.480]   at times.
[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:20.280]   I'm curious how you are bored.
[00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:24.280]   You read a phone book, watch clouds in the sky.
[00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:25.400]   I'm kidding.
[00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:33.920]   But I am curious about what you do to be bored so that way you can embrace the boredom as
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:41.600]   opposed to feel like you want to climb up walls and escape.
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:42.600]   Love your work.
[00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:43.600]   Thanks a lot.
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:44.600]   Take care.
[00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:45.600]   Bye.
[00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:49.200]   I'm curious about this, but have you heard of these podcasts, Jesse, where it's people
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:50.640]   reading the phone book?
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:51.640]   No.
[00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:52.640]   They're popular.
[00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:53.640]   They're popular.
[00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:58.640]   So my wife and I were listening to an NPR thing that was talking about these podcasts.
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:38:59.640]   Like this is a real thing.
[00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:01.160]   You could probably find one if you search.
[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:06.800]   Like it'll read from a phone book for like a couple hours.
[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:09.600]   And with like a nice voice, a good mic.
[00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:15.400]   And NPR was trying to argue this long, complicated argument about like overstimulation and blah,
[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:16.400]   blah, blah.
[00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:19.800]   And no, it's people trying to fall asleep.
[00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:25.080]   So some people like to hear just a voice just kind of reading.
[00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:29.680]   There's no actual, the content triggers nothing in your brain, but you're just kind of like
[00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:30.680]   hearing it.
[00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:31.680]   And for some people find it relaxing.
[00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:32.920]   So there's like a lot of these podcasts.
[00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:36.840]   I mean, some of it might be ASMR too, but there's a lot of these podcasts and it's really just
[00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:37.840]   people reading.
[00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:41.040]   Which, by the way, would be much easier for us to produce.
[00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:43.040]   All this nonsense.
[00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:46.440]   I mean, I'd still have you in the studio.
[00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:47.440]   So we would just cut to you.
[00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:49.480]   I would just be reading names.
[00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:51.880]   Like I could still make my 200K a month.
[00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:52.880]   Exactly.
[00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:59.440]   I'd be like Erica, Alex, Donald, Jesse.
[00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:00.440]   What do you think?
[00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:03.440]   You'd be like, good names, good names.
[00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:06.240]   Then I would just go back and keep reading names.
[00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:08.240]   It'd be easier.
[00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:11.260]   But what was the question?
[00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:12.260]   How do I embrace boredom?
[00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:13.260]   Okay.
[00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:15.400]   So here's the thing about boredom.
[00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:19.220]   I'm not a boredom booster.
[00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:25.080]   So I argue in deep work embrace boredom, but I don't argue like, let's go seek out staring
[00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:28.600]   at the wall and that like we're going to get inside or whatever.
[00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:33.040]   As Erica was hinting at here, the reason why I think you should become comfortable and
[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:38.400]   familiar with boredom is that otherwise your mind is going to demand stimuli.
[00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:43.560]   When you're doing something like deep work, which is devoid of a lot of diverse stimuli,
[00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:46.660]   just doing the same thing, it'll be comfortable with it.
[00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:50.240]   And if you're not, if you always look at your phone when you're bored, your mind won't tolerate
[00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:52.760]   the lack of stimuli and doing something like deep work.
[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:53.760]   But here's the thing.
[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:57.620]   My answer is hidden in like my solution is hidden in that answer.
[00:40:57.620 --> 00:41:00.600]   Like the reason why I say embrace boredom is so that when you're doing deep work, which
[00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:04.720]   is boring, you won't feel that urge to look at something else.
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:10.320]   So that means the type of quote unquote boredom I seek is actually just doing monofocus things
[00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:15.240]   that can be of value and have interest, but just aren't super stimuli that don't have
[00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:16.240]   a lot of stimuli.
[00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:17.240]   Right.
[00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:19.840]   So just reading for a long time, it can be really interesting, but then there's also
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:22.040]   parts of your mind's like, can we look at something else?
[00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:23.800]   Can we look at our phone?
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:27.320]   And you're like, you don't, you know, so reading can do it.
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:29.560]   Walking is another big one for me.
[00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:32.360]   Don't put on the headphones when I do the walk.
[00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:34.520]   Now I'm not, again, I'm not trying to induce boredom.
[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:35.520]   I'm not meditating.
[00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:37.320]   I'm not staring at the sidewalk.
[00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:38.600]   I'm thinking about things.
[00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:44.920]   I'm reflecting, I'm trying to have ideas, but I'm avoiding the really highly super palatable
[00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:47.000]   digital distractions.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.580]   Going into a store, you know, just going to the store and see what's going on.
[00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:59.340]   So for me, this is how I'm defining boredom is absence of highly palatable digital distraction.
[00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:02.560]   So it doesn't mean you have to be doing nothing.
[00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:06.040]   To me, it just means you have to be doing something that you could have done 25 years
[00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:07.040]   ago.
[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:12.360]   It's like you're trying to simulate whatever, 1995, or I'm not reading from the phone book,
[00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:17.080]   but I can't look at my phone while I'm waiting in line, you know, or I'm on a walk.
[00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:18.720]   I don't want my walk, man.
[00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:21.680]   And so that's what I'd recommend for everyone is that on a regular basis, you want to do
[00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:26.280]   things where you've not, you have no highly stimulating digital distractions, even though
[00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:28.200]   you feel the urge for them.
[00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:30.840]   Like, can't I just take this out?
[00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:33.760]   Even watching TV can accomplish this.
[00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:39.320]   I'm watching TV and my instinct is, can I look at my phone at the same time?
[00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:42.580]   I'm not getting enough stimuli and you don't.
[00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:44.600]   So you know, again, I'm not staring at clouds.
[00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:45.600]   I'm not reading a phone book.
[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:47.480]   I'm watching TV.
[00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:52.520]   But by removing highly palatable digital distractions from many different points of your life, you
[00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:57.180]   get used to being in situations where you don't have access to those highly palatable
[00:42:57.180 --> 00:42:58.180]   digital distractions.
[00:42:58.180 --> 00:42:59.400]   So maybe I need a different word.
[00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:05.760]   Instead of boredom, it's like stimuli freedom or 1995 mode.
[00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:09.440]   It's getting away from that and being okay with getting away from that, where that is
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:12.120]   for listeners, me holding up a fake phone.
[00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:13.920]   That is the key.
[00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:14.920]   All right.
[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:22.240]   Let me talk for a second here about the key to understanding books, which is our sponsor
[00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:23.240]   Blinkist.
[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:28.680]   So Blinkist is a longtime friend of the show.
[00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:33.840]   It's a subscription service in which you get access to 10 to 15 minute summaries of thousands
[00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:35.560]   of bestselling nonfiction books.
[00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:40.200]   You can read the summaries or you can listen to them.
[00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:45.640]   It is the best way to quickly assess a book and say, what's this about?
[00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:46.640]   What are the ideas?
[00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:51.000]   Do I need to actually buy and read this or do I have enough to kind of know how this
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.360]   fits into the cultural conversation?
[00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:55.640]   Blinkist is the tool to do it.
[00:43:55.640 --> 00:44:01.840]   It's my sort of right hand man, my extra secret power for quickly navigating the world of
[00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:04.720]   books and figuring out what I read and what I don't need to read, making sure that I'm
[00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:10.400]   up on the cultural conversation without having to try to read 50 books just to know everything
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:12.200]   that's happening.
[00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:21.880]   So if you are a reader and you should be, Blinkist needs to be in your bag of tools.
[00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:25.800]   So right now Blinkist has a special offer just for our audience.

[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:51.800]   I also want to talk about Athletic Greens.
[00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:53.920]   So we worry like, are we getting the right nutrients?
[00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:55.800]   Do I have the right minerals?
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:57.960]   Am I getting enough vitamin, whatever, right?
[00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:02.120]   I mean, these are things we worry about, especially as we get older.
[00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:04.640]   I worry about this a little bit, but I'm still in my thirties.
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:05.800]   Jesse is in his forties.
[00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:10.600]   So this is all he thinks about because his body is falling apart on him.
[00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:13.200]   How are you going to get the right things you need?
[00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:16.480]   Well, as I've always said, you have two choices and only two choices.
[00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:21.200]   Number one, you can go into a GNC and get lost among all of those shelves of all this
[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:28.120]   random stuff where you have a 50% chance that a roided up bodybuilder will beat you mercilessly
[00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:29.360]   for walking into the store.
[00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:33.200]   That happens 50% of the time, or you can do Athletic Greens.
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:34.600]   You have to choose.
[00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:36.640]   Let me tell you why I think you should choose Athletic Greens.
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:44.440]   In addition to you not getting beaten mercilessly by a steroided bodybuilder, it is the top,
[00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:49.520]   in my opinion, the top supplement source on the market, because what they do is say, we
[00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:54.880]   will figure out for you what you need, but also where the very best sources of these
[00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:56.240]   different things are.
[00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:58.960]   We will put it together in just one product, this powder.
[00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:01.180]   It's all we do is this powder.
[00:46:01.180 --> 00:46:02.960]   We're always improving it.
[00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:03.960]   They have different versions.
[00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:05.240]   They upgrade it every year.
[00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:06.480]   Can we get a better mineral?
[00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:07.960]   Can we get a better adaptogen?
[00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:12.720]   And all you have to worry about as the consumer is one scoop once a day, put it in water in
[00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:14.520]   the morning, drink it, you're done.
[00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:16.920]   They obsess about getting the right ingredients in here.
[00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:20.680]   They obsess about getting the right form that's going to be the most effective so that you
[00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:22.340]   don't have to.
[00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:24.000]   You don't have to go to the GNC.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.200]   You don't have to get punched by a bodybuilder.
[00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:31.000]   You just take the Athletic Greens powder every morning and you can trust it's done.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:32.840]   So I take Athletic Greens.
[00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:34.400]   Jesse will attest to this.
[00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:35.880]   I have told him about it.
[00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:37.840]   I have sold him on it.
[00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:42.000]   I take it each morning so I don't have to worry about anything else.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:45.080]   And I recommend you do too.
[00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:48.200]   So right now it's time to reclaim your health and arm your immune system with convenient
[00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:52.640]   daily nutrition, especially now that we're in flu and cold season.
[00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:54.840]   It's just one scoop and a cup of water every day.
[00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:55.840]   That's it.
[00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:58.960]   No need for a million different pills and supplements to look out for your health.
[00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:03.640]   To make it easy, Athletic Greens is going to give you free a one year supply of immune
[00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:08.200]   supporting vitamin D and five free travel packs with your first purchase.
[00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:10.240]   All you have to do is visit athleticgreens.com/deep.
[00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:17.720]   Again, that is athleticgreens.com/deep to take ownership over your health.
[00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:20.800]   All right, Jesse, I think we have time.
[00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:23.920]   All right, we have time for one more.
[00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:32.120]   So the viewing audience doesn't know is I'm running a big search committee meeting imminently.
[00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:35.920]   And so we're sort of podcasting under the wire here.
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:39.400]   One of my 17 jobs is running the faculty search committee.
[00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:46.480]   So we've got to switch from Athletic Greens to a question to faculty recruiting.
[00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:47.760]   This is why I have two cups of coffee.
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:48.980]   So let's fit in one more, Jesse.
[00:47:48.980 --> 00:47:49.980]   We can fit in one more.
[00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:50.980]   All right, sounds good.
[00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:52.520]   This is a fitting one.
[00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:55.600]   We got a question about deep work in YouTube.
[00:47:55.600 --> 00:48:02.160]   Hi, I'm Daniel, a high school student from Toronto.
[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:06.880]   My question for you was, how do I ensure I'm doing deep work when I need to be connected
[00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:09.440]   to a distracting source like the internet?
[00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:14.320]   I'm trying to learn web development, so HTML, CSS, and soon JavaScript.
[00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:18.400]   And the best way I found to do so, and from talking to other people, the best way to do
[00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:23.800]   so is through YouTube and the internet, which is also an incredibly distracting source that
[00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:25.800]   you've mentioned as a killer of deep work.
[00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:30.520]   So I'd love to hear your thoughts on how I can reconcile those two things.
[00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:31.520]   Thanks.
[00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:38.360]   Well, Daniel, first of all, don't trust anyone who puts content on YouTube.
[00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:39.640]   Because I can't.
[00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:40.640]   Someone who...
[00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:41.760]   It's all garbage.
[00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:46.400]   And anything that's on YouTube, I would not trust if I was you.
[00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:49.160]   Hold on, Jesse's handing me a memo here.
[00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:50.160]   We're on YouTube.
[00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:51.160]   Uh-oh.
[00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:52.160]   No.
[00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:53.160]   But you know what, Jesse?
[00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:54.940]   But we're not very popular on YouTube.
[00:48:54.940 --> 00:48:59.280]   So I think that means that we are not being distracting.
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:02.280]   So we can...
[00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:03.840]   Keep the YouTube channel alive.
[00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:05.840]   Yeah, keep the YouTube channel alive.
[00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:06.840]   Yeah.
[00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:09.280]   No, Daniel, you need to watch our channel.
[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:13.320]   And you need to ring that bell and smash the subscribe button.
[00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:18.240]   And once we start giving away briefcases full of money to our guests to try to get people
[00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:19.240]   to watch YouTube...
[00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:20.240]   Oh, man.
[00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:22.480]   Okay, Daniel, it's a good question.
[00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:27.720]   So I hear this a lot, this general point a lot, especially from high school students,
[00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:30.640]   which is like, "I have to use...
[00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:35.220]   There's something I need from the internet that's part of this bigger work I'm doing.
[00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:38.120]   How could I possibly not just be endlessly distracted on the internet?"
[00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:41.280]   And I think you can separate the two things.
[00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:43.000]   You can separate the two things.
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:48.160]   So you're learning how to code.
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:50.000]   And you're getting information from the internet.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   Makes sense.
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:52.560]   A lot of good information on there.
[00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:56.260]   You can Google commands that you don't understand.
[00:49:56.260 --> 00:49:57.960]   You can watch a YouTube tutorial.
[00:49:57.960 --> 00:50:03.920]   And you're saying the problem is when you look for those other things on the internet,
[00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:06.720]   you also end up doing other types of distracting things.
[00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:12.400]   You go to look up a YouTube video about CSS, and you see like recommended a Cal Newport
[00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:15.920]   video where I'm giving briefcases of money to professional golfers.
[00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:16.920]   And there you go.
[00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:20.080]   You have to click on that, and then you have to watch that.
[00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:25.440]   My advice is don't click on the other things.
[00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:31.660]   I think there's this helplessness a little bit of like if I'm on the internet and I see
[00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:34.460]   things that are appealing, like I have to click on it.
[00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:37.000]   And I don't think we're so helpless.
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:41.080]   I mean, at least if we're talking about very specific context, you're like, "This is a
[00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:42.240]   specific thing I'm doing.
[00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:48.040]   I'm trying to learn how to code, and I'm spending the next hour working on it."
[00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:54.740]   Just say, "I'm not going to look at non-coding related things, even if I see a link."
[00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:57.740]   So I know in general, it's very difficult if I say, "I'm just going to try not to use
[00:50:57.740 --> 00:50:58.740]   the internet."
[00:50:58.740 --> 00:51:01.080]   Like, come on, you have all these different times in your life, you're bored, you're watching
[00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:02.080]   TV.
[00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:03.500]   Fine, that's very difficult.
[00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:08.880]   But in the specific context of I am doing this activity, I don't think that's a hard
[00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:12.680]   rule to follow because it's very clear and it makes sense.
[00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:14.320]   Like I'm trying to learn something right now.
[00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:17.760]   I'm not going to go on the internet, right?
[00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:22.880]   Like I think just being clear and tough lovey about that might be all you need.
[00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:26.560]   If you're serious about learning how to code, don't click video recommendations.
[00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:33.360]   And yeah, you can do plugins and do a distraction-free tube plugin that gets rid of the recommendations
[00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:34.760]   when you're on YouTube.
[00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:38.420]   I can tell you, treat YouTube like a library, not a television channel.
[00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:40.740]   So you search for the specific things you need.
[00:51:40.740 --> 00:51:44.600]   You don't surf serendipitously to see what's interesting.
[00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:45.720]   I could tell you all those rules.
[00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:50.000]   I could talk about putting on blockers on your internet that you can configure so you
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:51.580]   can't go to other types of things.
[00:51:51.580 --> 00:51:54.440]   But I think it's just simpler to say when you're programming, don't click on anything
[00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:55.440]   else.
[00:51:55.440 --> 00:52:00.440]   You know, have a little...and that act of individual discipline, I think is actually
[00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:01.440]   going to empower you.
[00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:03.400]   Because you're like, you know what?
[00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:05.680]   I don't have to click on this nonsense when I don't want to.
[00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:09.000]   And I'm learning something because it's important to me and I see these links and I don't click
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   on it.
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:11.000]   I have power over that.
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:17.320]   I mean, I think feeling that power, feeling that efficacy, I'm in charge of what I look
[00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:18.960]   at.
[00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:20.720]   This algorithm doesn't run me.
[00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:22.220]   These links don't run me.
[00:52:22.220 --> 00:52:24.380]   I'm constructing my world.
[00:52:24.380 --> 00:52:26.420]   Is a very important thing to have.
[00:52:26.420 --> 00:52:29.220]   And this might be a place as a high school student, so you're new to this, to say, yeah,
[00:52:29.220 --> 00:52:31.600]   I might be a teenager.
[00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:34.200]   You know, I'm not an old man like Jesse.
[00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:40.340]   I'm much closer to like a young in his 30s type personality like Cal.
[00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:42.180]   But so you're a young man.
[00:52:42.180 --> 00:52:44.300]   This is the time to say, I'm an adult.
[00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:45.540]   I'm about to become an adult.
[00:52:45.540 --> 00:52:47.180]   I can use the internet without losing control.
[00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:50.360]   And I know a lot of adults can't do that, but I think you can, Daniel.
[00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:52.300]   So that's my tough love thing.
[00:52:52.300 --> 00:52:53.300]   Just don't click.
[00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:54.560]   Just don't do it.
[00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:55.560]   See the recommendations.
[00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:56.560]   Don't click.
[00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:57.560]   It's a simple rule.
[00:52:57.560 --> 00:53:00.100]   I'm not saying your whole life, but when you're doing programming, just do programming, block
[00:53:00.100 --> 00:53:02.500]   off that time, look up what you need to look up.
[00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:03.500]   Don't follow links.
[00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:05.880]   You're going to come out on the other side of that invigorated like, oh, I guess I am
[00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:06.880]   kind of in control of this.
[00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:10.340]   And that could snowball to more and more feeling of efficacy, more and more discipline with
[00:53:10.340 --> 00:53:11.340]   digital distraction.
[00:53:11.340 --> 00:53:15.900]   So it actually could be the entry point, the entry point to a much better relationship to
[00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:17.980]   these technologies.
[00:53:17.980 --> 00:53:19.860]   So we'll skip all of the plugins.
[00:53:19.860 --> 00:53:21.300]   We'll skip all of the blockers.
[00:53:21.300 --> 00:53:27.580]   We'll skip all of the rhetoric and just say, don't buy into that narrative of helplessness
[00:53:27.580 --> 00:53:33.500]   that you have to follow distractions because you're young and young people are out of control
[00:53:33.500 --> 00:53:38.220]   on the internet and they can't help themselves and they live on YouTube.
[00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:39.460]   You can do what you want to do.
[00:53:39.460 --> 00:53:40.900]   And I think what you're doing is cool.
[00:53:40.900 --> 00:53:48.500]   Learn hard school, learn hard skills, build cool things, connect to people who are interesting,
[00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:49.660]   expose yourself to ideas.
[00:53:49.660 --> 00:53:53.620]   You know, all the interesting stuff to make a good life, go to your age, do those things.
[00:53:53.620 --> 00:53:58.700]   And you can, you can leave the going down YouTube rabbit holes for a time when you have
[00:53:58.700 --> 00:54:00.580]   nothing else to do.
[00:54:00.580 --> 00:54:01.980]   All right.
[00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:04.180]   Well, I think that's all the time we have.
[00:54:04.180 --> 00:54:05.180]   I have to go run a meeting.
[00:54:05.180 --> 00:54:10.300]   Thank you everyone who sent in their listener calls.
[00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:13.540]   If you like what you heard, you'll like what you see on our YouTube channel.
[00:54:13.540 --> 00:54:16.520]   I feel weird saying that after just telling Daniel not to click on YouTube links.
[00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:22.540]   So if you go to our YouTube channel at youtube.com/CalNewportMedia, ignore the recommendations, treat it like a library.
[00:54:22.540 --> 00:54:27.460]   Go there just because you're, you specifically are coming to listen to some Cal, not because
[00:54:27.460 --> 00:54:29.640]   you are web surfing.
[00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:32.340]   If you like what you heard, you'll also like what you read at my newsletter, sign up at
[00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:33.340]   calnewport.com.
[00:54:33.340 --> 00:54:38.180]   We'll be back next week on Monday with our next episode of the Deep Questions podcast.
[00:54:38.180 --> 00:54:40.420]   And until then, as always, stay deep.
[00:54:40.420 --> 00:54:47.740]   [MUSIC]
