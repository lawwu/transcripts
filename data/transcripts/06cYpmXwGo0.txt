[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400]   Any quick tips on the, I know where I want to go.
[00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.120]   I'm being intentional.
[00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.160]   I've got to book the flights that maybe we haven't covered before.
[00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.040]   Make sure that the flights you've booked, you have added to your calendar
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.120]   to add it to an itinerary and that you're monitoring them, monitoring
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.580]   for things like seat changes, or sometimes there's a connection where
[00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.480]   maybe they'll have in your connecting flight, they'll change the flight
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.560]   times and now you have too short or too long of a connection or schedule
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.520]   change of any other sort, keep monitoring them.
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.360]   And what you can do is sign up for alerts from the airline to make sure
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.080]   that they notify you for every change that happens to your flight, but also
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.380]   you can use monitoring tools that are out there, TripIt has some of them.
[00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.160]   Other tools have these automatic monitoring to make sure that you're
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.680]   getting the right flights and that changes don't occur in terms of how
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.100]   else to book, I would always keep an eye on optimizing your flights to see if
[00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.800]   maybe the price you've paid does drop with points and miles in particular.
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.100]   You can usually get a rebate back of whatever the flight differences,
[00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.480]   huge chunk of miles back.
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.200]   So you do want to keep searching or keep monitoring automatically
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.920]   with tools to see if there's an advantage to take there.
