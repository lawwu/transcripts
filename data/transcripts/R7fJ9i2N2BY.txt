[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120]   Spend time with the right people in the right way.
[00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.000]   And as we discussed last week in the annual review episode,
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.040]   we talked about people that are boat anchors in your life
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:08.880]   and bring you down,
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.660]   and it just really highlights how important it is
[00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.220]   to spend time with the right people.
[00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.200]   Time is such a limited resource.
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.900]   Sahil had this great blog post
[00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.300]   where he showed all these charts
[00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.400]   about how we spend time and how that changes.
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.360]   And if you look at the time you spend with family,
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.280]   by the time you hit your mid-20s, that's kind of gone.
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.120]   If you look at time you spend with friends,
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.160]   surprisingly, it also diminishes usually as you have kids.
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.880]   Time with your partner is actually relatively consistent,
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.360]   but your time with children chart
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.720]   was the really interesting one,
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.160]   where it peaks for most people in their mid to late 30s,
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.580]   and then it kind of falls off a cliff.
[00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.280]   And the amount of time you spend with your kids
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.960]   really goes down, which makes sense.
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.360]   You know, we probably can all imagine
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.200]   how much less time we spent with our parents
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.000]   as we went to college, as we moved out on our own.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.800]   So the summary is to be mindful
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.480]   of who you spend your time with this year
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.000]   and prioritize relationships that energize you
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.200]   and distance yourself from negativity.
