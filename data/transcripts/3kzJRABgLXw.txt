[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.660]   Pastor John, what is the purpose behind fasting? Richard Foster wrote a book on
[00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:20.120]   spiritual disciplines, and in it he says that probably the most important text in
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:29.760]   all the Bible for establishing the importance of Christian fasting--Christian
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:37.600]   fasting--that we should do it today is Matthew 9, 14 and following. Let me read
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.920]   just a couple of verses of that and show you the sentence that I think he's right
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:50.200]   about. The disciples of John, John the Baptist, came to Jesus and said, "Why do
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:59.040]   the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?" So he's not fasting. And Jesus
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:06.440]   said to them, "Can the wedding guests mourn as long as the bridegroom is with
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:15.200]   them? The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away, and then they
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:24.920]   will fast." Now that's the sentence that Foster says, and I think he's right, shows that
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:31.760]   in Jesus' mind, when he is taken away--that is, when he dies and ascends to the
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:40.480]   Father--there will be fasting. And therefore the context of fasting in
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:49.320]   Jesus' mind is longing for the "not yet" of the kingdom. So he's come, and while he
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.240]   was here, they didn't fast because the bridegroom was present. But when the
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.720]   bridegroom is taken away to come a second time, there's this "ache" in the
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.080]   heart of God's people. And I think that's the general statement about the meaning
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:11.920]   of fasting. Fasting is a physical exclamation point at the end of the
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:20.040]   sentence, "I need you. I want you. I long for you. You are my treasure. I want more
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:26.280]   of you, and oh for the day when you would return. Maranatha! Come, Lord Jesus!" And
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:34.200]   fasting is an exclamation point at the end of all those sentences. So the heart
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:43.080]   of it is longing, and a putting of our stomach where our heart is, in order to
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:51.960]   give added intensity and expressiveness to our ache for Jesus, and our longing or
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:58.680]   our ache for all the implications of Jesus' power in the present moment that
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.480]   isn't completely realized. We want to see people healed, we want to see people
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.560]   saved, we want to see marriages redeemed, and we ache and long for this to happen,
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:15.400]   and therefore we ask Jesus to come by putting this exclamation point of
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:23.160]   longing at the end of our our desires. Here's one more thing, and I say this
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.880]   largely from experience, and people can test whether they think it's got
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:33.960]   biblical root or not, I think it does. I think fasting is not only a positive
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:39.760]   statement of "this much I want you, you're more important to me than food," but it's
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:46.400]   also a negative way of exposing latent idolatries. When I'm not being
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:56.160]   medicated by food, what comes out of my heart? Anger? Lust? The need for television
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.300]   and more and more of it, or something like that? People need to know what's at
[00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:08.640]   the bottom. I think Job was a good man, basically, but at the bottom of Job's
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:18.200]   life was some latent sin, and when God took away from him health, took away from
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.760]   him children, in other words, this was a horrible enforced fast from children and
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:30.040]   from health, Job got bent out of shape and said some things for which he had to
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:39.520]   later repent. And I find, Tony, that if I go without, say, 24 hours of food from
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.680]   from supper to supper or breakfast to breakfast or something like that, my, oh my,
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:53.560]   what is exposed of my heart towards my wife and my daughter? So it is a very
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:05:00.520]   good discipline, not only as a positive expression of longing in prayer, but also
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:06.560]   a negative exposure of my heart so that I can deal with these things as they come up.
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.360]   Thank you, Pastor John, and for more on fasting, see John Piper's book "A Hunger
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.680]   for God," which you can download for free online at DesiringGod.org. I'm your host,
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.600]   Tony Reinke, thanks for listening.
