[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.920]   - Welcome back as we begin a new week
[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.220]   on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.980]   Thanks for making us a part of your daily routine.
[00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.720]   Kelly writes in to ask about spiritual leadership
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:16.560]   in the home.
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.760]   She writes this, "Hello Pastor John,
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.020]   "my husband and I are still in the beginning stages
[00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:20.860]   "of our marriage.
[00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.720]   "Both of us were raised in a Christian home.
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.800]   "Unfortunately, both of us had fathers
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.780]   "who failed to lead the family spiritually.
[00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.980]   "Our mothers did that job."
[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.880]   Now I desire my husband to lead our home spiritually,
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.080]   but we both don't know what that looks like.
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.440]   Does he lead in prayer with me daily?
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.780]   Does he read the word with me daily?
[00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.080]   What did this look like for you, Pastor John?
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.740]   - Well, my first thought is,
[00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.640]   I wonder why Kelly wrote to us instead of her husband.
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.920]   I hope it's because they agreed,
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.000]   they both wanted to ask and they agreed
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.640]   it was just simpler for her to write in, that's fine.
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.340]   I hope it's not because he's dragging his feet
[00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.320]   and she's having to pull him along.
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.600]   So my first suggestion is that she go get her husband
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.000]   right now, turn this off, go get him
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.980]   and listen to this together,
[00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.080]   rather than her becoming the mediator here
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.020]   and turning it into something he may not like.
[00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.700]   Let's put one passage of scripture at least in front of us
[00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.300]   so that the assumption isn't taken for granted.
[00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.740]   Ephesians 5, 21, "Submit to one another,"
[00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.600]   husbands and wives, "out of reverence for Christ.
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.360]   "Wives, submit to your own husbands as to the Lord,
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.480]   "for the husband is the head of the wife
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.600]   "as Christ is the head of the church,
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.140]   "his body and is himself its savior.
[00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.760]   "Now as the church submits to Christ,
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.440]   "so also wives should submit in everything
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.840]   "to their husbands."
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.540]   Husbands, love your wives,
[00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.540]   "as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her."
[00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:14.940]   So the picture we have is that in loving each other
[00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.600]   and serving each other and submitting to each other's needs
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.600]   and longings in a kind of loving and humble mutuality,
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.680]   the wife takes her cues from the church
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.420]   as the church is called to follow Christ as its leader.
[00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.240]   And the husband takes his cues from Christ
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.320]   as the head of the church who gave himself up for her.
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.280]   One of the reasons this whole issue
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.760]   of headship and submission in marriage matters
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.440]   is that God intended for marriage
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.200]   to represent the covenant love
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.960]   between Christ and his bride, the church.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.780]   That's what we are trying to flesh out
[00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.440]   when we're working on this matter of headship and submission.
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.440]   There are differences and there are similarities
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.080]   between the relationship between the wife and the husband
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.520]   on the one hand and the relationship between Christ
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.960]   and the church on the other, and both the similarities
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.120]   and the differences shape the way we flesh out this drama
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.640]   of Christ and the church.
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.640]   For example, one similarity is that Christ
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:33.240]   wants the submission of the church to be free and joyful
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.640]   with a full understanding of who he is
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.880]   and what he stands for and why he's doing what he's doing.
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.720]   Christ does not want slavish obedience
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.200]   or joyless compliance or mindless submissiveness
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.840]   from the church.
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.240]   He wants his church to be full of intelligence
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.400]   and understanding and wisdom and joy and freedom
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.160]   when she follows him.
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.880]   Without this, her following, the church's following,
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.700]   would not glorify the Lord Jesus.
[00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.440]   Mindless submission does not glorify a leader.
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.000]   Similarly, a good husband does not want slavish obedience
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.680]   or joyless compliance or mindless submissiveness.
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.160]   He wants his wife to be full, full of intelligence
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.080]   and understanding and wisdom and joy and freedom
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.600]   when she commits herself to follow him.
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.160]   So that's an example of similarity affecting how we do it.
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.960]   Here's an example of difference between a husband
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.040]   and a wife on the one hand and Christ and the church
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:40.040]   on the other hand that affects how the marriage works.
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:45.740]   Husbands, human husbands are fallible and sinful
[00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.440]   and Christ is not.
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.860]   Therefore, you can never draw a straight line
[00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.420]   from the way Christ leads his church
[00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.440]   to the way the husband leads his wife
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.560]   without taking into account this distinction,
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.120]   this difference, his finiteness and his sin
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.160]   have to come into the picture.
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.200]   Another difference that makes a difference,
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.960]   another difference that shapes how we go about this
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.960]   is that both the husband and the wife
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:23.420]   are submitted to the Lord Jesus as their supreme Lord
[00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:29.440]   and Jesus is her direct Lord, not her indirect Lord,
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.980]   only through the husband.
[00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:32.420]   The teaching of the New Testament,
[00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:36.560]   and you can see this in 1 Peter 2, Ephesians 5,
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.700]   Colossians 3, is that Christians, male and female,
[00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:44.720]   first relate to the Lord Jesus as their supreme master
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.800]   and then for the Lord's sake, as it says,
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.320]   in obedience to the Lord, we enter back in.
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.820]   We are sent back in to the institutions of the world,
[00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:00.200]   like marriage, in relationships that God assigns to us
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:04.640]   and we act then in those relationships of submission freely
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:09.640]   because our supreme and primary Lord has said to.
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.220]   So the submission, therefore,
[00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:12.880]   that a woman offers to her husband
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:17.640]   is done so freely at the bidding of her Lord, Jesus.
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:23.100]   So those two differences between our marriages
[00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.600]   and Christ's marriage imply
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.040]   that the husband will not presume
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.760]   that his will is infallible
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:35.840]   and that his wife is less wise or intelligent
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.520]   or insightful than he is.
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.120]   Jesus is always wiser than the church.
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:44.720]   Husbands are not always wiser than their wives.
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.000]   It also means, those differences mean,
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.880]   that a mature Christian husband
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:55.780]   will not express his leadership with childish,
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.040]   proud bullying or one-sided decision-making,
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:05.040]   but will always seek out both the wisdom
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:10.840]   and the desires of his wife.
[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:14.160]   This is what good, fallen, fallible,
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.800]   yet Christlike leadership does.
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.980]   Another way to talk about this same reality
[00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:25.260]   is to point out that the roles of leadership and submission
[00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.780]   in the marriage are not based on competence.
[00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:32.860]   God never said that the man is appointed to be head
[00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.320]   because he's more competent
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:38.060]   or that the woman is appointed to submission
[00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:40.800]   because she's less competent.
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:45.800]   Competence is not the issue in whether a man is head
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.680]   and a woman is submitting.
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:53.480]   Competence plays a role in how they exercise the roles
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.420]   of leadership and submission,
[00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:58.760]   but not who the roles belong to.
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:03.760]   So the way I define a husband's leadership or headship,
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:08.860]   as God wills it, is a sense of benevolent responsibility
[00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:13.640]   to lead, to protect, and to provide for his wife.
[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:15.180]   And the key word there
[00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:17.860]   is a sense of benevolent responsibility.
[00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:21.800]   He may have a disability, for example,
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:25.320]   that keeps him from being the breadwinner,
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:28.180]   but that disability does not keep him
[00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.940]   from feeling a benevolent responsibility
[00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:33.460]   that the family's needs are met
[00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:36.040]   and that sense of responsibility will move him
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:39.260]   to take initiatives with his wife and children
[00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.260]   to see to it that the family is cared for.
[00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.500]   That's the main issue, a sense of responsibility
[00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:49.940]   that moves the man to take initiatives in the family
[00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:53.680]   so that God's will is done as much as possible
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.600]   by every member of the family.
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.100]   So here's some examples.
[00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:01.520]   And keep in mind that when I say
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.520]   he feels a special responsibility
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.960]   for initiatives in the family,
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:09.520]   he's not ruling out the fact
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:12.000]   that his wife may have important initiatives
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   to bring to the discussion because of his blind spots
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   and his fallibility and her wisdom and her perceptivity.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:27.760]   So the point is she ought not to have to feel
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:32.680]   that she's constantly doing the initiating, prodding,
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.480]   to get this man to talk about things
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:35.520]   that need to be talked about
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.200]   and plan things that need to be planned,
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.600]   do things that need to be done.
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.000]   So here come some of the kind of things
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   where I think a husband should be taking active initiative.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.240]   What is the overall moral vision of the family?
[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:55.240]   He should take initiative in asking that question
[00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:58.480]   and pursuing an answer with his wife at his side.
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:02.200]   What do we believe about God and the world
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.880]   and family and culture?
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:05.840]   All families stand for something.
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:07.640]   All families are known for something.
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:12.440]   All families are called to glorify God
[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.240]   according to their gifts.
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:15.400]   What does that look like?
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:17.480]   And that's the man's responsibility.
[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:20.320]   Pursue that, figure that out.
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:23.600]   A man feels responsibility to take initiatives,
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:28.380]   to form and carry through that moral vision of the family.
[00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:30.440]   And of course, he's doing it
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.400]   through the constant interaction with his wife.
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.040]   She would not be thrilled
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.720]   to be left out of that formulation.
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.960]   But I think most Christian women are thrilled
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:43.040]   that the husband is taking the initiative
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.400]   and drawing her in to see to it
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:48.480]   that they have such a moral vision for the family.
[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:52.600]   And this would include initiatives like,
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:56.240]   let's clarify the expectations we have for our children
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.040]   and how they'll be disciplined.
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:02.640]   And then how my leadership will relate to the discipline
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.520]   and your leadership as the mother will relate
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.360]   to their discipline.
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:09.640]   And how they're gonna spend their leisure and so on.
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:11.840]   It includes things like taking initiatives
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:14.480]   and deciding on where the family goes to church
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.280]   and how they participate
[00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:18.720]   and whether they get there or not.
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.280]   It includes things like ministries,
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:23.200]   what the family's doing in ministry
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.440]   and how they're involved together
[00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:26.320]   in the neighborhood and missions.
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.880]   It includes things like taking initiatives
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:31.740]   with lifestyle issues for the family.
[00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:34.320]   Like what are we gonna do with social media
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:36.280]   and television and entertainment and leisure
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:38.320]   and sports and vacations?
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:41.600]   Every family has to make hundreds and hundreds
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.840]   of decisions about these things.
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:46.620]   And one of the things that depresses a wife
[00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:49.720]   is when a lackadaisical husband never thinks
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:51.520]   about what needs to be done
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:55.040]   and has to be constantly prodded to figure things out.
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:58.360]   She wants, of course, to have input.
[00:11:58.360 --> 00:11:59.620]   She's probably got more insight
[00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:01.020]   on a lot of these things than he does,
[00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:02.920]   but she wants him to take initiative.
[00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:04.400]   We need to think about these things.
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:06.320]   He needs to say, "Let's sit down.
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:07.640]   "Let's talk.
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:08.920]   "Let's pray."
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:10.640]   She wants him to do that.
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:13.040]   It includes things like finances
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:14.920]   and how the family spends its money
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:17.880]   and what they're gonna save for
[00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:19.680]   and what kind of insurance they're gonna have
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:22.720]   and retirement plans and pensions
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:25.240]   and the whole financial vision of the family,
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:27.320]   including how much they give to the church
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.360]   and all these things.
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:31.880]   The husband should feel a special responsibility
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:35.560]   to take initiatives, to work it out with his wife,
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:40.000]   constantly being drawn in to that initiative.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.400]   She's gonna have superior wisdom on many of these things,
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:48.840]   but she longs for a husband to take initiative
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:51.200]   to put the process in motion
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.000]   by which these things can be worked out
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.480]   and problems can be solved and plans can be made.
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.360]   Finally, perhaps most important,
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:04.840]   yes, the husband should feel a special responsibility
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:07.640]   to lead the family in a pattern of prayer
[00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:10.560]   and Bible reading and worship.
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:15.120]   And here again, the issue is not competency.
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:17.160]   He may have an eighth grade education
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.360]   and his wife may have a college degree.
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.680]   He can still take initiatives to see
[00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:25.080]   that the family is a prayer-saturated,
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:29.040]   Bible-saturated family by working it out with his wife,
[00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:30.560]   how she uses her gifts,
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:33.240]   which may exceed his own in Bible reading
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:35.240]   and Bible explaining.
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:40.240]   So I hope those few examples give a taste
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:42.480]   of what it means for a husband and a wife
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:47.480]   to model Christ and the church for a very needy world
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:50.680]   who needs so badly to see it.
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:51.520]   Yeah, amen.
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:53.600]   What a high calling for men,
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:56.080]   a beautiful calling of laying down our lives.
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.440]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.600]   And thanks for the question, Kelly.
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:02.440]   Tomorrow, we return to the theme of affirmation
[00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:04.040]   and praising others,
[00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:06.480]   specifically to the situation
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:10.120]   when we cannot genuinely accept affirmation from others
[00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:13.120]   because we assume that their praise is a means
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:14.880]   to get something from us.
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:18.480]   How do we kill the sin of habitually being suspicious
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.360]   of the motives of others?
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.680]   That's tomorrow.
