[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.660]   where we discuss science
[00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.880]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.040]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.200]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.000]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.280]   Today, we are discussing skin health.
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.640]   Our skin is an incredibly important organ,
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:20.880]   not just for our appearance
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.720]   or because it serves as a barrier
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.140]   to the other organ systems of the body,
[00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.760]   but because it actually reflects the health status
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.760]   of all the other organs and systems in our body,
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.560]   including our brain.
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.840]   As well, you'll learn today
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.680]   about the direct and reciprocal relationship
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.360]   between the immune system and our skin.
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.280]   And if you think about it,
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.260]   you've seen this relationship in action before.
[00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.800]   When any of us is feeling fatigued or sick,
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.800]   the color, the tone of our skin,
[00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.720]   tends to be a bit, quote-unquote, "off,"
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.960]   at least for us, relative to what it normally is.
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.780]   Conversely, when we are feeling particularly well-rested
[00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.800]   and vibrant and healthy,
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.660]   our skin reflects that.
[00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.600]   So today, we will discuss the skin as an organ.
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.740]   We'll talk a little bit about the biology of skin
[00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.120]   so that everybody's on board the nomenclature
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.600]   of the different cell types in the skin
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.520]   and how they're affected by various things.
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.300]   And then we will discuss those things,
[00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.820]   such as sunlight and sun exposure
[00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.840]   as it relates to skin cancers.
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.980]   We'll talk about sunscreens, of course,
[00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.880]   something that I know garners a lot of interest these days
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.440]   and even some controversy.
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.480]   We will talk about common conditions of skin
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.760]   that concern people, such as acne, rosacea,
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.120]   psoriasis, eczema.
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.200]   And of course, we will talk about
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.880]   so-called anti-aging treatments for skin.
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.780]   That is, the things that can be done
[00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.560]   to help reduce the degradation
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.200]   of the protein components in skin,
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.920]   things like collagen,
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.880]   things that you can do to improve collagen turnover,
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.040]   as well as elastin.
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.160]   These are other proteins within skin
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.920]   that give skin its youthful,
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.700]   or in some cases, where it's degenerative,
[00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.880]   non-youthful appearance,
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.720]   things like wrinkles and sagging skin.
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:54.960]   So we'll talk about all of that.
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.680]   We'll also talk about the various products
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.820]   that have been developed in order to treat wrinkles,
[00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.840]   treat sagging skin, reverse acne, et cetera.
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.600]   We'll talk about which ones are safe,
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.820]   which ones are not safe,
[00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.720]   and which ones for which there still is no clear answer.
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.120]   I want to make very clear here at the outset
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.240]   that while I'll discuss various skin products
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.840]   during today's episode,
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.840]   I nor the podcast has any financial relationship
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:19.840]   to those products.
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.720]   I will provide examples of certain products
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.080]   and provide a few links in the show note captions,
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.880]   but I want to point out that those serve merely
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.280]   as examples that I found during researching this episode,
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.120]   which by the way,
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.160]   included speaking to several board certified dermatologists,
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.880]   including a dermatologist expert in oncology,
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.440]   cancers of the skin.
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.800]   So by the end of today's episode,
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.640]   you will have a much clearer understanding
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.240]   about skin and what it is at the level of biology
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.160]   and function,
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.560]   its relationship to other systems in the body,
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.080]   including the immune system and gut microbiome,
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.520]   and you will be armed with the knowledge
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.920]   to make the best possible decisions for you
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.360]   in terms of skin health and skin care,
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.560]   depending on your age, your goals,
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.840]   and any current conditions you may have.
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:00.840]   Before we begin,
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.640]   I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.240]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.360]   It is however, part of my desire and effort
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.040]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.640]   and science related tools to the general public.
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.680]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.400]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.360]   Our first sponsor is Juve.
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.520]   Juve makes medical grade red light therapy devices.
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.560]   Now, if there's one thing I've consistently emphasized
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.360]   on this podcast is the incredible impact
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.280]   that light can have on our biology.
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.640]   Now, in addition to sunlight,
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.400]   red light and near infrared light
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.040]   have been shown to have positive effects
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.040]   on improving numerous aspects of cellar and organ health,
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.640]   including faster muscle recovery,
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.600]   improved skin health and wound healing,
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.720]   even improvements in acne, reducing pain and inflammation,
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.280]   improving mitochondrial function,
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.340]   and even improving vision itself.
[00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:47.800]   What sets Juve lights apart
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.540]   and why they're my preferred red light therapy devices
[00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.680]   is that they use clinically proven wavelengths,
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.960]   meaning it uses specific wavelengths of red light
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.020]   and near infrared light in combination
[00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.540]   to trigger the optimal cellar adaptations.
[00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.680]   Personally, I use the Juve handheld light,
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.160]   both at home and when I travel.
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.640]   It's only about the size of a sandwich,
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.880]   so it's super portable and convenient to use.
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.580]   I also have a Juve whole body panel
[00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.280]   and I use that about three or four times per week.
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.500]   If you'd like to try Juve,
[00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.480]   you can go to juve, spelled J-O-O-V-V.com/huberman.
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.280]   Juve is offering an exclusive discount
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.880]   to all Huberman Loud listeners
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.800]   with up to $400 off select Juve products.
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.720]   Again, that's Juve, J-O-O-V-V.com/huberman
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.480]   to get $400 off select Juve products.
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.640]   Today's episode is also brought to us by BetterHelp.
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.460]   BetterHelp offers professional therapy
[00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.120]   with a licensed therapist carried out entirely online.
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.080]   I've been doing weekly therapy for over three decades.
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.400]   Initially, I didn't have a choice.
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.800]   It was a condition of being allowed to stay in school,
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.000]   but pretty soon I realized that therapy is critical
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.880]   to overall health.
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.680]   In fact, I consider doing regular therapy
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.760]   just as important as getting regular physical exercise,
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.960]   which of course I also do every week.
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.220]   Research tells us that excellent therapy
[00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.360]   includes three critical ingredients.
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.760]   The first ingredient is a strong rapport
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.040]   between you and the therapist,
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.080]   somebody that you can really trust and talk to
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.080]   about the issues that are concerning you.
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.520]   Second, great therapy should provide support
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.120]   in the form of emotional support
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.840]   or directed guidance towards the issues you're facing.
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.880]   And third, excellent therapy should provide insights
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.680]   either directly from the therapist or that you arrive at
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.600]   that you would have otherwise not been able to arrive at
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.840]   had you not had that emotional support and strong rapport.
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.440]   With BetterHelp, they make it easy
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.960]   for you to find an expert therapist
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.560]   with whom you can have those three critical components.
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.300]   And because BetterHelp is carried out entirely online,
[00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.760]   it can mesh well with your schedule.
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.060]   You don't have to commute anywhere.
[00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.620]   You don't have to find parking.
[00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.340]   You can fit it into essentially any schedule.
[00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:43.600]   If you'd like to try BetterHelp,
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.240]   go to betterhelp.com/huberman
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.960]   to get 10% off your first month.
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.120]   Again, that's betterhelp.com/huberman.
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.100]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Roka.
[00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.200]   Roka makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.600]   that are of the absolute highest quality.
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.320]   I've spent a lifetime working on the biology
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.280]   of the visual system,
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.720]   and I can tell you that your visual system
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.440]   has to contend with an enormous number
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.200]   of different challenges in order for you
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.800]   to be able to see clearly from moment to moment.
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.560]   Roka understands all of that
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.080]   and has designed all of their eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.720]   with the biology of the visual system in mind.
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.200]   Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.880]   were first designed for use in sport,
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.120]   in particular for things like running and cycling.
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.240]   And as a consequence,
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.220]   Roka frames are extremely lightweight,
[00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:25.320]   so much so that most of the time
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.040]   you don't even remember that you're wearing them.
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.240]   And they're also designed so that they don't slip off,
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.760]   even if you get sweaty.
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.740]   Now, even though Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:34.480]   were initially designed for sport,
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.420]   they now have many different frames and styles,
[00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.480]   all of which can be used not just for sport,
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.520]   but also for wearing out to dinner, to work,
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.920]   essentially any time and any setting.
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.360]   I wear Roka readers at night or Roka eyeglasses
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.920]   if I'm driving at night,
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.200]   and I wear Roka sunglasses in the middle of the day,
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.020]   anytime it's too bright for me to see clearly.
[00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.360]   My eyes are somewhat sensitive, so I need that.
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.240]   I do not wear sunglasses in the morning
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.920]   when I'm getting my morning sunlight viewing
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:58.860]   for sake of setting my circadian rhythm,
[00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.520]   but I do wear Roka sunglasses often at other times
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.640]   throughout the day when it's very bright out.
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.460]   I particularly like the Hunter 2.0 frames,
[00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:09.920]   which I have as eyeglasses and now as sunglasses too.
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.120]   If you'd like to try Roka,
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.820]   you can go to roka.com/huberman

[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.640]   Okay, so let's talk about skin health
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.680]   and by extension, skin care.
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.760]   What should we all be doing to take care of this organ
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.640]   that we call our skin?
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.660]   Now, our skin is a very interesting organ,
[00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:30.500]   as I mentioned earlier,
[00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.160]   not just because it protects all the other organs
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.000]   of our body,
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.040]   and I should mention it protects them
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.840]   not just by a physical barrier,
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.300]   but there's also chemical things,
[00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.680]   a chemical composition, a skin microbiome to the skin
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:45.080]   that also provides additional layers of support,
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.160]   such as neutralizing different bacteria
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.440]   that land on your skin.
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:51.000]   There's a lot more to skin than you might realize,
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:51.840]   but to start off,
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.620]   let's just talk about what skin is
[00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:54.920]   at the level of its structure,
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:56.160]   some of the cell types,
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.540]   because in understanding that you'll be best equipped
[00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:00.260]   to understand some of the recommendations
[00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.640]   for skin health and skin care.
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:05.920]   The skin, like many other organs in the body,
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.640]   is a layered structure.
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:10.360]   So the very outermost layer is called the epidermis.
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.420]   The epidermis has cells in it,
[00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:14.700]   below that, there are other cells
[00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:16.920]   that comprise what's called the dermis,
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:19.040]   or sometimes referred to as the dermal layer.
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:22.360]   And then beneath that, you have subcutaneous fat.
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.040]   Now, of course, in different areas of the body,
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.040]   the skin, and as a consequence,
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:29.040]   these different layers of the epidermis and dermis
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:31.280]   and the fat layer below it
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.920]   are of different composition and different thicknesses.
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:34.760]   Think, for instance,
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:37.280]   about the thickness of the skin on your forearm
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.800]   versus the thickness of the skin on your belly
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:42.820]   versus the thickness of your skin on your eyelid.
[00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:45.040]   Okay, and as soon as you think about your eyelid,
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.700]   you realize, okay, this thing that we call skin
[00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:49.980]   varies tremendously in thickness,
[00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:51.620]   depending on whether or not we're at the scalp,
[00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:53.940]   the eyelid, the face, the chin,
[00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:57.080]   even neck versus chin, body, et cetera.
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.180]   So what we think of as skin,
[00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:02.380]   while it may have a designated set of layers
[00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:04.740]   that have particular names,
[00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:07.760]   can vary tremendously in terms of its overall thickness,
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:11.360]   and therefore its vulnerability to things like sunlight,
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:14.220]   which indeed can mutate the cells within the skin,
[00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:17.860]   cause them to have dysregulation of the expression of DNA
[00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:19.420]   and the production of other cells.
[00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:20.500]   We'll get into that.
[00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.220]   So I just want you to think about skin
[00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:25.020]   as having these critical components of layers,
[00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:26.700]   epidermis and dermis below it.
[00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.100]   And by the way, within the dermis
[00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:31.780]   is where you're going to find the blood supply,
[00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:34.660]   the vessels and capillaries that innervate the skin.
[00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:38.540]   Innervate simply means that supply or go to the skin.
[00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:40.320]   You of course have hair follicles
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:42.800]   and hair growing out of those follicles in many cases.
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.600]   And then of course you have skin that does not have hair,
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:46.800]   the so-called glabrous skin,
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.120]   like on the palms of your hands,
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.140]   the bottoms of your feet, et cetera.
[00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:51.800]   So I don't want to give the impression
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.520]   that skin is the same everywhere.
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:54.960]   It varies in thickness.
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:58.680]   It varies in terms of the presence of hair or lack of hair.
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.120]   It varies according to a lot of different parameters,
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:04.160]   including how much oil is produced in one region or another.
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.420]   But if you just know that the skin has an epidermis,
[00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:10.180]   an outermost layer, a dermis,
[00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:11.940]   or sometimes referred to as the dermal layer,
[00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:12.780]   which is below it.
[00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:15.620]   And then it has fat below that.
[00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:17.580]   And that the vasculature, right?
[00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:19.980]   The vessels and capillaries are at the level of the dermis.
[00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:22.780]   They come up through the subcutaneous fat
[00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:24.220]   and into that dermal layer,
[00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:25.960]   but they don't reach into the epidermal layer,
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.380]   that outermost layer.
[00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:30.940]   And if you understand also that nerve endings, okay?
[00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:33.980]   The little terminals, as we call them, of neurons,
[00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:36.960]   nerve cells, also go up into that dermal layer.
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.840]   You've got temperature sensors in the skin.
[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:40.960]   All of this becomes very important for our discussions
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:42.440]   of skin conditions.
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:44.800]   Things like rosacea, things like acne,
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:46.100]   which sometimes can be painful
[00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:49.040]   or can be exacerbated by things like heat.
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:50.880]   They can be suppressed in some cases
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:53.160]   or even activated by things like cold, okay?
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.400]   So if you just understand that there are three layers,
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:57.640]   epidermis on the outside, dermis below it,
[00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:00.520]   subcutaneous fat, and that skin varies in thickness,
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:04.260]   and that nerves, that is nerve endings and blood vessels
[00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.960]   and capillaries are within the dermal layers of the skin,
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.140]   well, you're going to be very well equipped
[00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:10.420]   for the rest of today's discussion.
[00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:12.420]   I'll throw in some additional information
[00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:14.980]   about oil production within the hair follicle
[00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:18.140]   and a few other things like extracellular matrix,
[00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:20.500]   which as the name suggests is extracellular.
[00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:23.060]   It's outside where the cells reside,
[00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:25.940]   but gives it its composition as either plump
[00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:28.160]   and moist appearing on the outside,
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:29.980]   or it can be kind of sagging and wrinkled
[00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:31.060]   and dry appearing.
[00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:34.140]   All of that relates to the different components of proteins
[00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:36.500]   and other things within those skin layers.
[00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:38.100]   But if you understand what I just told you,
[00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:40.340]   even at a crude level,
[00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:42.300]   if you can just imagine it just a little bit,
[00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:44.160]   those three layers,
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:45.340]   you're going to be very well equipped
[00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:46.860]   for the rest of today's discussion.
[00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:49.300]   I should also mention that there are glands within the skin.
[00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:50.900]   This won't be surprising to most of you.
[00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:53.380]   Those glands will produce oil either more or less,
[00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.100]   depending on certain conditions.
[00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:57.260]   And there are things that live on the skin,
[00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.940]   on that epidermal layer and within it
[00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:02.060]   that we call microbiota.
[00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:04.300]   You've no doubt heard of the gut microbiome, right?
[00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:06.600]   The existence of trillions of little micro bacteria
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.180]   that live within your gut,
[00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:11.080]   that provided they are varied in their composition
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.460]   and of the right sort,
[00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:14.100]   really support your immune system
[00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:15.180]   and other aspects of health,
[00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:16.980]   including brain function and health.
[00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:19.200]   Well, you also have a skin microbiome.
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:21.180]   That is the existence of microbiota
[00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:22.460]   on the outside of your skin
[00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:24.700]   that serve as a barrier to infections,
[00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:27.420]   but that also provide things that are nourishing to the skin
[00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:31.140]   and give it that vibrant look that most people want.
[00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:33.580]   And by cleansing your skin in particular ways,
[00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:35.780]   that is washing it with certain substances
[00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:37.500]   and avoiding other substances,
[00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:39.980]   you can support as opposed to diminish
[00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:41.680]   that skin microbiome.
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:43.480]   Okay, so to start today's discussion,
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.000]   I want to jump right into the deep end,
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.300]   meaning into one of the more controversial issues
[00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:50.220]   related to skin health and skincare out there right now,
[00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:53.460]   which is sun exposure and sunscreen.
[00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:55.880]   Now, it makes sense why this would be such a heated issue,
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:57.060]   no pun intended,
[00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:59.720]   because most everyone is exposed to the sun
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:02.000]   or has the opportunity to be exposed to the sun
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.340]   to some degree or another every single day,
[00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:06.500]   even on cloudy overcast days.
[00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:08.180]   It's also the case that we've learned a lot
[00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:09.880]   in the last 10 years or so
[00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:13.160]   about how different sunscreens and their components
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.700]   may be good for us, may be less good for us.
[00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:18.220]   And today we're going to talk about what is known
[00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:20.520]   and what is still unknown.
[00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:22.800]   But before we do that, we need to take a step back
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:23.920]   and look at the context
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:26.180]   in which all this controversy is happening.
[00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:29.420]   My read of the online community as a whole,
[00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:32.900]   as it relates to sunscreen and sun exposure in particular,
[00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:34.320]   is the following.
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.660]   I think most everybody, I didn't say everybody,
[00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:40.340]   but most everybody out there seems to accept the idea
[00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:42.620]   that excessive sun exposure
[00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:45.540]   can cause certain cancers of the skin.
[00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:47.260]   That's the general belief out there.
[00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:48.780]   And there is good reason for that belief,
[00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:52.080]   because indeed the sun as full spectrum light
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.620]   includes long wavelengths.
[00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:55.640]   It's probably easier to think about those long wavelengths
[00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:58.380]   as the reds and oranges and yellows and so forth
[00:13:58.380 --> 00:13:59.220]   that are present.
[00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:01.140]   And well, they're always present from sunlight,
[00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:02.660]   but they're most obvious to us
[00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:04.060]   when the sun is low in the sky,
[00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:06.880]   so-called low solar angle sunlight at sunsets
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.460]   and also at sunrise.
[00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:10.880]   But of course, as full spectrum light,
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:14.620]   sunlight also includes UV, ultraviolet light
[00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:15.460]   of different types.
[00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:16.540]   We'll talk about those types today,
[00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:18.740]   as well as blue light and green light.
[00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:20.700]   And in midday sun, when the sun is overhead,
[00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:22.860]   we just see the sun as white light, right?
[00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:25.040]   Because it's containing all those different wavelengths.
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:26.300]   So while this is not a discussion
[00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:27.380]   about wavelengths and optics,
[00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:28.540]   for sake of today's discussion,
[00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:30.540]   just understand that long wavelength light
[00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:33.900]   tends to be more of the red, orange, yellow variety,
[00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:35.140]   okay, loosely speaking.
[00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:37.540]   And down at the other end of the spectrum,
[00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:42.140]   the short wavelength light is more of the blue and green
[00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:44.400]   and so-called ultraviolet light.
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.540]   So it's well accepted light of different wavelengths,
[00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:50.180]   such as UV, blue light, green light,
[00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:51.500]   all the way out to red light,
[00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:53.900]   even near infrared light can penetrate into cells.
[00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:56.140]   It can actually pass through surfaces.
[00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:57.540]   It turns out that long wavelength light
[00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:01.080]   can actually go deeper into the surface of our skin, right?
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:02.660]   It literally can penetrate
[00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:04.340]   just by shining a red light on your skin.
[00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:07.160]   It can actually penetrate the skin to a deeper layer
[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.940]   than can short wavelength light like UV light.
[00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:12.080]   And it's well accepted that UV light,
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:16.340]   when it penetrates mostly that epidermal layer of the skin,
[00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:17.740]   that outermost layer,
[00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:21.280]   it can cause changes in the way that DNA functions.
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:24.200]   It can cause mutations such that DNA,
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.440]   which as many of you probably remember
[00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:27.640]   from high school biology,
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:30.840]   DNA is transcribed into RNA
[00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:33.400]   and RNA is translated into proteins.
[00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.320]   The proteins are the things that the cells produce.
[00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:36.900]   They're actually made up of proteins.
[00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:41.000]   Well, UV light can disrupt which DNA are expressed
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.760]   and how they are expressed,
[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:45.720]   in some cases leading to overproduction of too many cells
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:47.840]   or disruptions in the functions of cells.
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:52.320]   And that's why people link UV light to skin cancer.
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:53.880]   That's the whole idea there.
[00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:57.800]   And that's the whole notion behind using sunscreens.
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.320]   And notice I'm saying sunscreen.
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:01.820]   So ways to screen out UV light
[00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:04.280]   or maybe all sunlight in some cases,
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:07.200]   in order to prevent that penetration
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:10.080]   of the UV light into cells, which can cause mutations,
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:12.120]   which in some cases can lead to skin cancer.
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:13.580]   Now I realize as I'm saying this,
[00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:15.960]   there's probably a group of you out there saying,
[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:17.240]   what's the evidence that sunlight
[00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:18.480]   can actually cause skin cancer?
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:20.680]   Well, there is clear evidence
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:22.640]   that sunlight can cause skin cancers.
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:25.480]   Which skin cancers and how deadly those skin cancers are,
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:26.800]   we'll get to in a few moments.
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:29.000]   That turns out to be a very interesting twist
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.100]   in the whole story.
[00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:31.080]   But I want to highlight the fact
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.520]   that there's very little controversy
[00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:34.420]   as to whether or not UV light
[00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:36.500]   can cause mutations in cells, right?
[00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:38.080]   But what you should be asking yourself is,
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:40.880]   well, why would long wavelength light like red light
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:42.600]   perhaps be good for skin?
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:43.580]   We'll talk about that later.
[00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:46.240]   There are therapies, phototherapies that use,
[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:47.460]   that exploit red light,
[00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:49.360]   which can penetrate deep into skin
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:51.360]   that actually can enhance the health of skin
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:52.920]   if done correctly.
[00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:54.440]   Whereas short wavelength light,
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:55.900]   which only hits that epidermal layer
[00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:57.500]   on the outside of the skin,
[00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:59.180]   may be bad for our skin.
[00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:01.080]   And I say maybe because it's really a function
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:05.040]   of dose and timing and genetic background, okay?
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:06.880]   If all this is seeming rather complicated,
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:09.040]   I'm going to make it very simple.
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:10.680]   And before I do that,
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:12.840]   I do want you to ask yourself a question.
[00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:14.860]   I want you to ask yourself where you reside
[00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:19.060]   on the continuum of beliefs about sunscreen,
[00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:21.340]   UV light, and skin cancers.
[00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:22.340]   So here it goes.
[00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:24.500]   My read of the landscape out there
[00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:25.800]   is that there are some people,
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:26.820]   it's a small minority,
[00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:29.780]   but there are some people who feel that sunscreen
[00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:32.100]   in any form is bad for them.
[00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:33.620]   They think, okay, sun is great for them
[00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:35.100]   and sunscreens of any kind,
[00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:38.060]   chemical or physical barriers, bad for them, okay?
[00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:39.140]   Some people believe this.
[00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:40.140]   I'm not saying I believe this.
[00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:41.820]   In fact, I don't believe that.
[00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:43.000]   I'm a big believer in sunlight
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.680]   and the power of sunlight for health,
[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:47.760]   but I am not what is called a sunscreen truther, okay?
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:50.640]   I'm not somebody who thinks that sunscreen has no value.
[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:53.040]   In fact, quite the opposite under certain conditions
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:54.400]   and certain sunscreens.
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.080]   I want to say that for the record.
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:57.640]   Other people out there believe
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:00.280]   that certain sunscreens can be valuable,
[00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:03.080]   but only the sunscreens that lack certain chemicals
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:05.280]   because they are concerned about chemicals
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:09.240]   in certain sunscreens being so-called endocrine disruptors
[00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:12.260]   or maybe even causing cancer on their own, okay?
[00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:15.940]   Other people are so afraid of sunlight
[00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:17.860]   and believe that it causes so many issues
[00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:19.600]   as it relates to skin cancer
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:24.600]   that they basically create beekeeper uniforms for themselves
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:27.620]   so that anytime they're out in sunlight,
[00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:29.860]   they want to have sunglasses on, they want to have a hat,
[00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:31.820]   they want to cover their neck, every part of their body,
[00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:32.660]   okay?
[00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:34.180]   They sit at the opposite extreme of the people
[00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:36.820]   who don't believe in using any sun protection whatsoever.
[00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:38.740]   And now, of course, there's the backdrop
[00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:42.000]   of how much natural melanin production we each make,
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.560]   that is how dark our skin happens to be
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:44.760]   according to our genetics.
[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:45.840]   And of course, there's the issue
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:47.160]   of where we live on the planet
[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:49.520]   and how much sun we have available to us
[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:52.320]   in order to potentially expose ourselves to.
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:53.760]   And perhaps also ask yourself,
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.440]   if you are in what I believe
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:58.200]   is the largest category of people out there,
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:59.480]   which is the category of people
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:02.200]   who probably don't wear sunscreen every day,
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:03.480]   maybe they put it on occasionally,
[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:05.760]   but only if it's very bright out, very hot out,
[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:08.200]   because they don't want to get a so-called sunburn.
[00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:11.040]   And I believe most people fit into that general category
[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:12.880]   of A, not wanting to be burned,
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:15.800]   B, not wanting to age any faster than they would
[00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:17.320]   were they to not wear sunscreen,
[00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:18.680]   at least that's their belief,
[00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:21.400]   and C, they've just been told
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:22.720]   that sunscreen is good for them
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:25.880]   and they'll reach for whatever sunscreen is on the shelf
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.040]   or that was recommended to them
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:28.420]   either by their dermatologist
[00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:30.260]   or that they happen to find in the pharmacy
[00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:31.360]   or when they're out skiing
[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:33.000]   and they notice it's a bright day
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.160]   and so they buy some sunscreen and slather it on.
[00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:36.240]   So before I go any further,
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:37.560]   just ask yourself those questions.
[00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:38.480]   You know, where do you reside?
[00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:39.920]   Are you afraid of sunscreen?
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:41.080]   Do you love sunscreen?
[00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:42.480]   Are you in the beekeeper category?
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:43.860]   Like you think all sun is bad,
[00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:44.880]   it's going to give you skin cancer,
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:46.240]   it's going to age you faster.
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:47.840]   We'll get to the aging component in a few minutes,
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:49.480]   but just ask yourself that question
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:52.600]   as we wade into the material I'm about to cover.
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:57.520]   So what's the story with sun exposure, sunburn, sunscreen,
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:01.280]   skin cancer, and aging?
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:03.840]   I spoke to several different dermatologists about this,
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:08.040]   including one expert in skin cancers specifically.
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.320]   And what I was told is the following.
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:15.320]   First of all, sun exposure will disrupt the collagen
[00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:18.000]   and elastin, but mostly the collagen composition
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.560]   of your skin in a way that makes it appear
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:23.160]   as if you're aging faster.
[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:26.840]   Okay, so sun exposure, yes, ages the skin.
[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:28.440]   Now that does not mean, however,
[00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:30.260]   that you want to avoid all sun exposure
[00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:31.900]   because the same dermatologist said
[00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:34.160]   that some sun exposure is healthy for us.
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:35.000]   Why?
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.160]   Because our skin is also an endocrine organ.
[00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:39.080]   It's involved in making various hormones.
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:41.120]   It's part of the vitamin D production pathway.
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:42.200]   Although a little bit later,
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:44.160]   we'll talk about the fact that most people
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:46.440]   get their vitamin D from their diet,
[00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:49.040]   and in some cases also from supplementation.
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:51.560]   But it is a good idea to get some sunlight
[00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:52.880]   for sake of vitamin D production,
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:55.020]   but also the production of other hormones
[00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:57.000]   like testosterone and estrogen.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.240]   Okay, so every single dermatologist that I spoke to
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:02.700]   said that some sun exposure is good for us,
[00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:05.060]   but that too much sun exposure will accelerate
[00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:07.500]   the appearance of aging in our skin.
[00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:10.060]   So let's pin that up on the wall as fact, okay?
[00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:12.980]   This again is not saying you should avoid sun completely.
[00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:14.260]   It's also not saying you should get
[00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:15.860]   excessive sunlight exposure.
[00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:18.420]   It's saying sunlight exposure by virtue
[00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:22.580]   of the UV wavelength's ability to cause mutations
[00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:25.140]   in the epidermal layers of the skin
[00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:27.700]   and to impact the collagen composition
[00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:29.260]   of the dermal layers below it,
[00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:30.580]   as well as some of the other proteins
[00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:32.940]   present in the keratinocytes, okay?
[00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:35.360]   One of the major skin cell types
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:37.400]   and other cell types of the skin
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:41.480]   does lead to the appearance of aged skin,
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:44.280]   which is one rationale for wearing sunscreen.
[00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:45.560]   Now, when I say sunscreen,
[00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:47.160]   everyone, including myself,
[00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:49.520]   thinks about lotions or in some cases, sprays.
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:51.320]   But let's pay attention to the one fact
[00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:53.180]   that I do think everybody,
[00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:54.680]   regardless of what category they are
[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:56.180]   in the general population,
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:59.800]   or what background training a dermatologist has,
[00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:02.560]   believes, which is a physical barrier,
[00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:05.600]   a shirt, a hat, a jacket,
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:08.640]   a physical barrier can provide, in some cases,
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:11.360]   very good protection from the sun.
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:14.280]   And I don't think there's any controversy whatsoever
[00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:16.000]   as to whether or not the composition
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.040]   of the physical barrier
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:19.560]   is having negative effects on the skin, okay?
[00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:21.480]   You will find those niche communities out there
[00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:22.840]   that are saying, okay, certain chemicals
[00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:25.400]   present in certain materials that clothing are made with
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:27.060]   can be problems for the endocrine system,
[00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:29.140]   but we're not talking about that here, okay?
[00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:31.740]   What I'm saying is that all dermatologists I spoke to,
[00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:34.380]   and I think most every rational human being on earth,
[00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:36.180]   would say that a physical barrier
[00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:37.900]   can help to a great degree
[00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:40.700]   in order to protect our skin from the sun
[00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:42.660]   as it relates to sunburn,
[00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:45.820]   but also acceleration of the appearance of aging
[00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:46.900]   in our skin.
[00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:48.580]   Okay, so I don't think there's any dispute
[00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:50.860]   about physical barriers for protecting the skin.
[00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:52.860]   How much you want to protect your skin from the sun,
[00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:54.980]   well, that will depend on what category
[00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:57.360]   you decided you were in from the earlier discussion.
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:58.520]   We'll get back to that.
[00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:02.080]   What else did all the dermatologists and skincare experts
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:04.100]   that I spoke to also agree upon?
[00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:06.560]   Well, they all said that indeed,
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:10.160]   excessive sun exposure can increase the propensity
[00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:11.260]   for certain skin cancers.
[00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:13.920]   I want to go on record by saying, I believe that.
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:14.760]   Why?
[00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:16.480]   Well, because of this ability of UV light
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:18.920]   and some other wavelengths of light potentially
[00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:21.740]   to cause mutations in skin cells
[00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:24.520]   that can lead to certain skin cancers, okay?
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:26.700]   I don't think that's a debated topic out there.
[00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:28.020]   There might be a few people out there
[00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:29.740]   who are going to hang their hat on a study
[00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:31.180]   that I'll go into in a little bit later,
[00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:34.460]   which is that the relationship between sun exposure
[00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:36.660]   and all-cause mortality is a tricky one.
[00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:38.580]   It's one that we'll parse, okay?
[00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:40.460]   Meaning, I'll just give it a little hint
[00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:41.680]   into what I'm saying.
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:44.320]   People who avoid the sun entirely
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:46.600]   don't tend to live as long as people
[00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:48.120]   that get some sun exposure,
[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:50.300]   but there are a bunch of confounding variables
[00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:51.420]   that have to be understood
[00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:53.120]   in order to really interpret that statement
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:55.180]   and the study that we'll parse a little bit later.
[00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:57.200]   For now, let's just accept the reality
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:59.840]   that the vast, vast majority of dermatologists out there
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:02.520]   and skincare experts really understand
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:05.440]   that sun exposure can accelerate aging of the skin,
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:08.320]   but most will also tell you that some sun exposure
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:10.800]   is good for you, not just for skin health,
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:13.840]   but for overall brain and body health.
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:16.180]   Now, as it relates to skin cancer,
[00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:19.440]   the dermatologist oncologist that I spoke to, all right,
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:20.760]   who did his training at Stanford,
[00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:22.520]   and I'll provide a link in the show note captions
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:24.280]   to his clinic, and you can learn more
[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:25.160]   about some of his work.
[00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:27.120]   He's published some really nice papers,
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:30.320]   said the following, and this was surprising to me.
[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:34.360]   He said, "It turns out that the skin cancers
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:37.400]   that sun exposure causes, while they can be serious
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:40.520]   and should be taken seriously, they should be treated,
[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:42.840]   those generally are not the most deadly
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:44.000]   of the skin cancers."
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.080]   Now, why would he say something like that, okay?
[00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:48.440]   He said it because it turns out
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:51.160]   that there are lots of different kinds of skin cancer.
[00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:55.440]   Some of them arise or can arise through sun exposure.
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:59.480]   Others, and indeed, some of the most deadly of skin cancers
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:01.520]   are independent of sun exposure.
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:03.480]   And this is where things can get a little bit tricky.
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:05.120]   You'll hear out there, oh, you know,
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:06.800]   sun can cause skin cancer,
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:08.280]   but not the skin cancers that kill you.
[00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:10.440]   I don't think that's really a fair statement.
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:13.640]   You'll also hear, however, that all the skin cancers
[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:16.400]   that are out there are the consequence of sun exposure,
[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:18.000]   and that also is not true.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.840]   And if anything, this provides motivation,
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:21.360]   not just on the part of the dermatologist,
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:24.900]   but it should be motivation from within all of us
[00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:28.360]   to make sure that we understand our background genetics,
[00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:30.880]   not just how much pigmentation we carry in our skin
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:34.780]   by virtue of our genetics, but we should know by asking,
[00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:36.440]   if you're not going to get genetically sequenced,
[00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:37.800]   which you can do nowadays, of course,
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:40.640]   but you should know whether or not your family,
[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:43.400]   your genetics tends to carry certain mutations
[00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:46.400]   that make you more prone to skin cancers in general,
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:50.540]   not just the type that can be exacerbated by sun exposure.
[00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:51.380]   What I'm basically saying
[00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:54.400]   is that if you have particular genetics in your family,
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.720]   even if you avoid all sun exposure,
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:58.160]   you know, nobody should do that, of course.
[00:25:58.160 --> 00:25:59.080]   You need some sunlight.
[00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:00.800]   I mean, like all other,
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:02.800]   or most all other creatures on earth,
[00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:04.320]   sunlight is important for us.
[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:06.320]   It's important for setting our circadian rhythms.
[00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:07.240]   That's why I'm always telling people
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:09.020]   to get sunlight in their eyes early in the day,
[00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:11.420]   which by the way, when the sun is low in the sky,
[00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:13.160]   low solar angle sunlight,
[00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:15.780]   the UV index tends to be very low, okay?
[00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:20.640]   So you are at the lowest possible risk of getting burned,
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:22.720]   of getting any kind of mutations to your skin.
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.200]   That doesn't mean you should overdo it.
[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:25.440]   It doesn't mean you should stare at the sun
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:26.280]   and damage your eyes.
[00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:27.840]   I've talked about this a lot on other podcasts,
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:30.080]   how to get morning sunlight exposure properly.
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:31.860]   But when the sun is low in the sky,
[00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:34.260]   that's generally a safe time to get sun exposure.
[00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:37.480]   It's that midday sun, typically between the hours of,
[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:39.440]   you know, 11 AM or even 10 AM,
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.120]   depending on time of year and where you're at,
[00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:45.940]   and two or three or 4 PM that the sun is overhead
[00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:47.380]   and at its greatest intensity
[00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:49.340]   and where the UV index can be very high.
[00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:50.820]   It's very easy to look up the UV index.
[00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:53.140]   And when the UV index is very high, right?
[00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:55.060]   I was down in Australia earlier this year
[00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:57.540]   and the UV index down there is so high.
[00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:58.420]   You can almost feel it.
[00:26:58.420 --> 00:26:59.260]   You actually can feel it.
[00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:00.740]   You step outside and you immediately feel like,
[00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:03.620]   wow, my skin is really being bombarded with the sunlight.
[00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:05.620]   And I'm somebody who tolerates sunlight pretty well
[00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:07.140]   because my dad's fairly, you know,
[00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:08.860]   dark pigmentation just naturally
[00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:10.820]   by virtue of being South American.
[00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:12.640]   Normally I can tolerate the skin pretty well,
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:15.240]   but you should not rely on just that subjective feel.
[00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:16.580]   You should look up the UV index
[00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:18.760]   and we'll provide a few links of good UV index sites
[00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:20.000]   that you can look up the UV index
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.760]   and where you might want to be extra cautious
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:23.240]   about providing a physical barrier
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:25.680]   or a chemical barrier to protect your skin.
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:27.500]   Now, a lot of people out there also believe
[00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:31.800]   that if you avoid sunburn, you're avoiding skin cancer.
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:32.880]   Perhaps you're very pale
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:34.760]   or it's the early phase of the summer season,
[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:36.600]   or you have a susceptibility to sunlight
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:38.160]   such that, you know, you step outside
[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:40.400]   and you get too much sunlight on a given day
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:43.300]   and you get a sunburn, that reflects an immune reaction,
[00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:45.140]   an inflammatory reaction
[00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:47.180]   within the dermal layers of the skin.
[00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:48.900]   So that means the vasculature, right?
[00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:52.540]   Those vessels and capillaries, they're going to dilate.
[00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:54.380]   You oftentimes will get infiltration
[00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:56.740]   of things like cytokines, which are of the immune system.
[00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:58.380]   You get an inflammatory response.
[00:27:58.380 --> 00:27:59.220]   That's why it's red.
[00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:00.900]   That's why it's tender to the touch.
[00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:03.120]   The nerve endings there can be overly activated.
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:05.780]   So the reason why your skin actually feels warm, right?
[00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:08.780]   When you touch your sunburn is because in fact,
[00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:10.680]   you have an activation of some of the nerve endings
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:12.520]   at that site, as well as the activation
[00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:16.280]   of the local immune system properties that give rise to,
[00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:18.360]   again, vessel and capillary dilation.
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:21.560]   It's a wound of sorts induced by excessive sun exposure.
[00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:24.640]   Now, does sunburn cause skin cancer?
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:26.520]   There's no direct relationship
[00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:28.480]   between sunburn and skin cancer,
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:30.520]   except the fact that sunburn reflects
[00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:31.840]   excessive sunlight exposure.
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:34.140]   And yes, as I mentioned before,
[00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:37.680]   it's conclusive that excessive UV sun exposure
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:41.360]   to the skin can cause certain mutations in skin cells
[00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:44.080]   that give rise to certain skin cancers.
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:46.360]   Why are we parsing things at this level of detail, right?
[00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:47.520]   Is this all just semantics?
[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:48.920]   No, it's not just semantics.
[00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:52.600]   Many people believe that if they didn't get a sunburn,
[00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:56.640]   they are not at additional risk for inducing skin cancer
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:58.080]   or other issues with skin, right?
[00:28:58.080 --> 00:28:59.760]   We're not just talking about skin cancer.
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:02.280]   We're talking about accelerated aging of the skin,
[00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:03.800]   according to sun exposure.
[00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:05.260]   So let's make this very simple.
[00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:09.400]   You don't need a sunburn for the sun to accelerate
[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:11.840]   the aging appearance of your skin.
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:15.180]   You don't need a sunburn to induce the kind of mutation
[00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:17.140]   that may, again, I want to highlight may,
[00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:18.660]   give rise to a skin cancer.
[00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:20.640]   It's also not the case that if you've got a sunburn
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:21.820]   or even multiple sunburns,
[00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:23.900]   that you'll necessarily develop skin cancer.
[00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:25.260]   Although by virtue of the fact
[00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:27.620]   that sunburn reflects UV exposure,
[00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:32.140]   multiple sunburns would reflect increased UV exposure
[00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:36.060]   and therefore increase risk for certain skin cancers.
[00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:40.260]   So all of this to say, avoid sunburn however you can.
[00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:42.540]   And if you're somebody who just loathes sunscreen,
[00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:44.180]   that doesn't want to even hear the discussion
[00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:46.780]   we're about to have next about which sunscreens are safe
[00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:49.060]   and which ones appear to be less safe,
[00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:50.020]   if you're just one of these people
[00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:51.900]   that does not want to put sunscreen on
[00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:53.060]   because you're very concerned
[00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:56.460]   about whatever chemical might be in sunscreen,
[00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:58.900]   well then consider that the physical barrier
[00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:02.100]   of an article of clothing or a hat or a bandana of sorts
[00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:05.820]   can indeed shield you from the sun to some degree,
[00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:07.340]   often to a great degree.
[00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:09.500]   And again, I don't think there's any controversy
[00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:11.540]   as to whether or not those are safe.
[00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:12.420]   As many of you know,
[00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:15.320]   I've been taking AG-1 for more than 10 years now.
[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:17.780]   So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring this podcast.
[00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:20.540]   To be clear, I don't take AG-1 because they're a sponsor,
[00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:23.660]   rather they are a sponsor because I take AG-1.
[00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:27.060]   In fact, I take AG-1 once and often twice every single day.
[00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:30.540]   And I've done that since starting way back in 2012.
[00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:33.140]   There is so much conflicting information out there nowadays
[00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:35.300]   about what proper nutrition is.
[00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:38.280]   But here's what there seems to be a general consensus on.
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:40.620]   Whether you're an omnivore, a carnivore,
[00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:42.340]   a vegetarian or a vegan,
[00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:43.500]   I think it's generally agreed
[00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:45.040]   that you should get most of your food
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:48.060]   from unprocessed or minimally processed sources,
[00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:50.540]   which allows you to eat enough, but not overeat,
[00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:52.140]   get plenty of vitamins and minerals,
[00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:54.140]   probiotics and micronutrients
[00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:56.580]   that we all need for physical and mental health.
[00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:58.380]   Now, I personally am an omnivore
[00:30:58.380 --> 00:30:59.920]   and I strive to get most of my food
[00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:02.700]   from unprocessed or minimally processed sources.
[00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:04.680]   But the reason I still take AG-1 once
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:07.300]   and often twice every day is that it ensures
[00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:11.040]   I get all of those vitamins, minerals, probiotics, et cetera,
[00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:13.860]   but it also has adaptogens to help me cope with stress.
[00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:16.140]   It's basically a nutritional insurance policy
[00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:18.840]   meant to augment, not replace quality food.
[00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:21.060]   So by drinking a serving of AG-1 in the morning
[00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:23.100]   and again in the afternoon or evening,
[00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:25.740]   I cover all of my foundational nutritional needs.
[00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:28.440]   And I, like so many other people that take AG-1,
[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:31.460]   report feeling much better in a number of important ways,
[00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:34.620]   such as energy levels, digestion, sleep, and more.
[00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:36.020]   So while many supplements out there
[00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:39.180]   are really directed towards obtaining one specific outcome,
[00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:40.940]   AG-1 is foundational nutrition
[00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:43.100]   designed to support all aspects of wellbeing
[00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:45.620]   related to mental health and physical health.
[00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:47.020]   If you'd like to try AG-1,
[00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:50.480]   you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:51.900]   to claim a special offer.
[00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:54.020]   They'll give you five free travel packs with your order,
[00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:56.620]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:31:56.620 --> 00:32:00.580]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman.
[00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:02.340]   Okay, so before we dive into our discussion
[00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:05.420]   about sunscreens and the chemicals in sunscreens,
[00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:08.580]   let's just take a moment and talk about vitamin D.
[00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:11.120]   Vitamin D is important for a great number
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:13.460]   of bodily and brain functions.
[00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:14.700]   As I mentioned earlier,
[00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:17.660]   most people get their vitamin D from the foods they eat.
[00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:20.380]   If you eat dairy, in most countries,
[00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:22.860]   the dairy is fortified with vitamin D.
[00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:25.180]   Many people nowadays supplement with vitamin D
[00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:27.820]   anywhere from 1,000 IUs to 5,000 IUs.
[00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:31.620]   There are folks out there who perhaps even take 10,000 IUs,
[00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:33.660]   seems a bit high for most people,
[00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:36.740]   but it's going to depend on how much sun exposure you get,
[00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:38.300]   the pigmentation of your skin.
[00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:39.980]   But there are a number of people,
[00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:42.380]   especially in countries where they don't get
[00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:44.380]   a lot of sun exposure in particular times of year,
[00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:45.860]   and maybe they're not eating enough dairy
[00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:47.220]   fortified with vitamin D,
[00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:49.980]   who would benefit from vitamin D supplementation.
[00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:52.200]   And many people find they feel better
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:53.780]   when they supplement with vitamin D,
[00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:55.660]   but I encourage you that if you're going to supplement
[00:32:55.660 --> 00:32:58.380]   with vitamin D to probably start at the lower end
[00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:02.700]   of supplementation, like 1,000 to 3,000 IU, maybe 5,000 IU,
[00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:05.060]   best would be to measure your vitamin D levels.
[00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:07.180]   Many people are surprised to find that even
[00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:08.860]   if they live in a part of the world
[00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:11.020]   where they get a fair amount of sun exposure
[00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:13.380]   and they eat some dairy that's fortified with vitamin D,
[00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:14.580]   that for whatever reason,
[00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:16.620]   their vitamin D levels are still too low
[00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:19.020]   and benefit from supplementation with vitamin D.
[00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:21.420]   The dermatologist that I spoke to told me
[00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:25.780]   that yes, even if you wear sunscreen or a physical barrier,
[00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:26.940]   okay, this is interesting.
[00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:29.440]   Even if you wear sunscreen or a physical barrier
[00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:31.300]   when you get outside into the sun,
[00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:35.700]   it can still have a positive effect on your vitamin D levels.
[00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:36.660]   This was surprising to me,
[00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:38.260]   but then of course it makes sense.
[00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:39.980]   Sunlight is full spectrum light.
[00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:42.780]   It's not just UV and short wavelength light.
[00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:44.440]   The ability for longer wavelength light
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:47.180]   to penetrate the skin is clear.
[00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:50.660]   And those longer wavelengths can also impart
[00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:53.220]   a positive influence on the vitamin D pathway.
[00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:55.860]   Okay, so if you're concerned about wearing sunscreen
[00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:57.800]   because you're worried that it's going to impair
[00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:01.200]   your vitamin D synthesis or metabolism in any way,
[00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:04.000]   probably no reason to be concerned.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.380]   Now, if you're somebody who is in the beekeeper category,
[00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:09.660]   who's completely avoiding sun exposure for whatever reason,
[00:34:09.660 --> 00:34:11.420]   well, then you probably want to get
[00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:12.740]   your vitamin D levels checked
[00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:14.820]   and you may want to rely on supplementation
[00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:16.760]   or something of that sort.
[00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:20.540]   At the same time, because of variation in genetic background,
[00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:22.460]   there will even be some of you out there
[00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:24.020]   who are super anti-sunscreen,
[00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:26.380]   who are peeling your shirts off all the time,
[00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:28.020]   who are getting lots of sun exposure,
[00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:31.420]   who may surprisingly have vitamin D levels
[00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:32.260]   that are still low.
[00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:35.300]   That's rare, okay, for all the obvious reasons,
[00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:36.420]   but it could still be the case.
[00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:38.860]   And indeed, some of the dermatologists that I spoke to
[00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:41.620]   said they occasionally have a patient like that.
[00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:42.980]   Vitamin D, as you may recall,
[00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:44.740]   is involved in a bunch of different things.
[00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:46.140]   It acts as a hormone.
[00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:47.900]   It's involved in calcium absorption.
[00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:50.420]   It's involved in some of the other hormone pathways.
[00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:51.880]   And I should mention that there's a study,
[00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:53.860]   I'll link to this in the show note captions,
[00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:57.640]   that shows that some amount of sunlight exposure to the skin,
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:59.900]   this is an Israeli study where they had people, you know,
[00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:02.260]   get several tens of minutes of sunlight exposure
[00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:05.940]   in the afternoon during particular times of year.
[00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:07.900]   They didn't have them going naked outside, okay?
[00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:11.260]   This was sort of like context and culturally appropriate.
[00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:14.060]   Skin exposure to the upper body and to the legs
[00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:16.120]   could induce increases in hormones
[00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:17.780]   such as testosterone and estrogen,
[00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:19.740]   which were correlated with, it wasn't causal,
[00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:22.940]   but it was correlated with improvements in mood,
[00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:25.100]   well-being, libido, et cetera.
[00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:27.100]   Well, some of that probably relates
[00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:30.020]   to testosterone and estrogen synthesis directly.
[00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:33.340]   Again, the skin as an endocrine organ, okay?
[00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:34.860]   There are certain elements
[00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:36.980]   within the keratinocyte skin cells
[00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:38.980]   that can literally communicate
[00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:41.100]   with some of the organs of the body
[00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:42.740]   that produce testosterone and estrogen,
[00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:44.820]   even some of the glands, pituitary, et cetera.
[00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:46.340]   This is through a number of different stations.
[00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:47.780]   It's not necessarily direct,
[00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:49.140]   but also through the sun's ability
[00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:51.740]   to impact the vitamin D pathway
[00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:54.700]   that then impinges on those testosterone, estrogen,
[00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:56.820]   and things like luteinizing hormone pathways.
[00:35:56.820 --> 00:35:58.300]   We don't have time to go into all this now.
[00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:02.360]   I covered this in an episode about testosterone and estrogen.
[00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:04.500]   You have hormones such as luteinizing hormone,
[00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:06.060]   which then stimulate the gonads,
[00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:07.500]   the testes to the ovaries,
[00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:10.600]   to make testosterone and/or estrogen.
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:13.700]   The skin is a not so obvious player in this whole thing,
[00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:16.100]   whereby external environmental stimuli,
[00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:17.820]   such as the availability of sunlight,
[00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:21.500]   which in most places in the world varies across the year,
[00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:25.900]   can stimulate more or less vitamin D production,
[00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:27.160]   luteinizing hormone production
[00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:30.140]   that can impinge on testosterone and estrogen production.
[00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:32.740]   These pathways are one of the reasons why
[00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:34.500]   when we get the right amount of sunlight,
[00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:37.460]   not too little, not too much, we feel better.
[00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:39.140]   We feel better because certain hormones
[00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:40.700]   are being produced at certain levels
[00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:42.140]   when we're getting that sun exposure.
[00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:44.280]   And when we don't get that sun exposure,
[00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:45.840]   we have lower levels of those hormones.
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:46.940]   This is well-established.
[00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:48.740]   And the study that I linked to in the "Show Note" captions,
[00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:50.260]   which I've covered in previous episodes,
[00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:52.780]   is but one example of that phenomenon.
[00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:55.700]   Okay, let's talk about sunscreens.
[00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:58.180]   Now, the reason I changed my tone of voice with this
[00:36:58.180 --> 00:37:00.900]   is that if you look on the internet,
[00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:04.420]   you will see claims that I don't use
[00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:07.780]   or believe in sunscreen, and that is just false.
[00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:09.940]   I've worn sunscreen my entire life.
[00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:12.140]   I don't necessarily wear it every day.
[00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:14.220]   I don't tend to burn easily, okay?
[00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:16.160]   I have some natural level of pigmentation in my skin
[00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:18.460]   based on my genetics, as I mentioned earlier.
[00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:19.600]   But as we talked about earlier,
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:22.880]   just avoiding sunburn is not going to protect me
[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:25.600]   or anyone else against certain sun-induced mutations
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:30.120]   in skin cells and the aging effects that sun can have.
[00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:32.940]   So I do believe in certain sunscreens,
[00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:35.320]   meaning I will put sunscreen on on certain days,
[00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:37.480]   on certain parts of my body.
[00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:39.880]   However, I do believe,
[00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:43.000]   now having spoken to multiple dermatologists
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.660]   and looked into the literature very deeply,
[00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:49.280]   that there are certain chemicals in certain sunscreens
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:51.020]   that are of concern.
[00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:54.580]   I don't mean that if you put these on once or even twice,
[00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:57.600]   that you are going to suffer negative consequences.
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:58.900]   I mean, they are of concern,
[00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:00.940]   meaning we should pay attention to them.
[00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:02.800]   And when given the option,
[00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:04.920]   we should opt for the healthier choices.
[00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:08.740]   And in fact, there are known healthier choices.
[00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:09.800]   To make all of this very clear,
[00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:12.680]   I'm going to tell you what is very clear
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:16.240]   to the dermatology community at this point in time, okay?
[00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:19.980]   In June of 2024, here's what we know.
[00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:22.280]   There are two major types of sunscreens out there.
[00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:23.120]   Well, really three.
[00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:24.600]   We talked about physical barrier before.
[00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:26.160]   No one argues about a physical barrier.
[00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:27.760]   No one's worried about the chemical composition
[00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:29.640]   of physical barriers, okay?
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:31.120]   When we talk about sunscreen,
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:34.780]   so lotions, creams, sprays, et cetera,
[00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:36.200]   there are two major types.
[00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:38.520]   The first are organic types,
[00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:42.480]   which is essentially chemical sunscreens, okay?
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:44.160]   So when you hear organic sunscreens,
[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:46.240]   that means chemical type sunscreens.
[00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:48.700]   And then there are inorganic types,
[00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:51.720]   which are sometimes referred to as mineral-based sunscreens.
[00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:55.140]   Here's what most everybody seems to accept,
[00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:56.840]   that mineral-based sunscreens,
[00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:59.120]   meaning sunscreens that tend to include
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:03.480]   either zinc oxide or titanium dioxide,
[00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:05.960]   or both in some cases,
[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:08.200]   are generally thought to be safe
[00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:10.960]   up to concentrations of 25%.
[00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:13.200]   25% is a pretty high concentration.
[00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:15.320]   You can find sunscreens out there
[00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:20.320]   that have 25% zinc oxide or 25% titanium dioxide.
[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:22.040]   They're rare to find, however.
[00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:27.040]   More often, you'll find sunscreens that have 15%, 10%,
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:30.520]   18% zinc oxide, sometimes alone,
[00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:33.280]   or in combination with titanium dioxide.
[00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:36.360]   You'll find some pure titanium dioxide sunscreens out there,
[00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:38.600]   although those are a bit more rare, right?
[00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:40.320]   A little bit harder to find.
[00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:41.160]   Here's the story.
[00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:45.440]   Zinc oxide and titanium dioxide reflect back UV light,
[00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:47.020]   the short wavelengths of light,
[00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:50.980]   that would otherwise potentially cause mutations
[00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:53.920]   in your skin cells at the level of the epidermis, okay?
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:55.280]   In the outermost layers of skin.
[00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:56.360]   Remember, short wavelength light
[00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:58.320]   doesn't pass very deeply into the skin.
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:01.920]   Sunscreens containing zinc oxide and/or titanium dioxide
[00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:03.820]   were engineered for that specific purpose,
[00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:05.680]   to reflect back UV light.
[00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:09.060]   This is very different than organic or chemical sunscreens,
[00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:11.120]   which contain certain compounds.
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:14.680]   These go by different names, oxybenzone, avobenzone.
[00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:16.160]   There are a bunch of these different chemicals
[00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:18.360]   that are contained in so-called organic
[00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:19.960]   or chemical sunscreens.
[00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:21.040]   Those chemicals, in general,
[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:23.520]   don't serve to reflect back UV light,
[00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:26.160]   but rather absorb UV light, okay?
[00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:27.600]   So when they're applied to the skin,
[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:30.520]   they're designed to absorb the UV light
[00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:33.160]   so that the UV light can't negatively impact the skin.
[00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:34.960]   Those chemical, again, chemical,
[00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:38.480]   aka organic components within organic sunscreens,
[00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:40.760]   again, sometimes called chemical sunscreens,
[00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:43.000]   are designed to absorb UV light.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.120]   Mineral-based sunscreens,
[00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:45.960]   so-called inorganic sunscreens
[00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:50.380]   containing things like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide,
[00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:53.060]   are designed to reflect back UV light.
[00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:54.040]   Why am I telling you this?
[00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:55.500]   Well, I'm telling you this
[00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:57.280]   because it's generally believed
[00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:59.480]   that the zinc oxide and titanium dioxide
[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:02.940]   containing sunscreens are safe up to concentrations of 25%,
[00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:05.160]   whereas there is some, again,
[00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:09.920]   some concern about the chemicals within chemical,
[00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:13.640]   aka organic sunscreens, as potential endocrine disruptors,
[00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:16.440]   so disrupting things like testosterone synthesis,
[00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:18.640]   estrogen synthesis, and other hormones.
[00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:21.160]   It's not all just about testosterone and estrogen, folks.
[00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:23.560]   Other hormone pathways that many people,
[00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:25.220]   including some governing bodies
[00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:28.080]   and agencies that assess the safety
[00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:30.240]   of different cosmetic and sunscreen products
[00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:31.640]   are concerned about.
[00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:34.200]   Now, how concerned they are
[00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:36.420]   depends on where you are in the world, okay?
[00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:38.320]   So in Europe, they have different stringencies
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:40.840]   for what is considered safe versus unsafe
[00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:43.520]   or just of concern, as opposed to in the US.
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:46.240]   Here's what every dermatologist in the US,
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:48.980]   'cause those are the ones I spoke to, told me,
[00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:51.600]   which is that it is advised
[00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:54.880]   that on children younger than six months of age,
[00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:58.540]   you do not use chemical-based sunscreens.
[00:41:58.540 --> 00:41:59.380]   Why?
[00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:00.520]   Well, young skin,
[00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:03.640]   even the skin on the external part of the body,
[00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:05.520]   in children six months or younger,
[00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:07.120]   acts more like mucosal skin
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:10.200]   in that it can very easily absorb things transdermally
[00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:11.680]   through the skin.
[00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:14.160]   However, even as we age,
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:16.400]   so into puberty, our young adult years,
[00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:18.360]   and even into our elderly years,
[00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:20.120]   there is still a capacity for things
[00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:22.120]   to pass transdermally through the skin,
[00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:24.760]   although because of some of the additional barriers
[00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:27.120]   formed within the dermal and epidermal layers of the skin,
[00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:28.440]   things like extracellular matrix,
[00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:31.000]   the changes in collagen, et cetera,
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.400]   there is less tendency for compounds
[00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:35.400]   to pass transdermally through the skin.
[00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:38.040]   Now, that just simply highlights the fact
[00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:39.800]   that if you are a very young person
[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:42.440]   or if you're applying sunscreen to a very young person,
[00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:43.880]   maybe six months or younger,
[00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:45.680]   but also perhaps older,
[00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:47.880]   depending on how careful you want to be,
[00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:50.080]   to avoid these chemical-based sunscreens.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.440]   There is very little, if any, evidence
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:55.360]   that the mineral-based sunscreens
[00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:57.880]   are of concern for transdermal passage into the skin
[00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:00.200]   at concentrations of 25% or less,
[00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:02.960]   meaning sunscreens containing zinc oxide
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:05.280]   and titanium dioxide are probably safe,
[00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:08.320]   or at least have been deemed safe enough
[00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:10.080]   that they are freely available on the market,
[00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:14.400]   and we are told that they are safe for people of all ages.
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:16.320]   So if you are somebody who is concerned
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:18.080]   about the chemicals in sunscreen,
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:19.720]   most every dermatologist or chemist
[00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:22.320]   who works on sunscreens will tell you,
[00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:24.400]   well, mineral-based inorganic sunscreens
[00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:27.400]   are going to be your safer option if you're concerned.
[00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:30.640]   But get this, the chemical-based sunscreens,
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:32.560]   while some of the chemicals in them,
[00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:34.920]   indeed, can be quite scary when you read the literature,
[00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:38.040]   you look at some of these things like oxybenzone,
[00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:41.600]   avobenzone, and some similar chemicals,
[00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:42.920]   even at low concentrations,
[00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:44.760]   have been shown to be endocrine disruptors.
[00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:45.920]   People talk about how the fact
[00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:47.200]   when they apply these sunscreens,
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:48.360]   they can taste them in their mouth.
[00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:49.840]   There's a lot of fear around these,
[00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:52.400]   and some of that fear is substantiated.
[00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:54.240]   When one goes and looks at the studies
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:56.880]   that have been done on these chemical-based sunscreens,
[00:43:56.880 --> 00:43:58.980]   you may find it interesting to note
[00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:00.880]   that the way these studies were done
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:04.040]   often involves having people apply a ton
[00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:05.680]   of these chemical-based sunscreens,
[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:07.800]   like two full bottles of these sunscreens
[00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:09.920]   over the course of a very short period of time,
[00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:11.800]   and then have their blood drawn,
[00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:13.000]   and then it's revealed
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.520]   that some of these chemical components are within the blood.
[00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:17.880]   So a big issue that's not often discussed
[00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:20.040]   because it's very difficult to control for
[00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:21.040]   in a natural setting,
[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:24.480]   but is straightforward to control for in a laboratory setting
[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:28.620]   is how much sunscreen one is applying and how often,
[00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:31.960]   and across how many years of time.
[00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:34.560]   So there's no real prescriptive that can tell you,
[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:37.620]   hey, if you put chemical sunscreens on once,
[00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:38.480]   that's problematic,
[00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:39.480]   although certainly pay attention
[00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:41.160]   to that six months and younger,
[00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:44.400]   what is essentially a rule that I mentioned earlier,
[00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:46.320]   and do not put chemical-based sunscreens
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:47.680]   on really young kids.
[00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:49.200]   You might want to avoid them entirely,
[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:51.720]   depending on how stringent you are about this stuff.
[00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:54.280]   But when it comes to chemical-based sunscreens,
[00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:56.040]   personally, I avoid them,
[00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:57.200]   but then it becomes a question
[00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:59.360]   of if you could only use a chemical-based sunscreen,
[00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:01.000]   you simply look at the label.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:02.520]   Some of these have, by the way,
[00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:06.520]   zinc oxide, titanium oxide, and chemical-based components.
[00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:07.640]   Okay, keep that in mind.
[00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:09.720]   Some are purely mineral-based,
[00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:11.260]   some are purely chemical-based,
[00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:13.100]   but if you look at a sunscreen label,
[00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:14.840]   you know, okay, well, this is the only thing available
[00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:17.020]   on this very hot day with a very high UV index,
[00:45:17.020 --> 00:45:18.720]   and otherwise I'm going to get a burn.
[00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:19.600]   Well, if you're really concerned,
[00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:21.800]   then I would resort to a physical barrier.
[00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:23.320]   If you are less concerned,
[00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:24.600]   then you could perhaps tell yourself,
[00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:26.300]   okay, you get to put it on that day,
[00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:28.040]   but you might not want to use it every day,
[00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:30.240]   and you might want to use a small volume of it, right?
[00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:32.960]   Or maybe just on parts of your face or your ears
[00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:35.640]   or your neck that are particularly sensitive to sun.
[00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:36.480]   Okay, these are the things
[00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:38.560]   that need to be taken into consideration.
[00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:40.800]   But when we step back from all of this,
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:42.640]   all of the literature, including, by the way,
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:44.340]   some of the literature that assessed,
[00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:45.780]   and I'll put a link to this review,
[00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:47.980]   a review on the potential neurotoxicity
[00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:50.260]   of titanium dioxide nanoparticles.
[00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:51.660]   I'll get into this in a moment.
[00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:54.980]   It has been explored whether or not titanium dioxide
[00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:57.140]   is more risky than zinc oxide.
[00:45:57.140 --> 00:45:58.440]   We'll talk about that in a moment.
[00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:00.220]   But when you step back from all of this,
[00:46:00.220 --> 00:46:01.060]   here's what you get.
[00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:02.900]   Physical barrier, no one argues about that.
[00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:05.700]   No one believes that clothing is dangerous per se
[00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:08.300]   when it comes to avoiding excessive sun exposure.
[00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:11.060]   Again, excessive relates to your skin tone,
[00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:13.180]   your background genetics, your activities,
[00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:15.500]   and where you are in the world and what time of year, okay?
[00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:18.280]   Very specific to your needs.
[00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:19.740]   Very few folks are concerned
[00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:22.300]   about mineral-based inorganic sunscreen.
[00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:24.360]   So if you want to use sunscreen, as many people do,
[00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:25.200]   and you want to make sure
[00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:26.860]   that it's not an endocrine disruptor
[00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:29.180]   and it's not a neurotoxin or something else
[00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:30.020]   that's been raised
[00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:31.580]   for some of these chemical-based sunscreens,
[00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:35.620]   well, then find a sunscreen that has 25% less zinc oxide
[00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:37.860]   and/or titanium dioxide.
[00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:40.820]   If you were a bit more concerned about, say,
[00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:45.020]   titanium dioxide and some of the suggestive evidence,
[00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:46.140]   only suggestive evidence
[00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:50.380]   that maybe titanium dioxide is more risky than zinc oxide,
[00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:52.260]   especially when it's in its nano form,
[00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:54.420]   the very small form that may indeed allow it
[00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:57.180]   for more easy passage through the layers of the skin,
[00:46:57.180 --> 00:46:58.700]   that transdermal passage,
[00:46:58.700 --> 00:46:59.660]   well, then find a sunscreen
[00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:01.940]   that is purely zinc oxide sunscreen.
[00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:03.420]   And again, they always have other things in them,
[00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:05.460]   but what I mean is the only active ingredient
[00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:08.540]   in a zinc oxide-only containing sunscreen is zinc oxide,
[00:47:08.540 --> 00:47:10.020]   and then there are a bunch of other things
[00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:13.140]   that allow it to be a lotion, for instance.
[00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:15.380]   Again, up to 25% concentration.
[00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:17.380]   Why would somebody not want to use zinc oxide
[00:47:17.380 --> 00:47:19.300]   containing sunscreen up to 25%
[00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:21.500]   and opt for anything else, you might ask, right,
[00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:22.740]   if that's considered safe?
[00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:26.260]   The reason is the consistency of the zinc oxide
[00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:30.420]   is it's pretty sticky and thick and it's kind of pasty, right?
[00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:31.580]   Back in the '80s and '90s,
[00:47:31.580 --> 00:47:35.980]   some of you may recall that zinc oxide sunscreens
[00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:37.900]   that would actually color the nose white,
[00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:38.740]   so you could really see it,
[00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:40.100]   it was really prominent on the face.
[00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:42.140]   They tried to turn that into a fashion statement
[00:47:42.140 --> 00:47:44.020]   and didn't go over so well over time.
[00:47:44.020 --> 00:47:47.220]   But in any case, the addition of titanium dioxide
[00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:48.900]   to those zinc oxide-containing sunscreens
[00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:50.620]   allow it to be a bit silkier
[00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:52.220]   so that it would spread on more evenly.
[00:47:52.220 --> 00:47:53.060]   And then you may say,
[00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:55.980]   well, why even put chemicals in sunscreen at all
[00:47:55.980 --> 00:47:57.020]   if there's risk?
[00:47:57.020 --> 00:47:59.820]   The reason why chemical-based organic sunscreens even exist
[00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:02.620]   is that they can come up with compositions
[00:48:02.620 --> 00:48:04.300]   of those sunscreens that are very silky
[00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:06.300]   then that could spread on clear over makeup
[00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:07.700]   and things of that sort.
[00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:09.020]   But there are these concerns
[00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:10.600]   about some of those chemical components
[00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:14.540]   as endocrine disruptors and potentially as mutagens
[00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:15.820]   that could cause other issues
[00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:17.860]   or any number of different things.
[00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:20.340]   You can find all sorts of concerns out there on the internet.
[00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:22.240]   Most of those concerns are not substantiated,
[00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:24.260]   but these chemicals can be problematic
[00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:25.240]   at high concentrations.
[00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:27.180]   And that takes us back to the point made earlier,
[00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:30.060]   which is that in the studies of those chemicals
[00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:31.900]   and the reasons, in some cases,
[00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:33.220]   being banned in certain countries
[00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:36.580]   and other countries carrying warning recommendations,
[00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:39.500]   the amount of those chemical-based sunscreens
[00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:42.400]   that were applied was exceedingly high.
[00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:44.100]   So if you're wearing sunscreen very often,
[00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:45.380]   you're wearing a lot of it,
[00:48:45.380 --> 00:48:48.180]   probably best if you're towards a mineral-based sunscreen.
[00:48:48.180 --> 00:48:49.980]   If you are concerned at all
[00:48:49.980 --> 00:48:52.080]   about the chemicals in chemical-based sunscreen,
[00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:56.180]   wear a mineral-based sunscreen and/or use physical barrier.
[00:48:56.180 --> 00:48:58.100]   And if you're somebody who just doesn't believe
[00:48:58.100 --> 00:49:00.300]   that sunscreens are safe whatsoever,
[00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:03.500]   well, you know, as far as I know, it's a free world.
[00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:04.660]   You don't have to wear sunscreen,
[00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:06.860]   but then I would say you need to be very aware
[00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:09.460]   of the fact that sun can induce the appearance
[00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:11.940]   of accelerated aging in the skin, right?
[00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:14.140]   That's an actual process that takes place.
[00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:16.380]   There's really no debating that, frankly.
[00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:20.440]   And sun exposure can potentially accelerate
[00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:22.260]   or even give rise to certain skin cancers,
[00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:23.940]   and nobody wants that.
[00:49:23.940 --> 00:49:25.540]   Okay, before we move on to a discussion
[00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:28.100]   about what can be done to increase the youthfulness
[00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:31.380]   of our skin or the appearance of youthfulness in our skin,
[00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:34.540]   we need to have a bit more discussion about skin cancers.
[00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:37.460]   Notice I said skin cancers, plural,
[00:49:37.460 --> 00:49:39.940]   because there are many different forms of skin cancer.
[00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:41.620]   Some of them relate to sun exposure,
[00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:44.060]   as we discussed earlier, others do not.
[00:49:44.060 --> 00:49:46.340]   And in fact, some of the more deadly skin cancers
[00:49:46.340 --> 00:49:48.380]   are independent of sun exposure.
[00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:51.180]   They can relate to genetics and to other factors.
[00:49:51.180 --> 00:49:53.980]   So the most straightforward story about all of this
[00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:58.480]   is that approximately 80 to 90% of melanomas,
[00:49:58.480 --> 00:49:59.540]   which are skin cancers,
[00:49:59.540 --> 00:50:01.140]   and they are very serious skin cancers
[00:50:01.140 --> 00:50:03.420]   that can indeed be very deadly,
[00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:05.500]   arise in what's called de novo skin.
[00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:08.820]   De novo skin is non-mole skin.
[00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:11.340]   Now, does that mean that you should not pay attention
[00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:13.580]   to the shape and any changes in your moles?
[00:50:13.580 --> 00:50:15.480]   No, you absolutely should.
[00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:18.100]   But for people who have naturally darker pigmentation
[00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:21.660]   everywhere or who have very few moles,
[00:50:21.660 --> 00:50:23.380]   then you aren't going to be able to use
[00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:26.100]   the monitoring of your moles as the only readout
[00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:27.860]   of potential development of skin cancer.
[00:50:27.860 --> 00:50:30.120]   And frankly, everybody should be thinking about
[00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:31.460]   these more serious skin cancers
[00:50:31.460 --> 00:50:34.180]   independent of moles or changes in moles.
[00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:35.080]   Here are a couple of things
[00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:37.200]   that everyone should pay attention to.
[00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:41.040]   If you have a pimple-like lesion,
[00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:44.460]   or you have any kind of spot on your skin
[00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:46.700]   that seems like it's an acne
[00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:48.880]   that's lasted more than a month,
[00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:50.820]   or you have an area that's seeping something
[00:50:50.820 --> 00:50:53.760]   that might look like plasma or pus or blood,
[00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:55.820]   and it persists over a long period of time,
[00:50:55.820 --> 00:50:57.100]   like a month or more,
[00:50:57.100 --> 00:51:00.780]   absolutely get that checked out by a dermatologist, okay?
[00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:03.280]   Don't wait any longer than a month, get it checked out.
[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:06.440]   In addition, it's highly recommended that you go in
[00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:09.500]   and you get your moles checked by a dermatologist.
[00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:12.060]   And frankly, that you get all of your skin checked
[00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:14.860]   by a dermatologist at least once per year.
[00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:17.020]   This is going to really protect you
[00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:19.060]   against both the sun-induced skin cancers
[00:51:19.060 --> 00:51:20.600]   and other forms of skin cancer,
[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:23.660]   the most common form of sun exposure-induced cancers
[00:51:23.660 --> 00:51:25.020]   are basal cell carcinomas.
[00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:26.520]   And indeed, those are less deadly
[00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:28.120]   than many of the melanomas,
[00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:30.180]   but they still can be exceedingly problematic
[00:51:30.180 --> 00:51:31.540]   and they can be deadly.
[00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:33.320]   So it's very important to get these checked out.
[00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:34.260]   Now there are websites,
[00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:35.640]   and I'll provide a link to one of them
[00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:37.180]   in the show note captions,
[00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:39.360]   for which you can look at a bunch of different examples
[00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:41.420]   of different moles and how they change over time.
[00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:42.540]   And if you happen to have a mole
[00:51:42.540 --> 00:51:43.700]   that resembles the appearance
[00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:46.360]   of any of the moles in that image gallery,
[00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:48.900]   then you would be wise to go to a dermatologist right away
[00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:52.400]   because it could be, again, could be cancer of some sort.
[00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:55.240]   You do not want to let these things linger for too long.
[00:51:55.240 --> 00:51:56.080]   At the same time,
[00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:58.460]   many people get concerned about one mole
[00:51:58.460 --> 00:51:59.900]   that didn't have an irregular border
[00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:01.500]   and then suddenly has an irregular border.
[00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:02.880]   There are a lot of different features
[00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:04.460]   that you'll learn from the website,
[00:52:04.460 --> 00:52:06.000]   or if you talk to your dermatologist
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:07.420]   that relate to whether or not something
[00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:10.160]   is predicting skin cancer or has become skin cancer.
[00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:13.160]   It's not just irregular border, it's changes in size,
[00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:16.100]   certainly changes in pigmentation, vascularization,
[00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:17.560]   bleeding, any kind of seeping.
[00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:18.960]   There are a lot of different things there.
[00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:20.880]   So don't be alarmed at first appearance
[00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:23.680]   of one of these things, but do take it seriously.
[00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:25.000]   And keep in mind that there are things
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:26.680]   that your dermatologist can do
[00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:28.400]   to help prevent certain skin cancer.
[00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:30.920]   So for instance, there's a growing trend now
[00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:35.360]   among dermatologists to suggest laser resurfacing of skin.
[00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:39.400]   That is a laser used to essentially disrupt
[00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:41.240]   that epidermal outermost layer,
[00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:43.540]   turn it over so that it regenerates
[00:52:43.540 --> 00:52:46.480]   'cause it can indeed regenerate to create new cells there.
[00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:48.240]   Keep in mind that UV light and other factors
[00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:49.760]   in the environment can cause mutations
[00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:51.080]   within that skin layer.
[00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:53.040]   Sometimes they're caused by genetic factors,
[00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:54.800]   but often environmental factors like sun
[00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:56.480]   and chemicals and other things.
[00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:58.780]   And by encouraging turnover of that skin layer
[00:52:58.780 --> 00:53:01.100]   through laser resurfacing, which by the way,
[00:53:01.100 --> 00:53:03.760]   may also increase the sort of youthfulness appearance
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:05.280]   of your skin, so many people are motivated
[00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:08.460]   to do it for that reason, can dramatically reduce
[00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:10.960]   the incidence of certain kinds of skin cancer.
[00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:13.320]   In fact, the dermatologist that I spoke to
[00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:16.820]   who's an expert in derm oncology, okay, cancers of the skin,
[00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:20.400]   said that laser resurfacing can cause a 30% reduction
[00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:22.360]   in skin cancers because of this ability
[00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:24.220]   to rejuvenate that epidermal layer.
[00:53:24.220 --> 00:53:26.360]   And that's especially true for areas of the body
[00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:30.520]   like the face, ears, neck, tops of the hands, et cetera,
[00:53:30.520 --> 00:53:33.460]   for which the sun often induces the most damage
[00:53:33.460 --> 00:53:35.520]   because those are the most exposed parts of the body
[00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:36.840]   on a regular basis.
[00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:38.760]   And by the way, this whole thing about skin cancer
[00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:42.360]   is not a trivially small number, it's a big number.
[00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:46.040]   In the US alone, there are up to 4 million cases per year
[00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:47.960]   of what's called squamous cell carcinoma,
[00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:49.600]   one of these forms of skin cancer.
[00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:52.240]   So getting checked out by a highly qualified dermatologist
[00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:53.940]   on a yearly basis, maybe even more,
[00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:55.240]   if you're really concerned about this,
[00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:56.900]   'cause you have a lot of familial,
[00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:59.400]   genetically inherited skin cancers,
[00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:02.940]   things of that sort is really highly advised.
[00:54:02.940 --> 00:54:04.080]   I'd like to take a brief break
[00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:06.600]   and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Element.
[00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:07.920]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:09.280]   that has everything you need.
[00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:11.480]   That means the electrolytes, sodium, magnesium,
[00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:14.240]   and potassium in the correct amounts and ratios
[00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:16.560]   and nothing you don't, which means no sugar.
[00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:18.280]   Now, I and others on this podcast
[00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:20.560]   have talked about the critical importance of hydration
[00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:22.160]   for proper brain and body functioning.
[00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:24.080]   Even a slight degree of dehydration
[00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:26.560]   can diminish cognitive and physical performance.
[00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:28.880]   It's also important that you get adequate electrolytes.
[00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:31.860]   The electrolytes, sodium, magnesium, and potassium
[00:54:31.860 --> 00:54:33.040]   are critical for the functioning
[00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:34.560]   of all the cells in your body,
[00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:36.640]   especially your neurons, your nerve cells.
[00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:38.080]   Drinking Element dissolved in water
[00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:39.440]   makes it very easy to ensure
[00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:41.200]   that you're getting adequate hydration
[00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:42.800]   and adequate electrolytes.
[00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:44.280]   To make sure I'm getting proper amounts
[00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:46.020]   of hydration and electrolytes,
[00:54:46.020 --> 00:54:47.840]   I dissolve one packet of Element
[00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:49.840]   in about 16 to 32 ounces of water
[00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:51.080]   when I wake up in the morning,
[00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:53.600]   and I drink that basically first thing in the morning.
[00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:55.720]   I'll also drink Element dissolved in water
[00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:57.600]   during any kind of physical exercise I'm doing,
[00:54:57.600 --> 00:54:59.980]   especially in hot days when I'm sweating a lot,
[00:54:59.980 --> 00:55:02.040]   losing water and electrolytes.
[00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:02.960]   They have a bunch of different
[00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:04.620]   great tasting flavors of Element.
[00:55:04.620 --> 00:55:06.200]   My favorite is the watermelon,
[00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:08.080]   although I confess I also like the raspberry
[00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:08.920]   and the citrus.
[00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:10.760]   Basically, I like all the flavors.
[00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:12.800]   And Element has also just released a new line
[00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:14.320]   of canned sparkling Element.
[00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:16.060]   So these aren't the packets you dissolve in water.
[00:55:16.060 --> 00:55:18.440]   These are cans of Element that you crack open
[00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:20.760]   like any other canned drink, like a soda,
[00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:22.080]   but you're getting your hydration
[00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:23.960]   and your electrolytes with no sugar.
[00:55:23.960 --> 00:55:25.120]   If you'd like to try Element,
[00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:29.980]   you can go to drinkelement, spelled L-M-N-T.com/huberman,
[00:55:29.980 --> 00:55:31.620]   to claim a free Element sample pack
[00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:33.480]   with the purchase of any Element drink mix.
[00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:36.520]   Again, that's drinkelement.com/huberman
[00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:38.200]   to claim a free sample pack.
[00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:39.800]   Now, with respect to everything we've talked about
[00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:43.480]   about sun exposure, sunscreen, and skin cancer,
[00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:45.300]   I'd be remiss if I didn't discuss a study
[00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:50.200]   that's often used kind of as a wedge or a weapon
[00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:52.960]   in the online debates about sun exposure,
[00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:54.520]   skin cancer, and mortality.
[00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:56.760]   And the title of this study is quote,
[00:55:56.760 --> 00:55:59.100]   "Avoidance of sun exposure as a risk factor."
[00:55:59.100 --> 00:56:01.240]   That's right, sun exposure as a risk factor
[00:56:01.240 --> 00:56:04.240]   "for major causes of death, a competing risk analysis
[00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:07.400]   "of the melanoma in Southern Sweden cohort."
[00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:08.700]   So the basic design of this study
[00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:11.400]   was to evaluate people's self-reported amount
[00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:14.200]   of sun exposure across many years,
[00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:17.520]   and then to correlate that with all-cause mortality,
[00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:19.400]   and then to relate it to different causes of disease,
[00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:20.880]   in particular, cardiovascular death,
[00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:22.280]   compare this to smokers.
[00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:23.720]   Keep in mind that some of the people
[00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:25.760]   who were reporting their sun exposure were smokers,
[00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:26.860]   some weren't.
[00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:29.100]   And the conclusion of this study
[00:56:29.100 --> 00:56:30.480]   that drew a lot of attention
[00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:33.440]   and continues to draw a lot of attention is the following.
[00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:35.280]   Quote, and here I quote from the abstract,
[00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:38.680]   "Non-smokers who avoided sun exposure
[00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:41.920]   "had a life expectancy similar to smokers
[00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:44.200]   "in the highest sun exposure group."
[00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:45.600]   Okay, I'm going to repeat that.
[00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:48.280]   "Non-smokers who avoided sun exposure
[00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:50.820]   "had a life expectancy similar to smokers
[00:56:50.820 --> 00:56:53.560]   "in the highest sun exposure group."
[00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:56.960]   So what many people take this to conclude
[00:56:56.960 --> 00:57:00.160]   is that avoiding sun exposure is as dangerous
[00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:01.600]   as smoking, okay?
[00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:05.520]   That's not the conclusion that I'd like you to take away,
[00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:07.860]   because what this study basically shows is,
[00:57:07.860 --> 00:57:09.160]   and here I continue, quote,
[00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:11.780]   "Compared to the highest sun exposure group,
[00:57:11.780 --> 00:57:14.700]   "life expectancy of avoiders of sun exposure
[00:57:14.700 --> 00:57:19.700]   "was reduced by 0.6 to 2.1 years."
[00:57:19.700 --> 00:57:20.960]   So you go, wait a second.
[00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:21.960]   Can this really be true,
[00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:25.080]   that people that are avoiding sun exposure
[00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:27.720]   have a lower life expectancy
[00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:29.680]   than people who get sun exposure?
[00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:31.600]   And indeed, in this particular study,
[00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:33.440]   that does seem to be the case,
[00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:35.160]   but the interpretation of this
[00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:36.840]   is not completely straightforward.
[00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:38.400]   Here's what we know.
[00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:40.200]   Getting some degree of sun exposure
[00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:43.120]   appears to be good for life expectancy.
[00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:44.480]   That is true.
[00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:47.940]   But is it directly related to sun exposure?
[00:57:47.940 --> 00:57:49.520]   That's a critical question.
[00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:52.260]   And is the increased sun exposure that one gets,
[00:57:52.260 --> 00:57:53.900]   if you do get sun exposure,
[00:57:53.900 --> 00:57:55.120]   linked to other issues,
[00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:58.580]   in particular, the development of melanoma?
[00:57:58.580 --> 00:58:02.740]   As you recall, melanoma was even in the title of the study.
[00:58:02.740 --> 00:58:05.840]   So here's how I think we should think about this study.
[00:58:05.840 --> 00:58:07.980]   It does appear that getting sun exposure
[00:58:07.980 --> 00:58:10.820]   is correlated with longer life expectancy,
[00:58:10.820 --> 00:58:13.080]   but there could be any number of different reasons for that.
[00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:16.300]   For instance, people that are getting regular sun exposure,
[00:58:16.300 --> 00:58:19.080]   presumably, are also enhancing activation
[00:58:19.080 --> 00:58:20.440]   of the vitamin D pathways,
[00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:22.640]   which is related to any number of different things.
[00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:24.720]   They, no doubt, are experiencing
[00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:26.400]   increased feelings of well-being.
[00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:29.100]   I talked about papers that have substantiated that earlier.
[00:58:29.100 --> 00:58:32.040]   And frankly, we didn't even need a scientific study
[00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:32.980]   to substantiate that,
[00:58:32.980 --> 00:58:34.880]   although it's always great to have it.
[00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:36.460]   We know that being out in sunshine
[00:58:36.460 --> 00:58:37.700]   for some period of time each day,
[00:58:37.700 --> 00:58:40.500]   as long as we don't get burned in the sun, feels good.
[00:58:40.500 --> 00:58:41.340]   Why does it feel good?
[00:58:41.340 --> 00:58:45.000]   It leads to the production of testosterone, estrogen,
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:47.500]   some of the endorphins that generally make us feel good.
[00:58:47.500 --> 00:58:49.720]   It is directly related to the pathways
[00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:51.580]   associated with dopamine release.
[00:58:51.580 --> 00:58:53.940]   There's a whole story there about seasonality,
[00:58:53.940 --> 00:58:55.420]   both in humans and other animals,
[00:58:55.420 --> 00:58:57.840]   about dopamine synthesis.
[00:58:57.840 --> 00:59:00.200]   When we get sunlight, there's elevated dopamine
[00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:02.540]   and serotonin and testosterone and estrogen
[00:59:02.540 --> 00:59:04.460]   and feelings of well-being and libido.
[00:59:04.460 --> 00:59:08.440]   This is all well-substantiated in animal models and humans.
[00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:10.720]   So getting sun exposure makes people feel good.
[00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:13.060]   When people feel good, they tend to be lower stress.
[00:59:13.060 --> 00:59:16.300]   When people are feeling good and they have energy,
[00:59:16.300 --> 00:59:18.460]   because there indeed is a direct relationship
[00:59:18.460 --> 00:59:19.400]   between sun exposure,
[00:59:19.400 --> 00:59:21.340]   especially to the eyes early in the day,
[00:59:21.340 --> 00:59:25.820]   and our feelings of elevated mood and alertness and energy,
[00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:27.580]   they tend to exercise more, walk more.
[00:59:27.580 --> 00:59:30.140]   And of course, if you're outside exercising more,
[00:59:30.140 --> 00:59:32.160]   walking more, cycling, swimming,
[00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:34.800]   you're also going to get more sun exposure.
[00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:38.340]   And we know that exercise is strongly related
[00:59:38.340 --> 00:59:42.220]   to improved or extended life expectancy.
[00:59:42.220 --> 00:59:46.240]   Okay, so the study basically says getting sunlight
[00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:47.780]   as opposed to very little sunlight
[00:59:47.780 --> 00:59:49.140]   is good for life expectancy,
[00:59:49.140 --> 00:59:52.140]   but it doesn't say get too much sunlight, right?
[00:59:52.140 --> 00:59:54.520]   Because, and this is interesting,
[00:59:54.520 --> 00:59:57.140]   it is very clear that the people who lived longer
[00:59:57.140 --> 00:59:59.140]   because they were getting more sunlight
[00:59:59.140 --> 01:00:02.980]   also tended to have more cancers, including melanoma.
[01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:05.420]   But this is a very important point.
[01:00:05.420 --> 01:00:08.620]   It's also the case that the longer one lives,
[01:00:08.620 --> 01:00:11.260]   the more likely you are to develop a cancer, okay?
[01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:12.580]   So as you can see,
[01:00:12.580 --> 01:00:15.000]   these studies that many people
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.280]   just draw one straightforward conclusion from,
[01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:19.540]   such as people who get less sun exposure
[01:00:19.540 --> 01:00:21.620]   don't live as long as people to get more sun exposure.
[01:00:21.620 --> 01:00:22.600]   Well, that's true.
[01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:24.440]   But when you get more sun exposure,
[01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:26.780]   very likely you're doing other things like exercise
[01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:28.780]   and feeling better that relate to living longer.
[01:00:28.780 --> 01:00:29.660]   So it's very difficult,
[01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:32.480]   if not impossible to isolate one single variable,
[01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:35.340]   in this case, sun exposure as the key variable.
[01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:38.660]   However, I'm happy to go on record saying that
[01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:42.920]   we know from so many studies of animal models and humans
[01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:45.860]   that sun exposure, especially early day sun exposure,
[01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:48.760]   when the sun is low in the sky to set your circadian rhythm
[01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:50.720]   and late day sun exposure, okay?
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:52.480]   I'm not talking about middle of the day,
[01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:55.240]   getting baked in the sun and sunburned
[01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:56.080]   or things of that sort.
[01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:57.580]   But around the time of sunset,
[01:00:57.580 --> 01:00:59.580]   especially sun exposure to the eyes,
[01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:02.300]   is powerfully modulating your circadian rhythm
[01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:04.480]   to elevate daytime mood focus and alertness
[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:05.820]   and improve sleep.
[01:01:05.820 --> 01:01:07.940]   Both of which are strongly correlated
[01:01:07.940 --> 01:01:09.480]   with improvements in mental health,
[01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:10.680]   immune system function,
[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:13.720]   feelings of wellbeing, enhanced cognition.
[01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:14.800]   I mean, there's this whole story
[01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:16.060]   about people with Alzheimer's
[01:01:16.060 --> 01:01:18.560]   and disruptions in circadian rhythms and sleep.
[01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:20.660]   So sun exposure to the eyes
[01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:24.040]   in terms of setting circadian rhythm, powerful.
[01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:26.820]   Powerful improvement of life expectancy
[01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:29.200]   and immediate health.
[01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:31.720]   Sun exposure to the skin, no doubt,
[01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:33.980]   very powerful positive modulators
[01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:36.760]   of certain hormone and neuromodulator pathways
[01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:39.980]   such as dopamine, testosterone, estrogen, and so forth
[01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:41.280]   that make people feel good
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:43.480]   and do things generally that are good for them.
[01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:45.480]   Okay, generally, not all the things people do
[01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:47.440]   with elevated dopamine, testosterone, and estrogen
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:48.280]   are good for them.
[01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:49.500]   We know that for sure.
[01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:51.720]   But getting some sunlight,
[01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:54.880]   that is some appropriate dosage of sunlight,
[01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:56.660]   especially to the eyes early in the day.
[01:01:56.660 --> 01:01:58.560]   Don't stare at the sun, don't damage your eyes,
[01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:00.280]   but getting some of that sun exposure
[01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:01.240]   to your eyes early in the day
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:02.600]   and some to the skin,
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:05.040]   especially in the early and later part of the day,
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:06.960]   clearly is positively correlated
[01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:08.880]   with various health metrics
[01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:10.800]   in terms of mental health and physical health
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:13.120]   and not surprisingly with lifespan.
[01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:13.960]   So I mentioned the study
[01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:15.880]   'cause I do think it's very interesting, right?
[01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:16.920]   I think it's really interesting
[01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:19.280]   that people who completely avoid sunlight
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:23.240]   are not living as long as people who get some sun exposure.
[01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:24.800]   And some of this actually is on par
[01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:27.620]   with what's experienced with cigarette smoking.
[01:02:27.620 --> 01:02:29.040]   I think something that everyone agrees
[01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:32.520]   is negative in terms of life expectancy
[01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:34.340]   and certainly is not good
[01:02:34.340 --> 01:02:37.180]   for a great number of different systems
[01:02:37.180 --> 01:02:38.640]   within the brain and body.
[01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:41.320]   But I think the study sometimes is used
[01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:43.460]   to highlight the wrong conclusion,
[01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:47.440]   which is that sunlight itself is extending lifespan.
[01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:49.940]   I think that that very simple conclusion
[01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:51.680]   can be taken too far
[01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:53.920]   and can start to negate
[01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:55.880]   some of the equally important messages
[01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:58.040]   about excessive sunlight exposure
[01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:00.700]   causing certain problems as it relates to skin cancers,
[01:03:00.700 --> 01:03:02.160]   which we talked about earlier,
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:03.960]   as it relates to things that you can do
[01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:05.900]   in order to offset some of that risk
[01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:07.840]   with, if I were to suggest,
[01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:09.700]   a physical barrier if you need it,
[01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:11.020]   a chemical-based sunscreen
[01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:12.840]   if you choose to use sunscreen.
[01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:15.080]   And of course, that's an independent choice
[01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:17.560]   that each of us have to make for ourselves.
[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:20.160]   Okay, let's talk about youthfulness of skin
[01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:23.480]   or the appearance of youthfulness in skin.
[01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:24.600]   Before I did this episode,
[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:26.360]   I put the call out on social media
[01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:29.040]   for questions about skin and skin health.
[01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:32.120]   And I must say that the vast majority of questions
[01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:33.880]   related to this topic.
[01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:35.280]   And it's a very interesting one
[01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:37.520]   because it relates to a lot of decisions
[01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:40.500]   that people are making about what to do,
[01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:43.240]   what to buy or not buy as the case may be.
[01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:46.080]   And it is an enormous,
[01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:48.920]   probably hundreds of billions of dollars industry,
[01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:51.320]   if not trillion dollar industry over time,
[01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:55.220]   this business of devices, products and procedures
[01:03:55.220 --> 01:03:57.620]   to try and reverse aging
[01:03:57.620 --> 01:03:59.880]   or the appearance of aging in skin,
[01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:02.040]   or even create de novo,
[01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:05.000]   new synthesis of collagen in skin
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.720]   and other things to make skin look more youthful.
[01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:10.540]   Okay, so if we step back from this whole area,
[01:04:10.540 --> 01:04:11.500]   we have to ask ourselves,
[01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:16.220]   what do we know for sure about what makes skin look youthful
[01:04:16.220 --> 01:04:18.960]   and what can be done to make skin look more youthful?
[01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:20.980]   And to understand the answers to those questions,
[01:04:20.980 --> 01:04:22.020]   we simply have to go back
[01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:24.460]   to the beginning of today's discussion for just a moment.
[01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:26.700]   Remember that we have the epidermal layer of skin,
[01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:28.100]   we have the dermal layer of skin,
[01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:30.420]   we have the vasculature, the blood vessels and capillaries,
[01:04:30.420 --> 01:04:32.620]   you have the nerve inputs there,
[01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:35.180]   and you have a bunch of different cell types in there,
[01:04:35.180 --> 01:04:36.700]   the keratinocytes.
[01:04:36.700 --> 01:04:39.820]   You have different proteins within those cells
[01:04:39.820 --> 01:04:43.420]   like collagen, elastin that over time can, yes,
[01:04:43.420 --> 01:04:46.300]   be mutated by things like UV rays from the sun,
[01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:48.980]   but that over time tend to lose their elasticity,
[01:04:48.980 --> 01:04:50.900]   which leads to wrinkles and sagging skin.
[01:04:50.900 --> 01:04:54.740]   You also have this issue of hydration of the skin, right?
[01:04:54.740 --> 01:04:57.300]   Skin has a lot of watery components within it,
[01:04:57.300 --> 01:04:59.020]   actual water within it.
[01:04:59.020 --> 01:05:01.580]   And those watery components are what give it
[01:05:01.580 --> 01:05:04.960]   its kind of plump, moist look, smooth look,
[01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:08.720]   as opposed to desiccated, sagging, wrinkled look,
[01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:09.940]   to speak in extremes.
[01:05:09.940 --> 01:05:10.900]   And there are hundreds,
[01:05:10.900 --> 01:05:13.820]   if not thousands of different chemicals out there
[01:05:13.820 --> 01:05:16.820]   that dermatologists, as well as cosmetic surgeons,
[01:05:16.820 --> 01:05:20.480]   as well as just, frankly, manufacturers of products,
[01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:22.060]   assert are going to be good for skin.
[01:05:22.060 --> 01:05:24.780]   So let's talk about where there is a lot of evidence
[01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:26.580]   for certain things that you can do
[01:05:26.580 --> 01:05:29.300]   if your goal is to increase the youthfulness
[01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:31.140]   or the appearance of youthfulness in your skin.
[01:05:31.140 --> 01:05:34.180]   And one of the main ones is collagen itself.
[01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:35.520]   And now I have to admit,
[01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:37.700]   I was very surprised when I looked at this literature,
[01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:39.940]   but I was positively surprised.
[01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:41.220]   Here's why.
[01:05:41.220 --> 01:05:43.260]   As you know, there are various macronutrients
[01:05:43.260 --> 01:05:44.100]   present in foods.
[01:05:44.100 --> 01:05:46.500]   You can have proteins, fats, and carbohydrates.
[01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:50.860]   When we ingest proteins, such as beef, chicken, fish, eggs,
[01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:52.700]   as well as some vegan sources of proteins,
[01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:57.100]   like beans, or lentils, or tofu, or things of that sort,
[01:05:57.100 --> 01:05:59.180]   they contain different amounts
[01:05:59.180 --> 01:06:01.380]   of different essential amino acids.
[01:06:01.380 --> 01:06:04.460]   And those essential amino acids and other amino acids
[01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:08.020]   are used as the building blocks for proteins in our muscles,
[01:06:08.020 --> 01:06:09.340]   in our tendons,
[01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:12.220]   in essentially all the organ systems of our body.
[01:06:12.220 --> 01:06:15.740]   The lipids are also used for cell membranes, et cetera, okay?
[01:06:15.740 --> 01:06:18.400]   This has been discussed various times on this podcast before,
[01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:22.860]   people like Dr. Lane Norton, Dr. Gabrielle Lyon, and others.
[01:06:22.860 --> 01:06:24.420]   It's well-established
[01:06:24.420 --> 01:06:27.260]   that when these proteins are broken down in the gut,
[01:06:27.260 --> 01:06:28.940]   some of those amino acids go
[01:06:28.940 --> 01:06:31.940]   and serve for the purpose of tissue repair.
[01:06:31.940 --> 01:06:34.060]   Others are for the purpose of other things.
[01:06:34.060 --> 01:06:36.140]   What most people in the field of nutrition agree upon,
[01:06:36.140 --> 01:06:37.340]   and what certainly I believe,
[01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:41.360]   is that if you were to, say, eat a little bit of liver,
[01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:43.500]   right, you might have a little bit of cooked liver,
[01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:45.120]   or a little bit of skeletal muscle
[01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:47.180]   in the form of like a steak,
[01:06:47.180 --> 01:06:50.260]   that there's no selective trafficking of the amino acids
[01:06:50.260 --> 01:06:53.060]   that are broken down from the liver that you eat
[01:06:53.060 --> 01:06:54.540]   to your liver, right?
[01:06:54.540 --> 01:06:57.340]   So when you hear that eating liver supports your liver,
[01:06:57.340 --> 01:07:02.140]   it may do that by the broad process of certain amino acids
[01:07:02.140 --> 01:07:04.140]   and vitamins and lipids, et cetera,
[01:07:04.140 --> 01:07:06.660]   serving your liver and other organ
[01:07:06.660 --> 01:07:08.020]   and tissue systems of the body,
[01:07:08.020 --> 01:07:10.420]   but not selectively your liver.
[01:07:10.420 --> 01:07:12.300]   However, when we talk about collagen,
[01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:15.580]   this protein that forms one of the most essential aspects
[01:07:15.580 --> 01:07:19.020]   of what makes our skin what it is, which is elastic,
[01:07:19.020 --> 01:07:22.500]   and to have some tensile strength where you can push on it,
[01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:25.160]   it returns to its original position,
[01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:27.000]   especially if it's well-hydrated.
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.360]   And makes our skin very youthful in appearance
[01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:31.840]   when we're young, and then as it degrades when we get old,
[01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:33.100]   makes it look less youthful,
[01:07:33.100 --> 01:07:35.240]   wrinkles and sagging and so forth.
[01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:37.700]   Well, then why would eating collagen protein,
[01:07:37.700 --> 01:07:39.580]   which can come from any number of different sources,
[01:07:39.580 --> 01:07:40.920]   it can come from fish sources,
[01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:43.700]   it can come from, believe it or not, animal health sources,
[01:07:43.700 --> 01:07:45.260]   can come from any number of different sources,
[01:07:45.260 --> 01:07:46.460]   tendon, et cetera,
[01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:51.180]   why would ingesting collagen be selectively trafficked
[01:07:51.180 --> 01:07:54.180]   to the collagen in our skin, right?
[01:07:54.180 --> 01:07:56.060]   That doesn't square with everything we know,
[01:07:56.060 --> 01:07:57.940]   and yet, when you look at studies,
[01:07:57.940 --> 01:07:59.760]   including meta-analyses of studies
[01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:02.360]   where people supplement with collagen powders,
[01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:05.000]   and these powders typically come from fish or tendon,
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.600]   any number of different sources,
[01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:09.280]   when people do this,
[01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:11.840]   and then measures are taken as to skin appearance,
[01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:13.680]   skin elasticity, there are a bunch of measures
[01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:16.120]   that can be done in humans in the laboratory to do this,
[01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:17.320]   you often will find studies
[01:08:17.320 --> 01:08:20.140]   that show statistically significant improvements
[01:08:20.140 --> 01:08:22.800]   in collagen composition and skin appearance,
[01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:24.940]   and even the appearance of reduction in wrinkles
[01:08:24.940 --> 01:08:26.000]   and so forth.
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.860]   So this is an interesting exception
[01:08:27.860 --> 01:08:30.180]   where the ingestion of a particular protein
[01:08:30.180 --> 01:08:33.460]   that naturally exists in abundance in certain tissues,
[01:08:33.460 --> 01:08:35.440]   such as skin, but also other tissues,
[01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:38.080]   like tendon, ligaments, et cetera,
[01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:42.200]   seems to be assisting in either the repair
[01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:44.600]   and rejuvenation of collagen,
[01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:48.280]   or perhaps some other aspect of collagen synthesis
[01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:51.600]   that leads to improvements in collagen composition
[01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:53.880]   and the appearance of skin in humans.
[01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:54.880]   That's very interesting,
[01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:56.960]   and the study that I find particularly interesting
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:58.900]   is one that I'll link to in the show note captions,
[01:08:58.900 --> 01:09:00.160]   it's entitled, quote,
[01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:02.800]   "Exploring the Impact of Hydrolyzed Collagen
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:05.000]   "Oral Supplementation on Skin Rejuvenation,
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.520]   "A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis."
[01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:10.420]   And the basic takeaway of this and other meta-analyses,
[01:09:10.420 --> 01:09:13.240]   and the studies within this meta-analyses,
[01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:14.560]   is that when people supplement
[01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:19.280]   with anywhere from five to 15 grams, okay, grams,
[01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:22.360]   of hydrolyzed collagen per day,
[01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:24.640]   in particular in combination with vitamin C,
[01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:26.640]   it doesn't have to be a lot of vitamin C,
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:29.080]   that one can observe, okay, not always,
[01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:31.960]   but can observe some visible improvements
[01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:34.840]   in skin composition, meaning less wrinkles,
[01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:37.080]   even some reversal of wrinkles,
[01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:39.880]   less skin sagging, more youthful appearance,
[01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:44.800]   more kind of, let's just call it rebound elasticity
[01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:45.640]   of the skin.
[01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:47.400]   I realize that's not the appropriate technical term,
[01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:49.520]   but the ability of a skin to bounce back
[01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:52.360]   from an indentation when you push down on it,
[01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:55.120]   as opposed to saying down or sagging.
[01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:57.440]   So some pretty impressive results when one considers
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:58.660]   that what people are basically doing here
[01:09:58.660 --> 01:10:00.880]   is just mixing up some hydrolyzed collagen protein,
[01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:03.960]   and then drinking that down once per day or so.
[01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:06.600]   Now, that is not to say that you have to supplement
[01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:08.160]   with hydrolyzed collagen, why?
[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:11.520]   Well, collagen is also present in various foods.
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:15.840]   So for instance, drinking bone broth, beef bone broth,
[01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:17.960]   chicken bone broth is a rich source of collagen.
[01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:20.960]   You can go online and simply look up, just by web search,
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:23.880]   you can just say what foods contain high levels of collagen,
[01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:25.320]   and you'll get a list of things back there.
[01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:27.920]   Hopefully a few of those are not just palatable to you,
[01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:28.800]   but you actually like,
[01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:30.920]   and you can start to include those in your daily diet,
[01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:34.300]   or you could supplement with hydrolyzed collagen protein.
[01:10:34.300 --> 01:10:36.480]   There are any number of different sources for these.
[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:39.740]   It's interesting that while indeed I don't believe,
[01:10:39.740 --> 01:10:41.320]   and there is frankly zero evidence
[01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:43.840]   for selective trafficking of amino acids
[01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:46.240]   arising from a particular organ source
[01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:48.520]   to that particular organ when you ingest it,
[01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:51.960]   it is interesting that consuming hydrolyzed collagen
[01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:52.960]   in the form of a supplement
[01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:56.940]   or deriving it from foods like bone broth, et cetera,
[01:10:56.940 --> 01:10:59.860]   does seem to be able to improve collagen synthesis
[01:10:59.860 --> 01:11:02.720]   or the appearance of skin, making it more youthful.
[01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:04.040]   For those of you that are interested
[01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:05.840]   in ingesting collagen peptides
[01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:09.380]   as a way to improve the youthfulness of your skin,
[01:11:09.380 --> 01:11:12.580]   should mention that the dosages there come in a range,
[01:11:12.580 --> 01:11:14.000]   depending on the studies that you've looked at.
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:15.940]   And the dermatologist that I spoke to said,
[01:11:15.940 --> 01:11:19.020]   if one decides to go down this route of supplementing
[01:11:19.020 --> 01:11:21.000]   or getting collagen from food sources,
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:24.420]   you want to aim for anywhere from 15 grams to 30 grams
[01:11:24.420 --> 01:11:26.600]   of collagen peptides per day, okay?
[01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:28.540]   That's a bit higher than what was used
[01:11:28.540 --> 01:11:30.100]   in a number of studies,
[01:11:30.100 --> 01:11:32.580]   but you'll find studies that use 30 grams.
[01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:35.420]   And that that whole process can be augmented,
[01:11:35.420 --> 01:11:39.700]   can be improved through ingestion of 500
[01:11:39.700 --> 01:11:42.380]   to a thousand milligrams of vitamin C as well.
[01:11:42.380 --> 01:11:44.680]   But check the label on those collagen peptides
[01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:45.860]   that you might be supplementing with,
[01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:47.720]   'cause oftentimes they already include
[01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:50.500]   that 500 to a thousand milligrams of vitamin C.
[01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:53.180]   I should also mention that the dermatologist I spoke to
[01:11:53.180 --> 01:11:55.660]   said that they like collagen protein supplementation,
[01:11:55.660 --> 01:11:58.100]   not just for the reasons discussed up until now,
[01:11:58.100 --> 01:11:59.920]   but that they liked them for a number of other reasons,
[01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:02.540]   such as the potential anti-inflammatory effects
[01:12:02.540 --> 01:12:03.860]   of collagen proteins.
[01:12:03.860 --> 01:12:05.820]   To be honest, I don't know what the exact mechanism
[01:12:05.820 --> 01:12:06.800]   of that is.
[01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:08.780]   Maybe if you get a certain protein threshold,
[01:12:08.780 --> 01:12:09.860]   the inflammation is down.
[01:12:09.860 --> 01:12:11.780]   But anyway, that's still cryptic to me.
[01:12:11.780 --> 01:12:13.580]   But in any case, they did describe
[01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:14.940]   some of the potential mechanisms
[01:12:14.940 --> 01:12:18.020]   by which collagen ingestion can do its thing
[01:12:18.020 --> 01:12:19.820]   in terms of improving youthfulness.
[01:12:19.820 --> 01:12:22.300]   It's broken down in the blood into dipeptides
[01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:25.440]   and tripeptides, which then are used
[01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:27.300]   within the collagen itself of the skin.
[01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:29.020]   This is the hypothesis.
[01:12:29.020 --> 01:12:32.500]   And that it can increase the chemotaxis,
[01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:33.940]   the mobility of fibroblasts,
[01:12:33.940 --> 01:12:36.620]   which make up some of the skin tissue
[01:12:36.620 --> 01:12:40.260]   and give rise to the appearance of more youthful skin.
[01:12:40.260 --> 01:12:41.840]   There's also evidence that ingestion
[01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:46.360]   of hydrolyzed collagen peptides can improve the elasticity
[01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:48.400]   of the skin barrier on the outside, right?
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:49.960]   Make it look nice and taut.
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:51.120]   If I guess we say nice,
[01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:53.520]   we're sort of passing subjective readout on this.
[01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:56.040]   Make it appear taut through the increase
[01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:58.040]   of certain proteins unrelated to collagen,
[01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:00.320]   such as filigrenes, elastins, et cetera.
[01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:02.240]   What about other peptides?
[01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:04.640]   Okay, so this is a big topic nowadays,
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:06.240]   especially in the online communities.
[01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:09.440]   I did an entire episode of this podcast about peptides.
[01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:12.080]   Keep in mind that insulin is a peptide.
[01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:15.160]   Ozempic, what is essentially an agonist
[01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:17.480]   for glucagon-like peptide one.
[01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:20.720]   This is a very popular prescription drug now
[01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:22.360]   for the treatment of obesity
[01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:25.040]   and for the treatment of diabetes.
[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:27.720]   There are lots of things that qualify as peptides.
[01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:30.400]   A peptide is simply a small chain of amino acids.
[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:33.000]   A polypeptide is a bit longer chain of amino acids.
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.600]   And then proteins are made up of amino acids.
[01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:37.600]   Okay, so when we say peptides,
[01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:38.820]   that means many, many things.
[01:13:38.820 --> 01:13:41.840]   But these days, when you hear about quote-unquote peptides,
[01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:43.800]   especially in online communities,
[01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:47.720]   generally people are referring to exogenously given, okay?
[01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:52.040]   So pills, ointments, or more typically injections
[01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:54.520]   of peptides that are designed to achieve
[01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:58.000]   some specific biological or physiological outcome.
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:59.600]   And one of the more common of these peptides
[01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:01.560]   being used nowadays is one that I've talked about before
[01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:05.700]   called BPC-157, Body Protection Compound 157,
[01:14:05.700 --> 01:14:08.080]   which is essentially a synthetic version
[01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:11.260]   of something found in gastric juice in all of us.
[01:14:11.260 --> 01:14:14.540]   It's known that certain peptides within the gut
[01:14:14.540 --> 01:14:16.740]   that BPC-157 is known to mimic,
[01:14:16.740 --> 01:14:18.280]   or it actually is a synthetic version
[01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:20.980]   of that exact sequence or a portion of that sequence,
[01:14:20.980 --> 01:14:24.040]   can assist in tissue and wound repair of different kinds.
[01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:26.900]   Tendon, anything involving fibroblasts,
[01:14:26.900 --> 01:14:31.180]   all of that has been well-demonstrated in vitro in a dish,
[01:14:31.180 --> 01:14:32.740]   okay, so not in vivo,
[01:14:32.740 --> 01:14:35.460]   as well as in vivo in certain cases,
[01:14:35.460 --> 01:14:37.040]   but only in animal models.
[01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:38.860]   To my knowledge, there's only one study,
[01:14:38.860 --> 01:14:42.020]   and frankly, it's not a very good study at all,
[01:14:42.020 --> 01:14:43.820]   on BPC-157 in humans,
[01:14:43.820 --> 01:14:46.420]   and yet a lot of people are taking BPC-157
[01:14:46.420 --> 01:14:49.540]   either orally in the form of a capsule or pill,
[01:14:49.540 --> 01:14:51.440]   or more typically injecting it.
[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:53.700]   What does it do, or what does it likely do in humans?
[01:14:53.700 --> 01:14:56.500]   We know from animal models that BPC-157
[01:14:56.500 --> 01:14:58.020]   increases angiogenesis,
[01:14:58.020 --> 01:14:59.900]   the growth of capillaries and blood vessels.
[01:14:59.900 --> 01:15:00.940]   We know this.
[01:15:00.940 --> 01:15:02.340]   It can accelerate wound healing
[01:15:02.340 --> 01:15:05.940]   by virtue of increasing fibroblast motility.
[01:15:05.940 --> 01:15:10.200]   For this reason, it's used post-injury in sports.
[01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:13.240]   It's used by people who want to build more muscle.
[01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:14.740]   It's used by endurance athletes.
[01:15:14.740 --> 01:15:16.880]   It's used for cosmetic purposes.
[01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:19.800]   Anytime people are using BPC-157,
[01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:21.580]   for any of those purposes,
[01:15:21.580 --> 01:15:24.000]   it's likely that they're using it in part
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.400]   to increase the blood flow that's available
[01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:29.600]   to a given tissue and the repair of that tissue.
[01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:31.640]   Now, again, I do want to caution people
[01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:33.640]   that there is very little,
[01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:35.280]   basically no evidence in humans
[01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:37.460]   besides the anecdotal evidence
[01:15:37.460 --> 01:15:39.280]   that people say they healed faster.
[01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:40.160]   What I do know is that
[01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:42.320]   anytime you get vascularization of tissue,
[01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:44.960]   you're going to get improved blood flow,
[01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:46.980]   so it all makes sense mechanistically.
[01:15:46.980 --> 01:15:50.400]   I also know that vascularization due to BPC-157,
[01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:53.520]   even if it's injected locally into a given tissue,
[01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:55.800]   is likely to occur globally throughout the body.
[01:15:55.800 --> 01:15:58.240]   This is why some people taking oral BPC-157
[01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:00.280]   or injecting it just subcutaneously
[01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:02.200]   at the level of their stomach,
[01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:04.400]   a little bit under the skin at the level of their stomach,
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:07.020]   report faster wound healing even in a distal limb
[01:16:07.020 --> 01:16:09.280]   or like a hand or a nerve injury in their foot
[01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:11.000]   or something like that.
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.880]   That also tells us that there's going to be
[01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:15.560]   increased vascularization of other tissues,
[01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:19.720]   such as skin, such as tumors, if tumors exist.
[01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:20.960]   So you need to be very careful.
[01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:22.880]   I need to say that upfront as a cautionary note
[01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:25.240]   because it is very clear that many people
[01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:28.080]   are starting to either inject BPC-157
[01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:30.480]   or apply it in the form of a topical cream
[01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:33.640]   in effort to get more vascularization of skin
[01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:36.080]   in order to make that skin appear more youthful.
[01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:37.480]   And more and more products are out there
[01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:39.240]   that contain BPC-157.
[01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:42.200]   I can't in good conscious recommend those products.
[01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:44.720]   I can only offer to you the likely mechanism
[01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:47.160]   by which they work if they work,
[01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:50.160]   and also offer you the caveat that it is unclear
[01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:54.200]   that BPC-157 can go transdermally if it's applied topically.
[01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:57.320]   So if you put it on a, say, wrinkly portion of your face,
[01:16:57.320 --> 01:16:58.440]   so like I've got crow's feet.
[01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:01.760]   Crow's feet come from either aging, smiling, or both.
[01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:03.360]   You know, the crow's feet are the kind of wrinkles
[01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:05.260]   that extend out the corners of your eyes when you smile,
[01:17:05.260 --> 01:17:06.960]   or for me, 'cause I'm, you know, 48,
[01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:09.560]   you know, and probably do that even when I don't smile.
[01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:12.040]   The logic would be that if you take a cream containing
[01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:14.340]   BPC-157 and you put it on there,
[01:17:14.340 --> 01:17:17.000]   that you'll get increased vascularization of that area,
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.580]   delivery of more growth factors and nutrients,
[01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:21.800]   and those wrinkles will either be halted
[01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:25.480]   in their aging progression or that they will reverse.
[01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:26.480]   That's the logic.
[01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:28.640]   To my knowledge, there are no clinical studies,
[01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:29.840]   and I'd love to know from you,
[01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:32.060]   if you've tried these products,
[01:17:32.060 --> 01:17:33.720]   please put your experience of those
[01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:35.720]   in the comments on YouTube,
[01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:37.160]   so we can get a sense of whether or not
[01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:39.480]   people are having good results with this.
[01:17:39.480 --> 01:17:40.880]   That, of course, is not a controlled study,
[01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:42.440]   but I'm very curious as to know.
[01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:45.360]   Many of the products that contain BPC-157, by the way,
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:47.120]   also contain copper.
[01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:48.200]   Copper is a trace mineral.
[01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:49.960]   It's found in your diet.
[01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:52.040]   There is some evidence that copper is important
[01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:54.780]   for some of the collagen and other elements
[01:17:54.780 --> 01:17:57.080]   of skin synthesis pathways.
[01:17:57.080 --> 01:18:00.320]   And so the mechanistic logic and the biochemical logic
[01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:01.320]   is there on paper.
[01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:05.600]   However, it's also clear that ingesting too much copper
[01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:07.580]   can induce an inflammatory response
[01:18:07.580 --> 01:18:10.460]   and would lead to the exact opposite desired effect
[01:18:10.460 --> 01:18:13.920]   that people who are using copper
[01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:17.200]   and usually copper BPC-containing products
[01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:18.040]   are taking them for,
[01:18:18.040 --> 01:18:21.100]   which is to halt or reverse the appearance
[01:18:21.100 --> 01:18:22.320]   of aging in their skin.
[01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:24.560]   Why am I going through this whole gymnastics
[01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:26.680]   of, you know, BPC-157 and copper?
[01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:29.760]   Well, because nowadays many, many products
[01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:33.280]   are starting to include "peptides" for skin rejuvenation.
[01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:37.640]   And most often those peptides are of the copper variety,
[01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:40.300]   of the BPC-157 variety,
[01:18:40.300 --> 01:18:43.280]   and oftentimes also with things
[01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:46.240]   related to collagen synthesis, sometimes collagen directly.
[01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:49.960]   So you'll find oral products that one takes by pill form
[01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:54.960]   that are BPC-157, copper, and collagen,
[01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:57.560]   or things that promote synthesis of collagen.
[01:18:57.560 --> 01:18:59.760]   You'll find ointments that are pure BPC-157,
[01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:01.680]   still unclear if those go transdermal.
[01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:05.280]   Okay, so this is still a very, very young science.
[01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:07.920]   And most of this is not being explored
[01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:09.480]   in randomized control trials.
[01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:10.960]   However, I know some of you out there
[01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:12.360]   are pretty experimental.
[01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:14.920]   You like experimenting with this kind of stuff.
[01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:16.800]   You like hearing what's working for other people.
[01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:18.300]   Here's what I suggest.
[01:19:18.300 --> 01:19:23.300]   If a sunscreen or a lotion or a pill or an injection
[01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:26.700]   is asserted to contain peptides
[01:19:26.700 --> 01:19:28.120]   to help with skin rejuvenation,
[01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:29.000]   make sure you look and see
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.220]   which specific peptides are included.
[01:19:31.220 --> 01:19:33.520]   Know the risks associated with BPC-157.
[01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:36.340]   It's uncertain risk about acceleration of tumor growth,
[01:19:36.340 --> 01:19:38.880]   but the mechanistic logic is just as strong for that
[01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:41.980]   with BPC-157 as it is for BPC-157,
[01:19:41.980 --> 01:19:44.280]   encouraging vascularization of any other tissue,
[01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:47.320]   muscle, tendon, ligament, or skin for that matter.
[01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:48.360]   So I'm not telling you what to do,
[01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:49.600]   just know what you're doing
[01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:52.720]   and understand the likely mechanisms behind it
[01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:55.400]   in the absence of any of these randomized control trials.
[01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:58.240]   I will say in service to making sure that your diet
[01:19:58.240 --> 01:20:01.880]   and or supplementation includes enough trace mineral copper.
[01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:05.000]   Copper has been shown to play a key role in DNA repair,
[01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.960]   which is a critical component of the turnover of collagen
[01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:09.800]   and other proteins in skin.
[01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:11.520]   It has been shown to reduce
[01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:13.280]   so-called reactive oxygen species.
[01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:15.760]   So it serves as a so-called antioxidant
[01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:19.020]   and this relates to what I just said, reduced inflammation,
[01:20:19.020 --> 01:20:20.940]   but too much copper is a problem.
[01:20:20.940 --> 01:20:22.640]   So I wouldn't run out and start supplementing
[01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:23.900]   with excessive amounts of copper.
[01:20:23.900 --> 01:20:25.080]   Please don't do that.
[01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:25.920]   But you want to make sure
[01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:28.160]   that you're getting sufficient amounts of copper
[01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:30.060]   from your diet and you can simply look up online
[01:20:30.060 --> 01:20:32.400]   what sufficient amounts of copper are
[01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:33.640]   given it's a trace mineral.
[01:20:33.640 --> 01:20:36.320]   And it's very likely that if you ingest any kind
[01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:40.080]   of supplement that is a multivitamin mineral supplement
[01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:41.720]   or a foundational nutrition supplement,
[01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:43.480]   that includes at least some copper.
[01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:45.880]   So it's likely that you're sort of quote unquote topped off
[01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:47.800]   in terms of the amount of copper that you need,
[01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:50.400]   but very unlikely to be excessive amounts of copper.
[01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:53.040]   But if you start supplementing with copper beyond that,
[01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:55.520]   again, you can induce an inflammatory response.
[01:20:55.520 --> 01:20:59.160]   So it's a dosage kind of middle ground issue there.
[01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:00.580]   You don't want your copper too low.
[01:21:00.580 --> 01:21:01.720]   You don't want your copper too high.
[01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:03.320]   You want it right there in the middle.
[01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:04.320]   Okay, as I mentioned before,
[01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:06.300]   we will talk about other components of food
[01:21:06.300 --> 01:21:08.100]   that are great for skin health.
[01:21:08.100 --> 01:21:10.760]   And we will also talk about components of certain foods
[01:21:10.760 --> 01:21:13.680]   like advanced glycation end products.
[01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:14.760]   I don't know if you've heard of those before,
[01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:16.880]   but very interesting, not good stuff
[01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:18.240]   that you want to avoid if you can,
[01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:20.320]   especially if your concern is youthful looking skin
[01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:23.500]   and healthy skin and frankly health overall.
[01:21:23.500 --> 01:21:24.720]   But before we do that,
[01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:26.520]   I think it's worth paying attention to a few things
[01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:28.400]   that you can potentially take
[01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:30.760]   that can really improve the youthfulness of your skin
[01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:33.580]   for which there is excellent science to support it.
[01:21:33.580 --> 01:21:37.160]   Okay, so when I spoke to board certified dermatologists
[01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:39.520]   who trained at excellent institutions,
[01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:43.000]   what people can do to improve the youthfulness
[01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.640]   or the appearance of youthfulness in their skin
[01:21:45.640 --> 01:21:48.720]   and that there specifically be peer reviewed studies
[01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:50.420]   to support their statements.
[01:21:50.420 --> 01:21:53.120]   They mentioned hydrolyzed collagen protein
[01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:54.320]   in combination with vitamin C.
[01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:55.960]   We talked about that earlier.
[01:21:55.960 --> 01:21:57.440]   They mentioned a bunch of do's and don'ts
[01:21:57.440 --> 01:22:00.160]   as it relates to sun exposure and nutrition, et cetera,
[01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:01.060]   some of which we've covered,
[01:22:01.060 --> 01:22:03.960]   some of which we are yet to cover, but will soon.
[01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:08.200]   And they mentioned supplementing with niacinamide.
[01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:11.240]   Niacinamide is a form of vitamin B3.
[01:22:11.240 --> 01:22:14.120]   It is also sometimes referred to as nicotinamide.
[01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:17.080]   And I was told that when taken at twice per day
[01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:19.200]   at a dosage of 500 milligrams per dose
[01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:22.960]   for a total of one gram or 1000 milligrams per day,
[01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:25.720]   that niacinamide supplementation
[01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:28.360]   can increase the production of ceramides,
[01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:32.180]   which relate to the lipids in skin
[01:22:32.180 --> 01:22:34.400]   that improve the moisture in skin.
[01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:37.560]   And by the way, moisture in skin is a key component
[01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:39.900]   of the youthfulness or plump appearance of that skin.
[01:22:39.900 --> 01:22:40.740]   And when I say plump,
[01:22:40.740 --> 01:22:43.440]   I don't necessarily mean outwardly rounded plump.
[01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:45.480]   I mean, the fact that the skin looks
[01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:47.400]   like the outermost layer of the skin,
[01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:48.920]   which you now know as the epidermis,
[01:22:48.920 --> 01:22:51.440]   is kind of taut and the skin looks hydrated
[01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:53.840]   and smooth at the level of its outer appearance,
[01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:58.160]   all of that is improved by niacinamide supplementation,
[01:22:58.160 --> 01:22:59.940]   but that the supplementation has to be carried out
[01:22:59.940 --> 01:23:02.060]   for three to six months or more
[01:23:02.060 --> 01:23:04.240]   before that effect is noticed.
[01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:06.360]   Now, the origin of the niacinamide effect
[01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:07.960]   on the youthfulness of skin
[01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:09.920]   could also be related to the fact that there's evidence
[01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:11.280]   that niacinamide supplementation
[01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:13.720]   can reduce inflammation of skin overall.
[01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:14.560]   We haven't talked so much
[01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:16.380]   about the immune skin relationship,
[01:23:16.380 --> 01:23:18.600]   although as I alluded to at the beginning of the episode,
[01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:20.400]   this is a key relationship.
[01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:25.020]   But for those of you suffering from rosacea, from acne,
[01:23:25.020 --> 01:23:27.320]   so rosacea being a reddening of the skin,
[01:23:27.320 --> 01:23:28.660]   we're going to talk more about it later
[01:23:28.660 --> 01:23:30.240]   and specific things that can be done for it.
[01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:33.120]   Acne almost always involves some reddening,
[01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:36.080]   often painful reddening of specific pox on the skin,
[01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:38.140]   sometimes even the appearance of, you know,
[01:23:38.140 --> 01:23:40.800]   pus-filled bumps, this sort of thing,
[01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:43.740]   that niacinamide supplementation may also assist there
[01:23:43.740 --> 01:23:45.560]   because of the reduction in inflammation.
[01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:47.280]   And we'll talk all about the relationship
[01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:49.320]   between inflammation and acne.
[01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:51.640]   Regardless of whether or not you suffer from rosacea or acne
[01:23:51.640 --> 01:23:53.500]   or not at all,
[01:23:53.500 --> 01:23:56.660]   that niacinamide supplementation may benefit you.
[01:23:56.660 --> 01:23:58.640]   Also because niacinamide supplementation
[01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:01.360]   appears to balance the level of oil production in the skin,
[01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:02.600]   you need oil in the skin,
[01:24:02.600 --> 01:24:05.560]   you need oil down in those pores, but not too much.
[01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:07.080]   And that it can definitely help reduce
[01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:08.720]   the appearance of clogged pores.
[01:24:08.720 --> 01:24:11.960]   And if you're concerned about pores that appear too large,
[01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:15.120]   this typically happens in the face, around the nose,
[01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:16.000]   on the upper cheeks,
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:17.760]   although other regions of the body as well,
[01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:20.840]   niacinamide supplementation may assist with that as well.
[01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:22.080]   There's also a number of people out there
[01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:24.680]   that are concerned with specific spots
[01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:26.860]   that they see as hyperpigmented spots.
[01:24:26.860 --> 01:24:28.980]   So regardless of whether or not overall your skin
[01:24:28.980 --> 01:24:31.440]   is very light or very heavily pigmented,
[01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:34.880]   supplementation with niacinamide
[01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:37.800]   can reduce the appearance of accumulation
[01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:40.060]   and maybe even the actual accumulation
[01:24:40.060 --> 01:24:41.400]   of melanin in a particular spot,
[01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:43.080]   so-called dark pigmented spots,
[01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:44.640]   that some people decide that they don't want
[01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:46.760]   for whatever reason, usually just cosmetic reasons.
[01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:49.180]   Although there may be reasons why hyperpigmentation
[01:24:49.180 --> 01:24:51.360]   in a given area could relate to skin cancers.
[01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:52.800]   We talked about that earlier.
[01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:54.700]   Another reason to go get not just your moles,
[01:24:54.700 --> 01:24:56.960]   but all of your skin checked at least once per year.
[01:24:56.960 --> 01:24:58.960]   Now, if you decide to supplement with niacinamide,
[01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:01.240]   you have the option of either taking that 1,000 milligrams
[01:25:01.240 --> 01:25:03.900]   and two 500 milligram dosages per day.
[01:25:03.900 --> 01:25:06.280]   You also have the option of using any number
[01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:09.440]   of different topical niacinamide ointments
[01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:11.440]   or serums that exist out there.
[01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:13.080]   Keep in mind that many skincare products
[01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:15.800]   already contain niacinamide, so check the label.
[01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:19.640]   And there, the dermatologists tell me that to be effective,
[01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:22.480]   the niacinamide needs to be present at at least a two
[01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:24.440]   and as high as 10% concentration
[01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:26.660]   within those ointments or serums.
[01:25:26.660 --> 01:25:28.520]   Keep in mind that many serums and ointments
[01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:30.920]   also contain what's called hyaluronic acid.
[01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:34.640]   Hyaluronic acid is a natural component of the skin
[01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:37.120]   that provides a physical substrate for holding in water,
[01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:38.400]   so moisture within the skin.
[01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:39.880]   It does a bunch of other important things too
[01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:42.460]   within the extracellular matrix and elsewhere,
[01:25:42.460 --> 01:25:44.480]   the regions between the cells that is.
[01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:47.240]   And supplementation with hyaluronic acid
[01:25:47.240 --> 01:25:49.440]   or ointments or serums that contain hyaluronic acid
[01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:51.520]   and niacinamide are pretty common out there
[01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:54.600]   because of the already stated effects of niacinamide
[01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:56.440]   and the fact that hyaluronic acid can serve
[01:25:56.440 --> 01:25:57.600]   as what's called a humectant,
[01:25:57.600 --> 01:26:01.280]   something that serves to sort of barrier in moisture
[01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:02.800]   at the level of the skin, okay?
[01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:06.520]   So it gives that kind of plumping moist look of skin
[01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:08.720]   that's characteristic of youthful skin
[01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:10.600]   as opposed to aged skin.
[01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:13.360]   The dermatologists and the cosmetic surgeons
[01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:16.480]   that work on faces that I spoke to,
[01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:18.840]   I told you I consulted with a fairly large
[01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:20.840]   and diversified group of folks
[01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:22.320]   in preparation for this episode,
[01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:25.680]   all agreed that supplementation with collagen, vitamin C,
[01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:28.600]   niacinamide and hyaluronic acid
[01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:31.040]   was something that they suggest to their patients.
[01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:31.880]   The other supplement,
[01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:35.720]   well, actually it's a prescription treatment most often
[01:26:35.720 --> 01:26:37.480]   that dermatologists recommend
[01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:40.120]   if the goal is youthful appearing skin,
[01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:43.160]   are things within the so-called retinoid pathway
[01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:44.640]   such as retinol, okay?
[01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:46.560]   Many of you have perhaps heard of this
[01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:50.080]   and it's a whole story related to the relationship
[01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:53.200]   between vitamin A and skin.
[01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:55.620]   Okay, so tretinoin is the common name for it,
[01:26:55.620 --> 01:26:58.400]   although some of you may know it as retin-A
[01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:01.760]   and prescription drugs that are similar to that
[01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:05.360]   are basically derivatives of vitamin A, why?
[01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:07.400]   Why are these used for skincare?
[01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:09.360]   Why are they used to increase the youthfulness of skin?
[01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:11.760]   Well, vitamin A gets into skin cells
[01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:14.440]   and is converted into something called retinaldehyde,
[01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:16.720]   then into something called retinoic acid.
[01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:19.440]   Now, very important to know that retinoic acid
[01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:22.080]   is involved in a lot of different cellular processes,
[01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:24.360]   especially during neural development.
[01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:26.920]   This is why, and please pay careful attention to this,
[01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:30.260]   this is why women who are pregnant or breastfeeding
[01:27:30.260 --> 01:27:32.760]   should avoid taking these products
[01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:36.140]   because it can seriously disrupt the development
[01:27:36.140 --> 01:27:37.520]   of the fetus, okay?
[01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:39.800]   And keep in mind that many times people don't realize
[01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:42.120]   they're pregnant for some period of time,
[01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:44.840]   so this is of paramount concern, okay?
[01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:46.680]   We could have a whole discussion as to the role
[01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:49.040]   of retinoic acid in fetal development,
[01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:51.760]   but you don't want to tamper with that pathway, okay?
[01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:53.840]   Very serious consequences can occur.
[01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:55.720]   Okay, so when retinoic acid gets into cells,
[01:27:55.720 --> 01:27:58.180]   it can activate what's called transcription factors.
[01:27:58.180 --> 01:28:02.560]   Transcription factors bind to DNA, okay, your genetic code,
[01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:06.120]   and can induce the transcription and translation of DNA
[01:28:06.120 --> 01:28:09.200]   into RNA and RNA into proteins of particular types.
[01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:12.400]   So think of transcription factors as sort of setting a menu
[01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:15.320]   of different proteins that ultimately will be formed, okay?
[01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:18.040]   By binding to DNA, and then you get DNA to RNA,
[01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:20.720]   RNA to protein, and you're getting a set of proteins
[01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:22.160]   related to a particular process.
[01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:25.200]   That's generally how transcription factors work.
[01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:27.520]   And retin-A, tretinoin, and things similar to that
[01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:30.420]   are going to induce the formation of collagen protein
[01:28:30.420 --> 01:28:33.280]   within skin, as well as other proteins that relate
[01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:36.000]   to the formation of de novo skin, new skin,
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.920]   and can replace old degenerated skin.
[01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:42.640]   So the dermatologists that I spoke to were really bullish
[01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:45.000]   about the fact that, believe it or not,
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:48.040]   they felt that people starting in their 20s
[01:28:48.040 --> 01:28:49.880]   could very well, as long as they're not pregnant
[01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:52.580]   or lactating or planning to get pregnant,
[01:28:52.580 --> 01:28:56.000]   could take retin-A or things similar to it
[01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:59.360]   in order to stimulate the production of more skin
[01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:00.680]   and look more youthful.
[01:29:00.680 --> 01:29:02.760]   Now, for people already in their 20s, you know,
[01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:04.660]   by my read, they're already youthful,
[01:29:04.660 --> 01:29:08.040]   but that they could initiate the use of these compounds,
[01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:10.360]   at least in one's 20s and continuing on,
[01:29:10.360 --> 01:29:13.320]   really, as long as they wanted through life.
[01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:15.640]   And they told me about, quote, "remarkable results."
[01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:17.440]   So I said, well, why isn't everyone aware of this?
[01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:19.040]   Why isn't everyone taking them?
[01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:21.440]   Well, it turns out that these different compounds
[01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:24.440]   can also increase sensitivity to light,
[01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:26.520]   make you more prone to sunburn,
[01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:28.280]   to some of the other effects of light on skin,
[01:29:28.280 --> 01:29:31.040]   even from screens or from artificial lights.
[01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:32.760]   So one has to be careful about inducing
[01:29:32.760 --> 01:29:34.920]   too much skin sensitivity to light of all kinds,
[01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:36.360]   not just sunlight,
[01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:38.400]   that they can also induce some redness or dryness.
[01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:40.120]   So one has to get the dosage right,
[01:29:40.120 --> 01:29:41.600]   the frequency of use right,
[01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:43.080]   and they can be a little bit tricky to work with,
[01:29:43.080 --> 01:29:45.960]   but that if one can home in on the right dosages,
[01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:48.040]   the right frequency, et cetera,
[01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:50.240]   the dermatologists felt like this was one of the best things
[01:29:50.240 --> 01:29:52.520]   that one could do to improve the youthfulness
[01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:54.880]   or the appearance of youthfulness in one's skin.
[01:29:54.880 --> 01:29:56.760]   Now, I find this interesting for a number of reasons.
[01:29:56.760 --> 01:29:58.640]   First of all, I've heard of Retin-A, right?
[01:29:58.640 --> 01:30:01.280]   I've heard of these compounds before,
[01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:03.720]   but I hadn't heard about all these, you know,
[01:30:03.720 --> 01:30:07.320]   reportedly spectacular things like improved angiogenesis,
[01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:08.480]   vascularization of the skin.
[01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:12.360]   This is why people are taking the rather experimental,
[01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:15.920]   untested BPC-157 that I talked about before,
[01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:18.060]   the improved elasticity of skin,
[01:30:18.060 --> 01:30:19.960]   which somehow seems related to the ability
[01:30:19.960 --> 01:30:23.260]   of these compounds to remove degenerated elastin
[01:30:23.260 --> 01:30:25.080]   within the skin, to clear that out,
[01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:27.800]   as well as to induce de novo synthesis,
[01:30:27.800 --> 01:30:30.640]   and even the number of different fibroblasts
[01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:31.780]   that are present in skin.
[01:30:31.780 --> 01:30:35.480]   So more new skin, clearing away of old skin,
[01:30:35.480 --> 01:30:37.480]   improved vascularization.
[01:30:37.480 --> 01:30:39.080]   And while all of this sounds a little bit too good
[01:30:39.080 --> 01:30:43.800]   to be true, the mechanisms by which it's asserted to work
[01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:44.640]   all hold up.
[01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:46.040]   So that's always reassuring, right?
[01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:47.160]   Mechanism isn't everything,
[01:30:47.160 --> 01:30:48.920]   but it's really nice to see there.
[01:30:48.920 --> 01:30:50.720]   For instance, these compounds are known to get
[01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:52.880]   into the nucleus of cells, right?
[01:30:52.880 --> 01:30:54.060]   To impact gene expression.
[01:30:54.060 --> 01:30:55.000]   We talked about that before.
[01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:56.960]   You have receptors on the surface of cells.
[01:30:56.960 --> 01:30:58.780]   Okay, so cell surface receptors.
[01:30:58.780 --> 01:31:00.920]   You also have nuclear receptors.
[01:31:00.920 --> 01:31:02.800]   And the ability of certain things, we call them ligands,
[01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:04.280]   but these are chemicals, right?
[01:31:04.280 --> 01:31:06.560]   In this case, you know, in the vitamin A pathway
[01:31:06.560 --> 01:31:09.520]   to get into the nucleus of cells and impact gene expression.
[01:31:09.520 --> 01:31:11.740]   This is actually how hormones like testosterone
[01:31:11.740 --> 01:31:14.060]   and estrogen change the way that people look
[01:31:14.060 --> 01:31:15.440]   so dramatically during puberty.
[01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:16.400]   They actually, you know,
[01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:18.360]   they operate by binding to cell surface receptors.
[01:31:18.360 --> 01:31:20.900]   They also get into the nuclear compartment of the cell.
[01:31:20.900 --> 01:31:22.240]   They bind to nuclear receptors
[01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:24.760]   and they turn on entire genetic programs that cause,
[01:31:24.760 --> 01:31:26.040]   for instance, deepening of the voice
[01:31:26.040 --> 01:31:28.000]   or the growth of hair or breast tissue, et cetera.
[01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:29.880]   So these are powerful compounds.
[01:31:29.880 --> 01:31:33.040]   Now I talked to a cosmetic surgeon expert
[01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:35.280]   in face specifically.
[01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:36.440]   Remember, cosmetic surgery is done
[01:31:36.440 --> 01:31:38.120]   for a number of different areas of the body,
[01:31:38.120 --> 01:31:39.920]   but for face specifically,
[01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:43.600]   who also specializes in these sorts of treatments for skin.
[01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:45.480]   And they've started using,
[01:31:45.480 --> 01:31:47.960]   and are frankly quite confident in,
[01:31:47.960 --> 01:31:50.320]   the use of retinoid esters
[01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:53.080]   that can be applied to the surface of the skin.
[01:31:53.080 --> 01:31:55.140]   These things are available not by prescription.
[01:31:55.140 --> 01:31:58.000]   There's far less research on these sorts of compounds,
[01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.880]   but these compounds get enough positive support
[01:32:00.880 --> 01:32:02.200]   from the people that have tried them,
[01:32:02.200 --> 01:32:05.040]   reporting improved youthfulness of skin, et cetera,
[01:32:05.040 --> 01:32:07.880]   that some of them are becoming quite sought after
[01:32:07.880 --> 01:32:09.280]   and people, let's just say,
[01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:10.880]   are very enthusiastic about them.
[01:32:10.880 --> 01:32:12.080]   And I will say that in discussing
[01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:13.880]   the various mechanisms of this
[01:32:13.880 --> 01:32:16.920]   with these cosmetic surgeons and some dermatologists,
[01:32:16.920 --> 01:32:18.240]   the logic holds up.
[01:32:18.240 --> 01:32:20.280]   So you're starting to see more and more of these.
[01:32:20.280 --> 01:32:22.680]   Now, as I mentioned at the beginning of today's episode,
[01:32:22.680 --> 01:32:26.440]   there is zero business relationship between me,
[01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:28.960]   the podcast, or any of these people
[01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:31.680]   that have marketed serums or creams
[01:32:31.680 --> 01:32:33.440]   or prescription drugs for that matter,
[01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:35.280]   related to skin health and skincare.
[01:32:35.280 --> 01:32:37.200]   However, I have provided a couple of links
[01:32:37.200 --> 01:32:38.600]   in the show note captions
[01:32:38.600 --> 01:32:40.240]   of some of the different sources of these.
[01:32:40.240 --> 01:32:42.000]   Obviously, if you need a prescription
[01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:43.980]   for something like tretinoin or something similar,
[01:32:43.980 --> 01:32:46.600]   because you're interested in this whole retinol,
[01:32:46.600 --> 01:32:49.560]   retin-A, vitamin A pathway story,
[01:32:49.560 --> 01:32:52.280]   you need to talk to a board-certified dermatologist
[01:32:52.280 --> 01:32:53.840]   who could potentially prescribe that for you
[01:32:53.840 --> 01:32:55.560]   if they decide it's right for you.
[01:32:55.560 --> 01:32:58.360]   But in terms of these topical ointments and serums
[01:32:58.360 --> 01:33:00.080]   and creams and things like that,
[01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:02.640]   I do provide a link to at least one source of those
[01:33:02.640 --> 01:33:04.320]   that uses the retinoid ester.
[01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:06.680]   Just keep in mind that these various ointments and serums
[01:33:06.680 --> 01:33:08.840]   do not yet have the randomized control trials
[01:33:08.840 --> 01:33:11.240]   to support them that some of the other compounds
[01:33:11.240 --> 01:33:13.180]   that we were discussing do have.
[01:33:13.180 --> 01:33:15.040]   Now, I'd like to talk about things that one can do
[01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:18.200]   to improve the health and appearance of one's skin
[01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:20.220]   that don't involve taking anything
[01:33:20.220 --> 01:33:22.760]   or putting on any kind of ointment or serum
[01:33:22.760 --> 01:33:24.440]   or anything like that.
[01:33:24.440 --> 01:33:27.520]   And what I'm referring to is phototherapy.
[01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:29.640]   Now, at the earlier part of the episode,
[01:33:29.640 --> 01:33:31.760]   I talked about how different wavelengths of light,
[01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:33.680]   like UV light and long wavelength light
[01:33:33.680 --> 01:33:36.240]   can penetrate skin to different depths
[01:33:36.240 --> 01:33:37.960]   and some of the negative,
[01:33:37.960 --> 01:33:39.960]   but also positive things that that can do.
[01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:41.600]   So for instance, we talked about UV light
[01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:45.320]   mutating DNA in cells and potentially causing cancers,
[01:33:45.320 --> 01:33:48.520]   accelerating the aging process and so forth.
[01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:51.100]   But as you also recall, long wavelength light,
[01:33:51.100 --> 01:33:53.420]   so-called red light and near infrared light,
[01:33:53.420 --> 01:33:55.940]   which is even longer wavelengths of light
[01:33:55.940 --> 01:33:57.760]   can penetrate deep into the skin tissue.
[01:33:57.760 --> 01:34:00.000]   So pass that outer epidermal layer
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.320]   into the dermal layers of the skin
[01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:05.960]   and can access the vasculature, the neurons,
[01:34:05.960 --> 01:34:08.720]   some of the glands located deeper in the skin.
[01:34:08.720 --> 01:34:10.400]   And of course, the cells there,
[01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:13.720]   like cells in the epidermis, I should point out,
[01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:15.160]   contain things like mitochondria
[01:34:15.160 --> 01:34:17.640]   for which red light has been shown to be beneficial.
[01:34:17.640 --> 01:34:18.600]   Why?
[01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:21.400]   Red light and near infrared light phototherapy
[01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:24.140]   has been shown to reduce reactive oxygen species
[01:34:24.140 --> 01:34:27.440]   and thereby to improve mitochondrial function in cells.
[01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:29.400]   And that in turn has been shown to be beneficial
[01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:32.040]   for all the different processes within cells
[01:34:32.040 --> 01:34:33.100]   that involve mitochondria,
[01:34:33.100 --> 01:34:35.320]   which of course include energy production,
[01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:37.640]   but a bunch of other things too.
[01:34:37.640 --> 01:34:40.640]   So when I say that phototherapy has been shown
[01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:42.280]   to be beneficial for cells of the body,
[01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:44.000]   it's not just cells of the skin.
[01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:47.120]   In fact, a Nobel prize was granted in the early 1900s
[01:34:47.120 --> 01:34:50.440]   for the use of phototherapy for the treatment of lupus.
[01:34:50.440 --> 01:34:52.420]   So this is not a new technology.
[01:34:52.420 --> 01:34:55.920]   At the same time, while there are many studies
[01:34:55.920 --> 01:34:57.400]   exploring the use of phototherapy
[01:34:57.400 --> 01:34:59.920]   for improvement of skin health and appearance,
[01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:02.460]   most of those studies have fairly low sample sizes,
[01:35:02.460 --> 01:35:04.400]   but there are a lot of those studies.
[01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:07.480]   And fortunately by now, there are a few meta-analyses
[01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:10.120]   and reviews that take into account
[01:35:10.120 --> 01:35:11.160]   lots of different studies
[01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:13.080]   using slightly different wavelengths of light
[01:35:13.080 --> 01:35:14.720]   applied to different portions of the face
[01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:17.060]   for different purposes, treatment of acne,
[01:35:17.060 --> 01:35:19.640]   maybe even putting red light near infrared light
[01:35:19.640 --> 01:35:20.900]   on one half of the face
[01:35:20.900 --> 01:35:23.660]   to have a so-called within person control
[01:35:23.660 --> 01:35:25.820]   to compare the changes in skin
[01:35:25.820 --> 01:35:27.640]   or lack of changes in skin as the case may be
[01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:29.760]   between one side of the face and the other.
[01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:31.540]   I'll put links to some of these studies
[01:35:31.540 --> 01:35:34.600]   and some of the meta-analyses and reviews of these studies.
[01:35:34.600 --> 01:35:37.380]   One that I like in particular was published in 2018
[01:35:37.380 --> 01:35:39.600]   entitled "Light Emitting Diodes in Dermatology,
[01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:42.560]   A Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials."
[01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:44.360]   Of course, randomized controlled trials
[01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:46.600]   being one very powerful way to analyze
[01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:49.160]   the utility of a practice or a compound.
[01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:51.960]   It's not the only way to assess the utility of something.
[01:35:51.960 --> 01:35:53.840]   I know some people argue that they are very useful,
[01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:56.960]   but keep in mind in the field of medicine,
[01:35:56.960 --> 01:35:58.760]   we often have entire fields
[01:35:58.760 --> 01:36:00.660]   or even entire chapters of medical books
[01:36:00.660 --> 01:36:01.960]   that are based on case studies.
[01:36:01.960 --> 01:36:05.140]   For instance, we implicate the so-called hippocampus
[01:36:05.140 --> 01:36:09.240]   of the brain for its function in human memory,
[01:36:09.240 --> 01:36:10.960]   which it absolutely has.
[01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:14.140]   And that fact largely grew from one major case study
[01:36:14.140 --> 01:36:17.760]   that then exploded into a number of different animal model
[01:36:17.760 --> 01:36:19.840]   and then human studies later on.
[01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:22.360]   So we all love randomized controlled trials,
[01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:23.740]   reviews of randomized controlled trials
[01:36:23.740 --> 01:36:25.280]   and the uses of their phototherapy
[01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:27.440]   for treatment of skin conditions
[01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:31.200]   and improving the quality of skin are wonderful
[01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:34.560]   and point to the fact that phototherapy
[01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:37.220]   can indeed improve the appearance of skin
[01:36:37.220 --> 01:36:40.280]   in conditions like acne, can accelerate wound healing,
[01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:43.500]   can improve the youthfulness appearance of skin,
[01:36:43.500 --> 01:36:46.440]   but these effects tend to be somewhat mild
[01:36:46.440 --> 01:36:47.740]   to moderate when they occur.
[01:36:47.740 --> 01:36:49.440]   And certainly there are many studies
[01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:51.360]   that show no significant effect,
[01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:53.720]   no statistically significant effect.
[01:36:53.720 --> 01:36:55.360]   That said, I'm of the belief
[01:36:55.360 --> 01:36:56.900]   based on my read of the literature,
[01:36:56.900 --> 01:36:58.900]   and this is a literature I've spent a lot of time with,
[01:36:58.900 --> 01:37:01.980]   frankly, because I did an episode all about light and health.
[01:37:01.980 --> 01:37:04.120]   I've also been very interested in the use of phototherapy
[01:37:04.120 --> 01:37:06.820]   for the treatment of eye diseases
[01:37:06.820 --> 01:37:10.000]   and offsetting age-related decline in visual function.
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:11.380]   There's some interesting evidence there.
[01:37:11.380 --> 01:37:13.380]   Again, mild to moderate effects,
[01:37:13.380 --> 01:37:15.200]   but that can be meaningful in the real world.
[01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:17.680]   And when I step back from all of the literature,
[01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:18.680]   here's what I see.
[01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:21.680]   And this is what I ran by a dermatologist
[01:37:21.680 --> 01:37:25.120]   to make sure that they thought that this protocol
[01:37:25.120 --> 01:37:27.560]   would be useful or not useful, right?
[01:37:27.560 --> 01:37:29.600]   I asked them, I didn't tell them,
[01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:30.880]   do you think this will be useful?
[01:37:30.880 --> 01:37:32.600]   Tell me yes, I asked them.
[01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:34.920]   And what we basically converged on was
[01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:37.100]   that if somebody decides to do phototherapy,
[01:37:37.100 --> 01:37:38.200]   the use of phototherapy
[01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:39.920]   that involves long wavelengths of light,
[01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:43.800]   so red light plus near infrared light, typically,
[01:37:43.800 --> 01:37:48.060]   at a distance of about a foot to two feet
[01:37:48.060 --> 01:37:48.960]   from the light source,
[01:37:48.960 --> 01:37:50.920]   depending on the intensity of the light source,
[01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:53.200]   although that doesn't seem to be so critical,
[01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:56.040]   but one can't be across the room from the red light source,
[01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:58.680]   nor should one get right up next to the red light source
[01:37:58.680 --> 01:38:00.000]   so that there's a lot of heat
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.560]   generated from the red light source that one can feel.
[01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:05.880]   But at a distance of about a foot to two feet away
[01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:07.400]   at fairly high intensities,
[01:38:07.400 --> 01:38:10.300]   done for anywhere from 10 to 15 minutes,
[01:38:10.300 --> 01:38:14.080]   five to seven days per week on a consistent basis,
[01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:17.200]   does seem on average to lead to improvements
[01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:19.900]   in the youthfulness appearance of skin.
[01:38:19.900 --> 01:38:22.640]   Why this would be the case isn't exactly clear,
[01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:24.880]   but there are a number of different logical interpretations
[01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:26.280]   such as reduced inflammation,
[01:38:26.280 --> 01:38:28.220]   improved mitochondrial function,
[01:38:28.220 --> 01:38:31.460]   all downstream of reduced reactive oxygen species,
[01:38:31.460 --> 01:38:34.200]   improved blood flow to that particular area
[01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:36.120]   because of the effect that long wavelength light
[01:38:36.120 --> 01:38:38.240]   can have on vasodilation,
[01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:40.120]   sort of expansion as opposed to contraction
[01:38:40.120 --> 01:38:41.760]   of blood vessels and capillaries.
[01:38:41.760 --> 01:38:44.140]   All of this makes mechanistic logical sense,
[01:38:44.140 --> 01:38:45.880]   and the effects that one sees
[01:38:45.880 --> 01:38:47.800]   in these various peer-reviewed papers,
[01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:50.640]   randomized controlled trials, seem pretty good,
[01:38:50.640 --> 01:38:53.160]   meaning they are mild to moderate.
[01:38:53.160 --> 01:38:55.040]   None of them are sort of jaw-dropping,
[01:38:55.040 --> 01:38:57.680]   like, wow, complete reversal of severe acne
[01:38:57.680 --> 01:39:00.520]   or massively accelerated wound healing.
[01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:02.500]   And we also, of course, have to take into account
[01:39:02.500 --> 01:39:04.240]   that many people who are doing phototherapy
[01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:06.500]   often are combining it with other things,
[01:39:06.500 --> 01:39:09.860]   sometimes in today's era, like injections of BPC-157
[01:39:09.860 --> 01:39:13.100]   or the use of hyaluronic acid or niacinamide, et cetera.
[01:39:13.100 --> 01:39:16.660]   So these things aren't always being examined in isolation,
[01:39:16.660 --> 01:39:19.380]   but when we look at this literature,
[01:39:19.380 --> 01:39:21.420]   I think it's fair to say that there is now
[01:39:21.420 --> 01:39:24.000]   substantial evidence for the use of phototherapy
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.320]   for improving the quality of skin,
[01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:30.460]   and in some cases for reducing the symptoms of acne,
[01:39:30.460 --> 01:39:32.120]   reducing the symptoms of psoriasis,
[01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:34.640]   basically any condition where improved blood flow,
[01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:38.540]   lowered inflammation, fewer or reduced oxygen species,
[01:39:38.540 --> 01:39:41.400]   improved mitochondrial function, delivery of nutrients,
[01:39:41.400 --> 01:39:44.040]   anytime some or all of those things are gonna be involved,
[01:39:44.040 --> 01:39:46.200]   phototherapy makes logical sense,
[01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:47.960]   and so it's no surprise that we're seeing
[01:39:47.960 --> 01:39:51.440]   increased evidence for phototherapy in these conditions.
[01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:52.960]   Now, I've provided a link to the review
[01:39:52.960 --> 01:39:54.180]   of the randomized controlled trials
[01:39:54.180 --> 01:39:55.780]   that I mentioned a bit ago.
[01:39:55.780 --> 01:39:58.640]   I also provided a few links to some specific studies
[01:39:58.640 --> 01:40:01.180]   that show pictures of before and after,
[01:40:01.180 --> 01:40:03.640]   in some cases on two sides of the very same face.
[01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:07.900]   I did an entire episode about light and health.
[01:40:07.900 --> 01:40:09.640]   I'll also provide a link to that episode,
[01:40:09.640 --> 01:40:10.560]   and if you don't wanna listen to
[01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:11.760]   or watch that entire episode,
[01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:14.960]   you can go to specific timestamps in that episode
[01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:17.000]   to learn about the uses of phototherapy
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.760]   for the treatment of skin, eye, and other conditions
[01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:22.040]   related to mental health and physical health.
[01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:25.160]   Now, keep in mind that when people hear phototherapy,
[01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:27.720]   they almost immediately think about a device,
[01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:28.760]   and that makes sense, right?
[01:40:28.760 --> 01:40:30.460]   Red light, near-infrared light.
[01:40:30.460 --> 01:40:34.000]   However, if you recall, there's this thing called the sun
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:35.920]   that emits a full-spectrum light,
[01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:38.880]   which of course includes red light
[01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:40.960]   and longer wavelengths of light, okay?
[01:40:40.960 --> 01:40:41.980]   So just 'cause you can't see
[01:40:41.980 --> 01:40:43.080]   those longer wavelengths of light,
[01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:45.200]   that doesn't mean they're not there, just like UV light.
[01:40:45.200 --> 01:40:46.600]   You can't sense UV light with your eyes.
[01:40:46.600 --> 01:40:49.080]   By the way, ground squirrels and some other animals can.
[01:40:49.080 --> 01:40:51.700]   It's thought to be the case that they have photoreceptors
[01:40:51.700 --> 01:40:54.640]   to detect UV because they actually,
[01:40:54.640 --> 01:40:56.160]   this is sort of strange but interesting,
[01:40:56.160 --> 01:40:58.160]   you'll never forget this, that they'll take their urine
[01:40:58.160 --> 01:40:59.740]   and they'll spread it on their stomach
[01:40:59.740 --> 01:41:01.200]   with their little paws and they'll stand up
[01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:02.880]   and they'll like signal flash one another
[01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:05.000]   from across the prairie or whatever it is
[01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:06.580]   or across the lawn to signal to one another.
[01:41:06.580 --> 01:41:09.520]   So they're sending UVP signals across the lawn.
[01:41:09.520 --> 01:41:10.560]   I'm not making this up.
[01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:11.800]   I actually studied a little bit of this
[01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:13.160]   when I was an undergraduate,
[01:41:13.160 --> 01:41:15.000]   but not at the level of the urine and the signaling,
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.040]   at the level of the retina.
[01:41:17.040 --> 01:41:19.380]   Any discussion about skin
[01:41:19.380 --> 01:41:21.800]   has to include a discussion about nutrition.
[01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:22.760]   Why?
[01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:23.960]   Well, remember the fact that I mentioned
[01:41:23.960 --> 01:41:25.480]   at the beginning of today's episode
[01:41:25.480 --> 01:41:27.720]   that your skin and your immune system
[01:41:27.720 --> 01:41:30.140]   have a very intimate relationship.
[01:41:30.140 --> 01:41:31.040]   It's bi-directional.
[01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:33.680]   Your skin reflects the status of your immune system
[01:41:33.680 --> 01:41:34.720]   in many ways.
[01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:37.960]   And this is why many people with autoimmune conditions,
[01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:40.120]   things like lichen planus, you can look it up,
[01:41:40.120 --> 01:41:44.740]   or if you mind particularly striking photographs,
[01:41:44.740 --> 01:41:45.840]   please don't look it up.
[01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:48.320]   But people that have autoimmune conditions
[01:41:48.320 --> 01:41:50.800]   that often manifest in skin conditions.
[01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:53.280]   We'll talk more about this in the context of psoriasis
[01:41:53.280 --> 01:41:54.360]   in a little bit.
[01:41:54.360 --> 01:41:58.240]   But anytime we're talking about the immune system or skin,
[01:41:58.240 --> 01:41:59.560]   we need to take into account
[01:41:59.560 --> 01:42:02.160]   the gut microbiome and nutrition.
[01:42:02.160 --> 01:42:03.840]   So many people asked,
[01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:05.520]   what are the things that they should eat
[01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:07.880]   to have healthy appearing youthful skin?
[01:42:07.880 --> 01:42:09.780]   They also asked,
[01:42:09.780 --> 01:42:12.040]   what are the things that one eats
[01:42:12.040 --> 01:42:15.300]   that could exacerbate things like acne?
[01:42:15.300 --> 01:42:18.260]   And what can one eat in order to reduce their acne?
[01:42:18.260 --> 01:42:20.260]   So let's just start off with the basics.
[01:42:20.260 --> 01:42:21.880]   And here I'm going to be fairly brief
[01:42:21.880 --> 01:42:25.480]   because I think we all know the big take-home message
[01:42:25.480 --> 01:42:27.560]   about nutrition nowadays.
[01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:28.840]   We hear over and over again,
[01:42:28.840 --> 01:42:30.280]   and we should pay attention to the fact
[01:42:30.280 --> 01:42:32.940]   that the vast majority of our food,
[01:42:32.940 --> 01:42:33.780]   well, I should say,
[01:42:33.780 --> 01:42:36.080]   if one desires to be healthy, mentally healthy,
[01:42:36.080 --> 01:42:37.160]   physically healthy,
[01:42:37.160 --> 01:42:38.560]   and a high-performing individual
[01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:39.720]   in any number of different things,
[01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:41.920]   cognitive, physical, or otherwise,
[01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:44.840]   we want to consume the vast majority of our foods
[01:42:44.840 --> 01:42:48.240]   from non-processed or minimally processed sources,
[01:42:48.240 --> 01:42:49.120]   so-called whole foods.
[01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:51.800]   So fruits, vegetables, if that's within your diet,
[01:42:51.800 --> 01:42:54.040]   some people include grains, some people don't.
[01:42:54.040 --> 01:42:56.140]   I'm not here to discuss that.
[01:42:56.140 --> 01:42:59.360]   Meat, eggs, fish, chicken, and so forth,
[01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:02.800]   if that's within your diet plan or your nutrition,
[01:43:02.800 --> 01:43:04.300]   or if you're a vegetarian or vegan,
[01:43:04.300 --> 01:43:06.840]   you make the associated adjustments
[01:43:06.840 --> 01:43:08.520]   so that you can make sure you're getting enough protein
[01:43:08.520 --> 01:43:09.360]   and amino acids,
[01:43:09.360 --> 01:43:11.320]   but it's in keeping with your ethical
[01:43:11.320 --> 01:43:12.640]   and maybe your health goals, okay?
[01:43:12.640 --> 01:43:15.200]   So we're not here to discuss vegan, vegetarian,
[01:43:15.200 --> 01:43:18.680]   omnivore, of which I am, or carnivore, okay?
[01:43:18.680 --> 01:43:20.140]   That's not the discussion.
[01:43:20.140 --> 01:43:22.240]   I think all of those groups agree
[01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:23.840]   that getting the majority of your nutrition
[01:43:23.840 --> 01:43:26.400]   from non-processed or minimally processed foods
[01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:28.120]   is going to be best,
[01:43:28.120 --> 01:43:29.960]   and that, of course, if you're human,
[01:43:29.960 --> 01:43:31.880]   sometimes you'll ingest processed foods,
[01:43:31.880 --> 01:43:34.400]   but really trying to avoid highly processed foods
[01:43:34.400 --> 01:43:35.400]   is critical.
[01:43:35.400 --> 01:43:38.000]   Now, with respect to the specific foods
[01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:41.600]   that can improve skin appearance and skin health,
[01:43:41.600 --> 01:43:43.800]   it's very clear that diets
[01:43:43.800 --> 01:43:46.760]   that are of the so-called low-inflammatory type,
[01:43:46.760 --> 01:43:48.240]   that don't spark inflammation,
[01:43:48.240 --> 01:43:49.960]   so these would be things that sometimes are referred to
[01:43:49.960 --> 01:43:52.300]   as the Mediterranean diet or a paleo-like diet.
[01:43:52.300 --> 01:43:53.300]   You hear these terms,
[01:43:53.300 --> 01:43:55.320]   but what are we really talking about?
[01:43:55.320 --> 01:43:58.220]   Mostly whole foods, minimally processed foods, okay?
[01:43:58.220 --> 01:44:00.780]   And then there's variation depending on whether or not
[01:44:00.780 --> 01:44:03.520]   you emphasize or de-emphasize meat and fish
[01:44:03.520 --> 01:44:05.460]   or emphasize or de-emphasize vegetables,
[01:44:05.460 --> 01:44:06.320]   this kind of thing.
[01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:07.380]   Again, I'm an omnivore.
[01:44:07.380 --> 01:44:08.220]   I love fruit.
[01:44:08.220 --> 01:44:09.460]   I love vegetables.
[01:44:09.460 --> 01:44:11.420]   I do like rice, oatmeal, and some pastas.
[01:44:11.420 --> 01:44:12.720]   I like a great sourdough bread.
[01:44:12.720 --> 01:44:13.560]   I like butter.
[01:44:13.560 --> 01:44:14.380]   I like olive oil.
[01:44:14.380 --> 01:44:15.220]   I like meat.
[01:44:15.220 --> 01:44:16.060]   I like fish.
[01:44:16.060 --> 01:44:18.260]   I think I am representative of most people out there
[01:44:18.260 --> 01:44:20.120]   because I eat most all those things,
[01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:22.720]   but I also eat the occasional croissant.
[01:44:22.720 --> 01:44:24.320]   I also eat the occasional slice of pizza.
[01:44:24.320 --> 01:44:25.340]   I don't eat a lot of that stuff,
[01:44:25.340 --> 01:44:26.520]   but I eat it now and again.
[01:44:26.520 --> 01:44:28.800]   And then of course you have people that are super strict.
[01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:30.880]   What do we know about the relationship
[01:44:30.880 --> 01:44:34.080]   between specific foods and skin health and skin appearance?
[01:44:34.080 --> 01:44:36.280]   Well, anti-inflammatory diet,
[01:44:36.280 --> 01:44:38.560]   we've more or less spelled out what that represents
[01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:40.320]   without getting into too many specifics.
[01:44:40.320 --> 01:44:43.040]   And then there are the specific components within foods.
[01:44:43.040 --> 01:44:46.400]   So vitamins, minerals, and micronutrients,
[01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:49.700]   as well as things like collagen present in bone broth
[01:44:49.700 --> 01:44:52.340]   that can be really useful to include.
[01:44:52.340 --> 01:44:54.020]   So one of the, I think,
[01:44:54.020 --> 01:44:56.780]   best accounts on dermatologic health
[01:44:56.780 --> 01:44:59.420]   and skin health and appearance on the internet
[01:44:59.420 --> 01:45:00.780]   is Dr. Andrea Suarez.
[01:45:00.780 --> 01:45:03.380]   She's a medical doctor, board-certified dermatologist,
[01:45:03.380 --> 01:45:05.020]   and she has a wonderful video
[01:45:05.020 --> 01:45:06.980]   that describes the various foods
[01:45:06.980 --> 01:45:09.380]   that one can eat to promote skin health and skin appearance.
[01:45:09.380 --> 01:45:11.480]   And rather than repeat that entire video,
[01:45:11.480 --> 01:45:13.380]   because A, that wouldn't be right,
[01:45:13.380 --> 01:45:16.760]   and B, it already exists out there in excellent form.
[01:45:16.760 --> 01:45:18.520]   I'll just give a brief synopsis
[01:45:18.520 --> 01:45:20.120]   of some of the things that she suggests
[01:45:20.120 --> 01:45:21.680]   because I entirely agree.
[01:45:21.680 --> 01:45:24.080]   And again, there's no need to be repetitive.
[01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:26.160]   And she does an excellent job.
[01:45:26.160 --> 01:45:29.360]   So she certainly mentions collagen and bone broth.
[01:45:29.360 --> 01:45:33.720]   She also mentions various sources of omega fatty acids
[01:45:33.720 --> 01:45:36.000]   that are often lacking in people's diets
[01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.740]   that they should pay extra careful attention to get.
[01:45:38.740 --> 01:45:42.100]   So things like walnuts, flax, fatty fish.
[01:45:42.100 --> 01:45:43.480]   I personally am a big believer
[01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:46.040]   in supplementing with liquid form fish oil.
[01:45:46.040 --> 01:45:46.880]   That's what I do.
[01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:48.140]   Why am I a big believer in that?
[01:45:48.140 --> 01:45:50.200]   Well, I don't tend to cook much fatty fish.
[01:45:50.200 --> 01:45:52.240]   I love the taste of it if it's prepared right,
[01:45:52.240 --> 01:45:53.720]   but I don't tend to do that very often.
[01:45:53.720 --> 01:45:56.760]   So I use a liquid form fish oil or capsules,
[01:45:56.760 --> 01:46:00.100]   but the liquid form is generally more affordable.
[01:46:00.100 --> 01:46:01.400]   This was discussed in an episode
[01:46:01.400 --> 01:46:03.240]   that I did with Dr. Rhonda Patrick.
[01:46:03.240 --> 01:46:05.000]   So we can put a link to that particular segment
[01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:06.680]   in the show note captions.
[01:46:06.680 --> 01:46:09.480]   It's also suggested that we eat a lot of leafy greens,
[01:46:09.480 --> 01:46:11.160]   so dark leafy greens.
[01:46:11.160 --> 01:46:12.980]   You're probably noticing a lot of these recommendations
[01:46:12.980 --> 01:46:15.420]   are kind of typical for what people describe any time
[01:46:15.420 --> 01:46:17.820]   they're talking about nutrition for health.
[01:46:17.820 --> 01:46:20.100]   She highly recommends people get enough folic acid
[01:46:20.100 --> 01:46:23.180]   for the role that folic acid plays in DNA synthesis
[01:46:23.180 --> 01:46:26.520]   and repair of skin cells as among other cells
[01:46:26.520 --> 01:46:29.220]   and cell proliferation.
[01:46:29.220 --> 01:46:32.080]   And of course we should get our colored fruits and veggies.
[01:46:32.080 --> 01:46:34.220]   So our oranges, our strawberries,
[01:46:34.220 --> 01:46:37.000]   the reds and oranges are critical out there.
[01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:38.700]   And she also highlights something very important
[01:46:38.700 --> 01:46:40.080]   that I want to reiterate,
[01:46:40.080 --> 01:46:42.300]   which is that we have a critical need for vitamin A
[01:46:42.300 --> 01:46:43.380]   for our skin health.
[01:46:43.380 --> 01:46:44.260]   And this was covered,
[01:46:44.260 --> 01:46:46.660]   albeit through the lens of exploring the pharmacology
[01:46:46.660 --> 01:46:49.180]   of tretinoin and those retin-A compounds.
[01:46:49.180 --> 01:46:51.100]   But vitamin A is crucial
[01:46:51.100 --> 01:46:52.660]   for a number of different processes
[01:46:52.660 --> 01:46:55.900]   within the cell types that make up skin.
[01:46:55.900 --> 01:46:57.260]   She appropriately cautions
[01:46:57.260 --> 01:46:59.040]   against supplementing with vitamin A
[01:46:59.040 --> 01:47:00.680]   because as a fat soluble vitamin,
[01:47:00.680 --> 01:47:02.900]   it's very easy to overdose vitamin A.
[01:47:02.900 --> 01:47:05.380]   If one is supplementing with too much of it,
[01:47:05.380 --> 01:47:07.540]   she recommends rather getting enough vitamin A
[01:47:07.540 --> 01:47:10.380]   from things like oranges, carrots, sweet potatoes.
[01:47:10.380 --> 01:47:12.960]   She recommends as much berry intake
[01:47:12.960 --> 01:47:14.780]   as is appropriate for someone and one can afford.
[01:47:14.780 --> 01:47:15.860]   The berries are so delicious,
[01:47:15.860 --> 01:47:19.100]   but they tend to be expensive depending on time of year.
[01:47:19.100 --> 01:47:24.100]   Ingesting things like garlic because garlic has sulfur,
[01:47:24.100 --> 01:47:27.300]   which is key for collagen synthesis and repair.
[01:47:27.300 --> 01:47:29.580]   And she talks about the critical role of taurine.
[01:47:29.580 --> 01:47:31.220]   Anyway, she does such a terrific job
[01:47:31.220 --> 01:47:32.660]   of describing the nutrition
[01:47:32.660 --> 01:47:34.620]   for skin health and skin appearance.
[01:47:34.620 --> 01:47:36.060]   Those are just a few of the highlights.
[01:47:36.060 --> 01:47:38.020]   I do encourage you to check out that video
[01:47:38.020 --> 01:47:41.020]   and her other content is spectacular as well.
[01:47:41.020 --> 01:47:42.380]   Again, she has an Instagram account,
[01:47:42.380 --> 01:47:44.600]   YouTube channel that are really wonderful.
[01:47:44.600 --> 01:47:47.420]   So again, without doing a deep dive into nutrition,
[01:47:47.420 --> 01:47:49.100]   decide whether or not you're going to be vegan,
[01:47:49.100 --> 01:47:51.660]   vegetarian, omnivore or carnivore,
[01:47:51.660 --> 01:47:53.100]   and then make sure that you're getting enough
[01:47:53.100 --> 01:47:55.380]   of the vitamins and minerals and micronutrients
[01:47:55.380 --> 01:47:57.980]   from your foods or supplement if necessary.
[01:47:57.980 --> 01:47:59.040]   But note that caution
[01:47:59.040 --> 01:48:00.940]   about vitamin A supplementation in excess.
[01:48:00.940 --> 01:48:03.340]   And also make sure you're avoiding excessive amounts
[01:48:03.340 --> 01:48:05.100]   of highly processed foods.
[01:48:05.100 --> 01:48:06.220]   You know, I mentioned earlier
[01:48:06.220 --> 01:48:08.660]   these advanced glycation end products.
[01:48:08.660 --> 01:48:09.780]   These are things that are present
[01:48:09.780 --> 01:48:11.100]   in a lot of processed foods,
[01:48:11.100 --> 01:48:13.180]   like crackers and chips and things like that,
[01:48:13.180 --> 01:48:15.180]   that make those foods inflammatory.
[01:48:15.180 --> 01:48:16.420]   So you're getting the theme now.
[01:48:16.420 --> 01:48:18.440]   Inflammation is bad, not just for the skin,
[01:48:18.440 --> 01:48:20.180]   but for all organ systems of the body.
[01:48:20.180 --> 01:48:23.380]   It's not just about the high density of calories
[01:48:23.380 --> 01:48:25.540]   and the high density of taste
[01:48:25.540 --> 01:48:27.260]   present in highly processed foods.
[01:48:27.260 --> 01:48:28.460]   Those are problematic,
[01:48:28.460 --> 01:48:30.840]   but a lot of the issue with these highly processed foods
[01:48:30.840 --> 01:48:32.980]   is the high heat conditions used
[01:48:32.980 --> 01:48:35.660]   to make those foods stable on shelves
[01:48:35.660 --> 01:48:37.620]   or stable in packaging over time.
[01:48:37.620 --> 01:48:39.780]   Okay, so there's a whole discussion to be had here
[01:48:39.780 --> 01:48:43.020]   that frankly, I don't think Amy had enough,
[01:48:43.020 --> 01:48:46.340]   but that is outside the scope of today's episode.
[01:48:46.340 --> 01:48:48.340]   The point is that when these highly processed foods
[01:48:48.340 --> 01:48:51.340]   are basically made, right, they're constructed,
[01:48:51.340 --> 01:48:53.340]   they involve the interactions
[01:48:53.340 --> 01:48:56.460]   between sugars and proteins and fats at high heat
[01:48:56.460 --> 01:48:59.000]   that make them stable on the shelf or in packaging.
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:02.020]   And those can be very inflammatory.
[01:49:02.020 --> 01:49:05.380]   And that can show up in the form of reactive skin.
[01:49:05.380 --> 01:49:06.960]   It can make your psoriasis worse.
[01:49:06.960 --> 01:49:08.380]   Yes, it can make your acne worse.
[01:49:08.380 --> 01:49:10.660]   It can make your skin more tender and painful.
[01:49:10.660 --> 01:49:13.260]   It can make your skin basically more reactive
[01:49:13.260 --> 01:49:16.160]   to some of the underlying predispositions you might have,
[01:49:16.160 --> 01:49:17.320]   either because of genetics
[01:49:17.320 --> 01:49:19.540]   or other things you're doing or not doing.
[01:49:19.540 --> 01:49:22.020]   Maybe you're going through a particularly stressful time.
[01:49:22.020 --> 01:49:23.940]   Maybe you're getting a little bit of extra sun
[01:49:23.940 --> 01:49:25.940]   and you're eating more highly processed foods
[01:49:25.940 --> 01:49:26.940]   and those things are combining
[01:49:26.940 --> 01:49:29.060]   and making your skin break out
[01:49:29.060 --> 01:49:31.660]   or flush more than it would ordinarily.
[01:49:31.660 --> 01:49:34.460]   Again, there's so many reasons to eat most of your foods
[01:49:34.460 --> 01:49:37.220]   from non-processed or minimally processed sources.
[01:49:37.220 --> 01:49:39.140]   And of course, and now I sound like a broken record
[01:49:39.140 --> 01:49:41.820]   'cause you can hear this all over the internet,
[01:49:41.820 --> 01:49:44.380]   ingesting foods that are excessively high in sugar,
[01:49:44.380 --> 01:49:47.040]   excessively high in sugars combined with fats,
[01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:48.720]   just not good to do.
[01:49:48.720 --> 01:49:51.620]   Pro-inflammatory, it's going to cause all sorts of issues.
[01:49:51.620 --> 01:49:52.860]   And we're going to get into this more
[01:49:52.860 --> 01:49:55.140]   as it relates to acne in particular,
[01:49:55.140 --> 01:49:57.220]   because as you probably know,
[01:49:57.220 --> 01:49:59.580]   when you ingest foods that are high in sugars
[01:49:59.580 --> 01:50:01.340]   or even just carbohydrates generally,
[01:50:01.340 --> 01:50:03.100]   that also contain a lot of fats,
[01:50:03.100 --> 01:50:05.660]   and in particular when those foods are highly processed,
[01:50:05.660 --> 01:50:07.900]   well, then you initiate an inflammatory response
[01:50:07.900 --> 01:50:10.940]   and you often can initiate additional things
[01:50:10.940 --> 01:50:12.900]   happening in the pores of cells
[01:50:12.900 --> 01:50:15.340]   that can start to really aggravate acne
[01:50:15.340 --> 01:50:17.260]   and cause more acne.
[01:50:17.260 --> 01:50:19.940]   This has to do with the whole insulin pathway.
[01:50:19.940 --> 01:50:20.980]   So when we talk about acne,
[01:50:20.980 --> 01:50:23.660]   I'll talk about diets that create a high glycemic load.
[01:50:23.660 --> 01:50:24.500]   We're not necessarily talking
[01:50:24.500 --> 01:50:26.700]   about the glycemic index of food.
[01:50:26.700 --> 01:50:28.580]   You may know that when people measure
[01:50:28.580 --> 01:50:29.700]   the glycemic index of food,
[01:50:29.700 --> 01:50:31.260]   they're looking at the blood sugar response
[01:50:31.260 --> 01:50:33.300]   after eating that food typically in isolation
[01:50:33.300 --> 01:50:34.620]   and not in combination with other foods.
[01:50:34.620 --> 01:50:37.500]   What I'm talking about is eating combinations of foods
[01:50:37.500 --> 01:50:39.580]   that induce high levels of insulin,
[01:50:39.580 --> 01:50:41.120]   high levels of blood glucose,
[01:50:41.120 --> 01:50:42.740]   that then leads all sorts of things
[01:50:42.740 --> 01:50:45.260]   in the hormone pathways and cell growth pathways
[01:50:45.260 --> 01:50:46.540]   that exacerbate acne.
[01:50:46.540 --> 01:50:47.620]   So we'll get there in a moment,
[01:50:47.620 --> 01:50:49.380]   but I think the take-home message
[01:50:49.380 --> 01:50:50.780]   around nutrition is pretty clear.
[01:50:50.780 --> 01:50:54.420]   So much so that I don't want to spend any more time on it.
[01:50:54.420 --> 01:50:58.220]   We all know what the best nutrition really is for us,
[01:50:58.220 --> 01:50:59.940]   regardless of whether or not you're vegan, vegetarian,
[01:50:59.940 --> 01:51:01.860]   omnivore or carnivore.
[01:51:01.860 --> 01:51:05.280]   It's non-processed or minimally processed foods
[01:51:05.280 --> 01:51:07.780]   representing probably anywhere from,
[01:51:07.780 --> 01:51:10.180]   let's say 75 to 100% of your food intake,
[01:51:10.180 --> 01:51:12.260]   depending on how strict you want to be.
[01:51:12.260 --> 01:51:14.860]   And then sure, make some room if you want
[01:51:14.860 --> 01:51:15.940]   for some processed foods,
[01:51:15.940 --> 01:51:19.740]   but just know that those advanced glycation end products
[01:51:19.740 --> 01:51:21.900]   and the high glycemic load
[01:51:21.900 --> 01:51:23.980]   that comes from those processed foods
[01:51:23.980 --> 01:51:26.900]   can really exacerbate inflammatory responses in skin
[01:51:26.900 --> 01:51:30.060]   and set forward a whole domino set of issues
[01:51:30.060 --> 01:51:32.900]   related to hormone pathways and cell growth pathways
[01:51:32.900 --> 01:51:35.260]   that make everything, acne, psoriasis,
[01:51:35.260 --> 01:51:36.900]   and overall appearance worse.
[01:51:36.900 --> 01:51:38.740]   Yes, your skin will appear to age faster.
[01:51:38.740 --> 01:51:40.340]   And on the positive side,
[01:51:40.340 --> 01:51:42.320]   most of the foods that we think of as healthy
[01:51:42.320 --> 01:51:45.060]   and anti-inflammatory are actually quite delicious.
[01:51:45.060 --> 01:51:46.540]   So enjoy.
[01:51:46.540 --> 01:51:49.520]   Ah, and I forgot to say what's absolutely clear.
[01:51:49.520 --> 01:51:52.220]   You know that myth that they told us when we were teenagers,
[01:51:52.220 --> 01:51:54.420]   that eating a lot of fried food would make you break out,
[01:51:54.420 --> 01:51:55.380]   would make your skin worse?
[01:51:55.380 --> 01:51:57.200]   Guess what? It's true.
[01:51:57.200 --> 01:51:59.140]   That high heat preparation required
[01:51:59.140 --> 01:52:01.340]   for creating things as delicious
[01:52:01.340 --> 01:52:03.700]   as the donut or French fries, right?
[01:52:03.700 --> 01:52:05.100]   There's a reason people love these foods.
[01:52:05.100 --> 01:52:06.340]   They're so delicious.
[01:52:06.340 --> 01:52:07.460]   They do cause problems.
[01:52:07.460 --> 01:52:09.280]   They're pro-inflammatory.
[01:52:09.280 --> 01:52:11.460]   Does that mean you can never have a French fry?
[01:52:11.460 --> 01:52:13.900]   No. You decide what's best for you,
[01:52:13.900 --> 01:52:15.500]   but know what you're doing.
[01:52:15.500 --> 01:52:17.220]   As a segue to talking about acne,
[01:52:17.220 --> 01:52:19.660]   we need to talk about the gut microbiome.
[01:52:19.660 --> 01:52:21.180]   And this is a direct outgrowth
[01:52:21.180 --> 01:52:22.780]   of our discussion about nutrition.
[01:52:22.780 --> 01:52:24.060]   Here's the simple takeaway
[01:52:24.060 --> 01:52:25.960]   that I believe everyone should follow,
[01:52:25.960 --> 01:52:28.660]   not just for sake of healthy appearing skin,
[01:52:28.660 --> 01:52:32.120]   but also for sake of every organ
[01:52:32.120 --> 01:52:33.240]   and tissue system in your body,
[01:52:33.240 --> 01:52:35.460]   which is the data clearly show
[01:52:35.460 --> 01:52:38.780]   that ingestion of sufficient amounts of fiber,
[01:52:38.780 --> 01:52:42.220]   so prebiotic and probiotic fiber, so fruits, vegetables,
[01:52:42.220 --> 01:52:44.180]   sometimes this can also come from grains.
[01:52:44.180 --> 01:52:46.820]   Some people will supplement with additional fiber
[01:52:46.820 --> 01:52:48.660]   if they feel they need it,
[01:52:48.660 --> 01:52:52.420]   as well as ingestion of low sugar fermented foods.
[01:52:52.420 --> 01:52:53.560]   I've talked about this before.
[01:52:53.560 --> 01:52:56.260]   So regular listeners of this podcast may have heard this.
[01:52:56.260 --> 01:52:59.060]   Things like kimchi, sauerkraut,
[01:52:59.060 --> 01:53:01.500]   the sort of sauerkraut that has to stay in the fridge.
[01:53:01.500 --> 01:53:03.020]   So not the stuff that's stable
[01:53:03.020 --> 01:53:04.780]   on the shelf at room temperature.
[01:53:04.780 --> 01:53:07.460]   Anything containing a brine, that salty brine.
[01:53:07.460 --> 01:53:09.260]   So pickles, but not the pickles
[01:53:09.260 --> 01:53:10.740]   that are stable at room temperature,
[01:53:10.740 --> 01:53:12.240]   the ones that have to be kept
[01:53:12.240 --> 01:53:14.340]   in the refrigerated section of the grocery store.
[01:53:14.340 --> 01:53:16.260]   These low sugar fermented foods
[01:53:16.260 --> 01:53:19.500]   are powerful enhancers of the gut microbiome.
[01:53:19.500 --> 01:53:21.060]   And when the gut microbiome is healthy,
[01:53:21.060 --> 01:53:24.840]   you have reduced overall inflammation in the body.
[01:53:24.840 --> 01:53:27.540]   This is often reflected at the level of the skin.
[01:53:27.540 --> 01:53:29.760]   And basically skin health
[01:53:29.760 --> 01:53:33.360]   and the youthfulness appearance of skin is enhanced, okay?
[01:53:33.360 --> 01:53:37.460]   This can also help with conditions like acne or psoriasis,
[01:53:37.460 --> 01:53:38.960]   especially in conditions
[01:53:38.960 --> 01:53:42.080]   where there's a direct immune system skin relationship
[01:53:42.080 --> 01:53:43.960]   that we'll talk about more in a little bit, okay?
[01:53:43.960 --> 01:53:45.960]   So I highly recommend people have anywhere
[01:53:45.960 --> 01:53:46.960]   from one to four servings
[01:53:46.960 --> 01:53:49.480]   of low sugar fermented foods per day,
[01:53:49.480 --> 01:53:51.820]   or try and enhance the health
[01:53:51.820 --> 01:53:53.940]   of their gut microbiome generally.
[01:53:53.940 --> 01:53:55.580]   Maybe you take a pill probiotic,
[01:53:55.580 --> 01:53:57.180]   although those can be very expensive.
[01:53:57.180 --> 01:53:58.840]   There's a little bit of data suggesting
[01:53:58.840 --> 01:54:02.060]   that if you chronically take pill probiotics
[01:54:02.060 --> 01:54:04.780]   that yield very high levels of bacteria,
[01:54:04.780 --> 01:54:06.980]   well then maybe there's some associated brain fog.
[01:54:06.980 --> 01:54:09.300]   That's a little unclear, pun intended,
[01:54:09.300 --> 01:54:11.940]   but they are very expensive.
[01:54:11.940 --> 01:54:13.180]   They have to be kept refrigerated
[01:54:13.180 --> 01:54:15.380]   and let's face it, low sugar fermented foods,
[01:54:15.380 --> 01:54:16.820]   if you find the ones that you like,
[01:54:16.820 --> 01:54:19.140]   are really great to ingest 'cause they're tasty
[01:54:19.140 --> 01:54:20.440]   and they're good for you.
[01:54:20.440 --> 01:54:22.240]   Now, why am I talking about this?
[01:54:22.240 --> 01:54:25.080]   In part, because we keep coming back to inflammation
[01:54:25.080 --> 01:54:26.760]   as a general issue for skin health.
[01:54:26.760 --> 01:54:29.800]   And that points us also towards some specific do's and don'ts
[01:54:29.800 --> 01:54:31.280]   as it relates to lifestyle.
[01:54:31.280 --> 01:54:36.280]   Let's face it, pun intended, if you sleep well,
[01:54:36.280 --> 01:54:38.080]   so maybe you need six hours, maybe you need seven,
[01:54:38.080 --> 01:54:39.540]   maybe you need eight, maybe you need nine,
[01:54:39.540 --> 01:54:41.460]   but if you sleep well on a consistent basis,
[01:54:41.460 --> 01:54:43.860]   your skin is going to look so much better,
[01:54:43.860 --> 01:54:46.160]   so much healthier, more vibrant
[01:54:46.160 --> 01:54:49.280]   than if you are not getting enough sleep.
[01:54:49.280 --> 01:54:52.720]   If you drink alcohol and you wake up the next morning,
[01:54:52.720 --> 01:54:54.280]   you know your skin's going to look puffy,
[01:54:54.280 --> 01:54:55.920]   it's not going to look good.
[01:54:55.920 --> 01:54:58.720]   But many of you can ingest alcohol without issues.
[01:54:58.720 --> 01:55:01.120]   I've done an entire episode about alcohol.
[01:55:01.120 --> 01:55:03.460]   Yes, it's a poison, up to two drinks per week.
[01:55:03.460 --> 01:55:06.100]   For adults who are non-alcoholics, it's probably safe.
[01:55:06.100 --> 01:55:08.580]   Zero is better than any, but let's face it,
[01:55:08.580 --> 01:55:11.920]   alcohol is going to exacerbate most skin issues.
[01:55:11.920 --> 01:55:14.120]   This is just clear from the literature.
[01:55:14.120 --> 01:55:15.800]   Doesn't mean you never have a glass of wine,
[01:55:15.800 --> 01:55:17.760]   doesn't mean you never have a beer or a cocktail
[01:55:17.760 --> 01:55:21.520]   if that's your thing, but alcohol consumed in excess,
[01:55:21.520 --> 01:55:23.320]   and it doesn't take much to get there,
[01:55:23.320 --> 01:55:25.960]   is going to cause sleep issues, microbiome issues,
[01:55:25.960 --> 01:55:28.880]   so indirectly and negatively impact
[01:55:28.880 --> 01:55:31.040]   the skin appearance and health,
[01:55:31.040 --> 01:55:34.120]   and indirectly and negatively impact
[01:55:34.120 --> 01:55:36.020]   the health of other tissues in your body.
[01:55:36.020 --> 01:55:37.560]   But it's clear, some of that is reduced
[01:55:37.560 --> 01:55:39.480]   to increase inflammation, some is related
[01:55:39.480 --> 01:55:42.800]   to decreased sleep quality or duration.
[01:55:42.800 --> 01:55:46.220]   So get great sleep, avoid alcohol in excess,
[01:55:46.220 --> 01:55:48.880]   maybe avoid it altogether, drink plenty of water.
[01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:50.800]   This sounds like such basic advice,
[01:55:50.800 --> 01:55:52.200]   but proper hydration is key.
[01:55:52.200 --> 01:55:54.200]   Get enough water and electrolytes.
[01:55:54.200 --> 01:55:57.560]   It absolutely will impact your inflammation levels
[01:55:57.560 --> 01:56:00.600]   by reducing them, it absolutely will impact
[01:56:00.600 --> 01:56:03.400]   your skin health and appearance in a positive way.
[01:56:03.400 --> 01:56:05.420]   So these are just basic things that I'd be remiss
[01:56:05.420 --> 01:56:06.560]   if I didn't mention.
[01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:08.360]   The other one is smoking and nicotine
[01:56:08.360 --> 01:56:10.460]   from non-smoked sources.
[01:56:10.460 --> 01:56:12.560]   So it's very clear that smoking, vaping,
[01:56:12.560 --> 01:56:15.680]   dipping or snuffing is bad for skin appearance and health.
[01:56:15.680 --> 01:56:19.360]   Bad, bad, bad, every dermatologist said this, why?
[01:56:19.360 --> 01:56:21.600]   Well, with smoking, you can imagine why, okay?
[01:56:21.600 --> 01:56:24.440]   A lot of carcinogens and toxic end products
[01:56:24.440 --> 01:56:27.260]   generated from smoking, even from vaping.
[01:56:27.260 --> 01:56:30.200]   Yes, even from vaping, it will make your skin age faster,
[01:56:30.200 --> 01:56:33.960]   that's clear, but it's also the substance itself.
[01:56:33.960 --> 01:56:34.800]   Why?
[01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:37.480]   All of those things, in addition to increasing inflammation,
[01:56:37.480 --> 01:56:39.400]   nicotine itself is a vasoconstrictor,
[01:56:39.400 --> 01:56:42.000]   so you're doing the exact opposite of what you want
[01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:43.760]   when it comes to skin health and appearance.
[01:56:43.760 --> 01:56:46.040]   And that's why people take things like BPC-157,
[01:56:46.040 --> 01:56:48.560]   that's why people take nicotinamide,
[01:56:48.560 --> 01:56:49.880]   that's why people are trying to improve
[01:56:49.880 --> 01:56:51.400]   the hydration status of their skin.
[01:56:51.400 --> 01:56:54.060]   So if you're somebody that's vaping nicotine
[01:56:54.060 --> 01:56:56.520]   or even taking nicotine in some other form,
[01:56:56.520 --> 01:56:57.800]   pouch or smoking nicotine,
[01:56:57.800 --> 01:57:00.480]   and you're interested in having youthful appearing skin,
[01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:03.960]   you are really shooting yourself in the, I don't know, face.
[01:57:03.960 --> 01:57:06.520]   And as we all know, our emotions impact the appearance
[01:57:06.520 --> 01:57:09.960]   of our skin, and yes, it can exacerbate so-called breakouts.
[01:57:09.960 --> 01:57:11.420]   And we'll get to that in a moment
[01:57:11.420 --> 01:57:13.240]   as to what the exact pathway is.
[01:57:13.240 --> 01:57:16.140]   But I've done entire episodes about controlling your stress.
[01:57:16.140 --> 01:57:18.400]   We have a master stress episode
[01:57:18.400 --> 01:57:20.720]   that talks about real-time tools that you can use,
[01:57:20.720 --> 01:57:22.480]   like the physiological psi.
[01:57:22.480 --> 01:57:24.820]   Provide a link to a clip about the physiological psi,
[01:57:24.820 --> 01:57:26.840]   it's the fastest way that I'm aware of
[01:57:26.840 --> 01:57:28.560]   to reduce one's levels of stress.
[01:57:28.560 --> 01:57:30.240]   This is something my laboratory has studied
[01:57:30.240 --> 01:57:32.980]   in detail at Stanford.
[01:57:32.980 --> 01:57:34.000]   There are also things you can do,
[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:35.740]   and we're all aware of what they are,
[01:57:35.740 --> 01:57:38.800]   proper sleep, meditation, non-sleep deep rest.
[01:57:38.800 --> 01:57:39.800]   We'll provide a link for that.
[01:57:39.800 --> 01:57:42.360]   All things that we can do that are zero cost,
[01:57:42.360 --> 01:57:44.140]   very minimal time investment.
[01:57:44.140 --> 01:57:46.700]   Physiological psi takes about 10 to 15 seconds.
[01:57:46.700 --> 01:57:51.760]   Non-sleep deep rest, aka yoga nidra, sometimes called,
[01:57:51.760 --> 01:57:53.880]   takes anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes per day.
[01:57:53.880 --> 01:57:57.400]   And that reduced stress can dramatically improve
[01:57:57.400 --> 01:58:00.160]   not just the health, but the appearance of your skin.
[01:58:00.160 --> 01:58:01.960]   And it makes perfect sense as to why that is.
[01:58:01.960 --> 01:58:04.120]   The stress hormones such as cortisol,
[01:58:04.120 --> 01:58:07.120]   but other hormones too, such as adrenaline,
[01:58:07.120 --> 01:58:09.560]   when they are chronically elevated,
[01:58:09.560 --> 01:58:12.040]   because of the fact that adrenaline impacts
[01:58:12.040 --> 01:58:13.920]   vasoconstriction in the skin,
[01:58:13.920 --> 01:58:17.240]   it's gonna reduce blood flow to the periphery, to the skin.
[01:58:17.240 --> 01:58:18.520]   It can cause all sorts of issues
[01:58:18.520 --> 01:58:20.760]   at the level of nerve endings that can lead to,
[01:58:20.760 --> 01:58:22.120]   believe it or not, enhanced flushing
[01:58:22.120 --> 01:58:23.360]   when we're under stress.
[01:58:23.360 --> 01:58:26.320]   This is why we measure the galvanic skin response.
[01:58:26.320 --> 01:58:28.740]   So not just sweating, but also blood flow
[01:58:28.740 --> 01:58:31.160]   and other things to the skin when we are studying stress.
[01:58:31.160 --> 01:58:32.540]   Okay, so direct relationship
[01:58:32.540 --> 01:58:34.200]   between stress and skin appearance.
[01:58:34.200 --> 01:58:35.400]   Learn to control your stress.
[01:58:35.400 --> 01:58:36.240]   Stress is part of life,
[01:58:36.240 --> 01:58:38.520]   but learn to control your stress in real time
[01:58:38.520 --> 01:58:40.620]   and through tools like non-sleep deep rest
[01:58:40.620 --> 01:58:42.080]   that are zero cost that can help you
[01:58:42.080 --> 01:58:45.360]   reduce your overall levels of stress, get great sleep.
[01:58:45.360 --> 01:58:46.200]   Don't use nicotine.
[01:58:46.200 --> 01:58:48.240]   If you do use nicotine, know what you're doing.
[01:58:48.240 --> 01:58:50.320]   Maybe use it sparingly and please don't smoke or vape it,
[01:58:50.320 --> 01:58:51.480]   dip it or snuff it.
[01:58:51.480 --> 01:58:53.680]   There are other forms and I don't recommend those forms
[01:58:53.680 --> 01:58:55.480]   because they're very addictive.
[01:58:55.480 --> 01:58:57.880]   And keep in mind that things that improve blood flow,
[01:58:57.880 --> 01:59:01.080]   reduce inflammation, give you lower stress, better sleep,
[01:59:01.080 --> 01:59:03.240]   all of that is going to make you look more youthful.
[01:59:03.240 --> 01:59:05.980]   It's not an imagined effect, it is real.
[01:59:05.980 --> 01:59:07.400]   Let's talk about acne.
[01:59:07.400 --> 01:59:08.920]   Acne is very common.
[01:59:08.920 --> 01:59:11.120]   It impacts anywhere from 80 to 90%
[01:59:11.120 --> 01:59:12.920]   of young people at some point.
[01:59:12.920 --> 01:59:16.280]   Some people get very bad cystic acne,
[01:59:16.280 --> 01:59:17.720]   you know, deep acne in the cheeks,
[01:59:17.720 --> 01:59:19.120]   on the back of the neck, the back,
[01:59:19.120 --> 01:59:21.000]   it can be very uncomfortable, very painful.
[01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:24.160]   Some people only get the occasional pimple,
[01:59:24.160 --> 01:59:26.400]   but they get them very deeply, they're very painful.
[01:59:26.400 --> 01:59:28.640]   And look, nobody likes acne.
[01:59:28.640 --> 01:59:31.660]   Nobody likes the appearance of acne on themselves.
[01:59:31.660 --> 01:59:33.360]   It can be very distressing for people,
[01:59:33.360 --> 01:59:36.120]   can cause additional stress that then feeds back
[01:59:36.120 --> 01:59:37.560]   in terms of inflammation.
[01:59:37.560 --> 01:59:40.960]   And, you know, I guess my first, you know, request,
[01:59:40.960 --> 01:59:43.420]   I suppose, I can't tell people what to do and never do,
[01:59:43.420 --> 01:59:45.300]   but, you know, for people that have acne, you know,
[01:59:45.300 --> 01:59:46.640]   be compassionate, okay?
[01:59:46.640 --> 01:59:47.720]   Young people, be compassionate.
[01:59:47.720 --> 01:59:48.680]   I remember when I was younger,
[01:59:48.680 --> 01:59:50.400]   some of the kids with bad acne got teased
[01:59:50.400 --> 01:59:51.920]   and it really upset me.
[01:59:51.920 --> 01:59:53.320]   It was really frustrating,
[01:59:53.320 --> 01:59:54.520]   especially when going through puberty
[01:59:54.520 --> 01:59:56.760]   because there's this hormonal component to acne.
[01:59:56.760 --> 01:59:57.880]   Now, fortunately, there are things
[01:59:57.880 --> 01:59:58.760]   that we can do for acne.
[01:59:58.760 --> 02:00:01.480]   I'll provide a link to one of the major sources I used
[02:00:01.480 --> 02:00:03.600]   for researching this episode.
[02:00:03.600 --> 02:00:05.400]   I also, of course, spoke to dermatologists,
[02:00:05.400 --> 02:00:08.920]   one of whom really knows an exceptional amount about acne
[02:00:08.920 --> 02:00:11.980]   and its relationship to the immune system.
[02:00:11.980 --> 02:00:14.560]   The paper that I'm referring to now
[02:00:14.560 --> 02:00:16.920]   is a systematic review and network meta-analysis
[02:00:16.920 --> 02:00:19.400]   of topical, pharmacological, oral pharmacological,
[02:00:19.400 --> 02:00:22.720]   physical, and combined treatments for acne vulgaris,
[02:00:22.720 --> 02:00:25.160]   which is the technical name for acne.
[02:00:25.160 --> 02:00:27.440]   There are a lot of things that impact acne.
[02:00:27.440 --> 02:00:30.240]   Let's just briefly talk about what acne is.
[02:00:30.240 --> 02:00:31.280]   Anytime you talk about acne,
[02:00:31.280 --> 02:00:33.520]   you're usually thinking about pus or oil.
[02:00:33.520 --> 02:00:34.560]   That's called sebum.
[02:00:34.560 --> 02:00:36.800]   The sebum accumulates in, essentially,
[02:00:36.800 --> 02:00:38.640]   the follicle around the hair.
[02:00:38.640 --> 02:00:40.800]   This also occurs on non-hairy skin
[02:00:40.800 --> 02:00:42.180]   or where there's just tiny little hairs
[02:00:42.180 --> 02:00:44.720]   that often aren't visible.
[02:00:44.720 --> 02:00:47.560]   That's why it's very unusual to get acne
[02:00:47.560 --> 02:00:49.540]   on, say, the glabrous skin of the palms.
[02:00:49.540 --> 02:00:51.640]   I suppose it could happen, but it's very rare.
[02:00:51.640 --> 02:00:54.320]   At any given moment, 10% of people worldwide
[02:00:54.320 --> 02:00:55.280]   will have acne.
[02:00:55.280 --> 02:00:58.000]   As I mentioned, up to 90% of young people have acne,
[02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.160]   so very common, very distressing.
[02:01:00.160 --> 02:01:02.400]   The accumulation of that sebum in the follicle
[02:01:02.400 --> 02:01:04.480]   can be due to a number of different things.
[02:01:04.480 --> 02:01:06.900]   Some of it can be related to androgens,
[02:01:06.900 --> 02:01:08.600]   things like testosterone,
[02:01:08.600 --> 02:01:12.040]   increasing the amount of sebum that's produced, okay?
[02:01:12.040 --> 02:01:14.240]   This is why you often see acne during puberty.
[02:01:14.240 --> 02:01:17.640]   In addition, the anabolic, the pro-growth effects
[02:01:17.640 --> 02:01:20.720]   of androgens, such as testosterone,
[02:01:20.720 --> 02:01:23.780]   and by the way, these occur in both males and females
[02:01:23.780 --> 02:01:26.200]   because both males and females have testosterone
[02:01:26.200 --> 02:01:27.040]   and estrogen.
[02:01:27.040 --> 02:01:30.200]   The androgenic effects of testosterone
[02:01:30.200 --> 02:01:33.880]   can also cause hypertrophy growth of the hair follicle,
[02:01:33.880 --> 02:01:36.960]   right, so an increase in the number of keratinocytes,
[02:01:36.960 --> 02:01:39.580]   the cells in and around the follicle,
[02:01:39.580 --> 02:01:41.400]   which can compress that and hold some of that
[02:01:41.400 --> 02:01:43.640]   additional sebum beneath the surface,
[02:01:43.640 --> 02:01:45.320]   and that's why you're getting a swelling
[02:01:45.320 --> 02:01:47.280]   of what looks like a pimple or a cyst.
[02:01:47.280 --> 02:01:50.080]   So there's the potential for a hormonal influence
[02:01:50.080 --> 02:01:51.440]   on increasing acne.
[02:01:51.440 --> 02:01:53.200]   Now, if someone's going through puberty,
[02:01:53.200 --> 02:01:55.960]   you just have to deal with that increase.
[02:01:55.960 --> 02:01:58.040]   If there's a sudden increase in acne
[02:01:58.040 --> 02:01:59.880]   when one is post-puberty,
[02:01:59.880 --> 02:02:01.940]   you may want to look at levels of androgens
[02:02:01.940 --> 02:02:02.780]   that are being produced.
[02:02:02.780 --> 02:02:05.820]   And nowadays, with increasing numbers, apparently,
[02:02:05.820 --> 02:02:08.040]   of things like polycystic ovarian syndrome,
[02:02:08.040 --> 02:02:10.840]   which in part relates to increases in androgens,
[02:02:10.840 --> 02:02:12.620]   this is becoming an additional concern.
[02:02:12.620 --> 02:02:14.480]   So getting a quality blood test,
[02:02:14.480 --> 02:02:16.520]   looking at androgen levels over time
[02:02:16.520 --> 02:02:19.220]   can be very beneficial for both males and females.
[02:02:19.220 --> 02:02:24.220]   Now, in addition, insulin that is related to our diet.
[02:02:24.220 --> 02:02:27.260]   So insulin and glucose generally go up together
[02:02:27.260 --> 02:02:28.860]   or down together, depending on whether or not
[02:02:28.860 --> 02:02:31.460]   we're ingesting foods or amounts of foods
[02:02:31.460 --> 02:02:34.260]   that greatly increase our insulin and blood glucose.
[02:02:34.260 --> 02:02:37.020]   So insulin is part of an anabolic pathway as well,
[02:02:37.020 --> 02:02:39.260]   a cell growth pathway, pro-growth pathway,
[02:02:39.260 --> 02:02:41.700]   we should call it, that involves mTOR,
[02:02:41.700 --> 02:02:44.300]   mammalian target of rapamycin,
[02:02:44.300 --> 02:02:47.700]   that is a general growth signal for cells.
[02:02:47.700 --> 02:02:51.180]   So this occurs in the eye, this occurs in the liver,
[02:02:51.180 --> 02:02:53.500]   mTOR is involved in growth of cells of all kinds,
[02:02:53.500 --> 02:02:55.820]   including cells within the skin.
[02:02:55.820 --> 02:03:00.820]   When our diet increases the amount of insulin and glucose
[02:03:00.820 --> 02:03:04.340]   to a degree that is in excess of some threshold,
[02:03:04.340 --> 02:03:05.740]   that's going to be different for everybody,
[02:03:05.740 --> 02:03:07.920]   depending on your activity levels, your metabolism,
[02:03:07.920 --> 02:03:09.420]   the way you manage insulin.
[02:03:09.420 --> 02:03:11.220]   When that happens, you get increases in mTOR
[02:03:11.220 --> 02:03:13.780]   that then can feed back on those androgen receptors,
[02:03:13.780 --> 02:03:17.160]   increase the levels of things like testosterone further,
[02:03:17.160 --> 02:03:22.160]   that then feed back on the production of increased sebum,
[02:03:22.160 --> 02:03:23.740]   okay, that oily stuff,
[02:03:23.740 --> 02:03:26.780]   increased keratinocyte proliferation,
[02:03:26.780 --> 02:03:28.480]   and you get more acne.
[02:03:28.480 --> 02:03:32.260]   In other words, having a diet that has a high glycemic load
[02:03:32.260 --> 02:03:37.060]   or evokes a large insulin response can be problematic.
[02:03:37.060 --> 02:03:38.180]   So what to do?
[02:03:38.180 --> 02:03:39.300]   Well, we talked about it before,
[02:03:39.300 --> 02:03:40.780]   you wanna eat mostly non-processed,
[02:03:40.780 --> 02:03:41.820]   minimally processed foods,
[02:03:41.820 --> 02:03:44.100]   you definitely wanna exert portion control, right?
[02:03:44.100 --> 02:03:47.360]   You don't wanna eat much sugar or sugar in excess,
[02:03:47.360 --> 02:03:50.520]   you don't want big spikes in insulin and blood glucose,
[02:03:50.520 --> 02:03:52.860]   you want to avoid an inflammatory diet.
[02:03:52.860 --> 02:03:56.260]   So again, fewer, if any, highly processed foods
[02:03:56.260 --> 02:03:58.320]   because of those glycation end products
[02:03:58.320 --> 02:03:59.640]   that we talked about before.
[02:03:59.640 --> 02:04:01.920]   And on the positive side,
[02:04:01.920 --> 02:04:05.020]   if one exercises something like say intermittent fasting,
[02:04:05.020 --> 02:04:06.720]   and here I don't necessarily think young people,
[02:04:06.720 --> 02:04:09.040]   especially people going through puberty should do this
[02:04:09.040 --> 02:04:10.760]   because they're growing, they need nutrients,
[02:04:10.760 --> 02:04:11.840]   so you have to strike that balance
[02:04:11.840 --> 02:04:13.160]   between getting enough nutrients
[02:04:13.160 --> 02:04:14.500]   and not overloading the system
[02:04:14.500 --> 02:04:16.340]   with insulin, glucose, and calories.
[02:04:16.340 --> 02:04:19.080]   But things like intermittent fasting could be useful,
[02:04:19.080 --> 02:04:21.800]   or making sure that if you ingest complex carbohydrates,
[02:04:21.800 --> 02:04:24.600]   as I mentioned, I do, okay, I'm an omnivore,
[02:04:24.600 --> 02:04:26.080]   that you don't do it in excess
[02:04:26.080 --> 02:04:28.120]   to the point where you're getting big spikes in insulin
[02:04:28.120 --> 02:04:28.960]   and blood glucose.
[02:04:28.960 --> 02:04:30.960]   All of this, the dermatologists tell me,
[02:04:30.960 --> 02:04:33.480]   can help serve to reduce acne.
[02:04:33.480 --> 02:04:35.580]   And while it might seem indirect,
[02:04:35.580 --> 02:04:37.440]   you know, this relationship between testosterone
[02:04:37.440 --> 02:04:39.120]   and sebum accumulation,
[02:04:39.120 --> 02:04:41.960]   the relationship between insulin and mTOR
[02:04:41.960 --> 02:04:45.720]   and increased testosterone and sebum accumulation
[02:04:45.720 --> 02:04:47.560]   and growth of the keratinocytes,
[02:04:47.560 --> 02:04:49.440]   these are real pathways that have been established.
[02:04:49.440 --> 02:04:52.160]   And some of those are discussed in detail in the review.
[02:04:52.160 --> 02:04:55.320]   So much so that there has been the exploration
[02:04:55.320 --> 02:04:58.680]   of specific foods, in particular dairy and whey.
[02:04:58.680 --> 02:05:00.960]   You know, we hear a lot about ingestion of whey protein.
[02:05:00.960 --> 02:05:04.240]   It's a very high quality protein, high bioavailability,
[02:05:04.240 --> 02:05:06.480]   high in the amino acid leucine,
[02:05:06.480 --> 02:05:08.160]   which for those of you that are interested
[02:05:08.160 --> 02:05:10.160]   in muscle building and repair,
[02:05:10.160 --> 02:05:11.520]   there's a lot of discussion about leucine
[02:05:11.520 --> 02:05:12.680]   being a critical component there.
[02:05:12.680 --> 02:05:13.740]   You want leucine.
[02:05:13.740 --> 02:05:17.320]   But it does appear that people that over-consume whey,
[02:05:17.320 --> 02:05:21.080]   people that over-consume dairy can run into issues.
[02:05:21.080 --> 02:05:23.080]   Now, does that mean you shouldn't consume whey protein?
[02:05:23.080 --> 02:05:25.440]   No, I take whey protein.
[02:05:25.440 --> 02:05:26.480]   Do I suffer from acne?
[02:05:26.480 --> 02:05:27.320]   No.
[02:05:27.320 --> 02:05:29.540]   If I did, would I reduce my whey protein intake?
[02:05:29.540 --> 02:05:31.880]   Well, I might decide to run a bit of an experiment
[02:05:31.880 --> 02:05:33.380]   where I reduce the amount of whey protein
[02:05:33.380 --> 02:05:36.040]   that I eat for a little bit and see how that goes.
[02:05:36.040 --> 02:05:38.120]   Should I reduce the amount of dairy I ingest?
[02:05:38.120 --> 02:05:40.440]   Ah, well, here's where things get interesting.
[02:05:40.440 --> 02:05:43.000]   So in discussing this with a dermatologist
[02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:45.240]   who also happens to know a lot about nutrition,
[02:05:45.240 --> 02:05:47.120]   they told me something very interesting.
[02:05:47.120 --> 02:05:50.020]   A lot of people think that high-fat dairy
[02:05:50.020 --> 02:05:54.060]   will exacerbate their acne, but here's the situation.
[02:05:54.060 --> 02:05:59.200]   Non-fat and low-fat dairy has emulsifiers,
[02:05:59.200 --> 02:06:00.480]   this is actually based on work I believe,
[02:06:00.480 --> 02:06:02.120]   some of which was done at Stanford,
[02:06:02.120 --> 02:06:05.140]   that can spike insulin more than full-fat dairy.
[02:06:05.140 --> 02:06:07.360]   So some people, in an attempt to reduce
[02:06:07.360 --> 02:06:09.040]   the amount of acne they're getting,
[02:06:09.040 --> 02:06:12.880]   will move from high-fat dairy, or full-fat I should say,
[02:06:12.880 --> 02:06:16.320]   to non-fat milk, or non-fat dairy, or low-fat dairy,
[02:06:16.320 --> 02:06:18.040]   and their acne will actually get worse,
[02:06:18.040 --> 02:06:20.400]   and that could be because of the insulin spike
[02:06:20.400 --> 02:06:21.960]   associated with some of the emulsifiers
[02:06:21.960 --> 02:06:24.100]   in that non-fat and low-fat dairy.
[02:06:24.100 --> 02:06:25.660]   So what this means is that you don't have
[02:06:25.660 --> 02:06:28.040]   to avoid dairy altogether, but you might be better off
[02:06:28.040 --> 02:06:30.000]   ingesting full-fat dairy.
[02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:33.020]   You might be best off not ingesting any dairy at all,
[02:06:33.020 --> 02:06:34.960]   maybe you want to run that experiment on yourself
[02:06:34.960 --> 02:06:37.280]   and just see what works and what doesn't work,
[02:06:37.280 --> 02:06:38.640]   or if there's no change at all.
[02:06:38.640 --> 02:06:40.860]   In addition, if you're consuming a lot of fried foods,
[02:06:40.860 --> 02:06:43.240]   so those French fries, you're ingesting cheeseburgers
[02:06:43.240 --> 02:06:45.440]   and things of that sort, it may not be so much
[02:06:45.440 --> 02:06:47.000]   the fat content of those meals,
[02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.360]   but rather the big insulin response that occurs
[02:06:49.360 --> 02:06:51.880]   when we ingest high-fat meals in combination
[02:06:51.880 --> 02:06:55.380]   with things like sugary milkshakes, or fried foods,
[02:06:55.380 --> 02:06:57.040]   like French fries and things of that sort,
[02:06:57.040 --> 02:07:01.040]   that's leading to the acne by way of increased inflammation.
[02:07:01.040 --> 02:07:03.040]   All right, so there are a lot of different pathways,
[02:07:03.040 --> 02:07:06.200]   inflammation, androgens like testosterone,
[02:07:06.200 --> 02:07:08.440]   insulin leading to increases in testosterone
[02:07:08.440 --> 02:07:11.200]   and inflammation, a lot of pathways converge
[02:07:11.200 --> 02:07:14.600]   to exacerbate acne, and oftentimes it's just the removal
[02:07:14.600 --> 02:07:17.760]   or even just the reduction of some of this food intake
[02:07:17.760 --> 02:07:19.920]   or types of food intake that can really lead
[02:07:19.920 --> 02:07:22.760]   to big improvements in one's acne.
[02:07:22.760 --> 02:07:24.480]   So all of these things combined to support
[02:07:24.480 --> 02:07:27.480]   lower inflammation, appropriate amounts of sebum production,
[02:07:27.480 --> 02:07:29.240]   because you do need sebum production,
[02:07:29.240 --> 02:07:32.080]   you do need keratinocytes in and around the hair follicle,
[02:07:32.080 --> 02:07:34.440]   but you don't want too many of them, and so on.
[02:07:34.440 --> 02:07:36.860]   But what can be done to directly address acne?
[02:07:36.860 --> 02:07:38.240]   Well, there are a number of different prescription
[02:07:38.240 --> 02:07:40.500]   treatments that your dermatologist can suggest,
[02:07:40.500 --> 02:07:43.520]   but one thing that all the dermatologists agree upon
[02:07:43.520 --> 02:07:47.600]   is, first of all, getting adequate sleep, reducing stress,
[02:07:47.600 --> 02:07:49.200]   taking care of your gut microbiome,
[02:07:49.200 --> 02:07:51.800]   the nutrition recommendations that we've been talking
[02:07:51.800 --> 02:07:54.520]   about up until now, but also, get this,
[02:07:54.520 --> 02:07:57.320]   this is interesting, not over-cleansing.
[02:07:57.320 --> 02:07:58.800]   A lot of people with acne will start
[02:07:58.800 --> 02:08:01.280]   to wash their face constantly and will often use
[02:08:01.280 --> 02:08:03.720]   harsh cleansers that can exacerbate that acne,
[02:08:03.720 --> 02:08:08.660]   either by virtue of removing some important skin microbiome
[02:08:08.660 --> 02:08:11.980]   components that then lead to even other infections
[02:08:11.980 --> 02:08:14.740]   like fungal infections or additional inflammation,
[02:08:14.740 --> 02:08:17.340]   'cause you're removing that microbiome barrier,
[02:08:17.340 --> 02:08:20.700]   but they all recommend regular cleansing of the skin,
[02:08:20.700 --> 02:08:22.580]   usually two or three times per day,
[02:08:22.580 --> 02:08:26.340]   but not in excess of that, using a gentle, unscented,
[02:08:26.340 --> 02:08:29.060]   unfragranced cleanser, okay?
[02:08:29.060 --> 02:08:30.660]   So there are a number of different types of these.
[02:08:30.660 --> 02:08:33.060]   I personally, basically my entire life
[02:08:33.060 --> 02:08:34.900]   that I, at least as far as I can remember,
[02:08:34.900 --> 02:08:38.380]   I've always used unscented, unfragranced dove soap, okay?
[02:08:38.380 --> 02:08:39.840]   I have no relationship to dove soap.
[02:08:39.840 --> 02:08:41.420]   I'm sure people out there are going to say,
[02:08:41.420 --> 02:08:43.260]   "Oh my goodness, you know, it contains a bunch of things
[02:08:43.260 --> 02:08:45.380]   that are bad for you," but that's what's worked for me
[02:08:45.380 --> 02:08:48.020]   and not the liquid form, just bar soap,
[02:08:48.020 --> 02:08:49.820]   and there are things like Cetaphil,
[02:08:49.820 --> 02:08:51.380]   these are some brand names, and there are a bunch
[02:08:51.380 --> 02:08:53.760]   of other more sophisticated, gentle cleansers
[02:08:53.760 --> 02:08:54.780]   that one could use.
[02:08:54.780 --> 02:08:56.300]   There are also a lot of products out there
[02:08:56.300 --> 02:08:59.280]   that contain what's called salicylic acid, okay?
[02:08:59.280 --> 02:09:02.180]   This is often as, you know, a clear fluid
[02:09:02.180 --> 02:09:03.940]   that you put onto a cotton ball or a tissue
[02:09:03.940 --> 02:09:05.580]   and then you spread on the face.
[02:09:05.580 --> 02:09:07.580]   It's very important, very, very important
[02:09:07.580 --> 02:09:09.740]   that if you're going to use these products
[02:09:09.740 --> 02:09:11.500]   that you do it on clean skin,
[02:09:11.500 --> 02:09:13.340]   that is skin that's been cleaned
[02:09:13.340 --> 02:09:18.340]   with a combination of mild, zero-fragrance soap
[02:09:18.340 --> 02:09:22.060]   and lukewarm water, okay?
[02:09:22.060 --> 02:09:24.620]   Because of the relationship between inflammation and acne,
[02:09:24.620 --> 02:09:26.660]   that's what gives it its red appearance.
[02:09:26.660 --> 02:09:29.060]   You don't want to use extreme temperatures
[02:09:29.060 --> 02:09:32.580]   of especially hot water when washing your skin.
[02:09:32.580 --> 02:09:35.820]   So lukewarm water, mild soap, and then,
[02:09:35.820 --> 02:09:38.180]   and only if it's been recommended by your dermatologist,
[02:09:38.180 --> 02:09:39.500]   the salicylic acid.
[02:09:39.500 --> 02:09:41.940]   Salicylic acid comes from the same class of drugs
[02:09:41.940 --> 02:09:46.020]   as aspirin, so it tends to reduce keratinocyte stickiness,
[02:09:46.020 --> 02:09:49.220]   right, the extent to which those cells stick together.
[02:09:49.220 --> 02:09:50.260]   Why do I mention aspirin?
[02:09:50.260 --> 02:09:51.660]   Well, you may have heard that some people
[02:09:51.660 --> 02:09:53.440]   will take aspirin to reduce the stickiness
[02:09:53.440 --> 02:09:55.800]   between their platelets in an attempt to improve heart health.
[02:09:55.800 --> 02:09:58.600]   We'll cover that on another episode at some point.
[02:09:58.600 --> 02:10:01.720]   But salicylic acid reduces the stickiness
[02:10:01.720 --> 02:10:04.820]   of the keratinocytes, so it can lead to less clogging
[02:10:04.820 --> 02:10:07.060]   of the pores by accumulation of keratinocytes,
[02:10:07.060 --> 02:10:10.100]   or I should say by less accumulation of the keratinocytes,
[02:10:10.100 --> 02:10:13.220]   and it can reduce swelling in and around the area
[02:10:13.220 --> 02:10:14.460]   related to the acne.
[02:10:14.460 --> 02:10:16.560]   Sometimes if people get an acne pimple,
[02:10:16.560 --> 02:10:17.740]   especially if they have an event
[02:10:17.740 --> 02:10:20.420]   or they don't want to be seen with that pimple,
[02:10:20.420 --> 02:10:23.020]   the use of a little bit of corticosterone cream
[02:10:23.020 --> 02:10:25.780]   put on there can reduce the redness or swelling.
[02:10:25.780 --> 02:10:27.760]   The dermatologists tell me you should
[02:10:27.760 --> 02:10:29.960]   absolutely not pop your pimples.
[02:10:29.960 --> 02:10:32.240]   Part of the problem when you pop a pimple,
[02:10:32.240 --> 02:10:35.240]   I know there are entire videos about this online.
[02:10:35.240 --> 02:10:36.920]   I know, please don't go look at them.
[02:10:36.920 --> 02:10:40.040]   The whole community is around this, it's super gross.
[02:10:40.040 --> 02:10:42.720]   But I know people find it very satisfying in some cases
[02:10:42.720 --> 02:10:45.020]   to pop these pimples, get the infection out.
[02:10:45.020 --> 02:10:46.920]   While there are certain use cases for that
[02:10:46.920 --> 02:10:48.100]   where someone has an infection,
[02:10:48.100 --> 02:10:49.440]   it just absolutely needs to get out,
[02:10:49.440 --> 02:10:51.960]   then be cleaned, then covered with a bandage
[02:10:51.960 --> 02:10:53.640]   and maybe some topical antibiotic,
[02:10:53.640 --> 02:10:55.400]   that would be a use case for that.
[02:10:55.400 --> 02:10:57.580]   The dermatologist practically begged me
[02:10:57.580 --> 02:10:59.700]   to tell you don't pop your pimples
[02:10:59.700 --> 02:11:03.780]   because A, they will go away in not too much time
[02:11:03.780 --> 02:11:04.740]   if you leave them alone,
[02:11:04.740 --> 02:11:06.980]   and B, you can always put a little bit
[02:11:06.980 --> 02:11:08.720]   of corticosterone cream on top of them
[02:11:08.720 --> 02:11:10.780]   to reduce the redness or swelling.
[02:11:10.780 --> 02:11:12.580]   But most importantly, they tell me
[02:11:12.580 --> 02:11:14.380]   that when you pop those pimples,
[02:11:14.380 --> 02:11:17.260]   what ends up happening is you get a mechanical,
[02:11:17.260 --> 02:11:19.340]   a physical disruption of that area,
[02:11:19.340 --> 02:11:20.900]   which to you might just seem like, okay, whatever,
[02:11:20.900 --> 02:11:22.460]   it turns a little bit red and that's transient,
[02:11:22.460 --> 02:11:24.520]   but you get the influx of what are called
[02:11:24.520 --> 02:11:26.220]   matrix metalloproteases.
[02:11:26.220 --> 02:11:27.620]   These are enzymes, and remember,
[02:11:27.620 --> 02:11:30.020]   anytime you hear an ace, it's usually an enzyme,
[02:11:30.020 --> 02:11:32.420]   matrix metalloproteases that then,
[02:11:32.420 --> 02:11:34.740]   and go eat at the extracellular matrix,
[02:11:34.740 --> 02:11:37.820]   and then you can get an indentation scar
[02:11:37.820 --> 02:11:39.980]   that is permanent, okay?
[02:11:39.980 --> 02:11:42.680]   So if you're concerned about the appearance of your skin,
[02:11:42.680 --> 02:11:44.100]   avoid popping those pimples.
[02:11:44.100 --> 02:11:45.300]   I know it can be hard to do,
[02:11:45.300 --> 02:11:47.540]   but really try and avoid popping pimples.
[02:11:47.540 --> 02:11:48.480]   It can lead to scarring
[02:11:48.480 --> 02:11:50.180]   because of the matrix metalloproteases
[02:11:50.180 --> 02:11:52.660]   and the eating away of the extracellular matrix.
[02:11:52.660 --> 02:11:55.160]   Keep the area clean, cover it up if you need to,
[02:11:55.160 --> 02:11:57.640]   get some corticosterone cream on there
[02:11:57.640 --> 02:11:58.760]   if you want to reduce the redness.
[02:11:58.760 --> 02:12:01.600]   If it's really bad and you have some big important event,
[02:12:01.600 --> 02:12:02.960]   like you're getting married tomorrow
[02:12:02.960 --> 02:12:04.200]   and it's right on the tip of your nose
[02:12:04.200 --> 02:12:05.200]   or something like that,
[02:12:05.200 --> 02:12:07.640]   then you can potentially go to the dermatologist
[02:12:07.640 --> 02:12:09.360]   and get it injected with a corticosteroid
[02:12:09.360 --> 02:12:12.880]   to reduce the redness in a more potent way.
[02:12:12.880 --> 02:12:15.440]   But they did ask that I ask you
[02:12:15.440 --> 02:12:17.960]   to please not pop your pimples.
[02:12:17.960 --> 02:12:20.120]   And if you're somebody that suffers from acne,
[02:12:20.120 --> 02:12:22.120]   I'd like you to know I provide a link to a paper
[02:12:22.120 --> 02:12:25.000]   in the show note captions entitled "Acne and Diet,
[02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:27.640]   A Review of Pathogenic Mechanisms."
[02:12:27.640 --> 02:12:30.280]   And I also provide a link to the review I mentioned before
[02:12:30.280 --> 02:12:33.840]   that covers all of the other aspects of treating acne,
[02:12:33.840 --> 02:12:36.520]   topical, pharmacological, oral, pharmacological,
[02:12:36.520 --> 02:12:39.160]   physical, and combined treatments for acne vulgaris.
[02:12:39.160 --> 02:12:41.800]   Because again, I do sympathize with the fact
[02:12:41.800 --> 02:12:44.520]   that acne can be very distressing, very painful.
[02:12:44.520 --> 02:12:47.000]   Fortunately, there are a number of different avenues
[02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.160]   that you, without a dermatologist,
[02:12:49.160 --> 02:12:51.780]   but ideally you and a dermatologist can use
[02:12:51.780 --> 02:12:54.480]   to attack acne at the level of inflammation,
[02:12:54.480 --> 02:12:56.360]   through diet, through lifestyle,
[02:12:56.360 --> 02:12:58.560]   if needed prescription medications.
[02:12:58.560 --> 02:13:00.880]   And again, gentle cleansing
[02:13:00.880 --> 02:13:03.040]   and thinking about the various things
[02:13:03.040 --> 02:13:04.800]   that indirectly will impact that acne.
[02:13:04.800 --> 02:13:07.640]   So much so that a few of the derms told me
[02:13:07.640 --> 02:13:09.640]   that they have patients young and old
[02:13:09.640 --> 02:13:12.400]   who will be suffering from really bad acne
[02:13:12.400 --> 02:13:14.400]   that will sometimes just make a few adjustments
[02:13:14.400 --> 02:13:16.400]   to their diet, the exclusion of certain things,
[02:13:16.400 --> 02:13:17.760]   mainly highly processed foods,
[02:13:17.760 --> 02:13:20.000]   maybe reducing dairy a little bit
[02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.460]   or weigh a little bit or completely
[02:13:22.460 --> 02:13:24.380]   and increasing the amount of things
[02:13:24.380 --> 02:13:25.420]   that reduce inflammation.
[02:13:25.420 --> 02:13:26.820]   So more fruits and vegetables
[02:13:26.820 --> 02:13:29.140]   and meat, fish, eggs from healthy sources
[02:13:29.140 --> 02:13:31.660]   and seeing dramatic improvements in acne.
[02:13:31.660 --> 02:13:33.540]   So that's always reassuring to hear.
[02:13:33.540 --> 02:13:35.700]   It doesn't always require a prescription medication,
[02:13:35.700 --> 02:13:37.820]   but if you need it, you should take it.
[02:13:37.820 --> 02:13:39.580]   Okay, let's talk about rosacea.
[02:13:39.580 --> 02:13:42.100]   Rosacea is reddening of the skin.
[02:13:42.100 --> 02:13:44.700]   And some people suffer from this pretty severely,
[02:13:44.700 --> 02:13:47.460]   other people mildly, some people transiently,
[02:13:47.460 --> 02:13:49.980]   but it tends to be kind of distressing for people.
[02:13:49.980 --> 02:13:52.180]   And the reason it's distressing is that
[02:13:52.180 --> 02:13:55.580]   it can look like blushing or flushing of the face
[02:13:55.580 --> 02:13:58.440]   when in fact one isn't emotionally embarrassed.
[02:13:58.440 --> 02:14:01.340]   However, being embarrassed or having any flushing
[02:14:01.340 --> 02:14:04.640]   of the skin can exacerbate existing rosacea.
[02:14:04.640 --> 02:14:08.160]   So it's thought to be caused by a combination of genetics.
[02:14:08.160 --> 02:14:10.440]   There can perhaps be some, again,
[02:14:10.440 --> 02:14:12.740]   over-inflammation of the skin,
[02:14:12.740 --> 02:14:16.000]   which probably reflects inflammation more globally
[02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.220]   at the level of the gut and body, et cetera.
[02:14:18.220 --> 02:14:20.180]   We've been talking a lot about that today.
[02:14:20.180 --> 02:14:22.200]   And there are things that can exacerbate rosacea
[02:14:22.200 --> 02:14:25.060]   such as alcohol intake or anything that acts
[02:14:25.060 --> 02:14:27.700]   as a vasodilator that dilates the vasculature
[02:14:27.700 --> 02:14:29.260]   innervating the skin.
[02:14:29.260 --> 02:14:33.160]   So the approach to treating rosacea is pretty much similar
[02:14:33.160 --> 02:14:34.580]   to the other things that we've talked about,
[02:14:34.580 --> 02:14:37.580]   consuming a low inflammation, low glycemic load diet,
[02:14:37.580 --> 02:14:38.940]   trying to get enough sleep,
[02:14:38.940 --> 02:14:42.140]   keeping alcohol intake in particular to a minimum
[02:14:42.140 --> 02:14:44.080]   or cutting out alcohol completely.
[02:14:44.080 --> 02:14:46.480]   The reason I say in particular is that a lot of people
[02:14:46.480 --> 02:14:49.860]   that suffer from rosacea who cut out alcohol completely
[02:14:49.860 --> 02:14:51.580]   essentially eliminate their rosacea
[02:14:51.580 --> 02:14:53.100]   or dramatically reduce it.
[02:14:53.100 --> 02:14:55.300]   So oftentimes it's alcohol that's the culprit
[02:14:55.300 --> 02:14:57.880]   either directly or indirectly, we don't know.
[02:14:57.880 --> 02:14:59.220]   Again, alcohol is a poison,
[02:14:59.220 --> 02:15:01.540]   but it could be the indirect manner
[02:15:01.540 --> 02:15:02.800]   in which alcohol impacts sleep
[02:15:02.800 --> 02:15:04.480]   and the gut microbiome negatively
[02:15:04.480 --> 02:15:06.020]   that's causing the rosacea.
[02:15:06.020 --> 02:15:09.020]   Without knowing the direct or indirect mechanism,
[02:15:09.020 --> 02:15:12.140]   reduce or even eliminate your alcohol for a bit
[02:15:12.140 --> 02:15:14.220]   and see if your rosacea improves.
[02:15:14.220 --> 02:15:15.840]   That will give you a strong indication
[02:15:15.840 --> 02:15:17.980]   of what might be going on and even better,
[02:15:17.980 --> 02:15:20.900]   it could give you a potential solution to the problem.
[02:15:20.900 --> 02:15:23.400]   Now, for those that don't experience a reduction
[02:15:23.400 --> 02:15:26.220]   or elimination of rosacea, if you eliminate alcohol,
[02:15:26.220 --> 02:15:27.820]   get your sleep right, get your diet right,
[02:15:27.820 --> 02:15:29.980]   there are some additional things you can do.
[02:15:29.980 --> 02:15:32.000]   First of all, you want to follow the same recommendation
[02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:33.040]   we talked about for acne,
[02:15:33.040 --> 02:15:35.980]   which is also the general recommendation for skincare.
[02:15:35.980 --> 02:15:39.700]   Use lukewarm water, not excessively hot or cold water,
[02:15:39.700 --> 02:15:42.340]   a gentle unfragrance cleanser.
[02:15:42.340 --> 02:15:43.820]   You want to use sunscreen regularly.
[02:15:43.820 --> 02:15:46.920]   Remember, sun damage to the skin is also inflammation,
[02:15:46.920 --> 02:15:49.420]   so that's going to exacerbate rosacea.
[02:15:49.420 --> 02:15:50.940]   And of course, sunlight,
[02:15:50.940 --> 02:15:52.940]   because of the release of nitric oxide,
[02:15:52.940 --> 02:15:55.160]   is also going to act as a vasodilator.
[02:15:55.160 --> 02:15:57.560]   Does that mean you have to go full beekeeper mode?
[02:15:57.560 --> 02:15:58.480]   No, it doesn't.
[02:15:58.480 --> 02:16:00.320]   You can if you want to, I suppose,
[02:16:00.320 --> 02:16:03.040]   but use a quality mineral-based sunscreen,
[02:16:03.040 --> 02:16:05.320]   which we talked about earlier in the episode.
[02:16:05.320 --> 02:16:08.200]   And you should use some sort of moisturizer
[02:16:08.200 --> 02:16:10.920]   to help lock in the moisture within your skin.
[02:16:10.920 --> 02:16:12.960]   You could use things like hyaluronic acid
[02:16:12.960 --> 02:16:15.960]   or use any kind of gentle moisturizing cream
[02:16:15.960 --> 02:16:17.720]   that's not going to cause inflammation
[02:16:17.720 --> 02:16:20.200]   or kind of irritate the skin in any way
[02:16:20.200 --> 02:16:22.000]   and can keep the moisture within the skin.
[02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:23.200]   And there are a lot of different versions
[02:16:23.200 --> 02:16:24.240]   of these available out there.
[02:16:24.240 --> 02:16:26.640]   And frankly, a lot of them are not terribly expensive.
[02:16:26.640 --> 02:16:28.600]   You can find super expensive varieties
[02:16:28.600 --> 02:16:30.160]   of any and all these things.
[02:16:30.160 --> 02:16:32.240]   But many of the things that meet the criteria
[02:16:32.240 --> 02:16:34.800]   of gentle unfragrance cleanser,
[02:16:34.800 --> 02:16:38.000]   SPF 30 mineral-only sunscreen,
[02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:39.760]   as well as a quality moisturizer
[02:16:39.760 --> 02:16:42.460]   are not necessarily the most expensive available.
[02:16:42.460 --> 02:16:45.800]   And what justifies the higher expense in some cases
[02:16:45.800 --> 02:16:49.480]   could be, I don't know, the silkiness or the packaging.
[02:16:49.480 --> 02:16:50.760]   It could be any number of different things.
[02:16:50.760 --> 02:16:53.360]   I'm not going to say that the cheapest varieties
[02:16:53.360 --> 02:16:55.960]   are necessarily as good as the most expensive varieties,
[02:16:55.960 --> 02:16:59.640]   but I do think, and the dermatologist that I spoke to
[02:16:59.640 --> 02:17:02.100]   definitely confirmed that there's a lot of price inflation
[02:17:02.100 --> 02:17:05.800]   out there related to kind of the overall milieu of packaging
[02:17:05.800 --> 02:17:09.320]   and purported exclusivity of certain skincare products.
[02:17:09.320 --> 02:17:12.040]   Look for the things that meet the criteria.
[02:17:12.040 --> 02:17:14.900]   You are trying to establish for your skincare.
[02:17:14.900 --> 02:17:18.340]   But just like with acne, just like with general skincare,
[02:17:18.340 --> 02:17:19.660]   if you have rosacea,
[02:17:19.660 --> 02:17:21.860]   you want to think about mild treatments for the skin
[02:17:21.860 --> 02:17:24.540]   at the level of cleaning, at the level of sun protection,
[02:17:24.540 --> 02:17:26.660]   at the level of locking in moisture.
[02:17:26.660 --> 02:17:28.020]   And then there's some additional things
[02:17:28.020 --> 02:17:32.420]   that if you can spare the expense could also be beneficial
[02:17:32.420 --> 02:17:36.300]   like nicotinamide, niacinamide, as it's also called.
[02:17:36.300 --> 02:17:38.140]   Or there's also been some evidence
[02:17:38.140 --> 02:17:40.840]   that things like licorice root can be a benefit, okay?
[02:17:40.840 --> 02:17:43.380]   These things are typically found as a topical ointment
[02:17:43.380 --> 02:17:45.220]   or in a topical ointment.
[02:17:45.220 --> 02:17:47.820]   But in the case of niacinamide, nicotinamide,
[02:17:47.820 --> 02:17:49.220]   we talked about how this can be available
[02:17:49.220 --> 02:17:51.420]   in an ointment form, a topical form,
[02:17:51.420 --> 02:17:55.300]   or it can be taken as two 500 milligram dosages per day.
[02:17:55.300 --> 02:17:58.040]   I gave you the long list of the various mechanisms
[02:17:58.040 --> 02:18:01.260]   by which it can improve skin health, reduced inflammation,
[02:18:01.260 --> 02:18:03.380]   production of collagen, et cetera.
[02:18:03.380 --> 02:18:04.660]   All of that still holds
[02:18:04.660 --> 02:18:07.180]   for the potential treatment of rosacea.
[02:18:07.180 --> 02:18:09.020]   Be sure to avoid any kind of things
[02:18:09.020 --> 02:18:12.040]   that are acting as strong astringents or that increase heat.
[02:18:12.040 --> 02:18:14.240]   So people who have rosacea
[02:18:14.240 --> 02:18:16.920]   will often try to avoid hot peppers.
[02:18:16.920 --> 02:18:19.600]   So spicy foods of any kind, I know that's tough.
[02:18:19.600 --> 02:18:21.440]   I'm somebody who really enjoys spicy foods.
[02:18:21.440 --> 02:18:25.240]   So if you have to avoid spicy foods, I sympathize with you.
[02:18:25.240 --> 02:18:27.560]   That's rough.
[02:18:27.560 --> 02:18:29.400]   Anything that acts as an astringent
[02:18:29.400 --> 02:18:31.840]   or can really irritate the skin
[02:18:31.840 --> 02:18:33.760]   from the inside or from the outside.
[02:18:33.760 --> 02:18:36.600]   So think not excessively hot foods
[02:18:36.600 --> 02:18:38.880]   as it relates to spicy or temperature.
[02:18:38.880 --> 02:18:39.940]   Things of that sort.
[02:18:39.940 --> 02:18:40.900]   Now, I should point out
[02:18:40.900 --> 02:18:43.420]   there are different types of rosacea.
[02:18:43.420 --> 02:18:46.700]   The dermatologist I spoke to who is expert in rosacea
[02:18:46.700 --> 02:18:49.820]   told me there are four major types of rosacea.
[02:18:49.820 --> 02:18:52.260]   Many of them respond to the sorts of guidelines
[02:18:52.260 --> 02:18:54.620]   that we've been talking about up until now.
[02:18:54.620 --> 02:18:56.580]   Some of them that also include acne
[02:18:56.580 --> 02:18:58.580]   need some additional treatment.
[02:18:58.580 --> 02:18:59.700]   Talked about acne treatments
[02:18:59.700 --> 02:19:04.000]   that can be easily folded into the treatment for rosacea.
[02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.700]   There are people who have very stubborn rosaceas.
[02:19:06.700 --> 02:19:10.200]   This may be due to excessive use of cleansers.
[02:19:10.200 --> 02:19:12.480]   And again, we're talking about how over cleansing
[02:19:12.480 --> 02:19:13.440]   can really be a problem.
[02:19:13.440 --> 02:19:15.520]   So we're not saying don't wash your face.
[02:19:15.520 --> 02:19:17.320]   We're not saying don't take a shower, please do.
[02:19:17.320 --> 02:19:19.680]   In fact, and I should have said this earlier, by the way,
[02:19:19.680 --> 02:19:22.960]   for a lot of reasons related to your comfort and appearance
[02:19:22.960 --> 02:19:24.320]   and other people's comfort.
[02:19:24.320 --> 02:19:27.240]   After you work out at a gym,
[02:19:27.240 --> 02:19:28.960]   regardless of whether or not you're rolling around
[02:19:28.960 --> 02:19:30.960]   on the floor with a foam roller,
[02:19:30.960 --> 02:19:33.880]   or you're rolling jujitsu, or you're lifting weights,
[02:19:33.880 --> 02:19:37.740]   you're doing cardio, it is a good idea to take a shower
[02:19:37.740 --> 02:19:40.420]   and cleanse with a gentle cleanser as soon as possible.
[02:19:40.420 --> 02:19:42.140]   I know this sounds like just basic advice,
[02:19:42.140 --> 02:19:44.180]   but a lot of people just throw on a clean shirt
[02:19:44.180 --> 02:19:46.140]   or they don't rinse off or they don't wash their face
[02:19:46.140 --> 02:19:47.860]   and they're wondering why they're getting
[02:19:47.860 --> 02:19:49.300]   all sorts of skin issues.
[02:19:49.300 --> 02:19:51.140]   Well, there's a lot of bacteria in gyms,
[02:19:51.140 --> 02:19:53.020]   a lot of sweating people.
[02:19:53.020 --> 02:19:54.860]   There are a lot of bacteria on you,
[02:19:54.860 --> 02:19:56.180]   a lot of bacteria on the equipment.
[02:19:56.180 --> 02:19:57.580]   And yeah, you can spray down the equipment
[02:19:57.580 --> 02:19:58.620]   and do these various things,
[02:19:58.620 --> 02:20:01.300]   but it's a good idea to shower as soon as possible,
[02:20:01.300 --> 02:20:03.120]   or to bathe rather as soon as possible,
[02:20:03.120 --> 02:20:06.240]   wash your face after going to a gym for your sake
[02:20:06.240 --> 02:20:08.100]   and for the sake of others.
[02:20:08.100 --> 02:20:10.760]   Now, some rosacea is very stubborn,
[02:20:10.760 --> 02:20:12.160]   meaning it does not go away
[02:20:12.160 --> 02:20:14.520]   even if somebody makes all the appropriate
[02:20:14.520 --> 02:20:15.640]   lifestyle adjustments,
[02:20:15.640 --> 02:20:17.500]   tries any number of different medical treatments.
[02:20:17.500 --> 02:20:19.920]   And by the way, rosacea is a medical condition.
[02:20:19.920 --> 02:20:22.880]   And in some cases, people will get angiomas,
[02:20:22.880 --> 02:20:25.280]   you know, the accumulation of blood vessels
[02:20:25.280 --> 02:20:27.780]   near the surface of the skin that can be, you know,
[02:20:27.780 --> 02:20:30.280]   for them something they don't want.
[02:20:30.280 --> 02:20:33.000]   So we could say unsightly, but they just don't want it.
[02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:35.160]   Or in some cases they'll treat their rosacea
[02:20:35.160 --> 02:20:38.000]   and then they'll get an accumulation of broken vessels
[02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:39.120]   near the surface of the skin.
[02:20:39.120 --> 02:20:41.920]   This is pretty common for people that experience rosacea
[02:20:41.920 --> 02:20:43.120]   and treat rosacea.
[02:20:43.120 --> 02:20:45.000]   For these people, there is a treatment,
[02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:46.760]   it has to be done in a dermatologist's office
[02:20:46.760 --> 02:20:48.400]   called pulse dye laser,
[02:20:48.400 --> 02:20:50.680]   where they use a laser of a particular wavelength
[02:20:50.680 --> 02:20:52.940]   that can penetrate, excuse me,
[02:20:52.940 --> 02:20:55.240]   the superficial layers of the skin.
[02:20:55.240 --> 02:20:57.080]   And now you know how different wavelengths of light
[02:20:57.080 --> 02:20:59.600]   can penetrate to different depths within skin
[02:20:59.600 --> 02:21:03.840]   and destroy the blood vessels or the broken blood vessels
[02:21:03.840 --> 02:21:05.520]   that then call in immune system cells
[02:21:05.520 --> 02:21:08.040]   to clear out the destroyed endothelial cells
[02:21:08.040 --> 02:21:09.920]   and other stuff around it and take it away,
[02:21:09.920 --> 02:21:12.840]   get rid of those blood vessels that sit beneath the surface.
[02:21:12.840 --> 02:21:14.600]   Let's talk about psoriasis.
[02:21:14.600 --> 02:21:16.340]   So when I was researching this episode,
[02:21:16.340 --> 02:21:19.780]   I asked the dermatologist, is psoriasis related to yeast
[02:21:19.780 --> 02:21:21.920]   or overproduction of skin cells?
[02:21:21.920 --> 02:21:23.500]   And what they told me was really interesting.
[02:21:23.500 --> 02:21:25.760]   They said for more than 80 years
[02:21:25.760 --> 02:21:27.720]   within the dermatologic community,
[02:21:27.720 --> 02:21:30.840]   it was thought that psoriasis was just an overproduction
[02:21:30.840 --> 02:21:32.220]   of skin cells,
[02:21:32.220 --> 02:21:34.280]   but it wasn't really known what the source was.
[02:21:34.280 --> 02:21:36.720]   And it turns out that now almost all the derms,
[02:21:36.720 --> 02:21:38.040]   at least the ones I spoke to,
[02:21:38.040 --> 02:21:40.320]   said that it has something to do either directly
[02:21:40.320 --> 02:21:42.580]   or at least powerfully and indirectly
[02:21:42.580 --> 02:21:44.180]   with the immune system.
[02:21:44.180 --> 02:21:47.520]   So what can be done to treat psoriasis?
[02:21:47.520 --> 02:21:48.480]   You can probably guess.
[02:21:48.480 --> 02:21:51.820]   Things that reduce the overall level of activation
[02:21:51.820 --> 02:21:52.660]   in the immune system.
[02:21:52.660 --> 02:21:55.360]   Not so much that you become susceptible to infections
[02:21:55.360 --> 02:21:56.360]   'cause that's not good,
[02:21:56.360 --> 02:21:59.560]   but you treat this like any other autoimmune condition.
[02:21:59.560 --> 02:22:02.400]   There are now drugs, these are prescription drugs,
[02:22:02.400 --> 02:22:04.320]   that directly target the interleukins,
[02:22:04.320 --> 02:22:06.000]   the components of the immune system,
[02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:09.080]   that are directly involved in psoriasis,
[02:22:09.080 --> 02:22:12.920]   such as interleukin-17 and interleukin-23.
[02:22:12.920 --> 02:22:15.620]   And I'm told that these drugs are very effective
[02:22:15.620 --> 02:22:17.120]   in the treatment of psoriasis.
[02:22:17.120 --> 02:22:18.520]   So that's very reassuring.
[02:22:18.520 --> 02:22:22.000]   You know, I know, especially in communities online
[02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:23.800]   that are focused more on behavioral tools
[02:22:23.800 --> 02:22:26.560]   and nutrition-based tools or supplementation-based tools,
[02:22:26.560 --> 02:22:28.520]   of which I am, right, we focus on those.
[02:22:28.520 --> 02:22:31.120]   But as you probably noticed in this and other episodes
[02:22:31.120 --> 02:22:32.040]   of the "Huberman Lab" podcast,
[02:22:32.040 --> 02:22:33.780]   we also talk about prescription drugs
[02:22:33.780 --> 02:22:36.500]   that have proven to be very effective in certain conditions.
[02:22:36.500 --> 02:22:37.840]   So it's very reassuring to hear
[02:22:37.840 --> 02:22:39.880]   that there are excellent prescription drugs
[02:22:39.880 --> 02:22:42.140]   that can target the specific interleukins
[02:22:42.140 --> 02:22:45.680]   that are overactivated in psoriasis
[02:22:45.680 --> 02:22:47.400]   because psoriasis is now known
[02:22:47.400 --> 02:22:50.040]   as an overactivation of the immune system
[02:22:50.040 --> 02:22:53.520]   and a kind of turning of the body on itself, if you will,
[02:22:53.520 --> 02:22:56.700]   to create this itchy, scaly, uncomfortable,
[02:22:56.700 --> 02:22:59.600]   and in some cases, unsightly overproduction
[02:22:59.600 --> 02:23:01.760]   of skin cells at the scalp and elsewhere.
[02:23:01.760 --> 02:23:04.740]   Okay, so we've covered a lot of topics thus far.
[02:23:04.740 --> 02:23:06.680]   We've talked about skin biology.
[02:23:06.680 --> 02:23:08.180]   We talked about various skin conditions
[02:23:08.180 --> 02:23:12.080]   that are very common, such as acne, psoriasis, and so forth.
[02:23:12.080 --> 02:23:14.560]   We talked about ways to increase the youthfulness
[02:23:14.560 --> 02:23:16.180]   or the appearance of youthfulness in skin
[02:23:16.180 --> 02:23:17.200]   that are based on data,
[02:23:17.200 --> 02:23:19.760]   some that are a bit more experimental.
[02:23:19.760 --> 02:23:23.200]   And we talked about even some laser procedures
[02:23:23.200 --> 02:23:25.680]   and phototherapy, things of that sort.
[02:23:25.680 --> 02:23:27.120]   And at the same time, I acknowledge
[02:23:27.120 --> 02:23:29.320]   that there are many topics and conditions
[02:23:29.320 --> 02:23:30.960]   related to skin health and skincare
[02:23:30.960 --> 02:23:31.960]   that we did not talk about.
[02:23:31.960 --> 02:23:33.700]   We didn't talk about eczema.
[02:23:33.700 --> 02:23:35.280]   We didn't talk about Botox.
[02:23:35.280 --> 02:23:37.040]   We didn't talk about an enormous number of topics
[02:23:37.040 --> 02:23:40.160]   that I know are of interest and relevant to many of you.
[02:23:40.160 --> 02:23:41.600]   So as a consequence,
[02:23:41.600 --> 02:23:44.940]   the plan is to host various expert guests,
[02:23:44.940 --> 02:23:47.760]   both dermatologists, expert in particular areas,
[02:23:47.760 --> 02:23:50.520]   as well as, yes, a cosmetic surgeon
[02:23:50.520 --> 02:23:52.480]   who, believe it or not, does not like to cut,
[02:23:52.480 --> 02:23:55.400]   but rather likes to use fairly non-invasive procedures
[02:23:55.400 --> 02:23:57.520]   that touch on some of these very same mechanisms.
[02:23:57.520 --> 02:23:59.360]   Yes, injections of certain things,
[02:23:59.360 --> 02:24:01.720]   things that operate at the surface level of the skin,
[02:24:01.720 --> 02:24:05.040]   and sometimes surgical procedures that, you know,
[02:24:05.040 --> 02:24:07.000]   I know when people hear cosmetic surgery,
[02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:09.180]   they think, oh, people just trying to improve
[02:24:09.180 --> 02:24:11.280]   the youthfulness of their look or something of that sort.
[02:24:11.280 --> 02:24:12.960]   But, you know, that also relates
[02:24:12.960 --> 02:24:14.560]   to certain serious skin conditions
[02:24:14.560 --> 02:24:18.960]   for which surgery and non-surgical approaches can assist in.
[02:24:18.960 --> 02:24:21.000]   So the point is that any discussion about skin health
[02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:24.160]   and skincare is going to be an ongoing discussion,
[02:24:24.160 --> 02:24:27.320]   one that I do plan to continue on this podcast
[02:24:27.320 --> 02:24:29.060]   in the form of expert guest episodes,
[02:24:29.060 --> 02:24:31.400]   maybe even another solo episode.
[02:24:31.400 --> 02:24:33.760]   We've occasionally done so-called toolkit episodes
[02:24:33.760 --> 02:24:35.840]   where we summarize some of the main points
[02:24:35.840 --> 02:24:37.240]   of previous solo episodes
[02:24:37.240 --> 02:24:39.080]   and that arrive with guest episodes
[02:24:39.080 --> 02:24:41.040]   and that reflect the latest knowledge
[02:24:41.040 --> 02:24:43.160]   that gets published in between episodes.
[02:24:43.160 --> 02:24:46.720]   I do plan to cover this topic in more detail going forward.
[02:24:46.720 --> 02:24:49.520]   Meanwhile, I like to think that what I've covered today
[02:24:49.520 --> 02:24:52.440]   provides at least an introduction to the biology of skin
[02:24:52.440 --> 02:24:54.380]   and an understanding about the various things
[02:24:54.380 --> 02:24:56.080]   that we all can and should do
[02:24:56.080 --> 02:24:57.880]   for our skin health and appearance,
[02:24:57.880 --> 02:25:00.880]   as well as ways to attack certain pain points
[02:25:00.880 --> 02:25:03.040]   related to certain skin conditions
[02:25:03.040 --> 02:25:05.480]   that come from expert sources,
[02:25:05.480 --> 02:25:07.240]   from excellent literature
[02:25:07.240 --> 02:25:09.640]   that has been established over many, many decades.
[02:25:09.640 --> 02:25:12.400]   And I personally find this organ that we call skin
[02:25:12.400 --> 02:25:14.440]   to be infinitely fascinating,
[02:25:14.440 --> 02:25:16.040]   not just by virtue of what it does,
[02:25:16.040 --> 02:25:18.920]   but by virtue of all the different organ and tissue systems
[02:25:18.920 --> 02:25:20.800]   that it interacts within our body,
[02:25:20.800 --> 02:25:22.460]   and by virtue of the fact that our skin
[02:25:22.460 --> 02:25:25.800]   is this incredible living organ on the outside of our body
[02:25:25.800 --> 02:25:27.620]   that tells us oh so very much
[02:25:27.620 --> 02:25:30.920]   about how we and others are doing in terms of our immediate
[02:25:30.920 --> 02:25:33.580]   and potentially our long-term health.

[02:26:01.740 --> 02:26:03.360]   I do read all the comments.
[02:26:03.360 --> 02:26:04.500]   For those of you that haven't heard,
[02:26:04.500 --> 02:26:05.700]   I have a new book coming out.
[02:26:05.700 --> 02:26:07.320]   It's my very first book.
[02:26:07.320 --> 02:26:08.720]   It's entitled "Protocols,
[02:26:08.720 --> 02:26:10.880]   an Operating Manual for the Human Body."
[02:26:10.880 --> 02:26:12.040]   This is a book that I've been working on
[02:26:12.040 --> 02:26:13.200]   for more than five years,
[02:26:13.200 --> 02:26:15.520]   and that's based on more than 30 years
[02:26:15.520 --> 02:26:17.080]   of research and experience.
[02:26:17.080 --> 02:26:20.140]   And it covers protocols for everything from sleep,
[02:26:20.140 --> 02:26:22.640]   to exercise, to stress control,
[02:26:22.640 --> 02:26:25.080]   protocols related to focus and motivation.
[02:26:25.080 --> 02:26:28.440]   And of course, I provide the scientific substantiation
[02:26:28.440 --> 02:26:30.520]   for the protocols that are included.
[02:26:30.520 --> 02:26:34.420]   The book is now available by presale at protocolsbook.com.
[02:26:34.420 --> 02:26:36.800]   There you can find links to various vendors.
[02:26:36.800 --> 02:26:38.560]   You can pick the one that you like best.
[02:26:38.560 --> 02:26:40.320]   Again, the book is called "Protocols,
[02:26:40.320 --> 02:26:43.100]   an Operating Manual for the Human Body."
[02:26:43.100 --> 02:26:45.280]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[02:26:45.280 --> 02:26:48.280]   I am Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[02:26:48.280 --> 02:26:51.640]   So that means Instagram, X, formerly known as Twitter,
[02:26:51.640 --> 02:26:53.660]   Threads, Facebook, and LinkedIn.
[02:26:53.660 --> 02:26:54.980]   And on all those platforms,
[02:26:54.980 --> 02:26:57.320]   I cover science and science-related tools,
[02:26:57.320 --> 02:26:58.800]   some of which overlaps with the content
[02:26:58.800 --> 02:27:00.280]   of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[02:27:00.280 --> 02:27:02.680]   but much of which is distinct from the content I cover
[02:27:02.680 --> 02:27:04.080]   on the Huberman Lab podcast.
[02:27:04.080 --> 02:27:07.520]   So again, that's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[02:27:07.520 --> 02:27:08.760]   If you haven't already subscribed
[02:27:08.760 --> 02:27:10.400]   to our Neural Network newsletter,
[02:27:10.400 --> 02:27:11.720]   our Neural Network newsletter
[02:27:11.720 --> 02:27:13.800]   is a zero-cost monthly newsletter
[02:27:13.800 --> 02:27:16.320]   that includes summaries of podcast episodes,
[02:27:16.320 --> 02:27:18.240]   as well as protocols in the form of brief
[02:27:18.240 --> 02:27:21.480]   one-to-three-page PDFs that explain protocols
[02:27:21.480 --> 02:27:24.520]   for things like deliberate heat or deliberate cold exposure,
[02:27:24.520 --> 02:27:26.960]   for optimizing dopamine, for improving your sleep,
[02:27:26.960 --> 02:27:28.400]   for neuroplasticity and learning.
[02:27:28.400 --> 02:27:30.760]   Again, all zero costs in the format
[02:27:30.760 --> 02:27:32.280]   of one-to-three-page PDFs.
[02:27:32.280 --> 02:27:34.880]   To access it, you simply go to hubermanlab.com,
[02:27:34.880 --> 02:27:36.080]   go to the menu tab,
[02:27:36.080 --> 02:27:38.400]   scroll down to newsletter, and enter your email.
[02:27:38.400 --> 02:27:40.840]   And we do not share your email with anybody.
[02:27:40.840 --> 02:27:43.020]   Thank you for joining me for today's discussion
[02:27:43.020 --> 02:27:45.960]   all about skin health and skincare.
[02:27:45.960 --> 02:27:48.240]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:27:48.240 --> 02:27:50.200]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:27:50.200 --> 02:27:53.560]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:27:53.560 --> 02:27:55.620]   you
