[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760]   - Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai,
[00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.760]   and in this episode I have a special guest with me today,
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.140]   my shelter in place partner in crime, my wife.
[00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:11.400]   - Hello everybody.
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.680]   - Sydney, good seeing you.
[00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.920]   Thanks for joining us on this podcast.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.860]   I guess it's us, it's just me.
[00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.160]   But in this episode I wanna talk about homeschooling
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.440]   and our dilemma of whether to send our three year old son
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.440]   back to preschool once school opens,
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.640]   or keep him home with us and homeschool.
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.440]   So just to start off with,
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.920]   you know it's a really tough time right now.
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.120]   Our school shut down mid-March 2020,
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.160]   and has not opened yet, and right now we're in mid-July.
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.480]   Originally they were thinking they were gonna open
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.080]   in the beginning of August,
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.400]   but now that seems to be getting pushed back to September.
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.440]   And you're also seeing a lot of other states push back
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.160]   their in-person schooling,
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.900]   or not have in-person schooling at all.
[00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.400]   San Diego, LA, even Houston I think,
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.720]   it's all online learning now.
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.520]   So it made us wonder, okay,
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.760]   maybe we shouldn't send our son to school
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.040]   because there could be a lot of risk.
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.720]   So I wanted to interview you, Sydney,
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.640]   and get your thoughts about homeschooling.
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.360]   So what are your thoughts?
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.400]   - Homeschooling is something we've had
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.560]   in the back of our mind,
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.120]   even way before the pandemic happened.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.000]   You know, especially when we've been talking
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.800]   about the cost of education these days,
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.040]   and especially in an expensive city like San Francisco,
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.440]   sending a kid to private school
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.160]   can be over $30,000 a year at some places.
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.640]   - Tell the listeners how much we paid
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.560]   for preschool a month.
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.640]   - So we paid about $1,900 a month.
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.640]   - So originally it was $1,830 a month,
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.640]   and then the month before we sent our son to preschool,
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.840]   I think it was September 2019, right?
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:57.680]   - Yes. - They said,
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.200]   "We're gonna raise it to $1,950 a month."
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.360]   - Right, they raised it,
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.360]   and then he turned three,
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.600]   and we saved roughly $100,
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.600]   but we didn't get to take advantage of that,
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.680]   quote, unquote, "discount" for very long
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.120]   because the school shut down shortly thereafter.
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.360]   - Yeah, it's kind of funny that it costs more
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.440]   if you send your kid under three,
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.080]   but then you get a discount after three,
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.800]   so I'm assuming they're easier to manage,
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.200]   but based on our experience,
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.440]   managing or parenting a three-year-old
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.200]   has been quite a challenge,
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.440]   given his very robust personality.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.920]   - Yeah, I can see how two-year-olds take more time,
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.840]   but kids are just constantly changing.
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.160]   - To different challenges at two versus three.
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.480]   - Right, so what do you think were the pros
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.280]   of going to preschool?
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.720]   - There are lots of different pros
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.800]   that I could see pretty quickly.
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.840]   He got to make friends, which was so exciting.
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.200]   He'd come home and he'd tell us
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.920]   about everybody's name in the class,
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.920]   and he would also do a lot of different activities
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.500]   that we weren't doing with him at home,
[00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.580]   and he got to interact with kids his own age,
[00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.860]   as well as kids that were several years older.
[00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.720]   The school goes from age two to five,
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.980]   and most of the day is with their own age.
[00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.760]   However, there are times during the day
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.420]   where they have mixed-age play,
[00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.560]   and that was really neat,
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.560]   and then there's a lot of extra activities that they do.
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.340]   - Like field trips.
[00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.460]   - Field trips, yes, the field trips were amazing.
[00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.940]   He would just love those,
[00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.540]   and the school did a great job
[00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.660]   with documentation and sending pictures,
[00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.140]   and we were involved with a lot of those extra activities
[00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.000]   around the holidays and the field trips.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.700]   - Oh yeah, the holiday sing-along was amazing.
[00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.380]   - Yeah, he was having a great time.
[00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.580]   - That was great to have his grandparents over and stuff.
[00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.820]   And also another benefit was the free time
[00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.940]   that we could free up during our day
[00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.660]   to write, to do our own thing,
[00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.700]   to take naps, and to relax.
[00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.540]   - Yeah, and it was a huge benefit for me in the beginning
[00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.780]   because I was very pregnant with our daughter,
[00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.820]   and I had a hard pregnancy,
[00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.820]   so being able to have some time without our son all over me
[00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.860]   definitely helped me a lot.
[00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.340]   - Right, so preschool was a pretty good experience.
[00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.340]   However, after you gave birth in December 2019,
[00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:49.260]   we had a couple weeks of just our son, our daughter,
[00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.580]   all of us together, 'cause it was winter break,
[00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.860]   and then when we sent him back after winter break,
[00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.300]   he got sick.
[00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.300]   - He got sick within that week.
[00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:00.140]   - The first week.
[00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:01.300]   - Yeah, it was bad.
[00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:06.300]   He came home, and he had a fever that night,
[00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.660]   and fortunately his fever broke fairly quickly,
[00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:16.660]   but then he just was sick for at least one to two weeks
[00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.380]   at a minimum, probably was longer than that.
[00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.140]   It felt like forever, and then I got sick,
[00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.260]   you got sick, our daughter got sick.
[00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:26.820]   It was rough.
[00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.220]   - So everybody got sick, so I ended up writing a post called
[00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:31.580]   The Biggest Downside of Preschools,
[00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.100]   not the cost, but it's the perpetual sickness.
[00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.860]   And I know I've talked to a lot of people,
[00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.420]   a lot of parents who say, you know,
[00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:39.500]   you gotta get sick early.
[00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.980]   If you don't get sick early, they're gonna get sick late.
[00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:43.340]   You can't avoid it.
[00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.260]   You know, this is how you build your immune system
[00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.140]   and all that good stuff, but man,
[00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:48.980]   just all of us going down for the count
[00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:52.020]   is actually quite dangerous,
[00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.340]   especially if you have a newborn.
[00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.340]   Newborn, supposedly their immune system
[00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.580]   isn't fully developed until about six months,
[00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.300]   and it was such a bummer when our daughter got sick
[00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.340]   for, what, four or five days.
[00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:06.020]   - Oh yeah, it was so sad.
[00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.900]   I mean, she was coughing so hard that she would vomit,
[00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.340]   and oh, it was so stressful.
[00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.820]   - It was really stressful. - It was really, really scary.
[00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.220]   - And then I ended up getting sick for three months
[00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.820]   because I remember coughing and wearing a mask
[00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.660]   during delivery, which was kind of a bummer
[00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.980]   because I wanted to like snuggle and kiss my daughter,
[00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.940]   but I couldn't because I didn't wanna get her sick.
[00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:32.940]   So I was coughing from mid-December through end of February.
[00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.660]   So it was like a three-month sickness,
[00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.300]   and I was looking back at my notes,
[00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.740]   and it was saying I had chills,
[00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:44.220]   and I didn't notice a fever, but I had dry cough, dry cough,
[00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:46.060]   and then now looking back, I'm wondering,
[00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:47.220]   did I have COVID-19?
[00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:50.300]   I have no idea, and frankly, I hope I did,
[00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:51.500]   and I hope all of us did
[00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.620]   because then hopefully we'd have some antibodies
[00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:56.900]   and we won't be so stressed out when we're going outside.
[00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.380]   - Yeah, it's hard to know.
[00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:00.460]   - It's hard to know.
[00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:05.340]   So the biggest downside really kinda is the sickness,
[00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:08.980]   and if you are not in good health to begin with,
[00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:10.420]   it's gonna be tough.
[00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:14.140]   I'm proud to say that Financial Samurai didn't miss a beat
[00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:15.700]   during my three-month-long sickness.
[00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:17.740]   There's still three posts going out a week.
[00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:19.620]   There's still one newsletter going out a week.
[00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:22.620]   I still did the podcast, but it was tough, folks.
[00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:26.280]   So we've basically been homeschooling since mid-March,
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:29.020]   and now it's mid-July, so that's April, May, June, July,
[00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:30.860]   so four months now.
[00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:33.800]   How do you feel about homeschooling,
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.260]   and how do you think about homeschooling going forward?
[00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.020]   - In the beginning, it was hard
[00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:43.700]   because we hadn't planned for it.
[00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:47.340]   I think both Sam and I are big planners,
[00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:50.500]   and we actually pulled our son out a couple weeks
[00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.340]   before the school officially shut down
[00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:56.540]   because of the news, and we just felt concerned,
[00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:59.980]   and our immune systems were already compromised
[00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:04.980]   at that point, and we didn't wanna risk getting sick again.
[00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:08.260]   So yeah, it was hard in the beginning,
[00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.360]   but then it's almost like a muscle.
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.540]   You get stronger over time, you get used to it.
[00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:14.380]   - The routine.
[00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:16.420]   - Yeah, we just kinda developed a routine,
[00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:21.420]   and now it's hard to imagine him being gone again.
[00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:24.580]   So I think I would really miss him again.
[00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:28.760]   - I think we would miss him, and I think we would feel bad.
[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.660]   We would really feel bad sending him
[00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:32.540]   before there's a vaccine.
[00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:33.940]   I mean, I can just imagine,
[00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:35.940]   let's say school opens up September.
[00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:40.180]   We drop him off at, I don't know, 8.30, 9 a.m.,
[00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:44.220]   and then we pick him up after his nap at four or five.
[00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:48.060]   It just feels bad because we both don't have full-time jobs.
[00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:51.420]   Now, we keep ourselves disciplined by writing,
[00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:53.580]   podcasting, and we have, obviously,
[00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:55.380]   a baby at home to take care of,
[00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:59.360]   but there is none of that outside pressure
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.760]   to perform at a job to earn money.
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.000]   At the same time, we still earn money
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.400]   through passive income and through our website,
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.160]   and that's something that we'd like to keep up with
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:10.400]   because we're in a global pandemic,
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.660]   and just it's better to have more than less
[00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:14.200]   during times of uncertainty.
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:18.120]   So we decided very recently
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:22.120]   that we would not send our son back to school
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.920]   until there's a vaccine.
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:27.200]   It's probably not gonna be until 2021.
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.720]   And what do you think about that?
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.600]   - Well, I will mention that we originally
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.280]   thought we were gonna do it.
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:36.680]   The school asked for, or the school announced
[00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:40.000]   in early July that they were going to reopen in August,
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.200]   and I had a big fear that if we pulled him out,
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.960]   we'd never be able to get him back in.
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:49.240]   Preschool in San Francisco is extremely competitive.
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.880]   It's ridiculous that it's so hard to get in
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:53.520]   to good schools. - Yeah, we got rejected
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.080]   six out of seven places we applied.
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.640]   - Yeah, and so I had this big fear,
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:58.840]   and I was like, well, you know,
[00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:00.520]   maybe we say we're gonna go,
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:02.680]   and then we just pay for the month of August,
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:06.560]   but then send him late in the month, yada, yada, yada.
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.120]   So we gave the school our decision,
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.600]   and then it just did not-- - Our decision not--
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.720]   - Decision to go first. - Oh, to go, to go first.
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:16.080]   - And then it just didn't sit well with either of us
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:17.520]   the more we kept thinking about it.
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.240]   - I talked to my dad, I was like,
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:21.360]   oh, we're gonna send our son to preschool in August,
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.200]   and he said, what?
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:23.400]   - What are you doing?
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:24.240]   - What?
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.560]   He's like, what are you talking about?
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:26.840]   Why would you do that?
[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:27.680]   - Yes.
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:28.880]   - Aren't you afraid of the virus?
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:33.600]   - So we talked about it again after the deadline had passed
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.480]   that the school needed an answer,
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:38.560]   and then we came back the next day
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:41.860]   and told them we changed our mind
[00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:45.220]   because we just didn't feel right about it.
[00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:47.560]   We wanted to be more cautious.
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:49.880]   We have the luxury to stay at home with him
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.900]   and work on a flexible schedule,
[00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:56.640]   and that we'd hoped to be able to put him back in
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.320]   at a later date.
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.120]   The school told us they can't guarantee
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:03.120]   that he'll get back in, which is understandable,
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:06.720]   but that he would at least be on a priority wait list.
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:10.120]   - Yeah, and we kept on telling ourselves
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:12.120]   the what if scenario.
[00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:16.160]   What if we sent him back to school and he got sick
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.200]   and got us all sick?
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:20.520]   Well, that chance is probably 80% chance.
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:22.980]   Kids are germy, they touch each other,
[00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:25.020]   they sneeze, they cough, they don't wash their hands.
[00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:27.180]   So all of us getting sick again
[00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:30.500]   was probably an 80 plus percent probability
[00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:31.780]   within the first month.
[00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:34.060]   And I turned around that equation and said,
[00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:36.140]   how much would I be willing to pay
[00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:38.440]   not to feel sick for a month,
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:40.100]   not to feel sick for three months?
[00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:41.540]   I mean, I would pay a lot of money
[00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:44.180]   not to go through what I experienced earlier this year.
[00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:45.860]   It was the longest sickness of my life.
[00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:48.220]   - I know, and the other thing that went through my mind
[00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:52.760]   is 10, 20 years down the road, when we look back,
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:57.400]   are we gonna feel good about sending him back to school
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:00.120]   when we have the option to keep him home?
[00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.960]   No, I think we would be kicking ourselves
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:05.000]   and saying, what the hell are we doing
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   sending him back when we didn't need to?
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.280]   - Yeah, we have an option.
[00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:12.320]   So the only reason why we would send him
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:16.520]   would frankly come down to parental laziness, right?
[00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:18.700]   Because we have the option to take care of him.
[00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:23.060]   So setting him would mean we need a break,
[00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:25.920]   we're just dead tired.
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:28.840]   I mean, after four months, it's been pretty difficult.
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:32.540]   But the groove has happened.
[00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:34.240]   - Yeah, we're used to it.
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.800]   This is our new normal, I think.
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:37.800]   - Our new normal, right.
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:41.960]   - We're fortunate that we can work on flexible hours.
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:44.960]   - Right, and we don't even really need to work.
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.320]   I mean, I have another problem,
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:47.720]   and that is I have this commitment
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:49.760]   to publish three times a week and do the newsletter
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:51.040]   and do this podcast,
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.640]   which I did take a couple week break, thank goodness.
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.840]   And it's just kind of hard to break free
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:58.720]   and not do it after 11 years now.
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.080]   - Self-imposed pressure.
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.800]   - Self-imposed pressure is just kind of brutal.
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.960]   And I'm just trying to figure out ways to just say,
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:09.040]   hey, just relax, we're a global pandemic.
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:11.500]   You don't have to get ahead, you can just kind of survive.
[00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:16.500]   But there's this inherent need or desire to provide,
[00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:20.540]   I feel, every time a child is born.
[00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:23.140]   I feel, uh-oh, I've got two kids now,
[00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:24.980]   we both don't have jobs,
[00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:28.860]   we got to, or I gotta at least provide the bacon
[00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:30.520]   because I can't feed my baby.
[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:33.300]   So I gotta provide the bacon,
[00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:35.460]   and so I just need to be on the ball.
[00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:38.020]   - Yeah, and you've done a phenomenal job,
[00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:41.380]   and I think the readers definitely appreciate that too.
[00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:43.140]   - Thank you, I appreciate it.
[00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:45.340]   Can you leave a five-star review?
[00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:47.420]   - Of course, I already have.
[00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:49.380]   (laughing)
[00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:51.900]   - Anyway, so since we've decided to homeschool,
[00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:53.340]   at least until the vaccine,
[00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:55.100]   we've got to come up with a plan.
[00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:57.660]   And the plan has to have some structure
[00:13:57.660 --> 00:13:59.060]   because if it was up to our son,
[00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:01.100]   he would just play and go, "Ah!"
[00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:04.100]   And go out and all day long, right?
[00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:06.200]   So we've got to divide and conquer.
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:08.180]   We've got to divide and conquer on the fundamentals,
[00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:10.180]   we've got to research homeschooling.
[00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:13.540]   I mean, at three years old, we're basically,
[00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:15.300]   we're gonna teach him language,
[00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:19.100]   his communication skills, problem solving.
[00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:22.460]   - Problem solving, but there is still a lot of play
[00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:26.860]   that's needed at this age, which is easy for him,
[00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:27.740]   easy for us.
[00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:30.460]   - Compound interest rate calculations.
[00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:34.140]   - Not yet, but he is, I say he's quite advanced
[00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:36.900]   with math for his age, and he's reading already as well.
[00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:40.140]   - Right, well, let's just say that every single parent
[00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:43.140]   believes their child is advanced,
[00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:45.060]   and so we feel the same way,
[00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:47.900]   but the reality is we're probably just average.
[00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:50.140]   - Well, I will say that at the beginning
[00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:52.860]   of the preschool year, when we had the open house,
[00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:57.340]   they had a presentation on the goals for his class
[00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:59.620]   for the whole year, and one of the goals
[00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:02.300]   was to be able to count to 10.
[00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:04.940]   However, he was already counting
[00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:08.500]   into the millions, quadrillions.
[00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:11.820]   - He was counting.
[00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:14.180]   - He could count to 1,000, but we taught him millions,
[00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:16.780]   billions, quadrillions, infinity, and all that.
[00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:19.340]   - Yeah, and he also already knew his ABCs.
[00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:23.100]   He could recognize uppercase, lowercase letters.
[00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:24.460]   - Colors. - Yeah, colors.
[00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:26.740]   - Shapes. - Yeah, he--
[00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:28.460]   - He was pretty advanced.
[00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:30.380]   - But socially and emotionally,
[00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:33.700]   he definitely needs some work still.
[00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:36.020]   - But I think at three years old,
[00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:37.260]   it's all the me phase, right?
[00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:38.180]   Me, me, me, me, me.
[00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:39.220]   - Yeah, there's a lot of that.
[00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:40.100]   - Not so much sharing.
[00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:43.220]   - Fortunately, he never bit or hit anyone at class.
[00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:44.340]   He was the victim. - But he did get bit.
[00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:45.860]   - He was a victim, unfortunately.
[00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:47.540]   - That actually pissed me off.
[00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:49.300]   I was like, who is this kid?
[00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:51.300]   And who are your parents? - It's very common
[00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:54.940]   in all schools, but unfortunate, yeah.
[00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:57.220]   - So I think from a homeschooling perspective,
[00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:58.100]   it's much more efficient.
[00:15:58.100 --> 00:15:59.260]   Just like working from home,
[00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.100]   as many of you guys all experience,
[00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:03.140]   is much more efficient, it's more productive.
[00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:07.000]   I wake up 5 a.m., I can start cranking things out,
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.940]   starting at 5.30 and finish by 7.30,
[00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:09.940]   and I've got my day free.
[00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:11.940]   The problem with me is I just don't stop,
[00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:12.860]   and I need to stop.
[00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:15.100]   And I think a problem with many people who work from home now
[00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:17.460]   is they just end up working more and more and more.
[00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:19.140]   At least this is the feedback
[00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:21.700]   that I've gotten from many of my friends.
[00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:23.100]   So on the homeschooling front,
[00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:25.020]   I think we're gonna divide and conquer
[00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:26.700]   in terms of subjects.
[00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:29.420]   So I'll take, let's say P.E.,
[00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:33.100]   Mandarin, arithmetic,
[00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:36.260]   and what do you wanna take?
[00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.640]   Oh, I'm helping him with his reading.
[00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:39.480]   - Reading, yeah, and writing.
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:43.560]   - So we've been working on his phonics and sight words
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:48.560]   and putting together short sentences and reading together.
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:52.080]   And he's picked up on that really well.
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:53.360]   He's having a lot of fun with that.
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:56.400]   So I'm gonna continue on with that.
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:59.160]   And we do a lot of math games together.
[00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:02.400]   - Problem solving.
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:04.480]   - Yeah, problem solving. - Sharing situations.
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:05.320]   - Yeah.
[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:07.600]   So I think, I don't know, for us,
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:10.700]   it's kinda, I think it's probably easier, right?
[00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:14.400]   It's easier to homeschool a three-year-old, I think,
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.140]   than homeschooling a 15-year-old,
[00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:19.380]   but maybe the 15-year-old is gonna be totally belligerent.
[00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:22.320]   - You can't compare.
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:23.160]   - I mean, who knows?
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:24.440]   - You can't compare the two.
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:29.440]   - I'm expecting 15-year-old son to be totally disciplined,
[00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:33.080]   listen to everything we say, or else no soup for him.
[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:33.920]   - Yeah, right.
[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:35.720]   (laughing)
[00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:37.520]   But here's the thing, the other thing about homeschooling
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:41.800]   is if you are retired early,
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:44.280]   or if you have an online business,
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:49.240]   I mean, what a great way to do both,
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:52.040]   and to also travel once travel restrictions are lifted.
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:54.880]   - Right, and once this whole social distancing thing
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:58.080]   goes away and we're not worried about the vaccine anymore,
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:03.080]   there are groups of other homeschooling parents
[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:08.280]   that get together and let their kids socialize together.
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:11.080]   Yeah, that's just not really happening now.
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:13.840]   - Surely, there's gonna be a boom in homeschooling
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:18.840]   and these little pods of homeschool family get-togethers.
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:20.640]   - I would think so.
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:21.480]   - Yeah.
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:23.800]   - I mean, I don't expect everyone to do it by any means,
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:28.040]   but I think some families who were maybe on the fence before
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.440]   are probably--
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:32.160]   - There's no other option, frankly, sometimes.
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:33.520]   - Yeah.
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:36.600]   - So I wanted to ask you about the stigma that I hear,
[00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:40.120]   and maybe you guys hear about homeschooled children
[00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:43.120]   being a little bit more awkward and weird
[00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:44.200]   than the average person.
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:45.880]   What are your thoughts?
[00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:49.000]   - I will be frank that I did have a colleague
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   at one of my full-time jobs who was homeschooled.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   - And--
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:55.840]   - Socially awkward?
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:19:00.280]   - She was an only child and she was very socially awkward.
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:03.200]   - But you guys hired her.
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:05.360]   - But she was, yeah, she was hired.
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:08.000]   I mean, I wasn't involved in that process.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.480]   She did her job well, but she had a bad attitude.
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:16.600]   She definitely thought she deserved better
[00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:19.120]   than the role she was hired for.
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:20.360]   She was hard to work with.
[00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:22.840]   - Okay, those are all bad attributes.
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:26.840]   - So I had that bad experience with her alone,
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:30.760]   but I'm not gonna say that she represents
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:33.800]   all homeschooled kids by any means.
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:36.680]   - I just feel it's very dangerous to generalize.
[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:41.680]   - I totally agree, and I have friends from college
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:47.400]   who, same age, but have older children
[00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:49.040]   who decided to homeschool,
[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:51.680]   and it's been working out really well for them.
[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:56.680]   And I think homeschooling now versus 10, 20 years ago
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:58.400]   is different too, I think.
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:19:59.240]   - Thanks to technology.
[00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:01.440]   - Yeah, I think technology makes a big difference,
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:04.920]   and I think there's just more families doing it.
[00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:09.560]   So there are more of these groups that come together
[00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:12.120]   and have interactions for the kids.
[00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:16.880]   And there's other ways that kids can participate
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:21.760]   in group activities outside of our typical classroom as well.
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:23.560]   So there's lots of avenues to explore.
[00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:25.720]   - So regarding that stigma,
[00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:28.000]   I've always heard that stigma, unfortunately,
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.400]   but I don't know if that stigma or that stereotype is true,
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:34.080]   because think about how many socially awkward
[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:37.200]   and weird people there are who went to normal school.
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.720]   - That's very true.
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:40.160]   - Right? - Yeah.
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:41.680]   - I mean, so talk about, hey,
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:43.960]   maybe normal school is making you weird and awkward.
[00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:48.960]   - Yeah, there's weird and crazy people everywhere,
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:52.280]   just like there's normal, wonderful,
[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:56.000]   phenomenal people everywhere too.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.760]   - Yeah, so I think it's,
[00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:01.640]   so let's throw that stereotype aside.
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:03.560]   I mean, if you're homeschooled,
[00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:08.200]   you're probably getting more education more quickly.
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:10.120]   You get more love from your parents
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:12.760]   because you're spending more time with your parents.
[00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:14.440]   And I think times are different now
[00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:15.560]   than they were in the past.
[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:18.360]   And I think attitudes towards homeschooling
[00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:21.360]   is quickly changing, just like the adoption
[00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:23.480]   of working from home or moving
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:25.120]   to a lower cost area of the country.
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:28.240]   - And I will say one thing that we are open
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:30.720]   to as parents is digital learning.
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:34.600]   I know some parents are very anti-device,
[00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:36.260]   electronic devices with their kids.
[00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:38.040]   And if that's the way they wanna raise their kids,
[00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:40.040]   that's great for them.
[00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:42.560]   For us, we're really open to it.
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:46.920]   Our son watches videos on the iPad every day,
[00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:48.720]   and he's learned a lot from it.
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:51.840]   There's some great educational videos out there for kids.
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:52.760]   - Right.
[00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:55.120]   - And how could we be against digital learning
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:57.520]   if we have Financial Samurai as the website,
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:59.400]   and then the podcast,
[00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:01.200]   and then whatever else we wanna create?
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:04.160]   I mean, we're definitely pro-digital learning,
[00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:07.480]   and it's a much more efficient and scalable way to learn.
[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:08.320]   - Right.
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:11.240]   I think it's, I still think it's really important
[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:15.220]   to have physical interaction with people.
[00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:18.920]   It's just been a great additional resource
[00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:21.560]   that we've been able to utilize with our son.
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:23.200]   - Oh, and there's this one other thing
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:25.360]   that I wanted to mention before we finish,
[00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:27.400]   'cause it's been a long episode.
[00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:29.560]   And that is, if we're gonna homeschool for life,
[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:31.340]   let's say we have the vaccine.
[00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:32.240]   We don't have the vaccine.
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:34.160]   Let's say it's COVID-19,
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:35.360]   and the next year is COVID-20, COVID-20,
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:38.200]   and 2021, it's like COVID for life, right?
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:40.040]   I mean, it's funny, but it's not funny.
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:42.080]   I mean, it's funny because it's kind of crazy
[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:47.080]   that we've shut down everything for this virus.
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:50.600]   And one of the things to counteract
[00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:53.160]   that lonely child syndrome that might be socially awkward
[00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:56.840]   is maybe having a brood of children, right?
[00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:59.480]   Let's say you have five children.
[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:03.040]   They can all learn to play together.
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:05.000]   You don't need to send them to school anymore.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.400]   They need to learn to share
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:08.480]   and communicate with their siblings.
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:10.960]   - Okay, we're not going to have five kids.
[00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:13.020]   - I know, but I'm just saying, let's just, for example.
[00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:17.360]   So therefore, for those of you who only have one kid
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:19.680]   who's on the fence and wanna have another kid,
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:22.720]   or who has two kids and wanna have a third kid,
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:25.480]   hey, maybe this is a benefit
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:28.040]   so your children can share and play together.
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:30.680]   - Well, you know, that reminds me,
[00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:33.760]   way back when our grandparents were in school,
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:36.560]   at least my grandmother, she went to a school
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:38.760]   where there was one little schoolhouse
[00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:40.440]   way out in the country,
[00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:44.920]   and there were no separate grades based on your age.
[00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:47.200]   Everybody was in the same classroom.
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:48.320]   - Really? - Yeah.
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:51.720]   And so the teacher had to accommodate everybody.
[00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:53.240]   - Sounds messy.
[00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:54.080]   Sounds difficult.
[00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:56.440]   - Yeah, it looks messy, but I don't know.
[00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:58.440]   That just randomly popped in my head.
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:23:59.960]   - And then so finally,
[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:04.360]   so our kids will become adults technically at 18,
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:07.340]   but they're probably still not adults mentally
[00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:08.760]   'cause it takes, I don't know,
[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:11.960]   you're 24, 27 before your brain fully develops.
[00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:15.560]   So mentally, I found that challenging yourself
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:16.720]   to do hard things,
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:20.240]   for example, writing three times a week for 10 years.
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:24.800]   It's hard, but if you mentally tell yourself upfront,
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:27.600]   okay, the most we have to homeschool
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:30.680]   is 15 more years for our son
[00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:32.940]   and 18 years for our daughter,
[00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:36.920]   that's it, we'll be free afterwards.
[00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:37.760]   - Yeah.
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:38.760]   - I mean, we just have to say
[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:40.920]   that's hopefully the worst case scenario.
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:43.720]   - Or maybe even earlier.
[00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:44.560]   I don't know how hard it's like--
[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:46.920]   - Oh yeah, why can't they graduate young?
[00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:48.520]   - If you pass whatever standards--
[00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:49.480]   - The GED?
[00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:50.600]   - I don't know what the standards are.
[00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:51.520]   - I mean, we had the what?
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:54.360]   Didn't Doogie Howser go to medical school at 16?
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:55.560]   - That was a TV show.
[00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:57.560]   (laughing)
[00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:58.840]   But yeah, I get your point.
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:00.320]   - Oh my gosh, that's right.
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:02.460]   We don't have to do 18 years each.
[00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:04.560]   Maybe we do 16 years each
[00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:06.760]   because we're gonna accelerate, they're gonna--
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:08.880]   - 'Cause some, even in traditional schools,
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:11.560]   some kids are able to graduate early.
[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:14.520]   - Yeah, take college credit while they're in high school.
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:15.440]   - Right.
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.680]   - Oh, oh, I totally didn't think about that.
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:20.000]   That's a total no-brainer.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.320]   It's like, why on earth is going to college
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:25.640]   still the same for four years?
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:27.560]   Hello, the internet was invented
[00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:28.780]   and now it's like ubiquitous.
[00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:33.080]   You can do a research paper and learn four times faster.
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:34.680]   I mean, colleges shouldn't be four years anymore.
[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:38.000]   It should be two to three years max.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.320]   And it'll be cheaper too.
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:42.480]   - That would be interesting.
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:43.520]   - Yeah.
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:45.880]   So anyway, so this is our lovely conversation
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:47.160]   on homeschooling.
[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:50.120]   If you are thinking about homeschooling for life
[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:52.880]   or at least for the next 18 years,
[00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:53.800]   sounds like a long time,
[00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:55.620]   but there could be a lot of benefits.
[00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:58.840]   There is also a lot of negatives, which is a lot of effort,
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:01.560]   but we have never failed due to a lack of effort, right?
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:03.920]   That is one of the key principles on Financial Samurai.
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:05.480]   We'd love to hear from you,
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:07.160]   either in the comment section,
[00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:09.260]   'cause I'm gonna write a post about this as well,
[00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:10.920]   or you can drop a great review
[00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:13.260]   and leave a comment about the subject as well.
[00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:14.100]   We're gonna talk about this.
[00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:16.200]   We're gonna be parents for life,
[00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:18.400]   and we're gonna have a lot of these type of subjects
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:19.560]   going forward.
[00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:22.040]   So thanks so much for listening and take care.
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:23.320]   - Bye everybody.
