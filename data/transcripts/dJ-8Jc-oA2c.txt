[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.420]   - I'm curious, is there like a Lonely Planet
[00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.920]   or another source of like the world guidebook
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.300]   where it's like, you know, a page or so
[00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.840]   and about each country where you can kind of just start
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.400]   to like wet your palate on different places
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.560]   or I know Lonely Planet, I don't know if you still do,
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.160]   but they used to have this thorn tree forum online
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.900]   where you could go ask questions.
[00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.420]   Anything in that realm of kind of broader inspiration?
[00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.040]   Obviously, you know, if you knew Slovenia,
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.860]   you could go get a guidebook about Slovenia
[00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:31.700]   and get the inspiration.
[00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.860]   But if you didn't know Slovenia, you know,
[00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.900]   do you start with a continent or any ideas there?
[00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.880]   - Yeah, I mean, there is actually a Lonely Planet world book.
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.220]   I actually don't know the last time we put it out,
[00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.060]   but I've seen it before.
[00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.740]   It's this huge, thick doorstopper of a volume
[00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.320]   that's just like an overview of the world.
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.580]   I wouldn't necessarily recommend that.
[00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.980]   It's a big, big read to start going through.
[00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.720]   I mean, for better or for worse,
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.180]   I do think social media is a huge part of it.
[00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.580]   And it takes a little bit of your own work, I think,
[00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.300]   to filter through all the BS, so to speak,
[00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.000]   and the surface level stuff and the oversaturated photos
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.640]   and the, you know, influencer shots on the beach
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.060]   that aren't really telling you anything about the place.
[00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.580]   But once you get past that,
[00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.860]   you can find some really incredible information
[00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.700]   on social media, just regular people out and about
[00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.020]   who put a Slovenia hashtag on something, or maybe not.
[00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.020]   Maybe they put a bike touring hashtag.
[00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.620]   And you're looking at the bike touring hashtag
[00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.720]   'cause you're interested in doing something with bikes.
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:26.960]   And you're like, where is this?
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.540]   Like, where is this person like drinking a glass of wine,
[00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.220]   looking at this beautiful valley
[00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.340]   with a bike in the background?
[00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.920]   Oh, it's Slovenia, huh, really?
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.100]   So I think like searching kind of subject areas
[00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.900]   and social media is sort of the digital equivalent
[00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.660]   of hanging out at a bar with the entire world
[00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.700]   and asking for recommendations, you know?
[00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.000]   And it means you got to comb through some garbage
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.540]   to get to the good stuff, but it's in there.
[00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.340]   And it's the most, like the really genuine,
[00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.700]   from the heart, personal stuff
[00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.160]   that when you get to those recommendations,
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.100]   I think they mean a lot.
[00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.620]   I do it even as a journalist.
[00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.460]   If I'm like interested in seeing
[00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.260]   where people are bike touring
[00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.540]   or where people are backpacking or hiking,
[00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.900]   like I'll search those hashtags.
[00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.300]   I'll follow those accounts on, you know,
[00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.700]   TikTok and Instagram or whatever,
[00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.860]   and just see where people are hanging out
[00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.560]   and what people are talking about.
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.960]   'Cause for better or for worse, it is a pulse
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.180]   and you're looking for a pulse
[00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.620]   and you're looking for a trend and it's there.
[00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.300]   So I think that's one way.
[00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.140]   I think, you know, what I like to do is,
[00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.460]   yeah, starting with a continent, maybe.
[00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:31.580]   Maybe you're like, okay, Europe.
[00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.500]   I want to do a trip in Europe,
[00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.840]   but maybe I'm thinking beyond Spain, Italy, France.
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.180]   Just like look at a map and pick a country
[00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.380]   and be like, oh, Albania.
[00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:43.900]   Like what's going on in Albania?
[00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:44.940]   And then you can start looking there
[00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.260]   and maybe something's going to interest you.
[00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.140]   Maybe it won't.
[00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.980]   Maybe you'll be like, okay,
[00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.220]   this looks a little too rough for me.
[00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.200]   I need something with more infrastructure.
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.740]   And then you look West and you're like, okay,
[00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.300]   maybe one of these, you know, maybe Croatia,
[00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.500]   maybe Slovenia, maybe Czech Republic.
[00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.100]   And just like looking at a physical map
[00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.300]   and like dreaming about it a little bit.
[00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.580]   And 'cause I know we'll probably get to this later,
[00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.220]   but I am of the firm belief that everywhere,
[00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.980]   literally everywhere has something to offer
[00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.180]   if you open yourself up to it.
[00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.300]   It has something that's going to blow your mind.
[00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.460]   If you spend a little time,
[00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.200]   if you approach it with an open mind,
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.060]   you'll find something that's going to blow your mind,
[00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.220]   even in your own backyard.
[00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.020]   I live two blocks from Prospect Park in Brooklyn.
[00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.780]   If I go into the Prospect Park today
[00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.600]   with the mindset that like I'm looking to be educated,
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.660]   I'm looking to learn, I'm looking to have my mind expanded,
[00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.040]   I'm going to have some interaction,
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.420]   whether it's, you know,
[00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.080]   staring at a Cardinal for 20 minutes
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.660]   or watching a couple hanging out on the lawn
[00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.940]   or, you know, playing with a random dog
[00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.300]   that's going to like make me feel good
[00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.620]   and make me feel fulfilled.
[00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.000]   And I really firmly believe
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.540]   that it really starts with mindset,
[00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.660]   which loops all back to that idea of like,
[00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.260]   why are you traveling?
[00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.900]   And if you go in with the right mindset,
[00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:59.740]   it doesn't matter.
[00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.380]   Honestly, it doesn't really matter where you're going.
[00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.620]   You're going to have your mind blown in some way.
[00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:04.980]   - So I want to dig into that process.
[00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.860]   But before I want to mention,
[00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.660]   well, I don't know if the average listener
[00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.540]   is thinking of Reddit as social media.
[00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.700]   I want to plug it because I use it a lot for travel.
[00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.620]   And I just did one quick search and I said, you know,
[00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.700]   "European wine tour site colon reddit.com."
[00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.860]   And it's like crowdsourcing my wine tasting trip
[00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:22.920]   to Europe, who's got suggestions.
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.400]   There aren't a lot of comments, unfortunately,
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.360]   but the person who wrote it
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.960]   came up with all these suggestions that include
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.240]   Slovenia and Croatia and Alto Adige,
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.340]   which I don't even know where that is.
[00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.360]   - Alto Adige, yeah, it's like northern Italy, I think, yeah.
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.200]   - So this at least had a bunch of suggestions,
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.360]   even though there weren't a lot of comments.
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.720]   So I use that a lot.
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.640]   - I do too, and actually it's a great example.
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.320]   I, during the pandemic,
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.520]   I feel like you're going to end this podcast
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.960]   being like this guy's obsessed with bikes,
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:52.960]   like shut up about bikes.
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.200]   But I like went down serious rabbit hole with cycling
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.680]   and bike, especially bike travel.
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.320]   Like I'm not really interested in the, you know,
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.800]   head to toe Lycra racing stuff.
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.960]   Like I'm, I love traveling by bike
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.520]   'cause I think it like slows you down.
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.160]   You really get to notice a lot.
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.040]   It's just a great way to like feel,
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.880]   get the feel of the place.
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.920]   But I really went down a rabbit hole during the pandemic
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.580]   because I was stuck at home like everyone else.
[00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:19.760]   I don't, I live in New York City.
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:20.940]   I don't own a car.
[00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.120]   So I was like looking at ways
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.400]   to tap into this idea of adventure
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.120]   and travel while still being close to home
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.680]   and doing it with the tools that I had,
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.880]   which was a bicycle.
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.600]   And Reddit was like a goldmine for that kind of stuff.
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.520]   I just, as an example,
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:40.560]   I remember finding someone talking about the route vert,
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.940]   butchering that French, but it means the green route.
[00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.040]   And it's like a network of trails
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.060]   and routes in Quebec and Canada.
[00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.480]   Never would have thought of it.
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:53.640]   Like my knowledge and desire and understanding of Quebec
[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.800]   starts and ends with Montreal, like it has for a long time.
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.240]   And then suddenly reading about this network
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.000]   of hundreds and hundreds of miles of trails
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.140]   that exist in Quebec,
[00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.880]   started talking to my partner and we're like,
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.920]   you know, I hear the border's about to reopen with Canada.
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.560]   What if we just went and did this trip
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.000]   that I like saw on Reddit?
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.200]   And we're like, okay, well, we don't have a car,
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.660]   but what if we took the train with our bikes
[00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.260]   as far North as it goes,
[00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:19.580]   and then got on our bikes from there
[00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.180]   and rode across the border into Canada
[00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:22.700]   and did the trip that way,
[00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:23.980]   which is exactly what we ended up doing.
[00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.740]   We took the train to St. Albans, Vermont,
[00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.580]   literally spent the night in Vermont,
[00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.180]   left that morning, rode to Canada,
[00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.220]   and then spent a week riding around Quebec
[00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:34.340]   and then rode back to Vermont and took the train home,
[00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:35.560]   all without ever getting in the car.
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.420]   I wrote about it on Lonely Planet's website actually,
[00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:39.660]   but it's a great example of something
[00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:41.860]   that just like started with like a tiny little spark
[00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.980]   of being like, huh, the green route Quebec,
[00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:45.260]   like sounds kind of magical.
[00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.580]   Like, I wonder if we could do it.
[00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:49.380]   Next thing I know, a few weeks later,
[00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:52.280]   we're on a train with our bikes on our way up to Canada.
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:55.540]   So that just goes to show, I think,
[00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.980]   like how the germ of something,
[00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:59.980]   if you have the right curiosity and the right mindset
[00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:03.140]   could turn into like a really great adventure.
[00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:04.800]   - I think there's two things to take away there
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:05.640]   that you didn't mention.
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:10.220]   One, I imagine that was a pretty inexpensive trip
[00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:11.580]   for something you described.
[00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:13.560]   You describe it in a way that people talk about
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.180]   these once-in-a-lifetime adventures
[00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:16.840]   that they plan for years and years
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.740]   and they spend thousands of dollars.
[00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:19.900]   That doesn't sound like something
[00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.660]   that took a lot of advance notice
[00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:23.780]   or a lot of money to make happen.
[00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:25.260]   - We didn't know where we were staying every night.
[00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:26.580]   Like it was one of those kinds of trips.
[00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:29.100]   And it was amazing 'cause you could do that
[00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:29.980]   in a place like Quebec.
[00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:33.240]   We'd be like, oh, we're starting to get a little tired.
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.460]   We've been riding for 60 miles.
[00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:36.220]   It looks like a storm's coming in.
[00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:37.200]   Pull out my phone and be like,
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.520]   what's the nearest bed and breakfast?
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:39.360]   Give them a call.
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.660]   They're like, yeah, of course, come on through.
[00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:41.700]   Next thing you know, we're staying there.
[00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:45.320]   So, and I think that's a great point that you make
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:49.940]   that like, one, that these kind of big,
[00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.840]   this is actually the point that I make in my story too,
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:55.640]   where like you think of like the capital B, capital T,
[00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:58.560]   big trip as something that you spend years
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.280]   thinking about, planning every moment.
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.280]   You know, you're gonna go on a safari.
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:05.760]   You're gonna go climb to Everest Base Camp.
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:07.920]   You're gonna do these huge things, which is great.
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.160]   And those have a place.
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.840]   And those kind of big goals are important.
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.960]   But what this taught me at least was that a big trip
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.720]   can come from like a small idea.
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:21.440]   A big trip can be something that is largely improvised.
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.560]   It can be serendipitous, it can be spontaneous.
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.740]   Again, I really do think it comes down to mindset.
[00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:29.760]   I think we could have gone into that panicking
[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:32.080]   about not having a place to stay, tired.
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:33.080]   You know, we got rained on.
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.440]   We had flat tires, all this stuff.
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.000]   But because we had the attitude where we're like,
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:37.840]   this is an adventure.
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.880]   Like, what, this is like, we've been cooped up at home
[00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:41.480]   for a year and a half because of the pandemic.
[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:43.200]   And now we're out here doing this amazing thing.
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.040]   Like, how lucky are we?
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.600]   And because we came in with that attitude,
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:49.360]   it just turned into like a really fulfilling,
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.800]   if exhausting, adventure.
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.560]   - You know, it was kind of in your backyard per se, right?
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.620]   It wasn't directly there, but you took a train.
[00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:56.920]   You didn't have to cross an ocean.
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:58.840]   You didn't have to spend thousands on plane tickets.
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:02.120]   So, you know, I think a lot of times everyone
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:04.120]   plans vacations like, gosh, where can I go?
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.680]   That's, you know, halfway around the world.
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.240]   And it's cool to hear that, you know,
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:10.200]   If you just think about it, you might find something not too far away.
