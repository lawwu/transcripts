[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.040]   - This is part of my gripe with the FIRE movement.
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.280]   Now, I'll caveat, so I was in a documentary on it,
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.720]   this documentary playing with FIRE.
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:14.840]   I'm guessing you've seen it,
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.360]   'cause a lot of the community has watched it.
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.160]   If anyone hasn't, I'll link to it in the show notes.
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.560]   But, you know, in the recent past,
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.280]   especially through your book,
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.480]   I really struggle with the RE part,
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.080]   like this idea that we should get all this money
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.380]   so that we can stop working and just kind of do nothing
[00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.160]   or travel or whatever it is.
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.120]   And I think the word retirement is too messy.
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.580]   And for me, it actually, you know,
[00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.740]   many people I think say, "Oh, retirement, no more work."
[00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.680]   For me, I think if we could reframe that concept
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.080]   as financial independence is just when money
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.080]   lets you do the thing you wanna do.
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.120]   And if you're already doing it,
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.520]   then you already are, you know, like you said,
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.340]   you know, if you had been a hospice doctor
[00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.180]   from the beginning,
[00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.280]   you would have been financially independent, you know,
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.520]   out of medical school,
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.180]   or maybe once you paid your medical bills, but maybe not.
[00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.160]   And so that stresses me out,
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.160]   thinking about people trying to have this goal
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.640]   of just doing nothing.
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.480]   What do you think?
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.200]   How do you feel about that RE part of the movement?
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.800]   - So I think that was both the greatest thing
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:19.640]   for the movement,
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.520]   'cause it made it exciting and fun to talk about,
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.360]   but also the most detrimental to the real message.
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.060]   Because the real message is not retire early.
[00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.440]   Most of us got here
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.420]   because we actually enjoy some kind of work.
[00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.680]   And I think we find purpose in work.
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.680]   The point being is that what really matters
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.920]   is not whether you're working or not,
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.560]   because I think we work most of our lives,
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.840]   and I think most of us enjoy doing some kind of work.
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.200]   It's more about the autonomy,
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.080]   and the mastery, and the independence,
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.120]   all those things that make us feel good about.
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.040]   I think that's what,
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.160]   when we're talking about retiring early,
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.560]   we're not really talking about not doing things,
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.920]   we're talking about reclaiming our control
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.480]   of doing things that make us feel good.
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.280]   Those things may actually create money.
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.120]   Often they do,
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.200]   or create some kind of content or product, right?
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.400]   We build something, we make something, we write something.
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.580]   This is all very important to our sense of identity,
[00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.160]   and our sense of waking up in the morning,
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.640]   and feeling like we have something productive,
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.900]   and exciting to do.
[00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.600]   But what we're really looking for is control.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.100]   Control and independence.
[00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.360]   And so it's really,
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.680]   you get to financial independence,
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.920]   and then you have control of what type of work you do,
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.600]   when you do it,
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.080]   and what the end goal of that work is.
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.040]   And that's something that most people feel is lacking
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.640]   in traditional employment today.
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.800]   - Yeah, I would challenge anyone listening,
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.320]   that feels like they want to achieve
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.920]   this kind of fire journey goal,
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.320]   to stop worrying about trying to save enough
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.640]   that you could stop working for the rest of your life.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.000]   I think what you said about people often end up
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.240]   being able to monetize whatever they would do
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.780]   if they stopped working, is very true.
[00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:57.920]   So I try to challenge people to say,
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.720]   what if you just took a year?
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.160]   Took a year off, did the thing you love.
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.720]   I think for a good number of people, not everyone,
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.080]   but for a good number of people they'd find within a year,
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.200]   that thing that they love actually does generate income.
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.760]   And all of the math of,
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.380]   oh, I need to save enough to live on 4%.
[00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.640]   Well, that's true if you're not working.
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.480]   But that goal of maybe, if you're on the coast,
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.140]   maybe you think you need $10 million,
[00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.680]   but if you take a year off,
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.360]   find out that the thing you love doing makes more than $0.
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.280]   Well, then the amount you actually need to do that full time
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.080]   could be half of what you need.
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.280]   It could be nothing because it makes enough money
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.040]   to sustain your lifestyle.
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.440]   So I think that far too often we assume that in retirement,
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.720]   we make no money.
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.760]   When in reality, if your retirement
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.100]   is just doing something you would do for free,
[00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.420]   many of us can get paid to do that thing also.
[00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.240]   And it changes the entire equation.
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.200]   - When I have these conversations,
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.640]   I wanna be really clear about this
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.360]   'cause people look at my story and even probably your story,
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.720]   a lot of our stories and people say,
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.860]   well, duh, it's really easy to say that
[00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.200]   when you have money, right?
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.080]   You have space, you've made money,
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.040]   you have savings, you have investments.
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.440]   It's really easy for you to say these things,
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.120]   but I'm a 22 year old out of college.
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.280]   I have just enough money to cover my rent.
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.920]   I'm barely putting food on the table.
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:20.980]   It might be easy for you,
[00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:22.860]   but for me, I don't have time to do all this stuff.
[00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.540]   And this is the conversation I really wanna have, right?
[00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.700]   Because again, it's easy for us in our 40s and our 50s
[00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.460]   when we have some savings to start talking about meaning
[00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.420]   and purpose and side hustling and monetizing things
[00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.300]   so that we can stop doing what we don't like.
[00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.900]   But the 20 year olds,
[00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.180]   the people who are struggling to put money on the table
[00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.120]   are looking at us and saying,
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.820]   yeah, that's a real privileged version of life
[00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.580]   that we don't have.
[00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.120]   But I wanna start thinking about those people too,
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.960]   'cause I think it's really important.
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.880]   We talk about money as if it is the and only tool,
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.400]   but the truth of the matter is we have lots of tools
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.280]   that help us live a purposeful and meaningful life.
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.840]   So if you were 22, you just got out of school
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.240]   or you didn't go to school and you're just working
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.160]   that eight to six barely getting by,
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.520]   and you're like, I don't have space in my life
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.360]   for side hustles.
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.880]   I don't have space in my life for these things.
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.600]   I would like to look at those people and say,
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.140]   well, money is one tool, but again, you have other tools.
[00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:20.980]   You've got your energy, you've got your youth,
[00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.520]   you've got your communities, you've got your skills.
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.500]   So maybe you work your eight to six Monday through Friday,
[00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.320]   and then on Saturday night for three hours,
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.180]   pick something you're really passionate about
[00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.420]   and start a side hustle, right?
[00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.120]   Three hours on a Saturday.
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.060]   Let's see what happens with this.
