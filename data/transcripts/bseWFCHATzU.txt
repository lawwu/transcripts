[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Alright, welcome to Game Time with Grandpa Lex.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.080]   I'm not sure if it's of use to anyone,
[00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.960]   but this is a record of my brief travels
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.960]   to the year 2077 in the cyberpunk universe.
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.160]   I sadly don't have time to play games these days,
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.380]   but they've been a source of a lot of pleasure
[00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.760]   throughout my life, so life's too short.
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.080]   Might as well enjoy it every once in a while.
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.680]   I'll try to do this once or twice a month,
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.520]   but if we're being honest, 2021 is looking quite insane.
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.440]   The next one I wanna try is Stanley Parable,
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.240]   which is the opposite of cyberpunk.
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.480]   It's only like a 15 minute game
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.080]   that you play through several times.
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.080]   I think cyberpunk 2077 is supposed to be a game
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.440]   you could play if you do all the side quests.
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.080]   You should be able to play for at least 100 hours.
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.600]   So I'm only gonna do about two, three,
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.400]   maybe four hours today and that's it.
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.320]   I'm gonna walk away.
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.280]   Nobody walks away from a good RPG.
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.800]   Well, I'm gonna walk away, friends.
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.240]   It's called discipline.
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.840]   All right, here we go.
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.320]   Oh, and please check out our sponsors in the description,
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.360]   Theragun and Grammarly.
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.260]   So one is for your muscles and the other is for your grammar.
[00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.420]   The choice is yours, my friends.
[00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.360]   Choose wisely.
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.800]   Please check them out in the description to get a discount
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.120]   and to support the podcast that I host.
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.120]   All right, here we go.
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.760]   New game, Cyberpunk 2077,
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.900]   released just like a couple hours ago.
[00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.180]   Let's go.
[00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.660]   Select difficulty level.
[00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.580]   Most things in life, I will go very hard.
[00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.780]   For me, normal is probably the equivalent
[00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.980]   of what very hard is for most gamers.
[00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.540]   I really haven't played video games in a long, long time.
[00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.020]   All right, normal is enemies will have all the tools
[00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.940]   at their disposal to take V on.
[00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.180]   V is the name of the character, I suppose.
[00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.740]   But primarily only enemies at a higher level
[00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.440]   will prove a challenge.
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.620]   Easy is the right choice for players
[00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.220]   who just want to sit back and enjoy the story.
[00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.860]   Combat will not pose a challenge.
[00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.500]   Ooh, as you get older,
[00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.820]   you learn to appreciate the story, not the combat.
[00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.100]   What would David Goggins do?
[00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.660]   David Goggins probably go very hard
[00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.020]   and lose within five minutes and then go run.
[00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.120]   Okay, let's go normal.
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:22.060]   Nomad, Street Kid, or Corpo.
[00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.420]   So many decisions.
[00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.640]   Select V's life path.
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.640]   Some events and dialogue options in the game
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.840]   will be different depending on your choice.
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.180]   Nomad is roaming the badlands, looting scrapyards,
[00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.040]   raiding fuel depots.
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.420]   Life on the road wasn't easy.
[00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.080]   But growing up in Nomad clan has its perks.
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.240]   Honesty, integrity, and a love of freedom.
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.120]   Qualities that few in Night City possess
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.800]   and no amount of money can buy.
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.080]   I like these guys, Nomads.
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.360]   Street Kids, they say if you want to understand the streets,
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.720]   you got to live them.
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.140]   Gangs, fixtures, dolls, small time pushers,
[00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.120]   you were raised by them all.
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.840]   Down here, the law of the jungle dictates
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.180]   the weak serve the strong.
[00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.260]   The only law in Night City you have yet to break.
[00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.880]   The weak serve the strong.
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:15.960]   Think we're gonna need a couple hours
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.600]   to think about that one.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.800]   Okay, Corpo, corporate.
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.000]   Comes with a marketing team and HR.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.920]   Few leave the corporate world with their lives.
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.080]   Few are still with their souls intact.
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.240]   Amen.
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.440]   You've been there, you've bent the rules,
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.120]   exploited secrets and weaponized information.
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.380]   There's no such thing as a fair game.
[00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.280]   Only winners and losers.
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.840]   I'm pretty sure Nomad is basically where it's at.
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.000]   I wish you could wear a suit and tie as a Nomad.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.920]   Let's see if you can dress yourself.
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:50.840]   Let's go Nomad.
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.480]   Oh boy.
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.640]   Select V's body type.
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.200]   V's appearance may sometimes affect the behavior
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.360]   or other characters.
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.300]   Appearance doesn't matter, it's all about the inside.
[00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.560]   I feel very uncomfortable with the selection.
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.620]   So there's this guy with a shortcut and some red hair.
[00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.560]   Guys with some scars.
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.660]   Scars are always good, means you've lived.
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.240]   This guy's too good looking.
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.200]   Oh, this is random generation.
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:31.040]   All right, let's just keep generating random ones
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.360]   until we get close to what we're looking for.
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.540]   We want gritty, but not too pretty.
[00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.540]   (suspenseful music)
[00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:55.820]   Disturb the comfortable, nice tattoo.
[00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.260]   I think the random generation is really off.
[00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:59.660]   I think this is actually pretty close
[00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.300]   to what I'm looking for.
[00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.640]   Voice tone, masculine.
[00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:05.460]   Feminine.
[00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:14.120]   There's pronouns.
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.340]   I'm gonna go with he/him.
[00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.380]   Skin type.
[00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.240]   That's so cool.
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.900]   I love video games so much.
[00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.580]   You can define so much about the characters.
[00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:29.780]   Hairstyles.
[00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.020]   Oh man, let's go with the basics.
[00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.220]   I'm a big fan of eyes,
[00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.300]   so I think eyes truly are the window to the soul.
[00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.400]   So let's see.
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.540]   Oh, it's like, interesting.
[00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.980]   It's more like the entirety of the structure of the,
[00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.980]   okay, cool.
[00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.700]   I like the intensity of the original guy.
[00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:53.660]   Eyebrows.
[00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:58.100]   Whatever, this is good enough.
[00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.180]   It's starting to get uncomfortable.
[00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.540]   Nose, that's good enough.
[00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:03.380]   Mouth.
[00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.780]   Yep.
[00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.020]   Ears.
[00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.820]   Can you do cauliflower ears?
[00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:12.500]   This guy been in a fight?
[00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:13.340]   Come on.
[00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:20.000]   Give me some, is that a little cauliflower?
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.900]   (soft music)
[00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:35.800]   Do we really need 21 ear types?
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.320]   Beard.
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.720]   Beard is fine.
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.000]   Maybe clean shaven?
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.360]   Nah.
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.520]   Cyberware.
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.800]   I don't know.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.000]   Can you go no cyberware?
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.480]   It's kind of old school with the cyber,
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.440]   yeah, a little subtlety.
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:53.740]   Yeah, just off, okay.
[00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:57.800]   Yeah, off on the cyberware.
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.400]   We go old school.
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.760]   We like cyber, but let's keep it off the face.
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.440]   Not the face.
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:05.640]   Facial scars.
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:07.360]   Yeah, you gotta have facial scars.
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.520]   Each one of them has a,
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.960]   whoa, that's intense.
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:16.240]   That's like a tire been driven over him.
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:22.080]   I like, I like, I like this one.
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:26.600]   It's got a hit in the head with something.
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.280]   Facial tattoos, nah.
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.540]   Piercings, nah.
[00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:31.760]   Teeth.
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:32.720]   Yes, please.
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:36.560]   Oh, yeah, I'll go with the white ones.
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.320]   Oh, right, yeah.
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:39.200]   Basic teeth.
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.480]   Eye makeup color.
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:43.560]   Lip makeup.
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.800]   Cheek makeup.
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.520]   Blemishes.
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:48.720]   Nails short.
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:53.480]   Nipples on or off.
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.280]   You can turn off the nipples.
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.440]   Let's keep the nipples.
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:59.540]   Body tattoos.
[00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:02.240]   Bodies, no tattoos.
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.440]   Scars, yes.
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:07.280]   Let's go with the Bruce Lee,
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.000]   the three scratch marks.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.240]   That's either a cat or overly friendly girlfriend.
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.200]   Genitals, I'll probably edit that part out,
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.120]   but you can actually select the genitals.
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.520]   So like penis or vagina,
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.640]   and then you can select the penis size
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.160]   and the pubic hair style.
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:24.080]   It's kind of fascinating.
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:26.280]   It's an interesting design choice.
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:29.000]   But since I'm thinking of uploading this video,
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.040]   I'll keep it family friendly.
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.480]   But in case you're wondering,
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:36.440]   this character is packing some heat.
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:37.560]   Customize attributes.
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:40.360]   Choose the core attributes you want to begin with.
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:42.040]   Each attribute contains a set of skills.
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:44.200]   Both attributes and skills provide different bonuses
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.920]   depending on your style of play.
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.080]   Skill levels increases
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.560]   you perform activities associated with them.
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:51.640]   The maximum level of a skill is limited
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:54.360]   by the level of the attribute that it belongs to.
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.200]   Interesting.
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:00.840]   Body determines your raw physical power.
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:01.680]   Okay.
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:05.800]   Intelligence determines your net running proficiency.
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:06.920]   Every level of intelligence
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:09.240]   will increase cyber deck RAM capacity,
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.640]   increase quick hack damage,
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:12.800]   so basically like hacking ability.
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.080]   So computer skills,
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:15.240]   it's like Napoleon Dynamite,
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.200]   non-check skills.
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:20.000]   Reflexes determine your maneuverability.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.960]   Technical ability represents your technical know-how.
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:26.680]   It allows you to unlock doors and use tech weapons.
[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:28.400]   Cool determines your resilience,
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.680]   composure and effectiveness in operating from stealth.
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.360]   So like a stealthy type of thing.
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:37.400]   So intelligence is like the,
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:40.120]   that's the mage, the wizard.
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.400]   Body's like the warrior.
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:46.080]   Reflexes, yeah, that's like agility.
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:49.200]   Technical ability, that's lock picking.
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.320]   And then cool is like stealth,
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.200]   like lurking in the shadow.
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.240]   Probably, I'd probably go body and intelligence,
[00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:56.940]   probably emphasizing intelligence.
[00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:59.320]   So I gotta be honest with you.
[00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:03.000]   I'm not into lock picking or sneaking around.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.400]   I'm slow, hit hard,
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:10.800]   but also have reasonably okay programming ability.
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.760]   So probably gonna put everything
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:15.840]   into body and intelligence.
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.200]   Well, IRL.
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:21.640]   And since it looks like I can't spend everything
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:23.520]   on body and intelligence,
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:24.920]   ain't that the truth,
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.480]   I'll go one in reflexes.
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:31.400]   So begins your story in Night City.
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:35.120]   Alias V, backstory Nomad,
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:38.440]   attributes, we know what the attributes are.
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:41.420]   There's the scan code for the biometric data, let's go.
[00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:49.740]   User unknown, patch F, remove patch.
[00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:57.040]   Backers.
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:11.440]   Move with WSAD and look around with the mouse.
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:14.960]   That mechanic looks like a punk.
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:18.160]   Maybe I should look in the mirror.
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.240]   So how do I actually engage with him?
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:22.120]   You can cycle through dialogue choices,
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:23.560]   I guess with the mouse wheel,
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:27.360]   or up and down, calm down, brother.
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:30.920]   Okay, so now in square brackets,
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:33.000]   it says check engine and I can tell him to step aside,
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:33.840]   I'll handle it.
[00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:38.920]   Or I'm going to pay you what we agreed.
[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:40.440]   I'm gonna pay you what we agreed.
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:43.800]   - I'm gonna pay you what we agreed, not one anymore.
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:47.100]   - Huh, for that you can borrow my tools and fix it yourself.
[00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:49.960]   - All right.
[00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:50.800]   - That's fine.
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.120]   - Step aside. - Step aside.
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:53.720]   - What?
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:54.840]   - You heard me. - You have any idea
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:55.680]   what I do?
[00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:58.600]   - I think I'll bypass the coupling.
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:01.680]   - I'm gonna bypass the coupling and rig a hotwire.
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.760]   - Compressor will run on and on.
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:04.600]   - Put these on.
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.380]   - I know what I'm doing.
[00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:10.580]   Did he ask your opinion?
[00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:11.420]   I like this guy.
[00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:15.940]   Satan, maids of Satan.
[00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:22.020]   So the exclamation points is get in the car.
[00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:23.060]   So those are the things,
[00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:26.660]   those are like quests or instructions, get in, F.
[00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:28.620]   Cool, let's go.
[00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:30.860]   - Okay, let's see what happens.
[00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:33.060]   - Start engine.
[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:36.640]   (engine revving)
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:39.760]   Love the sound of this car.
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:42.240]   - It'll get me to Night City.
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.320]   I figure something else out there.
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:46.620]   - Connect to radio station, yes please.
[00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:53.840]   - Antenna on this heap don't seem like it packs a punch.
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:55.480]   Not liable to hear much.
[00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:56.460]   - You don't say.
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.360]   - Hey Mike, didn't know you had a customer.
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.760]   - Rolled in a few hours past.
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.480]   I thought he'd at least called in today.
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:10.920]   - Don't you sweat it, Mike.
[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:12.120]   We're gonna hash it out.
[00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:14.160]   - I like this town.
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:18.120]   - Don't you know you owe the sheriff a word
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:20.400]   when you pay his town a visit?
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.840]   To tell him what's brought you here.
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:23.680]   - Hey big guy.
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:27.640]   I'm just passing through.
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.880]   - No need to worry, I won't be staying long.
[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:33.280]   - Didn't ask my question now, did you?
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:35.840]   - I'm here alone.
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:36.760]   I travel alone.
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:38.800]   - There is no clan, there is no camp.
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.040]   I'm here alone.
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:43.560]   - Closed door, I don't want any trouble.
[00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:45.120]   I don't think I want any trouble.
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.960]   Not afraid of it, just don't want trouble with this guy.
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.560]   He seems like a small fish.
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.840]   - Get it clear, I don't want any trouble.
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:54.520]   - Then stop looking for it and hit the road.
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:55.960]   - All right, calm down buddy.
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:57.620]   Drive out the garage, W.
[00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:00.700]   (car engine roaring)
[00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:03.500]   Okay.
[00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:04.940]   Vehicle steering, A and D,
[00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:07.100]   accelerate with W, brake with S, cool.
[00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:10.460]   And where do I go?
[00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:12.860]   Go to the telecom tower, okay, gotcha.
[00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:16.700]   (laughing)
[00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:18.220]   Such a boomer.
[00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:19.820]   Active job objectives are marked
[00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:22.740]   with the exclamation on the HUD.
[00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:25.700]   Okay, go to the telecom tower.
[00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:28.300]   Oh man, video games are so fun.
[00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:34.500]   You drunk, let's go home.
[00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:37.900]   So bad at this.
[00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:44.340]   Sorry, I'm paying attention to a million things.
[00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:46.180]   I'm not paying attention to the road.
[00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:52.740]   Exit vehicle, taxi vehicle, hold F.
[00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:55.480]   This game is so beautiful.
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.960]   I wanna go hiking out there.
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:00.440]   Can we just go, is that a side quest?
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:01.360]   Just go hiking.
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:05.680]   Oh, this is nice.
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:07.200]   It's freezing in Boston right now.
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:08.360]   This would be nice.
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:09.360]   Just run up that mountain,
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:13.880]   you see like David Goggins running along those mountains.
[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:15.240]   Look how beautiful that is.
[00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:18.040]   That's when you know you're getting old.
[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:19.040]   You don't wanna shoot anything,
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:21.040]   you just wanna enjoy walking around,
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:22.760]   looking at the beautiful scenery.
[00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.800]   All right, F, enter.
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.080]   What do you want from me?
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:32.640]   Kick it in, you gotta kick it in.
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:39.160]   Climb the telecom tower and locate the control box.
[00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:45.720]   Hopefully this is not nauseating to watch.
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:48.560]   Oh, let's see.
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:50.880]   How do you, oh, cool.
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:53.200]   (footsteps)
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:16:01.040]   Very rusty with this whole video game thing.
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:04.480]   Open, oh, that's not the button.
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:06.080]   I'm also using a Kinesis keyboard,
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.360]   which is really hard to press stuff with.
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:11.440]   Connect to radio.
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:16.640]   This is ground control to Major Tom.
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.320]   - Come in, come in.
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:20.840]   - I'm raised to finally.
[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:24.400]   - Willie McCoy, it's good to hear your voice.
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:28.240]   - Fee, wish I could say the same.
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:34.160]   - I need your help.
[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:35.920]   - I need your help.
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.200]   - Look at that. - One last time.
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.040]   - Look at that car driving over there.
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:40.200]   - One last time, again?
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.040]   - Yes.
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:42.920]   - I have to find the client with my payload,
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:44.360]   but I don't know where he is.
[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:48.520]   - Hmm, right place, right time.
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:49.360]   You were there?
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:52.560]   - Of course.
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:54.200]   - Of course I was.
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:56.360]   Maybe the client left a message.
[00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:57.520]   Could you check for me?
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:01.520]   - Hmm, sure.
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:04.120]   Last time though, I mean it.
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:05.760]   Client's name?
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:06.880]   - Jackie Wells.
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:13.080]   - Huh, actually left a message.
[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:17.040]   He's waiting on a farm, flicking you the geoloc data.
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:17.880]   - Cool.
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:19.800]   - Thanks, Willie, I owe you one.
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:21.920]   - This is the Keanu Reeves character, I think.
[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:23.000]   - Don't get yourself killed.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.080]   - Don't get yourself killed.
[00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:25.040]   - Don't call again.
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:29.480]   - Wow, that sounds like every time I talk to my parents.
[00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:36.560]   I'm terrified of heights, even in a video game, so.
[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:41.160]   This is very stressful.
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:44.240]   Look at this thing.
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:46.920]   Definitely not a Tesla.
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:49.880]   Maybe a Cybertruck.
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:52.640]   Like a really beat up Cybertruck.
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:57.360]   I love that sound.
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:58.640]   Head to the meeting place.
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:09.320]   Wow, what, how old are you that you're driving like this?
[00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:12.040]   It's hard with the Kinesis keyboard, that's my excuse.
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:15.440]   Plus I don't wanna go slowly, I wanna go fast.
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:18.520]   (car engine revving)
[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:21.960]   So soon.
[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:23.960]   This is Jacques Valjean.
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:25.760]   All I was doing is driving, sir.
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:27.680]   Okay, police introduction.
[00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:31.600]   Any illegal activity such as theft or attacking civilians
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:34.800]   will result in an NCPD placing a bounty on you.
[00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:37.360]   The police will send a patrol to the crime scene
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.360]   and the strength of the response will be proportionate
[00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.320]   to the size of the bounty to lose.
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.600]   The police move away from the crime scene
[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:45.320]   and lay low for a while.
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:47.680]   So it's kinda like GTA Grand Theft Auto.
[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:54.760]   Sorry, I'm really sorry, I was just driving, sir.
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:59.920]   They're shooting at me.
[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:01.560]   I should've gone with the easy level.
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:02.920]   I just wanted to go hiking.
[00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:07.200]   This is so bad.
[00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:08.960]   It's really sensitive, okay?
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:12.360]   In meat space, I'm used to the car
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:14.320]   not being so sensitive to my keyboard.
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:17.960]   I'm gonna head to the meat place.
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:20.360]   I don't know any of the keyboard shortcuts
[00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:22.040]   of how to look behind me.
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:28.720]   Get out of the car.
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:31.440]   This is very stressful.
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:33.680]   F, I'm getting out of the car.
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:34.840]   You told me to get out of the car.
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.720]   I'm getting out of the car.
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:37.560]   Are you?
[00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:42.240]   Oh, you have to hold F, cool.
[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:44.080]   Me, Jackie Wells.
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:45.400]   All right, Keanu, let's go.
[00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:46.240]   Where you at?
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:54.080]   Okay, I guess this is not the Keanu Reeves character.
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:57.120]   Are you Jackie Wells?
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:10.560]   Good man.

[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:55.240]   couldn't get made fun of so much for this driving
[00:21:55.240 --> 00:22:05.160]   back in my day we used to play Prince of Persia you had to just exist in a
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:10.240]   two-dimensional world I was just scrolling from left to right
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:14.800]   listen friend we're both professionals a week
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:19.400]   this is such a beautiful game I look at the city in the background sure you've
[00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:24.240]   moved contraband before why nervous
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:30.880]   look at this world it feels like a coronavirus time to
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:36.400]   deserted the wind is blowing I love this
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:44.320]   drive to the border hey what are you games are so amazing what now nothing

[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:59.320]   to the inspection area I think that was just
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:06.000]   I got a real bad feeling about this
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:13.560]   take document hand me the fan I mean the manifest don't need to see it
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:22.480]   grab these let me see it's marked L away perfect what's that mean lost an arrival
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:26.680]   it means the cargo is flagged as to be lost as soon as across the border
[00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:34.080]   oh they know we're smuggling they're about to find out look at the dog
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:42.400]   bobblehead you have bribe money customs officer to turn a blind eye to our
[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:46.520]   dubious docu's will need a sweetener do you have the credit chip with the bribe

[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:26.640]   someone's coming our way sensitive so tough exterior sensitive so
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:30.840]   immediately let's get out of here on it
[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:36.360]   you are transporting contraband that is corporate property given how bad I was a
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:41.120]   driving I'm probably even worse at shooting
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:49.000]   draw weapon is alt can use this keyboard man
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:59.800]   this is fun to shoot okay
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:02.600]   yeah actually

[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:31.600]   thought I hit him in the head still okay like I guess the game where you hit the
[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:37.200]   person that doesn't kill them
[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:45.600]   very stressful I don't like shooting at the police at this difficult tenth time
[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:48.400]   in 2020
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:54.440]   I'm a huge supporter of the police one of the hardest jobs I apologize for
[00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:58.800]   shooting at them in this artificially constructed world of
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:01.720]   2077
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:08.800]   I'm also realizing my mouth

[00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:07.480]   okay partner time to grab a man to man
[00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:14.640]   chick we're looking for somewhere in this building probably crawling with the
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:20.880]   pin there was the kidnapper I Japan town half a year later speaking of which got
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:26.640]   you a little something well the tech training shard in case you need to brush
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:32.880]   up on your dance moves all right let's do a little tutorial still a shooting
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:38.280]   practice I guess it is wait where am I plugging that in what where did I just
[00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:53.120]   plug that in this is some Neuralink type of text yellow gun not my style well
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:58.280]   have to do what am I doing shoot all the targets okay
[00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:08.080]   okay we crank it up a notch with the next round the targets
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:25.080]   that's terrible take proceed to crouch and hide behind cover cover can protect
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:45.600]   you from enemy fire oh headshot does matter got it how do you do that you're
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:51.600]   injured if your health falls to zero you die use the inhaler to your gain health
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:55.480]   when you pick up a consumable it will automatically be added to the
[00:32:55.480 --> 00:33:02.920]   consumables quick slot in your inventory if empty press X now to use one of the
[00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:13.320]   regain okay cool where's the health switching weapons press one two three or
[00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:21.280]   four or the switch weapons cool I should also say that I haven't played
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:28.880]   shooters very much so I'm really terrible shooters okay cool so maybe
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:31.320]   you mean
[00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:48.840]   hacking's the next item on the menu I like this lady hacking cool let's begin
[00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:54.280]   training I wonder if she's a robot scanning highlights objects of interest
[00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:59.480]   in your surroundings it provides valuable information about them cool
[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:04.680]   hazards are highlighted in red hackable objects are highlighted in green objects
[00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:08.000]   useful in other ways are highlighted in blue release tab to exit the scanner
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.320]   cool
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:17.440]   with a cyberdeck installed your scanner provides an additional interface for
[00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:21.440]   selecting quick hacks and their targets use distract enemies to distract the
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:28.400]   guard navigate the list of available quick hacks with the mouse wheel
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:36.280]   duration 30 seconds cool down zero seconds upload time 1.4 34 seconds
[00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:40.680]   causes a device to malfunction resulting in erratic behavior that will distract
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:45.880]   nearby people Wow so hacking is a big part of this game that's interesting and
[00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:50.800]   intelligence is a part of hacking so I'm glad I invested in intelligence not all
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:59.040]   about brute force I guess the body helped with the kicking down the door
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:06.160]   this game is cool probably way too complicated okay sneak up to the guard
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:17.760]   got it good I got take him out quietly all right all yours take him out
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:26.200]   kill of course never smart to leave behind this is an alternate reality where
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:34.000]   murder is supposedly allowed now pick up the body and hide it somewhere pick up
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.640]   the body approach it closely look at it and hold our sometimes a dirty deed must
[00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:46.840]   be done you can hide dead and unconscious in certain places doing so
[00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:53.080]   will help you avoid detection by other enemies got it
[00:35:55.920 --> 00:36:02.720]   up off in the dumpster you go I'm sorry friend but this is just virtual reality
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:19.000]   now try to take him down in one I want to see what technique he used
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:26.040]   time to get down and dirty in close-quarter combat tap to perform a
[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:35.040]   fast attack hit the enemy three times with fast attacks got it to perform a
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:40.080]   fast attack combo press the left mouse button while the previous fast attack is
[00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:48.580]   executed hold the left mouse button to charge a strong attack then release it
[00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:56.560]   to perform it cool let's go yeah use the techniques you've learned so far to
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:37:14.280]   defeat the enemy and here I am using none of the techniques nice the melee
[00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:17.520]   combat techniques you've learned can also be used with melee weapons such as
[00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:26.800]   a katana okay I can block cool
[00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:32.360]   cool very easy
[00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:34.400]   oh
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:07.760]   good stuff looks like you're cruising already she looks proud of me now we can
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:18.760]   get down to business time to work let's do this this is such a fun escape from
[00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:28.160]   the real world unfortunately I probably only got an hour maybe two most I guess
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:33.280]   there's a lot of pre story to get through here I mean I didn't get much at
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:39.120]   all into the main quest yes hi what are you looking at

[00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:30.200]   [Music]
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:33.280]   [Music]

[00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:09.600]   anti-chemicants and fabric tank top
[00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:11.600]   alright, he'll take everything
[00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:13.600]   I'm sorry buddy

[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:17.600]   let's take the guns
[00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:29.600]   oh, this thing is...
[00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:31.600]   (gunshots)
[00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:47.600]   don't see any movement on the sensors
[00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:48.600]   looks like you got him
[00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:50.600]   you're clear to go
[00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:52.600]   find Sandra Dorsett
[00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:56.600]   what's up Jackie, how you doing brother?
[00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:00.600]   we should do a podcast after this
[00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:02.600]   oh, there's two of them
[00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:11.600]   wow
[00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:27.600]   they don't look too friendly
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:29.600]   let's go
[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:49.600]   yeah, let's go
[00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:57.600]   she sounds like a nice lady
[00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:06.600]   ah, these cars are badass
[00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:08.600]   reminds me of Back to the Future
[00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:12.600]   even though this is the future
[00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:16.600]   it sure looks like the 80's
[00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:26.600]   good music
[00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:29.600]   beautiful graphics
[00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:32.600]   this is ultra realistic
[00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:37.600]   I could tell I could probably spend like a hundred plus hours here just exploring the city
[00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:55.600]   there's a mix of LA, there's a mix of Vegas
[00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:58.600]   deserted
[00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:01.600]   I wanna take a piss
[00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:04.600]   come on V
[00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:06.600]   get down on the ground
[00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:12.600]   hold tight V
[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:24.600]   got you asshole
[00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:26.600]   V, aim for the driver
[00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:28.600]   shoot him
[00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:34.600]   got him
[00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:37.600]   this game so far is a lot more shooting than RPG
[00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:43.600]   it really gives me the Grand Theft Auto vibes
[00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:47.600]   which, you know, it's fun but
[00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:51.600]   like I said, I'm much more Elder Scrolls kind of guy
[00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:57.600]   I guess this is a good little experiment about what it's like to play games, to comment, and so on
[00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:00.600]   what is it that makes me so special?
[00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:03.600]   a heart of gold
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:09.600]   cause only somebody with a heart of gold can understand just how much I need to get back to my girl
[00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:11.600]   you're... girl?
[00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:14.600]   I told you, Jackie's a sweetheart, romantic
[00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:16.600]   sure
[00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:21.600]   probably cries during Notebook
[00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:23.600]   that's a shame
[00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:25.600]   let us through please
[00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:29.600]   let's see if kindness gets us through
[00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:35.600]   she's nice
[00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:40.600]   can we just ride with Jackie, listen to Led Zeppelin
[00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:43.600]   and not shoot anybody, can we do that?
[00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:49.600]   so you can be nice, amen
[00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:53.600]   I'm always never not nice
[00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:59.600]   it's pretty good dialogue, pretty good conversation
[00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:02.600]   I like this place, I like this game
[00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:06.600]   it's gonna be sad to say goodbye
[00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:08.600]   alright
[00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:11.600]   nice handshake
[00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:16.600]   I'm gonna be nice, amen
[00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:18.600]   bye later
[00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:21.600]   go home?
[00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:24.600]   it's good to be home
[00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:30.600]   this is my apartment
[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:36.600]   this is the opposite of what my apartment looks like
[00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:38.600]   this is way too nice
[00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:41.600]   so I can sleep, check your weapons stash
[00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:43.600]   and then go to bed
[00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:47.600]   alright
[00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:49.600]   where's the computer?
[00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:52.600]   how are you supposed to do any kind of programming?
[00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:54.600]   it's just guns
[00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:57.600]   go to bed, let's go to bed
[00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:10.600]   it's actually, currently 3am in Boston
[00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:14.600]   so it's actually getting about that time, close to bed
[00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:20.600]   act 1, ok, maybe I'll do one quest and that'll be it for this game
[00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:24.600]   it'll be time to say goodbye
[00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:27.600]   the graphics, the characters
[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:31.600]   I can tell I would love this game, it's a beautiful place
[00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:33.600]   to visit
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:36.600]   part of me is actually really enjoying the fact that
[00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:39.600]   I can just see people, they're not wearing masks
[00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:42.600]   we're in proximity, we can just
[00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:46.600]   explore the depth that is each other's weirdness
[00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:51.600]   oh man, this feels surprisingly good, just to be among people
[00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:53.600]   even if it's in a virtual world
[00:47:53.600 --> 00:48:00.600]   these people are awesome
[00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:05.600]   oh man, I can't wait till things open back up and you can just meet people and talk to people
[00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:10.600]   look at this, look at this city
[00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:12.600]   wow
[00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:14.600]   wow
[00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:23.600]   this is very Grand Theft Auto-ish
[00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:27.600]   what's the job exactly?
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:36.600]   system malfunction
[00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:40.600]   are these part of the game or is this like the bugs that everyone's talking about?
[00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:43.600]   alright, let's do it
[00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:49.600]   god, the graphics, even at this level
[00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:51.600]   I don't have it on ultra, I have it on high
[00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:54.600]   and this is 1080p I think
[00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:56.600]   still, so awesome
[00:48:56.600 --> 00:49:00.600]   look at it, you can see like the freckles on his face
[00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:02.600]   so awesome
[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:04.600]   *laughs*
[00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:11.600]   you have to stop for pedestrians
[00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:13.600]   oh man
[00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:14.600]   I'm so-
[00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:17.600]   that's not very nice
[00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:25.600]   I'm not very good at any of this, I apologize
[00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:33.600]   this car is pretty badass, that I know for sure
[00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:48.600]   Victor's Clinic
[00:49:53.600 --> 00:50:01.600]   *reads instructions on screen*
[00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:05.600]   those are the future versions of neurosurgeons I suppose
[00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:16.600]   *reads instructions on screen*
[00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:20.600]   this is awesome
[00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:23.600]   this is where the surgery happens
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:25.600]   alright, what's up buddy
[00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:34.600]   Neurosocket
[00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:48.600]   *reads instructions on screen*
[00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:52.600]   ooh, looking to upgrade
[00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:56.600]   looking to upgrade, do I want to upgrade?
[00:50:56.600 --> 00:51:00.600]   *reads instructions on screen*
[00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:11.600]   *reads instructions on screen*
[00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:19.600]   let's go back to the standing desk
[00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:21.600]   alright
[00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:27.600]   *reads instructions on screen*
[00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:31.600]   I wonder if that's the bugs they were talking about
[00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:40.600]   *laughs* so cool, he's gonna upgrade the eyes
[00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:42.600]   that is awesome
[00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:45.600]   I got Lasik surgery by the way
[00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:47.600]   best thing I've ever done
[00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:50.600]   alright, let's put it in
[00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:55.600]   although I don't really trust a neurosurgeon with rolled up sleeve and the
[00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:57.600]   sleeve tattoos
[00:51:57.600 --> 00:52:06.600]   *laughs*
[00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:09.600]   I wonder if the folks in Eurolink, any of them
[00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:11.600]   play this game and what they think
[00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:12.600]   this is funny
[00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:24.600]   *reads instructions on screen*
[00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:36.600]   *reads instructions on screen*
[00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:38.600]   let's continue
[00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:41.600]   ocular systems
[00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:43.600]   operating systems
[00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:47.600]   god, imagine this is the future
[00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:50.600]   this is what upgrades look like
[00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:54.600]   of course, if it in fact costs money
[00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:56.600]   then of course the elite people
[00:52:56.600 --> 00:52:59.600]   that inherent money will be able to upgrade themselves
[00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:01.600]   and thereby increasing the gap
[00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:03.600]   between the have and have nots
[00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:05.600]   and there'll be a Bernie Sanders type of character
[00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:07.600]   who tries to fight that
[00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:10.600]   maybe the future looks a lot like the present
[00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:13.600]   ocular systems, let's go with ocular systems
[00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:16.600]   Kishore Optics, zero dollars
[00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:17.600]   cool
[00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:20.600]   I just installed some new eyes
[00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:22.600]   hands
[00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:23.600]   is this free?
[00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:24.600]   yeah, it's free
[00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:25.600]   cool
[00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:38.600]   *reads instructions on screen*
[00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:39.600]   interesting
[00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:40.600]   links the eye
[00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:42.600]   or like directly to the weapon
[00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:44.600]   wow
[00:53:44.600 --> 00:53:47.600]   links the weapon
[00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:48.600]   to your eye
[00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:51.600]   skipping the entirety of the rest of the mess of human biology
[00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:53.600]   cool, I love it
[00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:55.600]   alright
[00:53:55.600 --> 00:54:01.600]   this is cool, this gives me a little preview of this world
[00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:05.600]   if I didn't have a million things going on
[00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:07.600]   I'd stay here for a few more hours but
[00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:09.600]   nope
[00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:17.600]   good to know
[00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:27.600]   *reads instructions on screen*
[00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:28.600]   let's do it
[00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:33.600]   I wonder if they'll show the neurosurgery
[00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:46.600]   look how crappy the equipment is
[00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:51.600]   oh man, they're gonna show it aren't they
[00:54:51.600 --> 00:55:12.600]   that's what Lasik felt like
[00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:15.600]   it's like these things are going after your eye
[00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:19.600]   but you gotta trust the robotics there, you gotta trust the equipment
[00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:22.600]   and it worked out beautifully for me
[00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:26.600]   and I think it works out really well for most people
[00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:51.600]   *reads instructions on screen*
[00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:53.600]   yeah, better than ever
[00:55:53.600 --> 00:56:06.600]   *reads instructions on screen*
[00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:09.600]   cool, so this like gave me extra ability to scan
[00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:15.600]   *reads instructions on screen*
[00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:17.600]   ok well this is all stuff I already know
[00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:44.600]   *reads instructions on screen*
[00:56:44.600 --> 00:56:59.600]   *reads instructions on screen*
[00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:05.600]   this is a pretty violent world isn't it
[00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:10.600]   I'm not gonna ask what it is
[00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:25.600]   *reads instructions on screen*
[00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:26.600]   Jackie Wells
[00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:37.600]   back to Jackie
[00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:43.600]   *reads instructions on screen*
[00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:44.600]   hard chockers
[00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:54.600]   Regina Jones
[00:57:54.600 --> 00:58:10.600]   *reads instructions on screen*
[00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:11.600]   cyberpsychosis
[00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:15.600]   imagine all the psychological disorders
[00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:19.600]   that are side effects of implants
[00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:24.600]   let's get in this car
[00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:25.600]   let's get the job done
[00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:28.600]   oh is that Dex
[00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:35.600]   *reads instructions on screen*
[00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:36.600]   nice hand
[00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:48.600]   *reads instructions on screen*
[00:58:48.600 --> 00:58:49.600]   this guy's a philosopher
[00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:54.600]   how they remember you, that's all that counts
[00:58:54.600 --> 00:59:13.600]   cigar
[00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:16.600]   not at all, let's get it done
[00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:45.600]   *reads instructions on screen*
[00:59:45.600 --> 00:59:46.600]   got a beef
[00:59:46.600 --> 00:59:55.600]   this shard thing
[00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:58.600]   I wish it had a little bit more science about it
[00:59:58.600 --> 01:00:02.600]   protein processing plant
[01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:07.600]   Alpha Fold 7
[01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:36.600]   *reads instructions on screen*
[01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:40.600]   I say when, cause Brick was the leader
[01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:42.600]   three days after we'd sealed our deal
[01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:46.600]   his friend and gang mate once Simon Randall, aka Royce
[01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:48.600]   plain dropped his ass
[01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:50.600]   Royce is in charge now
[01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:54.600]   and I got no way of knowing if he aims to honor his predecessors word
[01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:56.600]   the ad of the shitstroom
[01:00:56.600 --> 01:01:01.600]   one Meredith Stout of Militech has developed an interest in said convoy
[01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:04.600]   I think I got everything
[01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:06.600]   time I got to work
[01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:08.600]   *reads instructions on screen*
[01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:10.600]   that's a friendly fella
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:20.600]   blaze of glory
[01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:29.600]   I like that guy, I like the characters this game creates
[01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:33.600]   I'm not so much for the shooting and the Grand Theft Auto style quests
[01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:34.600]   but I like
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:36.600]   I like the city
[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:38.600]   I like the people
[01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:48.600]   *reads instructions on screen*
[01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:51.600]   oh my god, I love this world
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:58.600]   let's visit Maelstrom
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:02.600]   we'll take care of that situation
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:04.600]   and then call it a wraps
[01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:09.600]   as I'm playing this now, I'm realizing how much I've changed
[01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:12.600]   relative to my ability to appreciate
[01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:15.600]   a Grand Theft Auto style game
[01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:17.600]   not loving it
[01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:21.600]   let's meet him
[01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:23.600]   let's meet him
[01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:25.600]   *reads instructions on screen*
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:31.600]   he paid up front?
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:33.600]   *reads instructions on screen*
[01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:35.600]   well, whatever
[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:37.600]   let's go get this tech
[01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:45.600]   don't know you
[01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:51.600]   wanna talk to Royce
[01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:53.600]   *reads instructions on screen*
[01:02:53.600 --> 01:03:03.600]   lots of books just laying around
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:07.600]   alright
[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:09.600]   let's meet this fella
[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:11.600]   *reads instructions on screen*
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:13.600]   *reads instructions on screen*
[01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:41.600]   this is gonna be a lot of combat
[01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:10.600]   I like these couches
[01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:12.600]   they got character
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:15.600]   reminds me of True Romance
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:17.600]   that scene with Drexel
[01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:20.600]   I'll stand
[01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:36.600]   Jack, sit down
[01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:39.600]   this ain't gonna end well
[01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:57.600]   I'll pass
[01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:06.600]   yeah, you gotta wonder with all that neurotech
[01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:08.600]   what kind of drugs they do
[01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:15.600]   what is with this guy?
[01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:28.600]   watch, this is like a spot
[01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:30.600]   what's the dynamic spot robot?
[01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:32.600]   oh, it's a robot dog in it
[01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:34.600]   this is awesome
[01:05:34.600 --> 01:06:01.600]   where am I supposed to look?
[01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:04.600]   we'll take it
[01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:25.600]   there's a lot of swearing in this game
[01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:27.600]   *reads instructions on screen*
[01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:49.600]   uh oh
[01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:51.600]   this is not gonna end well
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:53.600]   *reads instructions on screen*
[01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:57.600]   ah boy
[01:06:57.600 --> 01:06:59.600]   let's shoot him
[01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:13.600]   gotta grab the robot
[01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:15.600]   almost forgot
[01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:17.600]   got the set, bot and controller
[01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:20.600]   let's go, the quicker the better
[01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:23.600]   alright
[01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:25.600]   looking at the time
[01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:27.600]   I gotta escape this place
[01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:29.600]   I'm sure that would be very much fun
[01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:31.600]   but uh
[01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:33.600]   I gotta get back to work
[01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:35.600]   I got about an hour more
[01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:37.600]   before I head to bed
[01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:39.600]   this was really fun to escape
[01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:41.600]   but mostly it was fun to just play games again
[01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:43.600]   I would say this is kind of like
[01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:45.600]   a Grand Theft Auto with an RPG flavor to it
[01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:47.600]   I think
[01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:49.600]   a lot of people would really enjoy this game
[01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:51.600]   it's not really my thing
[01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:53.600]   I'd love to explore this world
[01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:55.600]   in a different kind of context
[01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:57.600]   this is a little bit too much shooting
[01:07:57.600 --> 01:07:59.600]   for my tastes
[01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:01.600]   if I'm gonna do shooting I'd rather do just a
[01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:03.600]   straight up shoot, like I like
[01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:05.600]   Call of Duty, all that kind of stuff
[01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:07.600]   this was a cool game, but I'm gonna
[01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:09.600]   walk away with a smile
[01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:11.600]   and uh some good memories
[01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:13.600]   sadly I didn't get to meet
[01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:15.600]   Gano Rizzo's character, but uh
[01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:17.600]   life is full of disappointments
[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:19.600]   as David Goggins said recently
[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:21.600]   on his Instagram, when life
[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:23.600]   gives you lemons, just
[01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:25.600]   eat the mother effing lemons
[01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:27.600]   so
[01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:29.600]   I hope there wasn't too much swearing
[01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:31.600]   or nudity in this game, that was kind of
[01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:33.600]   a shock to me a little bit
[01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:35.600]   definitely haven't played a game like it before
[01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:37.600]   maybe like Duke Nukem was the last
[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:39.600]   game that had that kind of
[01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:41.600]   flavor to it
[01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:43.600]   anyway this is uh
[01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:45.600]   a first time I played a video game in quite a long
[01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:47.600]   time and definitely
[01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:49.600]   obviously the first time I've ever recorded
[01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:51.600]   myself playing a video game so
[01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:53.600]   this is just a one giant experiment
[01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:55.600]   let me know what you think, if it's of
[01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:57.600]   interest to anyone I'll play another video game
[01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:59.600]   maybe close to New Year's
[01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:01.600]   and try to do it once a month
[01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:03.600]   but like I said, 2021
[01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:05.600]   is gonna be a hell of a crazy year
[01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:07.600]   this was a lot of fun
[01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:09.600]   if you have time on your hands
[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:11.600]   you should definitely play this game
[01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:13.600]   if not then you should get your butt back
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:15.600]   to work
[01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:17.600]   and again thanks to our two sponsors

[01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:21.600]   like I said, one's for the muscles
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:23.600]   one's for your grammar
[01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:25.600]   pick the one you want to work on most or do both

[01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:33.600]   hope this was at all enjoyable
[01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:35.600]   let me know what other games you'd like to
[01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:37.600]   see me play in the distant future

[01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:41.600]   all of you to play this or
[01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:43.600]   other video games if it's a source of joy
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:45.600]   life's too short
[01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:47.600]   not to do all these kinds of
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:49.600]   fun little detours
[01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:51.600]   love you all, happy holidays
