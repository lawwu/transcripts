[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   "You are probably going to be fired for this letter that you wrote.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.260]   Sam is going to destroy your professional reputation.
[00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:08.760]   Like, where do you think you're going to be able to work after FTX?"
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.640]   He was threatening me.
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.480]   When I knew Sam, when he was 21, 22 years old,
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.900]   he was, like, a happy, healthy-looking kid.
[00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.900]   When I got to FTX,
[00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.660]   I saw someone who was very different than that person I remember.
[00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.000]   And it felt like he was spending virtually no time helping the company move forward.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   It was so much about image and brand and PR.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   Media was primed for the archetype that was Sam.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   It doesn't matter how little time he spent with the company.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   It doesn't matter how he treated employees internally.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   Architect, it makes it really easy to access
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   kind of all corners of the digital asset ecosystem.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   Okay, today I have the pleasure of speaking with Brad Harrison,
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   who is now the founder of Architect,
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   which provides traders with infrastructure for accessing digital markets.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   Before that, he was the president of FTX US.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   And before that, he was the head of ETF technology at Citadel.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   And he has a large amount of experience in leadership positions in finance and tech.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   So this is going to be a very interesting conversation.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Thanks for coming on the Lunar Society, Brett.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   Yeah, thanks for coming out to Chicago.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   Yeah, my pleasure. My pleasure.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Is the growth of ETFs a good thing for the health of markets?
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   There's one view that as there's more passive investing,
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   you're kind of diluting the power of smart money.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   And in fact, what these active investors are doing with their fees
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   is subsidizing the price discovery that makes markets efficient.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   And with passive investing, you're sort of free riding off of that.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   You were head of ETF technology at Citadel.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   So you're the perfect person to ask this.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Is it bad that there's so much passive investing?
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   I think on that it's good.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   I think that most investors in the market shouldn't be trying to pick individual stock names.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   And the best thing people can do is invest in sort of diversified instruments.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   And it is far, far, far less expensive to invest in like indices now
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   than it ever was in history because of the advent of ETFs.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Yeah. So maybe it's good for individual investors to put their money in passives investments.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   But what about like the health of the market as a whole?
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Is it hampered by how much money goes into passive investments?
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   It's hard to be able to tell what it would look like if there was less money in passive investment now.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   I do think one of the potential downsides is ending up creating
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   extra correlated activity between instruments purely by virtue of them being included in index products.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   So, you know, if like when Tesla gets added to the S&P 500,
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   like Tesla doesn't suddenly become a different company whose market value is fundamentally changing.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   But yet it's going to start moving very differently in terms of its beta correlation
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   between other instruments and S&P 500 purely as a function of all the passive investing
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   that moves these instruments in the same direction.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   So that's the sense in which I think it could be detrimental.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   But naively, you would assume that like efficient market hypothesis would say that
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   if people know that Tesla stock price would irrationally climb when it's included in the S&P 500,
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   then people would short it and then there should be no impact from this irrelevant information.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Why isn't that the case?
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   It probably mostly is.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   I think that sometimes there can be liquidity differences that cause
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   at least temporary dislocations in stocks.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Like, I mean, the simplest example is like you have an ADR,
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   like an American Depository Receipt, that's sort of expungeable for some underlying foreign stock.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   And these two things should be like almost the same value at all times,
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   like net of currency conversion and conversion ratios.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   But if one of the markets is highly illiquid or difficult to access,
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   then there's going to be dislocations in price.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   And that's like the job of like the James Truce of the world
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   to kind of arbitrage away the price over time.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   And so long run, you wouldn't expect these things to be dislocated for that long.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   So I'm sure there are people who are understanding like the fundamentals
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   of individual names in the S&P 500.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   And when there's like American news and the entire S&P falls,
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   they are, you know, maybe buying S&P and selling individual names
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   and expecting that relative value spread to come in over time.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   Speaking of, by the way, these firms, you don't have to tell me specifics,
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   but how similar are the strategies for market making
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   or trading that James Reed versus Citadel and these firms?
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Is it the same sorts of strategies or are they pretty different?
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   I think a lot more differences than people appreciate from the outside.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Different companies have, they establish different niches and areas
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   like James Reed established its early niche and ETFs
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   at kind of like a mid frequency level.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   So not like ultra fast, but not like long term, year long discretionary macro.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   Whereas maybe your Citadel Securities kind of firm got, you know,
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   built their niche more on like lower latency, you know, options market making.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   So it could be all over the place.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   There are some where they are trying to optimize for really short term,
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   like microstructure alphas, like trying to predict
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   where the order book is going to move
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   over the course of anywhere from milliseconds to seconds.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   There are firms that care more about the relative convergence
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   of instruments over the course of hours to days.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   There's, you know, sophisticated quantitative trading firms
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   that are doing longer term, you know, days to weeks to months, long trades too.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   A lot of the infrastructure can be similar,
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   like either way you need to be able to connect to exchanges,
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   download market data, establish simulation platforms,
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   build like tools for traders to be able to grasp what's going on in the market
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   and especially be able to visualize like their own proprietary models and alphas.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   But beyond that, the actual strategies
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   and the ways they make money can be very different.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   Famously in other kinds of development,
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   there's these like very famous hacks and algorithms, right?
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   So in gaming and graphics,
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   John Carmack has the famous fast inverse square root
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   for doing graphics calculations, normalizing vectors faster.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   You were not only a developer in finance,
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   I know what the exact term is for that,
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   but you led, you know, teams of hundreds of people
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   who are doing that kind of development.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   Are there famous examples like this in finance,
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   the equivalent of fast inverse square root,
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   but for the kinds of calculations you guys do?
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   Yeah, they're like all over the place.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   There's tons of, you know, hacks and tricks and things like that.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   I think, for example, here's a famous one,
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   not famous, I think I read it in a paper
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   and like a bunch of other developers
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   from different other companies told me about this.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   It's not something I saw at places that I worked,
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   but if you're sending a message to, let's say, NASDAQ to buy stock
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   and you want to get there as fast as possible,
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   well, what is a message to NASDAQ?
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   It's a, you know, TCP/IP wrapped message
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   with a particular proprietary protocol that NASDAQ implements.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   Well, let's say your goal is, you know,
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   you know you're going to trade Apple,
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   but you're not sure like what price and at what time,
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   and you're kind of waiting for some signal to buy Apple
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   as fast as possible.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   So what you can do is you can pre-construct
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   the entire TCP/IP message,
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   like first put the TCP header on there,
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   then the IP header, then like the kind of outer protocol
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   that NASDAQ specifies, and the inner protocol,
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   except for like the byte slot where you put in the price,
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   and then pre-load that message
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   into the network card's sending buffer
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   so that once you're ready to send,
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   you can just like pop in the price and send it off
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   and incur as little latency as possible.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   That's awesome.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   I think the analogy to video games is a good one
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   because like just like in, you know, video game graphics,
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   what's the end goal?
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   It's not like to produce the most theoretically perfect simulation
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   of environmental graphics.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   It's to have something that like looks good enough
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   and is fast enough for the user.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   And that's also true in like HFT and quantitative finance
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   where like the goal is to get to like the approximately right trade
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   as fast as you can.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   It's not to have like the perfect theoretical model of,
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   you know, underlying price dynamics.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   That is so fascinating.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   But this actually raises an interesting question.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   If you have some sort of algorithm like this
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   that gets you a few nanoseconds faster to the Nasdaq exchange,
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   and that's why you have Edge,
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   or you've like leased microwave towers
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   to get from New Jersey to Chicago faster,
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   or you've bought an expensive server in the same place
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   that like Nasdaq is housed,
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   what fundamentally is the advantage to society as a whole
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   from us getting that sort of information faster?
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   Is this just sort of a zero-sum game
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   of who can incorporate that signal faster?
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   Like why is it good for society
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   that so many resources and so much brainpower
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   is spent on these kinds of hacks and these kinds of optimizations?
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   Yeah, so I think if you start from the premise
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   that having liquid, tight, efficient markets
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   is important for the world,
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   and you say like, "How do I design a system
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   that optimizes for that?"
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   I think you want smart, sophisticated technologists
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   competing at the margins.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   And of course, the more they compete,
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   the smaller the margins become
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   to the point where you think like
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   the little extra activity people are doing
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   to get slightly better
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   don't seem to be greatly affecting the whole system
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   as much as it was in the earlier days
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   when things were slower and tick sizes were wider.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   I think it's difficult to imagine designing a market
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   where you say like, "Okay, everyone should innovate
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   up until this point and then stop competing
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   and then just stay stasis."
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   And maybe you can create certain regulatory
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   or market structures to try to prevent that,
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   but I think on average you want people
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   competing at the margins,
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   even if they seem like they are minuscule.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   But at the same time,
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   I think it's not zero-sum for society,
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   for technologists to be creating super-fast,
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   ultra-low-latency, very sophisticated algorithms.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   Maybe, I don't know,
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   we have a lot of geopolitical instability in the world.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   Who knows if like our microwave network
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   that we built out in the U.S.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   could have like greater use cases
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   than just for quantitative finance,
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   but quantitative finance subsidized
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   the creation of these towers.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   - Okay.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   So that's sort of like a contingent potential benefit.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   I guess people will tell us
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   a story about NASA, right?
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   In this case, literally microwaves
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   that they subsidized a lot of the science
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   that ended up becoming into products.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   So that's an interesting account
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   of the benefits of finance,
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   that it has the same, yeah,
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   whatever tricks they come up with
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   might be useful elsewhere.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   But that's not a story about
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   how it's directly useful to have,
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   you know, nanosecond-level latency
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   for filing your like Apple stock
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   or something like that.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   Why is that useful?
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   Directly, I mean.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   - If there is some kind of news
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   that happens in one part of the world,
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   and that should affect the current price of stock
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   in a different part of the world.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   I think that if you care about efficient markets,
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   you want the gap between like source of truth events
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   and ultimate price discovery
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   to be as small as possible.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   I think if you believe,
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   if you want to question
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   whether getting, you know,
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   a few extra like milliseconds
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   or microseconds or nanoseconds is worth it,
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   I think you're then putting
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   some kind of like value judgments
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   on like what is the optimal time
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   it takes to get to price discovery
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   and saying like, you know,
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   a second is too slow,
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   but a millisecond is too fast,
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   or a millisecond is too slow,
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   but a microsecond is too fast.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   And I just don't think
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   we're like in a position to do that.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   I think we kind of always want
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   as close to instantaneous price discovery as possible.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   - I'm only asking more about this
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   because this is really interesting to me.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   There are some little resources
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   where we would say that
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   at this point it's not worth it, right?
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   Like let's say $5 trillion a year
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   was spent on getting it down
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   from like two nanoseconds
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   to like one nanosecond.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   I know that that's probably
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   not a realistic number,
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   but just like there's some margin
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   at which for some weird reason
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   the incentives of society
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   are to spend so many resources on it.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   Or would you say
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   that we haven't reached that margin yet
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   where it's not socially useful,
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   the amount of brain power
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   and resources that are spent
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   on getting these tight spreads
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   - I don't know how large a percentage
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   of like GDP prop trading is.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   I suspect it's not that large.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   So I don't think we're close
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   to that theoretical limit
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   of where I would start to feel
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   that it's a waste.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   But I also think like there's a reason
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   why they're willing to spend the money
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   on this kind of technology
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   because they're obviously profiting
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   from doing so
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   and it has to come from somewhere.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   So somehow like the market
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   is subsidizing the creation
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   of this technology,
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   which means that there's still
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   ability for value capture,
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   which means there's still a service
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   that's being provided in exchange
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   for some kind of profit.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   I think we wouldn't spend
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   five trillion dollars
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   on a microwave network
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   because there isn't five trillion dollars
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   of extra value
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   to be created in doing so.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   - Got it.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   Has being a market maker
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   changed your views
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   about civilizational tail risk
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   because you're worried
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   and like you're worried
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   about personally getting run over, right,
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   by some sort of weird event
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   and adverse selection.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   Does that change how we think
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   about societies getting run over
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   by a similar thing
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   or are the mental models isolated?
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   - So I think working in high speed finance
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   teaches you to understand
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   how to more correctly estimate
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   the probability of rare events.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   And in that sense,
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   working in finance makes me think
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   more about the likelihood
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   of civilization ending problems.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   But it doesn't suggest to me
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   sort of different solutions.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   There's a very big difference
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   being in a financial setting
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   where your positions are numbers
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   that you can put in a spreadsheet
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   and you can model what happens
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   if every single position goes against me,
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   3X the wrong way,
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   and what instruments
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   would I have to buy or sell
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   in order to be able to hedge that portfolio.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   That's like a closed system
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   that you can actually model
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   and do something about.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   Having like a trader mentality
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   on future pandemics
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   I don't think helps you much.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   I think maybe it slightly changes
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   your ability to kind of estimate
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   the probability of such events.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   But the actual solutions
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   to these problems
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   are a combination of like
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   collective action problems
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   plus being able to sort of model
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   the particular type of unknown, unknown
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   about whatever the event is.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   And I think those kinds of solutions
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   should be left to the experts
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   in those particular fields
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   and not up to traders.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   In other words, I don't think
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   having the trader mentality
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   around rare events
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   in like normal civilization
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   outside of finance
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   really kind of helps you much.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   And maybe in some ways
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   it's led people to think
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   more hubristically
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   that they can do something about it.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   - Gee, who could we be talking about?
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   (laughs)
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   That's really interesting
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   you would say that.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   I would have, famously,
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   these market-making firms
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   really care about having
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   their employees be well calibrated
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   and good at sort of thinking about risk.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   I'm surprised you think
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   that the transfer between
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   thinking about that
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   in the financial context
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   and thinking about that
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   in other contexts is that low.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   - Yeah, again, I think it helps you
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   at estimating probability of rare events.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   But it does not translate super well
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   to what action then do you take
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   in the face of knowing those rare events.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   - Were your circles of people in finance
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   earlier to recognize the dangers of COVID?
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   - That's a good question.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   I think that people in my circles
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   were quicker to take action
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   in the face of knowing about COVID.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   There are a lot of people
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   who kind of stuck around
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   in cities and their existing
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   particular situations
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   not knowing kind of
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   where this was going to head long-term.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   And I think if you have the fortune
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   of having the financial flexibility
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   to be able to do something like this,
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   a lot of the people
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   in kind of financial circles
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   kind of immediately recognize,
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   okay, there's this big risk,
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   this unknown,
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   and I don't want to get
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   adverse selected against
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   in terms of being able to
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   get out of the locus
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   of bad pandemic activity.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   And so people immediately
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   were fleeing cities,
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   I think, faster than other people.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   - That seems to point in the opposite direction
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   of them not being able to
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   estimate and deal with geopolitical risk.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   - Well, I mean, there you have
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   like an actual event that has occurred
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   and then in the face of the event,
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   what do you do right now?
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   I think that's different than like,
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   what do we do about the potential
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   for AI to destroy civilization
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   in the next hundreds of years?
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   Or what do we do about the next
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   potential biological weapon
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   or the next pandemic that could occur?
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   - Yeah.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   Speaking of COVID,
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   you were head of semi-systemic technology
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   at Citadel when COVID hit, right?
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   - Yes, exactly.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   - How did these HFT firms react to COVID?
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   What was it like during COVID?
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   Because obviously the market moved a lot,
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   but on the inside, was it good, bad, or?
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   - Yeah, I mean, all the companies,
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   I mean, Citadel Securities,
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   but really all of the ones
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   in this finance sphere,
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   I think were extremely resilient.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   I think a lot of them found that
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   their preexisting ideas that
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   in order for the team to succeed,
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   everyone needed to be in the exact same place.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   And it was very important from like a IP perspective
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   to make sure that people
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   weren't taking a lot of this work home with them
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   completely went out the window
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   and people had to completely adjust to the idea
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   that actual trading teams
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   that are used to being able to have
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   like eye contact with each other at all times
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   need to adjust to this pandemic world.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   And they largely did.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   I think at least from a profitability perspective,
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   it was some of the best years of HFT firms,
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   P&Ls in recent history.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   - Matching engines already have to deal with the fact that
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   you can have orders come in from like Illinois,
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   you can have orders coming from Japan
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   and given light speed,
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   they're not gonna arrive at the same time.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   You still kind of have to work around that.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   Is there any hope of a single market
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   and matching engine for once humanity goes interplanetary
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   or interstellar, could we ever have a market
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   between like us and Alpha Centauri or even us and Mars?
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   Or is the lag too much for that to be possible?
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   - Yeah, so I mean,
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   without making any changes to a matching engine,
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   there is nothing that says that when an order comes in,
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   it can't be older than X time, right?
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   What it does mean is that like the actual sender,
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   if like they're sending a market order
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   from halfway across the world,
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   by the time that the order reaches the exchange,
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   they might end up with a very different price
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   than the one that they were expecting when they sent it.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   And therefore,
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   like there's probably a lot of adverse selection
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   sending a market order from halfway across the world
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   than in a co-location facility.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   So you can technologically run an interstellar exchange.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   It just might not be good
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   for that person living on the moon.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   - Is there any way to make it more fair?
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   - Yeah, so I think there's actually
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   a kind of real world analog of that,
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   which is like automated market makers on slow blockchains.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   Because if you're used to working on NASDAQ
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   where NASDAQ processes like a single message
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   in somewhere between like tens
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   and hundreds of nanoseconds per order,
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   a blockchain like Ethereum processes what?
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   Like 15 to 50 messages per second.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   So significantly slower
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   by like numbers of orders of magnitude.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   And yet they've been able to establish
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   like pretty mature like financial marketplaces
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   by saying that rather than you having to like send orders
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   with prices on them and then cancel them
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   when the prices aren't good anymore,
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   like there will be kind of an automated function
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   that moves the prices at the matching engine.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   And so whenever your order reaches the exchange,
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   it'll always be kind of a predetermined fair price
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   based on the kind of prevailing liquidity at the time.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   So one can imagine like building a NASDAQ
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   for like interstellar market is kind of similar
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   to building like Uniswap now on Ethereum
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   in terms of order magnitude and speed.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   But there's other things you can do too.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   Like you could establish like periodic auctions
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   instead of like continuous matching and things like that.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   And that could potentially help mitigate some of these issues.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   - Yeah, it's actually something else I wanna ask you about.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   What is your opinion of periodic,
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   you know, frequent batch auction systems?
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   Should we have more of that instead of?
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   - So in theory, they help mitigate the advantages
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   of high-frequency trading
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   because if you know there's going to be an auction
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   every 30 seconds
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   and it's not going to be by time priority,
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   it's gonna be by price,
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   then it doesn't matter if you send that order
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   at the beginning of the 30-second period
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   or the end of the 30-second period.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   Like it's really like the price
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   that determines whether you're getting filled,
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   not something to do with like particular latency
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   to the exchange.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   I think in practice,
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   the couple of exchanges around the world
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   that used to have those have switched away from them.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   Like I think the like Taiwan Stock Exchange
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   used to have periodic auction system
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   and they just thought the,
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   like the liquidity and price discovery wasn't good
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   and it was like complained about a lot
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   and they eventually moved off of it
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   to a continuous matching system.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   So I guess in practice, it doesn't quite work as well.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   But it's hard to tell.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   It's really hard to tell.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   - What country, I mean, in your long experience
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   of developing financial infrastructure,
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   what country do you feel has the best infrastructure
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   and set up for good markets?
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   - I would say the United States,
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   except what's happened is U.S. companies like NASDAQ
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   have licensed their exchange matching engine technology
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   to other exchanges around the world.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   So like the NASDAQ OMX technology
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   powers a number of the exchanges in Europe
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   and some in Asia.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   So it's hard to sort of say that like,
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   is the technology American?
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   Like I guess so.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   I'm not sure exactly who wrote a lot of the stuff
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   underneath the NASDAQ technology,
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   but I do think the U.S. markets
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   are some of the most efficient and low latency
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   and expansive and products set allowed in the world.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   - How do adverse selection in trading and hiring differ?
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   - In hiring, there are one,
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   many more opportunities for positive selection
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   versus the negative selection
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   you usually encounter in finance.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   And the other thing is that
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   most financial markets are like, you know,
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   in the U.S. when you think about like trading in general,
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   you're thinking about like liquid markets.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   The hiring market is highly inefficient.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   You know, maybe the like pipeline of, you know,
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   orders from like Harvard, MIT, Princeton, Yale
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   to Jane Street and Citadel Securities
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   is like a very liquid pipeline.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   But like there are many, many universities
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   and colleges throughout the country and the world
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   that have extremely talented individuals
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   whose resumes will like never end up on your doorstep.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   So you might end up with like a resume
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   from, you know, some graduating senior from college
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   who has no internship experience
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   and your trader mindset might think,
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   okay, this is terrible adverse selection.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   But it actually could be that like that person,
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   if he's willing to put themselves out there
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   and apply to your company
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   from this like relatively unknown university,
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   then that might be the signal
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   that that is like the best person in that entire region.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   And that might be a positive selection.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   So I think that it's not exactly the same
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   like adverse selection dynamics as there is
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   in the traditional trading world.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   - Yeah, yeah, definitely.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   Especially if you have like,
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   I guess mission oriented companies
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   have a especially good way of getting rid
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   of adverse selection, right?
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   - Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   Like the companies with really strong brands.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   I mean, that's one of the things we saw at Jane Street
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   was like, I heard stories in the old days of Jane Street
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   that like the first resumes from Harvard
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   were like the people were terrible.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   Like they couldn't do like basic math
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   and they just wrote this like the worst candidates
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   compared to other people that they were able to find.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   And then they established this brand
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   and this recruiting pipeline
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   and this reputation for having very difficult interviews
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   and for paying people really well
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   and having this like amazing work environments
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   that all of a sudden,
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   all the people getting through the pipeline from Harvard
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   were like really, really great.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   And it wasn't like the quality of students
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   at Harvard changed.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   There's probably a bell curve there
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   like there is everywhere else.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   It was just like the positive selection resulting
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   from the branding efforts
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   and the like mission driven,
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   like focus of the company
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   that really brought that positive selected pipeline
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   to them.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   - Yeah, that's really interesting.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   Should Jane Street replace OCaml with Rust?
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   - No, because there's too much infrastructure
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   already in OCaml.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   - Yeah, but starting from scratch.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   - So I guess the world is
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   if they could like snap their fingers
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   and suddenly replace all their OCaml infrastructure
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   with Rust at like zero costs,
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   like would it be worth it?
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   - Yeah.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   - In that case, I would say yes.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   Because I think that you get a lot of the
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   sort of static typing and compile time safety
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   in Rust that you get from OCaml,
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   but the base level program that you can write
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   in Rust is much, much faster
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   than one you can write in OCaml.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   Because of the way OCaml is designed,
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   where there's this kind of automatic garbage collection,
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   the worst thing you can do in a high-speed finance
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   is do any memory allocation that results
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   in garbage collection.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   And so you have to write very, very careful OCaml.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   It almost ends up looking like C
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   in order to end up, you know,
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   staying in functional programming land,
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   but not actually creating tons of memory
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   on the heap or the stack
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   that ends up getting collected later.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   - I guess you've been playing around
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   with Rust a lot recently, right?
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   - Yeah.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   - What is your impression of the language?
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   Have you been enjoying it?
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   - It's great.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   And it's come a very long way
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   in the last three to five years.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   I think crypto has something to do with that.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   It seems to be like one of the
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   like languages of choice for people to write
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   like blockchains and smart contracts.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   And so there's been an enormous amount
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   of like open-source contribution to Rust.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   And so compared to when I had like last looked
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   at it a couple of years ago,
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   it's a lot easier to write like really good,
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   sophisticated programs now in Rust
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   and get all of like the type safety
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   and the speed that you get,
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   which is like very comparable
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   to C++ on the speed side.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   - Well, when I'm writing programs,
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   they're not large code bases
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   with many people contributing.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   So when I use Rust,
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   it's just like a huge pay.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   And like, why is,
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   I just want to do something very simple.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   Why did I put like an arc
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   instead of a box instead of an option?
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   But I can totally understand if you have something
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   where like billions of dollars are at stake.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   - There's definitely a learning curve.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   And I think for basic scripting,
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   you want to use something like Python.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   - Right.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   - But exactly.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   If you're writing like low latency distributed
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   infrastructure that has to never fail,
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   Rust is a pretty good choice.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   - Yeah.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   Speaking of Jane Street,
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   why does a company pay interns
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   like 16 or 17K a month
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   for their summer internships?
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   Is the opportunity cost
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   for one of these smart students that high
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   in the summer?
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   - The short answer is yes.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   But the long answer to why I think they do that
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   is, you know,
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   the starting salary
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   for the top people
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   in not just finance,
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   but in tech
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   is sort of in this like low to mid six figures now.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   And you can like debate
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   whether you think that's like the appropriate
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   starting salary for a person with like no experience
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   coming out of college or not.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   But just sort of the reality
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   is that the talents pool
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   is extremely competitive
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   from the employer side.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   So if you start with that as like a reasonable,
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   you know, salary plus bonus for an employee,
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   I think Jane Street's mentality is
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   these interns who are coming here,
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   like they're doing real work.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   They should be paid like a full-time employee
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   just like paraded for the time
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   when they're actually here.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   And so that like ends up like checking out
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   to be like the right numbers.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   Wait, on net, our interns,
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   I mean, forget about the salary.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   Like, are they actually on net contributing
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   given that subtracting away
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   the time of the traders who are training them?
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   Maybe it sort of breaks even
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   if you consider like the time to train them.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   But it's extremely worthwhile
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   because when those interns come back full-time
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   and Jane Street hires a significant percentage
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   of its incoming classes
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   from their internship program,
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   that they're already trained.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   They're ready to go day one.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   They're almost immediately useful
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   because they had that like three-month period
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   where they got trained
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   and only the ones that really liked it
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   and were good come back.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   So it's like rather than wait
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   for them to come on site,
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   train people and maybe half of them aren't good
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   or half of them don't fit with the culture
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   and you kind of don't know what to do with them,
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   the internship program provides
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   like a really good place
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   to get like on-the-job training
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   and then only kind of select on both sides
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   for the ones that are the best.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   - Is there a free rider problem with internships
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   where if like a company like Jane Street
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   puts in the effort to train somebody for three months,
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   they might get some of them to work for them,
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   but they've also trained some people
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   who might work for the competition.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   And like, is there some sort of free rider problem there?
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   - There for sure is,
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   which is why the companies have to work
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   as hard as possible
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   to make their experience as good as possible,
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   which is like, it's good for the interns.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   You know, like when you go to Jane Street,
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   like not only do you like learn a lot,
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   but like they pay you really well
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   and also like you get to, you know,
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   visit one of the foreign offices
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   for like a week or something.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   Also like they have all these like really fun programs
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   where they bring like famous speakers
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   to come to the office
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   and speak to the whole, you know, intern class
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   and they have, you know, like parties
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   and all sorts of stuff.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   And it adds to like the experience of thinking like,
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   okay, this is the place I want to work.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   I don't want to like take my training
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   and go to the competitor.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   I want to come to you.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   - Yeah, I clearly got in the wrong business with podcasts.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   (laughing)
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   Why did you pursue finance dev instead of trading?
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   Why did that appeal more to you?
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   - Yeah, so in college I studied computer science and math
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   and I really liked programming,
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   but I think I didn't quite know
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   what a career in programming looked like.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   I think the conventional wisdom,
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   at least like in 2009 when I was applying for internships,
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   was like, okay, I'm going to sit in the cubicle
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   and like stare at a screen for 16 hours a day.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   I'm going to be miserable.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   And it's not going to be a very social job.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   I consider myself like a pretty social person.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   And I had a lot of friends
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   who had had these like various internships
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   in quantitative finance, like mostly from the trading side.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   And so when eventually I went to Jane Street as an intern,
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   I had kind of like a hybrid summer
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   of like doing some dev stuff and some trading stuff.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   And to me, I thought like, okay,
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   the traders are much closer to like the real action
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   of the company and like, I want to be a part of that.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   And so when I joined Jane Street,
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   I was hired as a trader on the ADR desk.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   And I realized like very soon into that,
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   that one, no, like actually the developers
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   have like just as much, if not more,
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   impact on the outcome of the success of the company.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   And two, I just like enjoyed it a lot more
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   and it was just much more up my alley in my training.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   And so I ended up going that route instead.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   - I want to ask about the culture
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   at these sorts of places like Citadel or Jane Street.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   I mean, you spend some time in Silicon Valley
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   and around like traditional sort of like startup scene as well.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   What is the main difference
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   between Silicon Valley tech culture
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   versus, you know, quant New York culture?
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   - Sure. - Or I guess Chicago culture.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   - Yeah, so I have a ton of personal experience
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   like in the Silicon Valley culture
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   or like the tech culture since I've only really worked
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   at kind of finance places my whole life.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   But the sense I get is that the kind of New York, Chicago,
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   quant finance dev culture is one about extreme pragmatism.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   Like, you know what the outcome is.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   It's like, you know, be the most profitable at the strategy
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   and you kind of try to draw a straight line
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   between what you're doing
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   and that profitability as fast as you can.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   Compared to, I think the Silicon Valley culture
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   is much more about like creativity
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   and doing things that are like new
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   that no one else has done before.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   A healthy amounts of cross pollination
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   would be good for both.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   Where I think a lot of trading firms
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   are doing like the exact same things
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   that all the other trading firms are done
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   and some like healthy, you know,
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   injection of creativity into some of that stuff
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   to maybe think slightly outside the box of like,
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   you know, as you said earlier,
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   like get slightly faster to go to NASDAQ or something,
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   which is like, okay, it's probably be fine,
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   but it's not that creative
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   would be good for those quant firms.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   At the same time, they're like sheer approach
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   to pragmatically getting something done
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   and out there and sold and making money
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   would help a lot of Silicon Valley firms
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   that kind of like hang out
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   in this sort of creative land for too long
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   and don't end up getting a product to market.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   - Yeah, I know.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   I definitely, it seems like there should be one founder
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   from both those cultures, every single startup.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   It's similar to what you were saying earlier
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   with like SPF and like visionaries
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   versus pragmatist in that context.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   How conspicuous, I mean,
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   you were just mentioning earlier
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   that these traders are making mid six figure salaries
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   to begin with,
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   let alone where they arise over their careers.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   How conspicuous is their spending and lifestyle?
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   Is it close to Wolf of Wall Street?
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   Is it just a Walmart t-shirts?
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   Like where are we talking?
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   - It's probably a lot closer to Walmart t-shirts
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   than it is Wolf of Wall Street.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   I mean, certainly it is now,
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   even when I started, it was pretty inconspicuous.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   I don't think it was that way
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   in like the previous decade or two
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   before I joined finance.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   I guess I'm not really sure,
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   but I got the sense that the current culture
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   around inconspicuous consumption
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   is sort of a function of millennial consumption habits
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   where people are focusing a lot more
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   on like experiences
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   than having shiny material objects.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   I think that's had a large effect
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   on kind of like the high earning tech
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   and finance culture that exists today.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   - Well, I guess,
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   are they spending that much money on experiences either?
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   'Cause how expensive is a flight to Hawaii, right?
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   And even after you subtract that,
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   like where's this money going?
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   Are they just saving it?
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   - Maybe it's not like just a flight to Hawaii,
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   but it's like bring your 10 friends
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   to Hawaii with you or something.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   Or it's, you know,
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   get involved in like a charitable organization
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   in a way that like someone who is 24
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   like normally wouldn't be able to do
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   purely by being able to like donate a lot.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   - Yeah.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   What is the social consequence,
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   for lack of a better word,
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   of having a bunch of young nerdy people,
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   often male, often single,
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   having this extraordinary level of wealth?
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   Like what impact does it have?
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   I don't know if a society is the right word,
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   but like what is the broader impact
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   of that class of people?
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   - I think we'll have to play this out
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   over the next decade or two
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   to really see where this goes.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   If I'm gonna be an optimist about this,
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   I'd like to think that
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   when it was like older, you know,
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   single or married males, you know,
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   hoarding a large amount of wealth
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   that for the most part,
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   they kept it to themselves
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   and kind of waited until later in life
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   to do anything with it.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   And we're the kind of people
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   who really like save their same career
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   their whole lives,
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   as opposed to if younger and younger generations
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   are amassing wealth through, you know,
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   what they can actually perform with their skills.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   Then I think that hopefully injects more dynamism
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   into the distribution of that wealth later on,
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   because those millennials will then like,
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   or Gen Z or whoever,
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   will go on to like found new companies
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   and maybe they'll be able to seed the company themselves
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   with their own money
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   and have a lot easier time like bringing
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   like interesting new things to market,
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   or they'll be able to donate
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   to like really interesting causes,
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   or they'll be able to, you know,
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   help out their friends and family
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   more easily from a young age,
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   or they'll be more selective
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   in the kinds of things that they, you know,
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   give to or contribute to
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   that don't just involve like getting their name
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   on like a building of a school or something.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   - Yeah, yeah, that's a very optimistic story.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   I hope that's the way it plays out.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   So tell me about the psychology
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   of being a quant or a trader
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   or a developer in that space,
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   because you're responsible,
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   like one wrong keystroke
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   and you've lost millions of dollars,
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   you know, one bug in your code,
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   and there are, you know,
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   historical cases of this,
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   like where entire firms go down because of a bug.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   Like what is the sort of like
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   day-to-day psychological impact
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   of that kind of responsibility?
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   - Maybe the job selects for the people
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   who don't kind of crumble under the like,
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   you know, theoretical stress of that job.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   But personally, like I don't lose sleep overnight,
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   night over that,
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   because within any like mature financial institution,
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   like a trading firm,
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   there are typically like many layers
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   of safeguards in place,
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   like, you know,
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   limits on like how many dollars
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   you can trade in a minute
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   and how much you can trade overall
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   or for your desk
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   or like how many messages
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   you can send to the exchange.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   And then there's like limits on like
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   the individual trader
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   and desk level and firm level.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   And there's like layers of different checks.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   Often there are actual rules,
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   like regulatory rules,
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   to comply with the market access checks,
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   like, you know, FINRA is like 15C35.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   And so when you're writing new code,
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   it's not like a completely
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   like blank slate thing
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   where you're connecting directly to an exchange
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   and like hoping for the best.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   Usually you're embedding some piece of code
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   within some very large established framework
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   where the goal is to make something trader proof.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   No matter what some trader clicks on
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   or does or configures with their system,
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   there's like a limit to how
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   how badly they can actually go.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   And so, especially in my particular role
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   as a developer,
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   like actually being able to understand
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   the technological stack
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   and say like, oh, I can tell
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   and can sort of, you know,
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   verify that like these particular safeguards
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   in place and it is like actually
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   as trader proof as I think it is.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   Like I sort of, I can sleep at night
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   knowing like nothing too bad is going to happen.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   I mean, the times I actually lose sleep
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   are like, you know, a trader in like London
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   or Hong Kong calls me like in the middle of the night
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   to say like, hey, can you explain
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   how this thing works?
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   I need your help.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   Like those are the times
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   where like I actually lose sleep,
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   but it's not over like being concerned about risk.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   - Yeah, that's interesting.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   If you asked the people who work in these firms,
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   what is the social value you're creating
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   separate from the question
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   of what the correct answer to that question is?
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   What would the majority of them say
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   that like I'm doing something really valuable?
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   Would they say like,
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   it's like I'm indifferent to it,
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   but it's earning me a lot of money.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   Like what is their understanding
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   of the value they're creating?
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   - It really depends on the company
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   and it depends how diffuse the culture is.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   At like older firms that have like,
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   you know, sort of fewer people impacting the culture
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   on any significant way,
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   I think you might not get a clear answer on this.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   I think for a place like Jane Street,
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   where, you know, the firm is really run
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   by like 30 or so, you know, partners
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   and senior employees who have like been there
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   for a really long time
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   and have carried through the core culture
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   of that company up till the present day.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   And with that like large number of people
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   at the top in a very flat environment
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   have actually been able to like propagate
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   that culture and maintain it throughout the company.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   I think you'll find a much more kind
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   of homogeneous view on their social value,
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   which I think they would say is that they provide
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   like the best like pricing and access to markets
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   that are critical for facilitating
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   like capital allocation throughout the world
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   and allow people to very efficiently invest
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   in vehicles that are global in nature.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   That seems very abstract.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   And while it is probably very well correct
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   and is very valuable for society,
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   it might not seem that like tangible
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   to somebody who's working in that space.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   Is there some technique that these firms have
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   of making visceral the impact these traders have?
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   I don't know.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   Do they bring out some like child
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   who benefited from efficient markets or something?
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   - I think, well, probably not like children.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   I think it's more like anecdotes
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   about like the pension like fund
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   behind this like state government
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   like needed to get exposure to, you know
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   some diversified asset class
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   and came to one of these companies and said
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   like, we want to move like a $5 billion portfolio.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   Can you help us do it in an efficient way?
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   And it ends up saving them like significant numbers
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   of like percents or basis points
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   over what would happen if like they went to the market.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   And you can say, well
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   like there's like a direct connection
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   between like the price that someone
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   like Jane Street gives them and the amounts
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   of money that they ultimately get to save
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   and ultimately pass on to the people
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   in their state who are part of their pension plan.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   And so like, there's like a direct connection there.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   - Okay, let's start by addressing the elephant
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   in the room, which is FTX.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   Let's begin at Jane Street, which is where you met SBF.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   Can you tell us sort of the origin story
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   of how you first met him and what your first impressions were?
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   So I was at Jane Street from 2010 to 2018.
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   Sam was at Jane Street for a couple of years
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   in the middle of that, I think 2013 and 2017.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   And one of the things I did
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   at Jane Street was I started this program
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   called OCaml Bootcamp.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   It was a yearly course for the new trader hires
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   to spend four weeks with me learning programming
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   in OCaml, which was like the esoteric programming language
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   that we use at Jane Street,
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   along with a lot of our other proprietary systems.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   And Sam was in one of the first cohorts of students.
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   And so I got to meet him through that experience.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   - Got it, okay.
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   And what was your impression of him?
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   - Yeah, he was a smart kid.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   He was nice.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   He kind of got along well with other people in his class.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   You know, he was definitely, you know, above average,
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   but not like, you know, completely stand out at the top.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   Although then again, the bar was extremely high
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   at Jane Street.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   So I think that's already sort of a compliment,
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   but yeah, but, you know, people liked him a lot
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   and thought he had a lot of promise, but you know,
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   he was a young guy like everyone else.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   - Got it.
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   And did that perception change over time
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   while you were at Jane Street?
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   - It slowly started to, you know, Sam was on one
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   of the largest trading desks at Jane Street
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   and, you know, had 50 or 60 people on it.
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   He had several managers.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   And one of my roles at Jane Street was to work
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   with all of the different trading desks
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   on the designs of their particular strategies and systems.
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   And so I would frequently go over to his desk
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   and talk with his managers about stuff.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   And I started pulling him into conversations more
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   and more specifically to talk about some
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   of the like lower latency ETFR stuff we were doing,
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   some of the original like OTC automation things
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   we were working on.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   And so he started actually contributing more
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   to the actual like design and thought behind some
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   of these systems and thought he was, you know, precocious
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   and had a lot of really good intuitions about markets.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   - Got it.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   Okay.
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   And so what exactly was your role at Jane Street
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   at this time and what was his?
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   - Yeah.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   So at this time I was sort of leading the group
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   of software developers, building the technology
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   that was closest to actual trading.
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   You can think in a HFT or any kind of sort
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   of trading firm, there's lots of different developers,
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   people who work on, you know, stuff really relating
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   specifically to the trading technology,
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   people who work on kind of the core systems, networking,
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   kind of internal automation tools, tools for developers.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   So we were in the part of the spectrum that was closest
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   to actual trading.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   And so my job was to like go over
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   to the different trading desks within the company,
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   talk to them about their specific strategy
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   for the products they traded, understand how to,
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   like their priorities about what venues they want
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   to connect to, what different systems they want to create,
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   what different parameter changes they need
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   in their like automated trading systems,
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   what kind of research tools would help them
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   do their job better, what user interface
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   would make it easier for them to understand
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   what's going on in the market and kind of all of that.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   - Okay.
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   And did SVF at this point have any sort of reputation
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   of either being uncooperative or being cooperative
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   or anything ethical or professional
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   that's not worthy at this time?
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   - I don't think there was much that stood out.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   Although, you know, he was again, you know,
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   pretty either precocious at that particular time period.
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   One anecdote that sort of drew me closer to him
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   was Jane Street's offices were in 250 Vesey.
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   They still are in New York City.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   And there's a big food cart on like the second floor.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   And so I once went down to meet with a development person
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   from a nonprofit that works in animal welfare
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   and something that my wife and I had donated
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   to for a long time.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   And I met with this guy and he said, you know,
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   you're the second person I met from Jane Street today,
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   which was wild because Jane Street was like
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   only a couple of hundred people there.
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   It was just like a pretty niche, you know, organization.
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   And I was like, that's crazy.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   You know, who did you meet?
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   And they said, oh, you know, Sam Bankman Freed.
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   And I was like, you know, Sam,
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   I just came down from talking with him upstairs.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   And so I went back and we sort of realized
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   we had this kind of shared interest
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   in helping kind of animal welfare causes.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   We were both, you know, vegans
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   and we sort of bonded over that.
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   That's how we kind of became friendly.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   - Got it.
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   And so it seems that his interest
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   in effective altruism was genuine at this point
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   and early on, there was a history of this.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   - Yeah, you know, it wasn't like EA
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   was super popular at Jane Street.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   I feel like that's a bit of like recent sampling bias.
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   Among this younger crew of Jane Streeters,
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   I think it was because of a lot of association
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   prior to joining Jane Street
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   that they sort of were into effective altruism.
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   But there were a couple of people there
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   who really were fairly vocal about the fact
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   that they were, you know, donating the majority
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   of their yearly salary and bonus to charitable causes
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   and Sam was one of them.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   And yeah, I started to become known for that.
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   - Got it. Okay.
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   So I guess fast forward to he's no longer at Jane Street,
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   you're no longer at Jane Street,
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   and you're at Citadel.
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   He started FTX.
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   Actually, before we go there,
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   were you in contact with him up until the point
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   where you had started talking about a potential?
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   - Yeah, off and on.
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   You know, when I first left Jane Street
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   and he left, sorry,
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   when we both left Jane Street around the same time,
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   him before me, you know,
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   he had told everyone at Jane Street
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   that he was leaving to join
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   the Center for Effective Altruism full time.
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   And I guess he did that.
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   I'm not sure we know if it actually happened
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   because he very soon after started this trading firm
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   and tried to pull lots of Jane Street people
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   to join him to do this trading firm,
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   which didn't make people super happy.
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   But it was funny.
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   We had a phone call and he told me
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   that it wasn't really going super well.
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   He said it was really great in the beginning.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   Like they made a lot of money.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   They had this arbitrage trade.
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   And then a few things kind of went by the wayside.
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   And, you know, they had taken out these huge loans
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   to be able to get their initial capital for Alameda.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   And also there was a big fracture within the company.
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   You know, half the company split, people left.
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   He really didn't tell me much about that at the time.
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   And he said he was probably gonna do something else.
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   And when I asked him, he said,
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:26.000]   I think I'm gonna work on like political prediction markets.
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   And I was like, okay, it doesn't sound super exciting to me.
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   I'm gonna continue on with what I was doing,
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   which was moving to Chicago, taking a new role.
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   But then fast forward, I guess that idea,
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   maybe he wasn't telling me the whole truth at the time,
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   but I guess that idea became FTX
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   and he had supposedly like resuscitated Alameda
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   in the process.
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   That's really interesting.
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   Do you have some sense of what it was that went sideways?
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   - So I pieced together some details over the years
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   because he told me a little bit more after I first joined,
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   I heard a little bit more later from other people
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   and then saw some reporting kind of post FTX collapse.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   I think there were two things.
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   One was the infrastructure they had built,
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   I think was really poor in the beginning.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   A lot of like Python scripts like slapped together.
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   And a couple of times they had sent tokens
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   to the wrong wallet and ended up like losing millions
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   in the process.
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   And they had some big non-arbitrage directional bet
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   on in some token.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   It might've been ETH or something
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   and it went against them.
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   And so they lost a lot of their trading capital.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   And then the other thing was that
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   after some of their technical problems,
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   there was internal disagreements supposedly,
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   this is what Sam told me,
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   about how to move forward with tech.
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   You know, there was half the crew that wanted
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   to kind of rewrite everything from scratch
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.000]   in a different programming language.
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   There was another half that said like,
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   "Okay, we can make some small incremental changes
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   from here and fix things up."
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   And Sam and Gary and Nishad were more in that latter crew.
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   That former crew kind of broke off
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   and started their own thing.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.000]   And that's what originally happened.
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   - Okay, got it.
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   And were you aware of the extent of this at the time?
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   Or is there something pieced together?
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   - No, not at all.
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   I mean, Sam told me a little bit about it,
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:13.000]   but this was over the course of years now
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:16.000]   where I had two different roles.
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.000]   One at Headlands, one at Citadel Securities.
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   Sam was starting Alameda.
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:23.000]   We spoke maybe once a year briefly on the phone.
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   So all this stuff was happening in the background
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   and I had no clue.
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.000]   In fact, the first time I even heard about FTX
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   was one of my colleagues from Citadel Securities
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   told me, "Hey, did you ever work with this
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.000]   Sam Beckman Fried guy?"
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:36.000]   And I was like, "Yeah, a little bit, why?"
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   And they're like, "Do you know he's like a billionaire
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   and he has this Hong Kong crypto exchange?"
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   I'm like, "What? No. What? Since when?"
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   And then started to see him pop up in articles.
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   There was like a Vox article about him
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   and a few other things,
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   especially related to his political donations.
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   And that's kind of when I got back in touch with him
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   and we started talking a little bit.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   - When was it that he called you to say
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:01.000]   that there are potentially troubles
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   and I'm considering starting a political prediction market?
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   - That was in 2018.
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   - Okay, got it, got it.
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   - So it was right after I left Jane Street.
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   - Got it, okay.
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   And so now you've moved on to Citadel
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   and so I guess you're still in touch at this point.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   - Yeah, like very briefly, you know,
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:19.000]   a text every now and then.
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   - Okay, and then at some point
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   you become president of FTX US.
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   So do you want to talk about like,
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   I guess how he approached you about that
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   and what was going on at the time?
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   - Yeah, it was interesting.
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   So at the time I was running
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   what was called the semi-systematic trading technology
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   at Citadel Securities.
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:45.000]   And so this was the group of technologists
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   working on systems for ADRs, ETFs, options
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.000]   and OTC market equities.
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   So it's around a hundred software engineers or so
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   that rolled up to me.
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.000]   And, you know, that was going well,
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   but, you know, Sam and I started talking.
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   It was, I guess, March of 2021.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   And, you know, he was like telling me
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   a couple of things going on in FTX.
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:07.000]   And then he said, you know,
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   if you're interested in coming over to FTX,
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   we would still love to have you.
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   And I thought, still,
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:17.000]   we never talked about doing this before,
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   but sure, like let's entertain this.
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.000]   And then we started talking and he had me meet him
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   and Gary and Nishad over, you know, video call.
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.000]   I was in Chicago, they were in Hong Kong at the time.
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   These calls were taking place like late at night, my time.
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:34.000]   And very quickly, like an offer came together
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   and I thought, you know,
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.000]   this is like a really cool opportunity
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.000]   to jump into a field and take a role
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.000]   that was very different from stuff I'd done in the past.
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.000]   And I signed up.
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   - Got it, okay.
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:47.000]   And what, where was FTX at this point
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:49.000]   in terms of its sort of business development?
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:53.000]   - Yeah, so FTX was doing quite well.
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:55.000]   I mean, it was basically finished its first,
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.000]   its second year of operation.
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:02.000]   And it was maybe the fourth or fifth largest exchange
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:04.000]   in the world by volume.
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   If you include, you know, crypto,
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:07.000]   spot crypto and crypto derivatives.
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:11.000]   And it was also one of the primary destinations
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   for institutions, you know,
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:16.000]   proprietary trading firms, hedge funds,
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   to trade crypto and derivatives especially
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.000]   because of how it was designed.
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.000]   And so it was doing really well.
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:26.000]   FTX US was virtually non-existent.
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:27.000]   You know, they had started the,
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:29.000]   they formed the entities,
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:31.000]   they had started the exchange,
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:35.000]   I think in either December, 2020 or January, 2021.
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   But it had like de minimis volume compared
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:39.000]   to the other, you know, exchanges around the world,
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   especially in the US too.
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.000]   And, you know, Sam talked to me a lot
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:45.000]   about a lot of the aspirations for the US business.
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   You know, one to grow the spot exchange, of course.
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:52.000]   Two was to be able to find a regulated path
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:55.000]   for bringing some of these offshore products like,
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.000]   you know, Bitcoin and Ether futures
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:00.000]   and options onshore in a regulated way.
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:02.000]   And on top of that, Sam had also told me
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:05.000]   about kind of longer-term desires
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:09.000]   to be a single app or marketplace for everything,
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:10.000]   not just crypto.
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:13.000]   So, you know, launching a stocks trading platform as well.
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.000]   And so that was, I think, one of the reasons I think
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:16.000]   he wanted to bring me on was
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:18.000]   because I had all this experience kind of inside
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:20.000]   of regulated broker-dealers and sort of knew roughly
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:22.000]   what it took to get that started.
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:23.000]   - Okay, got it.
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:27.000]   And so he, and the initial offer was specifically
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:30.000]   for president of FTX US, right?
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   - Yeah, and Sam wasn't someone who loved thinking hard
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:36.000]   about titles and even like what my original title
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.000]   was going to be was like a point of contention,
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.000]   but I'm not sure it was clear exactly
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:42.000]   what my role was going to be.
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:46.000]   I think Sam wanted me to like write software
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:49.000]   for FTX and FTX US, sorry, for FTX US.
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   But to me, I sort of thought there was like
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:56.000]   this bigger opportunity to kind of work with Sam
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:59.000]   to lead this other startup, which was FTX US
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.000]   and kind of build it up and sort of follow
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:03.000]   in FTX's footsteps and its success.
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.000]   And that was the part that was most exciting to me
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:07.000]   because this is what I've been doing now for years.
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:09.000]   It's like managing large teams of people,
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:11.000]   thinking about strategy, getting people together,
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:13.000]   you know, occasionally doing some software development myself.
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.000]   But, you know, that was the primary reason
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:17.000]   for wanting to join.
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:18.000]   - Got it.
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:21.000]   And what was the relationship between FTX and FTX US
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:22.000]   at that time?
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:23.000]   Were they kind of subsidiaries?
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   Were they separate entities?
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:26.000]   - They were separate entities.
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.000]   They weren't subsidiaries.
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.000]   There was technology sharing between them.
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:33.000]   So like the FTX US exchange technology
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:35.000]   was like licensed from FTX.
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:38.000]   You can think of FTX US was like FTX stripping away
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.000]   like most of the interesting parts of FTX, right?
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:42.000]   'Cause it was just, you know,
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:45.000]   a dozen or two spot tokens.
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:47.000]   And when I joined, there were very few people
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   within FTX US, you know, maybe like two
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:51.000]   or three dedicated people.
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:54.000]   So over the course of the next year or so,
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:57.000]   you know, my job that I sort of, you know,
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:00.000]   fit for myself was to like open up some offices,
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:02.000]   like hire a bunch of people,
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.000]   establish like separate compliance
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.000]   and legal and operational and support teams,
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:09.000]   start to build out these regulated entities.
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:12.000]   - Was Chicago the initial base of that operation?
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.000]   - Yeah, I mean, for selfish reasons.
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   Like I have like my family is here, you know,
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.000]   and, you know, I wasn't going anywhere.
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:22.000]   But also I thought Chicago was a great place
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:25.000]   for FTX US because if our main goal
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:27.000]   was to establish, you know, regulated derivatives,
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:30.000]   like Chicago is really the place where that happens.
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.000]   We have like the CME,
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:36.000]   we have many of the top proprietary trading firms,
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:38.000]   a lot of like the Futures Commission merchants
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:40.000]   and various brokers are all here, you know,
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:42.000]   historically like the kind of the floor
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.000]   of like the Chicago Board of Trade
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:46.000]   and like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:47.000]   like they're here.
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:50.000]   And so it kind of felt like a good place to be.
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:55.000]   - And at this point, I guess before you joined,
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:57.000]   did you get a chance to ask him
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:01.000]   about the relationship between FTX and Alameda?
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:02.000]   - Yeah, I did.
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.000]   I mean, it was definitely of interest to me,
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:07.000]   like, you know, because I mean,
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:09.000]   the primary reason being that I wasn't interested
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:10.000]   in doing prop again.
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:12.000]   You know, like I worked at Jane Street,
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:13.000]   I worked at Headlands Tech,
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.000]   I was at Citadel Securities.
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:19.000]   If I wanted to continue doing prop trading,
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:22.000]   I would have stayed at one of those places, you know?
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:25.000]   So I wanted to do this exchange business.
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:26.000]   And what Sam told me,
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:28.000]   it was the same thing he said publicly everywhere,
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:29.000]   which is that, yeah,
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:31.000]   like Alameda is basically running itself.
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.000]   All of Sam's time is on FTX.
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:36.000]   They're kind of walled off from the FTX people.
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:38.000]   And, you know, their access to the exchange
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:40.000]   is just like any other market maker.
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:42.000]   Like there's like the public API feeds,
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:44.000]   you know, there's, you know,
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:46.000]   benefits for market makers that trade enough volume,
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:47.000]   but it's not like, you know,
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.000]   Alameda had any special privileges in that sense.
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:52.000]   And so I thought they were just basically separate.
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:55.000]   - And did you ask to, I guess,
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:56.000]   audit their sort of financials
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:59.000]   or this relationship before you joined?
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:01.000]   - No, I mean, I don't know about you,
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:03.000]   but I've never like gotten an offer to a company
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.000]   and said like, well, before I sign,
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.000]   please show me your audited financials.
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:09.000]   It's just like not a thing that happens.
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:11.000]   - Right, right, okay.
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:12.000]   Fair enough.
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:14.000]   So you joined FTX,
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:16.000]   and then you mentioned some of the stuff
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:19.000]   you were working on, the operational, legal,
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:20.000]   getting the organization set up.
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:23.000]   But yeah, feel free to talk in more detail
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:25.000]   about what were the things that came up
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:26.000]   during your tenure
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:29.000]   and what are the accomplishments you're proud of?
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:32.000]   - Yeah, I guess on the professional and personal front.
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:33.000]   So I guess on a professional front,
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:37.000]   I'm most proud of like establishing out our team
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.000]   and making significant headway
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:41.000]   to a lot of our goals
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:43.000]   to establish these regulated businesses.
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:45.000]   So for example, Ledger X,
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:46.000]   we acquired Ledger X
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:49.000]   and we had this application to the CFTC
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:52.000]   to enable kind of real-time direct-to-customer
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:55.000]   24/7 margining and cross-collateralization.
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:59.000]   And it was an extremely innovative proposal
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:01.000]   and it felt like we were making real progress
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:06.000]   towards establishing new and very exciting regimes
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:09.000]   for CFTC regulated derivatives in the US.
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:12.000]   I also established a broker dealer in the US
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:15.000]   for the purposes of letting people trade stocks
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:16.000]   like S'mores Robinhood.
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:19.000]   I wrote like 90% of all the code
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:22.000]   for that stocks platform myself.
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:26.000]   And yeah, I was very proud of that accomplishment.
[00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:27.000]   And then just on a personal front,
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:31.000]   it was great to get embedded into the crypto industry.
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:33.000]   I was very excited by everything that I saw.
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:35.000]   It was great to make all the connections
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:38.000]   through FTX with like the different people
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:39.000]   in the crypto ecosystem
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:42.000]   and become friends with these people
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:44.000]   and that certainly has influenced where I am today.
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:46.000]   So I'm sort of proud of all of that.
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:50.000]   - How did you manage the management of,
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:52.000]   I don't know how big the team was, so to speak.
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:55.000]   And it sounds like you were heavily, I mean,
[00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:58.000]   involved is an understatement in the actual engineering.
[00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000]   How were we able to manage both roles at the same time?
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.000]   - Yeah, so we were like between 75 and 100
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.000]   total people in the US and it was challenging.
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000]   It was one of my biggest complaints,
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.000]   which I'm sure we'll get into,
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:13.000]   which is that, yes, I can write code,
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.000]   but I feel like that's my comparative advantage
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.000]   is helping kind of the leverage teams of people
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.000]   to get them to work towards the common goal
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:26.000]   of building out large distributed systems
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.000]   that are complex and multivariate in nature.
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:33.000]   And the best use of my time was not me programming
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:36.000]   between the hours of like 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. every night
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000]   while trying to keep on board with like
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.000]   what all the personnel were doing.
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.000]   - Yeah.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.000]   - So I really wanted to grow the US team significantly
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.000]   to at least be more than a handful of developers.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:53.000]   And so yeah, that was one of the initial points of contention.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000]   - Okay, speak more about that.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000]   So he was opposed to growing the team?
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000]   - Sam would frequently talk publicly about
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:03.000]   how proud he was that all of FTX was built
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:07.000]   by two developers and all of these crazy organizations
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000]   that hire thousands of developers
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.000]   and can't get anything done,
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:12.000]   like they should learn from me about how
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:16.000]   like a small lean team can be much more effective.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000]   And there's some truth to that.
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:22.000]   You know, I do think the conventional wisdom now
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:25.000]   is a lot of big tech companies overhired
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000]   or software engineers.
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.000]   And not only was it sort of an expense on the balance sheet,
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.000]   but it was also expensive in terms of slowing down
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.000]   the kind of operational efficiency of the organization
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.000]   and having a small lean team can help you get
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.000]   to your first or your nth product a lot more quickly.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000]   That's great for a startup.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:49.000]   But once you're like a north of $10 billion valuation company,
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:54.000]   like promising the world to like customers and investors,
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000]   two software developers doesn't really cut it anymore.
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000]   I mean, at some point you have to like, you know,
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:02.000]   grow up and face the reality that it's time
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:05.000]   to actually grow an organization into a real
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:09.000]   kind of managed enterprise with teams of software engineers
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000]   specializing in certain tasks.
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.000]   And so there was always pushback.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000]   You know, people would tell me like, look,
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:19.000]   we're not trying to be like Jane Street or Citadel
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000]   in terms of our number of software engineers.
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.000]   Like we want to stay lean.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000]   That's our comparative advantage.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:28.000]   And most importantly, they didn't want two separate
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000]   development teams, like one in the US,
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000]   one in the Bahamas.
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:35.000]   Like they wanted to keep the nexus of software development
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.000]   underneath, you know, Nishat and Gary in the Bahamas,
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.000]   which I just thought wasn't going to be sustainable long-term.
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000]   Like if you run a broker-dealer in the US,
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:47.000]   you need to have staff that is specifically allocated
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000]   towards broker-dealer activities.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.000]   It can't be that if FINRA comes and says like,
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000]   oh, who's working on the broker-dealer?
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000]   You say, well, it's like this Gary guy who like lives
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.000]   in the Bahamas who sometimes is awake at like 4 a.m.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.000]   and spends 20 minutes a day thinking about stocks.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.000]   Like that can't fly.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.000]   Right, right.
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000]   And has no images of him on the internet.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.000]   No, yeah.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:12.000]   Okay, so we're Nishat and Gary contributing code
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000]   to the FTX US code base?
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:18.000]   Remember, like the FTX US side of things was
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.000]   a strict subset of FTX.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:25.000]   So like in that sense, it kind of flowed into FTX US
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.000]   with the exception of the like FTX US derivatives,
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000]   the Ledger X stuff was like actually a completely
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.000]   separate team because that was through an acquisition.
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000]   When you're talking about the code of like the matching engine
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:38.000]   or things like that, was the code shared
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.000]   between FTX and FTX US?
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.000]   Yes.
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.000]   Okay.
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:46.000]   Like who was in charge of ultimately like the push,
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000]   like approving the pull request basically
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000]   of the FTX US code base?
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000]   Yeah, it was like all Gary and Nishat.
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.000]   Okay, got it.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000]   And so the code you were contributing was also going to
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000]   the sort of like universal global code base?
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.000]   Yeah.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000]   Got it.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.000]   Did you have sort of access to the entire code base
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000]   or just the FTX US side?
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000]   Yeah, again, it was one shared repo.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000]   I mean, there was an enormous amount of code.
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.000]   And one of the big problems,
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000]   another problem that I raised while I was there
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:18.000]   was that 90 plus percent of all the code of FTX
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000]   was written by these two people.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.000]   And it was very hard to follow.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.000]   I don't know if you've ever seen
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000]   like a large Python code base before.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:30.000]   And so whenever there were issues that arose,
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000]   you know, oh, like there's like this particular problem
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.000]   with like an account on the exchange.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:37.000]   The only answer was like call Nishat, call Gary,
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:41.000]   which I also knew to be like unsustainable
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.000]   from the organizational perspective.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000]   Like one of the like guiding principles
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.000]   at Jaintree, for example, was, you know,
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.000]   mentor your junior dev so that you can hand off
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000]   all your responsibilities to them.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000]   And in the process of handing off responsibilities,
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000]   you make the code better, more automated,
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.000]   more robust problems, more easily, you know,
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000]   debuggable in real time.
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:04.000]   If you hoard everything to yourself in your own brain,
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:07.000]   you end up with a code base that is just
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:10.000]   only understandable by that one person.
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000]   And so it was the kind of thing where,
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000]   and a lot of people talked about this internally,
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000]   like if Gary like got hit by a bus
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:19.000]   and like couldn't come to work at it anymore.
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.000]   - FTX is done.
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:23.000]   - It's done, it's done, exactly, exactly.
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:26.000]   - What do you think was the motivation behind this?
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000]   Was it just that he wanted to keep,
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000]   wanted to avoid as a sort of like Google growing
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.000]   to 100,000 people kind of thing?
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000]   Or was there something else going on?
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000]   Like why did it, why this sort of concentration?
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:40.000]   - Well, clearly there was something else going on.
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000]   I think an open question now,
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000]   only thinking about this in hindsight,
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:48.000]   was how much of this like very boistered
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:53.000]   organizational decision around the development team
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:57.000]   was a function of the various things they were doing
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:00.000]   that they were hiding from the rest of the company?
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:04.000]   Or was it really this sort of like one ultra paranoia
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.000]   about growing too large too quickly
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000]   and losing control of the organization?
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:16.000]   And two, an almost like sort of cult-like belief
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:20.000]   in this small team like being the but-for cause
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.000]   of all past, present, and future success.
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:26.000]   - What was the discretion that you had at FTX US?
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.000]   It sounds like you weren't even given the capacity
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.000]   to like hire more engineers if you wanted to.
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.000]   - Right.
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000]   - What were the things you did control?
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.000]   - Yeah, hiring for example.
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000]   Like I began pushed for many months
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000]   that we should hire more people.
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.000]   Eventually I got permission for us to interview people,
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.000]   but then those would ultimately have to get finally approved
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000]   by the people in the Bahamas.
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.000]   And they would frequently say no.
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.000]   It's the people who I thought were good candidates.
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000]   Finally, we hired one person
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:58.000]   and this person was doing well.
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000]   He was here in Chicago
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:05.000]   and they invited him to go spend like a month in the Bahamas.
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000]   To kind of hang out with them
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:10.000]   and supposedly just like ramp up on the system.
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000]   And this person comes back to Chicago and they say,
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.000]   "You know what?
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.000]   "I really want to move to the Bahamas."
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000]   They really kind of convinced me to do it.
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000]   And it was so frustrating.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.000]   - Poaching from your own company.
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:20.000]   - Exactly.
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.000]   It was such a constant battle.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.000]   And at some point I kind of gave up on this idea
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000]   that I was going to be able to actually grow
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000]   this separate developer team.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000]   So, I mean, the bottom line is
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:34.000]   on kind of like the day-to-day operational stuff,
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000]   especially the decisions within
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000]   some of the things I was responsible for,
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:42.000]   like the stocks trading platform that I was working on.
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000]   I had a fair amount of discretion
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:47.000]   and people certainly looked up to me
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:51.000]   for management and advice and direction.
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:55.000]   But ultimately the discretion ended up
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:59.000]   with this small group in the Bahamas
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:02.000]   who not only had final say on decisions,
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.000]   but would often make decisions
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000]   and not communicate with the senior people
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.000]   on the U.S. side.
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.000]   And we would just sort of find out things were happening.
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.000]   - Is there a specific example
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000]   or set of examples that comes to mind?
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.000]   - Sure.
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000]   The biggest example for me was,
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.000]   this was sort of post my kind of effective resignation,
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:23.000]   but some of these strategic acquisitions
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000]   that were being done in the U.S.
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000]   during the summer of 2022,
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.000]   I would find out from like the news.
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:33.000]   Or like it would sort of be mentioned
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:36.000]   on a signal chat or something that this was happening.
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000]   And there was like no opportunity
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000]   to actually like wade into the discussion
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.000]   about how this is like gonna greatly affect
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.000]   like the U.S. business.
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000]   It's gonna greatly affect our priorities.
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000]   And it wasn't clear if this was like a good decision
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.000]   or a bad decision.
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000]   It was just like a unilateral decision that was made.
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000]   Like, oh, we're acquiring this company
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000]   or we have the option to acquire this company.
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:59.000]   - Are there decisions that were made from the Bahamas
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:04.000]   that stick out to you as being unwise?
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000]   That like, I don't know, you try to speak out against.
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000]   I mean, you mentioned some of them, right?
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.000]   Like not hiring enough people
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:12.000]   and not getting more, yeah, not getting more developers.
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000]   But are there other things like that
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000]   that stick out to you as bad decisions?
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:19.000]   - A lot of the spending, I mean,
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:23.000]   on everything from like lavish real estate
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000]   to all of these like partnerships
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:29.000]   to very, very large venture deals.
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.000]   Like these were the kinds of things in the company
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:36.000]   where people asked like, when does this stop?
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:39.000]   Like to one end, are we doing a lot of these things?
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.000]   And some of those resulted
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000]   in sort of like direct confrontations.
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:45.000]   Like just, you know, why are we doing yet another deal
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000]   with like a sports person or a celebrity?
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000]   This is like, this is ridiculous.
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000]   Like this is not doing anything for the company.
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000]   And we're completely distracting
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000]   from the role that we thought we all had,
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000]   which was to build a really great core product
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000]   for, you know, people trading crypto,
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.000]   on crypto derivatives.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.000]   - Yeah, and did you bring this up directly with SBF?
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.000]   - Yeah, multiple times.
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000]   - And how would he respond?
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:09.000]   - Sometimes he was, you know, nice about it.
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:10.000]   And he would say, you know, like,
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000]   "Yeah, like I see where you're coming from.
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000]   "I do think what we've done so far
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000]   "has been really valuable.
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000]   "And we probably should do some more of it.
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000]   "But maybe at some point we should stop."
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000]   You know, a lot of this sort of like hedging language
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.000]   that was ultimately non-confrontational, non-committal.
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000]   I mean, he was a very non-confrontational person,
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:30.000]   very conflict avoidant person in the company.
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.000]   So, and then at worst, he would just, you know,
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000]   there were other times where I brought up
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:38.000]   like specific things I thought like he was doing wrong.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:41.000]   There was one really unfortunate time where I,
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000]   it was the first time I visited the Bahamas
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:46.000]   in, I think it was like November of '21.
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:49.000]   And I'm the kind of person who like,
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000]   if I see something wrong at a company,
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.000]   it doesn't matter what company I've worked at
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000]   or how junior or senior I've been.
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000]   Like, I like to go to the person most senior in charge
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000]   and tell them like, "This thing seems wrong to me."
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:01.000]   And that's, I feel like it's one of my like superpowers.
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.000]   I'm just like not being afraid of just like saying
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000]   when something seems wrong to me.
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000]   And sometimes like I'm just totally wrong
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:09.000]   and don't understand the full picture.
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000]   And sometimes it results in something better happening
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:15.000]   and people will, you know, thank me for having been honest
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000]   and bringing to attention something that's actually wrong.
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000]   And so I said to Sam, you know,
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:24.000]   I think you're doing way too much PR and media.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:30.000]   Like, first of all, it's really diluting you
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:36.000]   and the FTX brand to constantly be doing TV interviews
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:40.000]   and podcasts and, you know, flying to banking
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000]   and private equity conferences.
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.000]   And, you know, it was so much time spent on this stuff.
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000]   And also it was completely taken away
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000]   from the management of the company.
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000]   You know, people would sometimes send Sam Slack
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000]   or signal messages and not get responses
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000]   for weeks at a time.
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:58.000]   And it felt like he was spending virtually no time
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000]   helping the company move forward.
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:03.000]   It was so much about image and brand and PR.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:09.000]   And he was really angry at hearing this criticism directly.
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:10.000]   - How did he react?
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:14.000]   - I mean, he was just, he was sort of emotional.
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.000]   He was worked up.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:18.000]   He told me like, I completely disagree with you.
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000]   I mean, he said like, I think you're completely wrong.
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:23.000]   He said, I think the stuff that I've done for PR
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000]   is maybe the greatest thing that's happened to this company.
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:26.000]   I should do more of it.
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000]   I didn't think it was physically possible
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000]   to do more of it.
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:33.000]   And I realized at that moment
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:37.000]   that this was not really gonna work super well long-term.
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000]   Like if we're not in a relationship
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000]   where I can give sort of my direct superior,
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:45.000]   like real honest, constructive criticism
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000]   that I thought was for the good of the company
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.000]   that this wasn't really going to work.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000]   - He actually did my podcast about,
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000]   I don't know, eight months ago or something.
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000]   And while I was like very grateful he did it,
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000]   even at the time I'm like,
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:01.000]   I don't know if I would have agreed to this
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000]   if I was in charge of a $30 billion empire.
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:07.000]   - Yeah, I mean, sometimes like some reporters would say to me,
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:11.000]   like, you know, can you like get me in touch with Sam?
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000]   And I would say, you know, why?
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.000]   Like, I'm not really his keeper.
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000]   You can contact him yourself.
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000]   They're like, oh, because we wanna come to Bahamas
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:19.000]   and do a special on him.
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:20.000]   And I would say like, okay,
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000]   but you're gonna be like the sixth one this month.
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:23.000]   (laughing)
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000]   - There's no exclusives here.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:28.000]   So I guess to steel man his point,
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:32.000]   he did get a lot of good PR at the time, right?
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000]   Potentially, well, not potentially,
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:37.000]   like actually too much.
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000]   And in a way that like really created
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:42.000]   at the time sort of like the king of crypto sort of image.
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:45.000]   So, I mean, was he right about the impact
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000]   of the PR at the time?
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:50.000]   Or maybe, let me ask the question a different way.
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000]   How did he create this image?
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:53.000]   I mean, people were saying
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.000]   that he's the JP Morgan of crypto.
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000]   Like you could do no wrong.
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.000]   Even things that in retrospect seem like clear mistakes,
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000]   like only having a few developers on the team.
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:04.000]   I universally praise, you know,
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000]   huge empire run by a few developers.
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000]   How was this image created?
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:11.000]   - I think that media was primed
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:16.000]   for the archetype that was Sam.
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:20.000]   This sort of young upstart prodigy
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:23.000]   in the realm of FinTech.
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000]   You know, we have a lot of these characters
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:29.000]   in the world of, you know, big tech.
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000]   And I think that he had a particular role to play
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000]   in the world of finance.
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:39.000]   And by making himself so accessible all the time,
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:42.000]   he gave people a drug that they were addicted to,
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000]   which was like that constant access.
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000]   I feel like any time of day or night,
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:49.000]   someone could text Sam and get him on the phone with them
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:52.000]   if they were in media.
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:53.000]   And they loved it.
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000]   It was like getting access to a direct expert
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000]   who was also this famous person
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000]   who was also this billionaire,
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000]   who was also this extremely well-connected person,
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:04.000]   who was also this very insightful person
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000]   who knew a lot was going on in the industry
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:09.000]   and can give them like insight and tips.
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:14.000]   And I think there was some amount of what I like to call
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000]   like reputation laundering going on here,
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000]   where it was like, okay,
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:22.000]   so you get the famous celebrity to endorse Sam,
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:25.000]   which makes, you know, this, you know,
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000]   politician think highly of Sam
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000]   because they also like that celebrity.
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000]   And then also the investors are writing
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000]   really great positive things online about it.
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:36.000]   But also the media is enforcing how cool it is
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000]   that Sam is doing all these other things.
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.000]   And it all sort of fed into this like flywheel
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:44.000]   of building up Sam's image over time
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.000]   in a way that didn't necessarily need
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:50.000]   to like match the underlying reality
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000]   of who he was at the company.
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:55.000]   - And what was the reaction of other employees at FTX
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:59.000]   of this sort of, not only the media hype train,
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:02.000]   but also the amount of time Sam was spending with the media?
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000]   - You know, on one hand,
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:08.000]   I think people were growing frustrated within the company
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000]   because of the lack of direction
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000]   and some of like the power vacuums
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:16.000]   that resulted from Sam's continual absence.
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:19.000]   On the other hand, so many people within the company
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000]   just hero worship Sam.
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:25.000]   You know, when you hear all like the really tragic stories
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:29.000]   now of all the employees who kept all of their like funds
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000]   and life savings on FTX,
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:35.000]   they really, really believed in Sam.
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000]   And it doesn't matter how little time
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:38.000]   he spent with the company,
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000]   it doesn't matter how he treated employees internally.
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:45.000]   It was like he was this sort of genius pioneer
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:48.000]   and that image couldn't be shaken.
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000]   - I mean, I certainly don't blame anybody for it.
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:51.000]   I interviewed him.
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000]   I tried to do a lot of research before I interviewed him
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000]   and I certainly was like totally taken with this, right?
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000]   I thought he was the most competent person
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000]   who had ever graced crypto.
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:04.000]   But so what was he actually like as a manager and leader
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.000]   other than, I guess,
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000]   obviously the micromanaging aspect of it?
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000]   Or feel free to speak more on that as well,
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000]   but in terms of the decisions he would make
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:15.000]   in terms of business development and prioritizing things,
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:18.000]   can you describe his sort of management style and leadership?
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000]   - In the beginning, when I joined FTX,
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:23.000]   my initial impressions were that
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:30.000]   he had pretty clear intuition and insight
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:35.000]   into the simple things to do that would work.
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000]   You know, in many ways,
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000]   as you think about what FTX did,
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000]   it wasn't really super complicated.
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:45.000]   It was like just be operationally good
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:48.000]   and give your trading customers
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:51.000]   as predictable of an experience as possible
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:55.000]   with regards to lateral management and auto liquidation
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:00.000]   and matching engine behavior and latency.
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.000]   And so they did it.
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:06.000]   I would say, aside from the intuition,
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000]   Sam wasn't a details man.
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.000]   Like that was usually left up to the people below him
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:12.000]   to really take care of.
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:15.000]   It was like to drive a project to completion,
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000]   to figure out all the details that had to be done.
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:20.000]   I think besides that, as a leader,
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000]   I thought he was fairly incompetent.
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:26.000]   I thought he was very conflict avoidant.
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:29.000]   He didn't like to get into direct confrontation
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:30.000]   with any of his employees,
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:34.000]   where most of the reasons why people needed to talk to him
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:37.000]   were because there were significant issues,
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:40.000]   whether those were personnel or otherwise,
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000]   and he just blew them off.
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:46.000]   I mean, that was a frequent occurrence in the company.
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:49.000]   I mean, if you went to Bahamas,
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000]   and I went only a couple of times
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000]   to actually visit the office,
[01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:59.000]   if he was in the office, he was there all day on calls.
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000]   All day, whether those were with investors
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:05.000]   or with media, podcasts, whatever.
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:08.000]   It was just consistently just doing that.
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000]   And I saw very, very little time
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000]   where he actually caught up and talked to anyone else
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000]   within the company about anything.
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:18.000]   So I think, to me, that was the primary impression I got
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:22.000]   of his leadership was virtually that there was none,
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:25.000]   which made me feel a lot like I and others needed to step up
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:28.000]   and sort of take that role in the absence.
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:29.000]   - Got it.
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:32.000]   And then so who was making these day-to-day decisions
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000]   in the absence of Sam?
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:39.000]   - On the foreign side, in the Bahamas,
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:42.000]   Nishad was really like the number two person there.
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000]   I mean, he was making a lot of decisions.
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:45.000]   There were a couple others in the Bahamas
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:48.000]   who were taking kind of swaths of the company,
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:52.000]   whether it was investments or marketing or legal,
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.000]   things like that.
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000]   On the U.S. side, we had a different crew
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:58.000]   trying to make decisions where we could
[01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:01.000]   for U.S.-regulated matters.
[01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:05.000]   But again, we were always sort of below
[01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:08.000]   the decision-making authority that was happening
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000]   in the Bahamas, especially inside of the home
[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.000]   where they were all living.
[01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:16.000]   - So it seems like FTX was a really good product
[01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000]   compared to other crypto exchanges.
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000]   I've heard a lot of traders praise it.
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:25.000]   Was this competence sort of built while SBF
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:28.000]   was still doing media stuff, or was this built
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:32.000]   before he kind of went on the PR train?
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:35.000]   How was this product built while the CEO
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000]   was kind of distracted?
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:40.000]   - So I think the core of the product was built
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:43.000]   before my time, and my understanding was
[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:47.000]   in the transition from Alameda to FTX,
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:50.000]   where there was no publicity around Alameda,
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000]   there wasn't any publicity around FTX.
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:55.000]   It was very much like heads-down build mode
[01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000]   for several months, and just think, think, think
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000]   about the core product.
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:02.000]   Having been a trader on these different exchanges
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000]   around the world that also offer derivatives,
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:07.000]   and knowing all their problems, like for example,
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:11.000]   if you had an Ether futures position,
[01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:16.000]   and also an Ether spot position on this one exchange,
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:19.000]   you could get liquidated on your Ether futures position,
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000]   even if you had enough Ether spot as collateral,
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:24.000]   because you needed to have that spot crypto
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:28.000]   within the Ether futures spot collateral wallet,
[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:31.000]   which was different than the Ether spot wallet.
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:36.000]   And so it was this game of shifting assets
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000]   around to different wallets to make sure
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000]   you kept meeting your collateral requirements,
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000]   which was just an operational nightmare.
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:47.000]   And so Sam told and worked with Gary and Nishad
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:50.000]   to build basically a cross-collateralization system
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:54.000]   where you have just one wallet with all of your assets,
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:58.000]   all haircutted appropriately based on volatility
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000]   and liquidity, but then summing up
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:03.000]   to a single collateral value that represents
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000]   what you can put on in terms of margin
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000]   for all your positions.
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000]   Or having an auto-liquidation system
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000]   that doesn't just, the second that you're
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000]   slightly below your margin fraction,
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000]   send a giant market order into the book
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:18.000]   and dislocate the order book by 10%,
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:21.000]   it would automatically start liquidating
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:24.000]   small percentages of your portfolio at a time
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000]   to try to minimize market impact.
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:30.000]   And then if the position got too underwater,
[01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000]   it would auction that position off
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:35.000]   to backstop liquidity providers, a number of them,
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000]   who would then take on that position again
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:40.000]   without having to kind of rip through the book
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:41.000]   and cause dislocation.
[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000]   And so it was much more orderly,
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000]   it was much more predictable.
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:48.000]   And that had to have come from the initial intuitions
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000]   that Sam and his colleagues got
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000]   from being traders on these exchanges
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:55.000]   and thinking how should this work if it were perfect.
[01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:56.000]   So I do think in the beginning,
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:59.000]   they were really working on that product together.
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000]   And then once the success came
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:05.000]   and Sam got drunk on the celebrity
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:09.000]   of being so out there and known
[01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:12.000]   and having all these newfound connections,
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:15.000]   that things started to go by the wayside.
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000]   - You mentioned that one of these things
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:20.000]   that he was doing was making these sort of exorbitant deals
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:26.000]   with celebrities, with acquisitions, branding.
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000]   What was your understanding at the time
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:31.000]   of where the money to do this was coming from?
[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:34.000]   - Yeah, so for example, when I joined the company,
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:38.000]   FTX had just inked that Miami Heat deal,
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:41.000]   and I think it was something like 19 million a year.
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:44.000]   And I was like, well, that sounds like a lot of money, right?
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000]   But at the time, you could see
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:51.000]   the publicly reported volume on FTX.
[01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:56.000]   It was something around 15 to 20 billion in notional per day.
[01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:59.000]   The fee schedule was also public.
[01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:03.000]   So even at the highest volume tiers,
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000]   the take fee would be something like
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000]   two basis points per trade.
[01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:11.000]   So if you just did like $20 billion traded per day
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:14.000]   times two basis points times 365,
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000]   which because like crypto trades every single day,
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:21.000]   you can get a sense of how much money FTX was making a year.
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:24.000]   And at the time, I think the run rate for FTX
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:28.000]   was something like close to a billion dollars in income.
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:32.000]   And you think, okay, is $19 million
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:35.000]   a reasonable percentage of the total income
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:39.000]   to spend on a very significant, important marketing play?
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000]   I don't know, it feels kind of reasonable.
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000]   Like how much does Coca-Cola spend per year
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000]   on marketing as a percentage of their income?
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:48.000]   It's probably somewhere between like 50% and 130%.
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000]   I don't actually know what it is.
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000]   It doesn't seem crazy.
[01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000]   Yeah, but if you add on top of that,
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:58.000]   the real estate, the other sort of acquisitions.
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000]   Well, first of all, that stuff came later.
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:05.000]   And secondly, a lot of that wasn't known
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:09.000]   to the employees within the company.
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000]   Most of the venture deals,
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000]   the value of the real estate, et cetera,
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:17.000]   was non-public within the company.
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:21.000]   There were a hundred plus million dollar investments
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000]   into various companies and other investment funds
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000]   that were never discussed openly,
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000]   at least to the US people.
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000]   So it wasn't like there was sort of this clear
[01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:32.000]   internal accounting where people could look at it and say,
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000]   "Hey, are you really spending all this money
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:35.000]   "on all this stuff?"
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:39.000]   No, I think Sam very deliberately kept all that stuff
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:42.000]   within his innermost circle for a reason
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:43.000]   because he didn't want the criticism
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:44.000]   on what he was spending on.
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:48.000]   And did you have access to, or did you ask to see,
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:49.000]   I guess, a balance sheet
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:52.000]   or any of the sort of financial documents?
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:55.000]   I had zero access to bank account stuff
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:58.000]   or financials on the FTX.com side.
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000]   On the US, I had some.
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:04.000]   But remember now, knowing what we now know
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:09.000]   about even like recent, like the guilty pleas
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:12.000]   from the shod and seeing like the complaints
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:15.000]   from like the SEC, CFTC,
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:19.000]   they were like deliberately falsifying information
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:23.000]   that went into ultimately the audited financials.
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:27.000]   So in order to like actually have suspected anything,
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000]   one would have to not only like disagree
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:32.000]   with all of the kind of internal conventional wisdom
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000]   around how the company was doing,
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:38.000]   but also have to basically distrust audited financials
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000]   coming back to the company.
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:43.000]   Combined with having any concerns about income
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000]   when it seemed like we were generating income
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:48.000]   faster than any startup in history.
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:51.000]   So I think it was very difficult for anyone
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000]   within the company, especially in the US side,
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:54.000]   to have a clue what was going on.
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:55.000]   - Sure, sure.
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000]   Well, let's talk about Alameda.
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:00.000]   So I guess, again, maybe the best point
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:04.000]   to start this story is also with Jane Street,
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000]   where Caroline Ellison,
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000]   who went on to become the CEO of Alameda,
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:11.000]   was a trader.
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:14.000]   Did you happen to cross paths with her at Jane Street?
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000]   - So it's hard to remember
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:17.000]   'cause it was like the early days,
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:18.000]   but I'm pretty sure she was also
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:21.000]   one of my bootcamp students.
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:22.000]   - It all starts there.
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:23.000]   - Yeah.
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:26.000]   But besides those early interactions,
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000]   I barely interacted with Caroline,
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:31.000]   not in the same way that I had done with Sam,
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000]   just based on the trading desk he was on.
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000]   And when I joined the company,
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:38.000]   the FTX US people, communication-wise,
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:41.000]   were walled off from Alameda,
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:46.000]   so we didn't really cross paths almost at all.
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000]   - What was your understanding
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:51.000]   of the relationship between Alameda and FTX?
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:55.000]   - This is a completely separate company.
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000]   Sam doesn't really do anything for them anymore
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:00.000]   because he is 100% focused on FTX.
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:04.000]   It's separately being run by Caroline and Sam Tribucco.
[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:08.000]   They have the same access to the exchange,
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:09.000]   like data feeds and API,
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:12.000]   as any other market maker on the exchange.
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:15.000]   And also, especially towards the time that I left,
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:18.000]   Alameda wasn't even a significant percentage
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000]   of the exchange volume anymore.
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:23.000]   They weren't in the top 20 market makers
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000]   on FTX.com or something like that.
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:28.000]   - You mentioned that you were contributing
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000]   to the code base and you had access to the code base.
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:34.000]   People have been speculating about whether Gary or Nishad
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:37.000]   had hard-coded some sort of special limit for Alameda.
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:40.000]   Did you see any evidence of that in the code base?
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:41.000]   - Definitely not.
[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000]   - You mentioned that you visited
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000]   the Bahamas offices a few times.
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:50.000]   And there, like the Alameda, there's like four huts.
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:53.000]   And there's like a meeting room.
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:56.000]   There's where Sam and the engineers are.
[01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000]   There's the Future Fund.
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:01.000]   And then there's like the Alameda hut.
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:04.000]   Did the physical proximity between the offices
[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:07.000]   and of course the fact that the leaders were living together,
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:10.000]   was that something you like inquired about
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:11.000]   or were concerned with?
[01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:14.000]   - I never visited the places where they lived
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:17.000]   in that Albany section of the Bahamas.
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:21.000]   So I think I didn't fully grasp the extent
[01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000]   to which they were all like living
[01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000]   in this particular arrangement.
[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:30.000]   But I understood that as long as Sam
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:34.000]   was going to be the 90% owner or something of Alameda,
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000]   he would want oversight there.
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000]   And so having them close by made sense.
[01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:41.000]   But the actual hut set up was such,
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000]   it had like physical separation from minute to minute.
[01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:47.000]   So it wasn't like Alameda could overhear
[01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:48.000]   stuff happening on the exchange
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000]   or people in the exchange could overhear
[01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000]   stuff that was happening at Alameda.
[01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:53.000]   So to some extent it felt like,
[01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000]   well, at least they're going through the right motions
[01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000]   of setting up like physical separate buildings.
[01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000]   I mean, also this is not uncommon
[01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:03.000]   within like trading firms and investment banks, right?
[01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:07.000]   Like if you imagine there needs to be wall separation
[01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000]   between like buy side and sell side
[01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.000]   at different institutions.
[01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000]   And the way they do that is they put them
[01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:15.000]   like on different floors in the same building, right?
[01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000]   And sure, like they can meet each other
[01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:18.000]   for lunch in the lobby,
[01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:21.000]   but like they set up some actual physical separation.
[01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:22.000]   This is like super par for the course
[01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000]   when it comes to financial firms
[01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000]   that have these businesses that need to be
[01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:27.000]   walled off from each other.
[01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000]   And so that didn't seem like
[01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000]   a particularly strange thing to me at all.
[01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:34.000]   - Is there anything that in retrospect
[01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:37.000]   seems to you like a yellow flag or a red flag,
[01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000]   even if at the time it's something that
[01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:42.000]   might make sense in the grand scheme of things?
[01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:43.000]   - Yeah.
[01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:47.000]   The most obvious thing only in hindsight
[01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:52.000]   was that Sam liked to do bonuses
[01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000]   for the employees twice a year.
[01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000]   And, you know, once at the end of June,
[01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:57.000]   once at the end of December.
[01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000]   So they were like semester bonuses.
[01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000]   And in the previous semesters,
[01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000]   he had paid them like early, like, you know,
[01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:04.000]   in May for the first semester,
[01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:07.000]   in November or early December for the second one.
[01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:13.000]   And he was extremely late in doing the mid-year 2021,
[01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:16.000]   or 2022 bonuses.
[01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:19.000]   So much so that people in the company
[01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000]   started to freak out
[01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000]   because there was a lot of bad news in the press
[01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:26.000]   about other companies doing layoffs or folding.
[01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:30.000]   And it was, you know, two to three months late
[01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:33.000]   and people were like expecting to get bonuses,
[01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000]   to pay rent and, you know, do whatever.
[01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:36.000]   And this was just,
[01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000]   there was very little communication around this
[01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000]   and people were very concerned.
[01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:44.000]   So at the time, you know, people said,
[01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000]   look, Sam's like really busy.
[01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000]   He's flying to DC every week.
[01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:49.000]   He has all this stuff going on.
[01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000]   Like he just hasn't gotten around to it,
[01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:52.000]   but don't worry, it's coming.
[01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:55.000]   In hindsight, I felt like there was some clear,
[01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:56.000]   you know, liquidity issue.
[01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:57.000]   - Oh, wow.
[01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000]   - You know, that was probably the most obvious thing.
[01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:02.000]   I think everything else is all just things
[01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:05.000]   that were red flags about the organization,
[01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000]   not red flags about, you know,
[01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000]   potential liquidity issues or fraud.
[01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:10.000]   Things like, you know,
[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:13.000]   the complete inability to hire, you know, more people,
[01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000]   especially on the developer side,
[01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:18.000]   not allowing me to like establish
[01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:22.000]   separate sort of C-level staff on the U.S. side
[01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:23.000]   that would have, you know,
[01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000]   authority that was really separate
[01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000]   from the ones in the Bahamas.
[01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:32.000]   How completely tightly controlled the dev team was
[01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:36.000]   around access to the code base
[01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000]   and the inner workings of all the exchange
[01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:41.000]   and really wanting to keep that nexus of developer,
[01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000]   the developer group in the Bahamas
[01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000]   next to Gary and Nishad.
[01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000]   Those seem like red flags now.
[01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:50.000]   - Yeah, but not at the time.
[01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:53.000]   Did you notice anything weird
[01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000]   during the Terra Luna collapse?
[01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000]   Because in the aftermath, people have said
[01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000]   that that's probably when Alameda defaulted
[01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:03.000]   on some loans and maybe some,
[01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:06.000]   the sort of like hole dug itself deeper.
[01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:07.000]   - Really nothing at all.
[01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:08.000]   - Okay.
[01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:11.000]   - I mean, maybe that's a function of being here in Chicago
[01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:15.000]   and just not seeing a group of people freaking out,
[01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:18.000]   but nothing seemed wrong at all.
[01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:21.000]   In fact, we started having conversations around,
[01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000]   you know, paying out mid-year bonuses
[01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:26.000]   a couple of weeks later after Terra announcement
[01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000]   and everything seemed very normal.
[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:31.000]   Sam sent out an announcement to the whole company
[01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:32.000]   basically saying like,
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000]   "Okay, we're going to be paying out bonuses soon.
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000]   "People should expect they're going to be
[01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:37.000]   "like a little bit lower
[01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:40.000]   "because we have very similar revenue to last year,
[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000]   "but we've also grown in size
[01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:43.000]   "and also like the market is slowing
[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000]   "and we need to be a little bit more conservative."
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:50.000]   So all the signs pointed to like things as normal.
[01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:53.000]   - You said, so you had a thread sort of boiling down
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:54.000]   this experience on Twitter.
[01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000]   And one of the things you pointed out there
[01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:00.000]   is that you saw the sort of symptoms
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:03.000]   of the sort of mental health issue
[01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:07.000]   or addiction issue at the time.
[01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000]   Are you, there, are you referring
[01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:12.000]   to these sort of management mishaps
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:13.000]   and bad decision-making
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000]   or was there something more
[01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000]   that made you come to this conclusion?
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:18.000]   - I think it was more than that.
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000]   You know, when I knew Sam,
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:23.000]   when he was 21, 22 years old,
[01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:27.000]   he was like a happy, like healthy looking kid
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:33.000]   who was, you know, very positive, very talkative,
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:37.000]   got along super well with his cohort of traders.
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:40.000]   The people on the desk really liked him.
[01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000]   When I got to FTX,
[01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:45.000]   I think over the course of my time there,
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:48.000]   I saw someone who was very different
[01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:49.000]   than that person I remembered.
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000]   I think he was angrier,
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:54.000]   seemed more depressed, more anxious.
[01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000]   You know, he couldn't get through a conversation
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:57.000]   without shaking his leg.
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:00.000]   - That wasn't, at Jane Street, he wasn't like that?
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000]   - Not something I remember at all.
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000]   You know, he would snap easily.
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000]   He would not respond to messages
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000]   for long periods of time.
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:11.000]   And people had different theories.
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:12.000]   I mean, people would attribute it
[01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:13.000]   to the unbelievable stress
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:14.000]   of being in the position that he was in.
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:18.000]   The complete lack of sleep, like his diet,
[01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:19.000]   lack of exercise.
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:22.000]   I mean, people had plenty of thoughts
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000]   about what could be causing it all,
[01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000]   but something definitely had deteriorated
[01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000]   like mentally and physically about him
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:29.000]   from who I remembered.
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:32.000]   - If you had to guess most likely cause of that,
[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000]   what would you say?
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:35.000]   - I don't know.
[01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:39.000]   I think that's up for a professional
[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000]   with credentials that I don't have.
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:44.000]   But I do think it was probably
[01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:45.000]   a combination of everything.
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:50.000]   The lack of sleep, the stress he probably was under,
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000]   not just being in his role,
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:56.000]   but having kept this secret for so many years
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000]   around, you know, whatever was happening
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000]   with the holes in the exchange
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:04.000]   and the lying he was doing to his own employees,
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:07.000]   to investors, to auditors.
[01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000]   Maybe that weighed on him.
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:12.000]   Maybe it had something to do with his medications.
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:15.000]   Maybe it just had to be just a plain deterioration
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:18.000]   in mental state or some kind of personality disorder
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:21.000]   or a different kind of anxiety disorder.
[01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:22.000]   I really don't know.
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:23.000]   Maybe a mixture of everything.
[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:24.000]   - Yeah, got it.
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:28.000]   You said you gave him a sort of ultimatum letter
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000]   where you said, "Unless you change these things,
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:31.000]   I'm resigning."
[01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:34.000]   What were the things you asked
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000]   that be changed in that letter?
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:39.000]   - Yeah, so the top three things were,
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:44.000]   one, to communicate more with me in particular.
[01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:47.000]   I can probably count on one hand
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:50.000]   the number of times I had a one-on-one phone call
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:53.000]   with Sam, which probably seems insane
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000]   given the position I was supposed to be in.
[01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:58.000]   I basically said, "We have to talk every week."
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000]   It's impossible for me to get anything done
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:01.000]   if I don't have the authority,
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000]   but I have the responsibility
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000]   to be able to push this company forward
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000]   and we're not talking at all.
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000]   So that was number one.
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:13.000]   Number two was to establish
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:20.000]   a separate, especially C-level management staff
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000]   on the U.S. side.
[01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:25.000]   If Sam was going to be so busy doing what he was doing,
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:28.000]   at least he needed to delegate that responsibility
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000]   to a set of professional managers
[01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:31.000]   who could actually take care
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000]   of the day-to-day operations within the company.
[01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000]   And it felt like things were starting to unravel
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000]   in the absence of that.
[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:42.000]   And then the third was to grow the tech team
[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000]   and move a lot of the authority
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:47.000]   and management of that team away from Nishat and Gary
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:50.000]   so that we could actually spread the knowledge
[01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:53.000]   and be able to keep up with a lot of the tasks
[01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000]   that we were assigning ourselves
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000]   and trying to build all these new business lines.
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000]   That pretty much summarizes it.
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000]   - Yeah, how regularly were you talking?
[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000]   - I mean, it wasn't regular.
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:07.000]   I mean, I was on chat groups that he was in.
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:11.000]   And so, you know, occasionally he would respond
[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000]   to something I say on that group.
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:16.000]   But one-on-one conversations,
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:19.000]   I think there were fewer than 10 for my entire tenure.
[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:20.000]   - Wow, okay.
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000]   And that was over a year, right?
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:23.000]   - A year and a half.
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:24.000]   - A year and a half, five.
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:27.000]   So about like less than one every two months.
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:28.000]   - Yeah.
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000]   - How did he respond to this letter?
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:34.000]   - So it took a little while before we got on the phone
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:40.000]   and he went through every point and refuted everyone.
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:43.000]   Starting with communication, he said,
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:46.000]   "I think phone calls are a waste of time.
[01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:49.000]   "I think that if I promise people regular phone calls,
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000]   "they will use it to waste my time
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000]   "and it's not an efficient mode of communication."
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:56.000]   He said, "I think we have the best developer team
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:57.000]   "in the world.
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000]   "And I think anyone who suggests otherwise
[01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:00.000]   "is completely wrong.
[01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:04.000]   "And if we add a lot more people to the dev team,
[01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:05.000]   "if we move them to the U.S.
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000]   "and move them away from the Bahamas,
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000]   "we're going to be worse as an organization."
[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:12.000]   He kind of ignored the point about separate leadership.
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:15.000]   I think he hated the idea of giving other people
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000]   kind of titles that would reflect
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:20.000]   kind of greater responsibility within the company.
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:24.000]   And then, so that conversation ended with us
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000]   kind of not knowing what the future was going to be
[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:27.000]   because I basically said like,
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000]   "Look, I'm going to resign if you don't fix this."
[01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000]   He said, "We're not fixing anything."
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:36.000]   And then what happened next was he had deputized
[01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:39.000]   another person within the company
[01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:42.000]   to come here to Chicago
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:46.000]   and pull me into a side room and say,
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000]   "You are probably going to be fired
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000]   "for this letter that you wrote.
[01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000]   "And not only are you going to be fired,
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:56.000]   "but Sam is going to destroy your professional reputation.
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:59.000]   "Like where do you think you're going to be able to work
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:02.000]   "after FTX, after all this happened?"
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:05.000]   And he was threatening me.
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:09.000]   And then not only that, he had said,
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:13.000]   "If you are going to have any hope of staying
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:16.000]   "and if you can forget about getting paid bonuses,
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000]   "you need to write Sam an apology letter
[01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000]   "and show it to me first 'cause I'm going to edit it.
[01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000]   "And I'm going to tell you what to say."
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:26.000]   And I said, "Absolutely not.
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000]   "This isn't like a mafia organization.
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:31.000]   "This is extremely unprofessional."
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000]   And I knew at that point,
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:36.000]   there was absolutely no way I was staying.
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:39.000]   And it was a matter of when, not if.
[01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:43.000]   But what I did know was that I'm still a professional.
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:44.000]   I'm still loyal to the company.
[01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000]   I still believe the company itself
[01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:50.000]   had an incredible potential to continue
[01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000]   its road of profitability.
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:55.000]   And I really liked all my employees here on the U.S. side
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000]   and I wasn't going to abandon them.
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:00.000]   So I sort of thought a three to six month time period
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000]   is about standard to take the time
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000]   to unwind responsibilities,
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:07.000]   to finish the stocks platform that I was working on,
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:11.000]   to get my team in a position
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000]   where I knew they would be in good standing
[01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:16.000]   and they wouldn't be retaliated against after I left
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:20.000]   and took the time to do that before officially resigning
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:24.000]   in kind of the end of the summer and early fall.
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000]   - And did that happen?
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000]   Like, after you left,
[01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:33.000]   did he try to injure your professional reputation?
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:34.000]   - He did.
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:38.000]   The acute thing that happened was,
[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:42.000]   to Sam, I actually offered to stay on longer.
[01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000]   I said, "I could stay on for a couple more months
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:47.000]   "and help this transition to whomever you name
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:50.000]   "as the successor president of FTX U.S."
[01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:53.000]   And he said, "No, I want you gone more quickly."
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000]   And so I should say he said that,
[01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000]   but he was communicating through other people.
[01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:00.000]   He wasn't talking to me directly at that point.
[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:03.000]   And so he said, "I want you gone on September 27th."
[01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000]   I said, "Okay, that's fine with me."
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:06.000]   On September 27th,
[01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:11.000]   not only did he announce to the company my resignation,
[01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:14.000]   he also announced that he was closing the Chicago
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000]   and San Francisco offices
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:19.000]   and that everyone had to move to Miami.
[01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000]   And basically, if they didn't move to Miami
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:22.000]   by a certain date,
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:25.000]   they were not gonna be at the company anymore.
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:30.000]   So the employees were distraught.
[01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:34.000]   And what I had learned later from several investors
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000]   and reporters who had talked to me
[01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:39.000]   was that when they talked to Sam about my leaving,
[01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:43.000]   Sam told them that my leaving
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:47.000]   was a combination of resignation and firing,
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:51.000]   and that one of the reasons that I had to leave
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:55.000]   was because I refused to move my family to Miami.
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:58.000]   So basically, that guy was constructively fired,
[01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:01.000]   that he had closed down this office that I had built,
[01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000]   and that if I wasn't gonna move,
[01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000]   that I had no role left at the company.
[01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:08.000]   And so that took a little bit to crawl out from.
[01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:11.000]   I had to tell people, "Well, it's completely false.
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000]   "It didn't happen at all."
[01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:16.000]   And yeah, he was telling people that he fired me.
[01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000]   - And when he said that,
[01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:22.000]   he was still at a sort of peak of hype, so to speak, right?
[01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:23.000]   - Absolutely.
[01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:26.000]   - So, I mean, did the idea of forming Architect
[01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:29.000]   have already, you already had that idea by this point?
[01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000]   - Yeah, knowing that I was gonna leave,
[01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000]   I started thinking what I was gonna do next
[01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000]   and thought, "Well, if I think I can run a company
[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000]   "better than Sam, I should put my money where my mouth is
[01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:38.000]   "and start a company."
[01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:41.000]   But I had this, you know, a couple of ideas,
[01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000]   and I had this particular idea for Architect,
[01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:44.000]   and it was starting to really form
[01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:47.000]   kind of towards the end of my time at FTX,
[01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000]   but I hadn't started anything.
[01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000]   And so finally, like, I left FTX
[01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000]   and then took a little bit of time off
[01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000]   and then started to talk to investors
[01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:58.000]   about, you know, maybe raising some money
[01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000]   for starting this company.
[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:03.000]   And there were a few investors that basically said, like,
[01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:06.000]   you know, "Do you have Sam's blessing to do this?
[01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000]   "Why do I need Sam's blessing?
[01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000]   "I've resigned, I don't work there anymore."
[01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:13.000]   And they said, like, "We really would feel more comfortable
[01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000]   "if we could talk to Sam first
[01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:18.000]   "and kind of, like, you know, make sure things are okay
[01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000]   "and kind of figure out what he's doing,
[01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000]   "find out if he wants to invest too
[01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000]   "before we kind of talk to you further."
[01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:27.000]   And it was impossible to escape that, like,
[01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:32.000]   the Sam kind of hype bubble, even having left the company.
[01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:35.000]   - Why do you think they were so concerned about,
[01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:38.000]   let's say, like, trying to invest in FTX in the future?
[01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000]   - They were existing FTX investors.
[01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000]   And I think it really mattered to them
[01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000]   what Sam thought of them.
[01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000]   And if they didn't know the full story
[01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:49.000]   and if they were being told that, like, Sam fired me,
[01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:52.000]   then I think they were concerned about, you know,
[01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000]   potential conflict investing in me too.
[01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:58.000]   - Was any part of that because Sam had a reputation as,
[01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000]   I don't know, if, like, an investor invested
[01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:03.000]   in somebody he disapproved of, he would get upset in some way?
[01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000]   - Well, if that happened, I don't know about it,
[01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:11.000]   but I think it was just Sam had such a kind of magical hold
[01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:15.000]   over the entire industry, from investors to media
[01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:20.000]   to politicians, that they looked to him for approval.
[01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:21.000]   - Okay, yeah.
[01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:25.000]   So at this point, you've left FTX US
[01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:30.000]   and you're starting to work on your own company.
[01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000]   And when is this exactly?
[01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:33.000]   This is...
[01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000]   - So I left at the end of, well,
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000]   my official resignation was the end of September.
[01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:40.000]   I had, like, stopped working earlier than that.
[01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000]   And so I kind of started to start working
[01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000]   on fundraising for the company in October.
[01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:48.000]   - And then a month later, the thing implodes.
[01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:52.000]   So when did you hear the first inkling
[01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:56.000]   that there might be some potential trouble?
[01:45:56.000 --> 01:46:02.000]   - The first thing I heard was the night before
[01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:07.000]   the announcement that Binance might be buying FTX.
[01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000]   I was just looking at Twitter
[01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:12.000]   and just saw all of this fear-mongering.
[01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:16.000]   It was like, okay, well, CZ says he's selling FTT,
[01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:17.000]   and so FTT's going to go down.
[01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:20.000]   And people were saying, well, that means Alameda's toast.
[01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000]   And then once Alameda goes under,
[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:25.000]   oh, that's going to be a problem for FTX,
[01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000]   pull your funds from FTX.
[01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000]   And I was just sort of laughing at this
[01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000]   because, like, whatever, I'm used to people
[01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:34.000]   saying things on Twitter that seem nonsensical.
[01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:40.000]   And first of all, Sam and Caroline are great traders.
[01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000]   Like, if anything, maybe they'll profit
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000]   from all this volatility and tokens.
[01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:47.000]   And they don't understand, like, there's no way
[01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:48.000]   anything's going to happen to Alameda.
[01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:53.000]   But also, this connection between the price of FTT token
[01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:57.000]   and the ability for customers to withdraw their funds
[01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000]   from the exchange, like, this just did not compute
[01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:00.000]   for me at all.
[01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000]   So I was like, well, you know, this will boil over
[01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:05.000]   in a couple of days like everything else.
[01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:10.000]   And the next morning, you know, I was actually busy
[01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:13.000]   talking to, like, my own lawyers and investors
[01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000]   for the company because we were actually closing up
[01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000]   our investment round.
[01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:20.000]   Actually, the closing docks for my investment round
[01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:25.000]   went out that morning, the morning that FTX announced
[01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:26.000]   they were going to be bought by Binance.
[01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:31.000]   It was, like, the worst timing in crypto fundraising history.
[01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:35.000]   And so I was busy all morning and then I went, you know,
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:39.000]   online and checked Twitter and then saw Sam's tweet
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000]   that said, you know, like, what comes around goes around
[01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:45.000]   and we're going to get acquired by Binance.
[01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000]   And I don't know, I felt dizzy.
[01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:52.000]   I had no idea what was going on in the world at FTX.
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:55.000]   I just couldn't put the pieces together in my head.
[01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000]   It just didn't make any sense to me.
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:03.000]   So before then, like, you did not think this was possible.
[01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:07.000]   I mean, I kept a bunch of money on the exchange.
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:12.000]   I was still an equity holder in FTX and FTX US.
[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:17.000]   Like, I was still very, very pro FTX in spite of my, you know,
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:18.000]   experience with Sam.
[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:21.000]   And then how did that week unfold for you?
[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:24.000]   You were, I guess, almost about to close your round.
[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:27.000]   What happened to the round and then how were you processing
[01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:28.000]   the information?
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000]   I mean, it was, like, a crazy week on Twitter, right?
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:31.000]   Yeah.
[01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000]   The deal falls apart.
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000]   There's, like, bankruptcy, hacking.
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:38.000]   Anyways, tell me about that week for you.
[01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:39.000]   Sure.
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:43.000]   So, I mean, first, the investors, you know, we all had to hit pause.
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:46.000]   I mean, first of all, Architect became, you know, priority number
[01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000]   1,000 on everyone's list.
[01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:54.000]   Secondly, a number of those investors were trying to do damage
[01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:55.000]   control themselves.
[01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:59.000]   You know, either they were themselves investors in FTX or FTT.
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:05.000]   They had companies who part of their runway was held on FTX or they
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:08.000]   were expecting to get investment from FTX.
[01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:12.000]   So, people were just trying to assess, like, what was happening
[01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:13.000]   with their own companies.
[01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:16.000]   They were not writing checks into new companies anymore.
[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000]   So, like, I had to hit pause on the whole thing.
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:21.000]   I mean, for their sake and for my sake.
[01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:27.000]   And, yeah, just what could one do in that situation except for just
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:32.000]   read the news all week because everything that came out was something
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:37.000]   brand new and unbelievable, more unfathomable than the thing before.
[01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:42.000]   And it was a mixture of, like, rumors on Twitter and articles coming
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:47.000]   out in, you know, major media publications and the kind of announcement
[01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:48.000]   of the bankruptcy.
[01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000]   It was just information overload.
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:53.000]   And it was very difficult to parse fact from fiction.
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000]   And so, it was an emotional time.
[01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:56.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000]   I understand that, right?
[01:49:58.000 --> 01:49:59.000]   All right.
[01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:04.000]   So, we've kind of done the whole story of you joining to the company
[01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:05.000]   collapsing.
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:11.000]   I want to do a sort of, like, overview of, I guess, like, what exactly
[01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:15.000]   was happening that caused the company to collapse and, I guess, the
[01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:16.000]   lessons there, right?
[01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:17.000]   So, okay.
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:22.000]   So, in the aftermath, SBF has been saying that FTX US is fully solvent.
[01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:25.000]   They wanted to -- they could start processing withdrawals.
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:30.000]   He had a soft stack recently in January where he said that it had $400
[01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:33.000]   million more in assets than liabilities.
[01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:37.000]   What is your understanding of the sort of relationship between the
[01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000]   solvency of FTX US?
[01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000]   The short answer is I really don't know.
[01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:44.000]   You know, if you had asked me about the solvency of FTX US at the time
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:47.000]   that I left, I would have said, "Why are you asking about this?
[01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000]   Like, of course, everything's fine."
[01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:50.000]   Right.
[01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:54.000]   Now, it's very difficult to understand what is going on.
[01:50:54.000 --> 01:51:04.000]   I mean, first, the level of deception that was, you know, created by
[01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:08.000]   this inner circle of Sam's and now reported through, like, the various
[01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:14.000]   complaints and indictments from DOJ, they were doing things to
[01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:19.000]   intentionally manipulate internal records in order to fool, like, the
[01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000]   employees and auditors and investors.
[01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:24.000]   So everything's out the window at that point.
[01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:30.000]   And then secondly, it sounded like in the week prior to the bankruptcy,
[01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:34.000]   there was this, like, flurry of intercompany transfers.
[01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:38.000]   And given all that that's happened, it's impossible to say what state we
[01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:42.000]   are in now compared to where we were several months prior.
[01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:45.000]   So it's impossible to know.
[01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000]   Who took over management of FTX US when you left?
[01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:48.000]   I'm not sure.
[01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:52.000]   Was it a single individual or was it just rested back to the Bahamas?
[01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:53.000]   I really don't know.
[01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:57.000]   I mean, I'm totally cut off from everything FTX at the time that I left.
[01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:02.000]   Before you left, were the assets of FTX US custodied separately to
[01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:05.000]   FTX International's assets?
[01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:06.000]   Yes, they were.
[01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:07.000]   Okay.
[01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000]   So we had, like, a separate set of bank accounts, a separate set of
[01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000]   crypto wallets.
[01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:14.000]   You know, the exchange itself was, like, a separate database of
[01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:18.000]   customers that ran in, like, a different AWS cloud than the one, you
[01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000]   know, that the international exchange ran on.
[01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:21.000]   Okay.
[01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:22.000]   Got it.
[01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:26.000]   And you had full access to this and, like, it checked out, basically.
[01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000]   More assets and liabilities.
[01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:29.000]   Right.
[01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:33.000]   But remember that the thing that makes them not separate is the fact -- and
[01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:39.000]   this was completely public -- that Sam was the CEO of FTX and FTX US.
[01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:42.000]   And Gary was the CTO of FTX and FTX US.
[01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:45.000]   And Nishad was the Director of Engineering for FTX and FTX US.
[01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:50.000]   And so as long as there wasn't this, like, completely separate walled-off
[01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:55.000]   governance that we were trying to establish while I was there, there was
[01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:58.000]   never going to be perfect separation between the companies.
[01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000]   This was, like, a known problem.
[01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:04.000]   And, you know, that's what makes it so difficult to sort of understand the
[01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:08.000]   nature of what was potentially happening behind the scenes.
[01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:12.000]   So I guess we've been talking about the sort of management organizational
[01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000]   issues of FTX.
[01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:20.000]   Were these themselves not, like, some red flag to you that, I don't know,
[01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000]   something really weird could be happening here?
[01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000]   Even if it wasn't, like, fraud, right?
[01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:28.000]   Like, these people are responsible for tens of billions of dollars' worth of
[01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:32.000]   assets, and they don't seem that competent, they don't seem to know what
[01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000]   they're doing, they're making these mistakes.
[01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:37.000]   Was that itself not something that, like, concerns you?
[01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:41.000]   I mean, it concerned me, and I tried to raise concerns multiple times.
[01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:45.000]   If you raise concerns multiple times and they don't listen, what can you do
[01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000]   other than, you know, leave?
[01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:52.000]   But you have to understand that every company I've ever worked at, and I
[01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:57.000]   would think any company anyone's ever worked at, has management problems and
[01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:58.000]   growing problems.
[01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:06.000]   And especially for a super high-growth startup like FTX, it's a very natural
[01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:11.000]   progression to have the visionary CEO who brings that product to product
[01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:18.000]   market fit, who enjoys that sort of explosive success, and then the reins of
[01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:23.000]   the company are eventually handed over to professional managers who sort of take
[01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:26.000]   it into its maturation phase.
[01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:30.000]   And I thought, well, really, I'm not that person because, you know, Sam and I
[01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:36.000]   have interpersonal issues, but there's 100-plus major investors in FTX.
[01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:40.000]   Someone will figure out how to install the correct management of this company
[01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000]   over time and will bring it to a good place.
[01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000]   Like, one way or another, this is going to succeed.
[01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:47.000]   There are too many people with vested interests in doing so.
[01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:53.000]   And so, no, I wasn't concerned that, you know, FTX wouldn't somehow figure
[01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:54.000]   this out.
[01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:57.000]   I still thought FTX had an extremely bright future.
[01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:02.000]   But there might be, I guess, these sorts of visionaries.
[01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:06.000]   A lot of them might have, like, you know, problems, to put it in that kind of
[01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:07.000]   language.
[01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:08.000]   But I don't know.
[01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:11.000]   I don't know how many of them would make you suspect that there's, like, mental
[01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:14.000]   health issues or there's addiction issues.
[01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:17.000]   That, for somebody who's in charge of a multi-billion-dollar empire, I don't
[01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:20.000]   know, it seems like something that's especially concerning.
[01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:24.000]   I can't quite speak to, like, whether people would think there are, you know,
[01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:28.000]   mental health issues of, like, other, like, you know, people who are supposed to
[01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000]   be the kind of figureheads of large companies.
[01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:34.000]   But remember, like, at this point, Sam is not leading the day-to-day operations
[01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:35.000]   of the company.
[01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:38.000]   Like, many other people are, right?
[01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:43.000]   And as the kind of public figurehead of the company, Sam was obviously doing a
[01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:44.000]   very good job.
[01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000]   He was extremely successful at raising money.
[01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:50.000]   He was extremely successful at building a positive image for the company.
[01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000]   And so, in that sense, that was all going fine.
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:55.000]   And the rest of the company was being run by other people.
[01:55:55.000 --> 01:56:00.000]   So, you know, I didn't witness anything like, you know, the addiction stuff
[01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:01.000]   firsthand.
[01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:04.000]   I definitely thought he was not as happy a person as I met, you know, a long time
[01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:05.000]   ago.
[01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:10.000]   But could you blame a person for, you know, inheriting a 20, 30-billion-dollar
[01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:14.000]   company and, you know, not taking it super well when you're 29 years old?
[01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:15.000]   I think so.
[01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:19.000]   I mean, you mentioned that, like, given the fact that hundreds of accredited
[01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:23.000]   investors presumably had done good due diligence, that, you know, that, like,
[01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:27.000]   gave you some comfort about the ultimate, I guess, soundness of the company.
[01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:34.000]   But potentially, those hundreds of investors are relying on the experienced
[01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:38.000]   high-level executives that SPF had brought on that is thinking that, listen, if
[01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:43.000]   somebody from Citadel and Jane Street is working at FTX, that's a good indication
[01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000]   that, you know, they're doing a good job.
[01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:52.000]   And so, in some implicit way, you're lending your credibility to FTX, right?
[01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:58.000]   And so, I guess, was there just this sort of circle of trust where the investors
[01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:03.000]   are assuming if this person who has tons of leadership experience in traditional
[01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:06.000]   finance is coming to FTX, they must have done the due diligence themselves.
[01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:09.000]   And then you are assuming that the investors have done this.
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:13.000]   And then so it's, like, nobody's role to be the, you know, the guy who's like,
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:16.000]   "This was my job, and I was the person in charge of it."
[01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:21.000]   Remember, regardless of how experienced or inexperienced people in the company
[01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:25.000]   are, regardless of how many or few investors there are, how many senior
[01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:32.000]   lateral hires there are, if a very small group of individuals who are very smart
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:42.000]   and very capable intentionally put forth schemes that deceive people within the
[01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:49.000]   company and outside the company about the veracity of records, what can you do?
[01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:52.000]   What is one supposed to do in that situation?
[01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:58.000]   If the public reporting matches private reporting, if investors have done their
[01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:02.000]   own diligence, if we've, you know, joined the company and we see nothing wrong
[01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:06.000]   within the company from a financial perspective, if we can see the public
[01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:12.000]   volume on the exchange and it all, like, matches up with our internal reporting
[01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:15.000]   and we know how much fees we'll be able to collect and all that, and it seems
[01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:20.000]   like a lot of income compared to our expenses for a 200- or 300-person company,
[01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:26.000]   at what point do you, like, go against all of that and say, "In spite of the
[01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:29.000]   overwhelming evidence to the contrary, I think something is wrong"?
[01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:30.000]   Yeah.
[01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:33.000]   But someone might look at this and say, "Listen, Brett, you weren't, like,
[01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:38.000]   a junior trader who was, like, right out of MIT or something who just joined FTX.
[01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:42.000]   You have more than 10 years of experience in finance.
[01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000]   You, like, saw Lehman happen.
[01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:48.000]   You, you know, you've, like, managed really large teams in TradFi.
[01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:52.000]   And then you have the skills and the experience, and if somebody with your
[01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:57.000]   skills and experience and not only that, your position in FTX as president of FTX
[01:58:57.000 --> 01:59:03.000]   US, if you can't see it coming and maybe you couldn't, right, whose job was it
[01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:04.000]   to see it coming?
[01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:08.000]   Like, it doesn't seem that anybody other than the inner circle could have been
[01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:11.000]   in a better position, and maybe nobody could have seen it, but, like, is there
[01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:14.000]   somebody who outside of the inner circle you think should have been able to see
[01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000]   it coming?
[01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:17.000]   I don't know.
[01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:23.000]   It's a good question of, like, when a major fraud happens in such a way where
[01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:30.000]   it was, you know, very expertly crafted to be hidden from the people who could
[01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:34.000]   have done something about it, what should one do?
[01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:38.000]   I mean, one answer is never trust anyone, right?
[01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:43.000]   Like, every company I ever work for in the future, every time, like, we say
[01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:47.000]   we've, like, done some transaction, I will ask them to show me the bank records
[01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:51.000]   and, like, give me the, you know, the number of the bank teller I can call to
[01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:54.000]   have them, like, independently verify every single banking transaction.
[01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:57.000]   I mean, this is sort of, like, impractical and ridiculous.
[01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000]   It just, like, it doesn't happen.
[01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:04.000]   And so I think, like, it sounds like the counterfactual here is one where,
[02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:10.000]   okay, first I have to believe that there is some kind of fraud, which I don't.
[02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:17.000]   Then I have to say, okay, I would like to start auditing all bank transactions.
[02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:20.000]   Oh, actually, I want to start auditing all bank transactions for the company
[02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000]   that I don't work for.
[02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:28.000]   Also, I want to, like, disbelieve audited financials from respective
[02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000]   third-party auditors.
[02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:36.000]   I also want to look into the possibility that Sam is, like, lying under oath
[02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:40.000]   in congressional hearings about segregation of customer funds.
[02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:43.000]   Also, I should disbelieve all of the trusted media outlets and also
[02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:46.000]   100 financial institutions that have invested in FTX.
[02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:51.000]   It's like the chain that you have to go through in order to get to a point
[02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:58.000]   where you start to be able to figure out something is wrong is, I think,
[02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000]   really impossible.
[02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:08.000]   And I think the bottom line is there, you know, for sure should be mandated,
[02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:15.000]   you know, at certain stages of company growth, independent boards.
[02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:21.000]   And I think that a lot of that has to do with, like, where the, like,
[02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:24.000]   nexus of control of the company really is and making sure it's in a place
[02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:28.000]   where there is appropriate regulatory oversight and appropriate
[02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000]   financial oversight.
[02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000]   I think that maybe could have helped.
[02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:37.000]   But besides that, I think this is ultimately a job for enforcement.
[02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.000]   Like, people will commit crimes.
[02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:42.000]   And there's nothing one can do to stop all people from committing all
[02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:43.000]   possible future crimes.
[02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:47.000]   What one can do is come up with the right structures and incentives so that
[02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:52.000]   we can build, like, a trust-based system where people can innovate and build
[02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:56.000]   great companies and people who are bad actors can get flushed out,
[02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000]   which is ultimately what I think is happening.
[02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:01.000]   But I guess they're not letting you hire people.
[02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:05.000]   They're, like, overseeing writing the actual code for FTX from the Bahamas.
[02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:08.000]   Not something that makes you think, like, why are they doing this?
[02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:09.000]   You know, it's, like, a little odd.
[02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:13.000]   I just thought it was not the right way to run the company.
[02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:17.000]   There's a very large chasm between I don't think they're doing a good job
[02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:22.000]   running the company and I think that customer funds are at risk, right?
[02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000]   Yeah, fair enough.
[02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:30.000]   What should someone who sees bad organizational practices, there's no board,
[02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:35.000]   they're making a ton of really weird investments and acquisitions.
[02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:39.000]   And not only that, like, most importantly, they are responsible for
[02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:43.000]   managing tens of billions of dollars' worth of other people's assets.
[02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:47.000]   What should somebody do when they're seeing all this happening?
[02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:52.000]   I mean, obviously, it's, like, very admirable that you put this in, like,
[02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:56.000]   writing to him, you gave it to him, and then you resigned when he refused
[02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:57.000]   to abide by it.
[02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:01.000]   But, so maybe the answer is just that, but, like, is there something else
[02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:02.000]   that somebody should do?
[02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:07.000]   I would say within any company, and I would expect that, like,
[02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:11.000]   the overwhelming majority of companies, if you see bad management,
[02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000]   it does not imply fraud.
[02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:17.000]   But there's lots of places with bad workplace culture and people are making
[02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000]   bad management decisions.
[02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:23.000]   And it should be that if you're in, find yourself in that position,
[02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:26.000]   there is someone you can go to to talk to.
[02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:27.000]   It might be your manager.
[02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000]   It might be your manager's manager.
[02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:32.000]   It could be someone in your HR department.
[02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:36.000]   But there should be, like, a designated person within the company for you
[02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:41.000]   as an employee that you know you have a safe space to bring complaints
[02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:45.000]   about the workplace and about the company strategy.
[02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000]   And then you should see how they handle it.
[02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:50.000]   You know, do they take it seriously?
[02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:51.000]   Do they make changes?
[02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.000]   Do they look into the stuff you're talking about?
[02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:57.000]   Do they encourage, you know, cooperative, positive discussion?
[02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000]   Do they threaten you?
[02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:02.000]   Do they retaliate against you in some way?
[02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000]   Do they start excluding you from conversations?
[02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000]   Do they, you know, threaten to withhold pay?
[02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:10.000]   Like, if you're in that latter camp, what do you do at that point?
[02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:14.000]   It's easy for me to say, and I've been in sort of fortunate positions
[02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:17.000]   within companies and have, you know, personal flexibility.
[02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000]   It might not be so easy for the average person to sort of get up
[02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.000]   and leave a job.
[02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:25.000]   But I do think that at some point you have to start making plans.
[02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:28.000]   Because, like, what can you do in the face of a giant organization
[02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:32.000]   that you disagree with other than leave?
[02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:36.000]   Let's talk about regulators and your relationship with them
[02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000]   while you were at FTX.
[02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:41.000]   I mean, obviously, as head of FTX US, I imagine you were heavily involved
[02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.000]   with talking to them.
[02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:48.000]   What was their attitude towards FTX like before it fell?
[02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:51.000]   All of the regulators were, I think, in the common belief
[02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:56.000]   that crypto was a large and viable asset class.
[02:04:56.000 --> 02:05:01.000]   And in order for it to grow in a responsible way,
[02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:05.000]   it needs to come within the regulatory envelopes that already exist.
[02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000]   In whatever way that's appropriate for crypto.
[02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000]   And crypto can mean a lot of different things.
[02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.000]   We have to maybe distinguish between centralized
[02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.000]   and decentralized finance here.
[02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:20.000]   I would say regulators saw FTX as at least one of the companies
[02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:25.000]   that was very willing to work directly and collaboratively
[02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:29.000]   with regulators as opposed to trying to kind of skirt around
[02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000]   the regulatory system.
[02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.000]   Well, when I was preparing to interview SPF, actually,
[02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:36.000]   I got a chance to learn about your proposal to the CFTC.
[02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000]   We were just talking about it.
[02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000]   You were explaining this earlier, but the auto liquidation
[02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:44.000]   budgeting system bring that not only to crypto in the U.S.,
[02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:47.000]   but to derivatives for stocks and other assets.
[02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:50.000]   I thought, and I still think it's a good idea,
[02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:53.000]   but do you think there's any potential for that now,
[02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:57.000]   given that the company most associated with that has been blown up?
[02:05:57.000 --> 02:06:01.000]   What is the future of that innovation to the financial system look like?
[02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:04.000]   Yeah, I definitely think it's been set back.
[02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000]   You know, it's interesting.
[02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:10.000]   Walt Lueken from the Futures Industry Association in a conference
[02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:14.000]   that was shortly after the class of FTX, you know,
[02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:18.000]   talked about FTX and sort of a speech, but specifically made a call
[02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:22.000]   to the fact that in spite of what happened to FTX,
[02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:28.000]   the idea of building a future system that can evolve
[02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:34.000]   with a 24/7 world is still a worthwhile endeavor
[02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:37.000]   and something that we should consider and pursue and be ready for.
[02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:41.000]   We are 3D printing organs and coming up with specially designed
[02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:46.000]   mRNA vaccines, but you still can't get a margin call on a Saturday
[02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:49.000]   for an S&P 500 future.
[02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:53.000]   There's some real lack of evolution in market structure
[02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:56.000]   in a number of areas of traditional finance,
[02:06:56.000 --> 02:07:00.000]   and I think it's still a worthwhile endeavor to pursue it.
[02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:05.000]   I think the Ledger X proposal makes a lot of sense.
[02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:08.000]   I think it's understandable where some of the concerns were
[02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:11.000]   around how that could really dramatically alter the landscape
[02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:16.000]   for derivatives, regulatory structure, and market structure.
[02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:19.000]   And there were still unaddressed questions there,
[02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:22.000]   but I still think that it was the right idea.
[02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:26.000]   During those hearings, I guess the establishment, you know,
[02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:29.000]   CME and others brought up criticisms like,
[02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:32.000]   "Oh, we have these sort of physical relationships with our clients,
[02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:35.000]   and if you just have this algorithm take its place,
[02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:39.000]   you can have these liquidation cascades where illiquid assets,
[02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:43.000]   you know, they start getting sold, that drives their price even lower,
[02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:46.000]   which causes more liquidations from this algorithm,
[02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:49.000]   and you have this sort of cascade where the bottom falls out."
[02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:53.000]   And even though this might not be an accurate way to describe
[02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:56.000]   what happened with FTT and FTX, because there was, like,
[02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:59.000]   a lot more going on, do you think that they maybe had a point
[02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:02.000]   given how FTX is played out?
[02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:07.000]   A lot of FCMs have auto-liquidation.
[02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:10.000]   There is one particular one where, like,
[02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:13.000]   they actually automatically close you every day at 4 p.m.,
[02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.000]   and they do it, like, in a really bad way.
[02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:19.000]   So, like, the idea of auto-liquidation is not new.
[02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:25.000]   The idea of direct-to-customer clearing is not new.
[02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:29.000]   The idea of cross-collateralization is not new.
[02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:32.000]   The thing I think that was novel about FTX
[02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:35.000]   was putting it all together.
[02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:38.000]   It was direct-to-customer, margining, cross-collateralization,
[02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000]   auto-liquidation.
[02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:46.000]   And so in order for the regulators to get comfortable
[02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:49.000]   with the application, they had to understand that FTX
[02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:53.000]   as one entity was performing the roles that typically
[02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:55.000]   multiple different entities perform.
[02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:58.000]   And you always need to ask yourself the question of, like,
[02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:01.000]   was there something worthwhile about having those different
[02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000]   entities be separate or not?
[02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:07.000]   Is it just sort of, like, legacy regulatory structure?
[02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000]   I think that remains to be seen.
[02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:12.000]   I think we don't have enough, you know, experience,
[02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000]   especially in the U.S., with that kind of model
[02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:17.000]   to be able to say whether it actually works better or worse.
[02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:20.000]   I think either way, it was worth a try.
[02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:23.000]   And I think maybe the biggest misconception about the
[02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:26.000]   application was that, you know, if we got approved,
[02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:29.000]   it meant suddenly FTX is going to list, like, everything
[02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:33.000]   from, like, corn to soybeans to oil to S&P 500 overnight
[02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:36.000]   and completely, you know, destroy the existing derivatives landscape.
[02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:39.000]   I think what would have actually happened was FTX would have
[02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:43.000]   gotten permission to list, like, one contract on kind of
[02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:47.000]   small size, and there would have been, you know, experience
[02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:50.000]   with the platform, and it would have, like, you know,
[02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:53.000]   been assessed compared to the alternatives on traditional
[02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:56.000]   CCPs, and if it was worse, changes would have been made,
[02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000]   and if it was better, it would evolve, and the market
[02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:01.000]   would basically decide what people wanted to trade on.
[02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:04.000]   I do think, like, the auto-liquidation part was the
[02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:07.000]   main piece that people were hung up on, which was, like,
[02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:11.000]   how do you provably show the kind of worst-case scenario
[02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:14.000]   in an auto-liquidation cascade?
[02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:18.000]   Then again, on large CCPs now in the U.S. and Europe,
[02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:21.000]   there are margin breaches all the time.
[02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:24.000]   So, like, the current system is far from perfect.
[02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:27.000]   Backing up to, I guess, regulation more generally,
[02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:30.000]   I mean, many people saw crypto as a sort of regulatory
[02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:33.000]   arbitrage where, because regulations are so broken
[02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:37.000]   in finance, I guess evidence would be that you're not
[02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.000]   allowed to do this manually, right? You had to go through
[02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:42.000]   this lengthy approval process if you're a giant company
[02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:45.000]   to begin with. The entire point of crypto was to get
[02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:48.000]   around the regulators and not go through them to get
[02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:51.000]   approval for things and hand over that kind of approval
[02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:54.000]   process to them. Do you think that working with the
[02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:57.000]   regulators and then also being part of crypto was a sort
[02:10:57.000 --> 02:11:00.000]   of, like, it kind of defeated the point of crypto?
[02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000]   I think I disagree with the premise. Like, I don't think
[02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000]   the point of crypto is regulatory arbitrage.
[02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:10.000]   I think that while crypto remains unregulated,
[02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:13.000]   it is easier to get something done in crypto than if
[02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:16.000]   it were regulated. That's sort of, like, tautological.
[02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:19.000]   I also think that most people, especially on the
[02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:22.000]   institutional side who trade crypto, believe that we
[02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:26.000]   are in a temporary state that cannot last forever,
[02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:30.000]   which is that crypto is largely unregulated or has
[02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:34.000]   a weird patchwork of regulatory authority.
[02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000]   Maybe it's, like, the 50 state regulators in the U.S.
[02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:41.000]   or it's some combination of, like, money transfer and
[02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:45.000]   CFD or broker-dealer activity in Europe.
[02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:49.000]   So I think it's absolutely a worthwhile endeavor
[02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000]   knowing that there's going to be some regulation for
[02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:54.000]   at least part of the crypto ecosystem to work with
[02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000]   regulators to make sure that it's done well.
[02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000]   One very important question about the whole FTX thing
[02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:01.000]   is, like, what did the conventional narrative about
[02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000]   how it went down and why it went down,
[02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:07.000]   what did it get wrong, given that you were on the inside?
[02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.000]   Like, what do you know was different than
[02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:11.000]   what has been reported?
[02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:14.000]   I actually think not much.
[02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:18.000]   And I think the reason for that is, you know, typically
[02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000]   when something like this goes wrong and it becomes
[02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:23.000]   this media frenzy, there's, like, plenty of opportunity
[02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:26.000]   for misinformation to spread.
[02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:30.000]   But to the credit of the investigators working on this
[02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:34.000]   case, they moved so quickly that, you know, they had
[02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:37.000]   unsealed indictments within, what, two months
[02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:39.000]   of this going down.
[02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:44.000]   And so having kind of a lot of the truth, you know,
[02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:48.000]   being able to be spelled out in facts in a public
[02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:52.000]   written document, I think, quelled a lot of the
[02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:55.000]   opportunity for misinformation to proliferate.
[02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:58.000]   And whether that's from, like, a Twitter troll or
[02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:01.000]   if it's from Sam Beckman Freed himself, you know,
[02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.000]   trying to, like, spread misinformation about
[02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.000]   what happened, I think a lot of it wasn't really
[02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:07.000]   given the room to breathe.
[02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:10.000]   What did you make of his press tour in the aftermath?
[02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000]   Like, why did he do it?
[02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000]   And, like, yeah, what was your impression of it?
[02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000]   I'm not going to really speculate what's inside
[02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000]   Sam's head.
[02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:26.000]   But I think Sam had built up his empire through
[02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:30.000]   partly his control over media.
[02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:34.000]   And he did that by being available all the time
[02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:37.000]   and being, you know, ostensibly open and honest
[02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:40.000]   with them all the time and probably thought, why
[02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:43.000]   can't the same strategy work now?
[02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:45.000]   And maybe I can sway public opinion.
[02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:48.000]   If I can sway public opinion, maybe I can sway,
[02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:52.000]   you know, regulators and law enforcement.
[02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:55.000]   And it turns out that is definitely not true.
[02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:56.000]   So I don't really know.
[02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:59.000]   It could just be an addiction to the media.
[02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:01.000]   He couldn't stand people talking about him and
[02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:03.000]   him not being part of the conversation.
[02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:04.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:08.000]   And I guess the earlier account you gave of his
[02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:12.000]   day-long media cycle kind of lends credence to
[02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000]   that mentality.
[02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000]   I have a question about the future of the people
[02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000]   who were at FTX.
[02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:23.000]   There's many different organizations who have
[02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:27.000]   had their alumni go on to have really incredible
[02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:29.000]   careers in technology.
[02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:32.000]   Famously, PayPal had a mafia, so-called mafia,
[02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000]   where they went on to found YouTube with Elon
[02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:37.000]   Musk, you know, SpaceX, Tesla.
[02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:38.000]   So many other companies came out of the people
[02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:39.000]   who came out of PayPal.
[02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:42.000]   And Bernd Hobart has this interesting theory.
[02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000]   The reason that happens is when a company exits
[02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:47.000]   too fast, you still have these people who are
[02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000]   young and ambitious in the company who then go
[02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.000]   on to, you know, do powerful things with the
[02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.000]   network and the skills they've accumulated.
[02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:56.000]   Do you think that there will be an FTX mafia?
[02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:59.000]   The number of the, like, most talented people
[02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:04.000]   within FTX are leaving FTX in a slightly
[02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000]   different position than, you know, the people
[02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000]   exiting PayPal in that position.
[02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:11.000]   I would say they're in positions more like
[02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:15.000]   actual mafia people.
[02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:18.000]   But, so I'm not sure it's going to be like some
[02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:19.000]   giant, you know, FTX mafia.
[02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:21.000]   But I do think there are, like, a ton of talented
[02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:24.000]   people at FTX who are going to look to do
[02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:25.000]   something with their careers.
[02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:29.000]   And also a lot of those people, you know, came
[02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:31.000]   from very impressive backgrounds prior to FTX.
[02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:33.000]   So I expect them to want to continue to, you
[02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:36.000]   know, get back on track and build something great.
[02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:37.000]   And so I do think you're going to see at least
[02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:40.000]   a couple of people who emerge from this and do
[02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:41.000]   something really great.
[02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:43.000]   That's a good note to close the FTX chapter
[02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:44.000]   of the interview on.
[02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:45.000]   Sure.
[02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:49.000]   Let's talk about Architect, your new company.
[02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:51.000]   Do you want to introduce people to what
[02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:53.000]   Architect is doing and what problem it's solving?
[02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:54.000]   Sure.
[02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:58.000]   So the goal of Architect is to provide a
[02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:01.000]   single unified infrastructure that makes it
[02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:03.000]   really easy for individuals and institutions
[02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:06.000]   to access kind of all corners of the
[02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000]   digital asset ecosystem.
[02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:11.000]   You know, everywhere from individual crypto
[02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:14.000]   spot exchanges that are centralized to DeFi
[02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:18.000]   protocols to qualified custodians and self
[02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000]   custody and everything in between.
[02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:21.000]   Yeah.
[02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:24.000]   I'm not sure I have enough context to
[02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:25.000]   understand all of that.
[02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:29.000]   So I don't know, but a few grade levels below.
[02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:30.000]   Sure.
[02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.000]   So like backing up a very high level.
[02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:35.000]   So let's say you are someone who wants to
[02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:38.000]   trade crypto in some way or, you know,
[02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000]   what do you actually have to do?
[02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000]   So imagine you want to do something
[02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000]   slightly more than just like sign up for
[02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000]   Coinbase and like click the buttons there.
[02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000]   Like let's say you would like to find the
[02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000]   best price across multiple exchanges.
[02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000]   Let's say that you not only want to find
[02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:55.000]   the best price across multiple exchanges,
[02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.000]   you also want to occasionally do borrow
[02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:59.000]   and lending from DeFi.
[02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:02.000]   Maybe not only that, you also want to
[02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:05.000]   like store your assets in like off exchange
[02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:07.000]   custody as much as possible.
[02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:11.000]   Well, aside from doing all that manually
[02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:13.000]   by like opening up all the different tabs
[02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:15.000]   in your browser and like clicking all the
[02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:17.000]   buttons to move assets around and connect
[02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:19.000]   all these different exchanges, you actually
[02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:21.000]   want to build a system that like unifies
[02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:22.000]   all these things.
[02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:25.000]   You have this buy versus build choice.
[02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:29.000]   And the build choice looks like hire like
[02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:31.000]   five to ten software developers and get
[02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:33.000]   them to write code that understands all
[02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:35.000]   the different protocols and different
[02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:38.000]   exchanges, all the idiosyncrasies of them,
[02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000]   that downloads market data, that stores
[02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:43.000]   the market data, that connects to these
[02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.000]   different custodians, that kind of bridges
[02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:46.000]   all these things together and provides
[02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000]   some kind of like user interface that
[02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:49.000]   pulls it all together.
[02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:51.000]   It's a significant amount of work that
[02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.000]   up till now, basically all of these
[02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:55.000]   different companies are just reproducing.
[02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:57.000]   Like they're all solving like the same
[02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:58.000]   problem.
[02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000]   And as a trader, you want to focus your
[02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:03.000]   time on like strategy development and
[02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:06.000]   alpha and monetization and not on like
[02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:09.000]   how do I connect to random exchange.
[02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:12.000]   So the goal of Architect is to build
[02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:15.000]   this sort of like commodity software
[02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:17.000]   that people can then sort of deploy out
[02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:20.000]   of the box that gives them access to all
[02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:21.000]   of these different venues all at the
[02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:22.000]   same time.
[02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:25.000]   And so it sounds like this is a solution
[02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:29.000]   for people with significant levels of
[02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:31.000]   assets and investment in crypto.
[02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:33.000]   I'm assuming it's not for...
[02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:34.000]   So I think that's like the place we
[02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:35.000]   want to start.
[02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:38.000]   But one phenomenon in crypto that I
[02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000]   think is somewhat new and exciting is
[02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:44.000]   the fact that, okay, if you want to get
[02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000]   into like sophisticated equities
[02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000]   trading, well, what do you have to do?
[02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000]   I mean, you usually have to either
[02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:53.000]   establish a broker dealer or get hooked
[02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:56.000]   up to an existing broker.
[02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000]   You need to get market data, which can
[02:18:58.000 --> 02:18:59.000]   be very expensive.
[02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:03.000]   Like the full depth of book feed from
[02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.000]   NASDAQ costs like tens of thousands of
[02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:07.000]   dollars per month.
[02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:08.000]   If you want to compete on latency, you
[02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:10.000]   have to get like a co-located server in
[02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000]   the NASDAQ colo, which is also going to
[02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000]   cost you tens of thousands of dollars
[02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:15.000]   per month.
[02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:16.000]   There's a significant time and money
[02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:19.000]   overhead to doing all this, which is why
[02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:21.000]   it's so hard to compete in that space
[02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:23.000]   against all like the incumbent players.
[02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:26.000]   Whereas in crypto, many of the markets
[02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:29.000]   are just in the cloud, like in Amazon's
[02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:31.000]   cloud or Alibaba's cloud, and you can
[02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:33.000]   just very cheaply and easily spin up
[02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:34.000]   like a server in there for like a
[02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000]   couple of dollars a month and have the
[02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:40.000]   same access as like a big HFT.
[02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:41.000]   All the market data is free.
[02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:43.000]   The order entry is free.
[02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:45.000]   The protocols are usually fairly simple.
[02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:48.000]   Like you can use like, you know, JSON
[02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000]   over a WebSocket as opposed to speaking
[02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:53.000]   like FIX over some, you know, private
[02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:54.000]   line.
[02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:57.000]   As a result, there is this large and
[02:19:57.000 --> 02:19:59.000]   growing class of kind of like
[02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:01.000]   semi-professional individual traders
[02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:03.000]   that have grown, where there are people
[02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:05.000]   who are smart individuals who have like
[02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:08.000]   maybe some wealth amassed, and they want
[02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.000]   to be able to do kind of professional
[02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:11.000]   trading, whether that's like manual
[02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:13.000]   quick trading or like simple algos using
[02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:14.000]   Python or whatever.
[02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000]   And they can do that and experiment
[02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:17.000]   easily because of the open access of
[02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:19.000]   crypto markets.
[02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:22.000]   And so there's a much wider customer
[02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:23.000]   base for something like this, which
[02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:25.000]   includes these kind of like high-powered
[02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:28.000]   individuals in addition to your small,
[02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:29.000]   medium, large hedge funds and prop
[02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:31.000]   shops and different institutions.
[02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:35.000]   And is the goal to, is crypto the
[02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:37.000]   ultimate market you're targeting?
[02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:40.000]   Or are there other asset classes that
[02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000]   you also want to provide the service to?
[02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000]   We're building very general
[02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000]   infrastructure and, you know, we think
[02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:49.000]   crypto is a viable asset class, but it
[02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:51.000]   is one of many.
[02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:53.000]   And our goal is to provide like
[02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.000]   institutional-grade connectivity and
[02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:57.000]   software to anyone who wants to
[02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:59.000]   participate in trading in a, you know,
[02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:01.000]   semi-sophisticated way.
[02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:02.000]   So I think, you know, over time we'll
[02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.000]   want to grow our offering as much as
[02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:05.000]   possible.
[02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:07.000]   Given the fact that, you know, Nasdaq or
[02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:11.000]   whatever already have these barriers, is
[02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:13.000]   it possible for someone to remove those
[02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:15.000]   barriers with a solution like yours?
[02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:18.000]   Or, I mean, I guess like an analogy that
[02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000]   comes to mind is, you know, I guess
[02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000]   nobody before Mark Cubans, whatever
[02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:25.000]   pharmaceutical company, just tried to go
[02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:26.000]   outside the insurance system and
[02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000]   directly sell drugs to people.
[02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:29.000]   Is it possible to do something like
[02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:31.000]   that for Nasdaq?
[02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:32.000]   Well, yeah, you can't like connect to
[02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000]   Nasdaq without, you know, connecting to
[02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:35.000]   Nasdaq.
[02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:36.000]   You can't like not go through a broker
[02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:37.000]   dealer.
[02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:39.000]   But I think that, you know, we could
[02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:41.000]   eventually try to get the appropriate
[02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:44.000]   licensing required to be an
[02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:47.000]   intermediary that is focused on being
[02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:50.000]   like a technology forward, you know,
[02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.000]   interface towards people being able to
[02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.000]   do more program trading.
[02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.000]   And so if the mission of our company
[02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:58.000]   is to like provide better access, I
[02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:00.000]   think we can do so within the existing
[02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:01.000]   system.
[02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:03.000]   I guess this raises a broader question
[02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:05.000]   of if you're initially trying to solve
[02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:08.000]   for the problems that these exchanges
[02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.000]   should natively have solutions to, or
[02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:11.000]   at least some of the problems are the
[02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:12.000]   ones that these exchanges should
[02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:14.000]   natively have solutions to, why haven't
[02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:17.000]   these exchanges built this stuff
[02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:18.000]   already?
[02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:20.000]   I mean, you're a part of one such
[02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:22.000]   exchange and maybe you function better
[02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:23.000]   than the other ones.
[02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:25.000]   But I mean, you know, they're highly
[02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:26.000]   profitable.
[02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:27.000]   They have a bunch of money.
[02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:28.000]   Why haven't they invested in making
[02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:31.000]   their infrastructure really great?
[02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:32.000]   So in many cases, their
[02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:34.000]   infrastructure is very good.
[02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:35.000]   It's more a question of what's the
[02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:37.000]   incentive of the exchange.
[02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:40.000]   And I think if you're, no matter what,
[02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:42.000]   no single exchange is going to have
[02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:44.000]   all the market share.
[02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:45.000]   So there's always going to be this
[02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:48.000]   like market fragmentation problem.
[02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:49.000]   And the question is, whose
[02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:50.000]   responsibility is it to make software
[02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:52.000]   that helps solve that problem?
[02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:56.000]   If I'm some centralized exchange, my
[02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:57.000]   incentive is not to build software to
[02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:59.000]   make it easier for my customers to go
[02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:00.000]   to all the other exchanges.
[02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:02.000]   It's like make my exchange better.
[02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:03.000]   So I'm going to put all of my R&D
[02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:05.000]   dollars into like providing new
[02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:07.000]   products and offering new different
[02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:08.000]   kinds of services and maybe
[02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:11.000]   investment advisory or lowering the
[02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:13.000]   barrier to entry to connect into my
[02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:15.000]   own exchange, but not creating this
[02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:19.000]   sort of like pan asset class, pan
[02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:22.000]   exchange interconnectivity software.
[02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:23.000]   Got it.
[02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:24.000]   Got it.
[02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:27.000]   And given the fact that you're
[02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:28.000]   trying to connect these different
[02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:30.000]   exchanges, I mean, currently most of
[02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000]   the volume in crypto is in centralized
[02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:33.000]   exchanges.
[02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:37.000]   What is your estimate of the
[02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:40.000]   relative trading volume of C5 versus
[02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:41.000]   D5?
[02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:43.000]   Do you think it'll change over time?
[02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:45.000]   So I do think it'll change over
[02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:46.000]   time.
[02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:48.000]   I think my view is I can't predict
[02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:50.000]   what way it's going to change.
[02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:53.000]   So, you know, people after FTX had
[02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:55.000]   asked me like, hey, why don't you
[02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:56.000]   try to start your own exchange?
[02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:57.000]   Like take all your knowledge from
[02:23:57.000 --> 02:24:00.000]   FTX US and, you know, maybe even
[02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:02.000]   like raise money to buy the IP out
[02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:03.000]   of bankruptcy and like start a new
[02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:04.000]   exchange.
[02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:06.000]   And my feeling is I don't want to
[02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:08.000]   bet personally on the exact
[02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:10.000]   direction of crypto trading.
[02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:12.000]   Like I could see it continuing
[02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:14.000]   status quo where like your coin
[02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:16.000]   basis and finances of the world kind
[02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:17.000]   of maintain market share.
[02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:19.000]   I could see it moving significantly
[02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:22.000]   to defy where people feel like this
[02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000]   is the true spirit of crypto.
[02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.000]   It's in this sort of non-custodial
[02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:28.000]   like fully centralized trading
[02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:29.000]   environment.
[02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:30.000]   I could also see it going the
[02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:32.000]   complete opposite direction and
[02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:34.000]   having the existing highly
[02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:36.000]   regulated exchange players like
[02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:40.000]   Naisi and ASDAQ and SIBO like
[02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:42.000]   start to enter the game on spot
[02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:43.000]   trading.
[02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:46.000]   And where is the ultimate flow
[02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.000]   going to end up between these three
[02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:49.000]   possibilities?
[02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:50.000]   I have no idea.
[02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:51.000]   So I'm much more excited about
[02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:53.000]   providing the kind of connectivity
[02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:55.000]   layer to all of them and saying
[02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:56.000]   regardless of where the liquidity
[02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:57.000]   ends up, we'll be able to
[02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:58.000]   facilitate it.
[02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:00.000]   Speaking of FTX, how has your
[02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:02.000]   experience with FTX informed
[02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:03.000]   development of Architect?
[02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:04.000]   Yeah.
[02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.000]   I mean, first of all, working at
[02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.000]   FTX, you know, has given me an
[02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:11.000]   appreciation for just how behind
[02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:13.000]   a lot of the infrastructure is on
[02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:14.000]   other exchanges.
[02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:17.000]   You know, people really like
[02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:18.000]   trading on FTX.
[02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:19.000]   Institutions especially really
[02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:21.000]   like trading on FTX because the
[02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.000]   API made sense.
[02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:25.000]   It really did follow kind of the
[02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:26.000]   kind of standard state machine of
[02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.000]   any kind of financial, you know,
[02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:29.000]   central limit order book that you
[02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:30.000]   would see on a place like NASDAQ
[02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:31.000]   or CME.
[02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:32.000]   Whereas there are a lot of
[02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.000]   exchanges that have crazy
[02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:37.000]   behavior, like you send a cancel
[02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:38.000]   for an order, you get
[02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:39.000]   acknowledged that your order has
[02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:41.000]   been canceled, and then you get a
[02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:42.000]   fill.
[02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.000]   And you actually like get traded
[02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:45.000]   on your thing that you supposedly
[02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:46.000]   thought you canceled.
[02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:47.000]   And like things that you think
[02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:48.000]   shouldn't be possible are
[02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:49.000]   possible.
[02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:51.000]   So actually, my time at FTX is
[02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:52.000]   interesting with relation to
[02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:54.000]   Architect because, you know, FTX,
[02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:56.000]   it gave me an appreciation for
[02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:58.000]   how to design a good API for
[02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:00.000]   especially institutions to want
[02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:02.000]   to be able to trade all the time.
[02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:04.000]   And the protocols in some of these
[02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:06.000]   other exchanges like aren't quite
[02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:07.000]   as good.
[02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:10.000]   So I think it's informed how
[02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:12.000]   much the focus of Architect
[02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:14.000]   should be kind of wrapping up the
[02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:15.000]   complexity of these different
[02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:16.000]   exchanges and providing like a
[02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:18.000]   really good API for institutions
[02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:20.000]   and individuals on our side.
[02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:21.000]   I think that's like thing one.
[02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:24.000]   I think thing two is
[02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:25.000]   obviously with what happened with
[02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:28.000]   FTX, people are much less likely
[02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:31.000]   to trust a centralized institution
[02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:34.000]   with their personal information,
[02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:36.000]   especially things like the keys
[02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:37.000]   that allow you to trade on their
[02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:39.000]   exchange account or the keys that
[02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:41.000]   give you access to their wallet.
[02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:43.000]   And so we're thinking a lot about
[02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:45.000]   how to design Architect such that
[02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.000]   the user can connect to all these
[02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.000]   places and hook up their wallets
[02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:52.000]   without needing to ever give us
[02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:54.000]   any of their private credentials.
[02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:56.000]   And so that's like a particular
[02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:57.000]   inspiration from everything that's
[02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:59.000]   happened in FTX.
[02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:01.000]   What is your opinion of crypto in
[02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:02.000]   general at this point?
[02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.000]   Like how has your sort of
[02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.000]   perception of its promise changed
[02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:09.000]   if at all, given the things?
[02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:11.000]   I mean, I feel the same way now as
[02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:12.000]   I did then, which is it's a, you
[02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:14.000]   know, one to three trillion dollar
[02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:17.000]   asset class that is traded by
[02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.000]   every major institution that is
[02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:21.000]   being invested in by every major
[02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:22.000]   institution.
[02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:25.000]   And so it's totally viable.
[02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:27.000]   And it needs good, mature
[02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:28.000]   infrastructure to support its
[02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:29.000]   growth.
[02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:30.000]   Got it.
[02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:34.000]   But is the motivation also
[02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:37.000]   informed by a view that, I don't
[02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:39.000]   know, crypto is going to be even
[02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:41.000]   bigger or in some way going to
[02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:43.000]   solve really big use cases?
[02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:44.000]   Or is it simply that, like,
[02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:45.000]   listen, this market exists.
[02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:46.000]   I don't know what it's going to
[02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:48.000]   be good for, but it needs this
[02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:49.000]   solution.
[02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:50.000]   It is.
[02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:52.000]   I think, you know, I certainly do
[02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:53.000]   believe that that is like a
[02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:55.000]   likely future for crypto.
[02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:58.000]   But to me, like the interest in
[02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.000]   it starts with knowing that this
[02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:03.000]   is a huge asset class with like
[02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.000]   that needs better infrastructure
[02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:06.000]   for trading it.
[02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:08.000]   And in the aftermath of FTX and
[02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:09.000]   other things, I mean, all
[02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:11.000]   crypto companies have like a
[02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.000]   special scrutiny on them.
[02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.000]   And fairly or unfairly, if
[02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:17.000]   there's like FTX alumni, it'll be
[02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:18.000]   even more so.
[02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:20.000]   Like, how are you convincing
[02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:22.000]   potential clients, investors
[02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:25.000]   that, you know, crypto is safe,
[02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:27.000]   FTX alumni are safe?
[02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:30.000]   Yeah, on the FTX alumni side, I
[02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:31.000]   just personally haven't had
[02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:33.000]   those issues really.
[02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:35.000]   You know, in like recent months
[02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:36.000]   as we've been building out
[02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:38.000]   Architect, you know, I hired
[02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:39.000]   like three, almost five now,
[02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:42.000]   employees from formerly at FTX
[02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:43.000]   to come work with me.
[02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:44.000]   But by the way, is that like
[02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:45.000]   some sort of R basically, that
[02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:47.000]   the overall hiring market is
[02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:48.000]   overcorrected on them or
[02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:49.000]   something?
[02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:50.000]   A hundred percent.
[02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:51.000]   And not just on FTX.
[02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:53.000]   Like right now, like it is, you
[02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:55.000]   know, March 2023 as we're
[02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:56.000]   recording this, like there's
[02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:58.000]   like a huge R in the hiring
[02:28:58.000 --> 02:28:59.000]   market.
[02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:00.000]   I mean, all the layoffs in tech
[02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:02.000]   and crypto, all of like the fear
[02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:04.000]   around various financial
[02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:06.000]   services means that like we
[02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:07.000]   basically didn't need to work
[02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:09.000]   on recruiting.
[02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:11.000]   I had like the best people who
[02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:13.000]   worked at me for me at FTX US.
[02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:15.000]   I had, you know, ex-colleagues
[02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:17.000]   of mine, you know, from former
[02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:19.000]   jobs that come work with me
[02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:20.000]   here.
[02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:21.000]   We didn't have to like, you
[02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:22.000]   know, do any formal recruiting
[02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:24.000]   efforts because of just how much
[02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:26.000]   supply there now is on the, you
[02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:28.000]   know, the job market for, you
[02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:29.000]   know, especially in tech and
[02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:30.000]   finance.
[02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:31.000]   Luckily, you know, I've had a
[02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:34.000]   long career history prior to
[02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:37.000]   FTX and even at FTX, you know,
[02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:38.000]   we built really great stuff.
[02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:40.000]   We had a very good connections,
[02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:41.000]   relationships with our
[02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:42.000]   customers and our investors.
[02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:44.000]   You know, there'll be times
[02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:46.000]   where like on Twitter, I would
[02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:47.000]   answer like a, you know,
[02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:49.000]   customers, you know, support
[02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:50.000]   question at two o'clock in the
[02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:51.000]   morning.
[02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:52.000]   And I maintained a lot of
[02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:54.000]   relationships, even through the
[02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:55.000]   collapse.
[02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:56.000]   And these are the kinds of
[02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:57.000]   people who are reaching out,
[02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:58.000]   like offering support, like
[02:29:58.000 --> 02:29:59.000]   offering to test out stuff who
[02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:00.000]   want to be customers who are
[02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:01.000]   also having problems with
[02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:02.000]   existing crypto tools and
[02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:04.000]   looking for something better.
[02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:05.000]   So all that stuff has remained
[02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:06.000]   intact.
[02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:07.000]   So I don't really have a
[02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:08.000]   concern there.
[02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:09.000]   What is institutional interest
[02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:11.000]   in crypto like at this point,
[02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:12.000]   given what's happened?
[02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:15.000]   I think it is just as great as
[02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:16.000]   it was before.
[02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:18.000]   Every like major, you know,
[02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:20.000]   investment bank in the US has
[02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:23.000]   announced some like plan to do
[02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:24.000]   something with blockchain
[02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:25.000]   technology.
[02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:27.000]   Still, even like post FTX, the
[02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:28.000]   top trading institutions of the
[02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:29.000]   world are all continuing to
[02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:30.000]   trade it.
[02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:32.000]   I think as of what we're
[02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:33.000]   speaking about right now, you
[02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:36.000]   know, volumes are down because
[02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:37.000]   people are sort of generally
[02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:38.000]   fearful.
[02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:39.000]   But I expect that to turn
[02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:41.000]   around pretty quickly.
[02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:42.000]   And the institutional interest
[02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:44.000]   still remains really high.
[02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:46.000]   People are definitely expecting
[02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:48.000]   and waiting for, you know,
[02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:49.000]   proper regulatory oversight,
[02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:50.000]   especially in the US.
[02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:51.000]   That's still happening.
[02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:52.000]   People are waiting for, you
[02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:54.000]   know, higher grade professional
[02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:56.000]   tools that make it safe for them
[02:30:56.000 --> 02:30:57.000]   to trade and invest in crypto.
[02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:58.000]   I think that's obviously in the
[02:30:58.000 --> 02:30:59.000]   works for various things,
[02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:01.000]   architect and otherwise.
[02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:02.000]   But otherwise, the interest is
[02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:03.000]   all completely there.
[02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:04.000]   A broader question somebody
[02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:05.000]   could have about crypto at this
[02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:08.000]   point is or maybe not crypto
[02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:10.000]   generally, but crypto trading is
[02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:12.000]   why is it good to have more
[02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:14.000]   crypto trading, at least with
[02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:16.000]   stocks and bonds and other kinds
[02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:18.000]   of traditional assets as we were
[02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:19.000]   talking about earlier?
[02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:20.000]   You can tell a story that
[02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:21.000]   listening to helps capital
[02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:24.000]   allocation, projects that need
[02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:26.000]   funding will get funding and so
[02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:27.000]   on.
[02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:29.000]   Why is it good if the price of
[02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:31.000]   Bitcoin is efficient?
[02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:33.000]   Why is building a product that
[02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:34.000]   enables that something that's
[02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:35.000]   socially valuable?
[02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:37.000]   I mean, I think it boils down
[02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:39.000]   to, like, first of all, do you
[02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:40.000]   think it's important for people
[02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:43.000]   to be able to trade commodities?
[02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:45.000]   Like, how important is it for
[02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:47.000]   the world that people can, you
[02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:49.000]   know, trade gold efficiently, or
[02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:51.000]   they can trade oil efficiently?
[02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:53.000]   I think the answer is, like, if
[02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:55.000]   people have a use for the
[02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:57.000]   underlying commodity, then it's
[02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:58.000]   important.
[02:31:58.000 --> 02:31:59.000]   And so, like, maybe then it's
[02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:00.000]   like, well, what's the use of
[02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:01.000]   crypto?
[02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:02.000]   Well, I think each crypto token
[02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.000]   might have its own use.
[02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:05.000]   I don't think everyone has a
[02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:06.000]   good use.
[02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:07.000]   I think that there's a bunch
[02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:08.000]   that do.
[02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:11.000]   But if, you know, you believe in
[02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:13.000]   Bitcoin as sort of like a store
[02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:14.000]   of value and a great medium of
[02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:15.000]   exchange, then it's important
[02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:17.000]   that there's a good fair price
[02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:18.000]   for Bitcoin to enable that.
[02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:20.000]   If you think that, you know, the
[02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:22.000]   Ether token is important for,
[02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:25.000]   like, the gas fees required to
[02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:26.000]   run, like, a decentralized
[02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:27.000]   computer, and you think that the
[02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:28.000]   programs running on a
[02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:29.000]   decentralized computer are
[02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:31.000]   important, then it's important
[02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:32.000]   for there to be, like, a good
[02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:34.000]   price for Ether that's fair.
[02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:35.000]   So I think it really depends on
[02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:36.000]   if you kind of believe in the
[02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:39.000]   underlying use case at all, in
[02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:40.000]   the same way you would for kind
[02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:41.000]   of any commodity.
[02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:42.000]   Yeah.
[02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:43.000]   And sometimes there are tokens
[02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:44.000]   that have more security-like
[02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:46.000]   properties where they are like
[02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:47.000]   trading Apple stock.
[02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:50.000]   You know, basically, like, there
[02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:51.000]   is an initial offering of that
[02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:53.000]   token, and then if people bought
[02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:55.000]   it, it actually directly funded
[02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:57.000]   the product behind the token,
[02:32:57.000 --> 02:32:59.000]   and then the efficient trading of
[02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:00.000]   that token is sort of a
[02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:01.000]   barometer for the health of that
[02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:03.000]   particular company, and they can,
[02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:04.000]   like, sell more tokens to raise
[02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:05.000]   more capital and secondary
[02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:06.000]   offerings, in which case it looks
[02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:08.000]   very much exactly like the stock
[02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:09.000]   market.
[02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:10.000]   That's a great lead-in to the
[02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:13.000]   next question, which is, will
[02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:16.000]   there ever be a time when things
[02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:19.000]   that are equivalent to stocks or
[02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:20.000]   other kinds of equities will be
[02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:22.000]   traded on change in some sort of
[02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:23.000]   decentralized way?
[02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:25.000]   I think it's likely.
[02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:27.000]   I think the primary reason is
[02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:31.000]   that existing settlement systems
[02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:33.000]   in traditional markets seem to be
[02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:35.000]   very slow and built on very
[02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:37.000]   outdated technology that's, like,
[02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:39.000]   highly non-transparent and very
[02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:40.000]   error-prone.
[02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:41.000]   So equities are a prime example
[02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:42.000]   of this.
[02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:44.000]   Like, it still requires two
[02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:47.000]   business days to settle a stock,
[02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:50.000]   and a frequent occurrence when I
[02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:52.000]   was at trading firms was that,
[02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:53.000]   you know, you would get your
[02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:55.000]   settlement file that, one, told
[02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:56.000]   you, like, what trades were
[02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:58.000]   settled, and, two, told you
[02:33:58.000 --> 02:33:59.000]   things like if any corporate
[02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:01.000]   actions had occurred overnight,
[02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:02.000]   like paying a dividend or share
[02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:04.000]   split, and they would frequently
[02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:05.000]   be wrong.
[02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:06.000]   Like, the dividend would be
[02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:07.000]   wrong, or it would be missing,
[02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:09.000]   or, like, the share split amount
[02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:10.000]   was for the wrong amount, or
[02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:11.000]   they missed the day that it
[02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:12.000]   happened, or they messed up some
[02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:13.000]   trade, it didn't get reported
[02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:14.000]   properly.
[02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:15.000]   There are just frequently
[02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:16.000]   mistakes.
[02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:17.000]   And it feels like there should
[02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:18.000]   be some, like, easy,
[02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:20.000]   transparent, kind of open,
[02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:22.000]   decentralized settlement layer
[02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:23.000]   for, like, all things that you
[02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:25.000]   could trade.
[02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:28.000]   And rather than try to retrofit
[02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:29.000]   the existing settlement
[02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:31.000]   technology to be faster and
[02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:32.000]   better, starting from scratch
[02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:33.000]   with something like blockchain
[02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:35.000]   could make a lot of sense, which
[02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:36.000]   is why you hear about a lot of,
[02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:37.000]   like, these investment banks
[02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:39.000]   working on settling fixed income
[02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:42.000]   products on-chain, because fixed
[02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:43.000]   income products have an even
[02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:44.000]   worse settlement cycle than
[02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:45.000]   equities.
[02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:48.000]   Should the marginal crypto
[02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:50.000]   trader stop trading?
[02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:52.000]   Like, maybe this might also be a
[02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:53.000]   good question to ask about, like,
[02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:55.000]   the marginal trader for, I don't
[02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:56.000]   know, on Robert Hood or
[02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:57.000]   something, but...
[02:34:57.000 --> 02:34:58.000]   I have a couple of thoughts
[02:34:58.000 --> 02:34:59.000]   about this.
[02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:01.000]   So, the first is that I don't
[02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:03.000]   think crypto markets are as
[02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:04.000]   efficient as equity markets.
[02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:05.000]   Yeah.
[02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:06.000]   So, there's probably more
[02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:08.000]   opportunities for short and
[02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:10.000]   long-term edge as a trader in
[02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:11.000]   crypto than there would be in
[02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:13.000]   equities.
[02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:16.000]   That being said, I think there's
[02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:18.000]   still an enormous amount of room
[02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:20.000]   in both, like, traditional and
[02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:22.000]   crypto markets for even
[02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:25.000]   individuals to have and derive
[02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:26.000]   information that gives them
[02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:28.000]   profitable trading ideas.
[02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:30.000]   And I actually think it's the
[02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:32.000]   wrong conventional wisdom to
[02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:34.000]   think that if you're not
[02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:36.000]   Jane Street or Citadel or
[02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:38.000]   Hudson River or Tower or, you
[02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:40.000]   know, jump trading, then you
[02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:42.000]   have no chance of being able to
[02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:44.000]   profit in markets except for
[02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:45.000]   luck.
[02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:46.000]   I do think there are a lot of
[02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:47.000]   people who trade and it's, like,
[02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:49.000]   pure speculation.
[02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:50.000]   It's not really, like, on me to
[02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:51.000]   tell them that, like, they
[02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:52.000]   shouldn't speculate.
[02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:53.000]   They probably, like, derive some
[02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:54.000]   personal enjoyment from
[02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:55.000]   speculation besides the
[02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:56.000]   opportunity for profit.
[02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:59.000]   But I do think the access to
[02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:01.000]   more sophisticated instruments
[02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:04.000]   and information has helped what
[02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:06.000]   have traditionally been, you
[02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:07.000]   know, players that have been
[02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:08.000]   unable to compete in the market
[02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:10.000]   actually be able to do so in a
[02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:11.000]   way that's systematically
[02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:12.000]   profitable.
[02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:14.000]   Okay, so that is, I think, a
[02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:15.000]   good point to end the
[02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:16.000]   conversation.
[02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:17.000]   We got a chance to talk about a
[02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:18.000]   lot of things.
[02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:20.000]   Let's let the audience know where
[02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:21.000]   they can find out more about
[02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:22.000]   Architect and also, like, where
[02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:24.000]   they can find your, you know,
[02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:25.000]   Twitter and other sorts of
[02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:26.000]   links.
[02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:27.000]   Sure, yeah.
[02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:28.000]   So Architect's website is
[02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:30.000]   architect.xyz.
[02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:31.000]   We also have architect_xyz on
[02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:32.000]   Twitter.
[02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:34.000]   And I'm @BrettHarrison88 on
[02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:35.000]   Twitter.
[02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:36.000]   Okay, perfect.
[02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:37.000]   Awesome.
[02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:38.000]   Brett, thank you so much for
[02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:39.000]   being on Lunar Society.
[02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:40.000]   This was a lot of fun.
[02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:42.000]   Thank you so much.
[02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:43.000]   Hey, everybody.
[02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:44.000]   I hope you enjoyed that
[02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:45.000]   episode.
[02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:47.000]   Just wanted to let you know that
[02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:49.000]   in order to help pay for the
[02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:51.000]   bills associated with this
[02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:53.000]   podcast, I'm turning on paid
[02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:56.000]   subscriptions on my SEP stack at
[02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:58.000]   varkeshpatel.com.
[02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:00.000]   No important content on this
[02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:02.000]   podcast will ever be paywalled,
[02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:04.000]   so please don't donate if you
[02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:05.000]   have to think twice before
[02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:07.000]   buying a cup of coffee.
[02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:08.000]   But if you have the means and
[02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:10.000]   you've enjoyed this podcast or
[02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:11.000]   gotten some kind of value out of
[02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:12.000]   it, I would really appreciate
[02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:13.000]   your support.
[02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:15.000]   As always, the most helpful
[02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:16.000]   thing you can do is just share
[02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:17.000]   the podcast.
[02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:18.000]   Send it to people you think
[02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:19.000]   might enjoy it.
[02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:20.000]   Put it in Twitter, your group
[02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:21.000]   chats, et cetera.
[02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:23.000]   Just splits the world.
[02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:24.000]   Appreciate you listening.
[02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:25.000]   I'll see you next time.
[02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:26.000]   Cheers.
