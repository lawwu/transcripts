[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.920]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:07.420]   All right.
[00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.400]   So ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to introduce
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.080]   Mr. Mel Lindauer.
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.000]   He was dubbed the Prince of the Bogleheads by Jack Bogle.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.560]   He is one of the Boglehead Forum's founders,
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.720]   along with Taylor Larimore.
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.200]   And he has contributed thousands of posts.
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.920]   He's been helping investors learn the Boglehead way.
[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.600]   He's the author of "The Boglehead's Guide
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.880]   to Investing," and one of the authors.
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.520]   In 2010, Mel helped create the John C. Bogle Center
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.520]   for Financial Literacy, and has been the president,
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.120]   or was the president, from 2012 to 2019.
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.640]   He's also an elected official, vice mayor,
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.840]   I believe, in Daytona Beach Shores,
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.840]   and was re-elected in 2018 and 2020.
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:08.200]   So with no further ado, let me introduce Mr. Mel Lindauer.
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.160]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.640]   Hello, everyone.
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.640]   Thank you.
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.000]   I'm sorry that because of my wife's health issues,
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.960]   I can't be with you in person this year.
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.760]   However, it's still great to be with you via video.
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.440]   This will be the first of our 20 conferences
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.520]   that I haven't attended in person.
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.200]   I understand that my good friend and partner-in-crime,
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.080]   Taylor Larimore, the king of the Bogleheads,
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.840]   will also be appearing on video immediately following me.
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.720]   I'm sure that's going to be an exciting session.
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.280]   Taylor and I go back a long way to the start of the Bogleheads
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.160]   on Morningstar nearly 25 years ago.
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.480]   Initially, there were no Bogleheads forums
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.280]   at Morningstar.
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.760]   Many Bogleheads were posting on the Morningstar mutual fund
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.160]   forum.
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.280]   Back then, Bogleheads was a derogatory term
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.720]   that others used to make fun of our group.
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.400]   [AUDIO OUT]
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.120]   --my thunder.
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.520]   Because others used Bogleheads as a derogatory term,
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.480]   when Morningstar eventually agreed
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.320]   to give us our own forum, they were
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.320]   hesitant to call it the Bogleheads forum.
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.960]   So they named it the Van Andorre Dialogues forum,
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.080]   and added a less noticeable sub-title,
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.840]   "Bogleheads Day and Night to Talk
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.320]   About Your Favorite Fan Company," or the fun company.
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.400]   Even though we didn't personally know each other,
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.480]   our small group of Bogleheads still felt like family.
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.720]   In their family spirit, I made a post
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.040]   on the forum at Thanksgiving time in 1999,
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.880]   expressing my thanks for all the good things I had in my life.
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.880]   Others jumped in, saying that was
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.080]   what they were thankful for.
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.280]   In addition to posting how thankful he
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.840]   was for his wife and family, Taylor
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.600]   stated that he was also thankful for his beautiful condo
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.920]   overlooking Biscayne Bay that he calls the house--
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:10.960]   OK, Taylor.
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.400]   OK, Mel, Mel, you're just taking all my thunder
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.900]   here.
[00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:14.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.380]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.840]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.840]   Jack Bogle, Jack Bogle was responsible for his investment
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.840]   success and his ability to live the good life
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.320]   in his beautiful condo.
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.320]   Jack Bogle saw that post and sent a handwritten note
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.320]   to Taylor, asking Methods if there was any way,
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.320]   any interest in us Bogleheads getting together with him,
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.800]   at a non-resort place, typical Jack.
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.300]   For us, that was like getting an invitation to the White House
[00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.800]   for an audience with the Pope.
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:49.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.280]   So Taylor and I started trying to figure out
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.280]   how we could take Jack up on his generous offer.
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.280]   At that time, I was for Snowbird,
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.280]   sending my winners to Florida.
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.780]   Knowing that, Taylor contacted me,
[00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.280]   letting me know that Jack was going
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.760]   to be the keynote speaker, along with none other than Jim
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.720]   Craver, at the Miami Herald Maker Money Seminar in January,
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.200]   and wondering if we should try to see if we can get together
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.200]   with Jim there.
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.200]   I agreed, and the planning started.
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.700]   I contacted the Miami Herald Group,
[00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.700]   asking if they could provide us with a time
[00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.700]   to play during the seminar, where we could have
[00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.200]   a fun lunch with Jack.
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.200]   They shooed us away by group, because they
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.680]   didn't have time to meet with us.
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.680]   Jack called Jack's office and told him what they said.
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.160]   Jack's response was, "I'll go anywhere you'd like."
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.160]   So we made plans to get together with Jack
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.640]   at a private affair in Taylor's lovely Miami condo.
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.640]   We barged in staff to help with the dinner,
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.640]   and Taylor and I hosted Jack in about a 20-something overhead,
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.140]   at an evening with Jack Boone that none of us
[00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.140]   will ever forget.
[00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.640]   I should point out that once the Miami Herald folks found out
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.120]   that Jack would be joining us bogaheads off-site,
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.620]   they came hat in hand and asked if they could send
[00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:17.120]   a photographer and a reporter to cover our evening with Jack.
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.120]   Instead of being jerks by refusing to commentate them
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.620]   as they had done to us, we allowed them to join us,
[00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.120]   and ended up with a great story with pictures of our evening
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.640]   with Jack on the front page of the Sunday business section
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.140]   of the Miami Herald.
[00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:37.640]   After that lovely dinner, we all sat around in the living room
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.140]   and chatted with Jack as he answered everyone's questions
[00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:45.140]   and chatted about whatever anyone inquired about.
[00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:48.140]   It was truly a magical evening.
[00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.140]   Jack then said that he wanted to make a post
[00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:53.640]   on the Morning Star Forum telling all the bogaheads
[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.640]   who couldn't attend what a great night he had that evening
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.140]   with his bogaheads in Florida.
[00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.640]   When making that Morning Star Forum post,
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.140]   Jack named Taylor the king of the bogaheads
[00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:07.140]   and me the prince of the bogaheads.
[00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:11.140]   I told Taylor countless times that this is one prince
[00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:14.640]   who has no desire to be king, so he's going to have to
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.140]   stick around as long as I do.
[00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:20.140]   So far at age 98, Taylor's doing a great job
[00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:24.140]   of living up to his part of our bargain.
[00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.640]   Taylor and I had figured that the Miami get-together
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:30.140]   with Jack was a one-time event, but then other bogaheads
[00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:33.640]   who weren't able to attend the Miami get-together with Jack
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:38.140]   started asking when and where the next event would be held.
[00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:41.140]   A bogahead named Dave owned a farm near Vanguard
[00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.140]   and offered to host our second event.
[00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:48.140]   Sadly, Dave died before the scheduled event,
[00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:53.140]   but his family insisted on holding the event in Dave's honor.
[00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:56.640]   Jack Bogle served as our guide as we toured nearby Vanguard,
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.640]   and Jason Swagg, who was with Money magazine at that time,
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.640]   spoke at the event and ended up writing a very nice story
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:07.140]   with lots of photos for Money magazine titled
[00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:09.640]   "Here Come the Bogleheads."
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:14.140]   Future events were planned around events where Jack was speaking.
[00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:16.640]   Morningstar hosted us for our third event
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:20.140]   at their big event in Chicago where Jack was speaking,
[00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:23.140]   and other groups, such as the CFA Institute,
[00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:26.140]   did the same in future years.
[00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:29.140]   Eventually, though, we ran out of invitations to hold our events
[00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:33.640]   in coordination with an event where Jack was speaking.
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:38.640]   In 2005, when Teller and I were busy writing our first book,
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:42.640]   Jack asked me when the next event was going to be held.
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:46.640]   I told him that we couldn't coordinate it with anywhere where he was speaking,
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:50.140]   and that's when Jack told me not to worry about where he was speaking,
[00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:52.640]   that he'd go wherever we wanted him.
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:57.640]   That's when we went out on our own, using local Boglehead chapters
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:02.140]   to help with the coordination of the subsequent conferences
[00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:04.140]   around the country.
[00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:07.140]   At this time, I need to give a big shout-out to my former
[00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:10.140]   Vogel Center board and conference team members
[00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:14.140]   who made the previous events such a great success.
[00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:19.140]   They included Pat and Eddie Rager, and Paul and Linda Gloverson.
[00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:22.140]   And several other members of my team are volunteering
[00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:24.640]   right here at the conference again today.
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.640]   Mel and Kathy Turner and Gail Cox.
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:32.640]   I called them my dream team, and that title was well-deserved.
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:36.640]   They made me look good, for which I'm eternally grateful.
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:42.140]   And now, with the passing of the torch to the new Boglehead Center board members,
[00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:47.140]   the Boglehead conferences are going to live on bigger and better than ever.
[00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:49.140]   Enjoy your conference experience.
[00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:52.140]   Hopefully, I'll see you next year.
[00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:54.140]   Thank you, Mel.
[00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:56.140]   [applause]
[00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:59.140]   Wait, wait, wait.
[00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:01.140]   One more time for Mel.
[00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:03.140]   All right.
[00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:06.140]   [applause]
[00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:08.140]   Thank you, everybody.
[00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:12.140]   Thank you so much, Mel, for taking the time today.
[00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:14.140]   I know how busy you are.
[00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:18.140]   And we hope that everything goes well for you and for Marlene.
[00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:23.140]   So take care, and we'll see you at the conference next year.
[00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:24.140]   Sounds good, Rick.
[00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:25.140]   You take care.
[00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:26.140]   Semper Fi, everybody.
[00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:27.140]   Semper Fi.
[00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:28.140]   Semper Fi.
[00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:38.140]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
