[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:13.840]   Paul's epistle to the Romans in chapter 10 and verse 15, in the 15th verse of the 10th
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.140]   chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans.
[00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.760]   And how shall they preach except they be sent?
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:29.080]   As it is written, "How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.600]   bring glad tidings of good things."
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:41.420]   I want in particular to look with you at that phrase, "the gospel of peace."
[00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:48.080]   We've been looking together for a number of Sunday evenings at what is said in the Bible
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:54.400]   itself about the Christian gospel and the Christian message.
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:01.240]   And we are doing that because of the appalling confusion that seems to exist with regard
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.300]   to that very subject.
[00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.240]   This is, as I keep on saying, one of the most astounding things of all, that after nearly
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.400]   2,000 years, and with a Bible in a language that we can understand, that men and women
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:21.400]   still have such strange and extraordinary notions as to what the gospel is, what its
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.360]   message is, what it is meant to tell us.
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:33.280]   And it is because that in turn leads to so much personal unhappiness and misery and frustration
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:43.440]   in life, and so much general, national, global unhappiness, strife, and misery, that I call
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.040]   your attention to this most vital subject.
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:54.880]   The message of the Christian church is that the greatest need of the world is the gospel.
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.600]   But that means that we must know what it is, what it says, what it teaches, what it has
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.280]   to offer.
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.160]   And as I've been suggesting, the best way to discover that is to go to it itself.
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:13.280]   After all, a man living in 1964 is not the man to consult as to what the content of the
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.860]   Christian gospel is.
[00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.560]   You trace everything back to its origin.
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.760]   Where did the Christian church come from?
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.440]   How did she ever begin?
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.520]   That's the obvious question to ask.
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:30.000]   It's no use saying now, of course, we live in 1964, and we are in such a greatly advantageous
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.520]   position as the result of our knowledge that we need some special message.
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.360]   All right, you can say that if you like, but all I say is this.
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.280]   That's got nothing to do with what the gospel actually is.
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.180]   This is something that has been preached now for nearly 2,000 years.
[00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.760]   So the way to discover what this is, is to go back to the beginning.
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.720]   And that means, as we read in that second chapter of the epistle to the Ephesians at
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.960]   the beginning, the church is builded and founded upon the foundation of Christ Jesus himself
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.740]   and with him the apostles and prophets.
[00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:13.760]   It was the preaching of these men that brought the Christian church into being.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.500]   They were sent out, commissioned by the Lord Jesus Christ himself to do this very thing,
[00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.300]   and they went and they did it, and he put the power of the Spirit in them to enable
[00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:24.560]   them to do it.
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.700]   And as the result of their preaching of the message, Christian churches came into being.
[00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.560]   That's the origin of the Christian church.
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.480]   It came as the result of the message.
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.120]   It's the message that produced the church.
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:44.120]   So obviously our business is to go back and to discover what it is these men themselves
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.980]   said about this gospel, and we've been doing so.
[00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.320]   We spent our five Sunday nights in November in looking at that great phrase about the
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.320]   mystery of the gospel.
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.320]   And of course, as we saw, that is tremendously important and relevant.
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:05.680]   Now tonight I hold again before you one other of these descriptions of the gospel, the gospel
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.680]   of peace.
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.600]   This is one of the ways in which it is described by this great apostle, and not only by him,
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:20.640]   but in many other places in the New Testament in various forms.
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.160]   Now let's look at it like this.
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.040]   Why did the Lord Jesus Christ ever come into this world?
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.160]   We've been looking at that.
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.240]   Great is the mystery of godliness.
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.160]   God was manifest in the flesh.
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.920]   We are approaching the Christmas season.
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.600]   This is what is called the season of Advent, and it's very right that we should be considering
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.600]   it together.
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.680]   What's the meaning of Christmas Day?
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.000]   These are the questions that we should ask.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.520]   And then if we believe that the Son of God was born there as a baby in Bethlehem, the
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.200]   question we ask is, why did that happen?
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.200]   Why did it take place?
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.200]   What's the object?
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.840]   What's the purpose?
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.080]   What did he himself say about it?
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.880]   Why did he come into the world?
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:07.880]   What was his message?
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.240]   He's brought some message to us.
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.000]   What is this message?
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.040]   Why do we call the four gospels gospels, which means good news?
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.320]   Why do we call them good news?
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:27.980]   What is this wonderful good news that the Son of God has brought into this world?
[00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:35.600]   Now the answer to that so frequently is this very phrase that we are looking at tonight.
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:41.120]   He came to bring the gospel of peace.
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:47.680]   You remember how, just as he was born, the shepherds were there in the field watching
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:53.800]   their flocks by night, and suddenly they were surrounded by the most heavenly and angelic
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.920]   singing conceivable.
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.720]   What was it that the heavenly choir was singing?
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:59.720]   You remember?
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:05.760]   "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, peace."
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:12.040]   See, the first announcement concerning him is this, is one of peace, goodwill towards
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.040]   men.
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:19.520]   Yes, but on earth, peace, peace if you like to men, of goodwill, doesn't matter, it's
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:20.520]   peace.
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.800]   That's the first announcement when he's only just been born.
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:30.000]   So you see, this is obviously at the very heart and center of this whole question as
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.160]   to why he came into the world at all.
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.500]   And if you read the four gospels, keep your eye on this word peace.
[00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:42.800]   Our Lord was constantly using it.
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:47.560]   You remember just before the end, he turned to his disciples and told them that he was
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:51.880]   going to die, that he was going to be put to death, and he saw they were troubled, so
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:56.480]   he turned to them and he said, "Let not your heart be troubled."
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:00.360]   He believed in God, believe also in me, etc.
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:04.640]   Then he goes on to say to them, "Peace I give unto you.
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.000]   My peace give I unto you.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.440]   Not as the world giveth, give I unto you.
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:12.280]   Let not your heart be troubled.
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.760]   Neither let it be afraid."
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:19.440]   Now those are his words and they're so typical of him.
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:25.800]   And here we've got it here in this epistle of the Apostle Paul to the Romans, and he
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.600]   keeps on repeating it.
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:34.080]   Now he says, "May the God of peace give you peace and keep you in a state of peace."
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:38.520]   And then you noticed it in that chapter which we read at the beginning, how the Apostle
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:43.880]   Paul, he delights in this, "He is our peace, who hath made both one."
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:49.400]   And especially this, "And he came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:53.040]   that were nigh peace."
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:57.720]   It's the great characteristic of this gospel.
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:04.440]   And there is that glorious, tremendous doxology in the thirteenth chapter of the epistle to
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:05.440]   the Hebrews.
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:13.040]   "Now may the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:18.120]   of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant, make you perfect in every good work
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:22.920]   to do his will, working in you that which is well-pleasing in his sight through Jesus
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:29.360]   Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever, the God of peace."
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.400]   What a designation of God.
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:35.200]   And at the same time, a designation of the gospel.
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:38.960]   Because it is God who has sent his Son into the world.
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:45.360]   God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son.
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:51.360]   When the fullness of the times was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:54.720]   under the law to redeem them that are under the law.
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:58.040]   It is God the Father who has sent his Son into the world.
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:03.080]   The Son came very willingly and was strengthened and enabled to do his work by the blessed
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.400]   Holy Spirit.
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:08.120]   But why, I ask, why did it all happen?
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:10.720]   And you see, this is the answer.
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:14.400]   It is because God is the God of peace.
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:19.120]   It is because the Son is the Prince of peace.
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:24.520]   Because he had come to preach peace to them that are afar off, as well as to them that
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:29.240]   are nigh, them that are nigh of the Jews, them that are afar off of the Gentiles.
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.560]   He has come to preach peace.
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:38.840]   So it is not surprising that the angels should be singing, "Peace on earth, good will amongst
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:39.840]   men."
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:46.560]   Very well, then, so the question that remains for us to answer is this, why is it put in
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:49.400]   this particular form?
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:56.120]   Why is the gospel rightly described as the gospel of peace?
[00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:58.600]   Let me answer that question with you.
[00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:02.760]   My dear friend, there is nothing more relevant to the condition of everybody listening to
[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:06.400]   my words at this moment than just this very thing.
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:09.960]   The greatest need in the world at this moment is peace.
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:15.000]   Now, don't misunderstand me, you must be quite clear as to the meaning of the word
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.520]   peace.
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:20.880]   The moment I say the greatest need in the world tonight is peace, I can imagine some
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:26.280]   people saying, "Quite right, it's about time you began to deal with that sort of subject,
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:31.320]   and you ought to be preparing us tonight for the Prime Minister's journeying to America
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:35.440]   to have a conference with the President of the United States, and you should be telling
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.860]   both those men what they should do and what they should not do.
[00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:42.080]   You should outline to them how they are to conduct their affairs and what they are to
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:45.020]   do about armaments and all these intricate matters."
[00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:52.440]   No, no, my dear friend, that isn't what is meant by peace here.
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:58.680]   That's one of the sad illusions, that's one of the sad misunderstandings of the gospel
[00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:01.800]   that is so current today.
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:02.800]   What is it then?
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:08.900]   Well, that's the peace that the world thinks of, that's the world's notion of peace.
[00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:14.640]   The world thinks of peace as the mere absence of war.
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:17.520]   That's how the world defines peace.
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:23.440]   It thinks of peace as a condition in which men are no longer fighting.
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:30.640]   The world indeed tends to think of peace in terms of avoidance of problems, getting rid
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:39.080]   of difficulties, in order that we may go on living the life we want to live.
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:40.760]   Many are interested in it like that.
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:43.000]   War is a bit of a nuisance.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.200]   If war comes, well, you can't go on dancing all night, you'll probably be conscripted
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:51.000]   into an army, and you'll be sent to bed at a given hour, and you'll have to get up at
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   a given hour.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.240]   And they say, "We don't believe in war, we want peace."
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.760]   What do they want peace for?
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:02.960]   They want peace to go on drinking, to go on dancing, to go on gambling, and the various
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:05.400]   other things they do.
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:09.520]   That's not the biblical notion of peace.
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:13.760]   Peace is not merely a state and a condition in which there's no active warfare, and therefore
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:19.400]   we can go on living to the world and the flesh and the devil.
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:21.880]   That's not the biblical idea of peace.
[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:23.640]   Well, what is it?
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:28.400]   Well, the biblical idea of peace is this.
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:38.880]   It's that a man has a quiet heart, a quiet mind, a heart at leisure from itself, a heart
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:41.680]   at rest.
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:45.400]   The hymn we've been singing, one of the hymns we've been singing, puts it very well.
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:52.320]   "Peace, perfect peace in this dark world of sin," and the gospel says, "Yes, yes, it's
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:53.320]   possible."
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:59.560]   In this dark world of sin, as it is, the blood of Jesus whispers, "Peace within."
[00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:03.240]   Now, this is the biblical idea of sin.
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:08.800]   It's that very thing that I've quoted to you from our Lord, as he's reported in the fourteenth
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:13.240]   chapter of John's gospel, "Let not your heart be troubled."
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.240]   That's it.
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:17.880]   You've no longer got a troubled heart.
[00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:22.020]   The antithesis of that is a heart at rest, a heart of peace.
[00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:26.640]   Peace is an inward state and condition.
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:31.680]   It is something that Paul says to the Philippians, "that passeth all understanding."
[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:38.520]   "Let nothing be anxious, but in all things with prayer and supplication and thanksgiving
[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:46.720]   let your requests be made known unto God, and the peace of God that passeth all understanding
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:51.480]   shall keep your hearts and minds in the knowledge of Christ Jesus."
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:52.480]   It's that sort of thing.
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:58.040]   That's what the Bible means by this message about peace.
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:02.160]   So we must be clear with regard to the definition of the term.
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:05.920]   Now then, having done that, let me ask the next question.
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:10.080]   Why is it that the world lacks peace?
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:14.880]   Why does the world need a gospel of peace?
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:15.880]   There's the question.
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:19.080]   We all know that it does.
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:23.960]   How many of us know real peace and rest?
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:34.040]   Have you got a quiet heart, have you got a mind at rest, do you know a fundamental tranquility,
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:39.840]   an ultimate sense of satisfaction, a place of rest?
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:40.840]   Have you got it?
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:48.600]   No, no, the world is full of restlessness, it's full of dis-ease, it's unquiet.
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:51.760]   Now, I could easily prove that to you.
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:54.360]   It's become a platitude to say these things.
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:57.360]   Any man who knows anything about the work of the medical profession has been knowing
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:58.360]   it for years.
[00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:02.440]   This has been the increasing problem of the twentieth century in particular.
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:05.560]   It's always been a problem, but it's been particularly the problem of the twentieth
[00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:06.840]   century.
[00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:12.080]   This is the age, the century of the neuroses.
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:17.720]   This is the age that has had to talk more than ever before about functional diseases,
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:21.840]   psychosomatic diseases.
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:27.560]   You see, it isn't actual organic disease that constitutes the major problem in this
[00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:28.560]   century.
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:37.000]   No, no, it's this other element, psychosomatic, the nervous element, the functional, no actual
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.880]   organic disease, and yet the poor man or the poor woman feels ill and so on.
[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:43.880]   Why is it?
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:50.120]   Well, I once had the privilege of looking at the case book and cards of a great physician,
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:54.860]   and I found that he often put this sort of diagnosis down when he'd seen so-and-so eats
[00:15:54.860 --> 00:16:01.680]   too much, drinks too much, dances too much, doesn't sleep enough.
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:08.240]   That's the sort of thing about which I'm speaking, and the world, I say, is full of that sort
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:09.240]   of condition.
[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:13.280]   Men and women are not at ease, there's a restlessness.
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:16.480]   You see, the pleasure mania is just a manifestation of that.
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:19.640]   That's why I try always not to denounce it.
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:26.240]   A man who lives for pleasure is not a man to be denounced, he's a man to be pitied.
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:31.640]   You know, the sort of person who has to go out every night to a cinema or a public house
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:36.400]   or somewhere else, who has to do it, I say is an object of great pity, and we should
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:39.440]   feel a great sense of compassion towards such people.
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:40.440]   Why?
[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:45.640]   Well, it's obvious, you see, that kind of man or woman can't spend an evening with himself
[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:51.640]   or herself, has to be running away from self always, forgetting self in some shape or form.
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:55.040]   It's because there's a fundamental restlessness.
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:17:03.120]   A philosopher once described and defined religion as that which a man does with his own solitude,
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:06.760]   and there's something in that.
[00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:13.160]   I venture to assert the only man really in the end who can take solitude is a Christian.
[00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:16.360]   And as you know, the history of the church shows that.
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:19.220]   Some of them deliberately chose it.
[00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:23.120]   We think they were wrong because they went to excess, but it indicates the truth.
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:26.520]   Solitude, what does a man do with his own solitude?
[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:28.800]   That's the test of you and of me.
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:33.040]   Imagine yourself cut off from all your friends and boon companions and all your books and
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:39.960]   television and everything else, just absolute isolation, how would you get on?
[00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:42.040]   That's the question.
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:44.840]   And the world needs peace.
[00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:46.560]   But why is it in this condition?
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:52.640]   Well, now, this is the great message of the Bible, and the answer can be put in one word,
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:55.800]   a little word, but a profound thing.
[00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:58.360]   It's called sin.
[00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:07.000]   And the whole cause of all our ills and troubles and restlessness is simply sin.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   Nothing else.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.120]   It's the sole explanation.
[00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:15.360]   This is true of individuals, it's true of the world in general.
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:21.060]   If you are particularly interested in the question of actual physical warfare, well,
[00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:23.300]   it's the sole explanation even there.
[00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:27.720]   You remember how James puts it in the fourth chapter of his epistle, "From whence come
[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:29.360]   wars and fightings among you?"
[00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:30.360]   Now that's the question.
[00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:33.640]   We've had two of them in this century, these horrible world wars.
[00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:35.400]   Where have they come from?
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:43.240]   Ah, you say, Kaiser, Hitler, politics, armament firms working behind the backs of governments
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:44.600]   in order to make money.
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:47.680]   These are the things that men talk about and write books about, and they think they're
[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:48.960]   being very clever.
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:51.840]   And it can all be put right if you only expose these things.
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:53.880]   They've been doing this sort of thing for so long.
[00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:58.560]   But listen, "Whence come wars and fightings among you?
[00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:04.800]   Come they not hence even of your lusts that war in your members?
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:06.480]   You lust and have not.
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:09.240]   You kill and desire to have and cannot obtain.
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:12.720]   You fight and war, yet you have not because you ask not.
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:19.480]   You ask and receive not because you ask amidst that you may consume it upon your lusts."
[00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:27.360]   That's the explanation of all war and every manifestation of a lack of peace.
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:32.080]   Now here, I say, is the way to understand the gospel of peace.
[00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:41.320]   The world needs peace because it once lost it.
[00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:43.800]   It had it at the beginning.
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:49.120]   Man was created perfectly, he was put in a place called paradise, perfect peace, nothing
[00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:55.040]   going wrong, nothing in any way detracting from the equanimity and the joy and the happiness
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:56.480]   of it all.
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:01.840]   But immediately, man rebelled against God and sinned.
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:03.880]   He lost his peace.
[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:09.200]   Now, you see this in a most graphic manner in the third chapter of the book of Genesis.
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:13.600]   Adam and Eve would be living in paradise and enjoying communion with God.
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:15.040]   They sin against him.
[00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:16.120]   What happens?
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:17.560]   They discover they're naked.
[00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:18.800]   They're already in trouble.
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:21.840]   They hear the voice of the Lord God in the garden in the cool of the evening.
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:24.080]   They run and hide behind a tree.
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:27.400]   They're troubled, they're distressed, they've never known this before.
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.240]   But now they're troubled.
[00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:32.760]   And not only that, you notice, each one blames the other.
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:34.320]   There's the whole of life for you.
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:35.600]   It started at once.
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:39.840]   The moment they sinned, all the things that you and I know about, they immediately came
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:40.840]   in.
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:45.520]   The fear, the self-accusation, the accusation of others, all that we know to be so true
[00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:49.480]   of life, it all came in immediately.
[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:54.640]   And their subsequent life shows it more and more.
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:58.600]   They have to work now and earn their bread by the sweat of their brow.
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:01.520]   There's an enmity between them and the seed of the woman.
[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:03.720]   You see it again in the case of Cain and Abel.
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:07.840]   Oh, my dear friends, don't talk to me about 1964.
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:12.760]   If you want to understand 1964, go back to the beginning of the Bible.
[00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:14.480]   Read the early chapters of Genesis.
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:16.440]   You've got the only explanation.
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:18.800]   You don't need psychology, it's all here.
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:22.640]   Cain and Abel, two brothers, one murders the other.
[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:23.640]   Why?
[00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:24.640]   Sin?
[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:30.040]   That's the sort of thing that sin invariably leads to.
[00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:33.500]   And you go on and read the whole subsequent history.
[00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:37.320]   In the Old Testament, you've got it all.
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:41.880]   The perfect description and the perfect explanation.
[00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:44.720]   And it is still the same today.
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:49.380]   Now the point I'm emphasizing, you see, is this.
[00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:54.040]   The world needs peace because it's lost it.
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:58.120]   Peace has been lost.
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:01.880]   And we need to have it back.
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:07.480]   Don't believe this teaching which says that the restlessness is just a part of the growing
[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:10.300]   pains of humanity.
[00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:11.300]   That's what they'd have you believe.
[00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:13.540]   They've got to have some explanation.
[00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:17.040]   You see, you can't go on saying to the world that man is getting better and better and
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:20.640]   that the world is getting better and better when you see from your newspapers that it
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:22.360]   seems to be going in the opposite direction.
[00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:28.640]   Oh, it's all right, they say, these are growing pains, you know, children get growing pains.
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:33.480]   And when you're working your way out from a state of serfdom to a state of great liberty,
[00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:36.780]   well, there are obviously going to be times of readjustments.
[00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:39.960]   You get it with new governments and you get it with the whole of the human race.
[00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:41.700]   You don't expect everything to be right in a second.
[00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:46.000]   There must be incidental problems and difficulties, but we'll work our way through them.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:52.600]   Indeed, the pain is a very proof of our advancement, is it?
[00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:56.000]   According to the Bible, it's the exact opposite.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.880]   It is degeneration that always causes the pain and the restlessness.
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:07.740]   Man once had peace, and you know he knows it.
[00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:10.060]   This is the extraordinary thing.
[00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:13.840]   If you want psychology, well, have biblical psychology.
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:21.440]   And its teaching is that man, in spite of what he may say he believes, has got an innate
[00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:27.200]   feeling within him that he was not meant for what he is, nor what he has.
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:33.320]   Man has got a feeling within him that he was meant for something better and something bigger.
[00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:41.560]   It's nothing but a recollection of the peace he once had and enjoyed.
[00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:46.440]   It's there in the whole of the human race, it can't be stifled.
[00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:48.880]   Man has this feeling that he wasn't meant for this.
[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:53.400]   He doesn't understand it and he puts up his wrong theories and ideas and proposals, as
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:54.480]   I'm telling you.
[00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:58.040]   But you see, the vital thing is that he's got the feeling there.
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:06.760]   It's the memory, the racial memory, if you like, of a peace that man once enjoyed and
[00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:08.560]   which he feels he should have.
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:13.600]   Very well, there is the beginning of the biblical explanation, but we must analyze it a little
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:20.640]   bit further because it's only as we understand the cause of our restlessness and our dis-ease
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:26.440]   that we shall really see the vital importance of the message of peace.
[00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:33.080]   Lack of peace, then, I say, results from sin, because sin always leads to the following
[00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:34.080]   consequences.
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:41.800]   One, first and most important, a wrong relationship to God.
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:48.600]   That's the tragedy of the modern world, that they're trying to produce peace without
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:50.160]   even mentioning God.
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:56.120]   We're looking to men for peace, we're looking to human proposals for peace.
[00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:59.760]   If you leave God out, you'll never have peace, impossible.
[00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:03.640]   Here's the primary cause of the lack of peace.
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:09.800]   Sin leads to wrong relationships to God.
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:15.360]   By biblical teaching puts it in these words, the natural mind is enmity against God.
[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:21.440]   He's not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be, and that at once produces restlessness.
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:26.400]   The law of God is there, it's God's world, and he's made it, and he's made me, and
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:31.200]   he's put laws into me, and he's put laws into the whole universe.
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:35.720]   And if I'm fighting against the laws of the universe and the God who has made the
[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:43.480]   universe and the laws, I'm bound to be in trouble, and I am in trouble for that reason.
[00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:50.000]   Man was made for God, and he was made in such a way that he's only complete and full and
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.520]   only knows peace and rest as long as he's conforming to the laws of his being, and that
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:26:01.280]   means that he lives to the glory and the praise of God.
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:05.320]   And if he doesn't do that, he's lost his peace.
[00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:09.040]   He's fighting against something, and it's there, do as he will, he can't get away from
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:10.040]   it.
[00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:17.000]   Oh, many men have expressed this, none perhaps so movingly as Francis Thompson in The Hound
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   of Heaven.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:24.320]   "I chased him down the nights and down the days and down the labyrinthine ways of my
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:31.280]   own mind," this Hound of Heaven, you see, you can't get away, God, the psalmist describes
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:38.360]   it from the 139th Psalm, now there it is, enmity against God.
[00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:42.560]   While a man's at enmity against God, he'll never know peace, but he doesn't stop at
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:47.160]   enmity, as I've shown you in the case of Adam and Eve, it leads to the fear of God.
[00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:53.720]   And the fear of God is something that disturbs one to the very depths, and it's in the whole
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:59.240]   of the human race, the most primitive races have this sense of a supreme God, and it leads
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:00.240]   to fear.
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:04.840]   Of course, religion's attacked on those grounds as being simply a matter of fear and holding
[00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:07.520]   people down, but you get rid of it if you can.
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:13.120]   You can't get rid of it, it's there, it's inevitable, because God is there and man is
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:18.440]   under God, but not only that, you see.
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:25.680]   The real trouble about man is, and this is where he's such a fool, the modern man, the
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:29.560]   modern man is afraid of life.
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:31.000]   Why is he afraid of life?
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.400]   Well, simply because he's not big enough to handle it.
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:37.480]   He thinks he is, intellectually he thinks he is.
[00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:42.120]   He says, "We don't need a God, we know now, we discovered that we didn't need God about
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:46.480]   the middle of the last century, and with all our education and science especially, we can
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:48.360]   manage the universe without God."
[00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:52.000]   But you know, the universe is a mighty big thing, my friend, and when you've got the
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:57.040]   universe on your hands, you're not going to get much sleep, you know.
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:02.000]   Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown, quite right, the higher your responsibility, the
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.640]   greater the strain that's upon you, and you're likely to lose your sleep.
[00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:10.120]   But if you think, as modern man thinks, that he can handle the universe, I'm not surprised
[00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:13.960]   that he's restless, I'm not surprised that he doesn't know much about peace, I'm not
[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:20.040]   surprised that he's living on anodynes and soporifics and various hypnotics, he needs
[00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:21.040]   them.
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:27.840]   The task of running the universe is too big, and man is too small, so he's afraid of life,
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:31.680]   he's afraid of the unknown future.
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:32.680]   What's going to happen?
[00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:36.840]   And he reads his paper, and some are even afraid to, and they say, "I don't want to
[00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:38.120]   hear the news, I'm afraid.
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:39.120]   What's going to happen?"
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:41.600]   It's the thing that's coming and gripping people increasingly.
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:45.360]   It's all because man is in the wrong relationship to God.
[00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:48.000]   He feels the universe is in his hands, and he can't manage it.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.760]   It's too big for him, it's running away with him, the forces he's unleashing, he can't
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:55.560]   handle them, this terrific power, he doesn't know how to use it.
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:59.080]   That's the essence of the modern problem.
[00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:09.220]   And then always the thought of death, and what lies beyond it, oh, let me quote it again,
[00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:16.160]   that unknown bond from which no traveler returns, that unknown country from whose bond no traveler
[00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:19.080]   returns, that's the trouble.
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:22.960]   That's the perplexity of your hamlets, and we're all hamlets, to be or not to be.
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:23.960]   I'll do this!
[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:24.960]   Ah, but what?
[00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:25.960]   How do I know?
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:26.960]   What if?
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:35.000]   And there you are, and the feeling that we all have within us, and whether we have it
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:41.720]   acutely or not, it doesn't matter, it remains a fact, the wrath of God upon all ungodliness
[00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:48.800]   and unrighteousness, it's there, it's manifest in history, it's manifest in conscience, it's
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:54.040]   manifest everywhere, the wrath of God upon sin, that's why the world lacks peace.
[00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:56.580]   Let me hurry on.
[00:29:56.580 --> 00:30:01.160]   You see, sin always leads, as I say, to a wrong view of God, and a wrong relationship
[00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:06.320]   to God, but it just leads to something which is even more idiotic in a sense, it leads
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:14.800]   to a wrong view of self, and it leads to a wrong condition of a man's self.
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:18.080]   Now let me show you what I mean.
[00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:25.280]   There's a great statement made by the prophet Isaiah in chapter 57, he says, "The wicked
[00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:31.480]   are like the troubled sea when it cannot find rest, whose waters throw up mire and mud."
[00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:37.520]   Have you ever heard a more perfect description of men, individually or collectively, as he
[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:43.040]   is today, as he always is in a state of sin, "The wicked are like the troubled sea when
[00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:49.040]   it cannot rest, with waters throwing up mud and mire."
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:52.480]   There's men in this wrong relationship to God.
[00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:58.560]   Now, sin is what causes men to be like that, and it's a true description, isn't it?
[00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:01.400]   Isn't it true of you?
[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:06.240]   Are you like the sea tonight, or are you like a mountain?
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:14.160]   Is your life solid, sound, or is it like the troubled sea, always moving, wondering what's
[00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:17.520]   happening at the whim and fancy of anybody you may happen to meet?
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:20.600]   You don't know what you're going to be like at night when you start out in the morning,
[00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:21.600]   and you don't know what's going to happen to you.
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:26.760]   Like the sea, governed by other influences, always restless, moving, never sudden.
[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:27.760]   Is it that?
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:28.760]   Well, what's the cause of this?
[00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:33.120]   Well, there's a full analysis of it here in the Bible.
[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:39.840]   You see, what sin does is to give us a wrong view of ourselves, and what's that?
[00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:43.840]   Well, it makes us the center, makes us the center of the universe.
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:45.280]   That was the original temptation.
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:49.520]   "Hath God said, 'Did God say this to you,' said the serpent to Eve?
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:50.800]   You know why he said that?
[00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:52.520]   He said that in order to keep you down.
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:53.840]   You were meant to be gods.
[00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:56.200]   He knows if you eat that fruit, you'll be like gods.
[00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:57.640]   Look here, it's unfair to you."
[00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:58.640]   And she believed him.
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:31:59.640]   Adam believed him.
[00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:05.080]   And immediately, they've got a wrong view of self.
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:11.520]   The whole cause of restlessness in the human heart tonight is that men and women make themselves
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:12.520]   the center.
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:13.520]   God?
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:14.520]   What's God?
[00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:17.400]   Well, God's somebody I can turn to if I'm very ill, or my wife's ill, or my children
[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:20.720]   are ill, or if I happen to be shipwrecked in mid-Atlantic, and there's nobody near.
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:23.160]   I pray to God.
[00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:27.480]   Like the Titanic, you see, steaming across on the Sunday with the jazz band playing.
[00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:32.080]   And suddenly, it hits us an iceberg.
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:34.960]   This is the thing I always go on repeating.
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:38.500]   It's so true of the whole of human nature in sin.
[00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:44.560]   The same band that had just been playing the jazz music, when it knows that that unsinkable
[00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:53.760]   ship is sinking, begins to play, "Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee."
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:58.760]   Ah, you see, this is the whole cause of the trouble.
[00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:05.880]   Man becomes the center of everything, and God is forgotten, and that inevitably leads
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:11.160]   to trouble in the ways I've already indicated, and here are some further ways.
[00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:15.520]   The moment I've got a wrong view of myself, my whole view of life is going to be wrong.
[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:16.520]   What am I?
[00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:18.800]   What is man?
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:19.800]   What is life?
[00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:21.280]   What's the purpose of life?
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:26.240]   These are the fundamental questions, and men and women are living and behaving tonight
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:29.520]   in terms of what they answer to that question.
[00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:33.080]   As a man thinks, so he is.
[00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:37.800]   It's our view of ourselves that determines exactly how we are going to behave and how
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:39.680]   we are going to live.
[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:41.440]   What is a man?
[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:42.440]   That's the question.
[00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:48.240]   Well, you see, if you begin with this notion that man's the center of everything, and that
[00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:53.520]   what matters more than anything else is my happiness and my pleasure, you've already
[00:33:53.520 --> 00:34:01.760]   lost any hope of any peace or rest, but that is what's being done by men today.
[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:05.640]   He's got a wrong view of happiness.
[00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:07.840]   He puts it first.
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:12.920]   Happiness comes before everything, and the moment you put happiness in the first position,
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:13.920]   you're lost.
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:16.920]   You'll never get it.
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:20.400]   Happiness is not the first and the most important thing in life.
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:22.800]   Righteousness and truth are the first and the most important.
[00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:25.520]   You put happiness there, you'll never get it.
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:26.520]   Never.
[00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:27.520]   Why?
[00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:33.200]   Well, because happiness is always a byproduct to be true happiness.
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:35.320]   But modern men puts happiness at the center.
[00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:37.880]   Men in sin has always done that.
[00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:38.880]   He doesn't say, "Is this right?"
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:39.880]   He says, "Do I like it?
[00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:40.880]   Do I want it?"
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:44.740]   And the whole argument today is, if you do want a thing, it's all right.
[00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:47.540]   Don't listen to the mid-Victorians, don't listen to the Bible, don't believe anything
[00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:48.540]   about sin.
[00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:50.000]   You know, they've been trying to keep you down.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.520]   You're meant to have this sort of thing.
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:52.520]   You've got these things in you.
[00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:53.520]   Let yourself go, men.
[00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:54.520]   Don't hold yourself back.
[00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:55.520]   That's restraint.
[00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:56.520]   Don't do that.
[00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:57.520]   Isn't that it?
[00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:58.520]   Self-expression.
[00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:02.320]   So your morals are thrown out the window, and you spit on them after you've thrown them
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:04.680]   out.
[00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:06.400]   But the question is, do you find peace?
[00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:10.300]   Do you find rest?
[00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:13.920]   Because you see, not only does sin make us put happiness in the wrong position, it makes
[00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:19.280]   us seek happiness in the wrong ways.
[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:22.360]   What the Bible calls "broken systems."
[00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:24.000]   The world is full of broken systems.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.360]   A great city like London, of course, is full of them.
[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:30.360]   Gaudy advertisements come in here, "Do you want happiness?
[00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:31.360]   Here's the way.
[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:32.360]   Come along.
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:33.360]   You'll get it so cheaply.
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:34.360]   You'll get it at once.
[00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:35.360]   Happiness!"
[00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:36.360]   Your conscience says, "Wait a minute.
[00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:37.360]   Pick it up."
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:38.360]   What's conscience?
[00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:39.360]   That's just some throwback that's in me.
[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:40.960]   That's something I dismiss psychologically.
[00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:41.960]   "Here, I can get it.
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:42.960]   Look at it.
[00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:43.960]   It's all glittering.
[00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:44.960]   Marvelous!"
[00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:48.960]   In you go to find happiness.
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:55.840]   What you find is misery, broken systems.
[00:35:55.840 --> 00:36:00.760]   Because you see, the world's way of giving us what it calls peace and happiness is always
[00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:05.800]   the sinful way, and that always leads to remorse.
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:09.020]   That always leads to unhappiness.
[00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:14.080]   That always leads to a sense of shame and a sense of failure, and you're more restless
[00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:15.480]   than you ever were before.
[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:19.880]   Oh, let me sum it up in the words that you're all anticipating, I'm sure.
[00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:24.200]   The words of a man who tried all this more thoroughly, perhaps, than most people, with
[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:30.520]   his brilliant mind, that genius who became known later and still is known as the great
[00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:33.720]   Saint Augustine.
[00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:36.720]   He looked for happiness.
[00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:41.720]   With his brilliant intellect, he kept his mistress, but he couldn't find peace.
[00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:44.720]   At last, it comes, the inevitable.
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:51.600]   Thou hast made us for thyself, and our souls are restless until they find their rest in
[00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:52.600]   thee.
[00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:53.600]   He'd seen it.
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:55.480]   The Bible has told us this from the beginning.
[00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:57.440]   The way of the transgressor is hard.
[00:36:57.440 --> 00:37:04.160]   There is no peace, says my God to the wicked, because God is God and this is his world,
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:09.280]   and I am made in the image of God, whatever I may think or do with myself.
[00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:14.000]   These are ultimate, eternal facts, and you're only flying in the face of them when you try
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.880]   to avoid them or to forget them.
[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:20.960]   It's like that restless sea hurling itself against a rock, only to be thrown back, and
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:26.440]   the more it does it, the more mud and mar it creates, and on it goes in its eternal
[00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:28.120]   restlessness.
[00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:33.600]   Religion always does that, and then, you see, it leads to wrong attitude to other people.
[00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:39.600]   If I'm the center of the universe, and my good pleasure and my happiness is the supreme
[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:43.440]   thing, well, you know, I'll never find it for this reason that everybody else says the
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:48.600]   same thing about himself and herself.
[00:37:48.600 --> 00:38:02.680]   With all your quarreling, and so, fighting, with looks, with lips, in writing, in engineering
[00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:08.600]   things behind people's backs, it's all because I'm first, and everybody else is saying the
[00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:14.120]   same thing, and nations are doing this.
[00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:19.480]   If self is made the center, if man is made the center, if my happiness is the supreme
[00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:21.480]   thing, you're bound to have jealousy.
[00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:22.480]   You can't help it.
[00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:23.920]   You're bound to have envy.
[00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:25.600]   You're bound to have malice.
[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:27.360]   You're bound to have nationalism.
[00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:29.280]   You're bound to have hatred.
[00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:32.200]   You're bound to have color bars.
[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:34.200]   You're bound to have war.
[00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:36.040]   These are the causes of all these things.
[00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:42.760]   It all comes back to this simple thing, sin in man, the fall, estrangement from God, man's
[00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:48.200]   false view of himself, as well as his false view of God.
[00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:53.320]   The apostles described it perfectly in that second chapter of the epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:59.560]   The ancient world was divided Jew, Gentile, and they hated one another, despised one another,
[00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:05.320]   fought one another, and whatever they might do, they couldn't find peace with one another.
[00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:08.200]   No, no, the Bible's quite clear.
[00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:09.600]   How has it all come about?
[00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:11.880]   What's the thing that keeps all this going?
[00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:14.200]   Why can't education deliver us from all of this?
[00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:15.680]   I'll tell you why.
[00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:23.880]   The devil, "Yeweth he quickened that were dead in trespasses and sins," listen, "wherein
[00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:29.400]   in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of
[00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:35.200]   the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience."
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:37.280]   It's all really as simple as that.
[00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:40.280]   God made the world, made it paradise, and it was glorious.
[00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:45.440]   He looked on it and saw it was good, and the devil, who'd already rebelled against him,
[00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:46.440]   he hates this.
[00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:50.360]   He says, "I'm going to ruin it, I'm going to smash it, I'm going to turn it into discord
[00:39:50.360 --> 00:40:01.080]   and fighting and war and lust and disease," and he keeps it going, and his brilliance
[00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:07.280]   is being revealed more clearly than ever in this modern world in which you and I are living.
[00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:15.000]   Well, my dear friends, that's why the world needs peace.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:19.640]   And I can put my next point like this, if you like, and that is why also it is the gospel
[00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:24.360]   alone that can give peace.
[00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:30.640]   That's why I stand in this pulpit Sunday by Sunday, I'm here, a messenger, announcing
[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:37.880]   the gospel of peace, and it's the only way of peace.
[00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:42.320]   There is nothing else in the universe tonight that can give you peace but this.
[00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:45.480]   "What about your other religions?" says someone.
[00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:49.760]   Well, all I say to you is, "Try them if you like."
[00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:54.800]   They're all pessimistic, profoundly pessimistic.
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:59.280]   In the last analysis, they tell you that you can't find peace in this world.
[00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:03.680]   Some of them will tell you that your only hope is to go on being reincarnated time and
[00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:04.680]   time again.
[00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:08.680]   You may come back as an animal next time, and you'll gradually purge away your sin
[00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:13.400]   and your misery, and perhaps at the end you'll arrive at some nirvana.
[00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:20.920]   And others, by some similar process, tell you your only hope is to be absorbed into
[00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:23.200]   the absolute.
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:28.120]   In any case, they all say that the flesh is hopeless, and while you're in the flesh,
[00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:29.500]   there is no hope for you at all.
[00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:33.360]   They're all profoundly pessimistic.
[00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:40.440]   And not only do your world religions fail to give you peace, all your modern teachings
[00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:41.440]   fail equally.
[00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:45.860]   None of them know the answers.
[00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:49.920]   Your modern psychology, what peace does that give you?
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:54.840]   It doesn't even give the psychologists peace.
[00:41:54.840 --> 00:42:00.320]   They're always having to fall back on some mechanical method, electric shock, or insulin
[00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:02.680]   shock, or new drugs now.
[00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:05.760]   This is a sheer confession of failure.
[00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:06.760]   They can't do it.
[00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:11.280]   The only hope is, they say, to knock out the brain in some shape or form, shock it out
[00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:13.740]   of it, or drag it out of it, as it were.
[00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:16.720]   Well, it's all right, there's nothing new in that.
[00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:20.720]   Men used to do that by drinking alcohol, they now do it by taking tranquilizers.
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:23.240]   Same thing, same effect.
[00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:25.840]   More controlled, I agree, but same in principle.
[00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:32.640]   No, no, there's only one thing in the universe tonight that can give a man peace and rest.
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:34.000]   It's this blessed gospel.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   Why?
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:40.240]   Well, haven't I been showing you why, aren't you there before me?
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:48.400]   It is the gospel alone that can deal with the cause of my loss of peace.
[00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:52.420]   I sometimes am tempted to say that any man who preaches the gospel should be compelled
[00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:56.840]   to do a medical cause first.
[00:42:56.840 --> 00:43:01.640]   The trouble with so many people today who are offering us their nostrums is that they've
[00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:06.080]   never realized that before you begin to treat, you must make a diagnosis.
[00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:09.640]   You can't run into treatment before you know the cause of the trouble, and if the cause
[00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:15.000]   of the trouble is man's wrong relationship to God, man's sin against God, well then,
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:20.520]   do what you will, you'll never find peace until that has been put right, and this alone
[00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:24.580]   can put that right.
[00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:30.440]   And that was the whole purpose of the coming of the Son of God into this world.
[00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:35.960]   The Son of Man is come, he says, to seek and to save that which is lost.
[00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:37.880]   Why did God send his Son into the world?
[00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:42.160]   I say it is because he's the God of peace.
[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:47.040]   He sent his Son into the world in order that through him he might reconcile the world unto
[00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:48.040]   himself.
[00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:55.440]   God was, in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses
[00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:56.440]   unto him.
[00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:58.360]   It's the only way in which it can be done.
[00:43:58.360 --> 00:43:59.360]   I don't keep you with that.
[00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:02.080]   We've already considered it on previous Sunday evenings.
[00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:04.900]   That's the whole meaning of the cross on Calvary's hill.
[00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:10.160]   The apostle has put it to us, you remember, here in this tremendous statement in this
[00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:17.440]   second chapter of his epistle to the Ephesians, "But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:23.120]   were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ.
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:28.480]   For he is our peace, who hath made both one and hath broken down the middle wall of partition
[00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:34.320]   between us, having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained
[00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:40.800]   in ordinances, for to make in himself a twain one new man, so making peace, and that he
[00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:53.080]   might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby."
[00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:58.040]   This is the only way whereby a man can ever find peace with God.
[00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:06.800]   "Now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are brought nigh by the blood of Christ."
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:12.400]   My dear friends, here's the very heart and nerve of the gospel of peace.
[00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:17.840]   There is enmity between God and men, and men and God, and it's all the result of sin,
[00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:23.040]   and it must be dealt with, and there alone it is dealt with.
[00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:29.960]   God makes peace with us by punishing our sins in the person of his only begotten Son on
[00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:33.440]   the cross on Calvary's hill.
[00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:38.000]   He has made peace by the blood of his cross.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.360]   It's the only way.
[00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:46.960]   If while we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, that's it,
[00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:51.440]   by the blood of Christ, it's the only way.
[00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:58.360]   Here man's sin is dealt with, it's punished, therefore God forgives us freely.
[00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:03.280]   We are reconciled to God, we are restored into fellowship with God.
[00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:07.800]   Peace is possible, and on top of it, as we saw last Sunday night, we are even given a
[00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:09.920]   new nature.
[00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:16.880]   The effects of sin upon us, which have ruined our natures, is dealt with by the rebirth,
[00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:23.600]   the new generation, the new heart, the new mind, the new understanding, the new everything.
[00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:28.480]   You see, this is the way the gospel makes peace.
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:31.120]   It's so unlike the way of the world.
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:36.200]   The world says this, doesn't it, "Put an end to war and you'll have peace.
[00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:39.000]   Get rid of that person who's troubling you, you'll get peace.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:43.920]   Move this or that, deal with the circumstances, pass Acts of Parliament, put the world right,
[00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:46.520]   then we'll all enjoy peace."
[00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:49.160]   And it's been trying to do it now for many centuries, hasn't it?
[00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:51.380]   That's the whole story of civilization.
[00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:55.040]   But it's no nearer to it than it was at the beginning, and it never will be.
[00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:57.760]   How does the gospel give peace, I'll tell you?
[00:46:57.760 --> 00:46:59.320]   This is the whole mystery.
[00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:00.680]   Here's another mystery.
[00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:04.320]   We might have called this, again, another aspect of the mystery of the gospel.
[00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:08.320]   Here's the secret of the gospel.
[00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:14.000]   The gospel gives you peace in this world, not by changing the world, but by changing
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   you.
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:18.040]   That's the wonder and the amazement of it.
[00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:22.480]   Peace, perfect peace in this dark world of sin, and all the other questions that you
[00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:29.840]   asked and sang, with loved ones far away, with wars and all, peace possible, certainly.
[00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:33.400]   Peace is something within.
[00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:39.400]   It doesn't change the world, it changes you, so that in the world as it is, you may
[00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:41.080]   have perfect peace.
[00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:42.080]   What is this peace?
[00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:43.080]   What are the results?
[00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:44.080]   Let me show you.
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:51.700]   "Being justified by faith," says Paul to the Romans, "we have peace with God through
[00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:55.640]   our Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:47:55.640 --> 00:48:00.680]   You believe this message and you'll have peace with God.
[00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:05.840]   You'll no longer be afraid of God, with that craven fear, the fear that hath torment.
[00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:08.320]   You know, you believe this gospel.
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:14.240]   You will know that God, the Almighty God, is your Father.
[00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:16.620]   You've often said your prayers, haven't you?
[00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:18.400]   Have you ever realized what you've said?
[00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:23.600]   You get on your knees and you say, "Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name!"
[00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:29.040]   But you realize what you're saying, you're saying, "My Father."
[00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:32.940]   Did you know that God is your Father?
[00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:35.040]   This is the way to get peace, my dear friend.
[00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:40.320]   We are all, you know, like little buyers, frightened in this world.
[00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:45.380]   We walk away from home, suddenly we see a great bully approaching us and we are terrified.
[00:48:45.380 --> 00:48:47.760]   We are so small and we are so weak and helpless.
[00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:48.760]   What can we do?
[00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:52.680]   Suddenly, our Father appears and all is well.
[00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:57.960]   You and I are in this great, mysterious universe and above all these problems pressing heavily
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:07.360]   upon us, there's only one way of peace, it's to know our Father, the Lord of the universe.
[00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:13.640]   You not only know him, you can go and speak to him because you know that he's for you
[00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:16.440]   and not against you.
[00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:18.400]   He's given you proof that he's for you.
[00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:22.200]   He sent his only son into the world to save you and to give you peace.
[00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:24.960]   If he's done that for you, he'll refuse you nothing.
[00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:28.800]   If while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his son, how much more
[00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:32.000]   being reconciled shall we be saved by his life?
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:36.360]   He that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not also with
[00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:42.120]   him freely give us all things?
[00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:46.360]   The hairs of your head are all numbered, says Christ.
[00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:51.600]   The hairs of your head are all numbered, your Father knows all about you.
[00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:55.720]   Do you know, my friend, when you know a thing like that, you've got peace, because you've
[00:49:55.720 --> 00:50:00.920]   got peace with God, but not only that, he gives you peace within.
[00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:06.920]   The moment you believe this message, the moment you have a new birth and a new nature, you
[00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:09.520]   get a right view of yourself.
[00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:13.520]   You realize that you are your own greatest enemy and that it's your own selfishness and
[00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:17.120]   self-centeredness that has produced most of your problems.
[00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:20.800]   Most of the things that have kept you awake at night have been entirely due to your own
[00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:26.880]   self, your self-aggrandizement, the desire for self-aggrandizement, this self-adulation,
[00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:29.840]   this self-protection, this self-sensitivity.
[00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:37.440]   You see it all and you get rid of it, you hate yourself.
[00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:40.600]   You've lost your life and you've gained a new one.
[00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:43.360]   You've got new life within.
[00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:46.220]   You've got a new conception of what it means to be a man.
[00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:50.040]   You've got a new idea as to what life is about and what its purpose is.
[00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:54.800]   You've got new hopes, you've got new joys, you've got new satisfactions.
[00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:55.800]   This isn't theory.
[00:50:55.800 --> 00:51:02.280]   Thank God, unworthy as I am, I'm able to tell you this is true.
[00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:07.960]   This is what the Gospel does.
[00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:12.340]   Not only that, it helps you to see other people are right, the people you used to be jealous
[00:51:12.340 --> 00:51:16.840]   of and envious of and felt that they were jealous and unfair to you and you hated them
[00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:18.040]   and you did this and that.
[00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:20.800]   You know, once you are changed, you'll see them differently.
[00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:21.800]   You know what happens?
[00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:24.200]   You'll begin to feel sorry for them.
[00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:29.160]   You'll see that they are still the victims of the devil and sin as you once were and
[00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:30.800]   you'll begin to pray for them.
[00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:34.320]   You'll begin to pray to God to have mercy upon them and change them also.
[00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:38.880]   You see, what the Gospel does is to make of twain these with a middle wall of partition
[00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:40.080]   between them.
[00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:44.400]   We get so excited in talking about our iron curtains and our bamboo curtains.
[00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:51.920]   Here was the curtain, middle wall of partition, Jew and Gentile enmity, bitterness.
[00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:57.220]   It's been demolished in Christ and Jew and Gentile are worshipping together in the Church
[00:51:57.220 --> 00:51:58.220]   of God.
[00:51:58.220 --> 00:52:03.360]   They go by, through Him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.
[00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:07.240]   And the Gentile is no more a stranger and a foreigner, but a fellow citizen with the
[00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:09.600]   saints and of the household of God.
[00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:14.920]   You understand other men and you begin to love them and you pray that they may be changed.
[00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:19.680]   You look at them as Christ looked at you and as he still looks at them.
[00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:24.360]   That's how peace comes, and wonderfully.
[00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:34.520]   You find that you've got a peace that persists and lasts in spite of circumstances.
[00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:39.560]   I've already quoted you from Paul in Romans 5, being justified by faith we have peace
[00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:44.880]   with God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we have access by faith into this
[00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:48.280]   grace wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.
[00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:54.360]   Listen to this, "And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also."
[00:52:54.360 --> 00:53:00.440]   We glory in tribulations, they're there, they're not taken away.
[00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:05.880]   We glory in the tribulations, in spite of them.
[00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:08.160]   And this is the wonderful thing about this gospel.
[00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:13.360]   The apostle keeps on saying this, listen to him, be careful, be over-anxious, he says,
[00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:14.360]   for nothing.
[00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:20.560]   "But in everything, by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your requests be made
[00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:25.520]   known unto God, and the peace of God that passeth all understanding shall keep your
[00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:29.920]   hearts and minds through Christ Jesus."
[00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:35.400]   I don't care what your circumstances are, I don't care what they are, in nothing be
[00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:36.760]   anxious.
[00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:37.760]   Nothing at all.
[00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:38.760]   Doesn't matter what.
[00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:39.760]   "Ah, but you say you don't know my..."
[00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:41.600]   I don't care what your circumstances are.
[00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:49.600]   In nothing be anxious, but in all things with prayer and supplication and thanksgiving,
[00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:58.040]   let your requests be made known unto God, and the peace of God which passeth all understanding
[00:53:58.040 --> 00:54:03.480]   shall keep your heart and mind, though the circumstances remain exactly what they were,
[00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:06.520]   your heart and mind will be at perfect rest and peace.
[00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:10.840]   So that Paul is able to say later on in the same fourth chapter of Philippians, not that
[00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:16.720]   I speak in respect of want, for I have learned in whatsoever state I am, therein to be content.
[00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:22.160]   I know both how to be abased and how to abound everywhere, and in all things I am instructed
[00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:25.920]   both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.
[00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:32.520]   I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me.
[00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:38.280]   In spite of circumstances, the peace remains and abides.
[00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:44.880]   Even with the prospect of death staring you in the face.
[00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:49.560]   This is the testimony of these wonderful people, these missionaries that have recently been
[00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:52.840]   killed in the Congo, and others who have been set at liberty.
[00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:56.080]   With death facing them, they have perfect peace.
[00:54:56.080 --> 00:54:57.080]   Why?
[00:54:57.080 --> 00:55:01.480]   Well, you see, again the answer I have given to you.
[00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:09.800]   Being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ and by him
[00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:15.400]   also have access into this grace wherein we stand—that's prayer, listen—and rejoice
[00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:20.680]   in hope of the glory of God.
[00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:25.960]   Once you've had a glimpse of heaven, this world can never make you lose your peace.
[00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:31.520]   Because you know that you don't go out into outer darkness and endless misery and remorse,
[00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:36.800]   but to the glory of God and of him, if you have but a glimmer of it, you'll never lose
[00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:39.280]   your peace again, even in the face of death.
[00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:43.840]   You'll rather say with this apostle Paul, "To me, to live is Christ, and to die is
[00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:44.840]   gain."
[00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:45.840]   Why?
[00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:52.160]   Well, because dying means to be with Christ, which is far better.
[00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:53.520]   Are you frightened?
[00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:54.800]   Are you afraid of life?
[00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:56.080]   Are you afraid of death?
[00:55:56.080 --> 00:56:02.320]   Well, listen to the blessed words of this Son of God, this Prince of Peace, "Let not
[00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:05.440]   your heart be troubled.
[00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:09.560]   You believe in God, believe also in me.
[00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:12.640]   In my Father's house are many mansions.
[00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:16.520]   If it were not so, I would have told you.
[00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:21.600]   I go to prepare a place for you, and if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come
[00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:27.960]   again and receive you unto myself, that where I am, there ye may be also."
[00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:30.640]   What more do you want?
[00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:32.440]   He guarantees that for you.
[00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:36.880]   "Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.
[00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:39.560]   Peace I give unto you, peace I leave with you.
[00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:43.680]   My peace I give unto you, not as the world giveth.
[00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:50.280]   If I enter you, let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid."
[00:56:50.280 --> 00:57:02.240]   Listen, sister Paul, I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities
[00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:08.680]   and powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other
[00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:19.880]   creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus
[00:57:19.880 --> 00:57:21.800]   our Lord.
[00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:26.200]   My friend, the question I ask you as I close is this.
[00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:27.440]   Have you got this peace?
[00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:36.000]   Have you got a heart at rest, or are you utterly dependent upon the world, and upon men and
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:40.240]   women, and things that happen to you, and money, and all the rest of it?
[00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:45.240]   If you are, you have not got peace, because the day will come in your history as in mine,
[00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:53.300]   when you will be without all these things, you will just be a soul naked, facing God
[00:57:53.300 --> 00:57:56.640]   and eternity.
[00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:59.240]   Have you got this peace?
[00:57:59.240 --> 00:58:04.640]   This is the peace that the gospel offers.
[00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:10.240]   Have you ever prayed that first hymn we sang tonight really from your heart, "Guide me,
[00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:18.320]   O thou great Jehovah, pilgrim" - that's all you are - "in this barren land?"
[00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:21.560]   I am weak, have you realized it?
[00:58:21.560 --> 00:58:30.760]   But thou art mighty, hold me with thy powerful hand, bread of heaven, feed me now and evermore.
[00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:36.240]   When I tread the verge of Jordan, you'll have to, you're bound to, we've all got to.
[00:58:36.240 --> 00:58:41.840]   When I tread, when your feet just begin to get into the river, when I tread the verge
[00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:47.040]   of Jordan, bid my anxious fears subside.
[00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:53.840]   Death of death and hell's destruction, land me safe on Canaan's side.
[00:58:53.840 --> 00:58:58.520]   He can do it, but do you know that he can do it?
[00:58:58.520 --> 00:59:05.440]   You'll never have peace until you know that he can, believe in him.
[00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:14.320]   God sent his son into the world to give us this peace, a peace which the world cannot
[00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:19.320]   only not give us, it can never take it from us.
[00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:25.160]   It's a peace in spite of everything, hell included.
[00:59:25.160 --> 00:59:33.640]   It is the peace of God that passeth all understanding.
[00:59:33.640 --> 00:59:57.120]   Blessed be the name of God for sending to us the gospel of peace through the Prince
[00:59:57.120 --> 01:00:23.040]   of Peace.
[01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:27.880]   Amen.
[01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:37.880]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
