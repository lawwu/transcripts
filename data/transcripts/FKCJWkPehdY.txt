[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200]   The following is a conversation with Joe Rogan
[00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.720]   that we recorded after my recent appearance
[00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.920]   on his podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience.
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.480]   Joe has been an inspiration to me
[00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.560]   and I thank to millions of people
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.640]   for just being somebody who puts love out there in the world
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.920]   and being genuinely curious about wild ideas
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.800]   from chimps and psychedelics to quantum mechanics
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.800]   and artificial intelligence.
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.620]   Like many of you, I've been a fan of his podcast
[00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:34.620]   for over a decade and now, somehow, miraculously,
[00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.400]   am humbled to be able to call him a friend.

[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.100]   but this time, let's go straight to the conversation
[00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.240]   with a bit of guitar first.
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.900]   (guitar music)
[00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.480]   (guitar music)
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.060]   (guitar music)
[00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:34.640]   (guitar music)
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.740]   (guitar music)
[00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:47.180]   (guitar music)
[00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.760]   (guitar music)
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:56.140]   - Do you ponder your mortality?
[00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.860]   Are you afraid of death?
[00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.480]   - I do think about it sometimes.
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.780]   I mean, it does pop into my head sometimes,
[00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.940]   just the fact that, I mean, I'm 53,
[00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.940]   so if everything goes great, I have less than 50 years left.
[00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.540]   You know, if everything goes great,
[00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.580]   like no car accidents, no injuries.
[00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:16.860]   - But it could happen today.
[00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.220]   This could be your last day.
[00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.140]   - Could be.
[00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.300]   - That's kind of a stoic thing to meditate on death.
[00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.020]   There's a bunch of philosophers,
[00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.460]   Ernest Becker and Sheldon Solomon.
[00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.460]   They believe that death is at the core of everything.
[00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.300]   Wrote this book, Warm at the Core.
[00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.260]   So does that come into play in the way you see the world?
[00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.500]   - I think having a sense of urgency is very beneficial
[00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.520]   and understanding that your time is limited
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.940]   can aid you greatly.
[00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.260]   I think knowing that this is a temporary time,
[00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.420]   that we have finite lifespans,
[00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.580]   I think there's great power in that
[00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.580]   because it motivates you, it gets you going.
[00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.180]   I think being an immortal, living forever,
[00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.740]   would be one of the most depressing things,
[00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.140]   particularly if everybody else was dying around you.
[00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.160]   And I think one of the things that makes life
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.340]   so interesting and fascinating is that it doesn't last.
[00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.860]   You know, that you really get a brief amount of time,
[00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.220]   here and really by the time you're just starting
[00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.980]   to kind of figure yourself out, who you are
[00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.500]   and how not to screw things up so bad, like time's up.
[00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.660]   - The ride's over.
[00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.820]   What about from your daughter's perspective?
[00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.940]   Do you think about the world we're in now
[00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.300]   and what kind of world you're gonna leave them?
[00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.140]   - I do.
[00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.960]   - And do you worry about it?
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.580]   - I do, yeah, I do.
[00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.760]   I do when I see these protests and riots and chaos
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.760]   and so much anger in the world today.
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.420]   And then particularly today, I think,
[00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.380]   because of the pandemic and the fact that so many folks
[00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.220]   are out of work and through no fault of their own
[00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.600]   and can't make ends meet and just people feel so helpless
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.600]   and angry, it's a particularly divisive time.
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.420]   It's a particularly turmoil-filled time.
[00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.920]   And it just doesn't seem like the world of a year ago,
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.620]   even, just feels very chaotic and dangerous.
[00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.780]   And it's a small thing, like in terms of the possibilities
[00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.180]   of things that could happen to the world,
[00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.460]   like a pandemic, like the one we've experienced,
[00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.640]   it really just doubles the amount of deaths
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.040]   on a bad flu year.
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.980]   So it, relatively speaking, is a small thing
[00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.980]   in comparison to super volcano eruptions, asteroid impact,
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.200]   a real horrific pandemic, one that really wipes out
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.180]   millions and millions of people.
[00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.340]   It's stunning how fragile civility is.
[00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:55.020]   It's stunning how fragile our society really is,
[00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.000]   that something like this can come along,
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.060]   some unprecedented thing can come along
[00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.280]   and all of a sudden everybody's out of work for six months.
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.000]   And then everybody's at each other's throats.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.220]   And then politically, everyone's at each other's throats.
[00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.240]   And then with the advent of social media
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.600]   and the images that you can see,
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.360]   with the videos of police abuse and just racial tensions
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.700]   are at an all time high, to a point where like,
[00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.080]   if you asked me just five or six years ago,
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.160]   like, have racial problems in this country
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.640]   largely been alleviated?
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.040]   I'd probably say, yeah, it's way better
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.280]   than it's ever been before.
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.820]   But now you could argue that it's not.
[00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.520]   Now you could argue, no, it's way worse
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.580]   in just a small amount of time.
[00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.760]   It's way worse than it's ever been during my lifetime.
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.680]   While I'm aware of it,
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.480]   obviously when I was a young boy in the 60s,
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.960]   they were still going through the civil rights movement,
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.640]   but now it just seems very fever pitched.
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.760]   And I think a lot of that is because of the pandemic
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:58.380]   and is because of all the heightened, just tension.
[00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:03.380]   The one I liken it to is road rage.
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.440]   'Cause people have road rage,
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:06.840]   not just because they're in the car
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.120]   and no one can get to them,
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.560]   but also because you're at a heightened state
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.000]   because you're driving fast
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.120]   and you know you're driving fast.
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.960]   You know you have to make split second movements.
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.540]   And so anybody doing something, you're like, what the?
[00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:21.160]   People go crazy because they're already at an eight
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.540]   because they're in the car and they're moving very quickly.
[00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:26.120]   That's what it feels like with today, with the pandemic.
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.680]   It feels like everybody is already at an eight.
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.560]   So anything that comes along, it's like,
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.120]   light it all on fire, burn it down.
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.720]   Like that's part of what I think is part of the reason
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.680]   for a lot of the looting and the riots and all the chaos.
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.120]   It's not just the people out of work,
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:45.840]   but it's also that everyone feels so tense already
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.920]   and everyone feels so helpless.
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.420]   And it's like, you know, doing something like that
[00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:54.020]   makes people, it just,
[00:06:54.020 --> 00:07:00.560]   it gives people a whole new motivation for chaos,
[00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:05.140]   a whole new motivation for doing destructive things
[00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:07.360]   that I've never experienced in my life.
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.660]   - And your better days, when you see a positive future,
[00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:15.220]   what do you think is the way out of this chaos of 2020?
[00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:18.060]   Like if you visualize a 2025,
[00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:19.700]   that's a better world than today.
[00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.300]   What does that, how do we get there
[00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:22.340]   and what does that look like?
[00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:23.540]   - It's a good question.
[00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:29.300]   I can honestly say I don't know.
[00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:32.620]   And I wouldn't have said I don't know a year ago.
[00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:34.860]   A year ago, I would have said, we're gonna be okay.
[00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:37.980]   As much as people hate Trump, the economy's doing great.
[00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:39.340]   I think we're gonna be fine.
[00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:41.220]   That's not how I feel today.
[00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:45.700]   Today, I don't think there's a clear solution politically
[00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:48.540]   'cause I think if Trump wins, people are gonna be furious.
[00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:51.300]   And I think if Biden wins, people are gonna be furious.
[00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:55.780]   Particularly like if things get more woke, you know,
[00:07:55.780 --> 00:08:00.780]   if people continue to enforce this, force compliance
[00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:03.660]   and make people behave a certain way
[00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:05.340]   and act a certain way, which seems to be a part
[00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:06.860]   of what this whole woke thing is,
[00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:09.500]   that is the most disturbing for me
[00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:10.920]   is that I see what's going on.
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:14.900]   I see there's a lot of losers that have hopped on this
[00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.060]   and they shove it in people's faces
[00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:18.140]   and it doesn't have to make sense.
[00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:20.300]   Like there was a Black Lives Matter protest
[00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:23.340]   that stopped this woman at a restaurant.
[00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:25.220]   They were surrounding her outside a restaurant
[00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:28.500]   and they were forcing her to raise her fist in compliance.
[00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:32.500]   This is a woman who's marched for Black Lives Matter
[00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:34.740]   multiple times and the people around her doing this
[00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:35.700]   were all white.
[00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:37.140]   - Yeah. - It's all weird.
[00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:39.140]   My friend, Coach T, he's a wrestling coach,
[00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:42.460]   is also on a podcast, my friend, Brian Moses.
[00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:45.100]   His take on it is that Black, and he's a Black guy,
[00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:47.100]   he says, "Black Lives Matter is a white cult."
[00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:48.060]   (laughing)
[00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:49.900]   And I'm like, when you see that picture,
[00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:52.260]   it's hard to argue that he's got a point.
[00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260]   I mean, it's clearly not all about that,
[00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.580]   but there's a lot of people that have jumped on board
[00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:00.740]   that are very much like cult members.
[00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:03.020]   Because the thing about Black Lives Matter
[00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:06.740]   or any movement is you can't control who joins.
[00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:10.500]   There's no entrance examination.
[00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.380]   So you don't go, okay, how do you feel about this?
[00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:13.660]   What's your perceptions on that?
[00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:18.300]   Like the man who shot the Trump supporter in Portland,
[00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:20.260]   you know, that guy who murdered the Trump supporter
[00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:21.580]   then the cop shot him?
[00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:25.780]   That guy was walking around with his hand on his gun
[00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:27.500]   looking for Trump supporters.
[00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:31.500]   Just want, I mean, he's a known violent guy
[00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.460]   who was walking around looking for Trump supporters,
[00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:34.780]   found one and shot one.
[00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:36.900]   That has nothing to do with Black Lives Matter.
[00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:38.380]   He's a white guy, he shot another white guy.
[00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:40.660]   It's just madness, you know?
[00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:42.940]   And that kind of madness is,
[00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:47.380]   it's disturbing to see it ramp up so quickly.
[00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:51.340]   I mean, there's been riots in Portland every night.
[00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:55.020]   Oh, excuse me, demonstrations for 101 days now.
[00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:57.780]   101 days in a row of them lighting things on fire,
[00:09:57.780 --> 00:09:59.820]   breaking into federal buildings.
[00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:02.460]   It's like, whoever saw that coming?
[00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:03.380]   Nobody saw that coming.
[00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:07.300]   So I don't know what the solution is
[00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:09.340]   and I don't know what it looks like in five years.
[00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:12.220]   So 2025, to answer your question, like,
[00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:13.060]   it could be anything.
[00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:14.740]   I mean, we could be looking at Mad Max.
[00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:16.700]   We could be looking at the apocalypse.
[00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.620]   We could also be looking at an invasion
[00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:20.460]   from another country.
[00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:23.620]   We could be looking at a war, like a real hot war.
[00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:27.260]   - To put a little bit of responsibility on you,
[00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:28.820]   like, for me, I've listened to you
[00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:31.540]   since the Red Band Olive Garden days,
[00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:33.260]   that's the very beginning.
[00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.340]   And there was something in the way
[00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:36.740]   you communicated about the world.
[00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:37.580]   Maybe there was others,
[00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:39.580]   but you were the one I was aware of,
[00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:44.180]   is you were open-minded and loving towards the world,
[00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:45.780]   especially as the podcast developed.
[00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:49.700]   Like, you just demonstrated and lived
[00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:51.660]   this kind of just kindness,
[00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:53.740]   or maybe even like lack of jealousy
[00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:55.860]   in your own little profession of comedy.
[00:10:55.860 --> 00:11:00.060]   It was clear that you didn't succumb
[00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:02.060]   to the weaker aspects of human nature
[00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:04.300]   and thereby inspire people like me,
[00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:09.300]   who I was naturally, probably especially in the 20s,
[00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:12.540]   early 20s, kind of jealous of the success of others.
[00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:15.060]   And you're really the primary person
[00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:19.900]   that taught me to truly celebrate the success of others.
[00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:23.220]   And so by way of question,
[00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:25.060]   you kind of have a role in this,
[00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:26.660]   of making a better 2025.
[00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:27.860]   You have such a big megaphone.
[00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:31.820]   Is there something you think you can do on this podcast
[00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:34.980]   with the words, the way you talk,
[00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:39.540]   the things you discuss that could create a better 2025?
[00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:44.460]   - I think if anything, I could help in leading by example,
[00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:49.180]   but that's only gonna help the people that are listening.
[00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:52.340]   I don't know what else I can do
[00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:54.180]   in terms of like make the world a better place
[00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:59.180]   other than express my hopes and wishes for that
[00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:02.540]   and just try to be as nice as I can to people
[00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:04.220]   as often as I can.
[00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:07.060]   But I also think that I've fallen into this weird category,
[00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.740]   particularly with the Spotify deal,
[00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:12.940]   where I'm one of them now.
[00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:14.980]   I'm not a regular person anymore.
[00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:18.620]   Now I'm like some famous rich guy.
[00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:20.300]   So you go from being a regular person
[00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:22.980]   to a famous rich guy that's out of touch.
[00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:26.020]   And that's a real issue
[00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:28.620]   whenever you're talking about the economy,
[00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:30.940]   about just real life problems.
[00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:32.020]   - It's interesting.
[00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:33.780]   It kind of hurts my heart to hear people say
[00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:36.460]   about Elon Musk, he's just a billionaire.
[00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:38.460]   It's an interesting statement,
[00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:41.140]   but I think if you just continue being you
[00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:42.940]   and he continued being him,
[00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:47.980]   I think people are just voicing their worry
[00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:49.620]   that you become some rich guy.
[00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:51.620]   - I don't even know if they're doing that.
[00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:53.700]   I think they're just finding,
[00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:56.300]   the way he describes it, an attack vector.
[00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:57.140]   - Right.
[00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:58.220]   - Yeah, and I think he's right.
[00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:01.580]   I think they can dismiss you by just saying,
[00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:03.380]   oh, you're just a that.
[00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:08.780]   You're easily definable.
[00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:09.620]   - Right.
[00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:10.980]   I mean, there's truth to that.
[00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:14.020]   If you're not careful, you can become out of touch.
[00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:17.260]   But that's an interesting thing.
[00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.420]   Why haven't you become out of touch?
[00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:21.740]   As a human off the podcast,
[00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:26.580]   you talk to somebody like me.
[00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:28.780]   You don't talk like a famous person
[00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:31.340]   or you don't act rich.
[00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:32.420]   (Lex laughing)
[00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:33.700]   Like you're better than others.
[00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:37.260]   There's a certain, listen, I've talked to quite a few.
[00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.940]   You have too, but I've talked to a special kind
[00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:41.940]   of group of people that are like Nobel Prize winners,
[00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:42.980]   let's say.
[00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:47.460]   They sometimes have an air to them that's of arrogance.
[00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:48.300]   And you don't.
[00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:49.340]   What's that about?
[00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:51.860]   - Well, you gotta know what that is, right?
[00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:54.340]   Like that air of arrogance comes
[00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:57.660]   from drinking your own Kool-Aid.
[00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:00.260]   You start believing that somehow or another,
[00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.060]   just because you're getting praise from all these people
[00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:04.500]   that you really are something different.
[00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:08.460]   Usually it exemplifies, there's something there
[00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:10.500]   where there's a lack of struggle.
[00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:15.420]   And I think struggle is probably
[00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:22.300]   one of the most important balancing tools
[00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:23.980]   that a person can have.
[00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:28.980]   And for me, I struggle mentally and I struggle physically.
[00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:31.940]   I struggle mentally in that, like we were talking about
[00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:34.340]   on the podcast we did previously,
[00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:37.780]   you and I on my podcast, that I'm not a fan of my work.
[00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:38.900]   I'm not a fan of what I do.
[00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:41.020]   I'm my harshest critic.
[00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:43.460]   So anytime anybody says something bad about me,
[00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:46.940]   I'm like, listen, I said way worse about myself.
[00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:50.020]   I don't like anything I do.
[00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:53.020]   I'm ruthlessly introspective
[00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:54.900]   and I will continue to be that way.
[00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:57.060]   'Cause that's the only way you can be good as a comedian.
[00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:57.940]   There's no other way.
[00:14:57.940 --> 00:14:59.900]   You can't just think you're awesome and just go out there.
[00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:03.020]   You have to be like picking apart everything you do.
[00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:04.220]   But there's a balance to that too,
[00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:05.460]   'cause you have to have enough confidence
[00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:06.780]   to go out there and perform.
[00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:08.500]   You can't think, oh my God, I suck.
[00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:10.300]   I know what I'm doing, but I know what I'm doing
[00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:11.580]   because I put in all that work.
[00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:13.380]   And one of the reasons why I put in all that work
[00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:17.500]   is I don't like the end result most of the time.
[00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:19.620]   So I need to work at it all the time.
[00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:21.300]   And then there's physical struggle,
[00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:23.940]   which I think balances everything out.
[00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:27.660]   Without physical struggle, I always make the analogy
[00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:30.700]   that the body is in a lot of ways like a battery,
[00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:33.220]   where if you have extra charge,
[00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:34.980]   it's like it leaks out of the top
[00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:37.580]   and it becomes unmanageable and messy.
[00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:39.220]   And that's how my psyche is.
[00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:41.540]   If I have too much energy,
[00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:46.420]   if I'm not exerting myself in a violent way,
[00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:49.940]   like an explosive way, like wearing myself out,
[00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:52.740]   I just don't like the way the world is.
[00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:54.620]   I don't like the way I interface with the world.
[00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:55.980]   I'm too tense.
[00:15:55.980 --> 00:16:00.420]   I'm too quick to be upset about things.
[00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:03.020]   But when I work out hard
[00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:07.180]   and I put in a brutal training session, everything's fine.
[00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:11.380]   - Well, the first time I talked to you, Jerry,
[00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:12.860]   you were doing October.
[00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:14.660]   - Sober October.
[00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:15.820]   - Sober October.
[00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:17.740]   And there's something in your eyes,
[00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:20.980]   like I think you've talked about that
[00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:22.980]   you exercise the demons out, essentially.
[00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:26.020]   So you exercise to get whatever the parts of you
[00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:27.900]   that you don't like out.
[00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:30.740]   There's a darkness in you there.
[00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:34.700]   Like the competitiveness and the focus of that person.
[00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:36.460]   - That was a scary time in a lot of ways,
[00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:38.060]   that Sober October thing.
[00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:41.460]   'Cause my friends, we were all talking shit, right?
[00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:43.380]   'Cause we're competing against each other
[00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:44.620]   in these fitness challenges.
[00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:48.500]   And you had one point,
[00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:50.340]   like you got a certain amount of points
[00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:54.540]   for each minute that you went at 80% of your max heart rate.
[00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:57.580]   And one day I got 1,100 points.
[00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:00.580]   So I did seven hours on an elliptical machine
[00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:03.620]   watching the bathhouse scene from John Wick,
[00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:05.060]   where he murders all those people in the bathhouse.
[00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:07.180]   I watched it probably 50 times in a row.
[00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:08.420]   I went crazy.
[00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:11.300]   I went crazy, but I went crazy in a weird way
[00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:16.100]   where it brought me back to my fighting days.
[00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:18.260]   It was like that person came out again.
[00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.340]   It was like, well, I didn't even know he was in there.
[00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:25.340]   It's like an assassin, like a killer.
[00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:30.940]   Like I felt like a different person.
[00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:34.100]   - Is it echoes of like what Mike Tyson talked about,
[00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:35.700]   essentially like the-
[00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:37.860]   - Maybe, but no orgasm notions.
[00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:39.380]   (laughing)
[00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:41.060]   All the crazy shit that he was saying.
[00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:44.020]   - Is there a violent person in there?
[00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:44.860]   - Oh yeah.
[00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:47.820]   Yeah, there's a lot of violence in me, for sure.
[00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:49.620]   I don't know if it's genetic or learned,
[00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:52.260]   or it's because during my formative years
[00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:55.060]   from the time I was 15 till I was 22,
[00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:56.740]   all I did was fight.
[00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:58.180]   That was all I did.
[00:17:58.180 --> 00:17:59.100]   That was all I did.
[00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:01.060]   All I did was train and compete.
[00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:01.900]   That's all I did.
[00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:03.060]   That was my whole life.
[00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:04.780]   - Is it connected to,
[00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:07.740]   so your mom and dad broke up early on.
[00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:10.340]   Is it connected to the dad at all?
[00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:12.860]   - I'm sure it's connected to him also
[00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:13.860]   because he was violent
[00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:16.340]   and it made me feel very scared to be around him.
[00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:20.860]   But I also think it's connected in who he was as a human
[00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:23.300]   is transferred into my DNA.
[00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:25.860]   I think there's a certain amount of,
[00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:30.380]   I mean, to be prejudiced against myself,
[00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:32.540]   I look like a violent person.
[00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:33.820]   If I didn't know me,
[00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:35.500]   I'm just, even the way I'm built,
[00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:36.780]   not even just the working out part,
[00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:38.300]   just the size of my hands
[00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:41.340]   and there's the width of my shoulders.
[00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:44.900]   There's most likely a lot of violence in my history,
[00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:47.220]   in my past, in my ancestry.
[00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:52.220]   And I think we'd minimize that with people.
[00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:54.420]   So much of your behavior,
[00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:55.820]   like when I see my daughter,
[00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:58.300]   I have one daughter that's obsessive
[00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:00.460]   in terms of like, she wants to get really good at things.
[00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:03.220]   Like she'll practice things all day long
[00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:06.780]   and it's 100% my personality.
[00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:09.780]   Like she's me in female form,
[00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:11.580]   but without the anger as much
[00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:13.820]   and without the fear,
[00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:16.500]   like she has a loving household and everything like that.
[00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:21.260]   But she has this intense obsession with doing things
[00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:22.380]   and doing things really well
[00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:23.340]   and getting better.
[00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:24.540]   What's the point we have to tell her,
[00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:26.540]   stop doing hand springs in the house.
[00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:29.180]   Stop, stop, come on, just sit down, have dinner.
[00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:30.180]   Like one more, one more.
[00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:32.460]   Like she's just like, she's psycho.
[00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:39.060]   And I think there's a lot of behavior and personality
[00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:45.700]   and a lot of these things are passed down through genetics.
[00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:47.420]   We don't really know, right?
[00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:51.740]   We don't know how much of who you are genetically
[00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:54.500]   is learned behavior, you know, nature or nurture.
[00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:57.060]   We don't know if it's learned behavior
[00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:58.180]   or whether or not it's something
[00:19:58.180 --> 00:19:59.700]   that's intrinsically a part of you
[00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:01.940]   because of who your parents were.
[00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:06.620]   I think there's certainly some genetic violence in me.
[00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:07.940]   - And then you channeled it.
[00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:08.780]   - Yeah, I channeled it.
[00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:10.460]   - So you figured out is basically your life
[00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:13.260]   is a productive exploration of how to channel that.
[00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:17.180]   - Yes, how to figure out how to get that monkey
[00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:19.860]   to sit down and calm down.
[00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:21.180]   There's another person in there.
[00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:26.180]   Like there's a calm, rational, kind, friendly person
[00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:28.300]   who just wants to laugh and have fun.
[00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:30.580]   And then there's that dude who comes out
[00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:32.620]   when I did "Sober October."
[00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:34.660]   That guy's scary, I don't like that guy.
[00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:37.140]   That guy just wants to get up in the morning and go.
[00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:40.380]   You know, it's like, it's, I mean,
[00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:42.820]   when I was competing, it was necessary,
[00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:44.260]   but it makes me remember.
[00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:48.420]   I didn't really remember what I used to be like until that.
[00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:51.780]   It's like when I'm working out seven hours a day
[00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:53.620]   and just so obsessed.
[00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:55.900]   And all I was thinking about was winning.
[00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:56.900]   That's all I was thinking about.
[00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:59.220]   Like if they were working out five hours a day,
[00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:01.700]   I wanted them to know that I was gonna work out
[00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:04.420]   an extra three hours and I was gonna get up early
[00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:06.660]   and I was gonna text them all, "Hey, pussies,
[00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:08.740]   "I'm up already, take pictures, send selfies."
[00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:09.580]   (Lex laughing)
[00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:11.100]   I was like, "You're gonna die."
[00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:12.940]   Or I kept telling them, "You're all gonna die.
[00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:14.860]   "You try to keep up with me, you're gonna die."
[00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:16.660]   - You weren't fully joking.
[00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:18.060]   - No, I wasn't joking at all.
[00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:18.900]   - That's what was fucked up about it.
[00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:21.500]   - This is the scary thing when I interacted with Goggins
[00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:26.500]   and what I saw in you during that time is like,
[00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:30.780]   this guy, like, this is why I've been avoiding
[00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:31.980]   David Goggins recently.
[00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:33.700]   (Lex laughing)
[00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:35.100]   Is like, 'cause he wants to meet,
[00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:37.020]   he wants to do the talk on this podcast,
[00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:39.740]   but he also wants to run an ultra marathon with me.
[00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:42.180]   And I felt like this is a person,
[00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:44.420]   if I spend any time in this realm,
[00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:46.100]   if I spend any time with the Joe Rogan
[00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:50.900]   of that Sober October, like, I might have to die to get out.
[00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:52.660]   Like, there's this kind of--
[00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:55.560]   - Yeah, there's a competitive aspect that's super unhealthy.
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:57.640]   I mean, you saw the video that we watched earlier today
[00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:59.380]   of Goggins draining his knee.
[00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:01.660]   That would stop me from running ever again
[00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:02.620]   because I would think in my head,
[00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:04.480]   "Okay, I'm gonna ruin my cartilage,
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.260]   "I'm gonna need a knee replacement."
[00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:08.820]   I would start thinking, I would go down that line.
[00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:13.140]   But he is perpetually in this push it mindset.
[00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:16.300]   You know, what he calls the dog in him.
[00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:19.060]   That dog is in him all day long and he feeds that dog.
[00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:22.540]   And that's who he is.
[00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:24.500]   That's one of the reasons why he's so inspirational
[00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:27.700]   and he's fuel for millions and millions of people.
[00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:28.660]   I mean, he really is.
[00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:32.580]   He motivates people in a way that is so powerful,
[00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:35.180]   but it can be very destructive.
[00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:38.140]   I just, I know now,
[00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:39.780]   especially after the Sober October thing,
[00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:41.380]   that that thing's still in me.
[00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:43.100]   You know, I didn't know.
[00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:45.500]   So I really haven't done anything physically competitive.
[00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:48.020]   Except one time I was supposed to fight Wesley Snipes.
[00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:49.340]   It came out then too.
[00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:50.740]   That came out too.
[00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:51.780]   That got creepy too.
[00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:53.820]   But luckily that never happened.
[00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:56.780]   But that was many months of training.
[00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:59.620]   Like training twice a day, every day.
[00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:01.980]   Kickboxing in the morning, Jiu-Jitsu at night.
[00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:04.220]   I was just going and going and going and going.
[00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:07.100]   And I was just thinking just all day long.
[00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:09.700]   But it fucks with all the other aspects of your life.
[00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:10.940]   It fucks with your friendships.
[00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:13.580]   It fucks with my comedy.
[00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:14.860]   It fucks with everything.
[00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:18.460]   Because that mindset is not a mindset of an artist.
[00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:20.300]   It's a mindset of a conqueror.
[00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:21.140]   - The conqueror.
[00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:22.140]   - Yeah. - Destroyer.
[00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:23.260]   That's why it's so interesting
[00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:25.300]   to see Mike Tyson make the switch.
[00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:27.980]   It's clear that like, whatever that is,
[00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:29.660]   however that fight goes, he made a,
[00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:30.900]   there's a switch of a different,
[00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:32.780]   he stepped into a different dimension.
[00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:35.060]   - Roy Jones Jr. is coming on my podcast soon.
[00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:38.060]   And you know, Roy's gonna be on before the fight.
[00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:42.660]   I'm so curious to see how it goes down,
[00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:44.900]   but genuinely concerned.
[00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:46.820]   'Cause Mike Tyson is a heavyweight.
[00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:49.860]   And Roy Jones at his best was 168 pounds.
[00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:50.700]   And that's--
[00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:53.860]   - And I don't know if Roy has that room in his house,
[00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:56.100]   mental house of where Mike Tyson goes.
[00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:57.020]   - I don't know.
[00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:58.420]   I don't know if he has that room.
[00:23:58.420 --> 00:23:59.580]   Mike doesn't have a room.
[00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:01.500]   He's got an empire in there.
[00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:03.020]   He opens up the door. - With tigers.
[00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:04.500]   - He opens up the door.
[00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:06.140]   There's a whole empire in his head.
[00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:08.460]   And he's in that firmly.
[00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:10.140]   You know, when he got out of the weed
[00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:13.740]   and started training again, like you could see it in him.
[00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:18.020]   And by the way, physically, in person, he looks spectacular.
[00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:20.300]   He looks like a fucking Adonis.
[00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:22.060]   I mean, he looks ready to go.
[00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:23.140]   It's crazy.
[00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:24.500]   - Yeah, I watch videos of him.
[00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:25.820]   What about you?
[00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:28.580]   Have you ever considered competing in Jiu-Jitsu?
[00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:30.180]   - No, for that very reason.
[00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:32.140]   I don't want to get obsessed.
[00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:34.060]   That's my number one concern.
[00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:35.820]   I had to quit video games
[00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:37.340]   when we were playing video games at the studio.
[00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:39.700]   I had to quit because I was playing five hours a day,
[00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:40.540]   like out of nowhere.
[00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:41.900]   All of a sudden I was playing five hours a day.
[00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:43.420]   I was coming home late for dinner.
[00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:45.500]   I was ending podcasts early
[00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:47.660]   and jumping on the video games and playing.
[00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:48.980]   I get obsessed with things
[00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:51.660]   and I have to recognize what that is.
[00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:53.540]   And these competitive things,
[00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:55.900]   like competitive, especially like really exciting
[00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:57.580]   competitive things like video games,
[00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:58.980]   they're very dangerous for me.
[00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:02.260]   The ultimate competitive video game is like Jiu-Jitsu.
[00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:05.380]   And if I was young, I most certainly would have done it
[00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:08.260]   if I didn't have like a very clear career path.
[00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:09.620]   It was something that I enjoyed.
[00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:11.300]   My concern would be that I would become
[00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:14.100]   a professional Jiu-Jitsu fighter when I was young.
[00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:17.180]   And then I would not have the energy to do standup
[00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:18.300]   and do all the other things
[00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:20.620]   that I wound up doing as a career.
[00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:25.260]   When I was 21, I quit my job teaching.
[00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:27.260]   I was teaching at Boston University.
[00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:28.980]   I was teaching Taekwondo there.
[00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:33.500]   And I knew, and I also had my own school in Revere.
[00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:35.380]   I knew I couldn't do it right
[00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:38.420]   and also be doing standup comedy.
[00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:40.300]   I knew I couldn't do both of those things.
[00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:41.140]   There was no way.
[00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:44.460]   - You have to be cognizant of that obsessive force
[00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:45.740]   within you to make sure.
[00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:49.300]   - Yes, I'd have to know how to manage my mental illness.
[00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:51.500]   That's a very particular mental illness.
[00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:55.660]   And I think that mental illness, again, my formative years
[00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:59.620]   from 15 till I was 21-ish, 22,
[00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:04.380]   those years were spent constantly obsessed
[00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:05.700]   with martial arts.
[00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:07.060]   That was my whole day.
[00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:09.220]   I mean, I trained almost every day.
[00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:10.660]   The only time I would not train
[00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:14.380]   is if I was either injured or if I was exhausted,
[00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:16.980]   if I needed a day off, but I was obsessed.
[00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:21.420]   And so that part of my personality that I haven't nurtured
[00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:24.100]   is always gonna be there under the surface.
[00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:27.340]   And when it gets reignited by something,
[00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:29.580]   it's a very weird, it's a weird feeling.
[00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:31.780]   And it can get reignited with a video game.
[00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:33.740]   It can get reignited with anything.
[00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:38.220]   That obsessive, whatever it is, that competitive demon.
[00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:39.620]   - Yeah, the way you talk about guitar,
[00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:42.140]   I know you would fall in love with playing guitar,
[00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:44.420]   but I think you're very wise to not touch that thing.
[00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:45.980]   - That's why I won't golf.
[00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:47.060]   I have friends who wanna golf.
[00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:49.700]   I'm like, "Mm-mm, I ain't fucking with that thing."
[00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:51.100]   - So a lot of people ask me,
[00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:55.340]   "What's Joe Rogan's jiu-jitsu game like?"
[00:26:55.500 --> 00:27:00.340]   Like assuming that I somehow spend hours rolling with you
[00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:02.460]   before and after we interact.
[00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:05.660]   I mean, what's a good, you should at some point
[00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:07.260]   show a technique or something, that'd be fun.
[00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:08.580]   - Sure, I mean, I've got--
[00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:09.420]   - What's your game like?
[00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:10.460]   What's your A game?
[00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:15.300]   Oh, I saw you doing, I think, head and arm something online.
[00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:16.740]   - Yeah, I did.
[00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:18.060]   That was, I fucked my neck.
[00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:19.140]   I'm doing head and arm chokes.
[00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:21.260]   I did them so much that I,
[00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:24.700]   because you use your neck so much with head and arm chokes,
[00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:27.340]   I developed a real kink in my neck
[00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:29.700]   and it turned out I had a bulging disc.
[00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:33.100]   - So you do it on that, just one side?
[00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:35.820]   - Well, it was, no, I could do it on the left side,
[00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:38.180]   but I definitely am better on the right side.
[00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:39.380]   The right side was my best side.
[00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:41.260]   - So if you were to compete, let's say,
[00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:42.500]   what's your A game?
[00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:45.060]   Where would you go from standing up,
[00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:46.700]   how would you go to submission?
[00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:47.620]   Would you pull guard?
[00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:49.380]   Would you take down?
[00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:51.660]   How would you pass guard?
[00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:52.940]   - I don't have good takedowns.
[00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:54.260]   I was not a good wrestler.
[00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:57.620]   So I would most likely either pull guard
[00:27:57.620 --> 00:27:59.260]   or I would pull half guard.
[00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:00.100]   - Do you have a good guard?
[00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:00.940]   - Yes.
[00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:02.900]   - Are you comfortable being on your butt and your back?
[00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:04.820]   - Yes, I'm very flexible.
[00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:07.860]   So I have a good, my rubber guard is pretty good.
[00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:10.620]   Yeah, I have good arm bars and good triangles off my back,
[00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:14.020]   but I also have a very good half guard,
[00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:16.100]   but my top game is my best.
[00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:18.500]   I have a very strong top game.
[00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:19.500]   - Do you have a half guard?
[00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:21.980]   Do you have a preference of what kind of guard
[00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:23.460]   and how to pass that guard?
[00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:28.460]   And like, yeah, like, is there a specific game plan?
[00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:29.500]   Like, do you--
[00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:32.780]   - Double under hooks from half guard is the game plan for me.
[00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:34.700]   If I can get double under hooks from half guard,
[00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:36.300]   I could sweep a lot of people.
[00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:37.980]   - Under hooks of what?
[00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:38.820]   Sorry, the arms or the legs?
[00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:41.020]   - So half guard, lock down, right?
[00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:44.180]   Half guard, go into lock down, double under hooks.
[00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:45.020]   - Got it.
[00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:46.700]   - Clinch to the body, suck the body and tight.
[00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:47.540]   - Just pressure.
[00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:48.820]   - And yeah, massive pressure.
[00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:51.660]   And then inch my way into a position,
[00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:52.740]   we call the dog fight,
[00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:54.340]   and inch my way into a position
[00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:56.700]   where I could get the person on their back.
[00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:58.500]   - Yeah, that's what, 'cause you did show me,
[00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:00.900]   I still disagree with you about the tie thing.
[00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:01.740]   - The tie?
[00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:02.580]   - That you can choke somebody with the tie.
[00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:03.420]   - Oh, tie as well.
[00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:05.180]   - So wrong, so wrong.
[00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:06.460]   - Well, it's not wrong with you.
[00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:08.300]   With you, it's wrong 'cause you--
[00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:09.460]   - No, I think there's a system.
[00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:11.900]   I have this thing with Don and her,
[00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:12.980]   we're gonna figure it out.
[00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:13.820]   Okay, but--
[00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:16.060]   - You just have a little Velcro in the back.
[00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:17.660]   - No, but see, you're just not the--
[00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:18.500]   - You're cheating.
[00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:19.980]   - You're not, yeah, exactly, that's cheating.
[00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:21.660]   (Lex laughing)
[00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:24.260]   Yeah, you did, I did feel when you showed me,
[00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:25.980]   I think you showed me the rubber guard,
[00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:27.060]   'cause it's still a guard.
[00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:28.300]   That's a little bit foreign to me.
[00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:30.960]   I just felt that you can immediately feel,
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:32.100]   not with the rubber guard,
[00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:34.620]   but the way you move your body is,
[00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:37.900]   you're like a Shanji type of guy
[00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:40.580]   who knows how to control another human being.
[00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:43.380]   So like, some people are a little bit more,
[00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:44.980]   I would say, agile and technical,
[00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:47.220]   like playful and kind of--
[00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:48.060]   - Loose.
[00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:51.780]   - Loose, and they work on transition, transition, transition.
[00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:52.940]   You're a control guy.
[00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:54.700]   Like, you know how to control position
[00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:56.240]   and advance position.
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:57.340]   Don and her is the same way.
[00:29:57.340 --> 00:29:58.500]   He's all about control.
[00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:00.420]   - My game is smush.
[00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:02.300]   That's my game, smush you.
[00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:03.220]   Grab ahold of you.
[00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:04.980]   Once I have you, why would I let you go?
[00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:06.900]   That's my thought, is like, why would I let you go?
[00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:09.740]   I just wanna incrementally move to a better position
[00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:11.340]   until I can strangle you.
[00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:14.380]   But I'm much more into strangling people
[00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:15.420]   than anything else.
[00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:17.420]   - Yeah, which is a great MMA--
[00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:18.260]   - Yeah.
[00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:20.620]   - Approach for jiu-jitsu.
[00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:24.380]   - Well, too many people don't tap when you get their arms.
[00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:26.460]   And I'm not opposed to arm bars.
[00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:29.660]   I love arm bars, but everybody goes to sleep.
[00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:30.780]   - Yep.
[00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:33.180]   And quit from pressure too.
[00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:35.580]   I mean, quit mentally.
[00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:36.420]   There's nothing like that.
[00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:37.620]   - You can't breathe.
[00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:40.180]   If you got a guy who's like a really good top game guy
[00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:42.900]   and he mounts you, and I'm a big fan of mounting
[00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:45.840]   with my legs crossed, like a guard,
[00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:50.840]   like a top guard, and so I can squeeze with both legs,
[00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:54.980]   smush, and I'm just looking for people to make mistakes
[00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:57.820]   and slowly, incrementally bettering my position
[00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:00.140]   until I can get something locked up.
[00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:01.340]   I love jiu-jitsu though, man.
[00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:02.820]   I just wish it didn't injure you.
[00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:03.660]   - Yeah.
[00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:06.540]   - Jiu-jitsu is like, if your joints were more durable,
[00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:08.740]   they could figure out a way to make joints more durable.
[00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:10.660]   God, I could do jiu-jitsu forever.
[00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:12.340]   - Yeah. - So much fun.
[00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:14.900]   - I actually, I talked to this roboticist,
[00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:17.880]   Russ Tedrick, he builds, he's one of the world-class people
[00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:19.280]   that builds humanoid robots.
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:20.720]   You were interested in Boston Dynamics.
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:21.920]   - Yeah. - He's one of the key people
[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:23.440]   in that kind of robotics.
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:25.560]   So I asked him the stupidest question of like,
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:30.140]   how far are we from having a robot be a UFC champion?
[00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:31.520]   (Lex laughing)
[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:34.200]   And yeah, it's actually a really, really tough problem.
[00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:39.200]   It's the same thing that makes somebody like Daniel Comey
[00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:41.160]   on the wrestling side special,
[00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:42.600]   'cause you have to understand the movement
[00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:45.960]   of the human body in ways that's so difficult to teach.
[00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:49.000]   It's so subtle, the timing, the pressure points,
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.720]   the leverage, all those kinds of things.
[00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:52.920]   That's just for the clinch situation.
[00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:56.680]   And then the movement for the striking is very difficult.
[00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:58.880]   As long as you're not allowed as a robot
[00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:03.600]   to use your natural abilities of having a lot more power.
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:06.520]   - Right, a lot more power and more durable.
[00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:08.000]   - Right. - The human body,
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.240]   especially meniscus, you see the heel hook game,
[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:15.280]   everybody's involved in leg locks and heel hooks.
[00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:18.200]   All those guys wind up with torched knees.
[00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:19.560]   Everyone's got torched knees.
[00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:21.440]   Everyone's knees are torn apart.
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:23.640]   And you don't grow new meniscus.
[00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:26.920]   That's like one of those joints where, man, when it goes,
[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:31.760]   and those guys are 28 years old, have blown out knees.
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:33.040]   - Let me ask the ridiculous question.
[00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:34.680]   What do you think, we're talking about cops,
[00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:36.880]   so what do you think is the best martial arts
[00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:38.320]   for self-defense?
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:39.560]   - For sure, jujitsu.
[00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:41.080]   Yeah, for sure. - Wrestling?
[00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:43.760]   - I think grappling, I should say.
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:46.200]   Judo as well, especially in a cold climate,
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:48.760]   if you get someone who's got a heavy winter jacket on,
[00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:50.680]   my God, judo's an incredible martial art.
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:51.640]   - Plus concrete.
[00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:54.640]   - That's the worst place to be,
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:57.520]   with a heavy winter jacket with a judo specialist,
[00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:00.360]   and you're standing up with them, oh my God.
[00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:01.920]   But I think grappling,
[00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:03.840]   because in most self-defense situations,
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:05.800]   it usually winds up with grappling.
[00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:07.320]   You're definitely better off, though,
[00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:08.760]   knowing some striking,
[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:10.240]   'cause there's nothing more terrifying
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:11.600]   than when you go to take someone down,
[00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:14.480]   they actually have takedown skills, but they can fight.
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:16.320]   And so they have takedown defense,
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:17.360]   and they know how to fight,
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:19.560]   and then you don't know how to stand up.
[00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:20.400]   The worst thing in the world
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:21.680]   is seeing someone reaching,
[00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:23.800]   who doesn't know how to do striking,
[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:25.320]   and someone cracks you.
[00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:27.240]   - What about all that Krav Maga talk,
[00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:30.080]   which is the whole line of argument
[00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:31.760]   that says that jujitsu and wrestling,
[00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:33.240]   and all of these sports,
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:35.040]   they fundamentally take you away
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:36.320]   from the nature of violence.
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:38.500]   So they're just teaching you how to play,
[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:44.160]   versus the reality of violence
[00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:47.820]   that is involved in a self-defense situation,
[00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:52.040]   that a totally different set of skills would be needed.
[00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:54.160]   - In general, the people that say
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:56.900]   that jujitsu or other martial arts,
[00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:59.720]   it's more of a sport,
[00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:03.880]   and they don't really understand violence,
[00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:06.160]   in general, the people that say that suck.
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:08.160]   - Yeah.
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:09.880]   - Anybody who thinks,
[00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:12.000]   someone's like, "Hey man, I'll just bite you."
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.640]   I'm like, "Are you gonna bite me?
[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:15.880]   "Okay, do you think I'm gonna bite you too?
[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:16.760]   "What do you think of that?
[00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:18.440]   "What if I punch you in your fucking face?
[00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:19.800]   "You think you're still gonna bite me
[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:21.440]   "when you can't even see?
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:23.920]   "When you barely even know you're alive,
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:25.560]   "and I choke you unconscious?"
[00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:27.440]   If someone's really good at jujitsu,
[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:29.880]   good luck stabbing them with your keys.
[00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:31.400]   You don't have a chance.
[00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:32.240]   You don't have a chance.
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:33.060]   If someone's much better at you,
[00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:35.440]   and they trip you, and get you on your back,
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:37.680]   and then they fucking elbow you in your face,
[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:39.480]   and then get a head and arm choke on you,
[00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:41.840]   all that Krav Maga shit's out the window, son.
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:46.840]   You're way better off learning what works on trained killers.
[00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:48.920]   Like this whole idea that you're gonna poke someone
[00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:50.800]   in the eye, and then you're gonna kick them in the nuts.
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:53.280]   Like you're going through these drills,
[00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:55.560]   that yeah, it's good to know what to do
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:57.800]   if you run into someone who doesn't know how to fight.
[00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:00.200]   It's way better to know what to do
[00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:02.240]   to someone who knows how to fight.
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:03.800]   That's the best thing.
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:07.320]   Learn how to fight against people who know how to fight.
[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:09.920]   Like all that practice self-defense,
[00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:11.680]   and they're gonna come at you with a knife,
[00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:13.240]   you're gonna grab the wrist and do that.
[00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:16.800]   Like it's good to know self-defense,
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:20.440]   but it's much more important to understand martial arts
[00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:22.080]   comprehensively.
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:24.360]   When you understand martial arts comprehensively,
[00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:25.720]   like there's no Krav,
[00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:27.400]   I shouldn't say there's no Krav Maga guys,
[00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:32.000]   but it would be shocking if a Krav Maga guy,
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.520]   and a mixed martial arts guy had a fight,
[00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:36.960]   and the mixed martial arts guy was a trained killer
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:39.360]   all around, didn't fuck that guy up.
[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:41.920]   That's what I would expect would happen.
[00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:44.640]   I would not think that some guy
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:48.040]   who has a little bit of this and a little bit of that,
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:49.920]   and prepares for the streets,
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:53.280]   is gonna be able to handle a person who trains with killers
[00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:56.280]   on a day-to-day basis, who rolls with jiu-jitsu black belts,
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:58.200]   who trains with Muay Thai champions.
[00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:01.800]   The best martial arts are the martial arts
[00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:03.760]   that work on martial artists,
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:06.360]   not the martial arts that work on untrained people.
[00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:09.360]   - What about, we're in Texas now, what about guns?
[00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:10.720]   - Well, that's the best martial art.
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:14.920]   - No, but would you, in this crazy time,
[00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:17.000]   should people carry guns?
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.160]   - It's not a bad idea to have a gun,
[00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:22.200]   because if you need a gun, you have a gun.
[00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:24.000]   And if you don't need a gun,
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.640]   if you're a person with self-control,
[00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:26.800]   you're not gonna use it.
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:28.440]   You're not gonna just randomly use it,
[00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:30.440]   but you have something to protect you.
[00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:32.240]   This is the whole idea of the Second Amendment.
[00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:33.280]   The whole idea of the Second Amendment
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:34.900]   gets distorted by mass shootings,
[00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:37.160]   or by terrible people who murder people
[00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:38.040]   and do terrible things.
[00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:40.880]   But all those things are real,
[00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:45.880]   but they don't take away from the fundamental efficacy
[00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:49.160]   of having a firearm and defending your family,
[00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:50.720]   or defending your life.
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:53.160]   And there are real live situations
[00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:55.480]   where people have had firearms,
[00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:58.120]   and it's protected them, or their loved ones,
[00:36:58.120 --> 00:37:00.160]   or they've stopped shooters.
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:01.600]   There's many of these stories,
[00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:02.800]   but people don't like those stories,
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:06.740]   because then it tends to lead to this gun culture argument,
[00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:08.500]   this pro-gun culture argument
[00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:11.180]   that people find very uncomfortable.
[00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:12.980]   Human beings are messy,
[00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:15.260]   and we're messy in so many different ways.
[00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:19.020]   We're messy emotionally, we're messy physically,
[00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:22.100]   but we're also messy in what's good or bad.
[00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:23.740]   We want things to be binary.
[00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:27.260]   We want things to be right or wrong, one or zero.
[00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:28.540]   And they're not.
[00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:31.260]   But there is crime in the world,
[00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:32.700]   and there is violence in the world,
[00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:35.040]   and you're better off knowing how to fight,
[00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:37.760]   and you're better off knowing how to defend yourself,
[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:39.580]   and you're better off having a gun.
[00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:41.880]   - And I generally think that guns,
[00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:44.500]   I do like the idea that guns,
[00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:46.500]   Second Amendment helps protect the First Amendment.
[00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:50.220]   There's a kind of sense that puts me at ease
[00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:53.500]   knowing that so many people in this country have guns,
[00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:55.500]   that, I mean, Alex Jones,
[00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:58.380]   I just listened to one episode of "Info Wars"
[00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:00.020]   for the first time.
[00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:03.620]   Boy, he reminds me like when I drank some tequila,
[00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:06.500]   I felt like I'm going to some dark places today.
[00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:08.580]   That's how I feel like listening to him.
[00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:12.260]   But he talks about like that it's,
[00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:14.600]   he worries about martial law.
[00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:16.460]   So basically government overreach
[00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:18.760]   by which happened throughout history.
[00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:21.700]   Like there's something to worry about there,
[00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:23.820]   but it puts me at ease knowing
[00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:26.700]   that so much of the population has guns
[00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:29.180]   that people, government would think twice
[00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:32.300]   before instituting martial law in cities.
[00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:34.140]   But I actually was asking,
[00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:36.320]   almost like on the individual level,
[00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:40.500]   I maybe shouldn't say this, but I don't yet own a gun.
[00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:44.260]   And I felt that if I carry a gun,
[00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:46.260]   statistically, just for me as a human,
[00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:49.940]   knowing my psychology, I feel like I'm more likely to die.
[00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:53.700]   Like I feel like I would put myself in situations
[00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:54.520]   that I shouldn't.
[00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:57.660]   Like the way I will see the world will change.
[00:38:57.660 --> 00:39:01.260]   Because my natural feeling is like when somebody,
[00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:04.260]   when I was in Philly and I knew late at night,
[00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:08.440]   if West Philly, when some guy looks at you,
[00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:09.960]   you can immediately calculate
[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:12.580]   that this is a dangerous human being.
[00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:14.660]   It starts with a monkey look at first,
[00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:17.220]   like I'm a bigger monkey than you.
[00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:19.280]   And that's where I found like, for example,
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:21.700]   I'll do the beta thing of just looking down and turning away
[00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:25.140]   and just getting out of trouble, like very politely.
[00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:28.100]   And basically that kind of approach,
[00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:31.300]   because if you have, in terms of getting out
[00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:32.820]   of serious violent situations,
[00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:35.580]   like serious something where you could die,
[00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:39.500]   versus if I had a gun, I feel like I would want to be,
[00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:43.080]   that would be that cowboy monkey thing
[00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:45.640]   where I would want to put myself in situations
[00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:48.780]   where I'm a little bit of a savior, even of myself,
[00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:53.180]   and almost create danger, which can no longer,
[00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:57.100]   like the escalation of which I can no longer control.
[00:39:57.100 --> 00:39:59.140]   - Well, you're talking about taking a gun somewhere
[00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:00.660]   versus having a gun in your home.
[00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:02.180]   - Yes, yes, I mean carry on me.
[00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:04.460]   - That's a different situation and much harder
[00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:07.860]   to get a warrant or a license for that.
[00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:10.380]   Control, concealed carry licenses,
[00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:12.300]   especially in Massachusetts, they don't come easy.
[00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:14.060]   - Well, Massachusetts, yeah, that's a whole nother thing.
[00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:14.900]   - Yeah.
[00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:16.400]   - You're saying gun in the home.
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:18.540]   - Yeah, gun in the home, having a gun,
[00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:19.940]   knowing how to use a gun.
[00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:21.080]   Like I know how to use a gun.
[00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:25.260]   I've trained many hours learning how to shoot a gun
[00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:27.300]   at tactical places.
[00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:31.400]   There's a bunch of videos of me doing it on Instagram.
[00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:34.580]   I practice and I think it's good to understand
[00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:36.180]   to how to be accurate.
[00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:38.900]   - So I've been a fan of your podcast for a long time.
[00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:40.820]   You don't often talk about it
[00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:42.300]   'cause you're always kind of looking forward,
[00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:45.760]   but if you look at the old studio that you just left,
[00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:49.020]   is there some epic memories that stand out to you
[00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:53.840]   that you almost look back, I can't believe this happened?
[00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:57.040]   - Oh yeah, almost too many of them to count.
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:58.400]   - Is there something that pops into mind now?
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:01.340]   - All of them, Elon Musk blowing that flamethrower
[00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:02.960]   in the middle of the hallway.
[00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:04.320]   I've got a video of that.
[00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:05.440]   Have you seen the video of it?
[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:07.000]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think you posted it on Instagram.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:08.120]   - I think I did too.
[00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:09.800]   Yeah, he's a madman.
[00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:11.600]   Having Bernie Sanders in there,
[00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:16.180]   just all the fun fight companions we did
[00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:18.800]   and all the crazy podcasts with Joey Diaz
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:21.280]   and Duncan Trussell and there was so many,
[00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:22.680]   there were so many moments.
[00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:27.760]   Podcasts, this is a weird art form
[00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:30.960]   and it almost seems like, sounds silly,
[00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:32.820]   but it almost seems like something that chose me
[00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:34.520]   rather than I chose it.
[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:36.960]   I think of that all the time in some strange way.
[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:40.440]   It's like I'm showing up as like an antenna
[00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:43.280]   and I just plug in and twist on
[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:46.840]   and then I take in the thing and I put it together
[00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:49.880]   and I'm like a passenger of this weird ride.
[00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:51.680]   - Yeah, you've talked about this before.
[00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:55.800]   I really like this idea of that human beings
[00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:57.880]   are just carriers of these ideas.
[00:41:57.880 --> 00:41:59.960]   Ideas are the ones who are breeding.
[00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:02.980]   So in a sense, the idea found you as a useful brain
[00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:06.400]   to use to spread itself through the podcasting medium.
[00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:12.720]   'Cause when I think about your podcast,
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:13.880]   I think about Joey Diaz.
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:16.240]   I think about all those comedians you've had.
[00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:18.640]   I mean, I think you've had Joey on,
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:22.840]   I mean, maybe close to 50 times, 60, some crazy number.
[00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:27.840]   Is there, I mean, he is over the top offensive,
[00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:30.680]   just that's who he is to the core.
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:35.680]   Is there some sense where you wondered
[00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:41.640]   like whether it's right to have the Spotify episode
[00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:44.880]   number one with Duncan Dressel for five hours?
[00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:45.920]   - No.
[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:47.240]   I wanted to do it that way.
[00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:51.000]   That's why we wore NASA suits and we got high as fuck.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.240]   It's like, that's the whole idea behind it.
[00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:54.880]   - I mean, can you introspect that a little bit?
[00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:56.200]   Like, can you think, like, what is that?
[00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:57.320]   'Cause that's rare.
[00:42:57.320 --> 00:43:02.320]   It's such a rare thing to do because you're not supposed
[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:06.760]   to talk to Duncan Dressel with a huge platform
[00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:08.360]   that you have five hours.
[00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:09.480]   - Why not?
[00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:12.720]   - Because Donald Trump apparently watches your podcast.
[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:14.800]   (laughing)
[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:16.640]   - So just the idea that there's these,
[00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:19.600]   I mean, that's what I think about these CEOs, right,
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:23.280]   to me, that they listen to the podcast that I do.
[00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:26.400]   And I have somebody like a David Fravor,
[00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:27.840]   and I was nervous about it.
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:29.400]   I was nervous to have a conversation.
[00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:33.160]   For me, David Fravor is a Duncan Dressel, which is like--
[00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:36.400]   - Just because of his experiences with UFOs.
[00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:39.080]   - Yeah, even just the way he sees the world
[00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:41.400]   because he is open, I don't know if he's always like this,
[00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:43.640]   but he opened himself to the possibility
[00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:45.840]   of unconventional ideas.
[00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:48.720]   Most people in the scientific community kinda say,
[00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:50.400]   well, I don't really wanna believe anything
[00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:52.960]   that doesn't have a lot of hard evidence.
[00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:55.000]   And so that was to me like a step.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.400]   And as the thing somehow becomes more popular,
[00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:01.040]   there becomes this fear of like,
[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:04.200]   well, should I talk to this person or not?
[00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:06.960]   And I mean, you're an inspiration in saying like,
[00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:08.200]   do whatever the hell you want.
[00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:09.720]   - You have to.
[00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:14.120]   - First of all, I have what you call fuck you money.
[00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:16.240]   And if you have fuck you money, you don't say fuck you.
[00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:18.240]   What's the point of having the fuck you money?
[00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:19.640]   You're wasting it.
[00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:21.120]   Like you're wasting the position.
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:22.840]   Like someone said to me like,
[00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:24.640]   why do you like sports cars so much?
[00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:25.720]   Like how many cars do you have?
[00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:26.560]   A bunch of cars.
[00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:28.760]   'Cause if I was a kid and I said,
[00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:31.400]   hey, if I was that crazy, rich, famous guy,
[00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:34.000]   like I don't wanna have a bunch of cool fucking cars.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.240]   Like, so I would do that.
[00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:39.080]   Like, 'cause not everybody gets to do that.
[00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:40.960]   Like if you're the person that gets to do that,
[00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:42.640]   you're kind of supposed to do it.
[00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:44.720]   Like that's, if you want to,
[00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:46.320]   if that really does speak to you.
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:49.520]   And, you know, I've talked to you about this before,
[00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:53.480]   muscle cars, specifically ones from the 1960s
[00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:56.680]   and the early '70s, they speak to me in some weird way, man.
[00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:57.920]   I could just stare at them.
[00:44:57.920 --> 00:44:59.560]   Like I have a '65 Corvette.
[00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:02.520]   I walk around it sometimes at night when no one's around.
[00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:03.360]   I just stare at it.
[00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:05.600]   - What's your favorite muscle car?
[00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:09.840]   Like what's your most badass late '60s, the perfect car?
[00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:10.680]   - Probably that car.
[00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:12.600]   Probably that '65 Corvette. - '65 Corvette.
[00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:15.400]   - Yeah, I walk around it when no one's around.
[00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:17.040]   - I think I'm drawing the '69 Corvette.
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:19.640]   Is there a particular year that just--
[00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:22.240]   - '65 is a generation two.
[00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:24.080]   '69 is generation three.
[00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:26.880]   '69 is like the, it's even more curvy.
[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:29.580]   They're both awesome, just awesome in different ways.
[00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:33.280]   But I just love muscle cars for whatever reason.
[00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:36.200]   But the point is, I like what I like,
[00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:38.200]   and if I can do what I wanna do,
[00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:39.400]   I should do what I wanna do.
[00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:41.000]   And it's not hurting anybody.
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.920]   And the thing is, I would do the Duncan podcast
[00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:45.840]   if no one was listening, right?
[00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:48.300]   If we were just starting to do a podcast together
[00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:50.840]   and no one cared and it got like 2,000 views,
[00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:53.360]   which we did for years. - Yeah, for a long time.
[00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:54.920]   - I would do it with Duncan and we would get high
[00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:57.640]   and we'd talk crazy shit about aliens and spaceships
[00:45:57.640 --> 00:46:01.000]   and maybe, dude, maybe ideas are living life forms
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   and they're inside your head
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.680]   and that's how things get made. - Man.
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:04.520]   - Yeah, man.
[00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:06.000]   (laughing)
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.040]   It just kind of morphed me and him together in that
[00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:11.600]   because the life form idea, life form idea is mine
[00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:14.080]   that I really think about a lot.
[00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:17.040]   - I think about it on a technical side, by the way.
[00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:18.920]   When I heard you say that, 'cause I've been thinking,
[00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:21.320]   I was like, whoa, that's interesting.
[00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:24.480]   - They might be alive because they,
[00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:25.720]   I don't know what the fuck they are,
[00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:29.040]   but when someone has an idea for whatever,
[00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:30.560]   an invention, a toaster,
[00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:32.400]   and then they think about this,
[00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:35.440]   all it'd need is like these heating elements and a spring
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:37.840]   and then it pops when it's done, so I have a timer,
[00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:39.280]   and then they build this thing.
[00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:40.760]   Now all of a sudden it's alive.
[00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:43.440]   It's like you manifested it in a physical form.
[00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:47.400]   Toaster's not the best example, but a car, an airplane,
[00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:49.080]   you're thinking about a thing,
[00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:51.480]   like an idea comes into your head
[00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:53.400]   and you can say, oh, well, it's just creativity,
[00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:54.400]   it's a part of being a person,
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:56.120]   it's how we invented tools
[00:46:56.120 --> 00:46:58.640]   and how we became better hunters.
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:00.400]   All those things are true.
[00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:04.400]   I'm not saying that there's some magic to what I'm saying,
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:07.080]   but there's also a possibility
[00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:09.640]   that we're simplifying something
[00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:11.640]   by saying that it's just creativity,
[00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:15.120]   that it's just a natural human inclination to invent things.
[00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:17.040]   But why?
[00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:20.640]   Is it possible that ideas, like creativity,
[00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:22.640]   like we are the only animal,
[00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:25.720]   other than there's a few species that create things
[00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:27.880]   like bees make beehives,
[00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:29.600]   but they're very uniform.
[00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:32.200]   Some animals use tools,
[00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:35.720]   like chimps will use sticks to get termites
[00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:36.560]   and things like that.
[00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:39.520]   But there's something about what we do
[00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:41.840]   that it makes you wonder,
[00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:42.920]   'cause we look at the,
[00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:44.640]   just look at this room that we're in,
[00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:46.400]   look at all these electronics,
[00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:50.320]   look at all this crazy shit that human beings have invented
[00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:52.400]   and then built upon others' inventions
[00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:54.080]   and improved and innovated.
[00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:56.720]   These all came out of ideas.
[00:47:57.320 --> 00:48:02.160]   The idea, it germinates in someone's head,
[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:04.080]   it bounces around, they write it down,
[00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:05.480]   they share it with others,
[00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:07.360]   the other people who have similar ideas
[00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:08.840]   or ideas that are complementary,
[00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:12.440]   they work together and they change the world.
[00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:15.040]   - And the new thing in that is the ideas, not the people.
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:16.960]   It's like, we think we found the ideas,
[00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:19.520]   but it's more like the ideas found us.
[00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:20.440]   - Find you, yeah.
[00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:22.680]   They're literally in the air.
[00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:24.440]   They come to you.
[00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:26.160]   I always felt like that with bits.
[00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:27.920]   When I come up with a bit,
[00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:29.760]   that's why I'm always telling people
[00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:32.640]   about the Steven Pressfield book, "The War of Art,"
[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:35.400]   because he talks about respecting the muse
[00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:40.040]   and the idea that your ideas come when you sit down
[00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:40.920]   and you do the work,
[00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:42.360]   or you sit down like a professional
[00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:45.720]   and you talk to the muse, like, "Tell me what to do."
[00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:47.680]   Like if the muse was a real thing,
[00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:50.880]   as if a muse is like some mystical creature
[00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:53.560]   that comes and delivers you ideas,
[00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:56.720]   even if that's not real, that's how it works.
[00:48:56.720 --> 00:48:57.840]   It does work like that.
[00:48:57.840 --> 00:49:00.080]   If you do treat it like it's a muse
[00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:01.560]   and you treat it with the respect
[00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:03.680]   and you treat it like a professional,
[00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:05.040]   the ideas do come to you.
[00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:06.320]   - I never thought about what he's doing.
[00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:08.800]   He's just sitting there waiting for the idea
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:10.920]   that's trying to breed to find him.
[00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:11.760]   - Yeah.
[00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:13.240]   - That's a trippy thing.
[00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:14.760]   - If you show up. - It's trippy.
[00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:16.560]   - If you show up and put in the time
[00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:19.040]   and focus your energy on that,
[00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:22.480]   the ideas, they will arrive.
[00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:23.400]   They will arrive.
[00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:25.440]   And that's the same with writing comedy.
[00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:26.840]   Like this has been many, many times
[00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:28.600]   where I'll come home from the comedy store
[00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:30.400]   and I just sit down and I start writing
[00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:32.080]   and I just, I got nothing.
[00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:32.920]   There's nothing there.
[00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:35.160]   I'm just writing a small bullshit.
[00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:36.120]   Nothing's good.
[00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:37.440]   It's just like, hmm, hmm.
[00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:40.600]   And then all of a sudden, bam, there's the idea.
[00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:43.480]   And then all of a sudden I can't stop.
[00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:45.160]   And then, you know, a couple hours later,
[00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:46.240]   and I'm like, "Whoa."
[00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:47.680]   And then the next night I'm on stage
[00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:49.560]   and I'm like, "How about that?"
[00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:51.240]   Boom, it gets this big laugh.
[00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:52.720]   I'm like, "Holy shit."
[00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:55.400]   And I know that came out of the discipline
[00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:57.560]   to sit down and call the muse.
[00:49:57.560 --> 00:49:59.520]   - I mean, the cool thing is the ideas
[00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:03.680]   have found you to like, "Oh, I'm gonna use this dude.
[00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:06.400]   "Like he seems to have a podcast that's popular.
[00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:08.960]   "I'm gonna breed inside his brain
[00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:10.160]   "and spread it to others."
[00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:11.880]   It's the same as--
[00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:12.800]   - Or an inventor.
[00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:13.960]   You know, I'm gonna use this guy
[00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:16.840]   who's like desperately seeking some sort of a product
[00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:17.680]   to bring to market.
[00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:19.120]   Some guy who wants to invent things.
[00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:21.160]   He's thinking about inventing things all the time.
[00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:24.160]   Like these ideas, they weasel their way into your head.
[00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:28.960]   And it seems to me also that the frequency
[00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:32.900]   that your mind operates under has to be correct.
[00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:34.960]   Because one of the things about creativity seems to be
[00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:36.920]   if you think about yourself a lot,
[00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:40.160]   if you're really into yourself or your image
[00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:45.160]   or you're selfish, those ideas, they don't find you.
[00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:46.400]   - Yeah, it's funny.
[00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:49.280]   It stifles the creative, yeah, yeah.
[00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:51.640]   It stifles the opportunity that the idea has
[00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:52.480]   for defining it.
[00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:55.000]   - Yes, which is one of the reasons why joke thieves,
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.560]   people that steal jokes, are terrible writers.
[00:50:57.560 --> 00:50:58.840]   There's never like really good writers
[00:50:58.840 --> 00:51:00.400]   who are also joke thieves.
[00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:03.920]   It's just joke thieves and then, you know,
[00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:05.920]   when they have to write on their own, if they get exposed,
[00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:08.080]   they become terrible comedians.
[00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:11.200]   They're a shadow of what they were
[00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:13.000]   when they were stealing other people's ideas.
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:16.360]   Because the thing that would make you steal a person's idea
[00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:17.920]   is that ego part.
[00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:20.360]   The wanting to claim it for yourself,
[00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:23.080]   the wanting to be the man or the woman.
[00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:24.800]   You know, I wanna be the person who gets out there
[00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:27.440]   and says it and everybody's gonna love me for it.
[00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:30.820]   Like, you can't think like that and be creative.
[00:51:30.820 --> 00:51:34.960]   It requires a humility and it requires a detachment
[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:36.800]   from self in order to create.
[00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:39.360]   Like, when I'm writing, I'm blank.
[00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:40.760]   I'm like, I'm just staring.
[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:44.240]   I'm like, I'm just, the part of my mind that's active
[00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:45.920]   is not like me.
[00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:49.200]   It's like this weird core function part
[00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:53.720]   where I'm not aware of my personality.
[00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:56.080]   I'm not aware of anything.
[00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:58.160]   I'm just trying to put it together
[00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:00.280]   in a way that I know works.
[00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:01.720]   - Yeah, just being there, being present.
[00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:03.000]   That's the Crestfield is just,
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:04.920]   I'm a big believer, just sitting there.
[00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:06.920]   Even staring at a blank page.
[00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:08.160]   - You have to. - Putting in the time.
[00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:10.160]   - Yeah, and sometimes it's not that way.
[00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:11.440]   Sometimes it's an inspiration.
[00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:13.480]   Like, sometimes I'll be sitting there at dinner
[00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:15.320]   and I'll be like, I got an idea.
[00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:16.960]   I know my wife's really cool about that.
[00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:18.000]   I'm like, I have an idea.
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.680]   And I have to just run out of the room real quick
[00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:23.640]   and I write it down on my phone and then I can come back.
[00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:25.840]   Because those are like little gifts
[00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:28.400]   that you get sometimes from the universe out of nowhere.
[00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:31.520]   And some people rely only on those gifts.
[00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:33.120]   You know, and I've talked to comics about it.
[00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:34.800]   They're like, oh, I come up with my best ideas
[00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:35.640]   when I don't write.
[00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:37.480]   I'm like, no, I do too.
[00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:39.160]   I come up with great ideas when I don't write,
[00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:40.520]   but I also write.
[00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:41.880]   Like, you can do both of those things.
[00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:43.480]   They're not mutually exclusive.
[00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:46.880]   - You mentioned fuck you money.
[00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:49.320]   I feel like I have fuck you money now.
[00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:51.040]   A year ago I was at zero.
[00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:54.040]   I have fuck you money now because probably my standard is,
[00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:56.960]   I don't need much in this world.
[00:52:56.960 --> 00:53:00.160]   But because also, probably because of you,
[00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:04.600]   but it's 300 to 400,000 people listen to every episode I do.
[00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:05.480]   - That's a lot.
[00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:07.000]   - And that is weird.
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.320]   - That's a successful television show on cable.
[00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:10.320]   - Yeah, it's crazy.
[00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:11.160]   - It's all you.
[00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:12.480]   - Yeah, it's hilarious.
[00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:13.320]   - That's amazing.
[00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:17.400]   But at this point, that also resulted in a few money
[00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:22.120]   in a sense that I don't need anything else in this world.
[00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:25.840]   But so by way of asking, I've looked up,
[00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:28.560]   you've inspired me for a long time.
[00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:29.800]   Do you have advice?
[00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:33.680]   You've done this on the podcast side of life.
[00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:36.080]   Do you have advice for somebody like,
[00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:40.480]   for me and somebody like me going on this journey?
[00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:43.360]   Eric Weinstein is going on this journey.
[00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:47.520]   Is there advice, both small and big,
[00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:49.280]   that you have for somebody like me?
[00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:53.480]   - The advice is to keep doing what feels right to you
[00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:55.040]   and do what you're doing.
[00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:56.960]   Obviously, it's resonating with people
[00:53:56.960 --> 00:53:58.520]   if you're getting that big of an audience.
[00:53:58.520 --> 00:53:59.760]   And I've listened to your podcast.
[00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:00.840]   You're very good at it.
[00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:04.240]   So just keep doing it the way you're doing it.
[00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:06.760]   Don't let anybody else get involved.
[00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:09.000]   - What about, you've connected,
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:11.120]   I think you met Jamie at the Comedy Store.
[00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:12.560]   - I met him at the Ice House.
[00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:13.400]   - At the Ice House?
[00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:14.240]   - Ice House.
[00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:15.080]   Well, I think I met him at the Comedy Store,
[00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:17.080]   but then we talked at the Ice House.
[00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:17.920]   - I mean, what--
[00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:18.760]   - You'd have to ask him.
[00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:20.600]   - Did you think deeply about,
[00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:25.280]   'cause you basically have nobody on your team.
[00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:27.760]   And so it almost feels like a marriage.
[00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:32.240]   Were you selective about somebody
[00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:34.280]   to bring into your little circle?
[00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:35.960]   - Well, Jamie's exceptional.
[00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:38.200]   - He is, he's a special.
[00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:39.040]   I mean, he might've grown,
[00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:40.680]   I don't remember how he was in the early days,
[00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:41.520]   maybe you could say, but he's grown--
[00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:43.360]   - He's definitely better at it,
[00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:45.400]   but right away, he's exceptional.
[00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:47.960]   He's got very little ego.
[00:54:47.960 --> 00:54:48.800]   - Yes.
[00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:51.000]   - He's not a guy who needs a lot of attention.
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:56.000]   He's not a guy who overestimates anything,
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:00.600]   like in terms of negative or positive,
[00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:05.600]   like his interpretation of whether it's good things
[00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:07.160]   that happened to the show
[00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:08.400]   or bad things that happened to the show,
[00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:10.880]   he just takes it all flat.
[00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:13.440]   He's chill, he's just cool as fuck,
[00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:17.200]   and he's so smart, and he's so good as an audio engineer
[00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:19.880]   and as a podcast producer, he's the best.
[00:55:19.880 --> 00:55:21.240]   - But he's basically one of the only people
[00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:24.280]   on this whole team, so how do you find,
[00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:26.780]   I mean, when you let people in,
[00:55:26.780 --> 00:55:29.920]   I mean, I'm sure other people wanted to get involved,
[00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:32.160]   like why don't you have a co-host?
[00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:34.760]   You basically kind of, well--
[00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:36.320]   - Here's the problem with a co-host.
[00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:38.000]   Like when you and I are talking,
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:41.340]   when we're talking, I'm tuned in to you,
[00:55:41.340 --> 00:55:44.360]   and I'm waiting to hear what you're saying,
[00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:46.480]   and I'm listening, and I'm interpreting it,
[00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:48.840]   and then I'm calculating whether or not
[00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:52.640]   I have anything to say, whether to let you keep talking,
[00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:54.320]   whether I maybe have a question
[00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:56.160]   that lets you expand further,
[00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:58.480]   or whether I have a disagreement,
[00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:00.960]   or like there's a dance that's going on.
[00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:04.120]   Now when there's another person there chiming in too,
[00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:05.440]   it fucks the dance up.
[00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:09.600]   It's like dancing, like if you're doing a dance with someone
[00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:11.800]   like if you're slow dancing with someone,
[00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:13.280]   and then a third person's there
[00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:15.080]   stepping on everybody's feet. - It can be weird.
[00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:16.480]   - Sometimes it's fun.
[00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:18.120]   Sometimes having a third person is fun.
[00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:20.520]   Comedy podcast, sometimes it's fun.
[00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:22.040]   - Debate kind of structured. - Fight companions.
[00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:24.480]   Yeah, debate structures, but even then it gets difficult
[00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:25.840]   because people talk over each other,
[00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:30.520]   and also I find that without headphones
[00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:33.000]   it's way easier to talk over each other.
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:34.160]   You make mistakes.
[00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:36.080]   You don't hear it the same way.
[00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:38.760]   When you have headphones, I hear what you hear.
[00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:43.760]   It's all one sound, and the audience hears exactly,
[00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:46.720]   or rather I hear exactly what the audience hears.
[00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:50.240]   Whether it's over here, my voice is louder than yours
[00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:51.280]   'cause you're over there,
[00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:52.680]   and if I don't have headphones on,
[00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:54.360]   it's not all together.
[00:56:54.360 --> 00:56:56.560]   - On that point, one of the interesting things
[00:56:56.560 --> 00:57:01.120]   about your show is you don't, almost never have done,
[00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:02.800]   and you generally don't do remote,
[00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:04.880]   like, sorry, not remote calls,
[00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:07.500]   but you don't go to another person's location.
[00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:10.480]   - We've only done a few, a small handful.
[00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:13.880]   - And just like, well, Sapolsky, he should do this.
[00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:16.200]   But I actually, we went back and forth on email.
[00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:20.320]   I told him he needs to get his ass back in the studio.
[00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:21.480]   He's working on a book.
[00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:23.680]   - I was a fan of his a long time ago
[00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:26.280]   because I became obsessed with toxoplasmosis,
[00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:31.440]   and I reached out to him a long time ago
[00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:33.320]   before he was willing to do it,
[00:57:33.320 --> 00:57:35.760]   but then I caught him in downtown LA.
[00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:36.680]   He was there for something else,
[00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:40.520]   and I just greedily snatched up an hour of his time.
[00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:41.800]   - Well, he doesn't get, I think,
[00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:44.500]   some of those folks don't get how much magic can happen
[00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:45.520]   in this podcast studio,
[00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:48.440]   like, bigger than anything they've ever done
[00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:49.520]   in terms of their work.
[00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:51.080]   I'm not talking about reach,
[00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:54.000]   but in terms of the discovery of new ideas.
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.200]   There's something magical about conversation.
[00:57:58.040 --> 00:58:00.040]   Somebody as brilliant as him,
[00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:03.040]   if he gives himself over to the conversation
[00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:04.680]   for multiple hours at a time,
[00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:06.920]   that's another place where you've been an inspiration,
[00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:10.920]   where I'm getting more and more confidence
[00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:13.800]   of telling people, like Elon Musk,
[00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:16.440]   that a lot of CEOs are like,
[00:58:16.440 --> 00:58:19.080]   well, he has 30 minutes on his schedule.
[00:58:19.080 --> 00:58:22.080]   I'm like, no, three hours.
[00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:25.440]   (both laughing)
[00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:27.720]   And then they're like, so some say no,
[00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:28.560]   and then they come back.
[00:58:28.560 --> 00:58:30.280]   Those people have started coming back to like,
[00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:32.400]   okay, we're starting to get it.
[00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:33.720]   They start to get it,
[00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:37.000]   and you're a rare beacon of hope in that sense,
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.160]   that there's some value in long form.
[00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:41.440]   They think that nobody wants to listen
[00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:43.560]   for more than 30 minutes.
[00:58:43.560 --> 00:58:45.760]   They think, like, I have nothing to say,
[00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:49.400]   but the reality is, if you just give yourself over
[00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:52.320]   to the three hours, just let it go,
[00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:54.600]   three hours, four hours, whatever it is,
[00:58:54.600 --> 00:58:56.160]   there's so much to discover
[00:58:56.160 --> 00:58:58.560]   about what you didn't even know you think.
[00:58:58.560 --> 00:59:01.000]   - Yeah, yeah, you have to be confident
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:02.360]   that you could do it,
[00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:05.360]   and in the beginning, I just did it
[00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:07.360]   because that's what I wanted to do,
[00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:08.720]   and no one was listening.
[00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:12.320]   So I've always been a curious person,
[00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:16.760]   so I've always been interested in listening
[00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:18.200]   to how people think about things
[00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:21.720]   and talking to people about their mindset
[00:59:21.720 --> 00:59:24.800]   and just expanding on my own ideas,
[00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:26.360]   just talking shit.
[00:59:26.360 --> 00:59:28.400]   And so we would have these podcasts,
[00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:29.400]   and they would go on forever,
[00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:34.400]   and my friend Ari, I never let this die down.
[00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:37.000]   Never let him forget this.
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:38.520]   He was always like, "You have to edit your podcast.
[00:59:38.520 --> 00:59:40.160]   "I'm telling you right now, you're fucking up."
[00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:41.440]   I go, "Why?"
[00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:43.040]   He's like, "Because people are not gonna listen to it."
[00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:44.640]   I go, "They don't have to."
[00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:45.480]   - Yeah.
[00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:46.560]   - I go, "You can listen to part of it."
[00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:47.960]   He goes, "Just do it.
[00:59:47.960 --> 00:59:49.320]   "I'm telling you, trust me.
[00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:51.840]   "Cut it down to 45 minutes, that's all you need."
[00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:54.280]   And I'm like, "No, no, I don't think you're right."
[00:59:54.280 --> 00:59:56.440]   I go, "I like listening to long-form things.
[00:59:56.440 --> 00:59:57.880]   "No one has that kind of time."
[00:59:57.880 --> 01:00:01.480]   I go, "Okay, I'm just gonna keep doing it this way."
[01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:03.440]   - And so stick to your gut.
[01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:04.280]   - No, he doesn't.
[01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:06.480]   His are like two and a half hours long now.
[01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:07.680]   - That's great.
[01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:08.720]   You won.
[01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:10.080]   But you wouldn't, like say,
[01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:11.440]   I mentioned to you this before,
[01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:12.800]   and this is gonna happen.
[01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:14.440]   It's actually made a lot of progress towards it.
[01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:16.280]   I'm gonna talk to Putin,
[01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:19.040]   but you wouldn't travel to Putin if you wanted to talk to?
[01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:21.160]   - Putin's a dangerous character.
[01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:22.640]   - He's not.
[01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:23.480]   He's not--
[01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:24.320]   - Have you talked to,
[01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:26.440]   have you seen the thing with Jerry Craft
[01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:27.880]   where they stole his Super Bowl ring?
[01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:29.680]   - Yeah, yeah, those.
[01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:31.640]   I think that was a little bit of misunderstanding.
[01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:33.000]   - Oh, really?
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:33.840]   I think it's a little bit,
[01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:35.960]   he just decided he's gonna steal that Super Bowl ring.
[01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:36.800]   - Kind of.
[01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:37.640]   I think there was a--
[01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:38.480]   - Kind of.
[01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:39.760]   Can I see your ring?
[01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:40.600]   He shows him his ring,
[01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:41.440]   and then he puts it on and says,
[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:43.160]   "I can murder somebody with this ring."
[01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:44.640]   And then he walks off with it.
[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:46.000]   - It's possible he did it.
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:50.360]   He's a big believer in displays of power.
[01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:51.200]   - Yeah.
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:52.720]   - So it's possible he did that.
[01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:57.920]   I think he sees himself as a tool
[01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:00.240]   with which to demonstrate that Russia
[01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:03.560]   still belongs on the stage of the big players.
[01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:07.800]   And so a lot of actions are selected through that lens.
[01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:11.200]   But in terms of a human being,
[01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:16.040]   outside of any of the evils that he may or may not have done,
[01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:21.040]   he is a really thoughtful, intelligent, fun human being.
[01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:26.720]   The wit and the depth from the JRE perspective
[01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:27.600]   is really interesting.
[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:29.200]   I'm like his manager now, selling.
[01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:30.200]   (Luke laughs)
[01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:31.040]   He's a judo guy.
[01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:33.240]   - He's really good at judo.
[01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:35.240]   I have seen him practice judo.
[01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:36.320]   He's a legit black belt.
[01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:39.040]   - And not only that, he loves it.
[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:41.320]   Not just skill-wise, but to talk about it,
[01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:43.240]   to reason about it, to think about it,
[01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:44.520]   to MMA as well.
[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:47.600]   So, you know, it'd be a good conversation.
[01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:49.200]   But you wouldn't travel to him.
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:52.400]   (Luke laughs)
[01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:53.880]   - Well, that's, hold to your principles.
[01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:55.040]   So that's the core of the advice.
[01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:56.240]   Just hold to whatever--
[01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:58.840]   - I would rather, here's the thing.
[01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:04.200]   There's not a person that I have to have on the show.
[01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:06.340]   And I'm happy to talk to anybody.
[01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:08.240]   I'm just as happy to talk to you
[01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:10.000]   as I am to talk to Trump,
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.080]   as I am to, probably more happy to talk to you,
[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:13.800]   as I am to talk to Mike Tyson,
[01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:15.480]   as I am to talk to Joey Diaz.
[01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:17.120]   I like talking to people.
[01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:19.120]   I enjoy doing podcasts.
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:21.560]   I enjoy talking to a variety of people.
[01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:24.320]   And I schedule them based on,
[01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:26.520]   I wanna like, I try not to get too many
[01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:27.920]   right-wing people in a row,
[01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:29.520]   or too many progressive people in a row.
[01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:31.160]   I don't wanna get repetitive.
[01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:33.280]   I try not to get too many fighters in a row.
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:35.480]   I try to balance it out, not too many comedians.
[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:36.680]   Comedians are the one,
[01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:39.840]   one group where I can have three, four in a row,
[01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:42.160]   five in a row, 'cause that's my tribe.
[01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:43.360]   You know, those are my people.
[01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:44.220]   It's easy.
[01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:45.800]   We can talk about anything.
[01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:48.080]   It's a weird dance, you know?
[01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:50.080]   The conversations that you're doing on a podcast,
[01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:52.960]   they're a strange dance.
[01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:55.160]   And you wanna, you know,
[01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:56.920]   you wanna not step on your own feet.
[01:02:56.920 --> 01:03:00.760]   And you wanna make sure that you do it in a way,
[01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:02.920]   do the podcast in a way that's entertaining for people.
[01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:05.480]   And it's the conversations,
[01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:09.080]   or learning how to talk to people, it's a weird skill.
[01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:10.760]   It's a weird skill that took a long time
[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:11.800]   for me to get good at.
[01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:14.640]   And I didn't know it was a skill until I started doing it.
[01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:16.800]   And then I just thought you were just talking.
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:17.960]   Like, "Oh, I just, I know how to talk.
[01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:19.080]   "We'll just talk to people."
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:20.320]   And then along the way, I realized like,
[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:21.160]   "Oh."
[01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:23.160]   And then when you talk to people that are bad at it,
[01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:25.000]   you realize that it's a skill.
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.880]   Like particularly, one of the things about my people,
[01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:32.600]   about comedians is a lot of them tend to want to talk,
[01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:34.040]   but don't wanna listen.
[01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:35.160]   - Right.
[01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:38.620]   - So they're waiting for you to stop talking
[01:03:38.620 --> 01:03:39.520]   so they can talk,
[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:41.480]   but they're not necessarily thinking
[01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:43.560]   about what you're saying, you know?
[01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:45.860]   And they're just waiting for their opportunity,
[01:03:45.860 --> 01:03:47.680]   or they talk over you, or they,
[01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:49.280]   and I try real hard not to do that,
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:50.160]   and sometimes I fail,
[01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:55.000]   but when I'm at my best, I'm dancing.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.760]   - Yeah, ultimately the skill of conversation
[01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:59.280]   is just really listening.
[01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:00.120]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:02.080]   - Like really, and listening and thinking.
[01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:03.040]   - Listening and thinking.
[01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:05.320]   And being genuinely curious,
[01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:10.320]   and really having a take on what they're saying,
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:13.880]   and maybe a follow-up question,
[01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:15.960]   or maybe, you know, it's gotta be real.
[01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:17.080]   It's gotta be authentic.
[01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:19.160]   And when it is authentic and it's real,
[01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:20.640]   it resonates with people.
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:21.760]   Like they're listening and they go,
[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:25.320]   "Oh, like I'm locked in with the way you're thinking.
[01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:27.360]   "Like you two guys are in a conversation
[01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:28.840]   "and I'm locked in."
[01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:31.160]   You know, when she talks and you listen,
[01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:32.520]   I'm listening too.
[01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:34.440]   You know, when he says something to her,
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:36.580]   or when she says something to him,
[01:04:36.580 --> 01:04:39.080]   like there's a thing that happens during conversations
[01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:40.960]   where you're there.
[01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:42.360]   Like you're listening to,
[01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:45.600]   and it's with me, when I listen to a good podcast,
[01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:47.080]   I feel like I'm in the room.
[01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:50.000]   I feel like I'm in the room and I'm like the friend
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.600]   that got to sit down and listen.
[01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:54.840]   Like, "Oh, yeah, that's a great conversation."
[01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:56.320]   You know, I love conversations.
[01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:58.080]   So I love listening to them,
[01:04:58.080 --> 01:04:59.680]   and I love putting them together.
[01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:04.360]   And the fact that this podcast has gotten so fucking big,
[01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:06.400]   it's stunning to me.
[01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:07.520]   It blows me away.
[01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:09.320]   I never anticipated it.
[01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:11.920]   Never thought for a second that that stupid thing
[01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:15.080]   that I used to do on my couch, in my office,
[01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:18.520]   was the biggest thing I've ever done in my life, by far.
[01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:20.320]   Like people used to make fun of it.
[01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:22.760]   Like there's a Comedy Store documentary that's coming out,
[01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:24.680]   and one of the parts of the documentary is,
[01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:28.120]   my friend Tom Segura, when he first started doing my podcast,
[01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:30.520]   he would be leaving and he would talk to Red Band.
[01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:32.240]   He's like, "What the fuck is he doing?
[01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:33.400]   Like, why is he doing this?
[01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:34.240]   Like, who's listening?"
[01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:36.300]   He's like, "Oh, some people like it."
[01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:38.960]   And it's like fucking nonsense, waste of time.
[01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:43.080]   And like in the documentary, it shows like 2000 views,
[01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:45.160]   like one of the early Ustream episodes.
[01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:46.000]   - Hilarious.
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.400]   And they don't just like it, really.
[01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:50.400]   They form a friendship with you.
[01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:53.800]   It's like, even me, when people come up to me,
[01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:56.680]   like the love in their eyes is kind of beautiful.
[01:05:56.680 --> 01:05:57.560]   - It's weird, right?
[01:05:57.560 --> 01:05:58.400]   - Yeah, it's like-
[01:05:58.400 --> 01:05:59.320]   - You're a part of their life.
[01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:00.160]   - Yeah.
[01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:02.560]   And I don't know, it's also heartbreaking
[01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:06.560]   'cause you realize you'll never really get to know them back
[01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:09.840]   'cause they clearly are friends with you.
[01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:11.240]   - Yes, yeah.
[01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:13.920]   - And it's sad to see a person who's clearly brilliant
[01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:16.080]   and interesting and is friends with you,
[01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:20.240]   but you don't get a chance to return that love.
[01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:21.280]   And I mean-
[01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:23.200]   - My kids, it took them a while
[01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:24.940]   to figure out what's going on,
[01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:29.560]   but people would come up to me and they would say something
[01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:31.080]   like, "Hey man, I fucking love you.
[01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:31.920]   Thanks, man."
[01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:32.760]   I'm like, "All right.
[01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:34.060]   Hey, brother, nice to meet you."
[01:06:34.060 --> 01:06:35.040]   My daughter was like six.
[01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:36.520]   She'd be like, "Do you know him?"
[01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:37.800]   I'd be like, "No, I don't know him."
[01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:39.600]   She's like, "How does he know you?"
[01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:42.520]   (both laughing)
[01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:46.240]   Very weird conversation I used to have with young kids
[01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:49.000]   when I'd explain, I'd do this thing called a podcast
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.680]   and millions of people listened.
[01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:52.680]   So now one of my daughters is 12
[01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:56.600]   and one of her friends is 13 and he's a boy
[01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:59.080]   and he goes to school with her and he's obsessed with me.
[01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:01.180]   And so she's weirded out and she says to him,
[01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:02.360]   "I don't even think you like me.
[01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:05.000]   I think you're just into my dad, you fucking weirdo."
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.640]   - She's gonna have that conversation
[01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:09.040]   a few stages in her life.
[01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:12.080]   That hard conversation with a boyfriend.
[01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:13.320]   - Yeah, probably.
[01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:14.160]   Yeah.
[01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:16.120]   That's the thing about men too.
[01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:21.120]   This podcast is, my podcast is uniquely masculine.
[01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:26.400]   I'm a man and I'm not, I'm also a man
[01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:27.920]   that doesn't have to go through some sort
[01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:29.320]   of a corporate filter.
[01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:31.880]   I'm not going through executive producers
[01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:34.240]   who tell me, "Don't have this guest on.
[01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:36.000]   Don't talk about that."
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.440]   We looked at focus groups and they don't seem to like
[01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:39.600]   when you do this.
[01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:40.600]   There's none of that.
[01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:43.240]   I just do it.
[01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:46.880]   So I have a whole podcast where I just talk about cars
[01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:48.160]   and people are like, "I don't wanna hear you talk
[01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:49.000]   about cars."
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.920]   Well, good, congratulations.
[01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:51.920]   You found what you like.
[01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:52.880]   Here's good news.
[01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:54.640]   There's 1500 other ones.
[01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:55.760]   Go listen to the other episodes
[01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:57.320]   where I don't talk about cars.
[01:07:57.320 --> 01:07:58.780]   You don't have to listen.
[01:07:58.780 --> 01:08:02.920]   - And it's not like your brand, you just are who you are
[01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:04.040]   and that's what you do.
[01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:08.560]   - But it's like, it's authentically what I'm interested in.
[01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:11.440]   All the podcasts, whether I'm talking to David Fravor
[01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:13.360]   about his experience with UFOs,
[01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:17.760]   whether I'm talking to David Sinclair about life extension,
[01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:20.280]   whether I'm talking to you about artificial intelligence
[01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:23.560]   or whatever, it's because I want to talk to these people.
[01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:25.680]   And that resonates.
[01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:28.640]   I like when people are into shit.
[01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:30.440]   I've talked about this before, like things that I have
[01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:32.280]   no interest in making furniture,
[01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:34.120]   but I like this PBS show where this guy
[01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:35.800]   makes furniture by hand.
[01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:36.640]   I love watching it.
[01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:37.480]   - Craftsman.
[01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:38.300]   - 'Cause he's so into it.
[01:08:38.300 --> 01:08:39.960]   He's sanding this and polishing that.
[01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:40.920]   I'm not gonna do that.
[01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:42.720]   I don't give a fuck about furniture.
[01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:45.400]   Furniture for me is function, like this desk.
[01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:48.680]   Function works, but I love when people are into it.
[01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:50.520]   And I'm happy that someone can make it
[01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:54.360]   and they do a great job, but I'm not interested
[01:08:54.360 --> 01:08:59.040]   in the task or even the finished product
[01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:01.880]   as much as I'm interested in someone's passion for something.
[01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:03.640]   - The passion that they've put into this,
[01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:05.280]   that shines through.
[01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:06.200]   Last question.
[01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:11.720]   I sometimes ask this just for to, what is it?
[01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:15.280]   To challenge, to make people roll their eyes,
[01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:17.400]   to make legitimate scientists roll their eyes.
[01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:20.400]   Ask, what is the meaning of life?
[01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:22.160]   According to Joe Rogan.
[01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:24.440]   - I do not think there is a meaning.
[01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:26.880]   I think there's many, many meanings of life.
[01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:30.060]   I think there's a way to navigate life that's enjoyable.
[01:09:30.060 --> 01:09:32.320]   I think it requires many things.
[01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:35.040]   It requires, first of all, it requires love.
[01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:36.440]   You have to have loved ones.
[01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:37.740]   You have to have family.
[01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:38.960]   You have to have friends.
[01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:40.720]   You have to have people that care about you
[01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:42.260]   and you have to care about them.
[01:09:42.260 --> 01:09:44.600]   I think that is primary.
[01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:47.800]   Then it also requires interests.
[01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:50.040]   There has to be things that stimulate you.
[01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:52.720]   Now it could be just a subsistence lifestyle.
[01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:55.360]   There's many people that believe and practice
[01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:59.260]   this lifestyle of just living off the land
[01:09:59.260 --> 01:10:01.360]   and hunting and fishing and living in the woods
[01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:03.440]   and they seem incredibly happy.
[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:05.720]   And there's something to be said for that.
[01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:07.280]   That is an interest, right?
[01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:10.200]   There's something and there's a direct connection
[01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:12.760]   between their actions and their sustenance.
[01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:14.440]   They get their food that way.
[01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:15.640]   They're connected to nature
[01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:18.120]   and it's very satisfying for them.
[01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:21.840]   If you don't have that, I think you need something
[01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:24.060]   that is interesting to you,
[01:10:24.060 --> 01:10:26.520]   something that you're passionate about.
[01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:27.920]   And there's far too many people
[01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:30.120]   that get sucked into living a life
[01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:33.280]   where you're just doing a job.
[01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:35.100]   You're just showing up and putting in your time
[01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:35.940]   and then going home.
[01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:37.880]   But you don't have a passion for what you're doing.
[01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:42.100]   And I think that's the recipe for a boring
[01:10:42.100 --> 01:10:43.640]   and very unfulfilling life.
[01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:46.340]   - You mentioned love, if we could just backtrack.
[01:10:46.340 --> 01:10:49.440]   We talked about the demons
[01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:51.680]   and the violence in there somewhere.
[01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:55.520]   What's the role of love in your own life?
[01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:57.240]   - It's very important, man.
[01:10:57.240 --> 01:10:59.440]   And that's one of the reasons why
[01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:04.160]   I'm so interested in helping people.
[01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:07.640]   I'm very interested in people feeling good.
[01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:09.360]   I like them to feel good.
[01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:10.520]   I want to help them.
[01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:12.560]   I like doing things that make them feel like,
[01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:13.520]   oh, you care about me.
[01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:14.760]   Like, yeah, I care about you.
[01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:15.640]   I really do.
[01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:17.140]   Like, I want people to feel good.
[01:11:17.140 --> 01:11:19.040]   I want my family to feel good.
[01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:20.280]   I want my friends to feel good.
[01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:23.740]   I want guests to feel good about the podcast experience.
[01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:28.080]   I'm a big believer in as much as I can
[01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:32.320]   to spread positive energy and joy and happiness
[01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:35.680]   and relay all the good advice that I've ever gotten.
[01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:37.640]   All the things that I've learned,
[01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:38.840]   and if they can benefit people,
[01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:41.080]   then I find that those things benefit people
[01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:43.080]   and actually improve the quality of their life
[01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:46.880]   or improve their success or improve their relationships.
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:48.480]   I'm very happy to do that.
[01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:49.820]   That means a lot to me.
[01:11:49.820 --> 01:11:53.960]   The way we interact with each other is so important.
[01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:55.840]   It's one of the reasons why, like,
[01:11:55.840 --> 01:11:58.920]   someone gets canceled or you get publicly shamed.
[01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:00.160]   It's so devastating,
[01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:02.600]   because there's all these people that negative,
[01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:04.520]   all this negative energy coming your way,
[01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:05.340]   and you feel it.
[01:12:05.340 --> 01:12:07.640]   As much as I like to pretend that you're immune
[01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:08.460]   to that kind of stuff,
[01:12:08.460 --> 01:12:10.960]   and some people do like to pretend that, you feel it.
[01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:14.560]   There's a tangible force when people are upset at you.
[01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:17.840]   And that's the same with loved ones or family
[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:20.080]   or anytime someone's upset at you,
[01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:22.220]   whether it's a giant group of people
[01:12:22.220 --> 01:12:23.940]   or there's a small amount of people,
[01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:27.000]   that has an impact on you and your psyche
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.880]   and your physical being.
[01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:31.840]   So the more you can spread love
[01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:34.160]   and the more love comes back to you,
[01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:36.800]   you also create this butterfly effect, right?
[01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:39.200]   Where other people start recognizing like,
[01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:42.280]   oh, you know, when he's nice to me, I feel better,
[01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:43.960]   and then I'm gonna be nicer to people.
[01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:45.840]   And when I'm nicer to people, they feel better
[01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:48.200]   and I feel better, and it spreads outward.
[01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:49.380]   And that's one thing that I've done
[01:12:49.380 --> 01:12:50.480]   through this podcast, I think,
[01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:53.620]   is I've imparted my personal philosophy
[01:12:53.620 --> 01:12:57.300]   in kindness and generosity to other people.
[01:12:57.300 --> 01:13:00.260]   - Yeah, I mean, to correct you, you didn't do it.
[01:13:00.260 --> 01:13:02.460]   The ideas that are breeding themselves through your brain
[01:13:02.460 --> 01:13:04.100]   have figured out. - Yes, the ideas
[01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:05.700]   that are alive in the air
[01:13:05.700 --> 01:13:07.260]   that made their way into my head.
[01:13:07.260 --> 01:13:09.940]   - Love is a more efficient mechanism of spreading ideas
[01:13:09.940 --> 01:13:11.020]   they figured out.
[01:13:11.020 --> 01:13:13.340]   - Yes. (laughs)
[01:13:13.340 --> 01:13:16.140]   Probably, man, probably.
[01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:21.140]   So as far as like the meaning of life,
[01:13:21.140 --> 01:13:23.820]   without that, you have nothing.
[01:13:23.820 --> 01:13:26.040]   You know, one of the biggest failures in life
[01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:27.900]   is to be extremely successful financially,
[01:13:27.900 --> 01:13:29.260]   but everybody hates you.
[01:13:29.260 --> 01:13:31.020]   Everybody hates you and you're just miserable
[01:13:31.020 --> 01:13:33.840]   and alone and angry and depressed and sad.
[01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:35.880]   You know, when you hear about rich, famous people
[01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:39.340]   that commit suicide, like, wow, you missed the mark.
[01:13:39.340 --> 01:13:41.600]   You got some parts right,
[01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:44.120]   but you put too many eggs in one basket.
[01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:46.800]   You put too many eggs in the financial basket
[01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:49.800]   or the success basket or the accomplishment basket
[01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:52.080]   and not enough in the friendship and love basket.
[01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:53.660]   And there's a balance to that.
[01:13:53.660 --> 01:13:56.880]   And when I talked about the violence and all that stuff,
[01:13:56.880 --> 01:14:00.360]   like that to me is me, understanding and recognizing that
[01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:02.880]   is me trying to achieve that balance.
[01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:05.400]   It's like, go kill those demons
[01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:07.460]   so that this boat is level, you know?
[01:14:07.460 --> 01:14:09.580]   Because if it's not, then the boat is like this
[01:14:09.580 --> 01:14:10.840]   and then everything's all fucked up.
[01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:13.200]   And every time we hit a wave, things fall apart.
[01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:15.080]   Balance that boat out, figure it out.
[01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:16.720]   Like, know who you are.
[01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:18.780]   Some people don't have that problem at all.
[01:14:18.780 --> 01:14:20.520]   Some people, they could just go for walks
[01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:22.160]   and they're cool as a cucumber.
[01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:23.620]   I need more, you know?
[01:14:23.620 --> 01:14:24.840]   I need kettlebells.
[01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:26.280]   I need a heavy bag.
[01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:29.680]   I need the echo bike, you know, the air assault bike.
[01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:31.800]   I need some hardcore shit.
[01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:33.800]   And if I don't get that, I don't feel good.
[01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:35.600]   So I figured that out too.
[01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:37.760]   And that makes me a nicer person.
[01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:39.400]   That makes my interactions nicer.
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:44.280]   It changes the quality of my friendships
[01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:46.360]   and my relationships with people.
[01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:49.200]   - I think we mentioned Neuralink.
[01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:53.080]   I can certainly guarantee that this is one of the memories
[01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:55.680]   I'll be replaying 20, 30 years from now
[01:14:55.680 --> 01:14:57.040]   once we get the feature ready.
[01:14:57.040 --> 01:14:58.920]   Joe, it's a huge honor to talk to you.
[01:14:58.920 --> 01:14:59.760]   I hope-- - It's an honor
[01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:00.600]   to talk to you too, man. - Keep doing our podcast.
[01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:02.920]   - I'm glad you came down here for this.
[01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:04.760]   The first week of me doing this here.
[01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:07.640]   And it's very cool to have you always.
[01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:10.240]   I hope you make Texas cool again
[01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:14.920]   and do your podcast another 10, 11, whatever,
[01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:17.160]   however many years you're still on this earth.
[01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:18.000]   - All right, thank you, brother.
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:19.760]   - Thanks, man. - Appreciate you, man.
