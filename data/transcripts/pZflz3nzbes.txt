[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:12.240]   Paul's second epistle to the Corinthians in the fourth chapter, in reading the first
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.280]   six verses.
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.760]   The first six verses in the fourth chapter of Paul's second epistle to the Corinthians.
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:28.640]   "Therefore, seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not, but
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.480]   have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:42.000]   word of God deceitfully, but, by manifestation of the truth, commending ourselves to every
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.840]   man's conscience in the sight of God.
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.440]   But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost, in whom the God of this world
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.800]   hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.720]   of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:09.160]   For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord, and ourselves you are servants for
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.360]   Jesus' sake.
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:18.480]   For God who commended the light to shine out of darkness hath shined in our hearts to give
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:25.800]   the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ."
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:38.240]   Now we come back to a consideration of those words, those six verses, for the sixth time.
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:45.520]   But I have been careful each Sunday night to read the entire six verses, because I think
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.400]   it must have become abundantly plain and clear that in a sense we cannot understand any one
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:57.320]   of the particular statements except "in the light of the whole."
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.360]   And so I have read the six verses once more, although this evening we are only going to
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:09.240]   consider one further aspect of this truth that the Apostle puts here before us.
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:15.400]   Now here in these verses, as we have been seeing, the Apostle does something which was
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.720]   a little bit unusual for him.
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.880]   He talks about himself, and about his ministry, and about his method of preaching.
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.680]   We need not be concerned again to go into his reasons for that, but the fact is that
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:36.680]   here he tells us how it was he preached, and why he preached in that particular way.
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.060]   The manner was, as we notice, that he had renounced the hidden things of dishonesty.
[00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.160]   There was no trickery about his preaching.
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.240]   He did not imply any of the arts.
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.240]   Now in doing that, the Apostle was doing something very unusual in that ancient world.
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.720]   The Greek philosophers and rhetoricians, they paid great attention to art and to the form
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.200]   in which a message was presented.
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.200]   The Apostle did not.
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.120]   He is not concerned about what people may think of him.
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.560]   He has determined not to know anything among them, save Jesus Christ and him crucified.
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.440]   In his speech and his preaching, he says he is not with enticing words of men's wisdom,
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.280]   but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power.
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.200]   He has used no tricks, no artistry.
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.400]   He has gone out of his way to avoid anything and everything that might attract people unto
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.680]   him rather than unto the truth itself.
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.520]   He does not handle the word of God deceitfully, he says, and he tells us why not.
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.640]   And we have been looking into this.
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.320]   He says the whole thing is much too serious for that.
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.960]   It's all being done in the sight of God.
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.580]   And he will have to give an account to God for what he has done.
[00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:57.560]   Not only that, he is concerned about the people, because he reminds them that they likewise
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.940]   are listening in the sight of God.
[00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.440]   And they will have to give an account as to how they have listened.
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.520]   Of course, this is not peculiar to the Apostle Paul.
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.760]   The Lord Jesus Christ said exactly the same thing.
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.360]   "Take heed," he said, "how ye hear."
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.000]   It's a tremendous thing, this.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.660]   That's what makes a service like this such an important and such a serious matter.
[00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:26.400]   We shall have to give an account in eternity of the way in which we have listened to the
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.240]   message of the Christian gospel.
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.280]   Our Lord himself said that quite plainly.
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.100]   He said, "Think not that I shall condemn you."
[00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:42.960]   He said, "The words that I have spoken unto you, they shall judge you."
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.160]   Very well, this Apostle says exactly the same thing here.
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.400]   He is aware of the seriousness of the whole situation.
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:56.680]   But the great thing that he tells us is this, that he preaches in this way in order that
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.560]   he might manifest the truth.
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.920]   He wants people to have a view of this truth.
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:08.800]   And he seems to say, "God forbid that I in any shape or form should stand between
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.020]   people and this truth."
[00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.200]   As I've used the illustration, let me repeat it.
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.600]   He is just a little man who draws back the curtains and that the people may see the truth.
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:18.800]   He doesn't stand between them.
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.420]   He gets out of sight.
[00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.600]   He doesn't call attention to himself.
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:28.160]   He just wants to manifest this great and glorious truth.
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:33.480]   And of course, you can't read these words of his without seeing that he was tremendously
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.480]   moved as he did this.
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.280]   He tells us elsewhere that he magnifies his office.
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.640]   He felt he'd got the greatest privilege that a man could ever have, to handle the
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:49.880]   word of God, to reveal, to manifest this glorious truth.
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:55.120]   He's thrilled by it, and that's why he tells us that he travels day and night, crosses
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:01.680]   oceans, preaches incontinence, indefatigable, well, because of the glory of the gospel.
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.520]   You notice he plays with this word "glorious."
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.940]   It's all so glorious.
[00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:07.940]   And what is it?
[00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.800]   Well, we've been looking into this.
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:17.520]   This gospel, he tells us, is light, the light of the knowledge.
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:22.640]   See, that is the business of preaching, to give knowledge, to give information, to enlighten
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.400]   people.
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:29.640]   According to the Bible, we are all born in darkness, we are all blind, and we need to
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:30.640]   be enlightened.
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.640]   We are all ignorant, we need knowledge.
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:37.120]   And says Paul, "I've got it, the Lord Jesus Christ gave it me.
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.320]   It isn't mine, he gave it me.
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:44.120]   Revelation was given to me," he says, "and he's now giving them the light of the knowledge."
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:45.600]   He'd received it.
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:50.440]   God, who commended the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts to
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:55.440]   give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:58.960]   And I now, he said, am passing it on to you.
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.760]   And he says this is the most important thing in the world.
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:02.760]   Why?
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.680]   Well, because of the knowledge it gives us.
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:05.680]   And what's that?
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:09.400]   Well, it gives us a knowledge about ourselves.
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:14.880]   It tells us that we're all by nature, as things were at the very beginning of creation.
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:20.240]   You go back to the second verse in the Bible, the second verse in the first chapter of Genesis,
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:26.040]   and you read that the earth was without form and void.
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:29.520]   And it would have remained like that were it not that God said, "Let there be light,"
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.720]   and then the whole process began.
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:35.280]   That's that we are by nature.
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:39.840]   And then we see that it gives us knowledge concerning the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:44.800]   We preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord.
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:50.200]   "Lest," he says, "the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:53.120]   God, should shine unto them."
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.880]   It's knowledge about what God has done in his Son.
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:02.480]   And then we saw that it was light and the knowledge of the glory of God himself.
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:07.760]   The greatest need of the whole world tonight is to know God.
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:10.480]   There's no greater need than that.
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:15.200]   Everything is as it is tonight because men and women don't know God.
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.840]   You see, they're all fighting for their own glory.
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.720]   Nations are fighting for their own glory.
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.800]   People behind one curtain, it's their glory.
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.720]   On the other side, it's our glory.
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:28.960]   And everybody's out for glory, always our own glory in some shape or form.
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:36.280]   And that's why the world is full of division, full of war and threats of war, full of jealousy
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:41.560]   and envy and spite and malice and hatred, man out for his own glory and every other
[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:42.560]   man the same.
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:44.800]   And why are they all like this?
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:51.320]   There's only one answer, because they're ignorant of the glory of God.
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:58.360]   If only we had a glimpse of the glory of God, we'd fall on our faces before him.
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:03.640]   We like Isaiah would say, "Woe is unto me, for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:07.200]   among a people of unclean lips."
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:13.720]   All this false pride and desire for glory would go, and we'd all be worshipping God
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:16.520]   and seeking to know his will and his way.
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:23.160]   Now then, says Paul, there's only one way to know this glory of God, and it is in the
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:26.600]   face of Jesus Christ.
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.280]   This is the knowledge.
[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:33.000]   And then he goes on to give us a further bit, and that's what I'm dealing with this evening.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:40.840]   And that is, of course, the nature of the Christian life into which we come as the result
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:46.920]   of this knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:53.240]   And here is something which is very wonderful, the nature of the Christian life itself.
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:10:01.000]   Now, here once more, the great trouble, of course, is due to ignorance.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.400]   Everybody thinks he knows what it is to be a Christian.
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:09.160]   Everybody seems to take it for granted that they know all about this.
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:13.480]   "Oh yes," they say, "Christianity as it's doing good," or this or that.
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:19.080]   Indeed I was reading in a paper only this last week that a man who has written a book
[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:25.360]   saying why he isn't a Christian is indeed giving a lead to all Christians at the present
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:30.720]   time because he sits down on the street in Whitehall or something like that.
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:34.560]   You see, that's the popular idea as to what Christianity is.
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:38.000]   We think we know what Christianity is, but you know the apostle says the great trouble
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.720]   is people don't know what it is, and therefore he tells them exactly what it is.
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:48.080]   You see, this is good news, he says, and the good news is never negative.
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.760]   Good news!
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:51.160]   Gospel!
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:55.960]   The most thrilling good news that a man can ever have.
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.440]   Light on this!
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:03.800]   Paul, you remember, in writing to the Galatians, compares himself to a sort of bill poster
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.040]   or a man who puts up placards.
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.480]   He says, "I have placarded the gospel."
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:13.480]   Well, that's because it's good news, and therefore we've got this good news which
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:14.960]   we can look at together.
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:18.760]   Now then, it's all in Jesus Christ.
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:21.820]   You see the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:22.820]   What do we see?
[00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:23.820]   Well, we've seen this.
[00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:28.720]   We've seen that in him and in him alone we have forgiveness.
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:32.000]   There's no hope of forgiveness apart from him.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.400]   There is no hope of being reconciled to God apart from the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:44.840]   God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:45.840]   them.
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:53.200]   This is good news, that it is possible for us to be forgiven, to become reconciled unto
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:58.640]   God, and to begin to live a new kind of life.
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:02.400]   Now then, the question is, what kind of life is this?
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:04.760]   What is Christianity?
[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:06.120]   What is it to be a Christian?
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.120]   How does one ever become a Christian?
[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:11.360]   Here is the great question.
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:16.000]   I wonder what our ideas are this evening, one by one.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:22.600]   Well let me hold before you briefly what the Apostle tells us about this great matter.
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:31.520]   The first thing he tells us is this, that our becoming Christian is the result of a
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:38.400]   great creative act on the part of God.
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:42.160]   That's our first proposition.
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:48.600]   God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, has shined in our hearts to give
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:54.520]   the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:13:00.180]   You see, he's back in Genesis, the first chapter of Genesis, the second verse.
[00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:01.800]   And we've got to go back there.
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.920]   You'll never understand what a Christian is unless you go back to the account of the
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:08.480]   creation in the first chapter of the book of Genesis.
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.720]   You've got to go back to the beginning.
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:15.320]   Because according to the Apostle, a man becomes a Christian because God has done something
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:20.000]   which is comparable to what he did there at the beginning.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:27.880]   God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, this same God has shined in our
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:28.880]   hearts.
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:34.040]   Now then, this is obviously basic and fundamental.
[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:35.040]   What does it tell us?
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:42.400]   Well, it tells us this, that no man can ever make himself a Christian.
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:46.920]   It tells us that no man can ever make any other man a Christian.
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:51.800]   It is not at all the activity of man.
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:56.400]   It is God's activity, God's creative activity.
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:59.400]   Isn't it here as plain as daylight?
[00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:05.480]   He says it is the same God who there, when he looked at this earth which was without
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:13.920]   form and void, said, "Let there be light," and produced the order out of the chaos, created.
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:18.040]   The same God has done something similar to me, says Paul.
[00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:22.400]   And that is why I am what I am, and that is why I am preaching this gospel.
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:26.840]   You had it again in that tenth verse of that second chapter of the epistle to the Ephesians
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:28.280]   that we read just now.
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:35.360]   We are his workmanship, created anew in Christ Jesus.
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:37.400]   Now this is absolutely basic.
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:42.320]   There are so many people who seem to think that by living a good life they make themselves
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:43.320]   Christians.
[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:45.720]   My dear friend, it's all wrong.
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.960]   That is the lie of the devil.
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:53.760]   It doesn't matter what you do, you'll never make yourself a Christian.
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:58.420]   Living a good life doesn't do it, doing acts of charity doesn't do it.
[00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:03.680]   You may even lay down your life for a cause, you don't make yourself a Christian, and
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:05.880]   nobody else can make you a Christian.
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:09.840]   You know, this apostle is very concerned about this point.
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:14.520]   He is very careful to say that even he couldn't make anybody else a Christian.
[00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:16.680]   You know, men today talk about their converts.
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:19.080]   The apostle never did.
[00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:20.560]   This is how he puts it.
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:24.640]   In writing in the previous chapter he puts it like this, "Ye are our epistle written
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:29.400]   in our hearts, known and read of all men, forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:37.800]   be the epistle of Christ, ministered by us, but written not with ink, but with the Spirit
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:44.080]   of the living God, not in tables of stone, but in the fleshy tables of the heart."
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:46.300]   Now there it is again, a perfect statement.
[00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:48.880]   The apostle says, "You know, I haven't written."
[00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:51.040]   He is describing Christians there as letters.
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:53.360]   He says, "I didn't write you."
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:58.440]   He says, "Ministered by us," which I always feel means something like this, as if the
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:01.680]   apostle was saying, "You know, I didn't really write you.
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:05.520]   I was given the privilege of holding the fountain pen, as it were, but there was another hand
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:07.880]   on top of mine that did the writing.
[00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:14.000]   Epistles of Christ, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God."
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.760]   Even Paul couldn't make a man a Christian.
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:20.040]   You see, men can do many things, we can persuade one another.
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:24.160]   That's why men speak, that's why they address people, isn't it?
[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:26.840]   That's why the politicians hold their meetings, they're trying to persuade people to vote
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:28.680]   for them and not for somebody else.
[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:32.640]   That's why you have lectures of instruction, and men can persuade men's minds to do many
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:35.480]   things, that's all right.
[00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:40.400]   But you see, that isn't the sort of thing that happens when a man becomes a Christian.
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:43.560]   It's much too big for that.
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:47.080]   This is something that God alone can do.
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:54.360]   We are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus, and to good works that we should walk in them.
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:17:01.080]   No, no, it is God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness.
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:05.280]   The apostle Paul didn't, at a given point, having thought about it all, decide to stop
[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:07.720]   being a Pharisee and to begin becoming a Christian.
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:10.480]   That isn't what happened to him at all.
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:15.480]   He says, "I was apprehended, I was laid hold of," and he was.
[00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:20.400]   He was going down to Damascus determined to exterminate Christianity, and God in Christ
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:23.200]   laid hold on him, did something to him.
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:28.240]   It's God's act, and nothing less.
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:35.520]   Now then, this, surely you will agree, is a very basic consideration.
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:42.200]   We've got to get rid of that foolish notion that by just being or doing something, "I
[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:46.600]   am, yes, I want to make this plan, let me throw this into it."
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:49.800]   Even coming to a place of worship doesn't make us Christians.
[00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:53.360]   Even having our names on church rolls doesn't make us Christians.
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:55.480]   You can be a heathen and a church member.
[00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:57.720]   There are many such.
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:02.280]   God knows most of us have been such at one time or another.
[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:04.280]   It's amazing how people go on holding to this.
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:05.400]   I'm very concerned about this.
[00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:10.040]   I was reading in a certain booklet this last week.
[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:16.080]   A young man who'd come over to this country from a country in Africa gives his experience,
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:21.120]   and he says in writing this that he came to this church amongst others.
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:25.000]   But this is what he says, to my amazement and astonishment, and you've got to blame
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.400]   him if I'm hammering this point this evening.
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:32.040]   Apparently the main result he came to as the result of listening to my preaching here was
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:37.720]   this, that if he only did his work as well as he could and as conscientiously as he could
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:41.960]   as a doctor, that he'd be all right with God.
[00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:43.720]   That's the impression I gave him, so long.
[00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:48.360]   And yet I thought that I stand here every Sunday to tell people very plainly and bluntly
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:52.360]   that it doesn't matter how much they do, they'll never make themselves Christians.
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:55.920]   And yet he listened to me Sunday after Sunday and went away deciding if only he lived a
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:59.560]   good life and did his work as well as he could as a doctor, God would be well pleased with
[00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:01.000]   him.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.760]   So I have to say it again.
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:07.240]   And you see the fact that a man could do a thing like that is a proof of what I'm saying
[00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:08.240]   now.
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:12.400]   It's obvious that no words of a preacher can ever make man a Christian.
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:16.320]   Men can listen to what I'm saying and think the opposite.
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:21.040]   And he was even praising me as he was saying all this, that's what really makes it so extraordinary.
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:24.000]   But it's a proof of this, you see.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.640]   It is God's action.
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:30.160]   A man can't do it himself, nobody else can do it for him.
[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:36.520]   It is a creative act of God the Almighty, God who commended the light to shine out of
[00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:37.520]   darkness.
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:40.760]   So I go on to my second point which reinforces the first.
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:46.960]   It's this, that this business of becoming a Christian is a great mystery.
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:49.600]   It's a marvellous matter.
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:53.920]   Indeed it's a miraculous matter.
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:57.800]   You know that the world is as it is because people don't know what it is to be a Christian.
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:01.800]   "Oh, I was always brought up to go to chapel and I always was taken to Sunday school as
[00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:02.800]   a child.
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:05.080]   I was taught my Bible, I was taught to say my prayers and I was..."
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:06.080]   That's it.
[00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:07.080]   And that's how you become a Christian.
[00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:10.680]   It's very largely an accident as to whether your father or mother were Christians or not.
[00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:14.600]   It depends upon whether you were born in Great Britain or in Central Africa or in Japan,
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:16.920]   whether you were brought up in a Christian or a non-Christian.
[00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:17.920]   It's just an accident.
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:21.960]   "Oh, what a tragedy that men should regard that as Christianity."
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:22.960]   What is it?
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:23.960]   Well, it's a miracle.
[00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:25.880]   It's the most marvellous thing in the world.
[00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:29.760]   It is God creating.
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:35.480]   And I say it's a marvellous and a mysterious thing.
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:39.760]   Didn't our Lord make that point very plain and clear in preaching to Nicodemus?
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:43.120]   Poor Nicodemus.
[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:46.960]   He was trying to understand Christianity like all of us try to do.
[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:52.720]   "And our Lord said to him, 'Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.'"
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:53.720]   "Ah," says Nicodemus.
[00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:57.840]   "You mean then, do you, that a man can be born when he's old?
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:01.120]   Can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born?"
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:04.640]   "No, no," said Christ.
[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:09.360]   "Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God."
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:10.360]   "Listen," he said.
[00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:16.440]   "That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit."
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:21.560]   "Marvel not that I said unto thee, 'Ye must be born again.'"
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:27.720]   "The wind bloweth where it listeth; though hearest the sound thereof, it canst not tell
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:30.200]   whence it cometh, nor whither it goeth."
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:33.880]   "So is every one that is born of the Spirit."
[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:37.200]   Nicodemus said, "Our Lord, you are trying to understand something that can never be
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.200]   understood."
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:42.720]   He said, "This is something marvellous, this is."
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:46.880]   You mustn't be marvelling at it because it is marvellous.
[00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:48.240]   You see, you are trying to understand it.
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:51.080]   Don't you say, "How can these things be?"
[00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:58.480]   Do you, Nicodemus, understand how God could create the world by just saying, "Let there
[00:21:58.480 --> 00:21:59.840]   be light"?
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:04.280]   When you understand that, you will understand how a man enters into my kingdom.
[00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:07.480]   He says it is not a matter of understanding.
[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:08.480]   This is God's action.
[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:09.480]   It is a miraculous action.
[00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:10.480]   It is a supernatural action.
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:17.040]   It is God, I say, the Creator, who said, "Let there be light," again saying it, and this
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:22.720]   mysterious marvellous thing takes place, Spirit, wonderful like the wind.
[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:26.480]   You can't see it, you see its effects, and you are astonished and amazed, but you don't
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:27.560]   know what has been happening.
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:33.160]   You can't dissect the inscrutable, you can't analyse the supernatural, you just look on
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.160]   in amazement.
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:37.640]   That is what it is to be a Christian.
[00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:40.760]   But how many of us think of Christianity like that?
[00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:44.760]   Always grown up into it, always been a Christian, always tried to do good, always tried not
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:45.760]   to do certain things.
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:51.000]   That is not Christianity, that is morality.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.480]   It is almost the exact opposite of Christianity.
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:57.080]   This is Christianity.
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:59.720]   The Apostle Paul is constantly saying the same thing.
[00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:03.760]   In writing his first epistle to the Corinthians, he almost devotes a whole chapter to it.
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:08.520]   It is the second chapter, the most important chapter for the modern generation.
[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:12.440]   Listen to him saying this, "The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of
[00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:14.560]   God for they are foolishness unto him.
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:18.240]   Neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned.
[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:26.200]   But he that is spiritual, he judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man."
[00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:27.200]   What does he mean?
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.200]   He means this.
[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:33.360]   That a man who is not a Christian doesn't understand Christianity and he doesn't understand
[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:34.360]   Christian people.
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:38.520]   He doesn't know what's the matter with them, he doesn't understand them, he can't explain
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:39.520]   them.
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:41.560]   Now that's the essence of this Christian position.
[00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:45.960]   It is indeed, I say, something marvelous and something which is done to us.
[00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:51.260]   Now that's what I want to emphasize.
[00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:59.580]   What makes a man a Christian is not anything that he does, it is what is done to him.
[00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:02.880]   You can't decide to be a Christian.
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:07.720]   The moment you take that decision, so-called, and announce that you are a Christian, you
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:13.040]   are giving proof that God has done something to you.
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:20.640]   God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined into our hearts.
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:23.200]   He's repeated what he did of old.
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:25.000]   It's God who's done it.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.760]   And you see, this follows, therefore, doesn't it, of necessity.
[00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:37.000]   Because it is God's action, and because it is thus marvelous and supernatural and miraculous,
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:42.920]   it is something that we don't understand even about ourselves.
[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:47.480]   This is becoming more and more my favorite definition of a Christian.
[00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:48.480]   What is a Christian?
[00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:53.960]   Well, I don't know of any better definition of a Christian than just this.
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:58.760]   A Christian is a man who doesn't understand himself.
[00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:02.880]   A Christian is a man who's amazed at himself.
[00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:06.360]   He's a man who's astonished at himself.
[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:09.680]   He's a man who says, "Is it possible that I am this man?
[00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:12.120]   I can scarcely believe it."
[00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:13.120]   Why does he feel that?
[00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:14.800]   Well, he feels that for this reason.
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:19.200]   God has done this amazing thing to him and in him, and he's as it were a spectator.
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:23.560]   He's aware that it's happened, but he doesn't understand it.
[00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:28.040]   He's a man, you see, who had perhaps for years been trying to pull himself together, trying
[00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:32.920]   to haul himself up out of sin, trying to get understanding, trying to live a better life,
[00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:37.200]   but failing, going back, everything seeming worse and worse.
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:41.920]   Then suddenly he finds himself a new man, and he says, "What's happened?
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:42.920]   I don't know myself.
[00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:44.880]   I can scarcely believe I am the same man."
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:47.480]   That's what makes a man a Christian.
[00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:53.760]   Now, you know, that's New Testament Christianity.
[00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:59.760]   A Christian is a man who's astonished and astounded at himself.
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:05.320]   If you, my friend, can explain yourself always, and if you can always understand yourself,
[00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:09.960]   well, you can take it from me, you've never been a Christian at all.
[00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:14.280]   You're just one of those nice self-contained little people who just happen to be born like
[00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:18.440]   that and they keep everything within limits, and they can give an explanation of everything.
[00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:20.380]   They never know what it is to be astonished.
[00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:28.080]   They never know what it is to stand back astounded and say, "Oh, the riches of the wisdom,
[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:34.960]   both of the knowledge and of the wisdom of God, oh, the depth of the riches."
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:40.080]   They never know what it is to say with this great apostle, "I live, yet not I, but Christ
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:41.080]   liveth in me."
[00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:45.280]   They never know what it is to say with Charles Wesley, "And can it be that I should gain
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:49.520]   an interest in the Savior's blood?"
[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:52.680]   Are you amazed at yourself?
[00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:55.880]   Do you know that God has done something in you?
[00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:58.440]   That's what makes people Christians, you know.
[00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:00.680]   Get rid of this notion of morality.
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:03.840]   There are thousands of people in this country tonight who are highly moral.
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:05.000]   You can't point a finger at them.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:11.360]   They're doing tremendous good in every direction, but it's they who are doing it all.
[00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:14.720]   And what makes a man a Christian is what God does to him.
[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:19.040]   God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness has worked the miracle, and they're
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:26.760]   marveling at it, and stand amazed and astounded before this mystery of God in Christ doing
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:27.760]   this.
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:28.760]   What is it?
[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:29.760]   Well, that brings me to my third point.
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:35.600]   It's a very great and a profound thing that God does in us.
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:41.240]   You see, the very definition of the terms conveys that notion, doesn't it?
[00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:46.320]   Think of that chaos at the beginning, when the Spirit brooded over the abyss.
[00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:52.520]   The earth was without form and void, no shape, utterly formless.
[00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:59.200]   Contrast that with creation and all the order and the design and the arrangement of creation.
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:02.560]   What a change, what a difference, what produced the difference?
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:07.680]   God's creative fiat.
[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:14.600]   And says the apostle, that's exactly what happens when a man becomes a Christian.
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:21.760]   The difference between the Christian and the non-Christian is an absolute difference.
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:25.240]   The difference between the Christian and the non-Christian is not just a matter of shading
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:26.840]   from one to another.
[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:30.240]   It isn't like the sort of thing you have in a spectrum, it isn't that at all.
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:33.360]   The difference between the Christian and the non-Christians is as different as black is
[00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:37.720]   from white.
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:42.480]   It's an essential difference.
[00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:47.440]   And this is an essential part of the definition of the Christian everywhere in the New Testament.
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:52.780]   And it follows, of course, of necessity from what we've already been saying.
[00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:56.900]   So we must get this very clearly in our minds, that no man is born a Christian and no man
[00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:58.840]   naturally takes to Christianity.
[00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:00.680]   It's the exact opposite, says Paul.
[00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:06.400]   And nothing will ever bring us into Christianity except God himself does this tremendous miracle
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:07.840]   within us.
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:15.320]   And the result of his doing so is that he produces this essential difference.
[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:16.320]   What is it?
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:20.260]   Well, let me put it like this.
[00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:24.840]   The Christian is not merely a man who's a little bit better than another man.
[00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:29.860]   He isn't a man who's just a little bit different from another man.
[00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:34.000]   What makes a man a Christian is not that he modifies the other men at certain points or
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.640]   adds a kind of appendix to the book of life, which is the same as everybody else's, in
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:40.000]   which he says that incidentally he is a Christian.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.280]   That's not Christianity at all.
[00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:52.280]   It is the profoundest change that can ever take place or can ever be known.
[00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:57.840]   You see, the terms that are used by the New Testament to describe Christianity are always
[00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:59.480]   these profound terms.
[00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:04.960]   Here it is a creation, a new creation.
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:07.800]   Paul repeats it in the next chapter in verse 17.
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:13.320]   "Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature or a new creation.
[00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:18.280]   Behold all things are passed away; behold, all things are become new."
[00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:22.640]   That's what happens when a man becomes a Christian.
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:26.160]   It is a rebirth.
[00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:35.680]   It is indeed like being born once more, starting anew, making a fresh beginning, entering into
[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:41.080]   something which is altogether different from what you had before.
[00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:44.920]   That's what it is I say by definition.
[00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:49.720]   In other words, when a man becomes a Christian, this is what takes place.
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:57.680]   Something is brought into being in that person which was not there before.
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:00.360]   That and nothing else.
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:06.080]   A new principle of life is introduced into him.
[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:09.640]   That's the meaning of these terms.
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:13.440]   That is why I am emphasizing the profound character of this change.
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:18.280]   You see, certain men decide for certain reasons to stop doing certain things that are wrong.
[00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:19.880]   We have known many instances of that.
[00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:23.960]   I have known in my own personal experience of men who had given way to drink and they
[00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:27.560]   were suffering, their professional business was suffering, and their wives and children
[00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:31.200]   were suffering, and at last something pulled them up and they saw what they were doing
[00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:35.760]   and they said, "I'll never drink another drop," and they've never done so.
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:42.160]   I've known many men of whom that's been true, but that didn't make them Christians.
[00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:45.080]   And men can decide to change their views on this or that.
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:47.320]   That doesn't make them Christians.
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:50.800]   It's much too profound for that.
[00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:55.600]   You see, this is a change which happens, as the apostle has put it there in the previous
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:32:00.920]   chapter, "written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tables
[00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:09.360]   of stone, but in the fleshy tables of the heart."
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:16.320]   So the Bible often talks about becoming Christian as a man having a new heart.
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:22.400]   And that is why David said, "Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:23.400]   within me."
[00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:25.120]   He didn't want to be improved on the surface.
[00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:30.080]   He said, "I want to be created and create within me a clean heart, O God.
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:33.760]   I don't want a bit of trimming on the surface or a little bit of varnish put on.
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:35.280]   I want a new heart.
[00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:38.440]   I've seen that my trouble's in my heart, in my center.
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:44.080]   I want a new center, so that everything that comes out of the center shall be entirely
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:48.320]   new and entirely different."
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:54.720]   And so you find everywhere in the New Testament that this is the terminology.
[00:32:54.720 --> 00:33:00.400]   The apostle Paul talks about a man being a new man in Christ Jesus.
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:04.120]   The old man, he says, has been crucified with Christ.
[00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:07.320]   I'm a new man in Christ Jesus.
[00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:09.080]   A new man.
[00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:11.000]   Now that's Christianity.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.360]   You see, it's not surprising that the world is as it is, is it?
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:18.840]   When people think that being Christian is just going to church, doing good and so on,
[00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:21.480]   no, no, it's new.
[00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:23.000]   God doing this thing.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.920]   God creating a new man, coming into being a new creature altogether.
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:30.240]   This glorious, wonderful thing.
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:36.160]   Now you understand why the apostle preached as he did.
[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:39.480]   He didn't just want people to come forward at the end to sign a card so that he could
[00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:42.120]   say, "I got so many converts when I preached at Corinth."
[00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:43.120]   That's what he was doing.
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:45.680]   He wasn't interested in that.
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:49.840]   He wanted this operation of God to be worked in their hearts.
[00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:53.320]   He wanted this miracle of the Almighty to be wrought.
[00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:54.320]   And he doesn't want to interfere.
[00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:57.280]   He doesn't want to put himself between this.
[00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:05.000]   God shining into the heart and creating a new, this new man.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.560]   Coming into being something that wasn't there before.
[00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:10.560]   A new creature.
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:11.560]   A new person.
[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:12.560]   A new beginning.
[00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:16.240]   Now that's the essence of it.
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:18.800]   And what does it all lead to?
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:25.280]   Well let me say just a word before I close as to the results of this great change.
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:30.760]   And they're all suggested here by the image which the apostle uses.
[00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:37.600]   Go back again to the beginning of Genesis and there you'll get the whole idea.
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:40.800]   The earth was without form and void.
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:41.800]   Chaos.
[00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:43.560]   No order.
[00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:44.560]   No arrangement.
[00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:45.560]   Ugly.
[00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:46.560]   The abyss.
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:47.560]   Then God began.
[00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:55.480]   And out of that he produced what is called paradise.
[00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:58.880]   That's the term that is used.
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:00.840]   Everything was absolutely perfect.
[00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:07.040]   God looked upon it all and saw that it was good.
[00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:14.200]   The trees, the grass, the flowers, the animals, different types, kinds.
[00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:21.080]   There it was in all its perfection, in all its form, and in all its balance.
[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:23.840]   Nothing is more characteristic of God's work than that always.
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:25.800]   God's work is always perfect.
[00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:29.920]   And what he made was paradise, and he made paradise out of chaos.
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:35.240]   Now you know, says Paul, this is why I'm preaching and this is why I preach as I do.
[00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:40.040]   God did that to me when he shined into my heart in the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:42.760]   And I feel that he's done to me what he did at the beginning.
[00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:47.280]   He's produced order out of the chaos.
[00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:51.920]   And I am God's handiwork.
[00:35:51.920 --> 00:36:00.040]   We are God's workmanship, created anew in Christ Jesus unto good works.
[00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:02.880]   Now I can do nothing but give you my headings this evening.
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:05.080]   I plead with you to work them out for yourself.
[00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:07.280]   It's all here in the New Testament.
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:11.560]   These are the principles.
[00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:17.720]   The first result, I say, of this great operation of God in the soul is that order is produced
[00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:19.120]   out of the chaos.
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:27.640]   I mean this, that a kind of balance is brought back into the life which had never been there
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:33.560]   before but which was in men at the beginning.
[00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:38.720]   God made men body, soul, and spirit.
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:46.160]   And man was meant to function by keeping these great powers and faculties and propensities
[00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:50.200]   in their right places and in their right proportion.
[00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:55.880]   Man had to have a body, yes, but he wasn't meant to be governed by his body.
[00:36:55.880 --> 00:37:00.360]   He was given a soul, a mind, a reason.
[00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:05.960]   And over and above that he was given a spirit which kept him in contact with God and was
[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:08.160]   the stamp, as it were, of God upon him.
[00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:11.480]   God made him in his own likeness.
[00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:19.200]   And men, because he was thus just such a great reasonable being, was made the Lord of creation.
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:23.920]   He was given the power and the ability to give names unto all the creatures.
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:28.920]   And he was meant to control them and to control the whole of nature because he had got this
[00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:31.040]   image and likeness of God upon him.
[00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:32.720]   He was not like the animals.
[00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:34.600]   The animals live according to their instincts.
[00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:36.480]   They obey their desires.
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:41.040]   The animal isn't able to think and to reason and to look at a matter objectively and to
[00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:43.280]   work it out and to apply principles.
[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:45.520]   The animal can't do that.
[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:47.560]   The animal's life is instinctual.
[00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:48.560]   It's elemental.
[00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:55.120]   Desire, impulse, reaction, that's the life of the animal.
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:59.040]   It's a very wonderful thing, but you know when you put it by the side of men, it's
[00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:00.040]   not.
[00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:03.040]   Man is altogether about this.
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:10.680]   Mind and spirit, the soul if you like, and then the body.
[00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:12.760]   And why is the world as it is tonight?
[00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:16.760]   Well, because men have lost the balance.
[00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:20.880]   The kind of life that is being lived by the majority this evening is a life that is controlled
[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:23.640]   entirely by the body.
[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:27.440]   You saw the apostle describing it, didn't you, in the second chapter of that epistle
[00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:29.080]   to the Ephesians in verse 3.
[00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:33.100]   He says, "Amongst whom we all had our conversation in times past.
[00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:35.360]   We all lived like that," he said, "in times past."
[00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:36.360]   Well, how did they live?
[00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:37.360]   And this is his answer.
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:44.640]   "We all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the
[00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:49.320]   desires of the flesh and of the mind."
[00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:51.880]   That is how we lived, says Paul.
[00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:53.600]   And he's saying the same thing here.
[00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:56.120]   It was a state of chaos.
[00:38:56.120 --> 00:39:01.800]   You see, the chaos is this, that a man was meant to be governed by his mind and understanding
[00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:07.800]   and reason, and above all by his relationship to God, is now being governed by his lusts
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:12.400]   and his desires, the desires of the flesh and the desires of the mind.
[00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:13.400]   And isn't that the truth tonight?
[00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:14.880]   What are people living for?
[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:16.280]   What determines how they live?
[00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:17.840]   Oh, it's hunger.
[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:23.440]   They must eat and thirst, drink, and get rid of these higher faculties by taking alcohol,
[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:25.680]   making a fool of yourself and a beast of yourself.
[00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:28.040]   The lusts of the body, that's how they're living.
[00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:29.040]   That's chaos.
[00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:34.520]   A man behaving like a fool.
[00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:40.120]   Man who was meant to be the Lord of creation living like the animals.
[00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:42.800]   Why does a man break his own marriage vows?
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:45.040]   Why does he break up another man's marriage?
[00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:46.040]   Tell me, why does he do it?
[00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:51.360]   Is it because he sat down and then, having read his great philosophers, worked it all
[00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:55.880]   out and decided that this was a right and a good thing to do?
[00:39:55.880 --> 00:40:00.680]   Is it the result of a rational, logical process of thought?
[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:04.080]   Well, you know perfectly well it isn't.
[00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:05.880]   Why does a man do a thing like that?
[00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:10.000]   Well, because he sees that other woman and lust arises.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.360]   Lusts, desires of the flesh and of the mind.
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:14.360]   He doesn't think.
[00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:16.200]   If he thought, he wouldn't do it.
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:19.600]   If he stopped to consider the damage he's going to do, not only to that woman, but to
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:22.200]   the husband and the little children and vice versa.
[00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:23.880]   I don't believe a man would ever do it.
[00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:24.960]   They don't stop to think.
[00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:27.280]   They behave according to their instincts.
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:28.760]   They're governed by lusts.
[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:29.760]   That's chaos.
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:30.760]   It's without form.
[00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:31.760]   It's void.
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:32.760]   It's vanity.
[00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:33.760]   It's emptiness.
[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:34.760]   It's all upside down.
[00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:35.760]   And the world is chaos.
[00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:36.760]   It's hell.
[00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:44.160]   And not only are individuals doing that, the nations are doing it.
[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:52.720]   Ah, but when a man becomes a Christian, when God says, "Let there be light," when the
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:58.760]   Almighty who created man at the beginning takes a soul and remakes it, remodels it,
[00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:02.160]   fashions it again, you know what happens?
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:04.160]   There's order again.
[00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:07.280]   The chaos is gone.
[00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:12.960]   I'm not saying that a man is perfect the moment he becomes a Christian, but I am saying this,
[00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:15.600]   that the balance is restored.
[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:16.600]   He stops.
[00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:17.600]   He begins to think.
[00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:19.760]   He's got rules, principles.
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:21.880]   The mind is restored to its position.
[00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:23.800]   The body is kept in its position.
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:28.200]   He's again mind and soul and body.
[00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:31.940]   Instead of being upside down with the body everywhere and the lusts and the passions,
[00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:38.720]   he begins to function in an orderly and in a rational manner.
[00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:39.720]   That's the first thing.
[00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:43.600]   Let me mention a second.
[00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:47.360]   It follows, of course, at once.
[00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:56.480]   The moment God restores man's mind and understanding to him, man begins to see things as they are,
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:42:00.160]   and he begins to understand them.
[00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:03.160]   You see, the mind has got to be put right, and that is what God does.
[00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:04.280]   He flashes in.
[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:09.400]   God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness has shined into our heart, which
[00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:11.400]   doesn't just mean the sensibilities.
[00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:13.800]   It means the center of the personality.
[00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:14.800]   And what does he do?
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:18.200]   Well, he gives a man an understanding.
[00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:23.240]   And the first thing, as I've already told you, is this.
[00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:28.000]   He gives him an understanding of the glory of God.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.640]   The man begins to think and says, "How could I ever have lived as I've been living?
[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:34.600]   I've been living as if I was the Lord of creation myself.
[00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:37.760]   I've been living as if I'd got an endless lease on life.
[00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:39.440]   I never thought about my soul.
[00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:40.640]   I never thought about death.
[00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:42.000]   I never thought about God.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.200]   I never thought about facing God in the judgment.
[00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:45.480]   I see I've been a fool."
[00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:47.080]   He stops and thinks.
[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:50.960]   He says, "Who am I and what am I?"
[00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:58.280]   And he realizes that God is there over all, the glory of God.
[00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:01.960]   And then, you see, he begins to see himself as he is.
[00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:04.360]   He no longer defends himself.
[00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:06.360]   He is no longer self-righteous.
[00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:09.720]   He no longer says, "Yes, I admit I've done certain things, but look at the good I do."
[00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:13.240]   He doesn't keep these ledgers, balancing the account, good against bad, and everything
[00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:14.240]   all right at the end.
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:15.240]   No, no.
[00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:16.240]   He says, "I'm vile.
[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:17.240]   I'm lost.
[00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:19.040]   In me, that is to say, in my flesh dwelleth no good thing."
[00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:20.040]   He stops arguing.
[00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:21.040]   He gives up.
[00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:22.920]   He says, "I'm utterly vile before God.
[00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:23.920]   I haven't thanked Him.
[00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:24.920]   I haven't praised Him.
[00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:25.920]   I haven't lived to His glory.
[00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:28.200]   Oh, how is it that I'm still alive?
[00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:31.520]   How is it that God hasn't blotted me out of existence long since?"
[00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:33.080]   He falls before God.
[00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:41.000]   He is in utter helplessness and shame, in an agony of soul, and cries out for mercy.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.200]   It always happens.
[00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:49.600]   No man can be a Christian without knowing repentance, and that is repentance.
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:55.520]   A man seeing his own folly, his own blindness, his own vileness, and acknowledging it before
[00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:59.080]   God and pleading nothing for himself at all.
[00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:03.520]   He admits that in him, that is to say, in his flesh dwelleth no good thing at all.
[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:04.520]   That he's altogether rotten.
[00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:14.040]   "Behold, I was born in sins," says David, "and shapen in iniquity.
[00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:18.080]   There is no health in us, none at all."
[00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:22.800]   Well, he begins to understand this.
[00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:30.360]   And then you see he is given an understanding of this blessed, glorious gospel.
[00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:33.440]   This man can now see very plainly that he can never save himself.
[00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:37.840]   It doesn't matter what he does, he'll never make himself a Christian.
[00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:41.840]   "Could my tears forever flow?
[00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:45.880]   Could my zeal now rest but no?
[00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:50.080]   All for sin could not atone.
[00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:55.160]   Thou must save, and thou alone.
[00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:59.960]   Nothing in my hands I bring, simply to thy cross I cling.
[00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:04.640]   Helpless, come to thee for grace.
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:07.840]   Naked, come to thee for dress.
[00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:10.600]   Helpless, look to thee for grace.
[00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:14.600]   Foul, I to the fountain fly.
[00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:17.160]   Wash me, Savior, or I die."
[00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:18.280]   That's what he says.
[00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:19.280]   He understands it.
[00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:22.440]   He's in no difficulty about understanding the gospel.
[00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:24.600]   He doesn't want to argue about the atonement.
[00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:27.120]   He says, "If Christ hasn't died for me, I'm done for.
[00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:28.120]   I'm lost.
[00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:30.000]   It's the only way."
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.240]   He sees it all.
[00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:33.480]   His mind has been enlightened.
[00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:38.360]   And not only that, he begins to understand the whole purpose of life.
[00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:41.840]   He doesn't any longer live for this life and this world.
[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:47.240]   He sees it's only a passing life, a kind of preparatory school, a kind of preparation
[00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:50.000]   for the great life which is to come.
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:53.680]   And then at the back of it all he sees God's great plan of salvation.
[00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:56.560]   He begins to understand the Old Testament and the New.
[00:45:56.560 --> 00:46:01.400]   He sees how God was preparing for the coming of His Son, how the Son came, what He did,
[00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:02.720]   and what is going to happen.
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:07.560]   He sees Christ seated at the right hand of God in glory, simply waiting until His enemies
[00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:09.640]   shall be made His footstool.
[00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:12.760]   This man is not at all appalled by modern history.
[00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:15.440]   He's not surprised that the world is as it is tonight.
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:19.760]   He's not surprised that the crisis in Czechoslovakia, the crisis in tomorrow's conference, he's
[00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:24.640]   not a bit surprised that what may happen in the next United Nations organization meeting,
[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:26.200]   he expects all this.
[00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:27.840]   Man in sin is a fool.
[00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:28.840]   He doesn't think.
[00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:29.840]   He's governed by lust.
[00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:30.840]   He's bound to quarrel.
[00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:32.040]   There will be wars.
[00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:33.520]   He understands it all.
[00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:34.520]   He's not alarmed.
[00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:35.920]   He's not frightened.
[00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:37.200]   But he's not hopeless.
[00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:43.680]   And for this reason, not that he has his faith in politicians or in anybody else, but that
[00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:50.440]   he now does see that God has got a plan for the ages, and that the Son of God who came
[00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:56.560]   first as a babe in Bethlehem will come again as the King of kings and the Lord of lords,
[00:46:56.560 --> 00:47:01.040]   riding the clouds of heaven, and will usher in His everlasting kingdom.
[00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:04.160]   Evil and sin are going to be destroyed.
[00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:07.280]   You know, there is a day coming when war shall be no more.
[00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:10.280]   Ah, yes, but Christ will have come back before them.
[00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:13.440]   Yes, by then the elements will have melted with the fervent heat.
[00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:18.840]   And there will be a new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness by then.
[00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:20.080]   But it's coming.
[00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:21.360]   And this man sees it.
[00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:22.920]   He understands it.
[00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:25.600]   His new life enables him to see.
[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:28.840]   His mind is open to the truth of God.
[00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:32.400]   And he's rejoicing in it.
[00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:42.040]   He is able to say with the Apostle Paul, "We have the mind of Christ."
[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:43.040]   What a say!
[00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:44.040]   But we have it.
[00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:45.040]   The mind of Christ.
[00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:46.040]   God has given it to us.
[00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:47.040]   It's in us.
[00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:52.000]   A new understanding, opening out all this glory before us.
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.640]   Then another thing I must just give you my heading is this.
[00:47:54.640 --> 00:48:00.560]   As the result of this new creative act of God, a man finds now that he has the possibility
[00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:06.360]   again of functioning truly as he was meant to function.
[00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:09.920]   How was man meant to function?
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:15.560]   Well, he was meant to function as a child of God.
[00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:18.880]   God said, "Let us make men in our own image."
[00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:20.440]   He stamped his image upon him.
[00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:23.440]   He gave him original righteousness.
[00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:26.640]   Man was meant to live to the glory of God.
[00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:30.320]   He was meant to be a kind of reflection of God.
[00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:37.680]   He was meant to live a life of communion and of fellowship with God, eschewing evil, choosing
[00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:42.240]   righteousness.
[00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:46.280]   But no man as he is by nature can do that.
[00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:50.720]   There is none righteous, no, not one.
[00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:54.000]   Nobody has ever kept the Ten Commandments.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.160]   Nobody has ever lived the moral law.
[00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:58.840]   All the codes are beyond us.
[00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:04.920]   Even the codes of the pagan philosophers are beyond us, and their demands elude us.
[00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:07.920]   We cannot get there.
[00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:12.920]   And yet I say that when God makes a man anew, he gives him the possibility of living a life
[00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:15.760]   of righteousness and of holiness.
[00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:20.520]   The kingdom of God, says the apostle Paul, is not meat and drink, but righteousness and
[00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:23.040]   peace and joy in the Holy Ghost.
[00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:29.960]   Or take it again in Ephesians 2.10, "We are his workmanship, created anew in Christ Jesus."
[00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:30.960]   What for?
[00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:39.360]   "Unto good works that God hath before ordained that we should walk in them."
[00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:43.320]   We are created anew, that we may live this new life.
[00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:44.320]   How is it possible?
[00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:49.080]   It is only possible in this way, that God has put a new principle of life in me, that
[00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:55.120]   I now want to live this life I did not before, but I now hunger and thirst after righteousness.
[00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:56.840]   I love the law of God.
[00:49:56.840 --> 00:49:59.280]   His commandments are no longer grievous.
[00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:00.280]   I am a new man.
[00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:01.280]   I have a new nature.
[00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:02.280]   I have got new desires.
[00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:09.520]   I am now more anxious to live a holy life than I ever was to live the life of sin.
[00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:16.080]   And God has put his Holy Spirit within us to give us strength and power.
[00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:21.360]   Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God that worketh in you
[00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:23.120]   both to will and to do.
[00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:24.600]   You are not left to yourself.
[00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:28.600]   You are not simply left in your weakness and failure and asked to live this impossible
[00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:29.600]   sermon on the mount.
[00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:30.600]   No, no, no.
[00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:36.880]   God worketh in us, energizes us, puts his dynamic into us, both to will and to do of
[00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:38.200]   his good pleasure.
[00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:42.000]   I am able to function as man was meant to function.
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:46.880]   This is something of the blessing of this new creation, this new life which is lived
[00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:48.560]   by the new man.
[00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:52.720]   And for me to finish, the thing that the apostle has said in the last verse of the previous
[00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:54.520]   chapter becomes true.
[00:50:54.520 --> 00:51:00.880]   We all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the
[00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:11.160]   same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.
[00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:12.160]   What does it mean?
[00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:17.080]   Oh, this is a marvelous thing, this.
[00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:25.280]   It means, you see, that God who, looking into the chaos of your life and mine, seeing it
[00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:32.920]   all without form and void, said, "Let there be life," fasting the knowledge in the face
[00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:38.040]   of Jesus Christ, putting the new principle of life, the new potentialities.
[00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:42.520]   Ah, but he hasn't left it at that.
[00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:45.560]   You see, it wasn't enough that God should just say, "Let there be light."
[00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:46.560]   That was the beginning.
[00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:49.240]   And then you go on, the days of creation.
[00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:51.360]   God did this and formed that.
[00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:54.000]   On he went with it until it was absolutely perfect.
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.520]   He looked on and saw that it was all good.
[00:51:56.520 --> 00:52:02.460]   And the parallel is carried out right through.
[00:52:02.460 --> 00:52:04.520]   It starts in that new birth.
[00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:07.160]   It doesn't end there.
[00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:13.480]   He goes on working in us, being persuaded of this, says the apostle Paul, that he which
[00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:20.400]   hath begun a good work in us will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ.
[00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:21.400]   He's going on with it.
[00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:22.880]   What's this life to a Christian?
[00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:24.280]   I'll tell you what it is.
[00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:28.760]   He's only being prepared for glory.
[00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:35.080]   This is the preparation for the glory which is to come.
[00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:42.880]   We all, beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are chained into the same image
[00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:51.760]   from glory to glory as by the Spirit of the Lord, going on developing day by day as our
[00:52:51.760 --> 00:53:01.320]   inputs change from glory into glory, till in heaven we take our place, till we cast
[00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:11.520]   our crowns before him, lost in wonder, love, and praise.
[00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:13.560]   That's Christianity.
[00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:20.360]   God making us anew for himself, fashioning us after the image of Christ, perfecting us,
[00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:34.080]   going on with it day by day from glory to glory until, O blessed morn, we shall stand
[00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:46.280]   before him and look into his face and see him as he is, yes, but most marvelous of all,
[00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:57.080]   and be like him, glorious as he himself is glorious.
[00:53:57.080 --> 00:53:59.920]   That's Christianity.
[00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:07.640]   And on that morning the writer of the hymn tells us we shall be lost in wonder, the wonder
[00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:19.080]   that I, feeble, fallible, sinful, vile, selfish, such as I am by nature, should be with him
[00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:23.000]   in the glory and should be like him.
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:25.440]   Nothing but a miracle could bring that to pass.
[00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:28.600]   That's exactly what happens when every man becomes a Christian.
[00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:38.280]   God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness has shined into our hearts to give
[00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:45.400]   the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:46.400]   Has he done it to you?
[00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:48.920]   If he hasn't, you're not a Christian.
[00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:50.320]   I don't care how good you are.
[00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:51.760]   I don't care how moral you are.
[00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:53.760]   I don't care how prominent in your church you are.
[00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:58.000]   I don't care how much good you do in your church, how much you work in your church.
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:04.280]   If you cannot say that the Almighty God has worked in you and put new life into you and
[00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:10.720]   made a new creature of you, you are not a Christian.
[00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:17.800]   And if you die in that condition, you'll go to hell because you belong to that realm.
[00:55:17.800 --> 00:55:20.520]   Has he done it?
[00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:24.520]   Are you amazed at yourself?
[00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:27.440]   Is the life of God in you a soul?
[00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:30.920]   Are you being changed from glory into glory?
[00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:36.480]   Have you seen this great light that changes everything?
[00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:41.040]   If you have, God bless you because he'll go on changing you until you're absolutely
[00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:44.480]   perfect and conformed to the image of his dear Son.
[00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:47.960]   If not, my dear friend, don't waste a second.
[00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:48.960]   Confess it to God.
[00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:51.840]   Tell him that he hasn't done it.
[00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:55.880]   Ask him to do it.
[00:55:55.880 --> 00:55:59.400]   Tell him now that if that is Christianity, that you've never been a Christian at all
[00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:02.600]   but that you'd like to be a Christian.
[00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:06.880]   Cry out for mercy and for compassion.
[00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:13.200]   Ask him by his Spirit to work the miracle in you so that you'll know what it is to
[00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:17.680]   be lost in wonder, love and praise as you look at yourself and see what God has made
[00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:20.440]   of you and not you yourself.
[00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:22.720]   Make no tarrying.
[00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:28.560]   If you see that you are yourself still and haven't received this life divine, cry out
[00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:31.880]   for it.
[00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:38.240]   Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.
[00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:40.200]   Plead with him.
[00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:43.960]   Say to him quietly, "Breathe on me breath of God.
[00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:52.280]   Fill me with life anew that I may love what thou dost love and do what thou wouldst do
[00:56:52.280 --> 00:56:58.160]   and go on praying because if you do, I assure you, he will hear you, he will answer you
[00:56:58.160 --> 00:57:06.520]   and he will work the miracle in you and you'll become a new creature, a new creation, a new
[00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:11.320]   man in Christ Jesus.
[00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:13.760]   Amen.
[00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:17.680]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
