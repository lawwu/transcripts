[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.560]   Feminism is the theory that women should be the political, social, economic, cultural equals of men.
[00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.920]   I say that this is a terrible definition, which just violates normal usage. Why?
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:17.200]   Well, we actually have public opinion data on, first of all, whether people are or are not feminists,
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.520]   and second of all, what they believe about the political, social, economic, cultural equality of women,
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:29.120]   and guess what? A overwhelming majority of people that say they are not feminists
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:35.240]   still agree with the equality of women on all those mentions, which makes you realize,
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:41.040]   "Well, that really can't be the definition of feminism. That would be like saying feminism is the theory that the sky is blue."
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.920]   Well, feminists do believe the sky is blue, but that isn't what distinguishes feminists from other people.
