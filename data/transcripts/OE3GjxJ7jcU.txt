[00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.000]   female employees because they're so worried.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.800]   And then I go and track down a bunch of feminist reaction to this where they basically just
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.980]   say, "I can't believe how horrible these guys are."
[00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.220]   It's like, look, you're asking them for a favor to get mentorship.
[00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.220]   They're scared.
[00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.860]   If someone's scared, do you really want to yell at them more and offer more mostly empty
