[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.360]   And so I had this idea, why don't we go back and look at what work meant for our ancestors?
[00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:14.300]   So for that first 300,000 years before modernity as we know it emerged, because 300,000 years
[00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:19.440]   is a long enough period of time that we can assume there's some sort of adaptation going
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.440]   on.
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:27.240]   The ways that we approach "work" during the Paleolithic were ways that we can argue that
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:36.360]   maybe we have some inclination towards as a species.
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:44.960]   I'm Cal Newport and this is Deep Questions, episode 222.
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:52.280]   I'm here in my Deep Work HQ joined as always by my producer, Jesse.
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:58.800]   Jesse, we got a big variety pack of a show today in terms of a diversity of different
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.720]   types of clips and segments and questions we have coming up.
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.040]   I'm pretty excited about it actually.
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.040]   Yeah, it's cool.
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.400]   It's always good to have different topics.
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.120]   There's a deep dive.
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.720]   So I have a new New Yorker piece out.
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.040]   So I like to take some time to talk about those.
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.640]   We have a live call.
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.800]   People enjoyed when we did our first live call a couple of weekends ago.
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.320]   So you get to hear me interact back and forth with a listener.
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.400]   We have our standard questions and we have a news reaction segment coming up later.
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:36.160]   There's some new information and case studies out in the world of kids and phones, which
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.560]   I thought was interesting and even a little bit optimistic.
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.560]   So we have that all coming up.
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.020]   So a lot of different type of segments all combined into the same episode.
[00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:51.200]   So I think we should just get rolling and start as I like to with a deep dive.
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:02:00.000]   The title I want to use for today's deep dive is the question, did cavemen use to do list?
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.080]   I know caveman is an out of date term, but I like the way it sounds a little pithy title.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.720]   So we'll be a little anachronistic there.
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.480]   This deep dive is about an article that I recently published in the New Yorker.
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.240]   I will put on the screen now for those who are watching the episode at youtube.com/town
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.400]   Newport media at the very least.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.720]   So we can feature this really cool graphic that Callum Heath put together for the article.
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.560]   They sent me a black and white draft of this when he was still working on.
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.040]   I think it's cool for those who are listening.
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:36.480]   It was, it's a graphic where two knowledge workers have tipped the desk over and one
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.880]   of them is holding a spear and they're looking over the desk into a paleolithic Savannah
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.160]   type situation with some gear out there and it's all digitized.
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.520]   It's a cool piece of artwork.
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.480]   So here's the official title of this latest article.
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:56.120]   What hunter gatherers can teach us about the frustrations of modern work.
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.240]   And the pub date on this is November 2nd.
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.760]   So it just came out somewhat recently.
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.280]   This is a bit of a beast of an article.
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.600]   I think it weighs in at 5,000 words and I'll talk a little bit about this in a second.
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.640]   It wasn't the easiest article to figure out how to structure, but once I did, I think
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.640]   it made sense.
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.000]   I want to hone in on this deep dive though at the heart of it.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.880]   So the, the premise, the motivating premise here was a thought experiment and it went
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.040]   something like this.
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:32.040]   Humans existed in a hunter gatherer style scenario for about 300,000 years until we
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.160]   get to the Neolithic revolution, which brings in agriculture and animal husbandry.
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.880]   And from there we get surplus of crops.
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.120]   We get surplus income.
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.600]   We get capital growth, the cities, the modern civilization, everything comes out of that.
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.600]   That's 15,000 years.
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.280]   Like that's a very recent piece of our history.
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:59.520]   And so I had this idea, why don't we go back and look at what work meant for our ancestors.
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:05.480]   So for that first 300,000 years before modernity as we know it emerged, because 300,000 years
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.640]   is a long enough period of time that we can assume there's some sort of adaptation going
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.640]   on.
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:17.520]   The ways that we approached quote unquote work during the Paleolithic were ways that
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:21.680]   we can argue that maybe we have some inclination towards as a species.
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.060]   And so my idea was let's understand a deep history of work, what work meant for most
[00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:32.160]   of our species history, then compare that to in particular knowledge work today.
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.280]   That is the subclass of the working population that sits at computer screens most of the
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.360]   day.
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.200]   And where we find big differences between how we were adapted to work and how we're
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:48.640]   working today might be places where we find sources of frustration or stress.
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.400]   That when we find ways where our current work is really out of sync with what we did for
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.760]   most of our species histories, this might be a great way of identifying pain points,
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.320]   places where we're generating friction with our fundamental nature.
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.920]   So in other words, this is a high concept premise.
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:12.000]   From the deep history of work, we might get some reform ideas for the way we work today.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.320]   So that was the premise.
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:15.440]   So how do we figure this out?
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.440]   All right.
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:21.840]   So how do we figure out what work was through most of our species history?
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:27.400]   And here I make the argument in the piece starting with the work of Richard Lee in the
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.760]   1960s, "Journeying to the Dobie Region of the Northwest Kalahari Desert."
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:38.680]   I introduced this notion that starting with that pioneering work in the 1960s, anthropology
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:46.800]   has learned a lot from extant hunter-gatherer groups, especially in the early, mid 20th
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.680]   century, before most of these disappeared.
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:56.280]   With care, they were able to learn about the functioning of a hunter-gatherer socioeconomic
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:01.440]   group from extant tribes, anthropological study of extant tribes, and from that gain
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:07.520]   some insight into what life might've been like from a work perspective in the early
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.920]   history of our species.
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.800]   And so a whole lot of the beginning of this article is just getting into this movement
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.240]   within anthropology and establishing that this is something that they figured out how
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.400]   to do in anthropology.
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.720]   I want all of this to be taken with a big grain of salt.
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.720]   This is more thought experiment than rigorous science.
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:30.480]   All of the anthropologists I talked to or read are very careful about, you're not seeing,
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:35.320]   for example, lost tribes from a Paleolithic past.
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:40.480]   Modern hunter-gatherer tribes, or not tribes, communities, the word tribe is not used, communities
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:41.480]   are their own thing.
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.480]   They're modern.
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.680]   They have their own interactions with the world.
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.300]   This is not observing a time capsule of time past.
[00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:54.100]   But what you can figure out, this is what anthropology has uncovered, what you can figure
[00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:59.640]   out by looking at extant tribes is just getting down to the economy of how hunting-gathering
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:00.640]   works.
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:01.640]   What's the effort involved?
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.560]   How does it break down socially?
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:08.280]   What is life like where you have to gather your calories not through agriculture but
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.440]   through going out and hunting and/or gathering?
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.760]   So there's some care to be taken here.
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.680]   But I thought it would be fun to do.
[00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:17.680]   And so I got into this.
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:22.420]   I read a bunch of books, read a bunch of papers, talked to a bunch of people, and I ended up
[00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:29.520]   identifying three things to focus on, three places where the way we work today is quite
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:34.640]   different than the way we used to work throughout most of our species history.
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.560]   All right, so let's scroll down.
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:41.920]   As you can see, if you're watching on the YouTube, it takes a lot of words to get to
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:42.920]   where we are now.
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:46.560]   All right, so here are the three observations I made.
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:52.620]   So the first has to do with what's known as the immediate return economy.
[00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:58.760]   This is drawing from the work of an anthropologist named James Woodburn.
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:06.060]   And this is this notion that in most hunter-gatherer context, the reward for a food-gathering effort
[00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:07.860]   was immediate.
[00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:13.260]   So the quote here, "People obtain a direct and immediate return from their labor.
[00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:17.320]   They go out hunting or gathering and eat food obtained the same day or casually over the
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.060]   days that follow."
[00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:23.320]   There are some argument, if you look at the planning centers of our brain, we can see
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:28.600]   that reflected in the way that our planning action reward loops function in our brain.
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.720]   Here's what we're going to do.
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:30.720]   Let's make a plan.
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.180]   Let's execute the plan.
[00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:34.380]   We get reward from that plan.
[00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:35.960]   We update the state of our brain.
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.160]   We move on to what's next.
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:41.280]   So our brain likely fits this pattern of, let's go do this.
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:42.440]   We're done with this.
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:43.440]   Here's the reward.
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:50.480]   That, of course, is quite different than the way work unfolds in modern knowledge work.
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:57.040]   As I point out here, in office life, our efforts rarely generate an immediate reward.
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:02.440]   When we answer an email or attend a meeting, we're typically advancing in fits and starts,
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:05.800]   long-term projects that may be weeks or months away from completion.
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:09.400]   The modern knowledge worker also tends to juggle many different objectives at the same
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:13.560]   time, moving rapidly back and forth between them throughout the day.
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:19.840]   This idea of, I have nine or 10 ongoing conversations in my hyperactive hive mind inbox, servicing
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:25.880]   seven or eight ongoing projects, is really out of sync with the immediate return economies
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:30.880]   of most of our past, where it was, we need some food.
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.960]   All I'm doing now is hunting or gathering.
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.600]   Now I'm done with that activity.
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:35.600]   Here's the reward.
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.800]   Here is the food.
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:40.680]   Doing many different things at the same time, constantly switching back and forth without
[00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:43.760]   immediate rewards, like we do in knowledge work.
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:52.600]   That is out of sync with the planning action reward loops that most of our species history
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:53.600]   we were using.
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:59.600]   All right, let's look at the next point out of the three.
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:04.760]   Right here, another place where work and hunter-gatherer societies differs from our modern efforts
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:11.280]   is the degree to which the intensity of our work varies over time.
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:17.880]   So here I'm quoting Mark Dybul from University College London, who did a study in 2019.
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:21.640]   They went to spend time among the Ajta people of the Northern Philippines.
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:28.240]   It's an interesting community because it split at some point in the relatively recent past.
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:31.060]   Some of this community is rice farming.
[00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:34.120]   Some of this community persist with hunting and gathering.
[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:40.280]   So you can do this apples to apples comparison, the same people in the same environment with
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.360]   the same culture.
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:45.960]   And so they're really good target for studying how much work is required, for example, how
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:51.780]   much effort is required in hunting, gathering versus farming, because all these other variables
[00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:52.780]   are head constant.
[00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:56.680]   So that's why Mark Dybul and his team went out there.
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:11:01.080]   But one of the things he pointed out in his paper and confirmed to me or elaborated to
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:07.680]   me when we talked is that the amount of time the hunter and gatherer spent versus their
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:11.720]   rice farming brethren is not the full story.
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:17.040]   What also matters is how work and leisure was distributed throughout the day.
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:22.440]   And so the farmers, he pointed out, engaged, and I'm quoting him here, in monotonous, continuous
[00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:23.800]   work.
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:30.160]   The foragers, by contrast, had many more breaks interspersed throughout their daily efforts.
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:35.960]   Dybul talked about spending time with a group that was fishing from among the forager group.
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:40.280]   And he said, there's long breaks, you know, the fish aren't biting, let's take a nap.
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:42.120]   Okay, now we're going to fish some more.
[00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.680]   Now we're resting, hunting excursions.
[00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:47.760]   It's not like you were hunting all day, they would go into the forest at the heat of the
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:51.160]   day, you might just rest, maybe you weren't finding a good trail.
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:56.880]   So he really emphasized with the hunting gatherer group, intensity was up and down, intense
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:00.260]   periods, non intense periods.
[00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:04.680]   If we compare this to modern knowledge worker, we of course find something very different.
[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:09.080]   Modern knowledge workers, and I'll quote myself here, adopt the factory model in which you
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:13.760]   work for set hours each day at a continually high level of intensity without significant
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:14.760]   breaks.
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:17.440]   So we are used to this idea that we have work hours.
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.060]   During work hours, we're always going.
[00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:23.560]   If there's not a meeting to attend, there's an email to answer or a task that we're behind
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:24.620]   on.
[00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:31.120]   So like the rice farmers from that study, we're constantly working all day long at an
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:35.600]   intensity level that's that's remained consistently high.
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:39.880]   Our ancestors for 300,000 years had intensity levels go up and down, up and down.
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:47.000]   My final point of difference, concerns, I'll quote myself here, the nature of work, of
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.280]   the work occupying our time then and now.
[00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:55.520]   So I go into a lot of detail here about how skilled hunting and foraging activities were
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:13:03.800]   and how much training would go into mastering the art of, let's say, hunting big game, or
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:09.840]   the knowledge you would have to have a horticulture in your area to successfully gather enough
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:12.600]   calories to be useful for the effort.
[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:19.240]   And so a lot of the activity, the work activity in our past would have been highly skilled.
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.280]   We'd be used to that.
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:24.920]   This is something hard, and I did it, and I can feel proud about it.
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:30.800]   And I pointed out in modern knowledge work, though modern knowledge work is skilled in
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:34.480]   the sense that it requires high levels of education and skill, we are, and I'm quoting
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:41.560]   myself here, increasingly drowned the application of such talents in a deluge of distraction.
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:45.160]   So though we maybe have all these skills we were trained with, more and more of our day
[00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:50.000]   is doing, let's say, communication, it's in meetings, it's sending emails back and forth,
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.280]   ad hoc messaging, administrative work for other units within our organization.
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:58.120]   And when we do get a chance to try to do something skilled, we're going to try to write that
[00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:00.580]   code or put together the strategy memo.
[00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:05.240]   We can't enjoy the feeling of pure application of skill like we would have in our past because
[00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:09.000]   we also have to interrupt that once every six minutes to send a message over here or
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.720]   to join into a Slack message over there.
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:12.480]   So I said, this is a big point of difference.
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:17.280]   We were used to back then, I'm going to go start a fire and it's wet and I'm just use
[00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:22.400]   a string bow and I just really know the materials in the woods and how to make this work.
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:25.260]   And it's this hard thing and there's a satisfaction of completion.
[00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:29.080]   We just don't have that nearly as much anymore in our modern work.
[00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:34.960]   All right, so we can summarize those three points.
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:40.120]   We can say, what's the difference?
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:44.960]   We do more stuff now, so we're working more, we have more stuff on our plate than we did
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:46.820]   in our ancestral past.
[00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:50.600]   We work at a continually high pace as opposed to a very natural pace like we did in our
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:52.280]   past.
[00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:58.540]   And we don't prioritize skill or quality or producing really hard things at the height
[00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:01.440]   of our skill today in the way that a lot of the efforts we would have done in our past
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:07.860]   would have been much more intense application of well honed skills.
[00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:13.160]   And so if we want to make our work today closer to what it was there, and that's a really
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.820]   fraught statement, so let's put a pin in that for now.
[00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:20.540]   You could summarize that as we should work less at a natural pace while obsessing more
[00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:22.960]   over the quality of what we produce.
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:26.880]   And so the goal here in this argument is not that we want to be like our Paleolithic ancestors.
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:30.980]   This is not like paleo productivity, though I do think that's a catchphrase you could
[00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:32.720]   probably sell a lot of books with.
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:37.360]   What it is instead is about being careful about how we shape our modern world that we
[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:43.280]   don't have direct friction or points of conflict with our fundamental adaptation.
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:48.680]   So for example, you don't have to try to eat exactly like we would have eaten 300,000 years
[00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:54.400]   ago to recognize that our body is not used to or adapted to tons of refined sugar.
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:56.560]   So maybe I shouldn't eat tons of refined sugar.
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:16:00.320]   We don't need to go obsess about exactly what nuts our Paleolithic ancestors would have
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:05.380]   eaten or eat meat raw or something like this, but maybe not eat a lot of sugar.
[00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:06.380]   That makes a lot of sense.
[00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:07.560]   Well, it's something similar here.
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:11.880]   If we can find big points of conflict between what work was and what it is today, it's not
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:16.120]   that we're going to go dress in furs and work in caves, but we can try to excise from our
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:21.120]   modern work particular properties or attributes that are in conflict with our fundamental
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:22.360]   adaptation.
[00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:26.320]   And so in the piece, I do get into like what those adaptations might look like.
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:31.120]   Shifting, for example, here's examples from the article, shifting towards pole systems
[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:34.760]   of task allocation, where you work on one thing at a time.
[00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:38.540]   And then when you're done, you pull a new thing in to work on.
[00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:41.060]   Cavemen didn't have pole systems, right?
[00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:46.220]   But that would be a approach to workload that is much more compatible with our wiring because
[00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:49.060]   in our past, we typically did one thing at a time.
[00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:51.040]   We didn't have 30 things ongoing.
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:55.620]   So offloading all of this concurrent work to an external system and having individuals
[00:16:55.620 --> 00:17:01.000]   work on one thing at a time is a thoroughly modern way of working, but it is attuned to
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.980]   our thoroughly old wiring as humans.
[00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:07.700]   What about working at a more natural pace?
[00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:12.180]   Well, that would require breaking free of the factory surveillance model of here is
[00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:15.180]   your hours to work during those hours you need to be working.
[00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:19.700]   We will be surveilling you either in person, are you at your desk or digitally?
[00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:20.700]   Are you answering my emails?
[00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:24.500]   Are you answering slacks to make sure that you're not slacking off?
[00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:28.540]   We would have to move away from that model to get to something that's more natural and
[00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:30.140]   varied.
[00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:34.120]   There are people and places that do this in modern knowledge work.
[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:38.660]   In this article, I point to an article I wrote last year for the New Yorker about results
[00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:41.300]   only work environments.
[00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:46.540]   It's a work philosophy where you're only evaluated on what you produce.
[00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:49.700]   There are no expectations about when and where you work.
[00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:54.660]   In fact, it's encouraged for you to be self-optimizing in that way.
[00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:59.100]   Maybe the afternoons you're off doing soccer games with your kids and it's Sunday mornings
[00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:02.660]   you like to work whatever, it doesn't matter about it.
[00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:04.020]   These type of philosophies exist.
[00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:08.100]   I think one of the reasons why they're successful where they're applied is because it allows
[00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:09.840]   the pace your work to be more natural.
[00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:11.180]   Some days more intense than others.
[00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:14.780]   Some part of the days you're going hard, some days you're taking off the afternoon because
[00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:17.240]   the focus is on the results that's allowed.
[00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:19.580]   That puts us more in tune with our ancient wiring.
[00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:24.260]   I mean, again, it's not let's have a schedule like a caveman.
[00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:27.740]   Let's have a thoroughly modern approach to work that doesn't directly conflict with the
[00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:30.660]   way that we're wired.
[00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:31.660]   What about the skill?
[00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:36.660]   Well, this comes down to, again, the constant distraction.
[00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:41.580]   So when we move towards a notion of work like the types of notions I write about in a world
[00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:45.460]   without email where we have structure around communication and collaboration, it's not
[00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:50.020]   ad hoc back and forth messaging, thereby freeing up long periods of time where you can actually
[00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:54.240]   focus at the thing in front of you without having to tend to ongoing conversations.
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:19:00.500]   These type of changes take modern work and make it, again, much more compatible with
[00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:03.860]   our brain because now it's I'm doing this hard thing till I'm done and I can get that
[00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:05.740]   satisfaction.
[00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:08.380]   All these type of changes, of course, are hard.
[00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:10.860]   Switching to a poll system, that's a big deal.
[00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:13.780]   That feels eccentric in most contexts, but I think it's a good idea.
[00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:18.460]   As I documented, results only work environments are difficult to get right.
[00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:24.200]   They take a huge amount of training and buy in from people at the top.
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:27.280]   And as I write about in a world without email, moving away from the hyperactive hive mind
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:29.940]   is no easy task.
[00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:31.480]   It's a convenient way to collaborate.
[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:33.920]   To replace it with alternatives is a pain.
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:42.920]   So this article is meant to maybe give us one more point of motivation for actually
[00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:45.240]   making these type of hard changes.
[00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:50.080]   So I'll leave you with the way I end this article.
[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:54.160]   So I say we're built to work, but not this way.
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:59.480]   In the conclusion of his paper and his time spent among the Johansi, Lee argued that through
[00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:02.960]   most of our species histories and most of the environments in which we have lived, hunting
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:06.260]   and gathering was a well-adapted way of life.
[00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:09.900]   Perhaps the time has come to demand something similar from the types of work that take up
[00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:11.200]   so much of our time today.
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:14.200]   So there we go, Jesse.
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:17.960]   5,000 words of lots of stuff.
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:18.960]   Yeah.
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:19.960]   Cool image.
[00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:20.960]   Yeah.
[00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:21.960]   And that cool picture.
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:22.960]   Yeah.
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:23.960]   Yeah.
[00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:26.120]   So you don't go on social media.
[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:30.360]   When you're in deep work sessions, do you get the urge to check your texts or check
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:31.360]   email?
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:32.360]   Yeah.
[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:33.360]   So you get that?
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:34.360]   Yeah.
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:35.360]   Do you get it a lot?
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:36.360]   Yeah.
[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:41.280]   Well, it's typically at the beginning of the sessions versus like once you get going, it's
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:42.280]   okay.
[00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:46.240]   I think it's the same as resistance to going to the gym or exercising, right?
[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:52.520]   Our brain, rightly so, is a jealous protector of energy.
[00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:55.160]   We got to be careful about our calories and how we expend it.
[00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:58.700]   So why do we feel procrastination about going to the gym or exercising?
[00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:02.680]   It's often because our brain is thinking, what are we going to do?
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:05.720]   We're going to go over here and like move these heavy things and burn all these calories
[00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:06.720]   for no reason.
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:07.720]   Like we're not building something.
[00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:08.720]   We're not hunting something.
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:09.720]   Nothing.
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:12.720]   We're not trying to have a tangible outcome and we have to overcome that natural instinct.
[00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:15.440]   And then once we get going and exercising, we feel good about it.
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:16.440]   Deep work is the same way.
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:21.680]   Our brain's like, I don't want to expend all of these calories cogitating.
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.800]   Like what are we thinking about here?
[00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:26.560]   Like we're not figuring out a plan to get away from the tiger.
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:29.440]   So I think we feel a real resistance to deep work.
[00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:35.360]   And that's why my arguments for what you do to be better at deep work sessions is you
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:37.600]   have to have a steadfast rule.
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:39.040]   There's just no context switching.
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:42.200]   If you want a context switch, you want to look at email, you want to look at text.
[00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:43.280]   It's not deep work.
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:45.600]   So do something else or don't pretend like you are.
[00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:46.600]   Don't even have exceptions.
[00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:49.000]   Like that's just what it is.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.160]   So don't even give yourself the option.
[00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:52.680]   And then have a scheduling philosophy.
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:54.560]   So it's, this is when I do deep work.
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:56.880]   And we have a question about that coming up later.
[00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:58.440]   And then add rituals around it too.
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:01.560]   I get this coffee, I go to this room, I have a different location.
[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:06.560]   All of that is basically trying to trick our instinct, which is not in this article, but
[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:07.560]   I think it's a good point.
[00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:09.760]   We're not wired for deep work.
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:10.760]   That's pretty artificial.
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:16.400]   I mean, we are hijacking sophisticated components of our brain that were meant for doing things
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:20.840]   like constructing and evaluating plans or simulating the minds of other people so we
[00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:22.680]   can do complex social interactions.
[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:26.240]   We're hijacking that to do symbolic abstract thinking.
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:32.440]   And this was not a big part of the Paleolithic, trying to figure out a complex abstract strategy.
[00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:33.440]   Yeah.
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:38.600]   Yeah, I've heard you say that stuff a bunch, but I always like hearing it more.
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:40.720]   Yeah, it's hard.
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:41.960]   Deep work is hard.
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:45.080]   But maybe these type of things will make it easier.
[00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:46.280]   All right.
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:50.160]   So we have coming up soon here, a live call.
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:54.920]   So I'll tackle a conversation with one of you live, one of our listeners.
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:59.800]   I first want to mention, however, a sponsor that helps make the Deep Questions podcast
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:00.800]   possible.
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:02.920]   And that is our friends at Hinson shaving.
[00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:06.240]   Jesse, will you say my shave looks pretty good today?
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:07.360]   Yeah.
[00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:11.360]   You would not be a good spokesperson for Hinson's with your artful.
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:12.520]   I go back and forth a lot.
[00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:13.520]   Yeah.
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:14.520]   When you have the artful beard stubble.
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:15.520]   Yeah.
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:16.520]   It's white now.
[00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:17.520]   Yeah, so is mine.
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:18.520]   It's true.
[00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:22.040]   When I grow a beard out a little bit, it's white in there.
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:24.200]   So I shave it and I shave it with Hinson's.
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:25.200]   All right.
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:26.200]   So you've heard me talk about them before.
[00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:27.200]   Here's why.
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.840]   You know, I like quality.
[00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:32.760]   You know, I like something designed and implemented really well.
[00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:35.600]   That's what you get with Hinson's shaving.
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:40.800]   It's actually a company that specialize in doing precision parts manufacturing for the
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:42.080]   aerospace industry.
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:43.820]   We're talking parts on the Mars Rover.
[00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:47.000]   We're talking parts on the International Space Station.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:53.560]   And they have these super high precision CNC routers they can use to build metal things
[00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:55.680]   to incredible precision.
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:24:00.320]   So they put this to work for designing a razor.
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:06.720]   And so the Hinson's razor is beautifully manufactured, very precise piece of solid aluminum.
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:14.200]   You take a standard 10 cent safety razor blade and you put it on the Hinson's razor and you
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:16.640]   screw the base to tighten it together.
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:20.300]   And this thing is so precisely built that you only have point, and I'm looking at the
[00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:29.460]   number here, 0013 inches of the blade emerging past the edge on either side of the razor.
[00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:34.800]   So this eliminates the diving board effect you get with cheaper blades where the edge
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:36.800]   of the blade can move up and down.
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:38.220]   And that's what gives you nicks.
[00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:39.220]   That's what can give you burn.
[00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:45.040]   When you have just less than the thickness of a human hair sticking beyond the edge of
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:50.820]   your razor, you can get this very firm blade edge, which does a really nice cut.
[00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:55.380]   And what I love about it is you're just spending 10 cent on the blade.
[00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:59.060]   All of the magic is in the razor itself and this really nice piece of aluminum.
[00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:04.820]   So you pay more up front for this beautiful piece of metal, but then going forward, you're
[00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:08.440]   not paying very expensive monthly subscriptions for a subscription service.
[00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:13.280]   You're not going to the drugstore and buying those incredibly expensive plastic disposable
[00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:19.480]   blades where I believe it's up to now 19, but 19 different blades and the one big plastic
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:21.240]   contraction or whatever it is.
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:28.360]   You just have 10 cent safety razors, safety razor blades in this beautiful actual metal
[00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:30.880]   razor and you get the really good shave from it.
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:31.920]   You can keep it forever.
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:33.640]   You can use it your whole life.
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:34.760]   I am a big fan.
[00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:38.960]   It is the razor that I use.
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:43.240]   So it's time to say no to subscriptions and yes to a razor that will last you a lifetime.
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:50.560]   Visit HinsonShaving.com/Cal, they picked a razor for you and use code CAL and you will
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:54.680]   get two years worth of blades for free with your razor.
[00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:58.640]   Just make sure you add them to your cart and then use that promo code when you check out
[00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:02.160]   and the cost of the blades will drop to zero.
[00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:12.120]   That's 100 free blades when you head to HinsonShaving.com/Cal and use that code CAL.
[00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:18.880]   I also want to talk about our friends at Rhone, R-H-O-N-E.
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:26.000]   As we've talked about before on the show, I'd long been a fan of Rhone's athletic t-shirts
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.160]   because they look, they looked great.
[00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:31.960]   They were breathable, they were flexible, they were high quality.
[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:35.300]   That's what I wear basically every day in the summer here in DC.
[00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:40.480]   It's why I was excited to find out that they now have a dress shirt.
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:44.700]   They call it the commuter shirt and it's the most comfortable, breathable and flexible
[00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:47.820]   shirt known to man.
[00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:48.820]   And here's why.
[00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:54.400]   It has Rhone's comfortable four-way stretch fabric, the same stuff I loved in their t-shirts.
[00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:57.840]   This gives you breathability and flexibility.
[00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:59.800]   It's wrinkle free.
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:03.200]   This is why I like the commuter shirt when I travel to a conference, when I travel to
[00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:07.960]   give a talk, throw the Rhone commuter shirt in my bag, it's going to look great.
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:11.000]   It's not going to be covered in wrinkles like a cotton shirt would.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.760]   And it has GoldFusion anti-odor technology.
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:17.640]   So you know, when you're up on stage and it's hot out, it's hot and you're really getting
[00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:20.860]   into it about deep work, the shirt's going to stay fresh.
[00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:23.220]   It's going to take care of that sweat.
[00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:27.960]   You're not going to end up after smelling weird.
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:30.160]   So I love the commuter shirt.
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:31.160]   It is lightweight.
[00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:32.160]   I really like this.
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:33.160]   I mean, I get hot, I run hot.
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:35.760]   It's very lightweight, very flexible.
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:36.760]   So I really do.
[00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:42.920]   For me, this is my, I need to be exuding a lot of energy on a stage or in a classroom
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:45.920]   or on a multi-hour podcast interview.
[00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:48.200]   And I want to look good, but I don't want to get too hot.
[00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:49.960]   The commuter shirt is my new go-to.
[00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:57.120]   So Rhone, good for you for bringing your technology into this particular space of fashion.
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:01.520]   So the commuter shirt can get you through any workday and straight into whatever comes
[00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:02.520]   next.
[00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:07.840]   Head to Rhone.com/Cal and use the promo code Cal to save 20% off your entire order.
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:16.680]   That's 20% off your entire order when you head to R-H-O-N-E.com/Cal and use code Cal.
[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:20.040]   It's time to find your corner office comfort.
[00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:26.240]   All right, Jesse, let's talk to a real live person.
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:30.360]   Just a reminder for anyone else who wants to potentially do a live call on our show,
[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:32.880]   here's how you sign up.
[00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:37.040]   Just go submit a question like you normally would using the survey link that's right there
[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:38.080]   in the show notes.
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:43.120]   At the bottom, it says, would you be willing to do this question on the show live?
[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:46.040]   And if so, give us your email address and just put your address down there.
[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:50.800]   If we think it's a good fit for the show, we will let you know and get you on the line.
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:55.600]   All right, Jesse, let's see who we have on the line today.
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:57.640]   Looks good.
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:03.040]   Finny, thank you for calling in to the Deep Questions podcast.
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:05.680]   What is your question you have for me today?
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:07.200]   Hi, Cal.
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:08.200]   Yeah.
[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:13.160]   So my question revolves around understanding my limits and setting boundaries to respect
[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:14.160]   that.
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:21.720]   Specifically, I've noticed that I have a habit of taking on too much and overworking myself.
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:27.400]   So I'm looking for recommendations around parameters and guiding questions I should
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:31.920]   keep in the back of my mind so that I can recognize when this is happening and start
[00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:34.200]   to dial back before burnout sets in.
[00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:35.200]   Right.
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:41.640]   Well, a great question, because I hear similar complaints or similar concerns from a lot
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:42.640]   of my listeners.
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:45.320]   Why don't we start by getting a little bit more background?
[00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:52.400]   Could you walk us through, for example, a recent example in your life where you took
[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:55.440]   on too much and the type of damage that caused?
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:58.040]   Yeah, sure thing.
[00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:05.400]   So my full-time job, I work in finance, and that's my full-time job.
[00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:11.820]   But then on my nights and weekends, I like to tinker with Internet-type stuff, like taking
[00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:16.880]   pictures with my smartphone and writing things that I'm interested in writing about.
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:26.000]   And then about a month ago, I got a scholarship to do a master's level program, which was
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.680]   self-paced, so I thought I had some wiggle room.
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:37.400]   But as I started the program, I realized, well, one, I didn't have my study work on
[00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:38.400]   autopilots.
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:43.520]   And, you know, I know from previous experience that going two, three weeks into that kind
[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:49.760]   of program, if you're not on autopilot, it's really difficult to do well in the classes.
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:54.840]   And so, you know, what I ended up doing was just dropping the class, and I figured I'll
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:56.360]   try again another time.
[00:30:56.360 --> 00:31:04.080]   But it was just too much to add, you know, full-time work plus hobbies and, you know,
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:09.240]   commitments like being part of a family and having friends that I want to keep in touch
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:12.080]   with and then adding school on top of that.
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:13.080]   Right.
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:19.480]   So you were trying, with your full-time job and other nonprofessional commitments, you
[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:23.560]   were adding in coursework, and you were doing so without the structure of an autopilot.
[00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:25.720]   So I hear this correctly, you were basically kind of winging it.
[00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:28.240]   Hey, what do I need to work on today?
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:31.240]   Was that the situation in which the course became too much?
[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:32.240]   Yeah.
[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:35.960]   Well, yeah, so the course became too much, I think, for two reasons.
[00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:43.320]   For one, I felt like I wasn't, when I sat down to model what a week, a typical week
[00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:51.680]   could look like, I felt like I didn't prioritize the relationships I wanted.
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:55.000]   I didn't give them a high enough priority outside of work.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:02.520]   And then on top of that, I wasn't able to get my study work on autopilot quickly enough.
[00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:06.880]   And I wasn't willing to jeopardize, like, sacrifice those relationships.
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:12.560]   And you know, with the autopilot not in place, it didn't make sense to stick with it.
[00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:13.560]   Yeah.
[00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:20.640]   Well, OK, I think you did the right thing in trying to sketch out an autopilot schedule
[00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:21.640]   that made sense.
[00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:24.520]   And this is what I'm going to lean into in my answer here.
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:29.680]   The exercise I think is going to be most revealing for you is actually going through the process
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:32.840]   of, as we say, facing the productivity dragon.
[00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:38.080]   And in this case, it's going to be actually working out a sample week schedule.
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:41.160]   Here's work, here's other things happening in my life.
[00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:44.360]   Here's all of the different work I need to do for my class.
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:45.600]   Let me find time for that.
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:46.640]   Let me go through this experiment.
[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:49.840]   So this is for the listeners who don't know what the autopilot schedule is.
[00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:55.560]   That's what it is, finding regular times for regularly occurring work.
[00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:57.260]   Work that all out for a week.
[00:32:57.260 --> 00:33:04.220]   And if you stare at that and says, this doesn't work, that is a really useful signal.
[00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:05.860]   That is a signal not to ignore.
[00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:08.380]   That is a signal that this isn't going to fit.
[00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:10.980]   I actually need more time if this is going to work.
[00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:15.760]   And if I can't generate more time, let's say by temporarily reconfiguring my work, maybe
[00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:18.600]   I have a half day on this day where I can catch up on a lot more work.
[00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:23.520]   If you can't find the time, if the schedule doesn't fit, we have to actually face that
[00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:26.360]   reality and say there's going to have to be a significant change.
[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:29.880]   I mean, that's often how I tell people to figure out if there's too much going on is
[00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:34.160]   to actually stare at everything that's going on, move those puzzle pieces and say, does
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:37.640]   this actually fit into a reasonable, sustainable schedule?
[00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:41.040]   And if it doesn't, let that be the motivation to make some sort, there's going to have to
[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:42.880]   be some sort of larger change.
[00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:43.880]   Something is going to have to give.
[00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:47.040]   And again, it could be a slight reconfiguration of work.
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:50.880]   It could be a slight reconfiguration of your life outside of work.
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:53.120]   The hobbies are going on the back burner.
[00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:55.000]   Saturdays are now dedicated to my course.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.600]   I don't want to do this forever.
[00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:58.240]   I can do this for a semester.
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:03.280]   It might be that or it might be I can't do these two things at the same time.
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:06.680]   And this is the evidence that I have actually facing me.
[00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:07.680]   How does that seem to you?
[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:08.680]   How's that sound?
[00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:13.720]   This idea of actually just seeing the schedule and accepting what you see as it is, you know,
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:16.280]   not wistfully thinking, but looking at the reality.
[00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:17.280]   Right.
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:18.280]   Yeah.
[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:20.320]   I mean, it was difficult.
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:27.360]   I think it was difficult to come to that conclusion that, you know, I looked at it, tried different
[00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:35.200]   configurations and it just didn't, it was too much to, there was a mental load with
[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:39.400]   that that I couldn't hold in my head.
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:45.120]   And so that's why it made sense to say, okay, well, you know, the chance to go to school
[00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:48.440]   is probably going to come up again.
[00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:54.040]   And ultimately I think what I'm going to do is scale back a little bit and just do a smaller
[00:34:54.040 --> 00:35:03.160]   portion of that program and then pick up more later as opportunity presents itself as my
[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:04.160]   career progresses.
[00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:07.960]   Well, I mean, Finney, this makes sense to me.
[00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:13.320]   I mean, what you're saying you did, this is more now a case study than a question.
[00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:17.200]   And the way I'm going to try to make this concrete for the audience is that this is
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:24.240]   the difference between a calendar centric approach to your life and a resume centric
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:25.360]   approach to your life.
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:30.200]   So the resume centric approach is all I'm walking in here is how would this look to
[00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:31.200]   be on my resume?
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:34.040]   Oh, it would be really cool to have this degree would be really useful.
[00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:35.920]   Oh, it'd be really cool to have written a novel.
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:36.920]   So why don't I do this?
[00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:38.280]   Oh, I want to run a marathon.
[00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:39.280]   That would look cool.
[00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:40.600]   Let me start training for a marathon.
[00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:44.760]   It's just managing that list of things that you want to display.
[00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:49.200]   The calendar centric approach to your life is looking at the time you have available.
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:53.400]   And when you're trying to understand what mix of activities to bring into your life,
[00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:55.240]   saying, does this fit?
[00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:58.840]   Does the life to show me when I'm looking at how much time I'll have?
[00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:00.620]   Does that seem sustainable?
[00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:02.440]   That's what you were doing.
[00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:04.080]   That's by the way, how I approach my life.
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:09.680]   I get that exact same sinking feeling in my gut when I'm staring at my calendar and it's
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:11.280]   not working.
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:12.360]   My wife knows this.
[00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:14.600]   This is what she thinks of as Monday morning syndrome.
[00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:19.200]   When I'm doing a weekly plan Monday morning in a period where my schedule has got too
[00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:24.360]   complex, I just feel terrible because I'm forced to stare at the calendar and it doesn't
[00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:26.560]   fit and nothing makes me more unhappy.
[00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:28.080]   We got to trust that gut.
[00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:32.360]   So I'm going to say you have my stamp of approval for exactly how you thought of this.
[00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:36.140]   And I'm actually going to thank you for sharing a case study with everyone else about how
[00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:41.000]   this calendar centric thinking really leads to more sustainable lifestyle.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.620]   You're still going to do awesome things.
[00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:43.620]   You're going to go to school.
[00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:47.360]   I think you're going to find an opportunity going forward where maybe you're going to
[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:52.080]   be able to officially work this in with your job at some opportunity in the future.
[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:53.640]   There's going to be a reduction in your hours.
[00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:54.640]   You can have time.
[00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:55.720]   There's going to be a sabbatical.
[00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:59.040]   I'm not sure how it's going to play out, but you know what you're looking for now.
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:02.400]   So I have no doubt that you're going to continue to do cool things.
[00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:06.620]   But I give you my stamp of approval for this approach to actually tackling this particular
[00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:07.620]   issue.
[00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:10.980]   So hopefully that makes you feel better, Finney, but I'm giving you a thumbs up.
[00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:11.980]   Right on.
[00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:12.980]   Thank you very much.
[00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:18.340]   And I will say that I think, you know, I'm coming out of the, I just finished using the
[00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:24.020]   first my set, my first version of your, your weekly planner.
[00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:25.980]   And I think that that helped a lot.
[00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:29.740]   So please, please, thank you very much for doing this.
[00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:30.740]   And I hope you continue.
[00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:31.740]   All right.
[00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:32.740]   Thank you very much, Finney.
[00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:33.740]   And keep me posted for sure.
[00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:34.740]   We want to hear how this goes.
[00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:35.740]   Okay.
[00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:36.740]   All right.
[00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:37.740]   Well, that was fun.
[00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:40.220]   It's really nice talking to people back and forth.
[00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:43.860]   That's something different, but we don't want to neglect the bread and butter here, of course,
[00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:46.360]   which is the written questions that you submit.
[00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:48.380]   So let's get into some of those.
[00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:53.580]   Jesse, what's our first written question of the show?
[00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:56.060]   First question is from Hari.
[00:37:56.060 --> 00:38:01.140]   How do I apply the journalistic mode of scheduling deep work when I'm feeling exhausted and fatigued
[00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:02.140]   most of the time?
[00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:07.820]   We'll just do a quick preview here or review, I should say, not preview, review of what
[00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:12.740]   he means by the journalistic mode of scheduling deep work.
[00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:20.260]   In my book, Deep Work, I said, you have to have a scheduling philosophy, some sort of
[00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:24.340]   strategy or philosophy about this is how I schedule deep work sessions.
[00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:26.300]   You need some sort of philosophy or strategy.
[00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:28.180]   You cannot just wing it.
[00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:31.120]   You cannot just say, I'll wait, tell him in the mood to do deep work and have nothing
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:33.260]   else going on, and then I'll actually get into it.
[00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:35.980]   If that's your plan, you're never going to do deep work.
[00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:41.980]   So in the book, I said, OK, let me give you some examples of general categories of deep
[00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:45.940]   work scheduling strategies that I have seen people succeed with.
[00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:52.180]   And I gave three, three different examples, three different categories, rhythmic, bimodal
[00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:53.900]   and journalistic.
[00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:58.980]   So Hari is asking about the journalistic mode of deep work scheduling, how to succeed with
[00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:02.660]   that and in particular, how to succeed with that when he finds himself overworked and
[00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:04.900]   tired in his elaboration.
[00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:07.860]   I'll point out he's a CEO of a startup, I believe.
[00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:10.180]   So he's someone who has a lot going on.
[00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:13.780]   So to answer that question, let's just do the quick run through of what all three of
[00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:17.580]   these scheduling strategies entail.
[00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:22.660]   Rhythmic scheduling of deep work is perhaps the most obvious.
[00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:25.900]   You work the same times on the same days, week after week.
[00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:30.880]   So when you hear someone say, I get up at six, I work on my novel for 90 minutes every
[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:33.320]   morning before I get ready and go to work.
[00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:34.540]   That's the rhythmic schedule.
[00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:38.200]   When you hear people say, I don't teach on Fridays.
[00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:41.400]   So from 10 to four on Fridays is all research.
[00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:42.400]   That's the rhythmic schedule.
[00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:44.220]   It's the same time, same day, same week.
[00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:45.940]   So you don't have to think about it.
[00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:48.060]   You just know when the deep work happens.
[00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:50.420]   Your brain gets used to the idea of that when deep work happens as well.
[00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:53.420]   So you can get into the mode easier.
[00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:55.040]   Bimodal is more extreme.
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:58.160]   It's where you go back and forth between two different modes where either you're doing
[00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:03.900]   no deep work or you're in a mode where all you are doing is deep work.
[00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:06.920]   And this applies on different types of timescale.
[00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:12.940]   So if you take a summer to write your book as an academic and then don't work on the
[00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:15.780]   book during the academic year, that's bimodal.
[00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:20.660]   In the book deep work, I give the example of professor and author Adam Grant, who implemented
[00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:24.160]   bimodal on a smaller timescale.
[00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:27.940]   So he would go two or three days in a row where he was doing nothing but deep work on
[00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:30.340]   his research, completely unreachable.
[00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:33.080]   And then when he was out of those sessions, he was 100% reachable.
[00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:34.460]   My door is open.
[00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:36.540]   Adam's really big on answering emails quickly.
[00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:39.460]   And so he would just go back and forth between these modes.
[00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:42.060]   Carl Jung, this opened the book deep work.
[00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:47.220]   I talked about Carl Jung going to Bollingen Tower, this fairy tale inspired stone house
[00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:52.200]   he built on the shore of Lake Geneva near the town of Bollingen.
[00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:54.360]   That was a bimodal work philosophy.
[00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:57.720]   When he was in Zurich, very busy.
[00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:02.060]   When he would go out to his fairy tale house on the lake, he would lock himself in a meditation
[00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:03.880]   room and just think.
[00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:04.880]   Different modes.
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:11.120]   Journalistic, which is what Hari is asking about, is where you look at the days or time
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:14.640]   ahead and sort of figure out on the fly, when am I going to have time to do deep work?
[00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:18.000]   So it's one week will look different than another.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.280]   You're finding room for deep work sessions where you can.
[00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:26.800]   I call it the journalistic method because journalists often get really good at I find
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:27.800]   times to write.
[00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:28.800]   I just have to write.
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:29.800]   I'm on location.
[00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:30.960]   I'm reporting on an election.
[00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:35.280]   I'm reporting on a war and I just the work has to get done.
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:40.240]   I'm just going to sit down and write my article draft right now in the back of this truck.
[00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:43.400]   So that's why I call it the journalistic method.
[00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:47.320]   So how do you succeed with the journalistic method?
[00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:52.840]   I argue more recently, I typically argue that this is best implemented at the weekly scale.
[00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:58.800]   So when you're doing your weekly plan, you find those times when you're going to do deep
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:04.000]   work that week and you schedule them on your calendar like you would any other meeting.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.860]   The reason why this is journalistic and not rhythmic or bimodal is that it's not rhythmic
[00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:11.800]   because the days and times you deep work depend on the week.
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:13.560]   So it's not regular.
[00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:16.640]   So this week I have a busy Tuesday, but Wednesday, nothing's happening until noon.
[00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:19.600]   So I'm going to take Wednesday morning the next week, Wednesday is hard, like a horror
[00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:20.600]   show.
[00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:22.760]   But if I do Tuesday and Thursday morning, I have time to do deep work.
[00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:24.560]   There's different from week to week.
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:29.720]   It's also not bimodal because you're not spending one or more days just in a state of deep work.
[00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:33.720]   The sessions fit within a day that have other types of activities.
[00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:39.360]   So my own life in when I wrote deep work, I said I'd mainly do journalistic.
[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:42.360]   I would say now that varies.
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:47.220]   So I'm writing a book right now in a semester where I'm not teaching.
[00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:52.020]   So I have a big queue of deep work efforts and a lot more flexibility on my schedule.
[00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:55.440]   So I have more of a rhythmic thing going where almost every morning I work on the book first
[00:42:55.440 --> 00:43:01.720]   thing and then I hybridize that with journalistic scheduling by adding extra blocks on different
[00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:05.200]   days depending on what's happening in my schedule.
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:11.080]   So Hari, to get to your question about exhaustion.
[00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:14.440]   So how do you succeed with this when you find that you are exhausted by the time you get
[00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:18.600]   to these scheduled blocks is I would say two things.
[00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:20.920]   One, do less.
[00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:24.880]   So you're exhausted may just be a symptom of you have too much going on.
[00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:25.880]   Your brain is fatigued.
[00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:27.960]   I mean, you're exhausting your brain.
[00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:31.000]   It's not your scheduling systems fault necessarily that you're exhausted when it comes time to
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   do deep work.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.320]   You're asking too much of your brain.
[00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:39.160]   If you are an athlete and you said, look, I'm having trouble doing this particular type
[00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:42.560]   of training because my muscles are so fatigued by the time I get there, I would say if that
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:46.120]   type of training is important, then you need to do less exercise of other types.
[00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:49.000]   You're burning out your body.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.400]   The second thing I would suggest is if you're dealing with overwork and exhaustion, you
[00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:57.600]   might want to step away from the journalistic and head towards the rhythmic.
[00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:03.600]   The rhythmic schedule scheduling philosophy can deal better with heavy workloads, especially
[00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:07.180]   if the rhythmic approach is first thing in the morning.
[00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:09.880]   First thing I do every day when my energy is the highest is a little bit of deep work
[00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:11.100]   on this thing is important.
[00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:16.600]   That's probably the most resistant, the most fatigue resistant deep work scheduling strategy
[00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:18.520]   that's out there.
[00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:23.960]   So if you've got a lot going on, simplify your deep work life first thing in the morning,
[00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:27.400]   you have better luck with that, and then see if you can actually just reduce the total
[00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:28.840]   load of work you're doing.
[00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:32.280]   Because again, if you're overworking your mind, you're overworking your mind and there's no
[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:38.120]   system that can reverse that reality.
[00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:41.400]   All right, Jesse, what do we got next?
[00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:45.520]   Next question is from Roger, a senior level consultant in Wisconsin.
[00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:50.040]   For midsize projects such as preparing a large proposal for a new client, my tendency is
[00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:53.360]   to allow the effort to fill the available time up to the deadline.
[00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:56.560]   How do I know when something is good enough to be done?
[00:44:56.560 --> 00:45:02.400]   Yeah, these type of perfectionist issues are common, especially in knowledge work where
[00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:05.620]   you have many different things you're being asked to do.
[00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:09.160]   It can be psychologically difficult at some point to say this is good enough, let's move
[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:11.120]   on.
[00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:15.920]   If you can't get to that point, you end up like Roger is talking about here, feeling
[00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:20.320]   every minute staying up late, letting other things fall on the wayside because you're
[00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:24.800]   just not quite comfortable finishing because it could be better.
[00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:25.800]   What about this?
[00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:26.880]   What about that?
[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:32.640]   And that can be damaging both psychologically, but also to your career prospects.
[00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:37.080]   So one thing I would recommend, Roger, is clearly identifying the subset of things you
[00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:42.280]   do in your job that are what I call needle mover activities.
[00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:46.180]   These are the things that really make the biggest difference in your career.
[00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:50.520]   These are probably gonna be the things that most heavily leverage your hard won skills
[00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:54.240]   and or produce the most value for your organization.
[00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:58.480]   These are the things if you can do them at a very high level, will give you leverage
[00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:00.680]   over everything else.
[00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:02.120]   This is what we care about, right?
[00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:08.680]   So if you are a ad copywriter, a madman type situation, it's like how effective are the
[00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:10.560]   ad campaigns you're writing?
[00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:12.700]   Are they actually generating a lot of business for clients?
[00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:13.960]   That's the needle mover activity.
[00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:20.640]   If you're the developer at a startup, how crisp and robust is your code?
[00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:24.600]   If you can write really sharp code that's very stable and very efficient, man, that's
[00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:25.600]   what matters.
[00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:28.880]   That's what allows our product to work.
[00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:32.520]   It saves us all these hours of repair and support.
[00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:33.640]   It's the skill that matters.
[00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:35.640]   If you're a professor, papers.
[00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:40.380]   Are you writing papers that are attracting citations and are being published in top venues?
[00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:42.280]   These are needle mover activities.
[00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:46.080]   Once you clearly identify what the needle mover activities are, you can be much more
[00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:49.440]   comfortable with the psychological toll of saying this is good enough with everything
[00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:50.440]   else.
[00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:53.200]   So you're the ad copywriter.
[00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:55.440]   This is the thing that really matters.
[00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:58.840]   When there's a one-off thing you're asked to do, like, "Hey, can you get together client
[00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:01.780]   testimonials for our website?"
[00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:05.360]   You're more comfortable saying like, "I'll just do a good enough job.
[00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:06.680]   I found some testimonials.
[00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:07.680]   I made a plan.
[00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:08.680]   I found them.
[00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:09.680]   I checked them.
[00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:10.680]   I did it on time.
[00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:11.680]   It's at a reasonable level of quality.
[00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:12.680]   Great.
[00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:13.680]   Let me get back to the thing I really care about."
[00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:15.160]   You're a professor doing a committee.
[00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:20.000]   "Let me make sure I'm responsible and reasonable and I show up and do the stuff I say I'm going
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   to do.
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:24.560]   I don't want to hand in crap, but I'm keeping this pretty contained.
[00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:29.160]   I have an hour for it here, a half hour for it here, and I'm happy with just that's good
[00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:30.160]   enough."
[00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:35.680]   So when you know what really matters, you don't sweat so much about the stuff that doesn't
[00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:38.800]   matter so much.
[00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:45.080]   Now keep in mind, if you don't take this approach, if you instead fall back on the perfectionist
[00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:51.720]   approach, "I just want everything to be beautiful," this can actually be counterproductive for
[00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:53.880]   your career.
[00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:58.080]   If people learn, "Oh, you are someone that no matter what I give them is going to do,
[00:47:58.080 --> 00:48:02.760]   they're going to obsess about it and it's going to be 2x better than I would do myself.
[00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:06.260]   If I tell them to get client testimonials, it's going to be they're going to find all
[00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:09.480]   these different testimonials and go back and get them revised and they're going to find
[00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:13.240]   images and it's going to be really great for the website.
[00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:16.920]   I'm going to start wanting you to do more and more of these things.
[00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:20.920]   You will become my go-to person for these type of activities."
[00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:24.440]   And what you're going to find yourself then is drowning in what in the research literature
[00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:26.920]   they called non-promotable activities.
[00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:30.680]   So activities that are not directly related to the main thing you do.
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:33.920]   You're the professor who everyone wants on their committees because you really do such
[00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:36.160]   a good job, but now you can't do your research.
[00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:39.440]   And that's what ultimately matters for you keeping your job.
[00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:44.200]   The ad copywriter that everyone wants to pull onto their internal facing initiatives because
[00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:46.240]   they know that stuff will get done.
[00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:49.280]   And because of that, you're not producing the award-winning campaigns on which you could
[00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:51.480]   build your career.
[00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:55.680]   So there's a cost beyond just the psychology of, "Oh, my schedule is full because I can't
[00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:56.680]   let things go."
[00:48:56.680 --> 00:49:01.440]   There's a cost to your career trajectory if you're too good at too many things.
[00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:03.640]   Put your energy into the needle moving activities.
[00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:07.240]   Be a reasonable, responsible human on everything else.
[00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:08.280]   "I won't be late.
[00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:11.520]   I won't drop the ball and I'll be fine."
[00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:14.880]   But I'm not really trying to blow you away with the stuff that doesn't really matter.
[00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:19.800]   I think it's actually better for your career growth paradoxically to be worse at some things
[00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:21.200]   and better at others.
[00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:24.240]   It's not the case that be as good as possible at all the things you do is actually going
[00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:29.320]   to be the fastest route to progression inside your career.
[00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:32.400]   All right.
[00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:33.400]   Rolling right along here.
[00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:34.400]   What do we got next?
[00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:35.400]   All right.
[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:38.960]   Next question is from Mettie, a 30-year-old engineer and PhD candidate.
[00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:42.080]   "I work full-time and do a part-time PhD.
[00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:43.640]   I'm currently writing my dissertation.
[00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:47.520]   I have the opportunity to take up to two months off work next year.
[00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:51.440]   I fantasize about using it to go deep into a deep immersion mode.
[00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:55.840]   Maybe even spend a portion of that time in a cabin or room elsewhere where all I do is
[00:49:55.840 --> 00:50:00.000]   wake up, drink coffee, and write, take deep walks.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.800]   Is this a good idea or should I write more gradually?"
[00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:06.760]   So, I think you should write more gradually.
[00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:14.880]   I think if you tried to contain your dissertation writing to two months in a cabin, you're going
[00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:20.080]   to get cabin fever and a far from complete dissertation.
[00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:22.560]   That's not really the right way to do this.
[00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:26.520]   What I would recommend doing instead is a more slow accumulation strategy.
[00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:30.480]   I would say maybe four to five mornings a week, and you can use a weekend morning in
[00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:31.480]   there.
[00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:35.240]   Maybe in the morning when your energy is highest before you go to your other job, you're working
[00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:37.480]   on your dissertation.
[00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:41.200]   One to two hours of very sharp thinking.
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:45.640]   You're collecting maximally sharp thinking day after day after day.
[00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:50.080]   If you work all day in a cabin, maybe you have two hours in there that are particularly
[00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:54.880]   sharp and seven hours in there where you're exhausted, but because you're in the stupid
[00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:57.360]   cabin and have nothing else to do, you're kind of trying to force the work and trying
[00:50:57.360 --> 00:50:58.700]   to keep things going.
[00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:04.560]   If you work one to two hours a day, it's sharp, sharp, sharp, sharp, and that accumulates.
[00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:12.320]   This chapter that took 15 days to write is 15 days worth of sharp thinking, and it shows.
[00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:14.760]   Slow but steady, carefully building.
[00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:18.880]   Everything you do is not too much, but what you do is really good, really sharp.
[00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:22.280]   That's probably the better way if you're working on a dissertation part time.
[00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:24.400]   That's the better way to do it.
[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:26.400]   Two extra things I'll say there.
[00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:32.000]   Instead of spending two months on an unpaid leave to write your dissertation, take a one
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:35.000]   day of vacation every two to three weeks.
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:38.280]   So now you can throw into your mix every couple of weeks.
[00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:43.060]   I take a day off from my main job, and it's a day that I can go super deep on.
[00:51:43.060 --> 00:51:45.960]   Maybe there's like a really complicated thing.
[00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:47.600]   What's the thesis for this chapter?
[00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:48.600]   I really got to figure that out.
[00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:50.880]   Then I can write it for two weeks, but I really got to figure out what I'm saying.
[00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:54.720]   I'm going to take a day off and walk the woods and think.
[00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:56.040]   Do that every two to three weeks.
[00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:59.320]   You're going to get way more bang for the buck out of that than putting all those days
[00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:03.040]   together and having the pressure of everything has to come out of this.
[00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:08.440]   The second thing I'll say is where a retreat typically is more useful in this type of work
[00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:10.960]   is closer to the end.
[00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:11.960]   I've been working on this a while.
[00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:14.960]   I have most of my ideas down.
[00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:17.640]   There's 50 small things that have to happen for this dissertation to finish.
[00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:21.040]   I have to go back and do this, and I have to change all these citations, and I have
[00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:22.520]   to figure out a conclusion for this.
[00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:26.200]   There's all these little small things that have to happen, and I feel like all these
[00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:28.120]   loose ends will never get tied up.
[00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:30.840]   That's where taking two weeks could be really effective.
[00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:32.400]   I'm going to shut this thing down.
[00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:34.560]   I'm going to close down this project and get it out the door.
[00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:35.560]   I'm close.
[00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:37.520]   Now let's push it to the finish line.
[00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:39.840]   That is effective for taking time off.
[00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:45.960]   To do the whole project in a period of concentrated work like that, I think that's unlikely to
[00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:47.240]   be as successful.
[00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:49.920]   I think slow and steady is the way to go.
[00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:56.200]   Jesse, this comes up in book writing a lot, especially in nonfiction.
[00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:59.720]   You'll see this often, especially in pragmatic nonfiction, so non-full-time writers.
[00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:05.960]   They're like, "Okay, I'm going to write this book on whatever, marketing."
[00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:11.600]   You hear people say this all the time, like, "Oh, I locked myself away for six weeks and
[00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:14.120]   just pounded out the book."
[00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:19.000]   That's going to be a really bad book because most of those hours are going to be fatigued
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:20.000]   hours.
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:23.640]   Most of those hours are going to be pulling from an already emptied reservoir of creative
[00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:25.040]   insight.
[00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:26.280]   It's going to be a book that's forced.
[00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:29.400]   It's going to be a book that feels like writing for the sake of writing, a book that's full
[00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:34.000]   of lazy colloquialisms, rhetorical questions, and conversational tone because you're just
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:38.120]   trying to fill in those pages because you have four or five more hours to go.
[00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:41.480]   Professional writers who write really good books, work, work, work, work, work, work,
[00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:44.520]   work, work, day after day, week after week, month after month, are coming at it sharp,
[00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:48.120]   day after day, day after day, and they're building this thing very carefully.
[00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:49.920]   That's how really good work comes out.
[00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:52.000]   I see this in nonfiction writing all the time.
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:57.000]   As soon as I see a writer brag about, "I was in monk mode in a cabin for two months and
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:00.720]   did nothing but write this book," I immediately think this is not going to be a good book.
[00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:01.720]   That's interesting.
[00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:02.720]   The writing's not going to be good.
[00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:06.520]   All right, what do we got next?
[00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:08.560]   Next question is from Carl.
[00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:12.520]   Have you read Tyler Cowen and Daniel Gross' recent book, Talent?
[00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:16.880]   I'm curious what you think about their claim that answering email quickly is a good marker
[00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:17.880]   of talent.
[00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:25.080]   Well, I haven't read Talent yet, but I do find it to be a safe bet to not disagree with
[00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:29.080]   Tyler Cowen when the opportunity arises.
[00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:34.480]   So I tracked down the particular paragraph that Carl's referring to here, and it looks
[00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:40.040]   like if I found the right passage, there's a conversation between Cowen and who I assume
[00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:46.400]   is Sam Altman, the former president of Y Combinator, the current president of OpenAI.
[00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:54.360]   So Cowen asks, "How quickly should someone answer your email to count as quick and decisive?"
[00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:58.560]   And Altman says, "You know, years ago, I wrote a little program to look at this, like how
[00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:02.440]   quickly our best founders, the founders that run billion-dollar-plus companies, answer
[00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:04.440]   my emails versus our bad founders.
[00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:07.480]   I don't remember the exact data, but it was mind-blowingly different.
[00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:11.960]   It was a difference of minutes versus days on average response times."
[00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:14.080]   And then it zooms out from that conversation.
[00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:19.200]   So I think this might be Cowen or Daniel commenting on that exchange.
[00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:23.360]   And they write, "In essence, this quality of speed of response is picking up on how
[00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:27.720]   much the individual is focused on being connected to the world and responding to plausibly important
[00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:28.720]   queries."
[00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:30.080]   All right.
[00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:35.600]   So that, of course, seems like it's in direct contradiction to everything I'm warning about
[00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:40.200]   in a world without email where I talk about quick responses like that means you have to
[00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:41.640]   constantly be checking inboxes.
[00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:45.560]   If you're constantly checking inboxes, you're constantly in a state of attention residue,
[00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:48.680]   which means you have a drastically reduced cognitive capacity.
[00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:54.960]   Now, my argument is a psychological and neurologically verifiable hypothesis.
[00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:57.080]   I think the evidence there is clear.
[00:55:57.080 --> 00:56:03.680]   If you are keeping up with digital conversations as a priority, you cannot produce complicated
[00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:07.440]   thought matter at the same level, the same speed or level of quality as someone who is
[00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:10.000]   not context switching.
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:13.060]   That doesn't, however, mean that Sam is wrong.
[00:56:13.060 --> 00:56:20.080]   And that's because he's talking about founders of early stage startups.
[00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:23.920]   That is a very specific place to be in the world of work.
[00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:28.280]   And it is a place that I talk about in my book, Deep Work.
[00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:33.400]   So in Deep Work, I specifically pull up the example of Jack Dorsey, who at the time was
[00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:36.600]   the CEO of both Twitter and Square.
[00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:42.280]   And I go through his schedule because it was considered so unusual to be a CEO of two companies
[00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:43.680]   at the same time.
[00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:47.680]   A lot of articles were written that got into the details of how Jack Dorsey worked out
[00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:48.680]   his schedule.
[00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:54.240]   So we got a rare insight into the daily schedule of a tech startup CEO.
[00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:57.800]   And I went through these schedules that I was re recreating from profiles.
[00:56:57.800 --> 00:57:01.360]   I was saying, look how interrupted it is.
[00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:07.800]   Jack is constantly answering questions, getting feedback, giving feedback back to people all
[00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:08.800]   day long.
[00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:10.040]   He would move from one place to the other.
[00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:11.320]   He'd sit in this open desk.
[00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:12.320]   People would come by all day long.
[00:57:12.320 --> 00:57:14.200]   I was like, there's no deep work happening there.
[00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:17.400]   And what I argued in my book was that's fine.
[00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:25.780]   For Jack Dorsey, for that job, for that person, maximizing the quality and quantity of high
[00:57:25.780 --> 00:57:31.580]   end cognitive output is not that important that if you're a CEO of a fast moving startup,
[00:57:31.580 --> 00:57:36.320]   the particular role you play that's valuable, there is a decision engine.
[00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:40.380]   The most valuable thing you can do for that company is be a source of decisions on lots
[00:57:40.380 --> 00:57:41.460]   of different things.
[00:57:41.460 --> 00:57:46.080]   And if all these decisions go through you, you can have a consistent vision applied to
[00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:47.080]   these decisions.
[00:57:47.080 --> 00:57:50.660]   So the startup evolves at this early stage in an aggressive, consistent way that aligns
[00:57:50.660 --> 00:57:53.260]   with your vision as a founder.
[00:57:53.260 --> 00:57:59.700]   So a founder of a company in these early stages doesn't need five hours of uninterrupted thinking.
[00:57:59.700 --> 00:58:04.820]   You hire programmers to do that and be very careful to not make them be on Slack all day.
[00:58:04.820 --> 00:58:08.460]   But you as the founder actually, and this is exactly what I argued in deep work, are
[00:58:08.460 --> 00:58:11.900]   most valuable if you are available.
[00:58:11.900 --> 00:58:15.260]   So all of these different action decisions come through you and the answers that come
[00:58:15.260 --> 00:58:18.900]   out are coherent and that helps the startup grow.
[00:58:18.900 --> 00:58:23.140]   So what Sam is saying is absolutely right, but it should not be generalized because for
[00:58:23.140 --> 00:58:25.340]   most people it'd be a disaster.
[00:58:25.340 --> 00:58:29.300]   For most people whose value comes not from you being the brilliant founder of a company
[00:58:29.300 --> 00:58:31.820]   that's laying out the vision on which the company is going to unfold.
[00:58:31.820 --> 00:58:37.120]   If that's not you, then you need to be producing at the height of your cognitive abilities.
[00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:39.900]   If you're writing computer code, if you're writing business strategy, if you're putting
[00:58:39.900 --> 00:58:45.540]   together consultant reports, if you're writing academic papers, your value is not maximized
[00:58:45.540 --> 00:58:48.980]   by being a consistent source of aggressive decisions.
[00:58:48.980 --> 00:58:54.140]   It's maximized by you producing really smart cognitive output and you want to reduce cognitive
[00:58:54.140 --> 00:58:59.020]   context switching to do that at the highest possible level.
[00:58:59.020 --> 00:59:00.940]   So most people aren't Jack Dorsey.
[00:59:00.940 --> 00:59:05.940]   Interestingly, after deep work came out, I got a note from one of the early funders of
[00:59:05.940 --> 00:59:11.140]   Twitter who knows Jack well and remembers him during this period.
[00:59:11.140 --> 00:59:15.820]   And he said, you're right in the sense that he'd made a lot of decisions and there's big
[00:59:15.820 --> 00:59:17.420]   parts of the day where he's very accessible.
[00:59:17.420 --> 00:59:21.660]   But he's like, you're wrong when you say that deep work was not important for him.
[00:59:21.660 --> 00:59:27.780]   Jack would also preserve periods of deep concentrated work for thinking through strategy at a higher
[00:59:27.780 --> 00:59:28.780]   level.
[00:59:28.780 --> 00:59:32.300]   So even I was being a little bit too bullish there.
[00:59:32.300 --> 00:59:34.980]   And this person said, yes, he was very accessible, but not all the time.
[00:59:34.980 --> 00:59:37.180]   And he really did prioritize deep work as well.
[00:59:37.180 --> 00:59:41.940]   So even Sam Altman's founders, yes, you want them to be decisive and responsive and being
[00:59:41.940 --> 00:59:44.340]   able to filter what's important and what's not important.
[00:59:44.340 --> 00:59:47.680]   But you should also be happy if you're Sam Altman to know that your founder has two hours
[00:59:47.680 --> 00:59:52.380]   a day where you can't find them because they're thinking really intensely and organizing their
[00:59:52.380 --> 00:59:53.380]   thoughts.
[00:59:53.380 --> 00:59:56.020]   So when they spend the rest of the day making all those decisions, they're coming from a
[00:59:56.020 --> 01:00:02.180]   place of really considered projections and theorizing and strategizing.
[01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:04.380]   And so that's my response.
[01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:06.100]   So do not take that.
[01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:10.820]   The rest of you out there who aren't Jack Dorsey, don't take that conversation as an
[01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:12.340]   excuse to, oh, I should check my email more.
[01:00:12.340 --> 01:00:13.780]   That's really going to help my career.
[01:00:13.780 --> 01:00:14.780]   All right.
[01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:19.060]   Let's see, Jesse, we got a couple of quick questions.
[01:00:19.060 --> 01:00:20.300]   I'm looking at our notes here.
[01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:21.300]   Yep.
[01:00:21.300 --> 01:00:22.620]   Got a couple of questions with fast answers.
[01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:24.500]   I'm excited about.
[01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:26.540]   Here is a question from Charlotte.
[01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:29.820]   Is there some kind of document I can find on your website to help me start using your
[01:00:29.820 --> 01:00:32.340]   quarterly weekly daily planning technique?
[01:00:32.340 --> 01:00:34.260]   Yes, it's not a document.
[01:00:34.260 --> 01:00:40.100]   It's a video on the YouTube page, youtube.com/calnewportmedia.
[01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:46.780]   Look at the core ideas playlist and the video in their title, time management.
[01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:48.740]   And I just go through that system.
[01:00:48.740 --> 01:00:53.620]   I believe also, Jesse, this is what we, Tim Ferriss played, right?
[01:00:53.620 --> 01:00:54.620]   The clip he played.
[01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:55.620]   Yeah.
[01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:56.620]   Yeah.
[01:00:56.620 --> 01:01:00.620]   So, so also, you know, Tim Ferriss on a show sometimes will collect clips from other people's
[01:01:00.620 --> 01:01:02.100]   shows and package them together.
[01:01:02.100 --> 01:01:07.260]   So last month I was involved in one of those packages and the clip that we sent him was
[01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:09.780]   the discussion of that multi-scale planning.
[01:01:09.780 --> 01:01:11.860]   So that's the best document for that right now.
[01:01:11.860 --> 01:01:16.100]   There's also timeblockplanner.com where they can, there's a video up on there too, right?
[01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:17.100]   Yeah.
[01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:18.100]   So if you want it, that's a good, good point.
[01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:22.980]   So for the, the specific piece in there of daily planning with time blocking, there's
[01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:27.960]   a pretty good video I did at timeblockplanner.com where that's just about time blocking.
[01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:32.340]   So yeah, you might watch the core ideas, time management video to get my whole system.
[01:01:32.340 --> 01:01:36.200]   And then you might also watch that time block video at timeblockplanning.com to really hone
[01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:38.220]   in on the time blocking.
[01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:41.860]   And of course, all of these issues we've talked about individually as well.
[01:01:41.860 --> 01:01:46.020]   I mean, we've done a bunch of stuff on weekly planning, a bunch of stuff on strategic planning,
[01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:51.460]   but that video is the best, best document I have right now for that planning system.
[01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:52.460]   All right.
[01:01:52.460 --> 01:01:54.340]   What's our other quick question?
[01:01:54.340 --> 01:01:55.340]   All right.
[01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:56.740]   Question from James.
[01:01:56.740 --> 01:02:01.700]   Speaking of time block, you mentioned several months ago that a revised edition of your
[01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:03.740]   time block planner was in the works.
[01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:05.780]   Do you have any updates to share with your listeners?
[01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:07.060]   Well, I do.
[01:02:07.060 --> 01:02:08.060]   Your timing is good.
[01:02:08.060 --> 01:02:11.260]   James, we're working on this as we speak.
[01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:16.820]   I have a bunch of dummy planners for the new version at my study at my house right now.
[01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:18.860]   And we've honed in on exactly that.
[01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:21.100]   We now have finalized all those details.
[01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:26.580]   Yesterday, I submitted my responses to the copy editing of the new text for the new version
[01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:27.580]   of the planner.
[01:02:27.580 --> 01:02:29.660]   So we're actually in that process right now.
[01:02:29.660 --> 01:02:35.840]   So the good news is a really cool V2 of the planner is coming together.
[01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:39.420]   Just to give you a preview of some of the things that we'll have.
[01:02:39.420 --> 01:02:45.620]   Spiral binding, completely lay flat, thicker cover, no warping issues.
[01:02:45.620 --> 01:02:48.940]   I've condensed the weekend.
[01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:52.680]   So instead of having two full double page spreads for the weekend, which kind of goes
[01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:57.320]   against my advice of don't time block the weekend, we now have a weekend page where
[01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:02.480]   one page is custom designed for looser weekend planning and the adjoining pages for the weekly
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:03.480]   plan.
[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:04.520]   This saved us a lot of pages.
[01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:07.440]   We've added a whole other month worth of weeks to the planner.
[01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:11.940]   So you're now going to get four full months worth of planning in one planner.
[01:03:11.940 --> 01:03:14.880]   Also we're updating the design interior, making it sharper.
[01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:16.820]   I updated the front matter.
[01:03:16.820 --> 01:03:20.600]   There's an author's note about what I've learned since the first planner came out and some tweaks
[01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:21.600]   to the advice.
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:22.600]   So this is the good news.
[01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:25.060]   There's a really cool V2 of this planner coming out.
[01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:29.740]   The bad news is because of supply chain issues, we're looking at late summer.
[01:03:29.740 --> 01:03:32.220]   So it's going to be a little while till this is ready.
[01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:36.720]   And again, this is just supply chain nonsense, which is afflicting everyone.
[01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:41.180]   But we have everything standing by to come out as soon as that's possible.
[01:03:41.180 --> 01:03:44.600]   So I would recommend don't wait.
[01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:48.400]   You know, if you're currently time blocking with my current planner, keep doing it.
[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:50.600]   When the new planner comes out, you can switch over to those.
[01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:54.560]   If you're thinking about time blocking, don't wait until next summer to start.
[01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:56.560]   I mean, the current planner works great.
[01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:59.600]   Learn the habit now get going and just know at some point you'll be able to upgrade that
[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:00.680]   to an even better planner.
[01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:03.220]   And some point after that, I'll probably update it again.
[01:04:03.220 --> 01:04:07.400]   As I tell people, when you're buying your first time block planner, it's less about
[01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:09.400]   this one physical product you have.
[01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:11.880]   It's more about the system you're buying into.
[01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:15.720]   If you go through these, you'll keep buying new planners over the years, the planners
[01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:17.320]   physical formal update.
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:19.340]   It's the commitment to time blocking that really matters.
[01:04:19.340 --> 01:04:21.480]   So cool stuff is coming, but don't wait for it.
[01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:22.960]   If you're thinking about doing it now.
[01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:30.120]   And as we mentioned the last question, timeblockplanner.com explains it explains the whole thing.
[01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:31.120]   Here's the planner.
[01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:32.120]   Here's how it works.
[01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:33.120]   Here's a video that explains the system.
[01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:37.280]   So go there to learn more about my time block planner.
[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:41.640]   All right, just I want to do a case study.
[01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:46.480]   I like doing case studies so we can see some of my ideas and action in the real world.
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:51.280]   So I have a written case study here from Liz.
[01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:55.480]   And so I'm going to read what Liz sent me.
[01:04:55.480 --> 01:05:01.440]   Thanks to your books and podcast, I doubled my income while cutting my hours in half.
[01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:04.200]   I am a freelance copywriter working in the advertising space.
[01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:08.920]   I came up through the ranks working the 60 plus hour weeks that advertising is known
[01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:09.920]   for.
[01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:13.020]   But along the way, I created some commercials and campaigns that got national recognition
[01:05:13.020 --> 01:05:18.160]   and earned me enough career capital to go freelance after the birth of my first son.
[01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:22.960]   That career capital was enough to get me clients as a new freelancer, but not enough to get
[01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:25.000]   me the lifestyle I was hoping for.
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.460]   I was still working crazy hours and feeling burnt out.
[01:05:28.460 --> 01:05:31.880]   This is where your ideas changed my life.
[01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:38.720]   I began implementing office hours with my clients via Slack and devoting large chunks
[01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:41.280]   of my day to doing uninterrupted writing.
[01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:46.200]   This immediately increased my quality of work while cutting my hours by at least 30%, if
[01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:48.080]   not more.
[01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:51.440]   My clients didn't bat an eye because I was still agreeing to use their preferred method
[01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:55.920]   of communication, which was Slack, and I was responding promptly to them during my next
[01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:56.920]   office hour.
[01:05:56.920 --> 01:06:03.000]   It also didn't hurt that I framed those office hours as a way to maximize their money, because
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:07.120]   at the end of the day, every client will acknowledge they aren't paying me to talk to them on Slack,
[01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:10.480]   they're paying me to write good ads.
[01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:15.600]   I also quit all forms of social media, which has given me so much more mental clarity than
[01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:19.480]   I ever could have imagined and I think has increased my overall productivity just as
[01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:23.080]   much as time blocking and office hours.
[01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:26.840]   Since going freelance, I have raised my rates twice without losing any clients.
[01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:32.120]   Right now I am on retainer with two different agencies for a total of 40 hours.
[01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:36.080]   But since implementing your practices has allowed me to work so much, much quicker,
[01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:39.960]   I often complete my work in half that time.
[01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:45.080]   I spend this extra time picking up odd freelance jobs for extra income, reading books, or going
[01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:47.400]   on phone-free walks.
[01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:51.780]   I also stop work at 3pm every day to be with my older son when he gets home from preschool.
[01:06:51.780 --> 01:06:55.280]   It's exactly the lifestyle I had imagined with going freelance and I couldn't have done
[01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:56.720]   it without you.
[01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:57.720]   Thank you.
[01:06:57.720 --> 01:07:05.200]   So, Jesse, I love this case study for multiple reasons, because it has multiple ideas we
[01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:07.960]   talk about working.
[01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:11.320]   And so I'm looking at my notes here about this case study.
[01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:15.680]   First, is this the career capital framework?
[01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:19.440]   I think that was absolutely the right framework for Liz to think about her career.
[01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:25.800]   So her ultimate goal was to be freelance with flexible hours with good compensation, but
[01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:28.100]   I'm done with work by 3.
[01:07:28.100 --> 01:07:32.120]   And so she got enough career capital to go freelance by being so good she couldn't be
[01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:33.120]   ignored.
[01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:36.480]   She had some ad campaigns that won awards, got national recognition, but it wasn't yet
[01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:39.300]   enough to get her to the schedule she wanted.
[01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:43.160]   And so there she threw in, she had the capital for it, then she threw in tactics.
[01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:48.720]   So it's this combination of career capital and tactics aimed at the particular vision
[01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:49.720]   you have of your lifestyle.
[01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:52.440]   So she put that together really nicely.
[01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:54.980]   If she had only done one and not the other, it would have been a problem.
[01:07:54.980 --> 01:08:00.700]   If she had only focused on career capital, as we saw, she was still crazy busy even after
[01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:02.280]   she was nationally recognized.
[01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:07.520]   And if she had only focused on strategies, she would have had trouble because if she
[01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:11.400]   wasn't doing work that was being nationally recognized, no one cares what your time management
[01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:13.200]   strategies are, they're not going to hire you.
[01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:16.720]   And so I thought that combination was very powerful.
[01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:22.680]   Second thing I noticed here was this notion, and I talk about this in a world without email,
[01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:27.040]   people are afraid of if I put structure to communication with clients, they will not
[01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:28.040]   tolerate it.
[01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:29.600]   They demand accessibility.
[01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:31.920]   I always argue that's not true.
[01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:33.980]   Clients don't need accessibility.
[01:08:33.980 --> 01:08:36.160]   They need consistency.
[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:41.300]   They need to understand if I need to contact you, how does that work?
[01:08:41.300 --> 01:08:45.120]   And if they understand how that works, the accessibility is not so important.
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:47.280]   Accessibility is only important if there's no other system.
[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:50.760]   So if it's just, I don't know, we just slack back and forth, then I really need you to
[01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:54.320]   answer my slack right away because otherwise I have to like sit around and wait and I don't
[01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:55.760]   know what I'm going to get an answer.
[01:08:55.760 --> 01:09:00.200]   But if you have something that's consistent and clear, like office hours every day, that's
[01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:02.380]   when I will answer you.
[01:09:02.380 --> 01:09:07.280]   That's completely fine because what you're providing for the client is clarity.
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:08.280]   Oh, okay.
[01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:13.840]   So Liz, I can't just slack her right now, but at three o'clock or two o'clock or whatever,
[01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:14.960]   I can and she'll answer.
[01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:17.760]   Or I can send this to her now and expect an answer at two.
[01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:18.760]   Great.
[01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:19.760]   I have clarity here.
[01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:20.760]   It's consistent and clear.
[01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:21.760]   I don't have to worry about this.
[01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:23.360]   Let me move on with all these other things I care about in my life.
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:25.520]   I don't care that she answers my slack right now.
[01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:29.120]   I care that I know and can trust when she will.
[01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:32.480]   And so this clarity over accessibility is a theme that comes up often.
[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:34.040]   Liz lived that out.
[01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:35.040]   Her clients were fine.
[01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:36.040]   Yeah, okay.
[01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:37.040]   I can wait until office hours.
[01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:38.040]   I don't care.
[01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:39.040]   I don't care.
[01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:40.040]   It's great.
[01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:41.040]   Office hours.
[01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:42.040]   Good.
[01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:43.040]   Let's roll.
[01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:44.040]   And so she lost no clients doing that.
[01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:46.340]   I also like she quit social media.
[01:09:46.340 --> 01:09:49.520]   We often see this as two different magisteria.
[01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:52.480]   There's your personal life being on your phone.
[01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:54.760]   This is like digital minimalism applies.
[01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:57.200]   And then you have your professional life.
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:09:58.520]   It's about email and slack.
[01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:02.040]   And that's where books like Deep Work and A World Without Email apply.
[01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:03.040]   They're not so separate.
[01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:08.800]   And as Liz learned, especially as a freelancer, what she was looking at at her phone, the
[01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:14.240]   distraction that engendered, though not coming from clients and not directly related to work,
[01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:16.680]   distracted her from her work.
[01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:18.520]   And it was taking her much more time to get things done.
[01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:21.500]   So when she got rid of social media, she's locked in.
[01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:22.500]   When I'm working, I'm working.
[01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:23.920]   And you don't have this back and forth.
[01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:29.440]   I think that's a big part of my own success is my lack of social media use.
[01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:30.440]   Means when I'm working, I'm working.
[01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:36.640]   This is why a lot gets produced, even though I work a very standard number of hours.
[01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:40.080]   And the final thing I'll say I really liked about Liz's case study is that it is lifestyle
[01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:43.400]   centric career planning.
[01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:46.280]   She was a copywriter working big hours.
[01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:49.400]   Instead of just saying, I just want to quit or I want to make more money, she said, what
[01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:51.600]   lifestyle do I want?
[01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:52.960]   She wanted autonomy.
[01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:58.340]   She wanted to be done by work by three to spend time with her kids and have similar
[01:10:58.340 --> 01:11:02.040]   compensation to what she was getting for working 60 plus hours.
[01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:05.520]   And there wasn't a switch she could flick that meant tomorrow I'm going to have that.
[01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:08.560]   But she knew what she was working backwards from.
[01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:10.080]   And she change after change.
[01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:11.160]   Let me get really good.
[01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:12.160]   So good I can't ignore you.
[01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:13.160]   Let me go freelance.
[01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:14.520]   Now that I'm freelance, let me throw in tactics.
[01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:16.000]   Let me tame the way I deal with clients.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:17.000]   Let me work with distractions.
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.840]   Work, work, work, work all towards this eventual goal.
[01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:20.840]   And then she hit it.
[01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:24.440]   So she started with the lifestyle and that drove all of these decisions.
[01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:25.440]   And she finally got there.
[01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:28.980]   And as she says, it's exactly the lifestyle she had imagined.
[01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:32.360]   So Liz, I really like that case study.
[01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:35.780]   This is my advice and action for crafting a deep life.
[01:11:35.780 --> 01:11:37.340]   Making double the money to.
[01:11:37.340 --> 01:11:38.500]   Oh yeah.
[01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:39.500]   So I had that wrong.
[01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:40.500]   Yeah.
[01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:41.500]   She's doubling.
[01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:42.500]   Yeah.
[01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:45.220]   She's raised her weight rates twice and she's on a 40 hour a week retainer.
[01:11:45.220 --> 01:11:46.220]   Yeah.
[01:11:46.220 --> 01:11:47.220]   So she's probably making more bank.
[01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:48.220]   Yeah.
[01:11:48.220 --> 01:11:49.220]   Than she was doing 60 hour weeks.
[01:11:49.220 --> 01:11:50.220]   I like it.
[01:11:50.220 --> 01:11:51.220]   Yeah.
[01:11:51.220 --> 01:11:52.220]   All right.
[01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:53.220]   Well, good work, Liz.
[01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:55.220]   All right.
[01:11:55.220 --> 01:11:58.940]   Well, we have one more segment in the show.
[01:11:58.940 --> 01:12:03.700]   There is some recent news about teenagers and smartphones, including a story that might
[01:12:03.700 --> 01:12:05.540]   surprise you.
[01:12:05.540 --> 01:12:09.580]   Before we get there, let me just briefly mention another sponsor that makes the podcast possible.
[01:12:09.580 --> 01:12:15.540]   That's our long time friends and our longtime partners at Blinkist.
[01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:21.820]   As I often say on this show, in our current culture, ideas are power.
[01:12:21.820 --> 01:12:24.300]   The best source of ideas are books.
[01:12:24.300 --> 01:12:28.780]   This is where you get to see the end result of years of years of careful thinking and
[01:12:28.780 --> 01:12:34.940]   experience and careful crafting of the ideas into a really clear, legible, written form.
[01:12:34.940 --> 01:12:37.340]   Books are the best source of ideas.
[01:12:37.340 --> 01:12:41.740]   The problem is figuring out which books to read and which books to pass on.
[01:12:41.740 --> 01:12:44.740]   This is where Blinkist enters the picture.
[01:12:44.740 --> 01:12:52.980]   They offer 15 minute text and audio explainers called Blinks of over 5000 nonfiction book
[01:12:52.980 --> 01:12:58.000]   titles spread through 27 different categories.
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:01.780]   So now if you're interested in a particular book, you can just listen to while you're
[01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:06.060]   doing the dishes or read real quick on your phone a 15 minute summary of that book.
[01:13:06.060 --> 01:13:09.740]   Get the main ideas, get the lay of the land and say, OK, is this really what I'm looking
[01:13:09.740 --> 01:13:11.180]   for or not?
[01:13:11.180 --> 01:13:13.380]   If not, hey, I got some good knowledge out of this.
[01:13:13.380 --> 01:13:14.380]   Move on.
[01:13:14.380 --> 01:13:16.980]   Now I know this is the book I should buy.
[01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:20.940]   I use Blinkist to triage my book buying decisions.
[01:13:20.940 --> 01:13:24.740]   And not only does it help me not waste time on books I shouldn't read, I actually get
[01:13:24.740 --> 01:13:28.900]   a lot of use out of what I learned from those 15 minute blinks.
[01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:33.740]   You'd be surprised by how often I say I didn't end up reading that book, but I got a term
[01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:37.660]   and a definition and a couple of theories out of that which I'm actually going to be
[01:13:37.660 --> 01:13:38.820]   able to use.
[01:13:38.820 --> 01:13:40.700]   And so you learn from the blinks themselves.
[01:13:40.700 --> 01:13:43.500]   I'm really, really big believer of it.
[01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:47.620]   They have now also added something called short cast.
[01:13:47.620 --> 01:13:54.700]   Which provide 15 minute summaries of what was discussed on popular long form podcasts.
[01:13:54.700 --> 01:13:59.060]   You can you can begin to extract information from those as well without having to listen
[01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:03.260]   to everything all the way through.
[01:14:03.260 --> 01:14:05.680]   So right now Blinkist has a special offer just for our audience.
[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:11.300]   If you go to Blinkist.com/deep to start your free seven day trial, you will get 25 percent

[01:14:17.540 --> 01:14:21.820]   Blinkist.com/deep to get 25 percent off on a seven day free trial.
[01:14:21.820 --> 01:14:25.620]   Blinkist.com/deep.
[01:14:25.620 --> 01:14:32.300]   I also want to talk about our longtime partners at ExpressVPN.
[01:14:32.300 --> 01:14:36.020]   Using the internet without ExpressVPN is like checking in your baggage at the airport without
[01:14:36.020 --> 01:14:37.020]   a lock.
[01:14:37.020 --> 01:14:43.340]   You think your stuff is private, but you never know who's going to go through all of that
[01:14:43.340 --> 01:14:45.500]   embarrassing stuff you have hidden in there.
[01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:48.660]   Well, this is what happens when you use the internet.
[01:14:48.660 --> 01:14:49.660]   You think it's private.
[01:14:49.660 --> 01:14:52.060]   Hey, no one's looking over my shoulder.
[01:14:52.060 --> 01:14:57.680]   So you know, I'm going to whatever embarrassing website or shopping or what have you.
[01:14:57.680 --> 01:15:02.340]   But your internet service provider is looking at this like, oh, like, what's a what's Cal
[01:15:02.340 --> 01:15:03.340]   up to?
[01:15:03.340 --> 01:15:04.580]   Let me keep track of what he's doing.
[01:15:04.580 --> 01:15:05.580]   You know why?
[01:15:05.580 --> 01:15:08.660]   Because you give that information to advertisers who say, oh, like, Cal is like really into
[01:15:08.660 --> 01:15:09.660]   this weird thing.
[01:15:09.660 --> 01:15:11.520]   Now we can sell him ads.
[01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:13.780]   People watch what you do on the Internet.
[01:15:13.780 --> 01:15:17.900]   A VPN prevents them from doing so.
[01:15:17.900 --> 01:15:23.100]   When you use a VPN, you create an encrypted connection to a VPN server.
[01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:26.900]   All your internet service provider or anyone sniffing the packets out of the radio waves
[01:15:26.900 --> 01:15:31.380]   in the air around you, all they learn is that you are sending encrypted packets to a VPN
[01:15:31.380 --> 01:15:32.380]   server.
[01:15:32.380 --> 01:15:36.020]   The VPN server then unencrypts those packets and sends them along to who you really want
[01:15:36.020 --> 01:15:41.340]   to talk to the website you really want to go to the streaming movie you really wanted
[01:15:41.340 --> 01:15:42.340]   to watch.
[01:15:42.340 --> 01:15:44.900]   And when those packets come back to the VPN server, they re encrypt them and send them
[01:15:44.900 --> 01:15:45.980]   back to you.
[01:15:45.980 --> 01:15:50.540]   So everyone who's trying to observe what you're doing finds out nothing other than the fact
[01:15:50.540 --> 01:15:53.340]   that you are communicating to the Internet.
[01:15:53.340 --> 01:15:55.380]   Through a VPN server.
[01:15:55.380 --> 01:15:58.620]   You have to use a VPN, especially when you're traveling.
[01:15:58.620 --> 01:16:03.380]   And if you're gonna use a VPN ExpressVPN is the one I like.
[01:16:03.380 --> 01:16:07.420]   They have more servers all around the world.
[01:16:07.420 --> 01:16:11.260]   So you're often you're gonna be able to find a server near wherever you happen to be.
[01:16:11.260 --> 01:16:14.940]   They have a lot of bandwidth, it's very fast, and the software is really easy to use.
[01:16:14.940 --> 01:16:18.780]   You turn it on on whatever device you're using with just a click, and then it's seamless,
[01:16:18.780 --> 01:16:20.380]   and you use the Internet like normal.
[01:16:20.380 --> 01:16:25.160]   It handles all of the tunneling to the VPN server on your behalf.
[01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:29.540]   So ExpressVPN is how I protect my internet traffic.
[01:16:29.540 --> 01:16:31.620]   And it's what I recommend for you as well.
[01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:37.300]   Secure your online activity by visiting ExpressVPN.com/deep today.
[01:16:37.300 --> 01:16:45.100]   That's e x p r e s s vpn.com/deep and you will get three extra months free when you
[01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:48.260]   go to ExpressVPN.com/deep.
[01:16:48.260 --> 01:16:49.820]   So don't forget that slash deep.
[01:16:49.820 --> 01:16:52.820]   That's where you get the free time.
[01:16:52.820 --> 01:16:56.700]   All right, Jesse, got one more segment today.
[01:16:56.700 --> 01:17:00.340]   A quick news reaction segment.
[01:17:00.340 --> 01:17:04.220]   I want to start with this article from the Wall Street Journal.
[01:17:04.220 --> 01:17:06.940]   This was published on November 5th.
[01:17:06.940 --> 01:17:08.780]   It's written by Julie Jargon.
[01:17:08.780 --> 01:17:11.980]   She's an awesome name, by the way.
[01:17:11.980 --> 01:17:16.540]   The name of this article is "This school took away smartphones.
[01:17:16.540 --> 01:17:18.580]   The kids don't mind."
[01:17:18.580 --> 01:17:21.540]   It's a very interesting natural experiment.
[01:17:21.540 --> 01:17:24.060]   If you're watching on YouTube, I have this up on the screen, but I'll narrate what I'm
[01:17:24.060 --> 01:17:25.380]   doing here.
[01:17:25.380 --> 01:17:26.380]   Here's the setting.
[01:17:26.380 --> 01:17:28.500]   There's a school called Buxton.
[01:17:28.500 --> 01:17:35.380]   It's a very small 57 student high school in Williamstown in Northwest Massachusetts.
[01:17:35.380 --> 01:17:39.360]   It's a small school that had prided itself on its sense of community.
[01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:46.120]   They began to worry, the students and the staff began to worry about the impact of phones
[01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:48.280]   on their students.
[01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:53.460]   They saw their students retreating more to their screens, not socializing.
[01:17:53.460 --> 01:17:56.780]   The brief closure for the pandemic seemed to make this even worse.
[01:17:56.780 --> 01:18:01.900]   They had a couple really negative events happen where someone was live streaming a fight and
[01:18:01.900 --> 01:18:04.100]   they said, "Okay, enough.
[01:18:04.100 --> 01:18:06.140]   We are going to take the phones away."
[01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:08.780]   Now keep in mind, this is a boarding school.
[01:18:08.780 --> 01:18:10.140]   These students live at the school.
[01:18:10.140 --> 01:18:14.580]   When we say we're going to take their phones away, they don't mean no phones in class.
[01:18:14.580 --> 01:18:19.060]   It's no, your phones are back at your house in California.
[01:18:19.060 --> 01:18:21.680]   You don't have a phone with you where you live on this campus.
[01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:24.100]   You literally don't have a phone with you.
[01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:28.620]   As the article says, many students thought that the school wouldn't actually do that,
[01:18:28.620 --> 01:18:29.620]   but it happened.
[01:18:29.620 --> 01:18:32.620]   All right, so let's see what happened.
[01:18:32.620 --> 01:18:38.600]   This fall, students were not permitted to have smartphones on campus of the Buxton schools
[01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:44.680]   and the teachers also agreed not to use their smartphones while in the classroom or while
[01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:46.480]   on campus.
[01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:53.040]   What the school did instead is they gave all the students light phones, LIGHT phones.
[01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:56.820]   And if you're watching on YouTube, I'll show you a picture of a light phone right here.
[01:18:56.820 --> 01:18:57.820]   So that's what it looks like.
[01:18:57.820 --> 01:19:00.420]   I wrote about these in Digital Minimalism.
[01:19:00.420 --> 01:19:04.220]   It's just a very simple phone, well-designed, but very simple phone.
[01:19:04.220 --> 01:19:09.220]   You can call and you can do simple text messaging and that's it.
[01:19:09.220 --> 01:19:13.540]   No internet browser, no social media, no YouTube.
[01:19:13.540 --> 01:19:16.960]   All right, so now it's been two months.
[01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:18.980]   So we want to check in on what happened at the schools.
[01:19:18.980 --> 01:19:20.580]   November, they tried this this fall.
[01:19:20.580 --> 01:19:24.560]   And you should know, I should emphasize this, not surprisingly, when they made this announcement
[01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:28.500]   at the beginning of the school year, it resulted in chaos.
[01:19:28.500 --> 01:19:31.500]   The principal said everyone was crying.
[01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:33.180]   Kids were yelling at us.
[01:19:33.180 --> 01:19:35.060]   Student feedback was really mixed.
[01:19:35.060 --> 01:19:39.780]   So now that we're two months into this experiment, let us see what happened.
[01:19:39.780 --> 01:19:41.820]   I'll scroll down here a little bit.
[01:19:41.820 --> 01:19:47.320]   All right, so I numbered a few observations about what happened, reported in this article.
[01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:53.060]   Number one, students have gotten used to not being glued to their screens all the time.
[01:19:53.060 --> 01:19:55.880]   The one student they profiled said it's nice to see other students walking around campus
[01:19:55.880 --> 01:19:58.180]   without looking down at their phones.
[01:19:58.180 --> 01:20:04.580]   Number two, here's a senior at the school says it has been a relief.
[01:20:04.580 --> 01:20:08.140]   Now she can go on strolls or study without being bombarded by notifications and the pressure
[01:20:08.140 --> 01:20:10.660]   to respond to text.
[01:20:10.660 --> 01:20:16.260]   Number three, the teachers say they had to adjust and they realized this adjustment has
[01:20:16.260 --> 01:20:17.260]   been for the better.
[01:20:17.260 --> 01:20:19.820]   So here's a math teacher talking.
[01:20:19.820 --> 01:20:24.180]   I used to have my smartphone on my desk when I was teaching and there were moments of checking
[01:20:24.180 --> 01:20:25.520]   in with the outside world.
[01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:28.980]   Now there's nothing that brings me out of the classroom.
[01:20:28.980 --> 01:20:37.440]   Number four, the first assessment to the school conducted about how this experiment was going
[01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:43.820]   led to them discovering that the ban hasn't been as bad as the students feared.
[01:20:43.820 --> 01:20:49.760]   Teachers are reporting that students are more engaged in class.
[01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:57.300]   Number five, there's a quote here from Anne Lemke who wrote Dopamine Nation.
[01:20:57.300 --> 01:20:59.840]   She's been on a lot of the big podcasts.
[01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:01.360]   You maybe have heard her on Huberman.
[01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:03.540]   I think she went on Joe Rogan.
[01:21:03.540 --> 01:21:09.000]   She has been encouraging for a long time that schools adopt similar bans.
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:12.200]   It is unrealistic and unfair to expect students to police themselves without help.
[01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:16.520]   And so I put that as number five because I think it sums up what we're seeing at the
[01:21:16.520 --> 01:21:20.900]   Buxton School in Williamstown, Massachusetts.
[01:21:20.900 --> 01:21:27.740]   When you remove phones from these teenagers' lives, they get better in almost all the ways.
[01:21:27.740 --> 01:21:32.780]   If you expect the teenagers to have to do this unilaterally, good luck.
[01:21:32.780 --> 01:21:37.120]   You are in an unstable suboptimal Nash equilibrium when we're talking about the social dynamics
[01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:38.120]   of a high school.
[01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:43.940]   I can't be the only kid who is not using my phone, who's not on whatever social media
[01:21:43.940 --> 01:21:45.940]   kids use these days, who's not on the group text.
[01:21:45.940 --> 01:21:50.080]   If I'm the only kid not using this, there's huge negative externalities because that applies
[01:21:50.080 --> 01:21:51.460]   to each individual student.
[01:21:51.460 --> 01:21:56.120]   The equilibrium here in a game theoretic sense is we all just have to keep using this.
[01:21:56.120 --> 01:22:00.980]   But if the school comes in and say none of you can use it, they're free.
[01:22:00.980 --> 01:22:04.500]   And they can all exist in a state that has all of these other advantages.
[01:22:04.500 --> 01:22:09.880]   Now I definitely picked up this vibe three years ago when I was on the road doing the
[01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:12.780]   book tour for digital minimalism.
[01:22:12.780 --> 01:22:16.100]   Time and again I would hear from teenagers or from the parents of teenagers who are talking
[01:22:16.100 --> 01:22:19.140]   about there is this exhaustion with all these tools.
[01:22:19.140 --> 01:22:22.820]   15 year olds, 16 year olds, 17 year olds, 18 year olds, they're tired of it.
[01:22:22.820 --> 01:22:24.060]   They're tired of having to be on Snapchat.
[01:22:24.060 --> 01:22:26.180]   That was the thing back then.
[01:22:26.180 --> 01:22:30.780]   And all these group texts, the exhaustion of trying to keep up with what's going on,
[01:22:30.780 --> 01:22:34.060]   having to TikTok and keep track of the, you know, did you see this TikTok?
[01:22:34.060 --> 01:22:35.900]   What's happening with this TikTok I was doing there?
[01:22:35.900 --> 01:22:36.900]   This is exhausting to them.
[01:22:36.900 --> 01:22:39.420]   They feel like they're trapped.
[01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:42.900]   So kids are very culturally savvy.
[01:22:42.900 --> 01:22:43.900]   They're very attuned.
[01:22:43.900 --> 01:22:49.020]   And so they're no fans of the titans of Silicon Valley.
[01:22:49.020 --> 01:22:54.340]   They don't love this idea that their time is essentially monetizing Mark Zuckerberg's
[01:22:54.340 --> 01:22:57.900]   fortune, that their time is monetizing Elon Musk.
[01:22:57.900 --> 01:23:00.060]   It's not like they're big fans of these companies.
[01:23:00.060 --> 01:23:06.980]   So we have this perfect mixture for trying to break free from this situation of teenage
[01:23:06.980 --> 01:23:10.660]   phone and social media overuse, which is they're exhausted by it and they don't even really
[01:23:10.660 --> 01:23:15.100]   like the companies in the first place, but they're trapped because it's hard to unilaterally
[01:23:15.100 --> 01:23:16.220]   move out of this by yourself.
[01:23:16.220 --> 01:23:20.900]   So we need to find ways like the Buxton School did to normalize this.
[01:23:20.900 --> 01:23:24.460]   We cannot take so seriously the argument of like, well, everyone else is doing it.
[01:23:24.460 --> 01:23:26.260]   Kids these days, what can we do?
[01:23:26.260 --> 01:23:27.620]   What can we do?
[01:23:27.620 --> 01:23:30.420]   We can actually step in and say, let me make your life easier.
[01:23:30.420 --> 01:23:33.180]   And there might be crying and yelling up front.
[01:23:33.180 --> 01:23:35.980]   We're not using phones in this house until you go to college.
[01:23:35.980 --> 01:23:37.540]   We're not using phones at the school at all.
[01:23:37.540 --> 01:23:39.780]   You can't even bring it into the school.
[01:23:39.780 --> 01:23:41.140]   We have a whole wall of white phones.
[01:23:41.140 --> 01:23:43.860]   If you need to call your parents, don't worry about it.
[01:23:43.860 --> 01:23:45.940]   The parents have to get more involved here.
[01:23:45.940 --> 01:23:47.940]   The educators have to get more involved here.
[01:23:47.940 --> 01:23:52.780]   So I want to jump to one other article to help motivate this.
[01:23:52.780 --> 01:23:55.220]   Why this is so important.
[01:23:55.220 --> 01:23:58.540]   This is a new paper, and I'll just briefly mention the abstract here.
[01:23:58.540 --> 01:24:01.900]   This is a economist, Elaine Gao.
[01:24:01.900 --> 01:24:03.540]   It's a working paper that she wrote.
[01:24:03.540 --> 01:24:05.220]   So this is not yet peer reviewed.
[01:24:05.220 --> 01:24:07.940]   It's a job market paper.
[01:24:07.940 --> 01:24:14.460]   So it's a work she wrote as part of her process of applying for professorships.
[01:24:14.460 --> 01:24:20.060]   And the article is called Social Media and Teenage Mental Health Quasi-Experimental Evidence.
[01:24:20.060 --> 01:24:23.460]   So Elaine did a really cool study here.
[01:24:23.460 --> 01:24:27.300]   She correlated in British Columbia, particular towns, looking at a couple different towns
[01:24:27.300 --> 01:24:31.700]   in British Columbia, a couple of different pieces of evidence to try to get at the impact
[01:24:31.700 --> 01:24:33.860]   of social media on teenagers.
[01:24:33.860 --> 01:24:38.260]   Now, the hard part about doing these type of studies, of course, is confounding factors.
[01:24:38.260 --> 01:24:44.300]   This has been the big issue with these giant social science databases where you have all
[01:24:44.300 --> 01:24:47.820]   this information, demographic and answers to questions about mental health from a lot
[01:24:47.820 --> 01:24:48.820]   of different kids.
[01:24:48.820 --> 01:24:51.100]   You try to go through and find these correlations.
[01:24:51.100 --> 01:24:54.420]   I wrote a New Yorker piece about this a year or two ago.
[01:24:54.420 --> 01:24:55.420]   It's complicated.
[01:24:55.420 --> 01:24:58.740]   If you're just trying to find correlations, like the people who said yes to social media
[01:24:58.740 --> 01:25:04.700]   are also more likely to say yes to having issues with mental health is a lot of confounding
[01:25:04.700 --> 01:25:06.140]   variables.
[01:25:06.140 --> 01:25:09.580]   And so there's more effort in the field now to find ways to pull apart these variables
[01:25:09.580 --> 01:25:15.100]   and get a cleaner look at we isolate everything but social media in a way that lets us see
[01:25:15.100 --> 01:25:19.100]   more clearly what his impact is free from confounding variables.
[01:25:19.100 --> 01:25:20.100]   OK.
[01:25:20.100 --> 01:25:22.580]   Elaine found a way to do this.
[01:25:22.580 --> 01:25:28.900]   So what she was looking at was the arrival of high speed wireless Internet in different
[01:25:28.900 --> 01:25:34.260]   neighborhoods of this region in British Columbia.
[01:25:34.260 --> 01:25:39.220]   Because she had shown it's easy to see that when high speed wireless Internet shows up,
[01:25:39.220 --> 01:25:40.860]   social media use becomes much higher in those areas.
[01:25:40.860 --> 01:25:41.860]   All right.
[01:25:41.860 --> 01:25:43.140]   That's an easy mechanistic explanation.
[01:25:43.140 --> 01:25:46.700]   If I have high speed wireless Internet, I could use social media on my phone.
[01:25:46.700 --> 01:25:48.180]   There's gonna be a lot more social media use.
[01:25:48.180 --> 01:25:52.160]   So she could look at the arrival of high speed Internet in these neighborhoods and basically
[01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:57.940]   have that be a pretty good proxy for the arrival of heavy social media use.
[01:25:57.940 --> 01:26:04.220]   She then used 20 years of student records from these neighborhoods to get at specifically
[01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:07.220]   student mental health issues.
[01:26:07.220 --> 01:26:11.420]   So now she could look at in these different areas what was happening with student social
[01:26:11.420 --> 01:26:16.980]   mental health and what was happening with high speed Internet arriving or not.
[01:26:16.980 --> 01:26:19.020]   So as a proxy for social media.
[01:26:19.020 --> 01:26:20.380]   All right.
[01:26:20.380 --> 01:26:21.740]   So she built a complicated model.
[01:26:21.740 --> 01:26:24.100]   It's called a triple difference model.
[01:26:24.100 --> 01:26:28.340]   And here's what she found.
[01:26:28.340 --> 01:26:30.660]   Estimates indicate, I'll highlight this here.
[01:26:30.660 --> 01:26:35.920]   Estimates indicate high speed wireless Internet significantly increased teen girls severe
[01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:43.820]   mental health diagnoses by 90% relative to teen boys over the period when social media
[01:26:43.820 --> 01:26:46.660]   became dominant in teenage Internet use.
[01:26:46.660 --> 01:26:49.300]   I find similar effects across all subgroups.
[01:26:49.300 --> 01:26:54.540]   But applying the same strategy, I find no impacts for placebo health conditions.
[01:26:54.540 --> 01:26:57.140]   And the final check is really important.
[01:26:57.140 --> 01:27:01.300]   You say, let's look at other types of conditions and make sure that we don't see some correlation
[01:27:01.300 --> 01:27:04.020]   that when high speed Internet came that also got worse.
[01:27:04.020 --> 01:27:07.120]   That might point to some sort of other confounding factors like no, no.
[01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:12.100]   When high speed Internet arrived, the main thing that got worse in the student health
[01:27:12.100 --> 01:27:13.940]   records was mental health.
[01:27:13.940 --> 01:27:16.540]   And it was mainly in teen girls.
[01:27:16.540 --> 01:27:20.900]   This tracks completely with the way that John Haidt, for example, summarizes the current
[01:27:20.900 --> 01:27:26.780]   social psychology data on this heavy social media use with teenage girls has a strong,
[01:27:26.780 --> 01:27:28.460]   strong signal in that data.
[01:27:28.460 --> 01:27:32.020]   This is coming at this question from a completely different angle with a quasi experimental
[01:27:32.020 --> 01:27:35.180]   design finding the exact same thing.
[01:27:35.180 --> 01:27:38.460]   But as I always say, forget the data.
[01:27:38.460 --> 01:27:40.580]   Talk to a teenage girl.
[01:27:40.580 --> 01:27:48.680]   We are not trying to isolate a subtle correlation between there's a dioxin chemical in the water
[01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:53.080]   supply here that's creating a 5 percent increase in cancer rates where you really can't figure
[01:27:53.080 --> 01:27:55.200]   out this connection unless you get the data just right.
[01:27:55.200 --> 01:27:57.500]   You can just talk to these people.
[01:27:57.500 --> 01:28:00.920]   Teenage girls, especially heavy social media users, will tell you this thing has taken
[01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:01.920]   over my life.
[01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:03.540]   It's an incredible source of anxiety.
[01:28:03.540 --> 01:28:04.860]   It's sucked in all of my attention.
[01:28:04.860 --> 01:28:05.860]   I can't sleep.
[01:28:05.860 --> 01:28:07.120]   This is all I'm doing.
[01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:09.560]   They will just tell you directly that this is a problem.
[01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:13.580]   So we shouldn't be surprised that as we design these good studies, we find these impacts
[01:28:13.580 --> 01:28:14.580]   again and again.
[01:28:14.580 --> 01:28:16.940]   But I point this out.
[01:28:16.940 --> 01:28:22.200]   One more arrow pointing towards the same conclusion that especially for young girls, social media
[01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:25.900]   use is damaging to their mental health.
[01:28:25.900 --> 01:28:29.380]   I point this out because of the article I talked to you before.
[01:28:29.380 --> 01:28:31.280]   It's a call to action.
[01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:32.620]   We can take action.
[01:28:32.620 --> 01:28:35.860]   We cannot just say kids these days will be kids.
[01:28:35.860 --> 01:28:39.680]   I listened to rock and roll and my parents didn't like it.
[01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:41.040]   This is different.
[01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:46.380]   Rock and roll did not send you to the hospital for self-harm at a unprecedentedly high rate.
[01:28:46.380 --> 01:28:53.200]   Rock and roll did not lead to you having a huge generational spike in mental health disorders.
[01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:59.060]   This is a small number of companies in the pursuit of profits damaging the psychology
[01:28:59.060 --> 01:29:01.080]   of a big segment of American youth.
[01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:03.680]   So I like that Buxton School example.
[01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:06.520]   We should get more involved and we should be more willing to have kids as happened in
[01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:11.480]   Buxton School, cry, scream and yell at us because it was two weeks later that those
[01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:15.040]   kids were all reporting, man, my life is a lot better.
[01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:17.560]   All right, Jesse, it's a long one.
[01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:21.280]   I think that's all we got the energy for today.
[01:29:21.280 --> 01:29:23.720]   So let's wrap things up.
[01:29:23.720 --> 01:29:27.200]   Thank you everyone who sent in your questions and your case studies and your live calls.
[01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:28.960]   Man, there's so much going on.
[01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:31.320]   Thank you also people who sent in these interesting articles.
[01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:33.960]   I love your links and pointers.
[01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:36.200]   Send those in the interesting@calnewport.com.
[01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:39.840]   I'll be back next week with a new full length episode of the show.
[01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:42.160]   And until then, as always, stay deep.
