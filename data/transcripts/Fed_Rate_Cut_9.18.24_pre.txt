[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.800]   Hello, everybody. It's Sam from the Financial Samurai Podcast, where I try to help you achieve
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:18.840]   financial freedom sooner rather than later. The Federal Reserve has finally cut interest
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:26.440]   rates by 50 basis points, not 25 basis points, and this is the first rate cut since 2020.
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:33.820]   The new interest rate target is 4.75% to 5%, and the dot plot signals interest rates will
[00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:42.720]   be down to 4.25% to 4.5% by the end of 2024 and by another 100 basis points by the end
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:53.120]   of 2025. So, December 2025, we could see the Fed funds rate at 3.25% to 3.5%. This rate
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.440]   cut is significant, and there is a lot that this rate cut will do for your money. In the
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.640]   short run, we're talking cuts to credit card interest rates, auto loans. The Fed funds
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.280]   rate is the overnight bank lending rate. It's the shortest end of the yield curve. Mortgage
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.480]   rates have already come down about 1.5% to 2%. The 10-year bond yield has come down in
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:21.440]   anticipation of this rate cut. However, given that the Fed has signaled continuous cuts
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:27.800]   over the next 16, 18 months, we should expect mortgage rates on the long end, the 10-year
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:34.240]   bond yield, specifically, to fade down as well. It might fade down to 3% by this time
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.240]   next year.
[00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.720]   So, I want to first talk about what the Fed rate cut means for the real estate sector.
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.680]   I am bullish on the real estate sector because I think we are heading into a really Goldilocks
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.160]   type of scenario. There is pent up demand. Many, many people over the past couple of
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.160]   years since the Fed started raising rates and since mortgage rates started going up
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.840]   aggressively have been holding off on buying. One, because they can't afford to, and two,
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.280]   because they think or they thought that higher mortgage rates would depress housing prices.
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.880]   Well, housing prices have come down in areas where you can build a lot of supply. For example,
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.760]   Austin, Texas or Boise, Idaho, where prices are down 10 to 15% from the peak. But those
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.520]   prices went astronomical during the pandemic. So, it's just a normalization here.
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.140]   There is a structural undersupply of homes. We're talking millions of homes undersupply
[00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:36.560]   in this nation. And it's going to get worse because from 2022 to right now, 2024, builders
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.200]   weren't building because it cost too much to build. So, this is going to be a lag effect.
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.920]   There's going to be undersupply going forward over the next several years. I don't see how
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.040]   this problem is going to get fixed. Three, you've got declining mortgage rates now, right?
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.840]   They're about 1.5% off from the peak, maybe 2% off from the peak actually. And they're
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.400]   probably going lower. In addition, we're probably going to have a soft economic landing or maybe
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:08.080]   a mild recession. A 50 basis point cut is signifying that the Fed sees a slowdown in
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.720]   the economy, specifically in the labor market. And they wouldn't have done 50 if they didn't
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.160]   see a greater slowdown than expected. If it was 25, they'd be like, well, okay, not too
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.840]   bad. But 50, maybe they see a little bit more sense of urgency. But in a way, that can be
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.400]   good because that shows that the Fed doesn't want to be too far behind the curve.
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.520]   Another positive for real estate is record high stock market wealth, 5,600 plus on the
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:38.840]   S&P 500. The market has created a tremendous amount of wealth for listeners, for readers
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:45.080]   of Financial Samurai, for the 60 plus percent Americans who own homes and the 50, what,
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:51.160]   5% of Americans who own stock. So when you have more wealth, you're going to spend it.
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.760]   And we're entering a multi-year Fed rate cut cycle, right? By this time next year, the
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:03.400]   Fed funds rate could be down another one and a half percentage points. Further, with rates
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:10.480]   coming down, I see a potential rotation of capital from public equities more to real
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.040]   estate, private real estate, residential real estate, commercial real estate. There are
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.820]   opportunities to be had specifically in the commercial office real estate market. A lot
[00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:26.560]   of bombed out prices trading at 40, 60% discounts to where they were first purchased before
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:32.440]   the pandemic began. And you are seeing, you are seeing investors make those investments
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.560]   right now. And I think over a 10-year period, it's going to turn out to be quite good for
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.360]   them. Now that the Fed has cut rates, I think a lot of people are going to start getting
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.800]   off the sideline. Retail buyers, people who don't follow personal finance sites or listen
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.000]   to personal finance podcasts, are thinking to themselves, well, the Fed cuts rate, that
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.760]   means mortgage rates are going down. However, we all know that the Fed doesn't control mortgage
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.720]   rates. They influence mortgage rates, but mortgage rates are controlled by the bond
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:08.160]   market. So the mortgage rates have already moved. But what I see happening now is millions
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.880]   and millions of people looking at the headlines, listening to podcasts, watching TV saying,
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:18.040]   oh, the Fed has cut rates, that means mortgage rates are coming down. It's now safer to come
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.880]   out and buy. And as a result, I think you're going to see an uptick in demand. But the
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:28.460]   one thing that's throttling home buying right now, especially during a cyclically slow period
[00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:33.160]   of the year, right, second half of the year, fourth quarter specifically, is the election
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:39.200]   on November 5th, 2024. People are waiting to figure out who's going to win the presidential
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:44.360]   election in America so they can better understand where they want to live, for example, or what
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:49.660]   type of policies the new president will try to implement and how that will affect real
[00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:55.160]   estate prices, depending on where you live. For example, the salt cap deduction of 10,000,
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:00.320]   maybe that gets eliminated by the next president. And if so, that might create a lot more interest
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:06.000]   in buying coastal city or more expensive city real estate. Just as an example. Another example
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.760]   is first time home buying subsidy credits, right? $25,000 free money. What does that
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:17.840]   mean? Well, that probably means there will be greater demand for first time homes. And
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:24.440]   that means prices for first time homes, lower cost homes might be going up faster than medium
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:29.600]   priced homes or higher priced homes. So as an investor, you probably want to invest in
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:35.880]   first time homes, which would actually make them even more expensive. So there's all these
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:40.800]   second knock effect consequences for government policies that we have to think about and that
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:46.360]   people investors are thinking about until they get greater clarity on who is president,
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:50.820]   the next president of the United States. Now, what does a Fed rate cut mean for the stock
[00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:57.120]   market? Well, as a stock market investor, you have to compare your potential returns
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:01.800]   to the risk free rate of return. The risk free rate of return is the 10 year bond yield
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:09.040]   usually and that is hovering around 3.7%. So that means you wouldn't invest in any risk
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:17.120]   asset unless it returned potentially greater than 3.7% because you can get that risk free.
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:23.080]   Now, in general, lower rates are good for stocks because that means the cost of capital
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:28.400]   is lower, which means companies can borrow and invest more in their businesses. They
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:34.520]   can acquire other businesses. It would be more economic activity with a lower hurdle
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:40.320]   rate, lower interest rate, lower opportunity cost. More capital will be willing to invest
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:46.320]   in stocks because the opportunity cost of investing in a risk free asset like a 10 year
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:50.440]   bond yield is lower. So in other words, let's say the 10 year bond yield was very high.
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:57.120]   Let's say it was at 50%. You wouldn't invest in anything else that wasn't going to return
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:01.360]   greater than 50% because 50% is huge just doing nothing and especially if let's say
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:08.120]   inflation was under 50%. So this is what stock investors are thinking now. Okay, we're modeling
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:13.400]   out a decline in the Fed funds rate, a potential decline in long term bond yields. So as a
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:19.080]   result, we want to look at other asset classes to potentially generate a greater return.
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:25.500]   The tricky scenario is if the Fed is behind the curve and a recession comes where there
[00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:31.160]   are two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth and the unemployment rate surges from
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:37.600]   the low 4 percentage point to 5 plus percent in a matter of 6 to 12 months. If that were
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:43.600]   to occur, then I expect the stock market, specifically the S&P 500 to go down and we
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:48.440]   have precedence for this. In the 1990s, the Fed started cutting rates, stock market went
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:56.440]   down. In 2007, during the most bubblish year of my lifetime at least, the Fed also delivered
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:04.680]   a half point rate cut on September 18, 2007. And what transpired then was the global financial
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:11.440]   crisis, which was the most devastating downturn in our lifetimes. In hindsight, it was clear
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:18.920]   the Federal Reserve was behind the ball. They had let the housing market bubble to crazy
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:24.440]   amounts, crazy levels, the stock market was going crazy, a lot of speculation. And then
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:28.840]   they were too late to start cutting. And then by the time they started cutting, everything
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:29.840]   unraveled.
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:33.600]   Today, things are a little bit better. Actually, they're much better. The corporate balance
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:38.960]   sheets are much better. Personal balance sheets are much, much better. Just look at the charts
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:45.600]   on how much home equity there is, how much money is in money market funds, how much lower
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:50.840]   the gearing is for corporate balance sheets in terms of having less debt. Profitability
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:56.280]   is much higher. So I don't think the Fed is as behind as it was back then. It might be
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:10:03.320]   a little bit behind, which is okay, but it's nowhere near as behind as it was in late 2007.
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:10.360]   As a result, I think with a telegraphed declining interest rate environment over the next 16
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:17.480]   to 18 months, plus a slowdown in the economy, softer landing, I think equities can do okay.
[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:25.840]   They are overvalued from a historical KPE ratio, something like 30%. But if earnings
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:32.360]   can continue to grow over the next 12 months, maybe this current P multiple is not as expensive
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.440]   as it will be in the future.
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:42.600]   On a relative basis, though, if I had, let's say $10 to invest, I would invest $6, $7 of
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:47.280]   that into real estate because we have this huge tailwind going on with lower rates. Look
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:53.040]   at the publicly traded ETFs and real estate ETFs, as well as real estate companies like
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:57.800]   Redfin and Zillow. Those stocks are on fire. They are very forward-looking. They are quick
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:03.680]   to move, whereas residential real estate prices are slow to move, as well as private commercial
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:04.960]   real estate prices.
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:11.960]   Now for public stocks, I would still invest $2 or $3 of the $10 in the S&P 500 or your
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:19.200]   stocks of choice, because it's a low cost, easy way to gain exposure to the US economy,
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:24.600]   which is still growing. Despite elevated valuations, historically, the S&P 500 has returned about
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:31.640]   10% a year. Now, maybe the future returns might be lower. 7.8% is what JP Morgan predicts
[00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:36.000]   over the next 20 years. And I know they're going to change their forecast next year.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:42.480]   Vanguard is even more bearish. They're looking at like 4% to 5% annual returns over the next
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:49.280]   10 years for the S&P 500 US equities specifically. So that's something to consider. However,
[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:54.760]   again, investing in stocks have traditionally shown to be one of the biggest and best wealth
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:59.600]   creators over the long term at a low cost, and it's very easy to do.
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:05.840]   And then finally, I would invest the remaining $1 or $2 in private growth companies, specifically
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:12.560]   venture capital in the AI space. I'm here in San Francisco. I can't escape AI. I'm going
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:18.400]   to an AI party tonight. It's just everywhere. And we are seeing real use cases for AI as
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:25.120]   apps and software and products are being built. So by investing 10% to 20% of new cash flow
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:31.320]   or your existing portfolio in private growth companies, I think you have a good hedge.
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:35.600]   You have a hedge just in case these companies do extremely well in the future. You hear
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:43.200]   open AI trying to raise something like $6 billion plus at $150 billion valuation at
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:49.920]   the end of 2024, when they just raised at an $80 billion valuation in February 2024.
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:56.320]   So that's a huge gain in just 6 to 10 months. And I don't want to miss out on that. So I'm
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:04.480]   willing to allocate 10% to 20% of cash flow or existing capital to AI. If AI does great,
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:10.880]   this capital will do great. If AI turns out to be an overhyped bust, well, the capital
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:16.600]   will underperform probably the S&P 500. But at least our children will still have jobs
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:21.120]   and have purpose and meaning as AI doesn't take over their lives.
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:26.520]   All right, we've talked about how the Fed funds rate will affect borrowing costs, real
[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:33.080]   estate and stocks. Let's talk about how the Fed funds cuts will affect your safe retirement
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:39.640]   withdrawal rate. Back in 2020, during the height of COVID, I introduced the Financial
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:47.520]   Samurai Dynamic Safe Retirement Withdrawal Rate. And that equals 80% of whatever the
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:54.400]   10-year bond yield is at the time. And I came up with that because I look back in the 1990s
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:14:02.080]   when the 4% rule was created, and it was created when the 10-year bond yield was between 5
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:09.240]   to 6%. So 4% is 80% of 5 to 6%. So I went with that and I went with that logic. It's
[00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:16.360]   an easy way to think about how to withdraw money when you no longer have a day job. Now,
[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:22.200]   when I introduced this, the 10-year bond yield was at about 0.6% because so much capital
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:29.600]   was fleeing stocks, fleeing real estate at the time to the safety of Treasury bonds,
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:34.920]   sovereign bonds by the United States government. If the world was going to hell and the virus
[00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:39.680]   was going to eat up and take over and kill everybody, at least we had the safety of Treasury
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:46.600]   bonds. So as bond prices went up, yields went down. And when I talk about 80% of the 10-year
[00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:56.080]   bond yield, that means having a safe retirement withdrawal rate of 0.5% because 0.65% times
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:15:03.880]   80% is about 0.5%. And when I talked about this, a bunch of people on the internet went
[00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:11.700]   apoplectic saying, "This is a ridiculous assumption. 0.5% is way too low. That would
[00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:18.800]   require 200 times my annual expenses for me to retire early. Screw you. This is ridiculous.
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:22.080]   You're a chump." Whatever it is. And a lot of bad words. It's actually quite interesting
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:29.320]   how much fire there was. But you have to remember, this is a dynamic safe withdrawal rate. It
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:35.760]   changes as conditions change, economic conditions change, pandemic, vaccine, whatever. People
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:41.480]   move on with their lives change. It changes. And what I failed to understand was that people
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:46.080]   are stuck in this static mindset. They say, "Oh, 4% roll. Inverse that. 25 times your
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:51.560]   annual expenses, boom, you can retire with that net worth." But the thing is that is
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:55.880]   lazy thinking. That's easy thinking because you're like, "Okay, 4% roll. It is what it
[00:15:55.880 --> 00:16:02.400]   is." But if you stick with a 4% roll from 40 years ago, when the world is changing,
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:08.160]   you could get blown up. You could get left behind. And I don't want you all to get left
[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:14.120]   behind. I want you to make more money than the median person or the average person so
[00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:19.840]   you can live a more free life sooner rather than later. So, if you adopted my dynamic
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:25.040]   safe withdrawal rate, then what you did was you lowered it to 0.5% during the worst of
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:32.020]   the pandemic. Instead of 4%, you're at 0.5%. And guess what? You had more capital. You
[00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:38.120]   had more safety to protect yourself against the unknown. And if you were so courageous
[00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:45.080]   and daring, you could have used that spread, 4% minus 0.5% or 3.5%, and used that extra
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:52.720]   capital to invest in risk assets like stocks, real estate, or whatever at depressed prices.
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:58.880]   And guess what, folks? Four and a half years later, you are much wealthier because of it.
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:04.920]   And not only did you invest more wisely, calmly, and diligently, your mental health was probably
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:10.600]   better at that time because you followed a dynamic framework that guided you during uncertain
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:15.640]   times. And as times got better, you could increase your safe withdrawal rate.
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:21.680]   Well, what's interesting to note is that just as the Fed starts its multi-year rate
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:30.600]   cut cycle, investment houses like JP Morgan, PGIMDC, which I've never heard of, and others
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:39.480]   are calling for an increase in the safe withdrawal rate from 4% to 5%. How is that logical? Let's
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:44.840]   think about it. If interest rates are coming down and the Fed is cutting rates because
[00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:52.600]   it fears a recession, that means there is more risk ahead. Slowdown, lose job, whatnot.
[00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:57.920]   There's risk there. Second, if interest rates are coming down, that means your risk-free
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:04.600]   rate of return is coming down. Therefore, you've got to take on more risk. And if you
[00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:10.040]   take on more risk, there's a greater chance you might lose money. You cannot, in a low
[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:14.000]   interest rate environment, generate as much risk-free income to pay for your retirement.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.760]   That was one of the benefits of higher rates. Savers were rewarded with five, five and a
[00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:24.800]   half percent risk-free money. That was amazing. That was enough to pay for life. But now,
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:30.840]   with rates going down, not so much. So why would you suggest increasing the safe withdrawal
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:37.520]   rate? But here's the other point of inconsistency from these investment houses. JP Morgan, for
[00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:43.120]   example, is expecting the next 20 years for public equities in the United States to return
[00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:50.720]   7.8% per annum versus the historical 10% per annum return. Now that's 2.2% decline. While
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:58.280]   Vanguard is expecting 4% to 5% public equity returns for the next 10 years. And that's
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:06.800]   5% to 6% below the historical rate of return of the S&P 500. So if you are expecting lower
[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:14.760]   rates of equity returns and relatively stable to slightly lower bond yield returns, then
[00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:21.040]   it is completely counterintuitive and completely illogical to then suggest increasing your
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:28.920]   safe withdrawal rate in retirement. Even Bill Begum, the creator of the 4% rule in the mid-1990s,
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:34.840]   is also revising his recommended safe withdrawal rate up. He told Barron's that in his upcoming
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:41.280]   book he may endorse a rate very close to 5%. Now, I was trying to think why Bill would
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:49.540]   raise his recommended safe withdrawal rate by 25%, right, 4% to 5%. And I realized it's
[00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:54.720]   because he might be stuck in the past. He's writing a book. I've written books, right?
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:58.960]   Buy this, not that. How to engineer your layoff. It takes two plus years to write a book. The
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:04.560]   ideas you have when you first start writing a book and the ideas you have two years later
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:10.920]   can change. The world can change. Again, back to being dynamic in thought and in action.
[00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:18.440]   The dynamic safe withdrawal rate. Yes, 5% withdrawal rate made sense back in mid-2023
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:24.400]   when the 10-year bond yield was about 5% and long-term treasury bonds were yielding 5.5%.
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:29.680]   We talked about this before. Lock in some of that long-term treasury bond money at five
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:35.380]   plus percent. So good because I believed interest rates would eventually roll over. I've been
[00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:41.120]   believing that forever. Long-term interest rates are going to head down because of technology,
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:46.640]   efficiency, and better coordination among global economies. But today is different from
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:51.880]   yesterday. It's different from a year ago. The world changes and you cannot stick to
[00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:57.960]   ideas of the past if you want to keep up with people in the present, let alone wanting to
[00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:03.380]   outperform them. Being a retirement researcher is completely different than being an actual
[00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:09.060]   retiree with no active income, no steady paycheck, no retirement benefits, no subsidized health
[00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:14.480]   care benefits, nothing. You're on your own. Retiring is one of the most psychologically
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:21.380]   challenging transitions to face. You will not know how it feels like until you say goodbye
[00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:27.880]   to your job. Trust me on this, folks. I've been gone since 2012 and I struggled immensely
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:33.060]   during the first one to two years wondering, "Did I make a mistake? Did I blow myself up?
[00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:38.060]   Oh my gosh, what am I doing with my life? I'm screwed. What am I going to do?" But then
[00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:43.580]   over time, things change and then your expenses change. Your life changes. You might have
[00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:48.380]   children. You might want to buy a house. You might want to relocate. Something bad might
[00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:53.860]   happen. Things change all the time. Back to being dynamic and flexible with that change.
[00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:58.700]   Once you are retired, you don't have the luxury of pontificating about what retirement
[00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:05.100]   is like with numbers because you have real expenses to pay. You don't have a backup.
[00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:10.340]   And when you don't have a backup in the form of a day job or a wealthy spouse or a rich
[00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:15.740]   uncle or some kind of side hustle that brings in a lot of money, you have to be more precise
[00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:21.820]   in your analysis. Now, I know surveys have showed that 40-50% of retirees just wing it
[00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:25.740]   when it comes to their finances. Just like most people, I think, wing it when it comes
[00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:29.740]   to trying to build wealth. And then they wake up 10 years later and wonder, "Where did
[00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:36.540]   all my money go?" I suggest you not wing it. I suggest you follow a framework. You don't
[00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:40.660]   have to follow my framework if you don't believe in it, if you don't want to. But at least
[00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:45.300]   you should follow some type of framework to keep yourself honest so you consistently review
[00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:50.740]   your finances, you consistently save and invest for the future, and you consistently look
[00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:55.620]   at your asset allocation and compare it to your true risk tolerance and your goals.
[00:22:55.620 --> 00:23:00.460]   I'm excited over the next two years because the Fed is finally providing a tailwind for
[00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:05.820]   investors and for folks who want to work hard and make more money. Now, the Fed is not going
[00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:12.380]   to be great for savers, but rates are still relatively high and you still want to be disciplined
[00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:17.260]   in your saving and budgeting. But for those who want to work hard, who want to take more
[00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:22.300]   risks, who want to start companies, having this tailwind is a good thing. Just make sure
[00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:25.780]   you don't get out of hand by borrowing too much money.
