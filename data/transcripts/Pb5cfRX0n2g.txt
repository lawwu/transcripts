[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.820]   the Book of the Acts of the Apostles, in the second chapter, in reading again the first
[00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:18.380]   two verses. The first two verses in the second chapter of the Book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:27.720]   And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:38.320]   And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing, mighty wind, and it filled
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:46.000]   all the house where they were gathered together. Now I read those two verses, but I rather
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.040]   intend to put before you what we read just now as the content of the first twenty-one
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:59.000]   verses in this second chapter of the Book of the Acts of the Apostles. I do this as
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.760]   a part of a proposal which I indicated last Sunday night when I said that I hoped to consider
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.920]   with you certain select messages from this Book of the Acts of the Apostles. We began
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.520]   to do that last Sunday night in looking at the first part of the first chapter.
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.480]   Now what we are trying to do is this. We are going back to this Book of the Acts of the
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:30.560]   Apostles because it is the authoritative account, the only account that we have, of the beginning,
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:37.560]   the origin of the Christian Church. Why are we doing that? Are we doing this because we
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:44.640]   are animated by some mere antiquarian interest? Well, I need not waste your time in explaining
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.800]   to you that that is not at all our motive nor our object. I am calling your attention
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:59.080]   to this because I am of the opinion, as all Christian people are of the opinion, that
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.440]   the most urgent and the most vital and the most important thing in the world tonight
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:12.240]   is to know exactly what this Christian message is. And that, in turn, leads us to seek to
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:18.320]   know what the Christian Church is, the Church which delivers this particular message.
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:25.720]   Now, I say that I am animated by a very practical motive. I am here and I am a preacher of the
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.640]   Gospel because I believe that this is the only message under heaven tonight that can
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:38.080]   give anybody any peace or rest of mind and of heart and of conscience. It is the only
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.800]   thing that can really enable one to live and to be more than conqueror. It is the only
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:52.520]   thing that holds us out any hope for that which lies beyond the veil, beyond this temporary
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:59.960]   life of ours in this passing world of time. And therefore, I hold it before you because
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:05.880]   that is true for all individuals, but at the same time, if we have any concern about the
[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.600]   whole state of the world and the state of our own country, well, then I again suggest
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:16.480]   that there is nothing that is of greater practical value and more urgently necessary than that
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.920]   we should understand the nature and the character of this Christian message.
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:28.920]   But, as I was indicating last Sunday night, the greatest tragedy of all the tragedies
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:35.600]   in the world tonight is the confusion about Christianity, the confusion about the Christian
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:44.160]   church, her nature, her task, and her message. This, to me, is beyond any comparison the
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.720]   greatest tragedy of all. For it is clear, if only everybody in the world tonight became
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:56.000]   truly Christian, most of the problems that beset us would immediately disappear. Think
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.760]   of the problems harassing the life of mankind tonight in an individual sense or in a collective
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.920]   sense. Think of the unhappiness. Think of the misery. Think of the heartbreak. Think
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.800]   of the disappointment, the disillusionment. Think of all the cynicism, all the bitterness
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:19.640]   in life. There it is. We are all aware of these human problems, as they are called.
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:25.040]   You know, my friends, if people were only truly Christian, most of those problems would
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:32.720]   immediately be solved. It is likewise with our international tensions and problems. Enmity
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:40.760]   and war and strife and all these things are all due to man's wrong relationship to God,
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:46.520]   and he will only find what that true relationship is and how he can ever enter into it, by knowing
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:53.440]   and believing and accepting and submitting himself to the message of the Christian church,
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.360]   the message of the Christian gospel. Now, those are my reasons for putting all this
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:05.480]   before you. Now, what is this message? Well, we've started with this fundamental postulate.
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:12.680]   You and I don't decide what it is. How can we decide what it is? I can give my opinion.
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:18.480]   Anybody can give an opinion. But what's the value of the opinion? What's it based upon?
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:23.320]   What sanction is there for it? What authority lies behind it? It's no use saying, "This
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.760]   is what I think. This is my view of Christianity." Men are doing that, and so much of that is
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:36.360]   being accepted as the truth. But it seems to me to be dishonest to do so. Not only is
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:42.320]   it dishonest, it is wrong. And not only is it wrong, but ultimately it's foolish for
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:49.320]   this reason. You never will understand, you can't hope to understand, the story of the
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:54.520]   Christian church if you approach it like that. The Christian church, after all, is a remarkable
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.920]   phenomenon in the history of the world. Here it is starting, as we see here, in a handful
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:05.440]   of people, ordinary, ignorant, unlettered men. And yet we read in a few chapters about
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:10.680]   these disciples being described as these men were turning the world upside down. And we
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:16.000]   know that it became the official religion of the Roman Empire in a few centuries. Not
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.240]   that we approve of that of necessity, but it's just a sheer fact. And what I'm saying
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:26.200]   is this, that if you don't accept the explanation that is given here of the church, you cannot
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:34.920]   explain her success. It's just impossible. So for every reason we are driven back to
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:40.560]   the book of the Acts of the Apostles, which is our only authoritative statement about
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:45.680]   the formation of the church, the character of the church, the function of the church,
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.800]   and the success and the spread of the church throughout that ancient world.
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:56.800]   Now then, we saw last Sunday night that the great message of the church is, as Luke puts
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:04.680]   it here at the very beginning, about the Lord Jesus Christ. The former treatise of Amid
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:12.680]   or Theophilus of all that Jesus began both to do and to teach, until the day when he
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:20.880]   was taken up into heaven. That's the message, and we looked at it. You see, this is the
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:26.080]   message of Christianity. It isn't primarily a teaching about what we think of this problem
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:32.280]   or that, or what we think should be done. No, no, it's about Jesus Christ. It's about
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:38.440]   him. It's about this person, who he is, why he came, what he did, what's he doing now,
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:43.520]   what's he going to do. All that Jesus began both to do and to teach until the day in which
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:49.840]   he was taken up, after that he, through the Holy Ghost, had given commandments unto the
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:55.680]   apostles whom he had chosen. That's it. That's what Christianity is about. It isn't what
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:00.440]   I think about war or industry. It isn't the advice I've got to give tonight to the government
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:08.840]   of this or any other land. That's not Christianity. This is Christianity. What Jesus began both
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:16.720]   to do and teach, what he's doing, what he's yet going to do. Right, there is the beginning.
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:21.920]   Well now then, we go on, and because we see that he addressed these men, these apostles
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:28.360]   of his, and he gave them a certain commission. And then we come in this second chapter to
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:35.640]   the real origin of the Christian Church. And here it is before us. This is the thing that
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:41.480]   throws light on the character, the nature of the Church, what she has been commissioned
[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:46.920]   to do and how she does it. And the thing that I want to hold before you tonight is this.
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:54.040]   It's the thing that's emphasized here at the very beginning. The whole thing is the action
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:09:03.040]   of God. It's the action of God. This is not something that was done by this handful of
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:09.000]   people. One's never tired of pointing out what we are told so often about them and what
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:15.280]   they say about themselves, that they were nobodies, nobodies at all. They were dismissed
[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:21.680]   by the learned people, by the authorities, as ignorant and unlettered men. And that is
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:27.680]   what they were. They were fishermen and so on. And here they are. Now, it is to me just
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:33.240]   simply ludicrous to suggest that these men with this character, without learning, without
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:38.000]   any influence or authority, without any money behind them, none of the means of propaganda,
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:45.160]   in fact quite the reverse, it is ludicrous to suggest that these men by their own efforts
[00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:50.560]   and by their own abilities succeeded in doing what we read of in the pages of this book
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:55.040]   and what we read of in the subsequent history of the Christian Church. The thing is just
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:10:02.120]   monstrously ridiculous. There is only one answer. It isn't what they did. It's what
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:10.080]   God did to them, in them, through them, by means of them. And that is the essential message
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:15.440]   concerning the Christian Church, her meaning, her function, her message, her purpose.
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:24.800]   Now, here it is, all of it here before us, in its origin, in its beginning. But if you
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:30.920]   take the trouble to read the long history of the Christian Church, you'll find it continues
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:35.920]   to be the same thing. Indeed, I want to show you that the history of the Church can be
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:42.560]   put like this. It has been a great fight, a conflict between two ideas, the false idea
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:48.080]   of men as to what the Church is, and the true Church, with God acting.
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:53.880]   Now, let me hold before you, then, the true character of the Church and the true nature
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:11:00.680]   of her message. This thing which I'm asserting is more important for our consideration tonight
[00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:05.280]   than anything else whatsoever. Let's look at it in the light of what we are told in
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:12.080]   these first twenty-one verses of this second chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:18.840]   What is Christianity? What is the Church? Well, let's start with the negative. Let's
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:26.040]   remind ourselves, first of all, of what it is not, and oh, how this is needed today.
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:30.880]   I'm more and more convinced that the masses of people are outside the Christian Church
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:38.000]   because they've got a totally wrong conception of what she is. Mark you, I want to be honest,
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.720]   I don't blame them. I don't blame them. They just believe so much of what they're
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:48.120]   told, this false view which I'm now going to put before you. But that's why they're
[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:53.920]   outside. If they only knew what this really is, if they only knew what's being offered
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:58.120]   them in the Gospel, they wouldn't be outside like these people at Jerusalem. They've
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:04.200]   become crowding to listen to it. This is the most urgent matter. What is it not? Well,
[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:13.080]   let me start by saying that Christianity is not dead religion. This is the first point
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:19.600]   we've got to have clear in our minds. Shall I put it like this to you? The greatest enemy
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:28.520]   of the Christian truth has always been religion. Always. And that is as true tonight as it
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:40.080]   has ever been at any other time. It is religion that confuses the minds of men and women.
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:45.320]   Regarding Christianity, the message of the Christian Church and the Church as a religion,
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:51.760]   they reject it. And they're right in rejecting it if it's dead. But it isn't dead. Now
[00:12:51.760 --> 00:13:00.360]   what do I mean by religion? Well, let me put it simply, plainly, and bluntly. Christianity
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:09.440]   is not a state religion. It's not an official religion in any sense at all. But that's
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:14.840]   the idea that many people have of it. That's what they think of the Church and of Christianity.
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:20.200]   The thought of the Church is simply to think of what happens on certain great and ceremonial
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:27.720]   occasions. That's Christianity to them. It means nothing else. They think of it in a
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:36.460]   national sense, coronation, or the burial of a monarch or of a great statesman or something
[00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:42.080]   like that, service and solemnity. That's their idea of Christianity. Some official
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:48.840]   religion. In the war, of course, people thought of it in terms of national days of prayer.
[00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:52.760]   They didn't think about Christianity at any other time. But when things went wrong and
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:58.080]   we were losing every battle and some important dreadnoughts were sunk, national day of prayer.
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:03.760]   This is Christianity. But, my dear friend, that's religion. That's national religion.
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:12.440]   It's got nothing to do with Christianity. People think of it in terms of some formal
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:20.600]   set occasions. Isn't this the common view of Christianity? A christening. A child is
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:25.280]   born to the family. People haven't thought about Christianity, perhaps for years. A child
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:30.480]   must have him christened. That's Christianity. Then they forget all about it again. And then
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:39.720]   a marriage. Service in a church. So much better than a registry office. More dignity, ceremonial.
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:44.920]   The church is an institution to provide ceremonial for certain big and important, and again as
[00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:50.200]   I say, a funeral service. My dear friends, I don't want to keep you, but I'm just
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:58.520]   here to say that that's nothing to do with Christianity. I almost feel like summarizing
[00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:05.480]   it in terms of today. Christianity, let me say, is not what the BBC seems to think it
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:15.920]   is. I say that with all respect to a great man. And as a man, and as one who's interested
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:22.960]   in the affairs of this country, I'm second to none in my admiration of human greatness.
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:28.120]   But because a man's a great man, it doesn't mean he's a Christian of necessity. And
[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:32.360]   the whole of the Christian church doesn't revolve around any person, howsoever great
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:42.200]   and distinguished. That's not Christianity. That's religion. Something entirely different.
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:46.400]   We've got to get rid of this notion, I say, that the church is just a human institution,
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:52.200]   a national institution, or any other form of institution. She's not a club. She's
[00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:57.800]   not just a society where people meet together and do certain things. A church is not a building.
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:02.000]   I never like people referring to a building as a church. I'm going down to the church,
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:08.160]   they say, you're not. A church doesn't consist of a building. It consists of people,
[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:16.120]   living souls, with the Lord in the midst. We must get rid of this formal notion, this
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:23.360]   external notion, this idea of just paying a kind of formal visit upon God and then forgetting
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:30.280]   all about him. As I say, the proposal coming, oh, so monstrously in the name of the Christian
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:33.920]   church that you just do that at nine o'clock on a Sunday morning and then go and enjoy
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:39.520]   yourself the rest of the day. It's the exact opposite of that. That's religion. It's
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:44.120]   the very antithesis of the Christian faith. But let me sum up this point by putting it
[00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:51.600]   like this. And perhaps this is the best way of putting it. Any notion that Christianity
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:17:03.040]   is mainly the result of something that we do, is always completely wrong, fatally wrong.
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:10.320]   The church, I say, is not a voluntary society of certain people. We must get rid of this
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:18.240]   notion that it's the result of our action and that we are but perpetuating some tradition.
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:24.560]   Now, if our view of Christianity is determined and controlled by tradition, it isn't the
[00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:29.080]   real thing. It's the false thing, in fact. That was the curse of the Jews who finally
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:34.880]   crucified the Lord Jesus Christ. They were traditional religionists. And traditional
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:40.360]   religionists have always been, and are today, the greatest enemies of the true church and
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:46.840]   the true Christian faith and message. But how much of so-called Christianity is just
[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:53.040]   this? I want you to ask your friends a serious question, my friend, tonight, at this moment.
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:58.840]   Why do you attend a place of worship? Do you know? Do you even know? Have you thought enough
[00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:03.840]   about it to know even that? Are you doing it simply because it's a tradition, you've
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:07.920]   been brought up in it, and people, you say, have always done it? Is that it? No, that's
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:13.360]   not Christianity. That's something you do. You're perpetuating a tradition. You're
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:17.880]   just carrying on with something that has been done throughout the running centuries. And
[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:21.040]   there are many who, having thought that that was the thing, have stopped doing it. They
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:24.400]   say, "We're no longer going to do this. We don't believe in it." And they stop.
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:32.080]   And in a sense, they're quite logical. They're perfectly right. But it isn't Christianity.
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:38.480]   So I say, if we've got hold of this notion that it's something that we do, if it's
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:45.800]   something that is just a matter of duty, you go to church, you attend a service, you hope
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:50.960]   it isn't going to be too long, but you've done your duty. You haven't felt anything,
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:59.120]   felt nothing at all. The service has been absolutely lifeless, miserable singing, interning
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:05.080]   of the Scriptures. You get it in the free churches as well as the others, but no life,
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:11.080]   no power, no vigour. My dear friend, you can't fit that into the book of the Acts of the
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:16.440]   Apostles. It's the exact opposite. And it is because so many have thought that that
[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:20.280]   is Christianity that they've finished with it and turned their backs upon it. I'm trying
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:25.960]   to show you that what they've turned their backs upon is traditional religion. God knows
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:31.320]   I turned my back on that many years ago. I would never have been in a Christian pulpit,
[00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:37.640]   but for the fact that I saw through that and turned my back on it. That's not Christianity.
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:42.920]   That is traditional, formal religion, whatever form it may chance to take. And let me be
[00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:47.720]   still more specific. There are some people who seem to have seen through the formality
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:55.640]   and they think they compensate for it by producing an exciting kind of service, and have what
[00:19:55.640 --> 00:20:01.400]   they call gimmicks, I think they call it today, and stunts and entertainments to have a lively
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:07.560]   bright service. That doesn't make the slightest difference at all, because it's man still
[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:15.200]   doing it. Anything that is controlled by men is not true Christianity. Christianity is
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:27.160]   always the activity of God. Suddenly, the sound of a mighty rushing wind, God. So you
[00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:32.600]   see your bright lively services, entertainment program, this item coming on, that one, that's
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:37.960]   not Christianity either. It's livelier than the other, but it's not the life of the spirit,
[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:46.400]   it's the activity of man. Very well, there is my first point, that's not Christianity.
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:55.080]   Anything controlled by us, whether it's lifeless or lively, is not Christianity. Christianity
[00:20:55.080 --> 00:21:01.360]   is that which controls us, which masters us, which happens to us. Very well, let's go to
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:15.000]   my second negative. In Christianity, the God who is worshipped is not an unknown God. The
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:21.480]   God of religion is always an unknown God. You remember the classic description of it
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:26.920]   given by this same author in the seventeenth chapter of the visit of the great Apostle
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:33.360]   Paul to Athens. He saw the place cluttered up with all sorts of temples to their various
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:38.160]   gods, but he came across the most intriguing and fascinating temple amongst them all, because
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:42.880]   it had got a peculiar inscription over it, and the inscription was this, "To the unknown
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:49.480]   God." You see what had happened was, that the philosophers had been using their minds
[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:54.920]   and having accounted for the God of love and of war and of peace and so on, they had a
[00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:58.200]   feeling that there was still another power that they couldn't cater for, they didn't
[00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:02.200]   know him. They said, "He's the unknown God, and he seems to be the most powerful of all,
[00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:08.000]   the unknown God." Paul says, "That's not Christianity. Whom ye ignorantly worship him,
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:17.720]   declare I unto you." Now, the God of religion is always an unknown God, and this is as true
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:25.800]   today as it's ever been. There are many people who rarely have never thought about God at
[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:32.360]   all. I am ready to adopt the language of people whose views I totally dissent from, but at
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:36.840]   this point, they're perfectly right in what they say. They say so many people are worshipping
[00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:46.760]   a father figure, projecting some idea of father, that's their God. It's perfectly true of large
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:51.840]   numbers of people. There's no question about that. It is possible for us to say our prayers
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:57.960]   mechanically and never even to think about God, who God is, what God is. He's entirely
[00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:05.320]   unknown. Some kind of superstition. There are many people like that.
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:10.120]   But then you see, there is another group, and it's most interesting to observe this
[00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:14.360]   second group. They're the great critics of the first group, and they're very popular.
[00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:18.840]   They're notorious even at the present time. They say the masses of people are worshipping
[00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:23.800]   this father figure. They're worshipping ignorance, they're worshipping religion, they're worshipping
[00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:27.920]   themselves, they're worshipping tradition. What then should they worship? Well, they
[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:34.560]   tell us. And here you come to what you may call the God of the philosophers. The God
[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:40.560]   of the philosophers. What is God? Well, they tell you, God, they say, is the ground of
[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:51.920]   all being. That's God. The ground of all being. Or they may describe him as the absolute,
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:59.320]   or the ultimate. What's God? Well, God is the vague power that is somewhere behind the
[00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:07.880]   universe. God is force. God, they say, is love. And indeed, they really mean by that
[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:12.160]   many of them, that love is God. They say, wherever you find love, you find God. So they
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:16.480]   tell you, don't go to a church to find God. Go out into the world, go into the pubs, and
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:23.200]   there you'll find kindness, one shown to another. That's God. Where love is, God is.
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:32.120]   So God becomes something abstract, just some general benevolence, just some vague activity
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:39.440]   or power. Well, I mustn't waste your time with these things, but this, we are told,
[00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:46.240]   is what we must substitute for that old superstitious notion of God. This is religion up to date.
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:58.280]   This is down to earth. This is honest to God. This is the truly intellectual view. God is
[00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:03.740]   just the ground of all being. Don't talk about a person. And of course, the result
[00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:09.240]   is you can't pray to such a God. There's no meaning in prayer. You can't pray to goodness.
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:14.080]   You can't pray to love. You can't pray to force. You can't pray to power. But this
[00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:19.880]   is what we are told by so many today, is the living truth and real Christianity, which
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:25.440]   we must substitute for that old traditional religion. And the result is, you see, we are
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:31.680]   left not only very much in the same position, but even worse, if anything. Even worse, if
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:35.160]   anything, because it's almost impossible to follow it, it's almost impossible to know
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:42.000]   what you believe, and certainly it is all still left to you.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:47.440]   And then the third point which I would make is this. And all these things, of course,
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:57.080]   inevitably hang together. And especially this last idea which we are told is the religion
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:02.960]   for the twentieth century men, and especially this post-war men, this atomic age men, this
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:09.740]   scientific men, who, you see, thinks in terms of the ground of being, and so on, and talks
[00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:19.080]   about absolute. That means that this is something then only for certain types of people. And
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:23.880]   those are many who think that. There are some who dismiss this old question of Christianity
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:29.560]   by saying, well, of course, it's all right when people are ignorant and unintelligent,
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:33.640]   and when they can't read, well, we can understand their being Christian. Primitive peoples have
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:38.400]   always been superstitious, and therefore they've always been religious. So they dismiss it
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:42.360]   all by saying it's for ignorant people. We are not ignorant, therefore it's got nothing
[00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:47.880]   to do with us. Others think it's just for good people, but the thing today is this.
[00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:58.600]   It is something peculiarly for the philosophers, for the specialists, for the thinkers, these
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:04.500]   people who can read about philosophy and science and who have understanding. You see, the basic
[00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:09.720]   notion is this, and this is the thing I'm concerned to deal with, that it's something
[00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:16.360]   that one arrives at as the result of one's own reasoning processes. You don't accept
[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:21.120]   any tradition, you don't accept any teaching, in a sense, you really just start with your
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:25.980]   own reasoning. You examine everything. You do that in the realm of science, why shouldn't
[00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:31.560]   you do it here? So you apply your mind, you only believe what you can understand, and
[00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:35.720]   you arrive at a knowledge of the truth that's going to help you as the result of your own
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:41.080]   reason and effort and endeavor. You inquire, you do your research work, you are helped
[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:46.520]   by others who are out in the same quest with yourselves, and at last you arrive at some
[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:54.440]   satisfaction. You say, "I've now got it. God is the ground of all being." And with
[00:27:54.440 --> 00:28:01.960]   your great mind, you've got a formula. That's it. This is the saving formula. The masses
[00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:06.740]   of the people don't know what you're talking about. They don't understand all this. I'm
[00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:11.800]   almost tempted to say that if I had the power of dictatorship in these matters, I would
[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:16.560]   just compel everybody to read some of these latest books on this whole subject, because
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:20.440]   you won't understand them, I'll tell you that now. You won't know what they're talking
[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:26.240]   about. It's impossible to tell. But this is the kind of thing they say. And so the
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:31.300]   masses of the people, they're not interested, they're not concerned. They see these clever
[00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:36.040]   men bringing out their books, answering one another, having a great debate and argument,
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:42.360]   and their one comment and verdict on it all is, "We couldn't care less." "No doubt
[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:46.160]   they make money out of it," they say. "No doubt it helps to keep their jobs going."
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:51.080]   I'm telling you what the man in the street is saying. And my dear friends, this is one
[00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:57.640]   of our greatest problems in this country today. Our Christianity, so-called, has become a
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:04.120]   middle-class movement. The so-called working classes are not touched by it, they're not
[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:10.560]   interested in it, and it's wrong. A message that only appeals to a certain type, a certain
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:17.000]   class, is not the Christian gospel. But you examine the situation today and you'll find
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:22.560]   that what I'm saying is so largely true. There's something wrong somewhere. Christianity
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:29.440]   is not confined to a certain type, a certain class of person. By definition, that isn't
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:33.840]   true. By history, it isn't true. Very well, there I put the negatives before you. Let
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:42.320]   me turn to the positives. What is Christianity? What is the Christian Church? What is her
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:46.640]   message? How did she come into being? How was she acted? How was she persisted? Let
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:52.280]   me answer in the same terms, only that I change the order.
[00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:57.880]   The first thing that should strike anybody who reads the Bible, such a chapter as this
[00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:07.640]   or any other, is this, that you start with the living God. You don't start with men.
[00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:14.440]   What's the first verse in the Bible? It's this, "In the beginning God created." God.
[00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:23.840]   You start with God. And the whole book is dominated by God. This is the message of Christianity.
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:27.680]   And I am convinced that this is the essence of all our troubles today. The trouble with
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:34.000]   this world today is that it doesn't believe in God. And so much of our evangelism goes
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.200]   wrong because it starts with the Lord Jesus Christ. You mustn't, my friend, you must
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:46.000]   start with God the Father, God the Creator. I say with reverence, you cannot understand
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.560]   the Lord Jesus Christ, and there is a sense in which there is no meaning to him and the
[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:55.640]   message about him, unless you start with God the Father.
[00:30:55.640 --> 00:31:03.280]   But the Bible puts this before us in this way, God in three Persons, Blessed Trinity.
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:12.200]   God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Spirit. God, a God who is personal, a God
[00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:23.440]   who can say, "I am, I am going to." Everything is personal. He is a God who, because he is
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:30.520]   a living God, reveals himself. God, contrary to the modern teaching, is not an abstraction,
[00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:39.360]   is not the mere ground of all being, is not the absolute. God is one who reveals himself.
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:44.280]   He is a God who thinks, he is a God who speaks, he is a God who makes proclamations, he is
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:49.720]   a God who reveals himself. Or, looking at it the other way round, he is a God to whom
[00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:57.320]   we can pray, a God to whom we can make our approach. This is the whole message everywhere.
[00:31:57.320 --> 00:32:04.480]   God is one whose glory fills the heavens. He is a God who is over all. God is a living
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:05.480]   God.
[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:14.340]   Now, I could give you almost endless illustrations of this point. Was not that the very thing
[00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:20.560]   which the Apostle preached to those people in Athens? As we find it recorded in this
[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:26.840]   seventeenth chapter, the Apostle we are told here on the tome is such an interesting one.
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:31.440]   While Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred within him when he saw
[00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:38.340]   the city wholly given to idolatry. There they were with their temples to Jupiter, Mercurius,
[00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:42.600]   and the rest, and they were going up in crowds to the temples, taking their offerings. Paul
[00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:46.480]   said, "I cannot stand this. I must tell these people. They are worshipping nothing.
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:50.480]   There is nothing there. They are taking their offerings. They are worshipping idols, and
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:54.000]   they have made them themselves. These are but projections of their own minds. There
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.600]   are no such gods." He said, "These people know nothing about the living God, the true
[00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:02.800]   God." So he began to speak to them, and this is the sort of thing he said to them.
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:10.480]   "Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things you are too superstitious. For as I
[00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:15.360]   pass by and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, 'To the
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:21.600]   unknown God, whom therefore ye ignorantly worship Him, declare I unto you. God that
[00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:27.080]   made the world and all things therein, seeing that He is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:32.260]   not in temples made by hands, neither is He worshipped with men's hands, as though He
[00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:38.760]   needed anything, seeing He giveth into all life and breath and all things, and doth made
[00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:44.440]   of one blood all nations of men, for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and doth determine
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:50.680]   the times before abounded, and the bounds of their habitation," and so on.
[00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:56.720]   Now that's it. That's just a proclamation of this, the living God. You'll read of Paul
[00:33:56.720 --> 00:34:01.720]   down in Thessalonica, what we now call Salonica. He did exactly the same thing. He exhorted
[00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:10.360]   them to turn from idols and to serve the living and the true God, a living God, not a dead
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:16.040]   religion, but a living God. But wait a minute. He's not only a living God, he's an acting
[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:21.380]   God. And here's the point I want to make. Listen, here it is again. When the day of
[00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:28.480]   Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. They'd met together,
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:33.880]   they were praying together, they were waiting. And you know, men in the end can do nothing
[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:44.360]   but wait. "Suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it
[00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:54.920]   filled all the house where they were sitting." Now that's the truth about God. This is the
[00:34:54.920 --> 00:35:00.680]   peculiar point about the Christian message. It's the thing that differentiates it from
[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:10.080]   every other message. Every religion worships a dead God. You take the so-called great religions
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:16.200]   of the East, they're all dead. They've got no living God to turn to. They talk about
[00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:21.240]   nirvana, the absolute, being absorbed into the absolute, and people think it's intelligent
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:28.800]   to believe in something like that. But they're all dead. There's no living God, there's
[00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:35.440]   no acting God, there's no activity. They're all passive, and all is dead, and it's all
[00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:40.480]   a matter of passivity. But you see, this is the very exact opposite. And the whole message
[00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:45.440]   of the Bible is to tell us of what we read here. You remember how these people were all
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:51.200]   amazed and astonished, Cretes and Arabians and all the rest of them. We do hear them
[00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:59.360]   speak in our tongues. What? Well, the wonderful works of God. This is the message of the Christian
[00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:04.600]   church. These men filled with the Holy Spirit were not making their protest against the
[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:08.580]   tyranny of the Roman Empire. They were not deciding what resolution they should send
[00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:13.440]   up to the emperor or to their representatives, their senators and others. They were not expressing
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:21.160]   their opinion on current affairs. No, no, the wonderful works of God. And this is the
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:30.880]   Christian message. It is a proclamation to men, tumbling, stumbling even at noonday in
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:35.800]   darkness, trying to solve their problems and to understand the mystery of life. It is a
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:42.640]   proclamation to them that this is God's world, that God has made it. It hasn't just evolved
[00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:48.160]   in the beginning, God and He created. That God not only made the world, He owns it and
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:53.480]   He controls it. Read some of these great Psalms and they'll tell you how He gives breath
[00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:59.240]   and life to everything, and how if He withdraws this spirit they all collapse and die. God
[00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:06.040]   over all, not men, not even the greatest men, but God who has made everything and who gives
[00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:11.520]   every gift, even to the greatest men. Men has nothing to boast of. Men has nothing but
[00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:16.800]   that He has received it. He hasn't generated it. He hasn't produced it. All our gifts are
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:27.680]   gifts and they are gifts from God. He is the giver of every good and every perfect gift.
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:34.320]   But the point I'm making is that He's a God who is actively interested in this world. He's
[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:42.320]   not some God in the distance, in the vagueness of impersonal religion. No, no, He's living,
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:49.000]   He's active, He's looking down upon the world which He's made and He's concerned about it.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.120]   And the great message of this book, as it was the immediate message of the early Christian
[00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:59.160]   church, was to tell men and women of something about His activity, the wonderful works of
[00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:05.000]   God. What are they? Well, I can't summarize them to you, but I want to emphasize just
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:14.200]   some of them. The great message which we have to preach tonight is this, that this is not
[00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:20.600]   only God's world, but that God hasn't abandoned it. It's in a terrible mess. It's been in
[00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:28.080]   a mess since men rebelled against God and fell in the garden of Eden. And all our troubles
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:34.200]   have come out of that. But here's the message, my dear friend. It isn't man who's going to
[00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:38.400]   redeem it and lift it up again. He's been trying to do it for many centuries. That's
[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:43.240]   the whole story of civilization, that's the whole story of political activity. I'm not
[00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:48.160]   here to criticize them. Let men do his best. He's meant to do his best. He's meant to preserve
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:54.440]   order as far as he can in the chaos, but he'll never redeem it. But, and here's the message,
[00:38:54.440 --> 00:39:01.840]   this is the God that Christianity preaches. He came down into the garden in the cool of
[00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:08.480]   the evening. This is God. This is the only God. This is the living God. This is the true
[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:15.360]   God, a God who's concerned. So he comes down and he speaks to men and he exposes his evil
[00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:19.960]   and he punishes him, but he gives him a promise. And if I hadn't got this promise tonight,
[00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:26.880]   I wouldn't be in this pulpit. The promise is that God is concerned about this world
[00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:34.480]   and its affairs and is doing something about it. Now, my friend, this book is the book
[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:42.160]   of God. It's the history of the activity of God. You see, men, oh, they so turned their
[00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:48.680]   backs upon God and sank into sin that you had those awful conditions before the flood
[00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:55.160]   when they were living not only a materialistic life, not only an immoral life, but an amoral
[00:39:55.160 --> 00:40:00.320]   life, and God visited it with punishment. That's the sort of world you're living in,
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:08.120]   the world of the flood. And then you remember later on how those men in their cleverness
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:15.560]   said we'll build a tower that goes up to heaven. That is the time in the Old Testament that
[00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:21.400]   seems to me to correspond most clearly to the 20th century. Build a temple, build a
[00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:26.800]   tower that will reach into heaven and we are going to do it with our scientific knowledge.
[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:31.920]   Right into heaven we are going to get. But God came down and smashed it and confused
[00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:40.120]   it all. It was God who did it, it was God who acted. The same God acted in Sodom and
[00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:49.520]   Gomorrah and has acted in many a similar Sodom and Gomorrah since. God forbid that this great
[00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:58.520]   city should become Sodom and Gomorrah. Babylon and all these great places, down they've
[00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:06.040]   gone, rubble, nothing. But thank God there's only one side, there's another side, he's
[00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:14.400]   the God of Abraham. What's this great story in the Old Testament? This story of the Jews,
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:19.560]   how did it ever come to pass? The answer is God looked on a man called Abraham living
[00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:25.240]   in paganism in Ur of the Chaldees and he spoke to him and he called him out and Abraham went
[00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:32.520]   out not knowing whether he went, but he was just obeying the call of God. It's all God.
[00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:39.040]   There are endless illustrations of this. I'm simply trying to show you that this is the
[00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:44.000]   essence of Christianity. This is the true message, not you and I dragging ourselves
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   to a lifeless service in which we do everything and feel nothing and God is some abstraction
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:59.720]   away in some infinity. No, no, this is it. A man called Jacob, a pretty poor character
[00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:06.880]   and he'd got a twin brother called Esau. Esau was a natural man, he was a much nicer
[00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:13.920]   man and a better fellow. But do you remember the old story of Jacob as to disappear and
[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:20.760]   to escape for his life? And off he goes and the first night, poor fellow, he couldn't
[00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:27.960]   find a bed to lie on, so he lay on the ground and put a stone under his head as a pillow.
[00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:34.520]   And there he had a most amazing dream. God appeared to him, God spoke to him, this is
[00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:40.880]   it, God interfering in a man's life, God addressing him, God speaking to him, a ladder sent down,
[00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:48.640]   traffic between earth and heaven, God and man. Jacob awakes, astonished and amazed and
[00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:55.720]   says, "This is the house of God. This is none other than the house of God. I didn't
[00:42:55.720 --> 00:43:01.280]   realize it. I thought I was in a wilderness and I put my head upon a stone, but I am in
[00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:06.160]   the house of God and the very gateway and doorway of heaven. I've met with God."
[00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:13.560]   And he had. God had spoken to him. God had come down, sent his angels. This is Christianity.
[00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:18.280]   Or take that great illustration of it, which I read to you at the beginning out of the
[00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:23.560]   third chapter of the book of Exodus. This is, my dear friends, the Christian message.
[00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:28.400]   None of your state religion, none of your formality, none of your brief service when
[00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:33.800]   you do everything and feel nothing. It's this. Listen. Here's a man. He's been a shepherd
[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:38.720]   for 40 years. He was a great man. His name was Moses. He again had had to escape because
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:42.760]   of something he'd done in Egypt. And here he is, apparently going to spend the rest
[00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:47.200]   of his life as a simple shepherd. And one afternoon he takes his sheep to the backside
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:53.560]   of a mountain, not expecting anything at all. But listen, this is what happened. "And the
[00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:58.960]   angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush." You would
[00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:03.000]   never have read the story of the exodus of the children of Israel from Egypt to Canaan,
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:07.480]   but for this, it wasn't an idea that suddenly occurred to Moses. And then he planned it
[00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:13.480]   and schemed it and organized. Far from it, God appears to him and poor Moses fumbles,
[00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:19.200]   hesitates, doesn't understand and says, "I can't." God says, "Go." But this is the thing
[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:25.760]   that's so glorious. Suddenly the angel appeared to him and he looked and beheld the bush burned
[00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:30.680]   with fire and the bush was not consumed. Then Moses made his blunder. Moses said, "I will
[00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:36.720]   now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not burnt. I'm going to investigate."
[00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:40.240]   He's a modern man, you see, a scientist. "What is this? What's this phenomenon? I'm going
[00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:46.560]   to understand this." "God called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said, 'Moses,
[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:52.160]   Moses.' He said, 'Draw not nigh the other. Put off thy shoes from off thy feet for the
[00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:58.200]   place whereon thou standest is holy ground. Moreover, I am the God of thy father, the
[00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:04.200]   God of Abram and of Isaac and the God of Jacob.' And Moses hid his face for he was afraid to
[00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:10.560]   look upon God and rightly so. And the Lord said, 'Oh, if this were not true, there'd
[00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:18.040]   be no message, there'd be no hope.' God said, 'I have surely seen the affliction of my people
[00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:23.720]   which are in Egypt. He's not some impersonal ground of reality. He's not some impersonal
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:32.600]   force or idea or mere love or goodness or kindness. He's personal. I have seen.' And
[00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:40.300]   I have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters, for I know their sorrows. He's
[00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:46.400]   touched with the feeling of our infirmities and our sorrows." And listen, "And I am condemned
[00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:52.840]   to deliver them." And he did. And you have here a great story. Oh, I commend you. Read
[00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:58.520]   your Old Testament. Go on to the 14th chapter of that book of Exodus. And here you'll find
[00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:02.680]   Moses and the people have gone out of Egypt. And they come straight up against the Red
[00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:09.200]   Sea, a mountain on one side and the other, Piraeus and Beelzebub, the hosts of Pharaoh
[00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:13.680]   behind them, Red Sea in front of them. And they don't know what to do. They can't move.
[00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:19.080]   They're on the point of being annihilated and finished. And Moses falls on his face
[00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:24.280]   before God. He doesn't know what to do. And God said to Moses, 'Speak to the children
[00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:29.680]   of Israel that they go forward. Why cryest thou unto me, lying here on thy face on the
[00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:34.840]   ground? Stand up, speak to the children of Israel that they go forward.' And they went.
[00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:41.520]   The God who acts, here it is. And he revealed himself to them on Mount Sinai, revealing
[00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:47.280]   his character, giving the Ten Commandments and the moral law. Oh, I'm like the author
[00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:52.120]   of the epistle to the Hebrews. Time would fail me to tell you all these great stories.
[00:46:52.120 --> 00:47:01.000]   David, the prophets Elijah and Mount Carmel, the great trial, 850 false prophets, one true
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:06.080]   prophet, Elijah, the man of God. And he challenges them, he said, 'The God that answereth by
[00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:14.520]   fire, let him be the God.' This is Christianity, a God who acts. The false prophets said they'd
[00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:20.520]   got a God, his name was Bel. Very well, said Elijah, we'll test our gods. We'll see which
[00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:27.480]   of them is God. He said, 'You kill a bullock and cut him in pieces, put the pieces on piles
[00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:36.560]   of wood on an altar, and then ask you a God, Bel, to send down fire to consume the offering.'
[00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:42.480]   And they began, the 850 of them. And Elijah was watching them, he knew the result before
[00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:48.840]   he began. And he went to them now and again, he said, 'Why doesn't he answer you?' And
[00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:52.160]   he went to them about midday, and he said, 'Look here, why doesn't your God answer you?
[00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:55.600]   Perhaps he's gone on a journey, or perhaps he's asleep and can't hear you. Shout a little
[00:47:55.600 --> 00:48:00.460]   bit more,' said Elijah to them. That's the way to deal with false prophets. Let them
[00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:09.760]   produce their God, let them show the results of their living God. Where is he? That's why
[00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:14.960]   chapels and churches are empty. They're not worshipping the true and living God, they're
[00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:20.600]   worshipping mere projections of their own great minds and philosophies. And you see,
[00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:24.600]   nothing happened, and they cut themselves with lancets, and they went into a frenzy
[00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:29.120]   because of their failure, but they failed completely. And then Elijah stepped quietly
[00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:35.560]   forward and he just offered a simple prayer to God. He said, 'O God, O Lord, let it be
[00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:44.240]   known in Israel this day that thou art God.' And God answered by fire. He's the living
[00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:50.080]   God, he's the acting God, he's the true God, he's the God who raised all the prophets.
[00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:57.160]   You know how the New Testament begins? It begins like this in a sense. 'In the fifteenth
[00:48:57.160 --> 00:49:02.520]   year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being the governor of Judea, Herod
[00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:10.640]   being the tetrarch of Abilene,' and so on. What happened? The word of God came to John,
[00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:15.920]   the son of Zacharias, in the wilderness. There had been no word for four hundred years since
[00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:20.160]   the prophet Malachi, and here is John the Baptist and he's in the wilderness. The word
[00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:28.320]   of God came to John. That's the whole story. It's all with God acting and sending his word.
[00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:33.640]   But my dear friends, the climax is this. When the fullness of the times had come, God sent
[00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:39.720]   forth his son, made of a woman, made under the law. God so loved the world that he gave
[00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:46.160]   his only begotten son, Jesus of Nazareth, is the son of God, sent into the world, appearing
[00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:56.120]   amongst men. God sending, God acting, it's all with God. And here he is starting the
[00:49:56.120 --> 00:50:02.800]   Christian church. 'And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord
[00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:09.600]   in one place. And there they would have remained until they died, were it not for this. Suddenly
[00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:16.240]   there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where
[00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:24.000]   they were sitting, and on and on he goes acting in them and through them.' And it is quite
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:31.160]   certain that you and I wouldn't be in this building at this moment were it not for the
[00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:37.200]   fact that God has continued to do that. Men in their blindness and sin have done their
[00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:42.200]   very best to ruin the Christian church. If she were ours, she would have finished long
[00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:47.640]   ago like many another institution. Men have misunderstood, they've gone wrong, they've
[00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:51.560]   preached error, and the church would have died and the world has persecuted. Why is
[00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:59.920]   there still a church? There's only one answer. God comes in revival. God sends his spirit
[00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:07.240]   again. Look at your Protestant Reformation. What was it? Well, God, as he sent his word
[00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:13.600]   to John the Baptist, sent it to Martin Luther. And when God sends his word even to one man
[00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:19.200]   and gives him power, he can turn over a great church with fifteen centuries of tradition
[00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:25.640]   behind her, which had become quite pagan in her teaching. One man, enough. Martin Luther
[00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:31.080]   called of God, given the message and filled with the spirit. And that's the story of every
[00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:36.040]   revival. For me to close, why does God act like this? He's a living God, he's an acting
[00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:43.040]   God. He's a God who sent this power, the sun, the rushing mighty wind. Why does he do it?
[00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:51.120]   You know the answer. It is for salvation. 'It shall come to pass that whosoever shall
[00:51:51.120 --> 00:52:00.280]   call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.' It isn't in order that we may have a nice
[00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:05.840]   formal service and have dignity on great national occasions. No, no. It's that we might be
[00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:12.760]   saved. And every man needs to be saved, however great, however illustrious. We are all sinners.
[00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:17.880]   We are all born in sin, shaped in iniquity. There is none righteous, no, not one. The
[00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:25.280]   wrath of God is on us all. We all need to be saved.
[00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:39.320]   All flesh is grass, and all the glory of man the flower of grass. The grass withereth and
[00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:50.200]   fadeth away. The greatest lose their faculties and their powers. The final illness and decay
[00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:58.880]   come, all go the same way. The burst of heraldry, the pump of power, and all the beauty, all
[00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:10.840]   that wealth there gave, awaits alike the inevitable hour. The paths of glory lead back to the
[00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:20.680]   grave. No, no, there's no hope in man. The only hope tonight is God is. And he's the
[00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:25.960]   living God. He's the acting God. He's the God who comes down. He's the God who offers
[00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:31.240]   salvation. He sent his only Son into the world, even to the cross, to die, his body to be
[00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:38.240]   broken, his blood to be shed. What for? That whosoever believeth in him should not perish,
[00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:46.320]   but have everlasting life. Oh, my dear friends, this is Christianity to tell you that you
[00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:52.080]   need to be saved, and that God has provided the means whereby you can be saved. It's
[00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:56.440]   all his action. And what is his action? Well, here's its character. I hope to work it
[00:53:56.440 --> 00:54:01.520]   out in greater detail with you later. It's a supernatural action. It's a miraculous
[00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:06.440]   action. I don't stand here to tell you to be good. I know you can't be. I don't
[00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:10.200]   tell you to go home and read books of philosophy in order that you may arrive at the knowledge
[00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:17.500]   of God and learn how to live. I know it's all useless. My message is to tell you that
[00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:22.960]   God has visited and redeemed his people. It's no use telling a man to pull himself
[00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:29.440]   together. It's the one thing we can't do. We are mastered by lusts and passions and
[00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:34.680]   evil desires. We are victims. We need to be delivered and thank God. It's a miraculous
[00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:39.880]   message. It's a supernatural message. It's of God. It's surprising. People say, "What
[00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:45.160]   meaneth this?" Of course, they can't understand. It's a powerful thing. It was a mighty rushing
[00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:52.160]   wind and it's a transforming power. It changes. It changed these men from being weak, frightened,
[00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:58.000]   alarmed, helpless, useless disciples. They become mighty men of God. Look at it all in
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:06.080]   the person of one man, the Apostle Peter. But above everything else, it's entirely
[00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:12.080]   beyond understanding. "What meaneth this?" they say. Of course, they do. If you can understand
[00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:16.440]   your religion, it's a proof it's not Christianity. If you are in control of your religion, it
[00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:20.560]   isn't Christianity. If it's not what you take up in a bag on Sunday morning and go
[00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:24.600]   to church and put down again, that's not Christianity. Christianity is a miracle. It's
[00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:29.920]   a marvel. It astonishes a man. He says, "What is this?" I don't understand. Even a Nicodemus
[00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:39.560]   puts the question. And that's all because it is the action of the living God. I quoted
[00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:44.520]   those great words of Blaise Pascal this morning. Let me quote them again. When he had that
[00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:50.160]   great experience of God, he said, "The God of Abram, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob."
[00:55:50.160 --> 00:56:00.740]   Then negatively, "Not the God of the philosophers and seers and thinkers." That's the contrast.
[00:56:00.740 --> 00:56:07.240]   It's the God who reveals himself in all the glory and the wonder of his miraculous eternal
[00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:13.320]   power. Oh, thank God for such a message, such a gospel. It made the church. It sent her
[00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:18.320]   on her career. This was the thing she preached. And men and women, 3,000 on the day of Pentecost,
[00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:23.880]   added to the church. Why? The message, the power of God behind it. Oh, we are going on
[00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:29.000]   to look into this. But this is my final word this evening. Because all this is true about
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:40.280]   it, it's a message for all. "Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved."
[00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:45.040]   You need to be a very clever man to understand these modern books about God. But thank God
[00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:50.160]   you don't need to be a very clever man to be a Christian. The common people heard him
[00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:57.800]   gladly. "Not many mighty, not many noble, not many wise are called," says the apostle
[00:56:57.800 --> 00:57:03.840]   Paul to the Corinthians. No, God has called the foolish things of the world to confound
[00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:09.920]   the wise, and the weak things of the world to confound those that are mighty. He has
[00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:15.360]   called things that are not to bring to naught things that are. There's a hope for all.
[00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:25.640]   You realize your need. Cry out unto him. Call unto the Lord, and you shall be saved.
[00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:31.960]   Be well, my friends. I leave you with just one simple question tonight. Is that your
[00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:41.520]   idea of Christianity? Do you know this living God, this true God, this acting God, this
[00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:47.800]   God who intervenes and comes? Have you ever met him in any shape or form, as Moses met
[00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:57.560]   him in the burning bush, as Jacob met him at Peniel, as Elijah met him on Mount Carmel?
[00:57:57.560 --> 00:58:05.680]   Have you ever felt the touch of God upon your soul? I don't see that you can be a Christian
[00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:13.280]   unless you have. Are you aware that you've been dealt with, that God has entered into
[00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:18.840]   your life and has done something that you couldn't do? Do you know that you are what
[00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:23.520]   you are by the grace of God? Have you got to say, "I can't explain. All I know is
[00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:28.400]   that God has done something to me in Christ. That's all I know." If you can say that,
[00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:36.080]   you're a Christian. But if all you've got is what you do and what you think, I'm afraid
[00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:46.120]   you're not a Christian. It needn't of necessity be the mighty rushing wind, but it is always
[00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:55.960]   the power of God. It is always the hand of God. It is the knowledge that God has seen
[00:58:55.960 --> 00:59:03.040]   you and has had pity upon you and has come down in the person of his Son even to enter
[00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:16.120]   into your life and to save you and set you free. Oh, that men and women might know the
[00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:29.040]   living God and his power unto salvation in Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
[00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:33.160]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones. All of
