[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480]   There's a lot of talk about his number, number 15, and you know, him and Carmelo Anthony.
[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.420]   I don't even know the whole story of what came out, but yeah, talk a little bit about
[00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:12.780]   your thoughts on that whole situation.
[00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.200]   Yeah, that's a funny one.
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:20.580]   I saw Melo was on something fairly recently and, you know, my first, it's interesting
[00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.040]   to think back because my first meeting when I was put in charge of the Nuggets in the
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:31.600]   summer of 2010 was to fly to Baltimore and sit in a hotel room where it was he, his agent,
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.320]   and one other guy that worked with him, and he asked to be traded.
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:41.840]   And they gave us two teams, and I put that in my back pocket, went back to Denver.
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.720]   I was kind of, our front office was in flux at the time, and then I wound up hiring a
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:53.720]   guy named Masai Ujiri, now runs the Toronto Raptors, and then he and I, and another person
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.760]   named Pete D'Alessandro worked on that trade for about six months.
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:05.120]   And so we got through the trade, and you know, you don't really think about much.
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:12.600]   You know, we had Allen Iverson for a number of years, and Ty Lawson wore number three.
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.060]   And so, you know, it's not anything that really ever crossed our mind.
[00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.240]   And so I was very surprised to hear Carmelo say that the other day because it wasn't something
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.240]   that ever crossed my mind.
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:29.800]   I think Nicola has worn number 15 his entire career, even when he was over in Europe.
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.440]   And so, you know, I mean, it wasn't something that really crossed our mind.
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.320]   And, you know, to have Nicola, I think, ascend to the level that he's at, maybe that might
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.400]   get under somebody's skin, I guess, perhaps, but I don't know.
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.400]   I think Nicola's always worn 15.
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.720]   It was never anything that we ever thought about, and, you know, I'm just happy that
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.560]   Nicola's on our team.
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.480]   What specifically was Melo upset about?
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.480]   Was it that someone else got to wear his number, his number didn't get retired?
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.640]   I'm not 100% sure.
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.840]   I think, you know, Melo, he had an unbelievable career with us, and he really put the Nuggets
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.240]   back on the map in a really positive way.
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:13.520]   I think that there was a, you know, it's interesting when a player wants to be traded from a team,
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:19.440]   and you know, that creates certain feelings, and it took a while for our fan base in Denver
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.840]   to get over that as well.
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.840]   It was an interesting scenario, because that whole saga really started the summer before,
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.400]   the summer of 2010.
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.140]   That was when LeBron had left Miami, or excuse me, left Cleveland to go to Miami, and so
[00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:42.240]   player empowerment and movement was really kind of just starting to reach its peak, and
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.240]   I think that's great.
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.120]   I think you guys have one shot at your careers.
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.640]   You know, we're kind of custodians of that career.
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.040]   We obviously have our own goals in trying to build our teams, but I always respect if
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.120]   somebody wants to go do something else, but for the city of Denver, I think they took
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.320]   it very personally, and that took a little time for the city to get over, and I'm sure
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.560]   Melo didn't like being booed for the first few times he came back, because he did.
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.640]   He worked his butt off for the city, and we had a great run in there.
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.440]   We made the Western Conference Finals in 2009.
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.600]   That was the only time we made it out of the first round, but I think over time, hopefully
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.600]   the feelings dissipate.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.040]   I think, you know, if he was to come back to Denver, I think he'd probably get a different
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.640]   reception these days, but from a personal level, there was never any animosity or anything
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:34.440]   kind of on our thinking about Nicola's number, because it was just the number that he wanted
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.480]   to wear and the number that he's worn forever.
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.320]   I think that it's been interesting to see his ascension to where he is, but, you know,
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:48.280]   to think that, for anyone to think that we gave a second round pick number 15, and knowing
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.600]   that it would someday turn into this, I think that's a pretty wild statement.
