[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.020]   If we don't ask how long do they last,
[00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:04.280]   but instead ask what's the probability
[00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.960]   that there have been any civilizations at all,
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.200]   no matter how long they lasted.
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.120]   I'm not asking whether they exist now or not,
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.020]   I'm just asking in general about probabilities
[00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.880]   to make a technological civilization
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.440]   anywhere and at any time in the history of the universe.
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.520]   And that we were able to constrain.
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.560]   And so what we found was basically
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:29.440]   that there have been 10 billion trillion
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.200]   habitable zone planets in the universe.
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.440]   And what that means is those are 10 billion trillion
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.440]   experiments that have been run.
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.080]   And the only way that we're the only time
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.720]   that this whole process from a biogenesis
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.280]   to a civilization has occurred
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.400]   is if every one of those experiments failed, right?
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.920]   So therefore you could put a probability,
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.000]   we call it the pessimism line, right?
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.840]   We don't really know what nature sets
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:59.960]   for the probability of making
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.560]   intelligent civilizations, right?
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.280]   But we could set a limit using this.
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.040]   We could say, look, if the probability
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.160]   per habitable zone planet is less than 10 to the minus 22,
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.720]   one in 10 billion trillion, then yeah, we're alone.
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.560]   If it's anywhere larger than that,
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.880]   then we're not the first.
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:16.960]   It's happened somewhere else.
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.360]   And to me, that was mind blowing.
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.000]   Doesn't tell me there's anybody nearby,
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.440]   the galaxy could be sterile.
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.440]   It just told me that unless nature's really against,
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.200]   has some bias against civilizations,
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.560]   we're not the first time this has happened.
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.080]   This has happened elsewhere
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.800]   over the course of cosmic history.
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.760]   - The following is a conversation with Adam Frank,
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.080]   an astrophysicist interested in the evolution
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.520]   of star systems and the search
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.940]   for alien civilizations in our universe.
[00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.020]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.960]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.200]   in the description.
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.800]   And now, dear friends, here's Adam Frank.
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.440]   You wrote a book about aliens.
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.360]   So the big question,
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.600]   how many alien civilizations are out there?
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.040]   - Yeah, that's the question, right?
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.040]   The amazing thing is that after two and a half millennia
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.820]   of people yelling at each other
[00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.640]   or setting each other on fire occasionally over the answer,
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.360]   we now actually have the capacity to answer that question.
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.960]   So in the next 10, 20, 30 years,
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.680]   we're gonna have data relevant
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.440]   to the answer to that question.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.920]   We're gonna have hard data finally
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.800]   that will, one way or the other,
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.780]   even if we don't find anything immediately,
[00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.760]   we will have gone through a number of planets.
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.440]   We'll be able to start putting limits on how common life is.
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.080]   The one answer I can tell you,
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.860]   which was an important part of the problem,
[00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.440]   is how many planets are there, right?
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.520]   And just like people have been arguing
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.280]   about the existence of life elsewhere for 2,500 years,
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.060]   people have been arguing about planets
[00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.800]   for the exact same amount of time, right?
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.240]   You can see Aristotle yelling at Democritus about this.
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.240]   You can see they had very wildly different opinions
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.400]   about how common planets were gonna be
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.080]   and how unique Earth was.
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.560]   And that question got answered, right?
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.680]   Which is pretty remarkable that in a lifetime
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.320]   you can have a 2,500-year-old question.
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.160]   The answer is they're everywhere.
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.520]   There are planets everywhere.
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.400]   And it was possible that planets were really rare.
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.560]   We didn't really understand how planets formed.
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.480]   And so if you go back to, say, the turn of the 20th century,
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.200]   there was a theory that said planets formed
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.960]   when two stars passed by each other closely
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.000]   and then material was gravitationally squeezed out,
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.720]   in which case those kinds of collisions are so rare
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.580]   that you would expect one in a trillion stars
[00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:38.420]   to have planets.
[00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.080]   Instead, every star in the night sky has planets.
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.840]   - So one of the things you've done
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.160]   is simulated the formation of stars.
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.720]   How difficult do you think it is to simulate
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.780]   the formation of planets, like simulate a solar system,
[00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.040]   through the entire evolution of the solar system?
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.240]   This is kind of a numerical simulation
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.680]   sneaking up to the question of how many planets are there.
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.240]   - That actually we're able to do now.
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.080]   There is, you can run simulations
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.560]   of the formation of planetary system.
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.040]   So if you run the simulation,
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.400]   really where you wanna start is a cloud of gas,
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.800]   these giant interstellar clouds of gas
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.560]   that may have a million times the mass of the sun in them.
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.600]   And so you run a simulation of that, it's turbulent,
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.680]   the gas is roiling and tumbling,
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.040]   and every now and then you get a place
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.160]   where the gas is dense enough that gravity gets hold of it
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.300]   and it can pull it downward.
[00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.720]   So you'll start to form a protostar.
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.040]   And a protostar is basically the young star,
[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.880]   this ball of gas where nuclear reactions are getting started
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.600]   but it's also a disk.
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.120]   So as material falls inward,
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.920]   because everything's rotating,
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.600]   as it falls inward, it'll spin up
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.120]   and then it'll form a disk.
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.840]   Material will collect in what's called an accretion disk
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.840]   or a protoplanetary disk.
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.080]   And you can simulate all of that.
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.920]   Once you get into the disk itself
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:58.800]   and you wanna do planets,
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.560]   things get a little bit more complicated
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.120]   'cause the physics gets more complicated.
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.960]   Now you gotta start worrying about dust
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.440]   'cause actually dust, which is just,
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.520]   dust is the wrong word, it's smoke really.
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.640]   These are the tiniest bits of solids.
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:15.240]   They will coagulate in the disk to form pebbles, right?
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.640]   And then the pebbles will collide to form rocks
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.880]   and then the rocks will form boulders, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.320]   That process is super complicated
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.560]   but we've been able to simulate enough of it
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.200]   to begin to get a handle on how planets form,
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.440]   how you accrete enough material
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.600]   to get the first protoplanets or planetary embryos,
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:36.440]   as we call them.
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.440]   And then the next step is those things
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.080]   start slamming into each other
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.960]   to form planetary-sized bodies.
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.880]   And then the planetary bodies slam into each other.
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.960]   Earth, the Moon came about
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.840]   because there was a Mars-sized body
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.120]   that slammed into the Earth
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.360]   and basically blew off all the material
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.440]   that then eventually formed the Moon.
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.220]   - And all of them have different chemical compositions,
[00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.460]   different temperatures?
[00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.840]   - Yeah, so the temperature of the material in the disk
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.160]   depends on how far away you are from the star.
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.520]   So it decreases, right?
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:09.840]   And so there's a really interesting point.
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.760]   So like, you know, close to the star,
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.400]   temperatures are really high.
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.560]   And the only thing that can condense,
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.080]   that can kind of freeze out,
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.360]   is gonna be stuff like metals.
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.360]   So that's why you find mercury
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.160]   is this giant ball of iron, basically.
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.860]   And then as you go further out, stuff,
[00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.320]   you know, the gas gets cooler
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.680]   and now you can start getting things like water to freeze.
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.000]   Right, so there's something we call the snow line,
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.680]   which is somewhere in our solar system
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.760]   out around between Mars and Jupiter.
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.920]   And that's the reason why the giant planets
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:42.680]   in our solar system, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune,
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:47.240]   all have huge amounts of ice in them, or water and ice.
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.440]   Actually, Jupiter and Saturn don't have so much,
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:50.280]   but the moons do.
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:51.920]   The moons have so much water in them
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.800]   that there's oceans, right?
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.420]   That we've got, a number of those moons
[00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:58.360]   have got more water on them than there's water on Earth.
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.920]   - Do you think it's possible to do that kind of simulation
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.360]   to have a stronger and stronger estimate
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.800]   of how likely an Earth-like planet is?
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.580]   Can we get the physics simulation done well enough
[00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:14.100]   to where we can start estimating,
[00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.680]   like what are the possible Earth-like things
[00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:17.840]   that could be generated?
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:18.940]   - Yeah, I think we can.
[00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.800]   I think we're learning how to do that now.
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.920]   So, you know, one part is like trying to just figure out
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:27.000]   how planets form themselves and doing the simulations.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.280]   Like that cascade from dust grains
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.440]   up to planetary embryos, that's hard to simulate
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.480]   because it's both, you got to do both the gas
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.320]   and you got to do the dust and the dust colliding
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.160]   and all that physics.
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.120]   Once you get up to a planet-sized body,
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.840]   then, you know, you kind of have to switch over
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:46.600]   to almost like a different kind of simulation.
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.320]   There, often what you're doing is you're doing,
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.060]   you know, sort of, you're assuming the planet
[00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:51.800]   is this sort of spherical ball,
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.400]   and then you're doing, you know, like a 1D,
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.400]   a radial calculation, and you're just asking like,
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.520]   all right, how is this thing going to,
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:58.980]   what is the structure of it going to be?
[00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:01.240]   Like, am I going to have a solid iron core,
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:02.920]   or am I going to get a solid iron core
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.160]   with that liquid iron core out around it,
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.480]   like we have on Earth?
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.520]   And then you get, you know, a silicate,
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:10.520]   kind of a rocky mantle, and then a crust,
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:13.520]   all of those details, those are kind of beyond
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:16.640]   being able to do full 3D simulations
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.640]   from ab initio, from scratch.
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:20.480]   We're not there yet.
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.880]   - How important are those details,
[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:23.920]   like the crust and the atmosphere, do you think?
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.000]   - Hugely important.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   So I'm part of a collaboration
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.120]   at the University of Rochester,
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.960]   where we're using the giant laser.
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:31.800]   It's literally, this is called
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.800]   the Laboratory for Laser Energetics.
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:37.360]   We got a huge grant from the NSF to use that laser
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.800]   to like slam tiny pieces of silica
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:43.040]   to understand what the conditions are like
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:44.280]   at, you know, the center of the Earth,
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:47.120]   or even more importantly, the center of super-Earths.
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.740]   Like the most common, this is what's wild,
[00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:51.720]   the most common kind of planet in the universe
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.600]   we don't have in our solar system,
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:54.840]   which is amazing, right?
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.840]   So the, we've been able to study enough,
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.760]   or observe enough planets now to get a census.
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:01.840]   You know, we pretty, you know,
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.500]   we kind of have an idea of what,
[00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:05.380]   who's average, who's weird.
[00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:07.000]   And our solar system's weird,
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.880]   because the average planet has a mass between,
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:12.680]   somewhere between a few times the mass of the Earth
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:16.180]   to maybe, you know, 10 times the mass of the Earth.
[00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:17.640]   And that's exactly where there are no planets
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:18.760]   in our solar system.
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:23.160]   So the smaller ones of those we call super-Earths,
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.840]   the larger ones we call sub-Neptunes.
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:26.860]   And they're anybody's guess.
[00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:29.160]   Like we don't really know what happens to material
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:30.920]   when you're squeezed to those pressures,
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:34.160]   which is like millions, tens of millions of times
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.600]   the pressure on the surface of the Earth.
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.320]   So those details really will matter
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.400]   of what's going on in there,
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.300]   because that will determine whether or not you have,
[00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:44.400]   say, for example, plate tectonics.
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.760]   We think plate tectonics may have been really important
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:47.720]   for life on Earth,
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:50.020]   for the evolution of complex life on Earth.
[00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:52.800]   So it turns out, and this is sort of the next generation
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.000]   where we're going with the understanding
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.940]   the evolution of planets in life.
[00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:59.540]   It turns out that you actually have to think hard
[00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:02.500]   about the planetary context for life.
[00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:05.000]   You can't just be like, oh, there's a warm pond, you know,
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.280]   and then some interesting, you know,
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:07.680]   chemistry happens in the warm pond.
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:10.560]   You actually have to think about the planet as a whole
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:13.320]   and what it's gone through in order to really understand
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:16.460]   whether a planet is a good place for life or not.
[00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:19.440]   - Why do you think plate tectonics might be useful
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.000]   for the formation of complex life?
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.560]   - There's a bunch of different things.
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:25.480]   One is that, you know, the Earth went through
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:28.160]   a couple of phases of being a snowball planet.
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.120]   Like we, you know, we went into a period of glaciation
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.600]   where the pretty much the entire planet was under ice.
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.200]   The oceans were frozen.
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.400]   You know, early on in Earth's history, there was no,
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.860]   there was barely any land.
[00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:41.800]   We were actually a water world, you know,
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:45.560]   with just a couple of Australia-sized cratons,
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.360]   they called them protocontinents.
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:50.920]   So those, we went through these snowball Earth phases.
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:52.080]   And if it wasn't for the fact
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:54.960]   that we had kind of an active plate tectonics,
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.360]   which had a lot of volcanism on it,
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.080]   we could have been locked in that forever.
[00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:00.840]   Like once you get into a snowball state,
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.800]   a planet can be trapped there forever,
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.960]   which is, you know, maybe you already had life form,
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:06.880]   but then because it's so cold,
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:10.240]   you may never get anything more than just microbes, right?
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:11.780]   So what plate tectonics does is it,
[00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:15.140]   because it fosters more volcanism,
[00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:16.800]   is that you're gonna get carbon dioxide
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.920]   pumped into the atmosphere, which warms the planet up
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:22.780]   and gets you out of the snowball Earth phase.
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:26.480]   But even more, there's even more really important things.
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.760]   I just finished a paper where we were looking
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:30.400]   at something called the hard steps model,
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:33.240]   which is this model that's been out there for a long time
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:36.300]   that purports to say intelligent life in the universe
[00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:37.800]   will be really rare.
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:40.280]   And it made all these assumptions about the Earth's history,
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:41.480]   particularly at the history of life
[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:42.400]   and the history of the planet
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:44.180]   or have nothing to do with each other.
[00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:47.120]   And it turns out, as I was doing the reading for this,
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:49.560]   that Earth probably early on
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:51.960]   had a more mild form of plate tectonics.
[00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:53.540]   And then somewhere about a billion years ago,
[00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:54.760]   it had ramped up.
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:57.440]   And that ramping up changed everything on the planet.
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.920]   'Cause here's a funny thing.
[00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:00.680]   The Earth used to be flat.
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:02.160]   What I mean by that, right?
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:03.360]   So all the flat earthers out there
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:04.840]   can get excited for one second.
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:05.680]   - Clip it.
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:06.720]   (laughing)
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:09.920]   - What I mean by that is that there really
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:12.200]   weren't many mountain ranges, right?
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.960]   The beginning of, I think the term is orogenesis,
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:18.400]   mountain building, the true Himalayan style giant mountains
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:21.360]   didn't happen until this more robust form
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:22.820]   of plate tectonics, where the plates
[00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:25.200]   are really being driven around the planet.
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.480]   And that is when you get the crusts hitting each other
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:29.200]   and they start pushing
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.960]   into these Himalayan style mountains.
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.840]   The weathering of that, the erosion of that
[00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.240]   puts huge amounts of nutrients,
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:39.240]   things that microbes wanna use into the oceans.
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.760]   And then the, what we call the net primary productivity,
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:45.040]   the bottom of the food chain,
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:47.160]   how much sugars they're producing,
[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.240]   how much photosynthesis they're doing,
[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:52.040]   shot up by a factor of almost a thousand, right?
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:54.720]   So that the fact that you had plate tectonics
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:57.720]   supercharged evolution in some sense.
[00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.840]   You know, like we're not exactly sure how it happened,
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:01.920]   but it's clear that the amount of life,
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:04.960]   the amount of living activity that was happening
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:06.840]   really got a boost from the fact
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:07.880]   that suddenly there was plate,
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:10.620]   this new vigorous form of plate tectonics.
[00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:14.760]   - So it's nice to have turmoil in terms of temperature,
[00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:18.000]   in terms of surface geometries,
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.400]   in terms of the chemistry of the planet, turmoil.
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:21.720]   - Yeah, that's actually really true
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:24.080]   because what happens is if you look at the history of life,
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.240]   that's a really, it's an excellent point you're bringing up.
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.460]   If you look at the history of life on earth,
[00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:31.120]   we get a biogenesis somewhere around
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.240]   at least 3.8 billion years ago.
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.320]   And that's the first microbes,
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.640]   they kind of take over enough that they really do,
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:38.000]   you get a biosphere, you get a biosphere
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.320]   that is actively changing the planet.
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.640]   But then you go through this period
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:43.320]   they call the boring billion,
[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:45.440]   where like it's a billion years and it's just microbes,
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:46.800]   nothing's happening, it's just microbes.
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:48.640]   I mean, microbes are doing amazing things,
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:52.640]   they're inventing fermentation, thank you very much.
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:53.680]   We appreciate that.
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:57.560]   But it's not until sort of you get probably
[00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:59.280]   these continents slamming into each other,
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:01.160]   you really get the beginning of continents forming
[00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:05.000]   and driving changes that evolution has to respond to,
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.080]   that on a planetary scale, this turmoil,
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.760]   this chaos is creating new niches
[00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:12.560]   as well as closing other ones.
[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:15.320]   And biology, evolution has to respond to that.
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.480]   And somewhere around there
[00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:18.120]   is when you get the Cambrian explosion,
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:20.320]   is when suddenly everybody plan,
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:23.880]   evolution goes on an orgy essentially.
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:27.360]   So yeah, it does look like that chaos
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:31.000]   or that turmoil was actually very helpful to evolution.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.720]   - I wonder if there's some extremely elevated levels
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:36.800]   of chaos, almost like catastrophes
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:39.160]   behind every leap of evolution.
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:40.840]   Like you're not gonna have leaps.
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:44.920]   Like in human societies, we have like an Einstein
[00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:46.960]   that comes up with a good idea,
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:49.800]   but it feels like on an evolutionary timescale,
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:54.160]   you need some real big drama going on
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.720]   for the evolutionary system to have to come up
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:58.160]   to a solution to that drama,
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:01.080]   like an extra complex solution to that drama.
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:02.640]   - Well, I think what's, I'm not sure if that's true.
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:03.480]   I don't know if it needs to be
[00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:05.880]   like an almost extinction event, right?
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:08.320]   'Cause it's certainly true that we have gone through
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:09.600]   almost extinction events, right?
[00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:13.160]   We've had five mass extinctions,
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:14.520]   but you don't necessarily see
[00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:17.640]   that like there was this giant evolutionary leap happening
[00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:18.480]   after those.
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:22.520]   So with the comet impact, the K-T boundary,
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:25.120]   certainly lots of niches opened up
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:26.120]   and that's why we're here, right?
[00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:29.440]   'Cause our ancestors were just little basically rodents,
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:32.880]   rats living under the footsteps of the dinosaurs.
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:37.240]   And it was that comet impact that opened the route for us.
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:39.800]   But it wasn't, I mean, that still took another
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:40.840]   65 million years.
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.880]   It wasn't like this thing immediately happened.
[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:44.760]   But what we found with this "Hard Steps" paper,
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:47.040]   'cause the whole idea of the "Hard Steps" paper was,
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:49.960]   it was one of these anthropic reasoning kinds of things
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:51.800]   where Brandon Carter said, "Oh, look,
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:54.440]   "the intelligence doesn't show up on earth
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:57.680]   "until about, you know, almost close to when
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:00.560]   "the end of the sun's lifetime."
[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:02.400]   And so he's like, "Well, there should be no reason
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:06.720]   "why the sun's lifetime and the time for evolution
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:09.920]   "to produce intelligence should be the same."
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:12.000]   And so therefore, and he goes through all this reasoning,
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.480]   anthropic reasoning, and he ends up with the idea
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:16.560]   that like, "Oh, it must be that the odds
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:20.360]   "of getting intelligence are super low."
[00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:21.520]   And so that's the "Hard Steps," right?
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.220]   So there was a series of steps in evolution
[00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:24.960]   that were, you know, very, very hard.
[00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:26.340]   And because of that, you can calculate
[00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:28.400]   some probability distributions.
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:30.780]   And everybody loves a good probability distribution,
[00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:32.440]   and they went a long way with this.
[00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:34.880]   But it turns out that the whole thing is flawed
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:37.560]   because on, you know, when you look at it,
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:40.640]   of course the timescale for the sun's evolution
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:43.480]   and the timescale for evolution on life are coupled
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:46.480]   because life and the timescale for evolution
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:49.560]   of the earth is coupled, is about the same timescale
[00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:50.600]   as the evolution of the sun.
[00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:51.440]   It's billions of years.
[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:53.720]   The earth evolves over billions of years.
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:56.000]   And life and the earth co-evolve.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.360]   That's what Brandon Carter didn't see,
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:59.480]   is that actually the fate of the earth
[00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:03.040]   and the fate of life are inextricably combined.
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:06.280]   And this is really important for astrobiology too.
[00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:09.520]   Life doesn't happen on a planet.
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:10.840]   It happens to a planet.
[00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:12.320]   So this is something that David Grinspoon
[00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:15.580]   and Sarah Walker both say, and you know, I agree with this.
[00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:18.080]   It's a really nice way of putting it.
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:23.080]   So, you know, plate tectonics, the evolution of oxygen,
[00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:26.200]   of an oxygen atmosphere, which only happened because of life.
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:29.760]   These things, you know, these are things
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:32.380]   that are happening where life and the planet
[00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:34.520]   are sort of sloshing back and forth.
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:36.680]   And so rather than to your point about,
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:38.400]   do you need giant catastrophes?
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:39.920]   Maybe not giant catastrophes,
[00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:42.160]   but what happens is as the earth and life
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.640]   are evolving together, windows are opening up,
[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:46.240]   evolutionary windows.
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:49.560]   Like for example, life put oxygen into the atmosphere.
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:52.400]   When life invented this new form of photosynthesis
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.500]   about two and a half billion years ago,
[00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:56.780]   that broke water apart to, you know,
[00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:59.960]   work to do its chemical shenanigans,
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:03.480]   it broke water apart and pushed oxygen into the atmosphere.
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:05.240]   That's why there's oxygen in the atmosphere.
[00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:07.080]   It's only 'cause of life.
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:09.440]   That opened up huge possibilities,
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:12.120]   new spaces for evolution to happen.
[00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:14.840]   But it also changed the chemistry of the planet forever.
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:18.980]   So the introduction of oxygen photosynthesis
[00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:20.400]   changed the planet forever.
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:23.520]   And it opened up a bunch of windows for evolution
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:24.680]   that wouldn't have happened otherwise.
[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:26.680]   Like for example, you and I,
[00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:29.200]   we need that amount of oxygen.
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:32.320]   Big brained creatures need an oxygen rich atmosphere
[00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:35.640]   'cause oxygen is so potent for metabolism.
[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:38.040]   So you couldn't get intelligent creatures
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:41.400]   a hundred million years after the planet formed.
[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:43.760]   - So really on a scale of a planet
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:48.440]   when there's billions, trillions of organisms on a planet,
[00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:51.960]   they can actually have planetary scale impact.
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.880]   - Yeah.
[00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:55.720]   - So the chemical shenanigans of an individual organism
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:59.160]   when scaled out to trillions can actually change a planet.
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:01.000]   - Yeah, and we know this for a fact now.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.320]   Like this is, so there was this thing Gaia theory
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:06.760]   that was James Lovelock introduced in the 70s.
[00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:08.160]   And then Lynn Margulis,
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.680]   the biologist Lynn Margulis together.
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:12.080]   So this Gaia theory was the idea
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:14.400]   that planets pretty much take,
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:16.120]   or sorry, life takes over a planet.
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:18.560]   Life hijacks a planet in a way
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:22.960]   that the sum total of life creates these feedbacks
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:24.920]   between the planet and the life
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:27.640]   such that it keeps the planet habitable.
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:29.280]   It's kind of a homeostasis, right?
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:30.840]   I can go out like right now outside,
[00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:32.160]   it's a hundred degrees, right?
[00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:33.840]   And I go outside, but my internal temperature
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:34.720]   is gonna be the same.
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:37.480]   And I can go back to Rochester, New York in the winter,
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:39.520]   and it's gonna be zero degrees,
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:41.360]   but my internal temperature is gonna be the same.
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:42.680]   That's homeostasis.
[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:45.040]   The idea of Gaia theory was that life,
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:48.560]   the biosphere exerts this pressure on the planet
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:50.160]   or these feedbacks on the planet
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:52.480]   that even as other things are changing,
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:54.640]   the planet will always stay in the right kinds
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:56.000]   of conditions for life.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.280]   And now when this theory came out,
[00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:58.360]   it was very controversial.
[00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:01.120]   People were like, "Oh my God, what are you smoking weed?"
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:03.760]   You know, and like, there were all these Gaian festivals
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:05.840]   with Gaian dances.
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.440]   And so, you know, it became very popular
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.200]   in the new age community.
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:11.000]   But Lovelock, actually, they were able to show
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:11.960]   that no, this has nothing to do
[00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:14.520]   with like the planet being conscious or anything.
[00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:18.280]   It was about these feedbacks that by the biology,
[00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:20.200]   the biosphere can exert these feedbacks.
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:22.320]   And now that's become, whether or not it's still,
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:25.080]   we're still unclear whether there are true Gaian feedbacks
[00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:26.160]   in the sense that the planet
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:28.640]   can really exert complete control.
[00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:32.120]   But it is absolutely true that the biosphere
[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:35.040]   is a major player in Earth's history.
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:38.360]   - So the biosphere fights for homeostasis on Earth?
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:40.260]   - The biosphere, so, okay, what I would say right now
[00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:42.180]   is I don't know if I can say that scientifically.
[00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:45.560]   I can certainly say that the biosphere does a huge amount
[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:48.880]   of the regulation of the planetary state.
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:52.640]   And over billions of years has strongly modified
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:53.740]   the evolution of the planet.
[00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:55.840]   So whether or not a true Gaian feedback
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:57.520]   would be exactly what you said, right?
[00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:59.680]   The biosphere is this somehow,
[00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:01.200]   and Sarah Walker and David Grinspoon
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.360]   and I actually did a paper on this
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:04.960]   about the idea of planetary intelligence
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:08.280]   or cognition across a planetary scale.
[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:09.680]   And I think that actually is possible.
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:10.660]   It's not conscious,
[00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:13.400]   but there is a kind of cognitive activity going on.
[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:16.960]   The biosphere in some sense knows what is happening
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:19.080]   because of these feedbacks.
[00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:20.640]   So it's still unclear whether we have
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:22.060]   these full Gaian feedbacks,
[00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:24.680]   but we certainly have semi-Gaian feedbacks.
[00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:27.680]   If there's a perturbation on the planetary scale,
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:29.680]   temperature, you know, insulation,
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:31.160]   how much sunlight's coming in,
[00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:33.500]   the biosphere will start to have feedbacks
[00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:35.640]   that will damp that perturbation.
[00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:37.840]   Temperature goes up, the biosphere starts doing something,
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:39.220]   temperature comes down.
[00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:43.040]   - Now I wonder if the technosphere also has a Gaian feedback
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:45.000]   or elements of a Gaian feedback
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.760]   such that the technosphere will also fight
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:49.720]   to some degree for homeostasis.
[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:50.960]   Open question, I guess.
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:52.880]   - Well, that's, I'm glad you asked that question
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:56.680]   because that paper that David and Sarah and I wrote,
[00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:57.980]   what we were arguing was,
[00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:00.920]   is that over the history of a planet, right,
[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:03.880]   when life first forms, you know, 3.8 billion years ago,
[00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:05.600]   it's kind of thin on the ground, right?
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:07.840]   You've got the first species, you know,
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:09.040]   these are all microbes.
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:10.760]   And they have not yet,
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:13.920]   they're not gonna, enough of them to exert
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:15.920]   any kind of these Gaian feedbacks.
[00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:18.960]   So we call that an immature biosphere.
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:21.520]   But then as time goes on, as life becomes more robust
[00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:24.160]   and it begins to exert these feedbacks,
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:25.560]   keeping the planet in the place
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:26.720]   where it needs to be for life,
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:29.360]   we call that a mature biosphere, right?
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:30.520]   And the important thing, and we're gonna,
[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:32.280]   I'm sure later on, we're gonna talk about definitions
[00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:33.360]   of life and such.
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:36.280]   There's this great term called autopoiesis
[00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:38.800]   that Francisco Varela, the neurobiologist,
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:40.440]   Francisco Varela came up with.
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:41.880]   And he said, you know, one of the defining things
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:44.160]   about life is this property of autopoiesis,
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:47.440]   which means self-creating and self-maintaining.
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:50.360]   Life does not create the conditions
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:52.360]   which will destroy itself, right?
[00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:54.680]   It's always trying to keep itself in a place
[00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:56.560]   where it can stay alive.
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:59.480]   So the biosphere, from this Gaian perspective,
[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:02.720]   has been autopoietic for, you know, billions of years.
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:04.880]   Now we just invented this technosphere
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:07.800]   in the last, you know, couple of hundred years.
[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:09.240]   And what we were arguing in that paper
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:11.760]   is that it's an immature technosphere, right?
[00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:13.040]   'Cause right now with climate change
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:14.400]   and all the other things we're doing,
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:16.360]   we don't, we're, the technosphere right now
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:18.160]   is sort of destroying the conditions
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:21.400]   under which it needs to maintain itself.
[00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:25.040]   So the real job for us, if we're gonna last over,
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:26.880]   you know, geologic timescales,
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:29.240]   if we want a technosphere that's gonna last
[00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:31.360]   tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands,
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:34.080]   millions of years, then we've gotta become mature,
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:37.640]   which means to not undermine the conditions,
[00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:41.160]   to not subvert the conditions that you need to stay alive.
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:44.640]   So as of right now, I'd say we're not autopoietic.
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:48.720]   - Well, I wonder if we look across thousands,
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:51.400]   tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of years,
[00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:54.320]   that perturbations, the technosphere
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:58.920]   should create perturbations as a way
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:01.200]   for developing greater and greater defenses
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:03.440]   against perturbations,
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:05.320]   which sounds like a ridiculous statement,
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:08.720]   but basically go out and play in the yard
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:11.520]   and hurt yourself to strengthen the,
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:13.800]   or like drink water from the pond.
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:16.640]   - From the pond, yeah, right, get sick a few times.
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:18.200]   - To strengthen the immune system.
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:19.640]   - Yeah, well, you know, it's interesting
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:21.560]   with the technosphere, we could talk about this more,
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:25.000]   but like, you know, we're just emerging as a technosphere
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.080]   in terms of as a interplanetary technosphere, right?
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:29.400]   That's really the next step for us,
[00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:31.400]   is to, David Grinspoon talks about,
[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:33.200]   I love this idea of anti-accretion,
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:35.840]   like this amazing thing that for the first time,
[00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:37.600]   you know, over the entire history of the planet,
[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:39.880]   stuff is coming off the planet, right?
[00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:41.320]   Used to be everything just fell down,
[00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:42.920]   all the meteorites fell down,
[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:45.120]   but now we're starting to push stuff out.
[00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:47.960]   And, you know, like the idea of planetary defense or such,
[00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:51.760]   you know, we are actually gonna start exerting perturbations
[00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:53.760]   on the solar system as a whole.
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:55.640]   We're gonna start engineering if we make it, right?
[00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:56.760]   I always like to say that if we can get
[00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:57.640]   through climate change,
[00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:00.920]   the prize at the end is the solar system, right?
[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:05.880]   So we will be changed, literally engineering
[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:07.760]   the solar system, but what you can think of right now
[00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:09.840]   with what's happening with the Anthropocene,
[00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:14.480]   the great acceleration that is the technosphere,
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:15.520]   you know, is the creation,
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:18.440]   that is a giant perturbation on the biosphere, right?
[00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:21.240]   And what you can't do is, you know,
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:23.920]   the technosphere sits on top of the biosphere,
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:28.280]   and if the technosphere undermines the biosphere
[00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:31.040]   for its own conditions of habitability,
[00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:32.160]   then you're in trouble, right?
[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:33.280]   I mean, the biosphere is not going away.
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:34.320]   There's nothing we could do.
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:36.320]   Like the idea that we have to save the earth
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:37.360]   is a little ridiculous.
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:38.880]   Like the earth is not a furry little bunny
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:40.160]   that we need to protect,
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:42.000]   but it's the conditions for us, right?
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.160]   We, humanity emerged out of the Holocene,
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:47.440]   the last 10,000 years interglacial period.
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:51.080]   We can't tolerate very different kinds of earths.
[00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:53.720]   So that's what I mean about a perturbation.
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:55.920]   - Before we forget, I gotta ask you about this paper.
[00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:57.320]   - Right. - Pretty interesting.
[00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:00.000]   There's an interesting table here about hard steps.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.880]   Abiogenesis, glucose fermentation,
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:05.360]   2-peruvic acid, all kinds of steps,
[00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:08.320]   all the way to homo sapiens, animal intelligence,
[00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:11.800]   land ecosystems, endoskeletons, eye precursor.
[00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:13.640]   So formation of the eye. - Yeah.
[00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:17.400]   - Complex multicellularity.
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:18.880]   - That's definitely one of the big ones.
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:20.080]   - Yeah, so interesting.
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:21.480]   I mean, what can you say about this chart?
[00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:24.440]   There are all kinds of papers talking about
[00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:26.360]   what the difficulty of these steps.
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:27.520]   - Right, and so this was the idea.
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:31.000]   So what Carter said was, using anthropic reasoning,
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   he said there must be a few very hard steps
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.520]   for evolution to get through to make it to intelligence.
[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:41.520]   Right, so there's some steps are gonna be easy.
[00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:43.960]   So every generation, you know, you roll the dice
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:47.160]   and yeah, it won't take long for you to get that step.
[00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:48.480]   But there must be a few of them.
[00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:49.920]   And he said you could even calculate what,
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:52.480]   how many there were, five, six,
[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:54.000]   in order to get to intelligence.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.960]   And so this paper here, this plot,
[00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:57.000]   is all these different people
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.120]   who've written all these papers.
[00:26:58.120 --> 00:26:59.040]   And this is the point, actually,
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:00.080]   you can see all these papers
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:01.840]   that were written on the hard steps.
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:04.360]   Each one proposing a different set
[00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:06.520]   of what those steps should be.
[00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:08.280]   And there's this other idea from biology
[00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:11.360]   of the major transitions in evolution, MTEs,
[00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:13.040]   that those were the hard steps.
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:14.960]   But what we actually found was
[00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:17.160]   that none of those are actually hard.
[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:18.760]   The whole idea of hard steps,
[00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:21.680]   that there are hard steps, is actually suspect.
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:24.040]   So, you know, what's amazing about this model
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:26.360]   is it shows how important it is
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:29.280]   to actually work with people who are in the field, right?
[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:31.480]   So, you know, Brandon Carter was a brilliant physicist,
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:33.160]   the guy who came up with this.
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:36.680]   And then lots of physicists and astrophysicists like me
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:40.720]   have used this, but the people who actually study evolution
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:43.400]   and the planet were never involved, right?
[00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:46.040]   And if you went and talked to an evolutionary biologist
[00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:48.640]   or a biogeophysicist, they'd look at you,
[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:49.480]   when you explained this to them,
[00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:50.960]   and they'd be like, what?
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:53.360]   Like, what are you guys doing?
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:57.160]   Turns out none of the details,
[00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:00.520]   or none of the conceptual structure of this
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:04.520]   matches with what the people actually study
[00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:06.120]   the planet and its evolution.
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:07.960]   - Is it mostly about the fact that
[00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:10.480]   there's not really discrete big steps?
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:12.680]   Is this a gradual, continual kind of process?
[00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:13.520]   - Well, there's two things.
[00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:15.120]   The first most important one was that
[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:17.520]   the planet and the biosphere have evolved together.
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:19.320]   That's something that every, you know,
[00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:22.360]   most biogeophysicists completely accept.
[00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:24.720]   And it was the first thing that Carter kind of rejected.
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:26.720]   He said, like, no, that's probably not possible.
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:28.360]   And yet, you know, like if he'd only sort of
[00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:30.760]   had more discussions with this other community,
[00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:32.720]   it would've seemed like, no, there are actually
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:34.000]   windows that open up.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.320]   And then the next thing is this idea
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:37.640]   of whether a step is hard or not.
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:40.360]   'Cause for hard, what we mean by a hard step
[00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:42.480]   is that, like I said, every time there's a generation,
[00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:44.400]   every time there's a next generation born,
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:47.400]   you're rolling the dice on whether this mutation will happen.
[00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:50.600]   And the idea of something being a hard step,
[00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:52.960]   there's two ways in which something might even appear
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:54.600]   as a hard step and not be,
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.320]   or actually not be a hard step at all.
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:58.320]   One is that you see something that has occurred
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:00.800]   in evolution that's only happened once, right?
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:02.520]   So let's take the opposite.
[00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:04.360]   We see something that's happened multiple times,
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:06.960]   like wings, lots of examples of wings
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:09.400]   over lots of different evolutionary lineages.
[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:10.240]   So that's clearly not a hard,
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:12.360]   making wings is not a hard step.
[00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:13.520]   There are certain other things that people say,
[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:15.720]   no, that's a hard step, oxygen, you know,
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:18.800]   the oxygen photosynthesis.
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:22.240]   But they are so, they tend to be so long ago
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:23.520]   that we've lost all the information.
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:26.280]   There could be other things in the fossil record
[00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:29.560]   that, you know, went, made this innovation,
[00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:30.520]   but they're just gone now.
[00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:31.360]   So you can't tell.
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:32.640]   So there's information loss.
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:34.920]   The other thing is the idea of pulling up the ladder
[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:38.360]   that somebody, you know, some species makes the innovation,
[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:40.920]   but then it fills the niche and nobody else can do it again.
[00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:42.080]   So yeah, it only happened once,
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:43.560]   but it happened once because basically
[00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:46.920]   the creature was so successful, it took over
[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:49.800]   and there was no space for anybody else to evolve it.
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:51.400]   So yeah, so the interesting thing about this
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:55.920]   was seeing how much, once you look at the details
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:57.720]   of life's history on earth,
[00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:01.440]   how it really shifts you away from this hard steps model.
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:02.800]   And it shows you that those details,
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:03.840]   as we were talking about like,
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:04.920]   do you have to know about the planet?
[00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:06.520]   Do you have to know about plate tectonics?
[00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:08.960]   Yeah, you're going to have to.
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:11.760]   - I mean, to be fair to Carter on the first point,
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:15.080]   it makes it much more complicated
[00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:18.520]   if life and the planet are co-evolving.
[00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:20.720]   Because it would be nice to consider the planet
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:24.360]   as a static thing that sets the initial conditions.
[00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:26.640]   And then we can sort of, from an outside perspective,
[00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:30.800]   analyze planets based on the initial conditions they create.
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:35.240]   And then there's a binary yes or no, will it create life?
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:37.040]   But if they co-evolve, it's just like a,
[00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:39.320]   it's a really complex dynamical system
[00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:43.720]   where everything is, because it's much more difficult
[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:45.160]   from the perspective of SETI,
[00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:47.560]   of looking out there and trying to figure out
[00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:50.820]   which ones are actually producing life.
[00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:51.900]   - But I think we're at the point now,
[00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:54.240]   so now there may be other kinds of principles
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:56.280]   that actually, 'cause co-evolution actually
[00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:58.320]   has its own, not deterministic,
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:00.020]   you're done with determinism, right?
[00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:03.280]   But complex systems have patterns,
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:05.560]   complex systems have constraints.
[00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:07.520]   And that's actually what we're going to be looking for,
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:09.960]   are constraints on them.
[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:11.400]   And so, and again, nothing against Carter,
[00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:14.000]   it was a brilliant idea, but it just goes to show,
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.720]   there's this great, I'm a theoretical physicist, right?
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:20.040]   And so I love simplified, give me a simplified model
[00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:23.120]   with a dynamical equation, some initial conditions,
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:24.200]   I'm very happy.
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:26.200]   But there's this great XDC comic where like,
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:27.800]   somebody's working something out on the board
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:30.080]   and this physicist is looking over and saying,
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:32.560]   "Oh, oh, I just wrote down an equation for that.
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:33.640]   "I solved your problem.
[00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:35.280]   "Do you guys even have a journal for this?"
[00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:38.480]   And the subtitle is "Why Everybody Hates Physicists."
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:40.680]   So sometimes that approach totally works.
[00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:43.440]   Sometimes physicists can be very good at like zooming in
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:47.140]   on what is important and casting the details aside
[00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:48.400]   so you can get to the heart of an issue.
[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:51.680]   And that's very useful sometimes.
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:53.600]   Other times it obfuscates, right?
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:56.240]   Other times it clouds over actually
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:58.640]   what you needed to focus on,
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:00.600]   especially when it comes to complexity.
[00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:05.120]   - Speaking of simplifying everything down to an equation,
[00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:07.560]   let's return back to the question
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:09.920]   of how many alien civilizations are out there
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:12.400]   and talk about the Drake equation.
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:15.320]   Can you explain the Drake equation?
[00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:17.240]   - You know, people have various feelings
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:18.880]   about the Drake equation.
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:21.720]   You know, it can be abused, but basically it was,
[00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:23.560]   the story actually is really interesting.
[00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:26.040]   So Frank Drake in 1960
[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:28.680]   does the first ever astrobiological experiment.
[00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:31.600]   He gets a radio telescope, points it at a couple of stars
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:33.080]   and listens for signals.
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:35.720]   That was the first time anybody done any experiment
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:39.360]   about any kind of life in the history of humanity.
[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:40.800]   And he does it and he's kind of waiting for everybody
[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:41.640]   to make fun of him.
[00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:43.480]   And still he gets a phone call from the government,
[00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:46.640]   says, "Hey, we want you to do a meeting
[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:49.680]   "on interstellar communications," right?
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:50.800]   So he's like, "Okay."
[00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:53.800]   So they organize a meeting with like just eight people.
[00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:56.280]   A young Carl Sagan is gonna be there as well.
[00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:58.640]   And like the night before,
[00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:01.840]   Drake has to come up with an agenda.
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:03.760]   How do you come up with an agenda
[00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:04.800]   for a meeting on a topic
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:07.280]   that no one's ever talked about before, right?
[00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:09.040]   And so he actually, he breaks what he does,
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:10.760]   what's so brilliant about the Drake equation
[00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:12.680]   is he breaks the problem
[00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:15.320]   of how many civilizations are out there
[00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:17.480]   into a bunch of sub-problems, right?
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:20.160]   And he breaks it into seven sub-problems,
[00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:23.520]   each one of them is a factor in an equation
[00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:24.840]   that when you multiply them all together,
[00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:27.120]   you get the number of civilizations out there
[00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:28.760]   that we could communicate with.
[00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:32.800]   So the first term is the rate at which stars form.
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:34.860]   The second term is the fraction of those stars
[00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:36.800]   that have planets, F sub P.
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:38.760]   The next term is the number of planets
[00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:39.960]   in the habitable zone,
[00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:42.520]   the place where we think life could form.
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:45.800]   The next term after that is the fraction of those planets
[00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:50.280]   where actually an abiogenesis event, life forms, occurs.
[00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:52.720]   The next one is the fraction of planets
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:56.080]   on which you start to get intelligence.
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:58.760]   After that, it's the fraction of planets
[00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:01.760]   where that intelligence goes on to create a civilization.
[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:03.360]   And then finally, the last term,
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:05.100]   which is the one that we really care about,
[00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:06.000]   is the lifetime.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.200]   How long, you have a civilization,
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:08.120]   now how long does it last?
[00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:09.560]   - Well, you say we humans.
[00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:10.400]   - We humans, right?
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:12.400]   'Cause we're standing, we're staring at the,
[00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:14.200]   multiple guns pointing at us,
[00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:17.680]   nuclear war, climate change, AI.
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:20.320]   So, how long in general does civilizations last?
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:21.560]   Now, each one of these terms,
[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:23.400]   what was brilliant about what he did was,
[00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:26.320]   what he was doing was he was quantifying our ignorance,
[00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:27.840]   right, by breaking the problem up
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:29.320]   into these seven sub-problems,
[00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:31.320]   he gave astronomers something to do, right?
[00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:33.680]   And so, this is always with a new research field,
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:35.160]   you need a research program,
[00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:36.860]   or else you just have a bunch of vague questions,
[00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:40.520]   you don't even know really what you're trying to do.
[00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:42.560]   So, the star people could figure out
[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:44.040]   how many stars were forming per year,
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:45.720]   the people who were interested in planets
[00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:48.960]   could go out and find techniques to discover planets,
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:50.200]   et cetera, et cetera.
[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:53.080]   - I mean, these are their own fields.
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:54.880]   Essentially, by creating this equation,
[00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:56.480]   he's launching new fields.
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:59.160]   - Yeah, that's exactly, he gave astrobiology,
[00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:01.720]   which wasn't even a term then, a roadmap.
[00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:03.200]   Like, okay, you guys go do this,
[00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:04.680]   you go do that, you go do that,
[00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:09.160]   and it had such far-reaching effect on astrobiology,
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:10.760]   because it did break the problem up
[00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:15.760]   in a way that gave useful sort of marching orders
[00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:16.920]   for all these different groups.
[00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:19.320]   Like, for example, it's because of the Drake equation,
[00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:23.520]   in some sense, that people who were involved in SETI
[00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:27.520]   pushed NASA to develop the technologies for planet hunting.
[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:30.640]   There was this amazing meeting in 1978 and '92 meetings,
[00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:34.280]   1978 and 1979, that were driven in some part
[00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:36.400]   by the people who were involved in SETI
[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:37.760]   getting NASA together to say,
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:40.720]   look, okay, look, what's the roadmap for us
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:44.080]   to develop technologies to find planets?
[00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:46.520]   So yeah, so the Drake equation
[00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:51.280]   is absolutely foundational for astrobiology,
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:54.640]   but we should remember that it's not a law of nature.
[00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:57.400]   It's not something that's, it's not E equals MC squared.
[00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:59.760]   And so you can see it being abused in some sense.
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:01.640]   People, it's generated a trillion papers.
[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:04.120]   Some of those papers are good, I've written some of those,
[00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:06.160]   and some of those papers are bad.
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:07.880]   I'm not sure where my paper fits in on those,
[00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:09.920]   but I'm just saying, one should be careful
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:11.120]   about what you're using it for.
[00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:14.440]   But in terms of understanding the problem
[00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:16.640]   that astrobiology faces,
[00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:19.440]   this really broke it up in a useful way.
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:21.800]   - We could talk about each one of these,
[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:25.000]   but let's just look at exoplanets.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.600]   So that's a really interesting one.
[00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:30.520]   I think when you look back hundreds of years from now,
[00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:32.400]   what is it, in the '90s, when they first detected the first?
[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:35.040]   - '92 and '95, '95 to me was really,
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:37.200]   that was the discovery of the first planet
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:38.480]   orbiting a sun-like star.
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:40.920]   To me, that was the water, the dam being broken.
[00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:43.800]   - I think that's one of the greatest discoveries
[00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:45.320]   in the history of science.
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:46.680]   - I agree, I agree.
[00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:49.680]   - Right now, I guess nobody's celebrating it too much
[00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:53.160]   because you don't know what it really means.
[00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:55.600]   But I think once we almost certainly
[00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:57.440]   will find life out there,
[00:36:57.440 --> 00:37:01.200]   it will obviously allow us to generalize
[00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:04.960]   across the entire galaxy, the entire universe.
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:07.240]   So if you can find life on a planet,
[00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:08.920]   even in the solar system,
[00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:12.560]   you can now start generalizing across the entire universe.
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:13.400]   - You can.
[00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:14.240]   All you need is one, like right now,
[00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:16.560]   it's an, you know, our understanding of life,
[00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:17.480]   we have one example.
[00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:20.120]   We have N equals one example of life.
[00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:22.160]   So that means we could be an accident, right?
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:23.720]   It could be that we're the only place
[00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:26.980]   in the entire universe where this weird thing
[00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:28.480]   called life has occurred.
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:30.460]   Get one more example, and now you're done.
[00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:31.680]   Because if you have one more example,
[00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:33.200]   now you're, you know, you don't have to find
[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:34.020]   all the other examples.
[00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:35.880]   You just know that it's happened more than once.
[00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:39.440]   And now you are, you know, from a Bayesian perspective,
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:40.840]   you can start thinking like, yeah, yeah, yeah,
[00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:43.200]   this life is not something that's hard to make.
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:46.000]   - Well, let me get your sense of estimates
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:46.960]   for the Drake equation.
[00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:48.560]   You've also written a paper expanding
[00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:51.960]   on the Drake equation, but what do you think is the answer?
[00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:53.800]   - So the paper, there was this paper we wrote,
[00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:56.760]   Woody Sullivan and I, in 2016, where we said,
[00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:59.240]   look, we have all this exoplanet data now, right?
[00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:01.680]   So the thing that exoplanet science
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:04.580]   and the exoplanet census I was talking about before
[00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:08.340]   have nailed is F sub P, the fraction of stars
[00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:10.340]   that have planets, it's one.
[00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:13.540]   Every fricking star that you see in the sky
[00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:15.440]   hosts a family of worlds.
[00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:17.220]   I mean, it's mind boggling.
[00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:20.540]   'Cause every one of those, those are all places, right?
[00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:23.660]   They're either, you know, gas giants, probably with moons.
[00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:26.240]   So the moons are places you can stand and look out.
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:27.740]   Or they're like terrestrial worlds
[00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:28.820]   where even if there's not life,
[00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:31.520]   there's still snow falling and there's oceans
[00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:33.800]   washing up on, you know, on shorelines.
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:36.960]   It's incredible to think how many places
[00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:39.020]   and stories there are out there.
[00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:40.640]   So right, the first term was F sub P,
[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:42.720]   which is how many stars have planets.
[00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:45.140]   The next term is how many planets
[00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:47.800]   are in the habitable zone, right, on average.
[00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:50.360]   And it turns out to be one over five, right?
[00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:52.040]   So, you know, around 0.2.
[00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:53.160]   So that means you just count five of them,
[00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:55.120]   go out at night and go one, two, three, four, five.
[00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:58.280]   One of them has an Earth-like planet, you know,
[00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:00.620]   in the habitable zone, like, whoa.
[00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:02.400]   - So what defines a habitable zone?
[00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:06.100]   - Habitable zone is an idea that was developed
[00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:11.100]   in the 1958 by the Chinese-American astronomer Xu Shang.
[00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:12.620]   And it was a brilliant idea.
[00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:14.640]   It said, look, this is there, you know,
[00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:16.400]   I can do this simple calculation.
[00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:18.360]   If I take a planet and just stick it
[00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:20.160]   at some distance from a star
[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:22.380]   of what's the temperature of the planet?
[00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:23.860]   What's the temperature of the surface?
[00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:24.880]   So now you're all, you're gonna ask,
[00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:26.240]   you give it a standard kind of, you know,
[00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:28.000]   Earth-like atmosphere and ask,
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.080]   could there be liquid water on the surface, right?
[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:33.200]   We believe that liquid water is really important for life.
[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:35.000]   There could be other things that's happening, fine.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.800]   But, you know, if you were to start off trying to make life,
[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:41.280]   you'd probably choose water as your solvent for it.
[00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:45.360]   So basically the habitable zone is the band of orbits
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:49.080]   around a star where you can have liquid water on the surface.
[00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:50.360]   You could take a glass of water,
[00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:51.960]   pour it on the surface and it would just pool up.
[00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:53.520]   It wouldn't freeze immediately,
[00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:55.320]   which would happen if your planet is too far out.
[00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:56.880]   And it wouldn't just boil away
[00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:58.320]   if your planet's too close in.
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:01.800]   So that's the formal definition of the habitable zone.
[00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:03.640]   So it's a nice, strict definition.
[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:05.520]   There's probably way more going on than that,
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:07.120]   but this is a place to start.
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:09.680]   - Right, well, we should say it's a place to start.
[00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:11.920]   I do think it's too strict of a constraint.
[00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:12.760]   - I would agree.
[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:15.560]   - We're talking about temperature
[00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:18.280]   where water can be on the surface.
[00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:23.280]   There's so many other ways to get the aforementioned turmoil
[00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:26.760]   where the temperature varies, whether it's volcanic.
[00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:29.160]   So interaction of volcanoes and ice
[00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:31.320]   and all of this on the moons of plants
[00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:33.520]   that are much farther away, all this kind of stuff.
[00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:35.800]   - Well, for example, we know in our own solar system,
[00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:38.720]   we have say Europa, the moon of Jupiter,
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:42.760]   which has got a hundred mile deep ocean
[00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:44.480]   under 10 miles of ice, right?
[00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:45.680]   That's not in the habitable zone.
[00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:47.320]   That is outside the habitable zone.
[00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:48.640]   And that may be the best place.
[00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:52.320]   It's got more water than Earth does, all of its oceans.
[00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:54.800]   It's twice as much water on Europa than there is on Earth.
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:57.200]   So, you know, that may be a really great place
[00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:59.200]   for life to form and it's outside the habitable zone.
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:01.520]   So, you know, the habitable zone is a good place to start
[00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:02.560]   and it helps us.
[00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:05.160]   And there's reasons why you do wanna focus
[00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:06.640]   on the habitable zone because like Europa,
[00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:08.560]   I couldn't, I won't be able to see
[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:12.160]   from across telescopic distances, across light years.
[00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:14.160]   I wouldn't be able to see life on Europa
[00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:16.400]   because it's under 10 miles of ice, right?
[00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:19.640]   So with the important thing about planets
[00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:22.320]   in the habitable zone is that we're thinking
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:24.280]   they have atmospheres.
[00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:26.400]   Atmospheres are the things we can characterize
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:28.640]   for across 10, 50 light years.
[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:31.220]   And we can see biosignatures as we're gonna talk about.
[00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:33.000]   So there is a reason why the habitable zone
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.120]   becomes important for the detection of extra solar life.
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:40.240]   - But for me, when I look up at the stars,
[00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:42.920]   it's very likely that there's a habitable planet
[00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:47.080]   or moon in each of the stars, habitable defined broadly.
[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:50.440]   - Yeah, I think that's not unreasonable to say.
[00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:53.200]   I mean, especially since the formal definition,
[00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:54.520]   you get one in five, right?
[00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:55.360]   One in five is a lot.
[00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:56.560]   There's a lot of stars in the sky.
[00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:58.400]   So yeah, saying that in general,
[00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:00.440]   when I look at a star, there's a pretty good chance
[00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:02.960]   that there's something habitable orbiting it
[00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:06.560]   is not a unreasonable scientific claim.
[00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:10.480]   - To me, it seems like there should be
[00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:13.200]   alien civilizations everywhere.
[00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:16.160]   Why the Fermi Paradox?
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:17.440]   Why haven't we seen them?
[00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:19.440]   - Okay, the Fermi Paradox.
[00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:21.520]   Let's talk about, I love talking about the Fermi Paradox
[00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:24.620]   because there is no Fermi Paradox.
[00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:26.280]   Dun, dun, dun, dun.
[00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:28.120]   Yeah, so the Fermi Paradox, let's talk about
[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:30.600]   the Fermi Paradox and the history of it.
[00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:34.720]   So Enrico Fermi, it's 1950, he's walking with his friends
[00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:38.160]   at Los Alamos Nuclear Weapons Lab to the cantina.
[00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:42.400]   And there had been this cartoon in "The New Yorker."
[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:43.720]   And they all read "The New Yorker."
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:45.680]   And the cartoon was trying to explain
[00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:48.560]   why there had been this rash of garbage cans
[00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:50.320]   being disappearing in New York.
[00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:51.800]   And this cartoon said, "Oh, it's UFOs."
[00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:53.120]   'Cause this is already, it's 1950,
[00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:55.880]   the first big UFO craze happened in '47.
[00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:58.300]   So they were laughing about this as they're walking
[00:42:58.300 --> 00:42:59.560]   and they started being physicists,
[00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:01.100]   started talking about interstellar travel,
[00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:03.400]   interstellar propulsion, blah, blah, blah.
[00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:04.680]   Conversation goes on for a while.
[00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:06.520]   Conversation turns to something else,
[00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:08.520]   they go on to other things.
[00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:12.040]   About 40 minutes later, over lunch, Fermi blurts out,
[00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:13.840]   "Well, where is everybody?"
[00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:15.120]   Typical Fermi sort of thing.
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:16.880]   He'd done the calculation in his head
[00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:18.720]   and he suddenly realized that, look,
[00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:21.960]   if one, if intelligence is common,
[00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:24.840]   that even traveling at sub-light speeds,
[00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:27.640]   a civilization could cross,
[00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:30.180]   kind of hop from one star system to the other
[00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:32.320]   and spread out across the entire galaxy
[00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:34.400]   in a few hundred thousand years.
[00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:35.520]   And he realized this and so he was like,
[00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:36.800]   "Why aren't they here now?"
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:40.080]   And that was the beginning of the Fermi paradox.
[00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:42.000]   It actually got picked up as a formal thing
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.600]   in 1975 in a paper by Hart,
[00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:47.000]   where he actually kind of went through this calculation
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.880]   and showed and said, "Well, there's nobody here now,
[00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:52.440]   "therefore there's nobody anywhere."
[00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:53.720]   Okay, so that is what we will call
[00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:55.100]   the direct Fermi paradox.
[00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:56.600]   Why aren't they here now?
[00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:57.800]   But something happened where people,
[00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:00.000]   after SETI began, where people started to,
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.120]   there was this idea of the great silence.
[00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:03.400]   People got this idea in their head that like,
[00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:06.740]   "Oh, we've been looking for decades now
[00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:08.800]   "for signals of extraterrestrial intelligence
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:10.300]   "and we haven't found any,
[00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:12.060]   "therefore there's nothing out there."
[00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:14.500]   But that, so we'll call that the indirect Fermi paradox.
[00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:17.220]   And there absolutely is no indirect Fermi paradox
[00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:20.460]   for the most mundane of reasons, which is money.
[00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:22.180]   There's never been any money to look.
[00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:25.820]   There really, SETI was always done by researchers
[00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:28.180]   who were kind of like scabbing some time,
[00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:30.000]   some extra time from their other projects
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.460]   to look a little bit at the sky with a telescope.
[00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:34.860]   Telescopes are expensive.
[00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:37.460]   So Jason Wright, one of my collaborators,
[00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:38.740]   he and his students did a study
[00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:42.220]   where they looked at the entire search space for SETI.
[00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:43.220]   And imagine that's an ocean,
[00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:45.340]   all the different stars you have to look at,
[00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:47.100]   the radio frequencies you have to look at,
[00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:49.140]   how when you look, how often you look.
[00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:51.660]   And then they summed up all the SETI searches
[00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:52.500]   that had ever been done.
[00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:53.740]   They went through the literature.
[00:44:53.740 --> 00:44:56.540]   And what they found was if that search space,
[00:44:56.540 --> 00:44:59.620]   if the sky is an ocean and you're looking for fish,
[00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:02.060]   how much of the ocean have we looked at?
[00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:04.120]   And it turns out to be a hot tub.
[00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:06.260]   That's how much of the ocean that we've looked up.
[00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:09.740]   We've dragged a hot tub's worth of ocean water up
[00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:10.940]   and there was no fish in it.
[00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:12.140]   And so now are we gonna say,
[00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:14.220]   oh, well, there's no fish in the ocean, right?
[00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:16.780]   So there is absolutely, positively,
[00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:18.260]   no indirect Fermi paradox.
[00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:21.980]   We just haven't looked, but we're starting to look.
[00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:23.620]   So that's what's, you know, finally we're starting to look.
[00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:25.020]   That's what's exciting.
[00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:26.580]   The direct Fermi paradox,
[00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:28.180]   there are so many ways out of that, right?
[00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:31.760]   There's a book called "77 Solutions to the Fermi Paradox"
[00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:33.940]   that it just, you know, you can pick your favorite one.
[00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:35.920]   It just doesn't carry a lot of weight
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:37.540]   because there's so many ways around it.
[00:45:37.540 --> 00:45:39.700]   We did an actual simulation, my group,
[00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:42.000]   Johnston Carroll, one of my collaborators,
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.620]   we actually simulated the galaxy
[00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:46.540]   and we simulated probes moving at sublight speed
[00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:49.020]   from one star to the other,
[00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:51.660]   gathering resources, heading to the next one.
[00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:54.300]   And so we could actually track the expansion wave
[00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:57.340]   across the galaxy, have one IA biogenesis event,
[00:45:57.340 --> 00:46:00.260]   and then watch the whole galaxy get colonized or settled.
[00:46:00.260 --> 00:46:03.100]   And it is absolutely true that that wave crosses,
[00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:04.900]   you know, Hart was right, Fermi was right.
[00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:06.920]   That wave crosses very quickly.
[00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:09.480]   But civilizations don't last forever, right?
[00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:11.840]   So one question is when did they visit?
[00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:14.200]   When did they come to earth, right?
[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:16.960]   So if you give civilizations a finite lifetime,
[00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:19.420]   you know, let them last 10,000, 100,000 years,
[00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:21.040]   what you find is you now have a steady state.
[00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:22.920]   Civilizations are dying, they're, you know,
[00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:25.680]   they're coming back, they're traveling between the stars.
[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:27.960]   What you find then is you can have big holes opened up.
[00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:30.120]   You can have regions of space where there is nobody
[00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:31.760]   for, you know, millions of years.
[00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:34.480]   And so if that, if we're living in one of those,
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:36.880]   bubbles right now, then maybe we were visited,
[00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:39.440]   but we were visited a hundred million years ago.
[00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:41.280]   And there was a paper that Gavin Schmidt and I did
[00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:42.920]   that showed that if there was a civilization,
[00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:45.720]   whether it was like dinosaurs or aliens
[00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:47.440]   that was here a hundred million years ago,
[00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:48.860]   there's no way to tell.
[00:46:48.860 --> 00:46:50.680]   There's just, there's no record left over.
[00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:52.560]   The fossil record is too sparse.
[00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:54.440]   The only way maybe you could tell is by looking
[00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:58.920]   at the isotopic strata to see if there was anything
[00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:00.880]   reminiscent of an industrial civilization.
[00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:03.800]   But the idea that, you know, you'd be able to find,
[00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:06.560]   you know, iPhones or toppled buildings
[00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:09.600]   after a hundred million years is, there's no way.
[00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:13.140]   - So if there was an alien camp here.
[00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:13.980]   - Yeah.
[00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:16.520]   - An alien village, a small civilization.
[00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:17.360]   - Right.
[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:18.180]   - Maybe even a large civilization.
[00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:19.020]   - Even a large civilization.
[00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:19.860]   Even if it was a large--
[00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:20.680]   - A hundred million years ago.
[00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:21.920]   - And it lasted 10,000 years,
[00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:23.800]   fossil record's not gonna have it.
[00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:25.220]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:47:25.220 --> 00:47:26.840]   The fossil record is too sparse, right?
[00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:28.640]   Most things don't fossilize.
[00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:29.540]   - Yeah.
[00:47:29.540 --> 00:47:31.800]   - And 10,000 years is a blink in the eye
[00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:33.380]   of geological time.
[00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:36.280]   So we call, Gavin called this the Silurian hypothesis
[00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:38.460]   after the Doctor Who episode with the lizard creatures,
[00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:39.640]   the Silurians.
[00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:41.880]   And so that paper got a lot of press.
[00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:45.680]   But it was, you know, it was an important idea.
[00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:46.800]   And this was really Gavin's.
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:48.800]   I was just helping with the astrobiology.
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:50.800]   That to recognize that, like, yeah, you know,
[00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:52.720]   we could have been visited a long time ago.
[00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:54.220]   There just would be no record.
[00:47:54.220 --> 00:47:56.560]   Yeah, it's kind of mind-blowing.
[00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:57.400]   - It's really mind-blowing.
[00:47:57.400 --> 00:47:58.220]   - Yeah.
[00:47:58.220 --> 00:48:00.160]   - And it's also a good reminder that we've been
[00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:03.900]   intelligent species have been here
[00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:05.300]   for a very short amount of time.
[00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:07.220]   - Very short amount of time, yeah.
[00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:08.340]   This is not to say that there was.
[00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:10.240]   Like, so whenever I gave, you know,
[00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:13.440]   like when I was on Joe Rogan for exactly this paper,
[00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:14.500]   and I had to always emphasize,
[00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:18.360]   we're not saying there was a Silurian, you know.
[00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:19.820]   But we're just saying that if there was.
[00:48:19.820 --> 00:48:21.480]   That's why I love Gavin's question.
[00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:23.840]   Gavin's question was just like, how could you tell, right?
[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:26.620]   It was a very beautifully scientific question.
[00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:27.820]   That's what we were really showing,
[00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:29.060]   is that you really, you know,
[00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:31.300]   unless you did a very specific kind of search,
[00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:32.900]   which nobody's done so far,
[00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:35.380]   that, you know, there's not an obvious way to tell
[00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:38.520]   that there could have been civilizations here earlier on.
[00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:42.460]   - I've actually been reading a lot about
[00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:46.580]   ancient civilizations, and it just makes me sad
[00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:49.540]   how much of the wisdom of that time is lost.
[00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:50.380]   - Yeah.
[00:48:50.380 --> 00:48:52.940]   - And how much guessing is going on,
[00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:55.220]   whether it's in South America,
[00:48:55.220 --> 00:48:57.460]   like what happened in the jungle?
[00:48:57.460 --> 00:48:58.620]   - Yeah, like the Amazon.
[00:48:58.620 --> 00:49:00.500]   - Like the Amazon, that was, you know,
[00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:03.220]   the conquistadors came and wiped everybody out,
[00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:06.720]   and especially just even like the plague may have decimated.
[00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:09.460]   So yeah, how much of that civilization?
[00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:10.860]   - And there's a lot of theories,
[00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:15.860]   and you know, because of archeology only looks at cities,
[00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:19.220]   they don't really know the origins of humans,
[00:49:19.220 --> 00:49:21.480]   and there's a lot of really interesting theories,
[00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:22.740]   and they're, of course, controversial.
[00:49:22.740 --> 00:49:25.380]   There's a lot of controversial people in every discipline,
[00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:27.940]   but archeology is like, it's a fascinating one,
[00:49:27.940 --> 00:49:31.000]   'cause we know so little, they're basically storytellers.
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.320]   You're assembling the picture
[00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:36.380]   from just very few puzzle pieces, and it's fascinating.
[00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:39.780]   It makes me, it's humbling, and it's sad
[00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:42.920]   that there could be entire civilizations,
[00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:45.820]   ancient civilizations, that are either
[00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:48.140]   almost entirely or entirely lost.
[00:49:48.140 --> 00:49:51.540]   - Yeah, well, like the indigenous peoples of North America,
[00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:53.740]   there could have been like millions and millions.
[00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:54.780]   You know, we get this idea that like,
[00:49:54.780 --> 00:49:57.980]   oh, you know, the Europeans came, and it was empty,
[00:49:57.980 --> 00:50:00.420]   you know, but it may have only been empty
[00:50:00.420 --> 00:50:02.540]   because the plague had swept up from the,
[00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:05.220]   you know, from the, what happened in Mesoamerica.
[00:50:05.220 --> 00:50:07.140]   So, and yeah, and they didn't really build cities,
[00:50:07.140 --> 00:50:10.340]   but they had, I mean, they didn't build wooden
[00:50:10.340 --> 00:50:13.560]   or stone cities, they built wooden cities, you know?
[00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:15.740]   - Everybody seems to be building pyramids,
[00:50:15.740 --> 00:50:17.060]   and they're really damn good at it.
[00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:18.340]   I don't know what that-- - What is up with a pyramid?
[00:50:18.340 --> 00:50:19.840]   Like, what is, why does that apply?
[00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:22.180]   Like, what archetype in our brain is that?
[00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:25.940]   - It is also really interesting, speaking of archetypes,
[00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:30.620]   is that independent civilizations formed,
[00:50:30.620 --> 00:50:33.840]   and they had a lot of similar kind of dynamics,
[00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:37.900]   like human nature, when it builds up hierarchies
[00:50:37.900 --> 00:50:40.340]   in a certain way, builds up myths and religions
[00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:43.300]   in a certain way, it builds pyramids in a certain way,
[00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:45.620]   it goes to war, all this kind of stuff,
[00:50:45.620 --> 00:50:48.320]   independently emerges, fascinating.
[00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:50.500]   - Santa Fe Institute, the stuff the Santa Fe Institute
[00:50:50.500 --> 00:50:52.620]   does on this, as complex systems, you know,
[00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:55.700]   the origin of hierarchies and such, very cool.
[00:50:55.700 --> 00:50:58.100]   - Yeah, Santa Fe, folks, complexity in general
[00:50:58.100 --> 00:51:00.380]   is really cool. - Really cool.
[00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:02.940]   - What phenomena emerge when a bunch of small things
[00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:04.820]   get together and interact.
[00:51:04.820 --> 00:51:07.940]   Going back to this paper, "A New Empirical Constraint
[00:51:07.940 --> 00:51:10.460]   "on the Prevalence of Technological Species
[00:51:10.460 --> 00:51:13.100]   "in the Universe," this paper that expands
[00:51:13.100 --> 00:51:15.380]   on the Drake equation, what are some interesting things
[00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:16.260]   in this paper?
[00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:17.580]   - Well, so the main thing we were trying to do
[00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:19.740]   with this paper is say, look, we have all of this
[00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:23.100]   exoplanet data, right, it's gotta be good for something,
[00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:25.900]   especially since two of the terms that have been nailed down
[00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:29.300]   empirically are two terms in the Drake equation.
[00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:32.300]   So F sub P, that's the second term, fraction of stars
[00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:35.380]   that have planets, and then N sub E, the average number
[00:51:35.380 --> 00:51:36.860]   of planets in the habitable zone.
[00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:39.740]   Those are the second and third term in the Drake equation.
[00:51:39.740 --> 00:51:41.660]   So what that means is all the astronomical terms
[00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:42.500]   have been nailed.
[00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:44.780]   And so we said like, okay, how do we use this
[00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:46.700]   to do something with the Drake equation?
[00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:48.980]   And so we realized is, well, okay, we gotta get rid
[00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:51.060]   of time, the lifetime thing, we can't say anything
[00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:52.620]   about that.
[00:51:52.620 --> 00:51:56.180]   But if we let that, if we don't ask how long they last,
[00:51:56.180 --> 00:51:59.100]   but instead ask, what's the probability
[00:51:59.100 --> 00:52:01.740]   that there have been any civilizations at all,
[00:52:01.740 --> 00:52:03.020]   no matter how long they lasted?
[00:52:03.020 --> 00:52:04.940]   I'm not asking whether they exist now or not,
[00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:08.820]   I'm just asking in general about probabilities
[00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:12.260]   to make a technological civilization anywhere
[00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:14.220]   and at any time in the history of the universe.
[00:52:14.220 --> 00:52:16.340]   And that we were able to constrain.
[00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:21.340]   And so what we found was basically that there have been
[00:52:21.340 --> 00:52:26.820]   10 billion trillion habitable zone planets in the universe.
[00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:32.220]   And what that means is those are 10 billion trillion
[00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:34.220]   experiments that have been run.
[00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:38.620]   And the only way that we're the only time that this is,
[00:52:38.620 --> 00:52:43.420]   this whole process from a biogenesis to a civilization
[00:52:43.420 --> 00:52:46.180]   has occurred is if every one of those experiments failed.
[00:52:46.180 --> 00:52:48.700]   So therefore you could put a probability,
[00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:50.780]   we called it the pessimism line, right?
[00:52:50.780 --> 00:52:54.380]   We don't really know what nature sets for the probability
[00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:56.300]   of making intelligent civilizations, right?
[00:52:56.300 --> 00:52:58.060]   But we could set a limit using this.
[00:52:58.060 --> 00:53:00.820]   We could say, look, as if the probability
[00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:04.940]   per habitable zone planet is less than 10 to the minus 22,
[00:53:04.940 --> 00:53:07.500]   one in 10 billion trillion, then yeah, we're alone.
[00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:09.340]   If it's anywhere larger than that,
[00:53:09.340 --> 00:53:11.740]   then we're not the first, it's happened somewhere else.
[00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:14.140]   And to me, that was mind blowing.
[00:53:14.140 --> 00:53:15.780]   Doesn't tell me there's anybody nearby,
[00:53:15.780 --> 00:53:17.220]   the galaxy could be sterile.
[00:53:17.220 --> 00:53:19.520]   It just told me that like, you know,
[00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:22.540]   unless nature's really against,
[00:53:22.540 --> 00:53:24.980]   it has some bias against civilizations,
[00:53:24.980 --> 00:53:26.340]   we're not the first time this has happened.
[00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:28.460]   This has happened elsewhere over the course
[00:53:28.460 --> 00:53:29.940]   of cosmic history.
[00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:33.420]   - 10 billion trillion experiments.
[00:53:33.420 --> 00:53:35.380]   - Yeah, that's a lot of experiments.
[00:53:35.380 --> 00:53:36.220]   - That's a lot.
[00:53:36.220 --> 00:53:37.060]   - Right.
[00:53:37.060 --> 00:53:38.060]   - A thousand is a lot.
[00:53:38.060 --> 00:53:38.880]   - Yeah.
[00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:39.720]   - A hundred is a lot.
[00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:40.980]   - Yeah.
[00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:43.540]   - If we normal humans saw a hundred experiments
[00:53:43.540 --> 00:53:48.540]   and we knew that at least one time
[00:53:48.540 --> 00:53:51.460]   there was a successful human civilization built,
[00:53:51.460 --> 00:53:53.300]   I mean, we would say for sure,
[00:53:53.300 --> 00:53:54.740]   in a hundred, you'll get another one.
[00:53:54.740 --> 00:53:56.300]   - Yeah, yeah, so that's what I mean, that's why,
[00:53:56.300 --> 00:53:57.940]   so this, you know, these kinds of arguments,
[00:53:57.940 --> 00:53:59.220]   you have to be careful of what they can do,
[00:53:59.220 --> 00:54:01.500]   but what it really, I felt like what this paper showed
[00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:03.140]   was that, you know, the burden of proof
[00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:05.100]   is now on the pessimists, right?
[00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:07.100]   So that's why we called it the pessimism line.
[00:54:07.100 --> 00:54:08.620]   There's been, you know, throughout history,
[00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:11.540]   there's been, you know, alien pessimists
[00:54:11.540 --> 00:54:13.620]   and alien optimists, and they've been yelling at each other.
[00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:14.820]   That's all they had to go with, right?
[00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:17.300]   You know, and like with Giordano Bruno in 1600,
[00:54:17.300 --> 00:54:19.060]   they burned the guy at the stake
[00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:20.580]   for being an alien optimist.
[00:54:20.580 --> 00:54:23.220]   But nobody really knew what pessimism or optimism meant.
[00:54:23.220 --> 00:54:24.420]   This, you know, we sort of thought
[00:54:24.420 --> 00:54:25.660]   this was like the Planck length.
[00:54:25.660 --> 00:54:27.620]   This was sort of the Planck length of astrobiology.
[00:54:27.620 --> 00:54:30.020]   Gave you an actual number that, you know,
[00:54:30.020 --> 00:54:33.180]   if you could somehow calculate what the probability,
[00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:36.020]   you know, of forming a technological civilization was,
[00:54:36.020 --> 00:54:38.620]   this thing sort of shows you where the limit is.
[00:54:38.620 --> 00:54:40.660]   As long as you're above 10 to the minus 22,
[00:54:40.660 --> 00:54:43.380]   then you actually, absolutely, it has occurred
[00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:44.900]   in the history.
[00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:46.300]   Other civilizations have occurred
[00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:47.140]   in the history of the universe.
[00:54:47.140 --> 00:54:49.620]   - So to me, at least, the big question is Fe,
[00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:52.300]   which is basically abiogenesis.
[00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:55.020]   How hard is it for life to originate on a planet?
[00:54:55.020 --> 00:54:58.340]   'Cause all the other ones seem very likely.
[00:54:58.340 --> 00:54:59.620]   Everything seems very likely.
[00:54:59.620 --> 00:55:01.540]   The only open question to me is like,
[00:55:01.540 --> 00:55:03.260]   how hard is it for life to originate?
[00:55:03.260 --> 00:55:05.100]   - There's lots of ways to, again, you know,
[00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:06.620]   we don't know unless we look.
[00:55:06.620 --> 00:55:09.580]   And, you know, you had Sarah Walker on not too long ago.
[00:55:09.580 --> 00:55:12.140]   You know, she's very interested in origins of life.
[00:55:12.140 --> 00:55:15.380]   So, you know, lots of people are working on this,
[00:55:15.380 --> 00:55:18.940]   but I think it's hard looking at the history of the earth.
[00:55:18.940 --> 00:55:19.780]   You know, and again, this is,
[00:55:19.780 --> 00:55:22.140]   you can do Bayesian arguments on this.
[00:55:22.140 --> 00:55:25.340]   But yeah, forming life, I don't think it's hard.
[00:55:25.340 --> 00:55:28.780]   Getting like basic biology started, I don't think is hard.
[00:55:28.780 --> 00:55:29.820]   It's still wild.
[00:55:29.820 --> 00:55:31.540]   It's an amazing process that actually, I think,
[00:55:31.540 --> 00:55:35.740]   requires some deep rethinking about how we conceptualize
[00:55:35.740 --> 00:55:37.620]   what life is and what life isn't.
[00:55:37.620 --> 00:55:40.220]   That's one of the things I like about Sarah's work.
[00:55:40.220 --> 00:55:43.500]   We're pursuing on a different level about life
[00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:48.420]   as the only system that uses information.
[00:55:48.420 --> 00:55:51.740]   But still, regardless of all those kinds of details,
[00:55:51.740 --> 00:55:53.300]   life is probably easy to make.
[00:55:53.300 --> 00:55:55.060]   That's my gut feeling, you know.
[00:55:55.060 --> 00:55:58.260]   - Yeah, I mean, day by day this changes for me.
[00:55:58.260 --> 00:56:01.700]   But as you see, once you create bacteria,
[00:56:01.700 --> 00:56:03.500]   it's off to the races.
[00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:05.300]   You're gonna get complex life.
[00:56:05.300 --> 00:56:07.220]   As long as you have enough time,
[00:56:07.220 --> 00:56:09.260]   I mean, that boring billion,
[00:56:09.260 --> 00:56:12.980]   but I just can't imagine a habitable planet
[00:56:12.980 --> 00:56:15.900]   not having a couple billion to spare.
[00:56:15.900 --> 00:56:17.820]   - Yeah, a couple billion years to spare.
[00:56:17.820 --> 00:56:19.340]   You know, there is a mystery there
[00:56:19.340 --> 00:56:21.300]   about why did it take so long?
[00:56:21.300 --> 00:56:22.700]   Like with the Cambrian explosion?
[00:56:22.700 --> 00:56:24.620]   But that may be, again, about these windows.
[00:56:24.620 --> 00:56:27.740]   That like, it couldn't happen until the window,
[00:56:27.740 --> 00:56:30.700]   the planet and the life had evolved together enough
[00:56:30.700 --> 00:56:32.580]   that they together kind of opened the window
[00:56:32.580 --> 00:56:34.740]   for the next step.
[00:56:34.740 --> 00:56:38.820]   You know, intelligent life and how long intelligent,
[00:56:38.820 --> 00:56:40.300]   technological civilizations,
[00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:42.540]   I think there's a big question about how long those last
[00:56:42.540 --> 00:56:44.740]   and how, you know, I'm hopeful, you know.
[00:56:44.740 --> 00:56:48.100]   But in terms of just like,
[00:56:48.100 --> 00:56:50.580]   I think life is absolutely gonna be common
[00:56:50.580 --> 00:56:52.140]   in the, you know, pretty common in the universe.
[00:56:52.140 --> 00:56:53.700]   - Yeah, I think it's absolutely like,
[00:56:53.700 --> 00:56:56.260]   I think, again, if I were to bet everything,
[00:56:56.260 --> 00:57:00.360]   even in advanced civilizations are common.
[00:57:01.260 --> 00:57:06.220]   So the, to me then, the only explanation is the L.
[00:57:06.220 --> 00:57:09.420]   Our galaxy is a graveyard of civilizations.
[00:57:09.420 --> 00:57:10.620]   - Yeah, 'cause, you know, you think about it,
[00:57:10.620 --> 00:57:12.540]   we've only been around, I mean, as a tech lot,
[00:57:12.540 --> 00:57:15.500]   truly, you know, when we think about in Drake's definition,
[00:57:15.500 --> 00:57:16.660]   you had to have radio telescopes.
[00:57:16.660 --> 00:57:18.140]   That's been 100 years, you know.
[00:57:18.140 --> 00:57:21.900]   And if we got another 10,000, 100,000 years of history,
[00:57:21.900 --> 00:57:24.980]   that would be, for us, that'd be pretty amazing, right?
[00:57:24.980 --> 00:57:26.380]   But that's still, that wouldn't be long enough
[00:57:26.380 --> 00:57:28.980]   to really pop up the number of civilizations
[00:57:28.980 --> 00:57:30.500]   in the galaxy.
[00:57:30.500 --> 00:57:32.140]   So you really need it to be, like,
[00:57:32.140 --> 00:57:33.900]   hundreds of millions of years.
[00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:37.380]   And that raises a question which I am very interested in,
[00:57:37.380 --> 00:57:39.420]   which is, how do you even talk about,
[00:57:39.420 --> 00:57:41.360]   I call it the billionaire civilization, right?
[00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:44.140]   How do we even begin to hypothesize or think about,
[00:57:44.140 --> 00:57:46.180]   in any kind of systematic way,
[00:57:46.180 --> 00:57:48.780]   what happens to a technological civilization
[00:57:48.780 --> 00:57:52.700]   across hundreds of millions to a billion years?
[00:57:52.700 --> 00:57:55.420]   - Yeah, like, how do you even simulate the trajectories
[00:57:55.420 --> 00:57:58.260]   that civilizations can take across that kind of timescale?
[00:57:58.260 --> 00:57:59.100]   - Yeah.
[00:57:59.100 --> 00:58:02.900]   All the data we have is just for the 10,000 years or so,
[00:58:02.900 --> 00:58:07.240]   20,000 years that humans have been building civilizations.
[00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:09.260]   And then just, I don't know what you put it at,
[00:58:09.260 --> 00:58:12.140]   but maybe 100 years that we've been technological.
[00:58:12.140 --> 00:58:14.280]   - Yeah, and we're ready to blow ourselves to bits
[00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:16.220]   or drive ourselves off the planet.
[00:58:16.220 --> 00:58:17.360]   Yeah, no, it's really interesting.
[00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:18.200]   But there's gotta be a way.
[00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:19.540]   I think that's really a frontier.
[00:58:19.540 --> 00:58:22.420]   So you had David Kipping on not too long ago.
[00:58:22.420 --> 00:58:24.860]   And David and I did a paper, and Caleb Scharf,
[00:58:24.860 --> 00:58:27.100]   David really drove this, where we,
[00:58:27.100 --> 00:58:29.540]   it was a Bayesian calculation to sort of ask the question,
[00:58:29.540 --> 00:58:31.980]   if you were to find a detection,
[00:58:31.980 --> 00:58:35.140]   if you were to find a signal or a techno signature,
[00:58:35.140 --> 00:58:38.220]   would that come from a civilization that was younger,
[00:58:38.220 --> 00:58:40.020]   your age or older?
[00:58:40.020 --> 00:58:41.780]   And you could see, I mean, this is not hard to do,
[00:58:41.780 --> 00:58:44.420]   but it was great, the formalism, the formalism was hard.
[00:58:44.420 --> 00:58:46.940]   It's kind of intuitive, but the formalism was hard
[00:58:46.940 --> 00:58:49.480]   to show that, yeah, they're older, probably much older.
[00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:51.300]   So that means you really do need to think about like,
[00:58:51.300 --> 00:58:54.180]   okay, how do billion year civilizations
[00:58:54.180 --> 00:58:55.460]   manifest themselves?
[00:58:55.460 --> 00:58:57.300]   What signatures will they leave?
[00:58:57.300 --> 00:59:00.060]   And yeah, can you even, I mean, what's so cool about it,
[00:59:00.060 --> 00:59:01.940]   it's so much fun, because you gotta,
[00:59:01.940 --> 00:59:04.900]   like you have to imagine the unimaginable.
[00:59:04.900 --> 00:59:08.060]   Would you still, I mean, obviously biological evolution
[00:59:08.060 --> 00:59:10.620]   can happen on those kinds of timescales.
[00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:12.100]   So you wouldn't even really be the same thing
[00:59:12.100 --> 00:59:14.300]   you started out as, but social forms,
[00:59:14.300 --> 00:59:16.620]   what kind of social forms can you imagine
[00:59:16.620 --> 00:59:18.800]   that would be continuous over that?
[00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:19.940]   Or maybe they wouldn't be continuous,
[00:59:19.940 --> 00:59:22.140]   you'd get, they'd drop out, they'd destroy themselves,
[00:59:22.140 --> 00:59:23.020]   and then they'd come back.
[00:59:23.020 --> 00:59:27.620]   So maybe it's a trunk, or a punctuated evolution.
[00:59:27.620 --> 00:59:29.660]   I mean, but we gotta sort of, this is the fun part,
[00:59:29.660 --> 00:59:31.580]   we have to sort of work this out.
[00:59:31.580 --> 00:59:34.700]   - Well, I mean, one way to push that question is like,
[00:59:34.700 --> 00:59:38.380]   how, what are the different ways to achieve homeostasis
[00:59:38.380 --> 00:59:41.500]   as you get greater and greater technological innovation?
[00:59:41.500 --> 00:59:44.820]   So like, if you expand out into the universe,
[00:59:44.820 --> 00:59:48.020]   and you have, up to Kardashev scale,
[00:59:48.020 --> 00:59:51.100]   what are the ways you can avoid destroying yourself?
[00:59:51.100 --> 00:59:54.460]   Just achieve stability while still growing?
[00:59:54.460 --> 00:59:55.300]   - Yeah. - And,
[00:59:55.300 --> 00:59:58.500]   I mean, that's an interesting question.
[00:59:58.500 --> 01:00:00.640]   I think it's probably simulatable.
[01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:02.520]   - Could be, I mean, agent-based modeling,
[01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:03.360]   you could do it with that.
[01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:06.140]   So our group has used agent-based modeling
[01:00:06.140 --> 01:00:07.860]   to do something like the Fermi paradox,
[01:00:07.860 --> 01:00:09.620]   that was agent-based modeling.
[01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:11.940]   But you can also do this, people at Santa Fe have done this,
[01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:14.500]   other groups have done this, to use agent-based modeling
[01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:17.960]   to track the formation of hierarchies,
[01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:20.700]   the formation of stable hierarchies.
[01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:23.460]   So I think that, I think it's actually very doable,
[01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:26.780]   but understanding the kind of assumptions and principles
[01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:27.600]   that are going into it,
[01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:29.020]   and what you can extract from those,
[01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:31.160]   that is what is sort of the frontier.
[01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:34.720]   - Do you think if humans colonized Mars,
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:40.540]   the dynamic between the civilization on Earth and Mars
[01:00:40.540 --> 01:00:43.700]   will be fundamentally different than the dynamic
[01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:46.420]   between individual nations on Earth right now?
[01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:48.420]   Like, that's a thing to load into the simulation,
[01:00:48.420 --> 01:00:50.340]   the agent-based simulation we're talking about.
[01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:51.440]   If we settle it,
[01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:53.500]   Mars will very quickly wanna become its own nation.
[01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:57.860]   - Well, no, there's already gonna be nations on Mars,
[01:00:57.860 --> 01:00:58.700]   that's guaranteed.
[01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:01.100]   The moment you have two million people,
[01:01:01.100 --> 01:01:02.500]   the moment you have one million people,
[01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:04.580]   there's gonna be two tribes.
[01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:06.740]   And then they're going to start fighting.
[01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:09.420]   And the question is, interplanetary fighting,
[01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:10.860]   how quickly does that happen,
[01:01:10.860 --> 01:01:13.380]   and does it have a different nature to it?
[01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:14.900]   Because of the distances, you know?
[01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:16.940]   - Are you a fan of "The Expanse"?
[01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:18.300]   Do any of you watch "The Expanse"?
[01:01:18.420 --> 01:01:19.980]   - Great show, 'cause it's all about the,
[01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:21.500]   I highly recommend to everybody,
[01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:23.260]   it's based on a series of books that are excellent.
[01:01:23.260 --> 01:01:24.860]   It's on Prime, six seasons,
[01:01:24.860 --> 01:01:26.900]   and it's basically about the settled solar system.
[01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:28.500]   It takes place about 300 years from now,
[01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:30.140]   and the entire solar system is settled.
[01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:33.740]   And it is the best show about interplanetary politics.
[01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:36.780]   The first season, actually, the journal, what was it?
[01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:40.900]   Foreign Affairs said the best show on TV about politics
[01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:43.820]   it takes place is interplanetary.
[01:01:43.820 --> 01:01:46.060]   So yeah, I think, you know, human beings being human beings,
[01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:49.100]   yes, there will be warfare and there will be conflict.
[01:01:49.100 --> 01:01:50.940]   I mean, I don't think it'll be necessarily
[01:01:50.940 --> 01:01:52.300]   all that different, you know?
[01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:54.480]   Because really, I think within a few hundred years,
[01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:57.580]   we will have lots of people in the solar system.
[01:01:57.580 --> 01:01:58.660]   And it doesn't even have to be on Mars.
[01:01:58.660 --> 01:02:00.980]   We did a paper where we looked,
[01:02:00.980 --> 01:02:03.060]   based on, 'cause I wanted to know about
[01:02:03.060 --> 01:02:05.620]   whether an idea in "The Expanse" was really possible.
[01:02:05.620 --> 01:02:07.860]   In "The Expanse," the asteroid belt,
[01:02:07.860 --> 01:02:09.460]   what they've done is they have colonized
[01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:11.460]   the asteroid belt by hollowing out the asteroids
[01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:14.100]   and spinning them up and living on the inside, right?
[01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:15.620]   'Cause they have the Coriolis force.
[01:02:15.620 --> 01:02:17.300]   And I felt like, wow, what a cool idea.
[01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:19.220]   And when I ran the blog for NPR,
[01:02:19.220 --> 01:02:20.780]   I actually talked to the guys and said,
[01:02:20.780 --> 01:02:23.740]   "Did you guys calculate this to see whether it's possible?"
[01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:25.100]   Sadly, it's not possible.
[01:02:25.100 --> 01:02:27.360]   The rock is just not strong enough
[01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:29.460]   that if you tried to spin it up to the speeds
[01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:32.100]   you need to get 1/3 gravity,
[01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:34.820]   which is what I think the minimum you need for human beings,
[01:02:34.820 --> 01:02:36.300]   the rock would just fall apart, it would break.
[01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:38.020]   But we came up with another idea,
[01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:39.940]   which was that if you could take small asteroids,
[01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:42.740]   put a giant bag around them, a nanofiber bag,
[01:02:42.740 --> 01:02:45.300]   and spin those up, it would inflate the bag.
[01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:48.900]   And then even a small couple kilometer wide asteroid
[01:02:48.900 --> 01:02:50.460]   would expand out to,
[01:02:50.460 --> 01:02:54.780]   you could get like Manhattan's worth of material inside.
[01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:56.780]   So forget about even colonizing Mars,
[01:02:56.780 --> 01:02:59.260]   space stations, right, or space habitats
[01:02:59.260 --> 01:03:01.340]   with millions of people in them.
[01:03:01.340 --> 01:03:03.820]   So anyway, the point is that I think,
[01:03:03.820 --> 01:03:06.940]   within a few hundred years, it is not unimaginable
[01:03:06.940 --> 01:03:10.060]   that there will be millions, if not billions of people
[01:03:10.060 --> 01:03:11.580]   living in the solar system.
[01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:13.860]   - And so you think most of them will be in space habitats
[01:03:13.860 --> 01:03:16.420]   versus on Mars on the planetary surface?
[01:03:16.420 --> 01:03:18.380]   - It's a lot easier on some level, right?
[01:03:18.380 --> 01:03:21.140]   It depends on how, like with nanofabrication and such.
[01:03:21.140 --> 01:03:24.300]   But getting down to gravity well is hard, right?
[01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:26.900]   So there's a certain way in which there's a lot of,
[01:03:26.900 --> 01:03:30.300]   it's a lot easier to build real estate out of asteroids.
[01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:31.180]   But we'll probably do both.
[01:03:31.180 --> 01:03:33.500]   I mean, I think what'll happen is, the next,
[01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:35.380]   should we make it through climate change and nuclear war
[01:03:35.380 --> 01:03:37.340]   and all the other, and AI,
[01:03:37.340 --> 01:03:40.460]   the next thousand years of human history
[01:03:40.460 --> 01:03:42.060]   is the solar system, right?
[01:03:42.060 --> 01:03:45.660]   And so I think we'll settle every nook and cranny
[01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:47.020]   we possibly can.
[01:03:47.020 --> 01:03:49.460]   And it's a beautiful, what I love about,
[01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:50.900]   what's hopeful about it, is this idea
[01:03:50.900 --> 01:03:53.300]   you're gonna have all of these pockets.
[01:03:53.300 --> 01:03:55.980]   And I'm sure there's gonna be a Mormon space habitat,
[01:03:55.980 --> 01:03:57.940]   like there's gonna be, whatever you want,
[01:03:57.940 --> 01:03:59.780]   a libertarian space habitat.
[01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:01.660]   Everybody's gonna be able to kind of create their,
[01:04:01.660 --> 01:04:04.180]   there'll be lots of experiments in human flourishing.
[01:04:04.180 --> 01:04:06.580]   And those kinds of experiments will be really useful
[01:04:06.580 --> 01:04:08.780]   for us to sort of figure out better ways
[01:04:08.780 --> 01:04:11.580]   for us to interact and have maximum flourishing,
[01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:15.260]   maximum wellness, maximum democracy, maximum freedom.
[01:04:15.260 --> 01:04:17.580]   - Do you think that's a good backup solution
[01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:22.100]   to go out into space, sort of to avoid the possibility
[01:04:22.100 --> 01:04:24.540]   of humans destroying themselves completely here on Earth?
[01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:26.580]   - Well, I think, I wanna be always careful with that
[01:04:26.580 --> 01:04:28.500]   because like I said, it's centuries
[01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:30.140]   that we're talking about, right?
[01:04:30.140 --> 01:04:32.540]   So the problem with climate change,
[01:04:32.540 --> 01:04:33.500]   and same thing with nuclear war,
[01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:35.020]   it's breathing down our necks now.
[01:04:35.020 --> 01:04:40.020]   So it's not a, trying to establish a base on Mars,
[01:04:40.060 --> 01:04:43.100]   it's gonna be so hard that it is not even gonna be close
[01:04:43.100 --> 01:04:46.500]   to being self-sufficient for a couple of,
[01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:47.740]   a century at least.
[01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:50.460]   So it's not like a backup plan now.
[01:04:50.460 --> 01:04:52.540]   We have to solve the problem of climate change.
[01:04:52.540 --> 01:04:53.460]   We have to deal with that.
[01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:55.980]   There's still enough nuclear weapons to really do
[01:04:55.980 --> 01:04:59.100]   horrific things to the planet for human beings.
[01:04:59.100 --> 01:05:01.220]   So I don't think it's like a backup plan in that way,
[01:05:01.220 --> 01:05:03.700]   but I do think, like I said, it's the prize.
[01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:07.860]   If we get through this, then we get the entire solar system
[01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:10.140]   to sort of play around in and experiment with
[01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:11.540]   and do really cool things with.
[01:05:11.540 --> 01:05:12.780]   - Well, I think it could be a lot less
[01:05:12.780 --> 01:05:17.100]   than a couple of centuries if there's a urgency,
[01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:19.820]   like a real urgency, like a catastrophe,
[01:05:19.820 --> 01:05:23.780]   like maybe a small nuclear war breaks out
[01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:26.820]   where it's like, holy shit, this is for sure,
[01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:29.260]   for sure a bigger one is looming.
[01:05:29.260 --> 01:05:32.220]   Maybe if geopolitically the war between China
[01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:34.020]   and the United States escalates,
[01:05:34.020 --> 01:05:35.860]   where there's this tension that builds and builds
[01:05:35.860 --> 01:05:37.700]   and builds, and it becomes more obvious
[01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:40.260]   that we need to really, really, really accelerate.
[01:05:40.260 --> 01:05:43.180]   - I think my only dilemma with that is that
[01:05:43.180 --> 01:05:47.180]   I just think that a self-sufficient base is so far away
[01:05:47.180 --> 01:05:49.140]   that like, say, you start doing that,
[01:05:49.140 --> 01:05:51.260]   and then there is a full-scale nuclear exchange.
[01:05:51.260 --> 01:05:53.220]   That base is, you know, it's not gonna last
[01:05:53.220 --> 01:05:55.300]   'cause it's just, you know, the self-sufficiency
[01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:57.540]   requires a kind of an economy,
[01:05:57.540 --> 01:06:00.100]   like literally a material economy
[01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:02.340]   that we are so far from with Mars,
[01:06:02.340 --> 01:06:03.780]   that we are centuries from.
[01:06:03.780 --> 01:06:05.660]   Like I said, you know, three centuries,
[01:06:05.660 --> 01:06:07.380]   which is not that long, two to three centuries.
[01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:10.340]   You know, look at 1820, nobody had traveled faster
[01:06:10.340 --> 01:06:11.580]   than 60 miles an hour,
[01:06:11.580 --> 01:06:13.580]   unless they were falling off a cliff, right?
[01:06:13.580 --> 01:06:15.900]   And now we routinely travel at 500 miles an hour,
[01:06:15.900 --> 01:06:17.940]   but it is sort of centuries long.
[01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:20.300]   So that's why I think we'd be better off
[01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:23.860]   trying to solve these problems than, you know,
[01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:25.860]   I just think the odds that we're gonna be able
[01:06:25.860 --> 01:06:29.340]   to create a self-sufficient colony on Mars
[01:06:29.340 --> 01:06:33.820]   before that threat comes to head is small.
[01:06:33.820 --> 01:06:35.260]   So we'd have to deal with the threat.
[01:06:35.260 --> 01:06:37.980]   - That's an interesting scientific and engineering question
[01:06:37.980 --> 01:06:40.860]   of how to create a self-sufficient colony on Mars
[01:06:40.860 --> 01:06:43.060]   or out in space as a space habitat.
[01:06:43.060 --> 01:06:46.060]   Like where Earth entirely could be destroyed,
[01:06:46.060 --> 01:06:46.940]   you could still survive.
[01:06:46.940 --> 01:06:48.420]   - Yeah, yeah, 'cause it's really what about,
[01:06:48.420 --> 01:06:51.340]   you know, thinking about complex systems, right?
[01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:55.780]   A space habitat, you know, would have to be as robust
[01:06:55.780 --> 01:06:58.020]   as an ecosystem, as the kind of thing, you know,
[01:06:58.020 --> 01:06:59.060]   you go out and you see a pond
[01:06:59.060 --> 01:07:01.740]   with all the different webs of interactions.
[01:07:01.740 --> 01:07:04.060]   You know, that's why I always think that, you know,
[01:07:04.060 --> 01:07:07.660]   if this process of going out into space
[01:07:07.660 --> 01:07:10.620]   is actually, will help us with climate change
[01:07:10.620 --> 01:07:12.300]   and with thinking about making a long-term,
[01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:14.660]   sustainable version of human civilization,
[01:07:14.660 --> 01:07:17.300]   'cause you really have to think about these webs,
[01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:18.900]   the complexity of these webs,
[01:07:18.900 --> 01:07:21.380]   and recognize the biosphere has been doing this forever.
[01:07:21.380 --> 01:07:23.340]   The biosphere knows how to do this, right?
[01:07:23.340 --> 01:07:24.580]   And so A, how do we support,
[01:07:24.580 --> 01:07:27.820]   how do we build a vibrant, powerful technosphere
[01:07:27.820 --> 01:07:31.340]   that also doesn't, you know, mess with the biosphere,
[01:07:31.340 --> 01:07:33.300]   mess with the biosphere's capacity
[01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:34.940]   to support our technosphere?
[01:07:34.940 --> 01:07:36.020]   So, you know, by doing this,
[01:07:36.020 --> 01:07:37.420]   by trying to build space habitats,
[01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:38.820]   in some sense, you're thinking about
[01:07:38.820 --> 01:07:40.860]   building a small-scale version of this.
[01:07:40.860 --> 01:07:42.440]   So I think the two problems
[01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:44.420]   are gonna kind of feed back on each other.
[01:07:44.420 --> 01:07:47.340]   - Well, there's also the other possibility of,
[01:07:47.340 --> 01:07:51.340]   like the movie, Darren Aronofsky's "Postcard from Earth,"
[01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:53.860]   where we can create this kind of life gun
[01:07:53.860 --> 01:07:58.860]   that just shoots, as opposed to engineering everything,
[01:07:58.860 --> 01:08:02.100]   basically seeding life on a bunch of places
[01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:03.800]   and letting life do its thing,
[01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:06.700]   which is really good at doing, it seems like.
[01:08:06.700 --> 01:08:08.900]   So as opposed to, like, with a space habitat,
[01:08:08.900 --> 01:08:11.220]   you basically have to build the entire
[01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:13.580]   biosphere and technosphere, the whole thing,
[01:08:13.580 --> 01:08:15.500]   by yourself. - The whole thing, yeah.
[01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:17.540]   - You know, if you just, hey,
[01:08:17.540 --> 01:08:20.340]   the aforementioned cockroach with some bacteria,
[01:08:20.340 --> 01:08:22.900]   place it in Europa,
[01:08:22.900 --> 01:08:24.860]   I think you'd be surprised what happens.
[01:08:24.860 --> 01:08:25.700]   - Yeah, yeah. - Right?
[01:08:25.700 --> 01:08:29.180]   Like, honestly, if you put a huge amount of bacteria,
[01:08:29.180 --> 01:08:33.260]   like, a giant number of organisms from Earth
[01:08:33.260 --> 01:08:39.140]   on Mars, on some of these moons
[01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:41.380]   of the other planets in the solar system,
[01:08:41.380 --> 01:08:43.140]   do you think, like, I feel like some of them
[01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:45.300]   would actually find a way to survive.
[01:08:45.300 --> 01:08:46.340]   - I, you know, the moon is hard,
[01:08:46.340 --> 01:08:47.940]   'cause the moon is just like, there's no, you know,
[01:08:47.940 --> 01:08:49.700]   the moon may be really hard.
[01:08:49.700 --> 01:08:50.580]   But, you know, that'd be, I mean,
[01:08:50.580 --> 01:08:52.420]   I wonder if somebody must've done these experiments, right?
[01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:54.540]   Like, how, 'cause we know they're extremophiles, right?
[01:08:54.540 --> 01:08:56.900]   We know that they're, you can go down, you know,
[01:08:56.900 --> 01:08:58.780]   10 miles below the Earth's surface,
[01:08:58.780 --> 01:09:01.100]   and there are things where there's no sunlight,
[01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:03.660]   there's, you know, the conditions are so extreme,
[01:09:03.660 --> 01:09:06.740]   and there's lots of microbes having a great time,
[01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:09.540]   living off the radioactivity, you know, in the rocks.
[01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:11.700]   But, you know, they had lots of time
[01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:13.220]   to evolve to those conditions.
[01:09:13.220 --> 01:09:16.780]   So I'm not sure if you dumped a bunch of bacteria,
[01:09:16.780 --> 01:09:17.700]   you know, so somebody, like,
[01:09:17.700 --> 01:09:19.020]   somebody must've done these experiments.
[01:09:19.020 --> 01:09:24.020]   Like, you know, how fast could microbial evolution occur
[01:09:24.020 --> 01:09:28.660]   in under harsh conditions that you maybe get somebody
[01:09:28.660 --> 01:09:30.940]   who figures out, okay, I can deal with this.
[01:09:30.940 --> 01:09:32.940]   I think the moon's too much, 'cause it's so sterile.
[01:09:32.940 --> 01:09:35.380]   But, you know, Mars, I don't know, maybe.
[01:09:35.380 --> 01:09:36.220]   I don't know.
[01:09:36.220 --> 01:09:37.700]   We'd have to, but it's an interesting idea.
[01:09:37.700 --> 01:09:39.660]   - I wonder if somebody has done those experiments.
[01:09:39.660 --> 01:09:40.900]   - Yeah, I mean, you'd think somebody would.
[01:09:40.900 --> 01:09:42.420]   Like, let's take a bunch of microbes.
[01:09:42.420 --> 01:09:44.860]   - The harsh, take the harshest possible condition
[01:09:44.860 --> 01:09:46.140]   of all different kinds, temperature,
[01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:46.980]   all this kind of stuff. - Right, right.
[01:09:46.980 --> 01:09:49.220]   Pressure, salinity, and then just, like,
[01:09:49.220 --> 01:09:51.780]   dump a bunch of things that are not used to it,
[01:09:51.780 --> 01:09:53.980]   and then just see, does everybody just die?
[01:09:53.980 --> 01:09:55.100]   You know, that's it, there's, you know.
[01:09:55.100 --> 01:09:58.220]   The thing about life, it flourishes
[01:09:58.220 --> 01:09:59.940]   in a non-sterile environment where there's a bunch
[01:09:59.940 --> 01:10:02.580]   of options for resources, even if the condition
[01:10:02.580 --> 01:10:03.700]   is super harsh.
[01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:06.640]   In the lab, I don't know if you can reconstruct
[01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:09.940]   harsh conditions plus options for survival.
[01:10:09.940 --> 01:10:11.420]   You know what I mean? - Yeah, yeah.
[01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:16.300]   - Like, you have to have the huge variety of resources
[01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:19.300]   that are always available on a planet somehow,
[01:10:19.300 --> 01:10:20.820]   even when it's a super harsh condition.
[01:10:20.820 --> 01:10:24.100]   So that's actually not a trivial experiment.
[01:10:24.100 --> 01:10:26.220]   And I wouldn't even, if somebody did that experiment
[01:10:26.220 --> 01:10:28.540]   in a lab, I'd be a little bit skeptical.
[01:10:28.540 --> 01:10:32.100]   'Cause I could see bacteria doesn't survive
[01:10:32.100 --> 01:10:34.220]   in this kinds of temperature.
[01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:36.220]   But then I'd be like, I don't know, I don't know.
[01:10:36.220 --> 01:10:39.540]   - Is there enough, right, are there other options?
[01:10:39.540 --> 01:10:41.580]   Like, you know, is the condition rich enough?
[01:10:41.580 --> 01:10:42.540]   - Rich enough, yeah.
[01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:44.140]   - You know, there's an alternative view, though,
[01:10:44.140 --> 01:10:46.340]   which is there's this great book
[01:10:46.340 --> 01:10:48.180]   by Kim Stanley Robinson called Aurora.
[01:10:48.180 --> 01:10:51.500]   You know, so there's been a million century ship stories,
[01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:54.220]   like where Earth sends out a generation ship
[01:10:54.220 --> 01:10:56.340]   or century ship, and it goes to another planet,
[01:10:56.340 --> 01:10:58.060]   and they land, and they colonize.
[01:10:58.060 --> 01:10:59.700]   And on this one, they get all the way there,
[01:10:59.700 --> 01:11:01.700]   and they think the planet's gonna be habitable.
[01:11:01.700 --> 01:11:04.360]   And it turns out that it's not habitable for Earth life.
[01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:08.220]   Like, there's bacteria, or prions, actually,
[01:11:08.220 --> 01:11:12.100]   that just kill people in the simplest way.
[01:11:12.100 --> 01:11:14.180]   And the important thing about this book
[01:11:14.180 --> 01:11:18.020]   was the idea that life is actually very tied to its planet.
[01:11:18.020 --> 01:11:19.220]   It may not be so easy.
[01:11:19.220 --> 01:11:20.620]   I just thought this was a really interesting idea.
[01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:21.980]   I'm not saying I'm necessarily supporting it,
[01:11:21.980 --> 01:11:26.500]   but that actually life reflects the planetary conditions.
[01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:29.220]   Not the planetary, the planet itself, the whole lineage,
[01:11:29.220 --> 01:11:31.020]   the whole history of the biosphere.
[01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:33.840]   And it may not be so easy to just sort of be like,
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:35.780]   oh, just drop it over here, and it'll, you know.
[01:11:35.780 --> 01:11:37.380]   'Cause the bacteria, even though they're
[01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:40.260]   individual examples of life, and I kind of believe this,
[01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:43.820]   the true unit of life, it's not DNA, it's not a cell,
[01:11:43.820 --> 01:11:47.900]   it's the biosphere, it's the whole community, yeah.
[01:11:47.900 --> 01:11:49.980]   - That's actually an interesting field of study,
[01:11:49.980 --> 01:11:53.180]   is how, when you arrive from one planet to another,
[01:11:53.180 --> 01:11:56.420]   so we humans arrive to a planet that has a biosphere,
[01:11:56.420 --> 01:12:00.000]   maybe a technosphere, what is the way
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:05.000]   to integrate without killing yourself or--
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.860]   - Or the other one.
[01:12:06.860 --> 01:12:08.140]   - Or the other one.
[01:12:08.140 --> 01:12:11.260]   Let's stick to biology, that's an interesting question.
[01:12:11.260 --> 01:12:15.940]   I don't know if we have a rigorous way
[01:12:15.940 --> 01:12:18.340]   of investigating that.
[01:12:18.340 --> 01:12:21.300]   Because everything on life has the same lineage.
[01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:24.420]   We all come from Luca, the last universal common ancestor.
[01:12:24.420 --> 01:12:25.740]   And what you see is often in science fiction,
[01:12:25.740 --> 01:12:27.740]   people will do things like, oh, well, it's okay,
[01:12:27.740 --> 01:12:32.220]   because that metabolism, that biochemistry
[01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:34.140]   is so different from ours that we can coexist
[01:12:34.140 --> 01:12:37.200]   because they don't even know each other, right?
[01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:38.640]   And then the other version is, you get there,
[01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:41.640]   you land, and instantly, the nose bleeds, and you're dead.
[01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:43.180]   (laughing)
[01:12:43.180 --> 01:12:44.860]   - Unfortunately, I think it's the latter.
[01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:48.300]   - Yeah, it sort of feels like an alien kind of thing.
[01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:52.300]   - So as we look out there, according to the Drake equations
[01:12:52.300 --> 01:12:54.700]   we just discussed, it seems impossible to me
[01:12:54.700 --> 01:12:56.780]   that there's not civilizations everywhere.
[01:12:56.780 --> 01:12:59.620]   So how do we look at them, this process of SETI?
[01:12:59.620 --> 01:13:01.980]   - I have to put on my scientist hat and just say,
[01:13:01.980 --> 01:13:05.180]   my gut feeling is that dumb life, so to speak, is common.
[01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:07.660]   I am a little agnostic about, I can see ways
[01:13:07.660 --> 01:13:10.740]   in which intelligent civilizations may be sparse.
[01:13:10.740 --> 01:13:12.360]   But until you know, we gotta go look.
[01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:15.900]   It's all armchair astronomy.
[01:13:15.900 --> 01:13:17.980]   - That's from a sort of rigorous scientific perspective.
[01:13:17.980 --> 01:13:20.940]   From my bro-science perspective, it seems, again,
[01:13:20.940 --> 01:13:24.420]   smoking the aforementioned weed, it's--
[01:13:24.420 --> 01:13:25.540]   - After the bong hit, it seems so.
[01:13:25.540 --> 01:13:29.740]   - I mean, honestly, it's really just seems impossible
[01:13:29.740 --> 01:13:33.660]   to me that there's not potentially dead,
[01:13:33.660 --> 01:13:36.660]   but advanced civilizations everywhere in our galaxy.
[01:13:36.660 --> 01:13:38.660]   - Yeah, yeah, the potentially dead part, I think, right.
[01:13:38.660 --> 01:13:41.500]   It could be that making civilizations is easy,
[01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:42.540]   they just don't last long.
[01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:43.660]   So when we went out there,
[01:13:43.660 --> 01:13:45.620]   we'd find a lot of extinct civilizations.
[01:13:45.620 --> 01:13:47.580]   - Extinct civilizations.
[01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:49.460]   - Yeah, apex predators don't survive.
[01:13:49.460 --> 01:13:51.260]   Like, they get better, better, better, better,
[01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:54.280]   and they die, kill themselves off somehow.
[01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:56.780]   Anyway, so just how do we find them?
[01:13:56.780 --> 01:14:00.020]   - Yeah, so SETI, Search for Extraterrestrial Technology,
[01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:04.060]   is a term that I am not fond of using anymore.
[01:14:04.060 --> 01:14:07.300]   I mean, some people in my field are, so I'm sorry, folks.
[01:14:07.300 --> 01:14:09.660]   But I'm really, what I really like is the idea
[01:14:09.660 --> 01:14:12.100]   of technosignatures, 'cause I think, you know,
[01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:14.460]   to me, SETI is the, first of all, intelligence.
[01:14:14.460 --> 01:14:15.580]   We're not really looking for intelligence,
[01:14:15.580 --> 01:14:16.700]   we're looking for technology.
[01:14:16.700 --> 01:14:17.540]   I mean, you know.
[01:14:17.540 --> 01:14:21.700]   And SETI, the classic idea of SETI is the radio telescopes,
[01:14:21.700 --> 01:14:24.540]   you know, and contact, Jodie Foster with the headphones.
[01:14:24.540 --> 01:14:27.060]   That whole thing is still part, it's still active,
[01:14:27.060 --> 01:14:28.420]   there's still great things going on with it,
[01:14:28.420 --> 01:14:30.740]   but suddenly this whole new window opened up.
[01:14:30.740 --> 01:14:32.700]   When we discovered exoplanets,
[01:14:32.700 --> 01:14:35.700]   we now found a new way to look
[01:14:35.700 --> 01:14:39.180]   for intelligent civilizations, or life in general,
[01:14:39.180 --> 01:14:41.460]   in a way that doesn't have any of the assumptions
[01:14:41.460 --> 01:14:43.780]   that had to go into the classic radio SETI.
[01:14:43.780 --> 01:14:45.660]   And specifically what I mean is,
[01:14:45.660 --> 01:14:47.820]   we're not looking for somebody sending us a beacon.
[01:14:47.820 --> 01:14:51.020]   You really needed that with the classic model,
[01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:52.500]   for a bunch of different reasons.
[01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:54.340]   You had to assume they wanted to be found
[01:14:54.340 --> 01:14:56.500]   and they were sending you a super powerful beacon.
[01:14:56.500 --> 01:14:59.740]   Now, because we know exactly where to look,
[01:14:59.740 --> 01:15:01.740]   and we know exactly how to look,
[01:15:01.740 --> 01:15:05.420]   we can just go about looking for passive signatures
[01:15:05.420 --> 01:15:06.740]   of the civilization,
[01:15:06.740 --> 01:15:10.260]   going about its civilization-ing business, you know,
[01:15:10.260 --> 01:15:12.940]   without asking whether they want to be contacted or not.
[01:15:12.940 --> 01:15:16.820]   So this is what we call a biosignature or a technosignature.
[01:15:16.820 --> 01:15:20.860]   It is an imprint in the light from the planet
[01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:23.380]   of the activity of a biosphere or a technosphere.
[01:15:23.380 --> 01:15:24.220]   And that's really important.
[01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:26.900]   You know, that is why kind of the whole Gaia idea
[01:15:26.900 --> 01:15:28.780]   ends up being astrobiological,
[01:15:28.780 --> 01:15:32.580]   that biospheres and technospheres are so potent,
[01:15:32.580 --> 01:15:34.700]   they change the entire planet.
[01:15:34.700 --> 01:15:36.740]   And you can see that from 20 light years.
[01:15:36.740 --> 01:15:39.580]   So let's give an example of a biosignature to start off with,
[01:15:39.580 --> 01:15:42.380]   which would be a signature of a biosphere.
[01:15:42.380 --> 01:15:43.860]   Oxygen, right?
[01:15:43.860 --> 01:15:46.140]   On Earth, at least, we know that oxygen
[01:15:46.140 --> 01:15:49.220]   is only in the atmosphere because life put it there.
[01:15:49.220 --> 01:15:51.460]   If life went away, the oxygen,
[01:15:51.460 --> 01:15:53.860]   and particularly oxygen and methane, that pair,
[01:15:53.860 --> 01:15:56.140]   they would disappear, you know, very quickly.
[01:15:56.140 --> 01:15:58.180]   They'd react away, they'd all be gone.
[01:15:58.180 --> 01:16:01.660]   So if you find a planet with oxygen and methane,
[01:16:01.660 --> 01:16:05.620]   that's a good bet that there's a biosphere there.
[01:16:05.620 --> 01:16:07.340]   Okay, what about technospheres?
[01:16:07.340 --> 01:16:09.060]   Technospheres, this is what, you know,
[01:16:09.060 --> 01:16:11.820]   so I'm the principal investigator on the first grant
[01:16:11.820 --> 01:16:13.340]   NASA has ever given
[01:16:13.340 --> 01:16:16.620]   to do these kind of exoplanet technosignatures.
[01:16:16.620 --> 01:16:18.740]   NASA was kind of, for reasons we can talk about,
[01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:20.620]   NASA had gotten pretty gun-shy
[01:16:20.620 --> 01:16:23.140]   about funding anything about intelligent life.
[01:16:23.140 --> 01:16:25.700]   But okay, what's an example of a technosignature?
[01:16:25.700 --> 01:16:27.980]   Well, one could be atmospheric pollution.
[01:16:27.980 --> 01:16:29.740]   I'm gonna put pollution in quotes here
[01:16:29.740 --> 01:16:30.900]   'cause it doesn't have to be pollution,
[01:16:30.900 --> 01:16:33.140]   but gases like chlorofluorocarbons.
[01:16:33.140 --> 01:16:34.500]   So we've dumped, you know,
[01:16:34.500 --> 01:16:36.740]   we dumped a huge amount of chlorofluorocarbons
[01:16:36.740 --> 01:16:38.820]   into the atmosphere by mistake.
[01:16:38.820 --> 01:16:40.260]   It was affecting the ozone,
[01:16:40.260 --> 01:16:42.300]   but we put so much in there that actually,
[01:16:42.300 --> 01:16:43.140]   this is one of the things we did,
[01:16:43.140 --> 01:16:44.500]   we did a paper where we showed
[01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:47.220]   you could detect it across interstellar distances.
[01:16:47.220 --> 01:16:49.380]   You could look at the atmosphere,
[01:16:49.380 --> 01:16:51.860]   look at the light coming from a distant planet,
[01:16:51.860 --> 01:16:53.540]   pass the light through a spectrograph
[01:16:53.540 --> 01:16:56.300]   and see the spectral lines, the fingerprint,
[01:16:56.300 --> 01:16:59.780]   the spectral fingerprint of chlorofluorocarbons
[01:16:59.780 --> 01:17:00.780]   in an atmosphere.
[01:17:00.780 --> 01:17:02.940]   And that would for sure tell you
[01:17:02.940 --> 01:17:05.480]   that there was a technological civilization there
[01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:08.480]   because there's no other way to make chlorofluorocarbons
[01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:11.580]   except through some kind of industrial process.
[01:17:11.580 --> 01:17:13.500]   - So you're looking for, in the case of the biosphere,
[01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:17.860]   you're looking for anomalies in the spectrograph.
[01:17:17.860 --> 01:17:19.540]   - I wouldn't necessarily call these anomalies.
[01:17:19.540 --> 01:17:22.460]   I'm looking for things that, for biosignature,
[01:17:22.460 --> 01:17:24.980]   I'm looking for things that a geosphere, right,
[01:17:24.980 --> 01:17:27.680]   you know, that just rock and air wouldn't produce
[01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:28.520]   on its own.
[01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:29.900]   - What kind of chemicals would life produce?
[01:17:29.900 --> 01:17:31.340]   - Right, and that's part of the,
[01:17:31.340 --> 01:17:32.820]   that's the interesting thing, right?
[01:17:32.820 --> 01:17:33.660]   So that's what, you know,
[01:17:33.660 --> 01:17:35.260]   so we can use Earth as an example, right?
[01:17:35.260 --> 01:17:36.340]   We can say, look, oxygen,
[01:17:36.340 --> 01:17:38.560]   we know there would be no oxygen in the atmosphere
[01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:40.440]   if it wasn't for dimethyl sulfide,
[01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:43.400]   which is a compound that phyloplankton
[01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:44.800]   dump into the atmosphere, a lot of it.
[01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:46.160]   That's sometimes mentioned.
[01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:47.000]   And there was even,
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:48.320]   there was a paper that somebody wrote
[01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:50.720]   where it was like, well, we're not saying we see it,
[01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:52.600]   but, you know, there's a bunch of noise
[01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:54.760]   in the spectra right there.
[01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:57.280]   So, you know, there's a whole list of things
[01:17:57.280 --> 01:17:59.580]   that Earth has done that are in the atmosphere
[01:17:59.580 --> 01:18:00.840]   that might be biosignatures.
[01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:02.800]   But now we're reaching an interesting point.
[01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:04.220]   The field has matured to the point
[01:18:04.220 --> 01:18:07.840]   where we can start asking about agnostic biosignatures,
[01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:11.180]   things that have nothing to do with Earth's history.
[01:18:11.180 --> 01:18:14.200]   But we think that that would still be indications
[01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:16.840]   of this weirdness we call life, right?
[01:18:16.840 --> 01:18:19.840]   What is it in general that life does
[01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:20.920]   that leaves an imprint?
[01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:23.180]   So one of these things could be the structure
[01:18:23.180 --> 01:18:25.880]   of the network of chemical reactions,
[01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:28.280]   that biology always produces very different
[01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:30.320]   chemical networks, who's reacting with who,
[01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:32.740]   than just rock and water, right?
[01:18:32.740 --> 01:18:36.760]   So there's been some proposals for networked,
[01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:39.400]   you know, biosignatures.
[01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:41.000]   Information theory, you can use,
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:42.400]   you can try and look at the information
[01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:45.900]   that is in the different compounds
[01:18:45.900 --> 01:18:48.120]   that you find in the atmosphere.
[01:18:48.120 --> 01:18:50.120]   And maybe that information shows you like,
[01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:51.600]   oh, there's too much information here,
[01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:54.120]   there must've been biology happening, it's not just rock.
[01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:55.080]   Same thing for techno,
[01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:56.520]   that's what we're working on right now,
[01:18:56.520 --> 01:18:58.680]   that for technosignatures as well.
[01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:01.800]   - So how do you detect technosignatures?
[01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:03.100]   - Okay, so with technosignatures,
[01:19:03.100 --> 01:19:04.780]   I gave the example of chlorofluorocarbons,
[01:19:04.780 --> 01:19:06.100]   so that would be an example of,
[01:19:06.100 --> 01:19:08.240]   and again, that one is a non-agnostic one,
[01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:09.080]   because we sort of like,
[01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:10.980]   oh, we produced chlorofluorocarbons,
[01:19:10.980 --> 01:19:12.260]   maybe they will, right?
[01:19:12.260 --> 01:19:13.980]   And there's solar panels, right?
[01:19:13.980 --> 01:19:17.320]   You can actually, the glint off of solar panels
[01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:19.860]   will produce the way the light is reflected
[01:19:19.860 --> 01:19:21.260]   off of solar panels,
[01:19:21.260 --> 01:19:23.340]   no matter what it's made out of, actually.
[01:19:23.340 --> 01:19:25.620]   There was a paper that Manasvi Lingam
[01:19:25.620 --> 01:19:28.620]   and Avi Loeb did in, I think it was 2017,
[01:19:28.620 --> 01:19:29.900]   we've just followed up on it.
[01:19:29.900 --> 01:19:32.200]   That actually could act as a technosignature.
[01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:34.240]   You'd be able to see in the reflected light,
[01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:36.320]   this sort of big jump that would occur
[01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:40.840]   because of city lights, artificial illumination.
[01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:44.380]   If there's really like large scale cities,
[01:19:44.380 --> 01:19:48.520]   like Coruscant in Star Wars or Trent or in the foundation,
[01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:51.280]   those city lights would be detectable,
[01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:55.320]   the spectral imprint of those across 20, 30 light years.
[01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:57.760]   So our job in this grant is to develop
[01:19:57.760 --> 01:20:00.760]   the first ever library of technosignatures.
[01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:03.040]   Nobody's really ever thought about this before.
[01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:07.000]   So we're trying to come up with all the possible ideas
[01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.200]   for what a civilization might produce
[01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:13.560]   that could be visible across interstellar distances.
[01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:15.480]   And are these good ones,
[01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:17.280]   or is these ones gonna be hard to detect or such?
[01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:18.360]   - City lights.
[01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:22.100]   So if a planet is all lit up with artificial light
[01:20:22.100 --> 01:20:25.080]   across 20 to 30 light years, we can see it.
[01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:26.720]   - Yeah, if you looked at earth at night
[01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:29.480]   from a distance where, looked at its spectra
[01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:31.880]   and you had sensitive enough instruments,
[01:20:31.880 --> 01:20:33.200]   you'd be able to see all the sodium lights
[01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:34.680]   and the reflected light off of,
[01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:37.160]   they bounce off the ground, right?
[01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:38.360]   That the light bounces off the ground.
[01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:41.680]   So you'd convolve the sodium lamps
[01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:43.880]   with the reflected spectra from the ground.
[01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:45.880]   And yeah, you'd be able to see that there's city lights.
[01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:48.960]   Now increase that by a factor of a thousand,
[01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:52.260]   if you had a Trantor and you'd be able to detect that
[01:20:52.260 --> 01:20:53.560]   across interstellar distances.
[01:20:53.560 --> 01:20:56.540]   Thomas Beedick did this work, who's now working with us.
[01:20:56.540 --> 01:21:00.440]   - What do you think is the most detectable thing about earth?
[01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:02.720]   - Well, we just, this is fun.
[01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:04.320]   We just have a Sophia Schiff,
[01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:06.000]   just who's part of our collaboration, just did a paper.
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:07.160]   We did earth from earth.
[01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:10.880]   If you were looking at earth with earth technology
[01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:12.800]   for a bunch of different technosignatures,
[01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:15.600]   how close would you have to be to be able to detect them?
[01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:17.000]   And most of them turn out to be,
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.220]   you'd have to be pretty close, at least out to the Oort cloud.
[01:21:19.220 --> 01:21:21.760]   But actually it is our radio signatures still,
[01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:23.400]   that is still most detectable.
[01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:25.040]   - By the way, when you said you had to be pretty close
[01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:26.320]   and then you said the Oort cloud,
[01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:27.180]   that's not very close.
[01:21:27.180 --> 01:21:29.100]   But you mean like from an interstellar distance?
[01:21:29.100 --> 01:21:29.940]   - Interstellar distance.
[01:21:29.940 --> 01:21:31.660]   'Cause the real, we really wanna know is like,
[01:21:31.660 --> 01:21:32.500]   I'm sitting here on earth,
[01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:34.360]   I'm looking at these exoplanets.
[01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:36.540]   The nearest star is four light years away.
[01:21:36.540 --> 01:21:38.840]   So that's like the minimum distance.
[01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:42.160]   So what can, if I'm looking at exoplanets,
[01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:44.100]   what kind of signals could I see?
[01:21:44.100 --> 01:21:46.380]   - What is detectable about earth
[01:21:46.380 --> 01:21:49.740]   with our current technology from our nearest solar system?
[01:21:49.740 --> 01:21:51.020]   - Oh my God, there's all kinds of stuff.
[01:21:51.020 --> 01:21:54.380]   Well, like our, the chlorofluorocarbons,
[01:21:54.380 --> 01:21:55.960]   you can see, you know, you can see earth's pollution.
[01:21:55.960 --> 01:21:57.800]   And you know, I think city lights,
[01:21:57.800 --> 01:22:01.680]   you had to be within, you know, within the solar system.
[01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:04.120]   - If they do direct imaging of earth.
[01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:06.040]   - They're gonna need much more powerful.
[01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:06.880]   But let me tell you what things,
[01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:08.720]   let's talk about direct imaging for a moment,
[01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:09.560]   'cause I just have to go on.
[01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:10.720]   This is such a cool idea, right?
[01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:11.800]   So what we really want,
[01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:14.760]   and the next generation of space telescopes and such,
[01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:16.200]   is we're trying to do direct imaging.
[01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:17.960]   We're trying to get, you know,
[01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:20.840]   an image of a planet separated from its star
[01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:22.480]   to be able to see the reflected light
[01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:24.540]   or the actual emission from the planet itself.
[01:22:24.540 --> 01:22:26.580]   - Yeah, by the way, just to clarify,
[01:22:26.580 --> 01:22:29.100]   direct imaging means literally like a picture.
[01:22:29.100 --> 01:22:29.940]   - A picture.
[01:22:29.940 --> 01:22:31.300]   But the problem is, is that with the,
[01:22:31.300 --> 01:22:35.300]   even with the thing that's gonna come after JWST,
[01:22:35.300 --> 01:22:36.560]   it's gonna be a pixel, right?
[01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:38.060]   You're not gonna get any kind of resolution.
[01:22:38.060 --> 01:22:39.340]   You'll be able to get the light from it,
[01:22:39.340 --> 01:22:40.860]   which you'll be able to pass through a spectrograph,
[01:22:40.860 --> 01:22:42.520]   but you're not gonna be able to take a picture.
[01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:43.940]   But there is this idea
[01:22:43.940 --> 01:22:46.740]   called the Solar Gravity Lens Telescope.
[01:22:46.740 --> 01:22:47.700]   I think that's what it is.
[01:22:47.700 --> 01:22:49.500]   And the idea is insane, right?
[01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:50.820]   So their general relativity says,
[01:22:50.820 --> 01:22:52.700]   look, massive bodies distort space.
[01:22:52.700 --> 01:22:55.020]   They actually curve space-time.
[01:22:55.020 --> 01:22:57.940]   So the sun is a massive body.
[01:22:57.940 --> 01:23:00.060]   And so that means that the light passing through the sun
[01:23:00.060 --> 01:23:03.300]   gets focused like a lens, right?
[01:23:03.300 --> 01:23:05.900]   So the idea is to send a bunch of telescopes
[01:23:05.900 --> 01:23:08.060]   out kind of into the Oort cloud
[01:23:08.060 --> 01:23:10.460]   and then look back towards the sun,
[01:23:10.460 --> 01:23:12.740]   towards an exoplanet that is behind,
[01:23:12.740 --> 01:23:13.940]   not directly behind the sun,
[01:23:13.940 --> 01:23:16.140]   but is, you know, in the direction of the sun.
[01:23:16.140 --> 01:23:18.720]   And then let the sun act like a lens
[01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:22.540]   and collect, focus the light onto the telescope.
[01:23:22.540 --> 01:23:23.740]   And you would be able to get,
[01:23:23.740 --> 01:23:25.340]   and they've done, it's amazing.
[01:23:25.340 --> 01:23:27.240]   Like they've already, this idea is insane.
[01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:29.380]   They'd be able to get, if everything works out,
[01:23:29.380 --> 01:23:32.020]   24 kilometer resolution.
[01:23:32.020 --> 01:23:35.460]   You'd be able to see Manhattan on a exoplanet.
[01:23:35.460 --> 01:23:37.220]   And this thing, it sounds insane,
[01:23:37.220 --> 01:23:39.060]   but actually, you know, NASA, they've already got,
[01:23:39.060 --> 01:23:40.180]   the team has already gotten through
[01:23:40.180 --> 01:23:42.700]   like sort of three levels of NASA.
[01:23:42.700 --> 01:23:44.700]   You know, there's the NASA program for like,
[01:23:44.700 --> 01:23:46.540]   give us your wackiest idea, right?
[01:23:46.540 --> 01:23:48.840]   And then the ones that survive that are like, okay,
[01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:51.640]   tell us whether that wacky idea, you know, is even feasible.
[01:23:51.640 --> 01:23:53.080]   And then, and they're marching along.
[01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:55.600]   And the idea is that like, you know,
[01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:56.920]   and they even have plans for how you'd be able
[01:23:56.920 --> 01:23:59.800]   to get these probes out into the Oort cloud
[01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:01.760]   on relatively fast timescales.
[01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:04.080]   You need to be about 500 times
[01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:07.200]   as far from the sun as Earth is.
[01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:08.920]   But right now everything looks like,
[01:24:08.920 --> 01:24:10.240]   the idea seems to hold together.
[01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:12.620]   So probably when I'll be dead,
[01:24:12.620 --> 01:24:14.680]   but when you're an old man,
[01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:16.480]   it's possible that something like this
[01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:18.520]   could you imagine having like, yeah,
[01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:19.360]   that kind of resolution,
[01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:23.800]   a picture of an exoplanet down to, you know, kilometers.
[01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:25.800]   So I'm very excited about that.
[01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:28.760]   - I can only imagine having a picture like that.
[01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:32.480]   And then there's some mysterious artifacts
[01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:33.720]   that you're seeing.
[01:24:33.720 --> 01:24:34.560]   - Yeah.
[01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:39.560]   - I mean, it's both inspiring and almost heartbreaking
[01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:41.220]   that we can see, like,
[01:24:41.220 --> 01:24:44.960]   I think we'll be able to see a civilization
[01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:46.760]   where there's like a lot of scientists agree
[01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:48.720]   that this is very likely something,
[01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:49.680]   and then we can't.
[01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:50.800]   - We can't get there.
[01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:51.720]   But you know, I mean, again,
[01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:53.320]   this is the thing about being long lived.
[01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:56.400]   We've got to get to the point where we're long lived enough
[01:24:56.400 --> 01:24:57.720]   that, so let's say we found like,
[01:24:57.720 --> 01:24:58.560]   this is what I always like to,
[01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:01.800]   let's imagine that we find say 10 light years away,
[01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:03.820]   we find a planet that looks like
[01:25:03.820 --> 01:25:05.460]   it's got techno signatures, right?
[01:25:05.460 --> 01:25:06.300]   It doesn't end there.
[01:25:06.300 --> 01:25:08.160]   Like that would be the most important discovery
[01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:09.440]   in the history of humanity.
[01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:11.240]   And it wouldn't be like, well, okay, we're done.
[01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:12.840]   The first thing we do is we big,
[01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:15.320]   bigger telescope to try and do those imaging, right?
[01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:16.360]   And then the next thing after that,
[01:25:16.360 --> 01:25:17.820]   we plan a mission there, right?
[01:25:17.820 --> 01:25:20.120]   There's there, we would figure out,
[01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:23.640]   like with breakthrough star shot,
[01:25:23.640 --> 01:25:25.680]   there was this idea of trying to use, you know,
[01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:30.180]   giant lasers to propel small spacecrafts, light sails,
[01:25:30.180 --> 01:25:31.500]   almost to the speed of light.
[01:25:31.500 --> 01:25:33.920]   So they would get there in 10 years and take pictures.
[01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:34.880]   And so we'll, you know,
[01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:36.240]   if we actually made this discovery,
[01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:37.680]   there would be the impulse,
[01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:40.120]   there would be the effort to actually try
[01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:42.360]   and send something to get there.
[01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:44.680]   Now, you know, we probably couldn't land, we could,
[01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:48.860]   but you know, so maybe we take 30 years to build,
[01:25:48.860 --> 01:25:52.280]   10 years to get there, 10 years to get the picture back.
[01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:54.520]   Okay, you're dead, but your kids are, you know what I mean?
[01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:57.080]   So it becomes now this multi-generational project.
[01:25:57.080 --> 01:25:58.560]   How long did it take to build the pyramids?
[01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:01.360]   How long did it take to build the giant cathedrals, right?
[01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:03.720]   Those were multi-generational projects.
[01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:07.240]   And I think we're on the cusp of that kind of project.
[01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:09.440]   - I think that would probably unite humans.
[01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:11.000]   - I think it would play a big role.
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:11.840]   I think it would be helpful.
[01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:13.560]   I mean, human beings are a mess, let's face it.
[01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:15.320]   But I think having that record,
[01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:17.080]   that's why I always say to people,
[01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:18.600]   discovery of life of any kind of life,
[01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:20.760]   even if it was microbial life, it wouldn't matter,
[01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:22.560]   that to know that we're not an accident,
[01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:24.240]   to know that there is probably,
[01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:25.720]   if we found one example of life,
[01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:26.920]   we'd know that we're not an accident
[01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:28.480]   and there's probably lots of life
[01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:29.560]   and that we're a community.
[01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:32.400]   We're part of a cosmic kind of community of life.
[01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:34.920]   And who knows what life has done, right?
[01:26:34.920 --> 01:26:36.960]   We don't really, all bets are off with life.
[01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:39.800]   - Since we're talking about the future of telescopes,
[01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:43.000]   let's talk about our current super-sexy awesome telescope,
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:44.600]   the James Webb Space Telescope
[01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:46.240]   that I still can't believe actually worked.
[01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:47.080]   - I can't believe it worked.
[01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:48.760]   I was really skeptical.
[01:26:48.760 --> 01:26:51.800]   I was like, okay, guys, all right, sure.
[01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:55.240]   - We only got one shot for this incredibly complicated
[01:26:55.240 --> 01:26:57.720]   piece of hardware to unfold.
[01:26:57.720 --> 01:26:59.400]   So what kind of stuff can we see with it?
[01:26:59.400 --> 01:27:02.560]   I've been just looking through different kinds
[01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:04.040]   of announcements that have been detected.
[01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:06.000]   There's been some direct imaging.
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:07.640]   - Yes, like a single pixel.
[01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:10.840]   - The kinds of exoplanets we're able to direct image,
[01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:13.200]   I guess would have to be hot.
[01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:15.520]   - Hot, usually far away from the,
[01:27:15.520 --> 01:27:16.880]   reasonably far away from the star.
[01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:19.040]   I think JWST is really kind of at the hairy edge
[01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:20.440]   of being able to do much with this.
[01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:23.760]   What's more important, I think, for JWST is the spectra.
[01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:24.800]   And the problem with spectra is that
[01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:25.920]   there's not sexy pictures.
[01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:27.880]   It's like, hey, look at this wiggly line.
[01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:31.600]   But be able to find and characterize atmospheres
[01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:36.560]   around terrestrial exoplanets is the critical next step.
[01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:37.880]   That's where we are right now.
[01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:39.840]   In order to look for life, we're gonna be,
[01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:42.760]   we need to find planets with atmospheres, right?
[01:27:42.760 --> 01:27:44.000]   And then we need to be able to do this thing
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:45.920]   called characterization, where we look
[01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:48.880]   at the spectral fingerprints for what's in the atmosphere.
[01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:49.720]   Is there carbon?
[01:27:49.720 --> 01:27:50.560]   Is there carbon dioxide?
[01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:51.380]   Is there oxygen?
[01:27:51.380 --> 01:27:52.440]   Is there methane?
[01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:54.760]   And that's the most exciting thing.
[01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:57.320]   For example, there was this planet K2-18b,
[01:27:57.320 --> 01:28:00.760]   which they did a beautiful job getting the spectra.
[01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:03.760]   And the spectra indicated it may be an entirely new kind
[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:06.760]   of habitable world called a hycene world.
[01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:10.160]   Hycene meaning hydrogen ocean world.
[01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:13.280]   And that is a kind of planet that it would be a,
[01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:15.960]   you know, kind of in the super-Earth sub-Neptune domain
[01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:16.800]   we were talking about.
[01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:19.260]   You know, maybe eight times that mass of the Earth.
[01:28:19.260 --> 01:28:20.880]   But it's got a layer of hydrogen,
[01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:22.640]   of an atmosphere of hydrogen.
[01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:25.720]   Hydrogen is an amazing greenhouse gas.
[01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:29.240]   So hydrogen will keep the planet underneath it
[01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:31.280]   warm enough that you could get liquid water.
[01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:35.440]   You can get a giant ocean of liquid water.
[01:28:35.440 --> 01:28:37.840]   And that's an entirely different kind of planet
[01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:38.840]   that could be habitable planet.
[01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:41.820]   You know, it could be a 60 degree warm ocean.
[01:28:41.820 --> 01:28:46.280]   So the data that came out of JWST for that planet
[01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:48.600]   was good enough to be able to indicate like,
[01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:49.520]   oh yeah, you know what?
[01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:51.420]   The models, from what we understand about the models,
[01:28:51.420 --> 01:28:54.320]   this looks like it could be a hycene world.
[01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:57.280]   - And it's 120 light years away from Earth.
[01:28:57.280 --> 01:28:58.760]   - Yeah, and so isn't that amazing?
[01:28:58.760 --> 01:29:00.560]   You can, it's 120 light years away,
[01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:02.320]   but we can see into the atmosphere.
[01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:03.720]   We can see into the atmosphere so well
[01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:06.080]   that we can be like, oh look, methane.
[01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:08.480]   Methane was a five sigma detection.
[01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:10.560]   Like you knew that the data were so good
[01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:13.840]   that it was like the gold standard of science.
[01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:17.960]   - What about detecting, maybe through direct imaging
[01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:21.360]   or in other ways, megastructures
[01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:24.000]   that the civilizations build?
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:25.280]   - You know what's great about megastructures
[01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:26.600]   is first of all, it's fun to say.
[01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:27.880]   Who doesn't wanna say megastructure?
[01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:29.460]   Alien megastructure, right?
[01:29:29.460 --> 01:29:32.440]   Every morning I'm looking for an opportunity to say that.
[01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:36.240]   So the ur-example of this is the Dyson sphere, right?
[01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:38.520]   Which is amazing 'cause it was literally 1960
[01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:39.680]   that this idea came up.
[01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:40.640]   - Can you explain the Dyson sphere?
[01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:41.480]   - Yeah, the Dyson sphere.
[01:29:41.480 --> 01:29:44.880]   So Freeman Dyson, one of the greatest physicists ever,
[01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:46.360]   who was very broad-minded
[01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:47.440]   and thought about a lot of different things.
[01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:50.240]   He recognized that when a civilization,
[01:29:50.240 --> 01:29:51.640]   as civilizations progress,
[01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:53.480]   what they're gonna need is ever more energy
[01:29:53.480 --> 01:29:56.680]   to do ever more amazing things.
[01:29:56.680 --> 01:29:58.920]   And what's the best energy source in a solar system?
[01:29:58.920 --> 01:30:00.680]   It's the star, right?
[01:30:00.680 --> 01:30:05.280]   So if you surrounded the star with solar-collecting machines,
[01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:07.640]   sunlight-collecting machines,
[01:30:07.640 --> 01:30:10.400]   and the limit of this would be if you actually build a sphere
[01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:12.280]   an actual sphere around your star
[01:30:12.280 --> 01:30:14.000]   that had all solar panels on the inside,
[01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.980]   you could capture every photon the star produced,
[01:30:16.980 --> 01:30:19.240]   which is this insane amount of light.
[01:30:19.240 --> 01:30:21.680]   You would have enough power now to do anything,
[01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:24.080]   to re-engineer your solar system.
[01:30:24.080 --> 01:30:25.080]   So that was a Dyson sphere.
[01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:27.040]   It turns out that a Dyson sphere doesn't really work
[01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:28.440]   'cause it's unstable.
[01:30:28.440 --> 01:30:31.640]   But a Dyson swarm, and that's really what he meant,
[01:30:31.640 --> 01:30:35.980]   you know, this large collection of large orbiting structures
[01:30:35.980 --> 01:30:37.720]   that were able to collect light.
[01:30:37.720 --> 01:30:42.520]   - Yeah, so he didn't actually mean a rigid sphere structure.
[01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:44.080]   He basically meant a swarm.
[01:30:44.080 --> 01:30:45.960]   So that, like you said,
[01:30:45.960 --> 01:30:48.080]   and then the limit basically starts to look--
[01:30:48.080 --> 01:30:50.120]   - People started to say, yeah, it was like a sphere.
[01:30:50.120 --> 01:30:51.240]   And we actually almost thought
[01:30:51.240 --> 01:30:55.960]   we might've found one of these back with a Bajoran star.
[01:30:55.960 --> 01:30:57.800]   We saw, you know, the way we detect planets
[01:30:57.800 --> 01:30:59.000]   is through the transit method
[01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.160]   where the planet passes in front of the star
[01:31:01.160 --> 01:31:02.360]   and there's a dip in the starlight.
[01:31:02.360 --> 01:31:03.960]   It's a little eclipse basically.
[01:31:03.960 --> 01:31:05.720]   And we know exactly what they should look like.
[01:31:05.720 --> 01:31:06.960]   And then with this one star,
[01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:09.440]   there were these really weird transits
[01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:11.760]   where it was like this little dragon's tooth
[01:31:11.760 --> 01:31:13.440]   and then there'd be another one and another one
[01:31:13.440 --> 01:31:15.720]   and another one and then nothing and then three more.
[01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:18.600]   And in the paper that was written about this,
[01:31:18.600 --> 01:31:20.600]   they suggested, you know, they went through the list of,
[01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:23.520]   it could be comets, could be chunks of a broken up planet,
[01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:25.760]   and it could also be an alien megastructure.
[01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:27.280]   And of course the news picked up on this
[01:31:27.280 --> 01:31:29.520]   and like everybody's newsfeed the next day,
[01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:31.360]   alien megastructures discovered.
[01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:34.360]   Turns out, sadly, they were not alien megastructures.
[01:31:34.360 --> 01:31:37.080]   They were probably gas or dust clouds.
[01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:38.520]   But it raised the possibility like,
[01:31:38.520 --> 01:31:39.560]   oh, these are observable.
[01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:41.800]   And people have worked out the details
[01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:43.280]   of what they would look like.
[01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:44.480]   You don't really need direct imaging.
[01:31:44.480 --> 01:31:45.480]   You can do transits, right?
[01:31:45.480 --> 01:31:47.440]   They're big enough that when they pass in front of the star,
[01:31:47.440 --> 01:31:49.300]   they're gonna produce a little blip of light
[01:31:49.300 --> 01:31:50.320]   'cause that's what they're supposed to, right?
[01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:51.780]   They're absorbing starlight.
[01:31:51.780 --> 01:31:53.560]   So people have worked out like,
[01:31:53.560 --> 01:31:55.840]   well, a square one or a triangular one.
[01:31:55.840 --> 01:31:57.160]   - But that wouldn't be a Dyson sphere.
[01:31:57.160 --> 01:31:58.480]   That would be like one object.
[01:31:58.480 --> 01:31:59.320]   - One object, right.
[01:31:59.320 --> 01:32:00.600]   Which is what, if it's a swarm,
[01:32:00.600 --> 01:32:02.920]   you'd expect like the light to be like blinking in and out
[01:32:02.920 --> 01:32:04.800]   as these things pass in front of.
[01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:06.960]   You know, if you've got thousands of these,
[01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:09.200]   much of the time they'll be blotting out the star.
[01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:10.520]   Sometimes they won't be, right?
[01:32:10.520 --> 01:32:14.360]   And so you're gonna get an irregular sort of signal,
[01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:15.320]   transit signal.
[01:32:15.320 --> 01:32:17.200]   - Yeah, one you wouldn't expect from a star
[01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:18.200]   that doesn't have anything.
[01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:20.220]   - Exactly, or just a planet, right?
[01:32:20.220 --> 01:32:21.120]   Or a couple of planets.
[01:32:21.120 --> 01:32:22.520]   There'd be so many of these that it would be like,
[01:32:22.520 --> 01:32:24.760]   beep, beep, blip, blip, blip, blip, blip.
[01:32:24.760 --> 01:32:29.160]   - And that usually doesn't happen in a star system
[01:32:29.160 --> 01:32:31.840]   because there's only just a handful of planets.
[01:32:31.840 --> 01:32:32.680]   - That's exactly what it is.
[01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:33.520]   Everything's coagulated.
[01:32:33.520 --> 01:32:36.080]   In a stable solar system, you got a handful of planets,
[01:32:36.080 --> 01:32:39.660]   you know, five, 10, that's it probably, and nothing else.
[01:32:39.660 --> 01:32:42.000]   So if now suddenly you see lots of these
[01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:43.640]   little micro transits,
[01:32:43.640 --> 01:32:45.040]   you're telling you there's something else
[01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:47.180]   that's big enough to create a transit,
[01:32:47.180 --> 01:32:49.360]   but you know, too many of them.
[01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:52.240]   And also within a regular shape, the transit itself,
[01:32:52.240 --> 01:32:54.400]   that these could be megastructures.
[01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:58.160]   - How many people are looking for megastructures now?
[01:32:58.160 --> 01:33:01.880]   - Well, the main groups looking for megastructures
[01:33:01.880 --> 01:33:05.760]   are again, Jason Wright at Penn State and collaborators.
[01:33:05.760 --> 01:33:06.840]   The way they're looking for it though
[01:33:06.840 --> 01:33:07.960]   is for infrared light.
[01:33:07.960 --> 01:33:10.280]   Because, you know, the second law of thermodynamics says,
[01:33:10.280 --> 01:33:13.140]   look, if you capture all of this starlight,
[01:33:13.140 --> 01:33:15.280]   you're gonna warm up the, you know,
[01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:17.760]   your thing's gonna warm up and emit an infrared.
[01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:21.240]   It's gonna be waste heat, waste heat and waste light
[01:33:21.240 --> 01:33:22.080]   from this.
[01:33:22.080 --> 01:33:25.360]   - It feels like a louder, clearer way to detect it.
[01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:26.720]   - Right, and that's actually, you know, Dyson,
[01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:28.040]   that's actually why Dyson proposed it.
[01:33:28.040 --> 01:33:30.520]   He wasn't really proposing it because like he was saying,
[01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:32.320]   this is what civilizations are gonna do.
[01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:33.460]   He proposed it 'cause he was like,
[01:33:33.460 --> 01:33:36.160]   oh, we wanna start looking for alien civilizations.
[01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:39.940]   Here's something that would have a detectable signature.
[01:33:39.940 --> 01:33:42.780]   So Jason and company have done, you know,
[01:33:42.780 --> 01:33:43.840]   pretty good searches.
[01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:46.760]   And recently they made news because, you know,
[01:33:46.760 --> 01:33:48.680]   they were able to eliminate a lot of places.
[01:33:48.680 --> 01:33:49.720]   No, these are not Dyson spheres,
[01:33:49.720 --> 01:33:51.900]   but they did have a couple that were like anomalous enough
[01:33:51.900 --> 01:33:53.320]   that they're like, well,
[01:33:53.320 --> 01:33:54.660]   this is kind of what it would look like.
[01:33:54.660 --> 01:33:55.600]   It's not a detection.
[01:33:55.600 --> 01:33:56.440]   And they were saying,
[01:33:56.440 --> 01:33:57.560]   they would never say it's a detection,
[01:33:57.560 --> 01:34:00.160]   but they were like, they were not non-detections.
[01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:01.440]   - And they're potential candidates.
[01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:02.680]   - Potential candidates, yeah.
[01:34:02.680 --> 01:34:05.040]   - Love it, we have megastructure candidates.
[01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:06.360]   That's inspiring.
[01:34:06.360 --> 01:34:08.760]   What other megastructures do you think that could be?
[01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:10.520]   I mean, so that's Dyson spheres
[01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:12.400]   about capturing the energy of a star.
[01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:13.240]   - Yeah.
[01:34:13.240 --> 01:34:14.360]   - But there could be other--
[01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:17.300]   - Well, there's something called the Clark Belt, right?
[01:34:17.300 --> 01:34:18.800]   So we have a bunch of satellites
[01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:20.640]   that are in geosynchronous orbit.
[01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:22.360]   Nothing naturally is gonna end up
[01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:23.700]   in geosynchronous orbit, right?
[01:34:23.700 --> 01:34:25.420]   Geosynchronous orbit is one particular orbit
[01:34:25.420 --> 01:34:26.260]   that's really useful
[01:34:26.260 --> 01:34:27.780]   if you wanna beam things straight down
[01:34:27.780 --> 01:34:30.980]   or if you wanna put a space elevator up, right?
[01:34:30.980 --> 01:34:34.340]   So there's this idea that if a civilization
[01:34:34.340 --> 01:34:36.740]   becomes advanced enough
[01:34:36.740 --> 01:34:38.940]   that it's really using geosynchronous orbit,
[01:34:38.940 --> 01:34:39.960]   that you actually get a belt,
[01:34:39.960 --> 01:34:42.000]   something that would actually be detectable
[01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.260]   from a distance via a transit.
[01:34:44.260 --> 01:34:45.720]   There's been a couple of papers written
[01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:48.620]   about the possibility of these Clark belts,
[01:34:48.620 --> 01:34:52.420]   densely occupied Clark belts being a megastructure.
[01:34:52.420 --> 01:34:54.980]   It's not as mega as a Dyson swarm,
[01:34:54.980 --> 01:34:57.100]   but it's kind of planetary scale.
[01:34:57.100 --> 01:34:58.700]   - You think it's detectable, Clark belt?
[01:34:58.700 --> 01:34:59.540]   - It could be.
[01:34:59.540 --> 01:35:01.500]   I mean, like in our list of techno signatures,
[01:35:01.500 --> 01:35:02.700]   it would be down there,
[01:35:02.700 --> 01:35:03.700]   but it would be, again,
[01:35:03.700 --> 01:35:05.480]   if you had an advanced enough civilization
[01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:07.620]   that did enough of this,
[01:35:07.620 --> 01:35:09.880]   it would certainly, you'd have a Clark belt,
[01:35:09.880 --> 01:35:11.620]   and the question is whether or not it's detectable.
[01:35:11.620 --> 01:35:13.420]   - Yeah, probably Dyson sphere is the,
[01:35:13.420 --> 01:35:14.260]   that's the more exciting thing too.
[01:35:14.260 --> 01:35:15.100]   - That's the go-to one.
[01:35:15.100 --> 01:35:16.060]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:35:16.060 --> 01:35:17.380]   Speaking of the Dyson sphere,
[01:35:17.380 --> 01:35:19.060]   let's talk through the Kardashev scale.
[01:35:19.060 --> 01:35:19.980]   - Right.
[01:35:19.980 --> 01:35:23.940]   - What is the Kardashev scale and where are humans on it?
[01:35:23.940 --> 01:35:26.060]   - Right, so the Kardashev scale was the same time,
[01:35:26.060 --> 01:35:27.500]   this is this golden age of SETI,
[01:35:27.500 --> 01:35:31.660]   like kind of like '59 to '65 when it just starts.
[01:35:31.660 --> 01:35:33.460]   Like this is, you know,
[01:35:33.460 --> 01:35:35.940]   Frank Drake has done his first experiment.
[01:35:35.940 --> 01:35:38.540]   People are like, "Oh my God, this is even possible."
[01:35:38.540 --> 01:35:40.480]   And so people are just thrown out these ideas.
[01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:42.300]   And as I, you know, said in the book,
[01:35:42.300 --> 01:35:43.620]   science is conservative.
[01:35:43.620 --> 01:35:46.420]   And what I mean by that is it holds onto its best ideas.
[01:35:46.420 --> 01:35:48.260]   So Kardashev comes up with this idea that,
[01:35:48.260 --> 01:35:51.540]   look, if we're, again, it's always about detectability.
[01:35:51.540 --> 01:35:53.740]   If we're looking for civilizations,
[01:35:53.740 --> 01:35:55.100]   we should think about what are the state,
[01:35:55.100 --> 01:35:58.060]   what are the natural stages, natural in quotes,
[01:35:58.060 --> 01:35:59.820]   that a civilization goes through?
[01:35:59.820 --> 01:36:02.520]   And he was thinking in terms of energy use,
[01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:04.020]   which I like a good physicist.
[01:36:04.020 --> 01:36:09.020]   So the, he said, look, the first hurdle
[01:36:09.020 --> 01:36:11.380]   in terms of energy or threshold
[01:36:11.380 --> 01:36:12.660]   that a civilization will go through
[01:36:12.660 --> 01:36:15.980]   is using all the starlight that falls onto a planet.
[01:36:15.980 --> 01:36:18.320]   He called that a type one civilization.
[01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:19.620]   In whatever way you're doing it,
[01:36:19.620 --> 01:36:21.460]   some large fraction of the starlight
[01:36:21.460 --> 01:36:22.420]   that falls on your planet,
[01:36:22.420 --> 01:36:24.260]   you're using for your own ends.
[01:36:24.260 --> 01:36:26.640]   The next would be to use all the starlight
[01:36:26.640 --> 01:36:29.340]   there is from that star, right?
[01:36:29.340 --> 01:36:30.540]   So that's the Dyson sphere.
[01:36:30.540 --> 01:36:33.340]   So he actually, Dyson had already proposed
[01:36:33.340 --> 01:36:35.780]   his idea of the swarm and Kardashev was picking up.
[01:36:35.780 --> 01:36:37.860]   So that's a type two civilization.
[01:36:37.860 --> 01:36:40.300]   Type three is galactic scale,
[01:36:40.300 --> 01:36:42.780]   a civilization that could use all the starlight
[01:36:42.780 --> 01:36:44.220]   in a galaxy, right?
[01:36:44.220 --> 01:36:45.580]   So we are now, where are we now?
[01:36:45.580 --> 01:36:49.020]   Remarkably on a log scale, we're at 0.7 of a type one.
[01:36:49.020 --> 01:36:50.460]   - So we're not even type one.
[01:36:50.460 --> 01:36:51.880]   - No, no, no, we're not even type one.
[01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:56.700]   But according to, there was a paper written by a group
[01:36:56.700 --> 01:36:58.860]   that said, you know, if we continue on our path,
[01:36:58.860 --> 01:37:02.000]   we'll be at a type one at around 2300.
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:03.180]   - 2300. - Yeah.
[01:37:03.180 --> 01:37:05.220]   - So this is a log scale. - Yeah.
[01:37:05.220 --> 01:37:10.220]   - So 0.7, so type one is about 10 to the 16th watts.
[01:37:10.220 --> 01:37:14.660]   Type two is 10 orders of magnitude larger than that,
[01:37:14.660 --> 01:37:16.140]   10 to the 26th watts.
[01:37:16.140 --> 01:37:18.460]   And I think estimate for the galaxy
[01:37:18.460 --> 01:37:20.300]   is another 10 orders of magnitude.
[01:37:20.300 --> 01:37:22.460]   - Yeah, 'cause there's 100 billion star of order,
[01:37:22.460 --> 01:37:24.180]   100 billion stars, yeah.
[01:37:24.180 --> 01:37:27.360]   - So that's a lot. - That's a lot.
[01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:30.300]   - Do you think humans ever get to type one?
[01:37:30.300 --> 01:37:32.440]   - I think, you know, there's a problem with type one,
[01:37:32.440 --> 01:37:34.460]   which is that, you know, we already know about
[01:37:34.460 --> 01:37:35.300]   climate change, right?
[01:37:35.300 --> 01:37:37.780]   The effects of our harvesting energy
[01:37:37.780 --> 01:37:41.140]   to do the work of civilization is already changing
[01:37:41.140 --> 01:37:42.380]   the climate state, right?
[01:37:42.380 --> 01:37:43.740]   And that's something that, you know,
[01:37:43.740 --> 01:37:45.440]   Kardashev couldn't have recognized.
[01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:49.740]   When you, you know, there's the first law
[01:37:49.740 --> 01:37:51.280]   of thermodynamics, right?
[01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:53.060]   Which is just about energy, you know,
[01:37:53.060 --> 01:37:54.060]   the different forms of energy.
[01:37:54.060 --> 01:37:55.700]   Then there's the second law, which is about
[01:37:55.700 --> 01:37:57.220]   when you use that energy.
[01:37:57.220 --> 01:37:59.420]   And Kardashev wasn't thinking about the second law.
[01:37:59.420 --> 01:38:03.140]   If you get all that energy and you use it,
[01:38:03.140 --> 01:38:04.420]   there's waste heat.
[01:38:04.420 --> 01:38:05.780]   You don't get to use it all, right?
[01:38:05.780 --> 01:38:07.740]   You can only, second law tells you that if,
[01:38:07.740 --> 01:38:09.620]   you know, I have a tank of gasoline,
[01:38:09.620 --> 01:38:11.860]   I can only use a certain fraction of the energy
[01:38:11.860 --> 01:38:13.180]   in that tank and the rest is going to go
[01:38:13.180 --> 01:38:15.500]   to heating up the engine block.
[01:38:15.500 --> 01:38:17.660]   So that second law tells you that, you know,
[01:38:17.660 --> 01:38:21.140]   you can only use so much energy before the climate state
[01:38:21.140 --> 01:38:25.300]   is like, oh, you know, sorry, is going to change on you.
[01:38:25.300 --> 01:38:27.180]   So there's a way in which we probably can't get
[01:38:27.180 --> 01:38:30.780]   to a type one without like devastating the earth's climate.
[01:38:30.780 --> 01:38:33.540]   So we're probably going to have to figure out,
[01:38:33.540 --> 01:38:35.060]   the most important thing actually here is probably,
[01:38:35.060 --> 01:38:36.980]   this is why space becomes so at the colonization
[01:38:36.980 --> 01:38:38.300]   or settlement of space.
[01:38:38.300 --> 01:38:40.060]   If we have an idea that we've been working on for a while
[01:38:40.060 --> 01:38:42.020]   called service worlds, right?
[01:38:42.020 --> 01:38:44.380]   That at some point you probably move a lot
[01:38:44.380 --> 01:38:48.900]   of your industry off world, right?
[01:38:48.900 --> 01:38:50.580]   We've got Mercury, for example,
[01:38:50.580 --> 01:38:53.020]   there's nothing on Mercury, there's no life on Mercury.
[01:38:53.020 --> 01:38:55.540]   Why don't you put your energy harvesting there, right?
[01:38:55.540 --> 01:38:57.580]   Because you can't mess with the biosphere.
[01:38:57.580 --> 01:39:00.100]   The biosphere is more powerful than you are, right?
[01:39:00.100 --> 01:39:04.740]   And so, yeah, so there's limits to how much energy
[01:39:04.740 --> 01:39:07.940]   we can harvest to do work on the earth
[01:39:07.940 --> 01:39:10.660]   without really adversely affecting the biosphere.
[01:39:10.660 --> 01:39:13.780]   - It does seem that the best response to the climate change
[01:39:13.780 --> 01:39:15.340]   is not to use less technology,
[01:39:15.340 --> 01:39:17.900]   but to invent better technology
[01:39:17.900 --> 01:39:22.900]   and to invent technology that avoids the destructive effects.
[01:39:22.900 --> 01:39:26.260]   - This is the frontier we are.
[01:39:26.260 --> 01:39:27.780]   And that was the topic of my last book,
[01:39:27.780 --> 01:39:28.620]   "Light of the Stars."
[01:39:28.620 --> 01:39:31.660]   It's like you've got, you have to do the astrobiology
[01:39:31.660 --> 01:39:32.700]   of the Anthropocene.
[01:39:32.700 --> 01:39:35.060]   You have to see the transition that we're going through now
[01:39:35.060 --> 01:39:38.060]   of the Anthropocene on a kind of planetary
[01:39:38.060 --> 01:39:40.140]   astrobiological framework.
[01:39:40.140 --> 01:39:41.780]   And that paper we were talking about
[01:39:41.780 --> 01:39:43.540]   with the 10 billion trillion worlds,
[01:39:43.540 --> 01:39:45.820]   that was actually in service of the work I was doing
[01:39:45.820 --> 01:39:47.500]   for this other book where I wanted to know
[01:39:47.500 --> 01:39:50.300]   how often do you go through an Anthropocene?
[01:39:50.300 --> 01:39:52.660]   Does every technological civilization
[01:39:52.660 --> 01:39:55.340]   trigger its own planetary crisis,
[01:39:55.340 --> 01:39:57.420]   its own climate Anthropocene crisis?
[01:39:57.420 --> 01:39:59.420]   And the answer we actually came up from doing models
[01:39:59.420 --> 01:40:01.060]   was like, yeah, probably.
[01:40:01.060 --> 01:40:03.060]   And then the question is, are you smart enough
[01:40:03.060 --> 01:40:04.820]   to figure out how to readjust
[01:40:04.820 --> 01:40:06.460]   what you're doing technologically
[01:40:06.460 --> 01:40:08.780]   so that you're not, that all boats rise, right?
[01:40:08.780 --> 01:40:10.060]   You wanna figure out how to do this
[01:40:10.060 --> 01:40:13.100]   so that the biosphere becomes even more productive
[01:40:13.100 --> 01:40:15.700]   and healthy and resilient.
[01:40:15.700 --> 01:40:18.820]   So yeah, right, it's the kind of technology.
[01:40:18.820 --> 01:40:20.500]   I think there's probably absolutely limits
[01:40:20.500 --> 01:40:22.900]   on how much energy you can use,
[01:40:22.900 --> 01:40:24.500]   but how do you use that energy?
[01:40:24.500 --> 01:40:26.780]   And then also, yeah, getting off planet eventually.
[01:40:26.780 --> 01:40:30.100]   If you wanna use 10 times more energy than that,
[01:40:30.100 --> 01:40:33.140]   you're not gonna do it on world.
[01:40:33.140 --> 01:40:37.180]   - So how do we detect alien type one,
[01:40:37.180 --> 01:40:39.020]   two and three civilizations?
[01:40:39.020 --> 01:40:41.100]   So we've been kind of talking about
[01:40:41.100 --> 01:40:43.780]   basically type one civilization detection.
[01:40:43.780 --> 01:40:44.780]   - Yeah, right.
[01:40:44.780 --> 01:40:46.140]   - Maybe with the Dyson Sphere,
[01:40:46.140 --> 01:40:49.140]   you start to get like a little bit more type two,
[01:40:49.140 --> 01:40:52.260]   but it feels like if you have a type two civilization,
[01:40:52.260 --> 01:40:54.100]   it won't be just the Dyson Sphere.
[01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:55.340]   - Right.
[01:40:55.340 --> 01:40:58.140]   - It feels like that just for the same reason you mentioned,
[01:40:58.140 --> 01:41:02.700]   climate change, but now at the star system level,
[01:41:02.700 --> 01:41:04.780]   they're probably expanding, right?
[01:41:04.780 --> 01:41:08.060]   So how would you detect a type two?
[01:41:08.060 --> 01:41:10.380]   - How about propulsion plumes, right?
[01:41:10.380 --> 01:41:12.860]   If you're expanding, no, no, we just,
[01:41:12.860 --> 01:41:15.980]   I literally just put in a NASA proposal now.
[01:41:15.980 --> 01:41:17.220]   Thomas Beattie, who's joined us
[01:41:17.220 --> 01:41:19.260]   from the University of Wisconsin,
[01:41:19.260 --> 01:41:22.700]   has an idea to look for plumes, right?
[01:41:22.700 --> 01:41:27.500]   If you have a solar system wide civilization, right?
[01:41:27.500 --> 01:41:29.740]   And you got space truckers going back and forth, right?
[01:41:29.740 --> 01:41:31.020]   You know, from Mars to, you know,
[01:41:31.020 --> 01:41:33.260]   they're doing the Enceladus run.
[01:41:33.260 --> 01:41:35.540]   They're accelerating and decelerating
[01:41:35.540 --> 01:41:36.420]   the whole way there, right?
[01:41:36.420 --> 01:41:38.780]   If you wanna get to Mars in a couple of weeks,
[01:41:38.780 --> 01:41:42.740]   you have your fusion drive on the entire way out there,
[01:41:42.740 --> 01:41:44.860]   you flip and burn and have it on, you know,
[01:41:44.860 --> 01:41:47.860]   so you're also always have gravity, you have thrust gravity.
[01:41:47.860 --> 01:41:50.780]   So would those plumes be detectable?
[01:41:50.780 --> 01:41:52.820]   'Cause now you've got spaceships going all over the place
[01:41:52.820 --> 01:41:54.100]   and the odds that like, you know,
[01:41:54.100 --> 01:41:56.260]   the plume is gonna cross your field of view
[01:41:56.260 --> 01:41:58.100]   becomes, could become pretty high.
[01:41:58.100 --> 01:42:01.540]   So yeah, that's, I think that's a good way of looking for,
[01:42:01.540 --> 01:42:05.540]   that's one idea of looking for, you know,
[01:42:05.540 --> 01:42:08.180]   large scale interplanetary,
[01:42:08.180 --> 01:42:11.380]   which is kind of like when you're getting to a type two.
[01:42:11.380 --> 01:42:13.500]   Another possibility is looking for the tailings
[01:42:13.500 --> 01:42:14.700]   of asteroid mining.
[01:42:14.700 --> 01:42:18.740]   This was an idea, it was a group at Harvard Smithsonian
[01:42:18.740 --> 01:42:20.460]   that, you know, to be able to look for,
[01:42:20.460 --> 01:42:22.260]   if you're really chewing up asteroids
[01:42:22.260 --> 01:42:24.380]   to build space habitats, can, you know,
[01:42:24.380 --> 01:42:26.340]   there'd be dust particles left around
[01:42:26.340 --> 01:42:28.980]   and would they look different from just say the dust,
[01:42:28.980 --> 01:42:30.940]   you know, from just regular collisions?
[01:42:30.940 --> 01:42:32.700]   - So pollution of all different kinds.
[01:42:32.700 --> 01:42:33.700]   - Pollution of all different kinds.
[01:42:33.700 --> 01:42:34.900]   - And trash also?
[01:42:34.900 --> 01:42:36.580]   - Okay, so trash is an interesting idea
[01:42:36.580 --> 01:42:38.540]   when you come to the actual solar system, right?
[01:42:38.540 --> 01:42:41.260]   We are actually, there's a whole other field
[01:42:41.260 --> 01:42:44.540]   of technosignatures, which are things in the solar system.
[01:42:44.540 --> 01:42:47.820]   What if somebody came by a billion years ago,
[01:42:47.820 --> 01:42:50.700]   you know, and left some stuff, right?
[01:42:50.700 --> 01:42:52.720]   So the earth has been showing biosignatures
[01:42:52.720 --> 01:42:53.620]   for billions of years.
[01:42:53.620 --> 01:42:57.220]   And, you know, a species like us looking at our level,
[01:42:57.220 --> 01:42:59.060]   looking at earth would have been able to know
[01:42:59.060 --> 01:43:02.300]   that earth had life on it, had a biosphere
[01:43:02.300 --> 01:43:03.500]   for billions of years.
[01:43:03.500 --> 01:43:06.140]   So maybe somebody sent something by, you know,
[01:43:06.140 --> 01:43:07.740]   a half a billion years ago.
[01:43:07.740 --> 01:43:12.740]   So this idea of looking, say, at the moon for artifacts
[01:43:12.740 --> 01:43:14.660]   is that have been there for a long time
[01:43:14.660 --> 01:43:17.220]   is something that people, a number of people are doing.
[01:43:17.220 --> 01:43:19.360]   We're just working on a paper where we just calculate,
[01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:22.620]   this was super fun, we calculated how long
[01:43:22.620 --> 01:43:25.900]   would the lunar lander exist on the moon
[01:43:25.900 --> 01:43:28.780]   before micro meteorites just chewed it down, right?
[01:43:28.780 --> 01:43:30.260]   How long would you be able to land on the moon
[01:43:30.260 --> 01:43:32.380]   and go, oh, look, there's, you know,
[01:43:32.380 --> 01:43:34.940]   somebody was here and left some debris.
[01:43:34.940 --> 01:43:36.460]   So there's this process called gardening,
[01:43:36.460 --> 01:43:37.820]   which is just the micro meteorite,
[01:43:37.820 --> 01:43:40.180]   constant rain of micro meteorites, you know.
[01:43:40.180 --> 01:43:42.100]   And that's where you get the lunar regolith,
[01:43:42.100 --> 01:43:45.860]   that fine powder on the moon is because of this gardening.
[01:43:45.860 --> 01:43:48.900]   And it turns out it is literally hundreds of millions
[01:43:48.900 --> 01:43:50.580]   to billions of years. - Oh, nice.
[01:43:50.580 --> 01:43:54.780]   - That the, yeah, that the lunar lander will be visible.
[01:43:54.780 --> 01:43:57.460]   - Oh, so we should be able to find artifacts.
[01:43:57.460 --> 01:43:59.300]   - Yeah, if there are artifacts on,
[01:43:59.300 --> 01:44:00.660]   and people have proposed doing this
[01:44:00.660 --> 01:44:02.900]   with artificial intelligence.
[01:44:02.900 --> 01:44:04.780]   We have, you know, the moon has been mapped down
[01:44:04.780 --> 01:44:07.180]   to like a couple of meters with various probes
[01:44:07.180 --> 01:44:08.420]   and all that data is sitting there.
[01:44:08.420 --> 01:44:10.580]   So have, why not use machine learning
[01:44:10.580 --> 01:44:12.060]   to like look through all those things
[01:44:12.060 --> 01:44:15.580]   and look for anything that looks not like the lunar surface.
[01:44:15.580 --> 01:44:17.660]   And they did a test program where they gave it,
[01:44:17.660 --> 01:44:19.740]   they gave the computer, you know, sort of like,
[01:44:19.740 --> 01:44:22.380]   I don't know, 50 miles around the Apollo 11
[01:44:22.380 --> 01:44:24.540]   or Apollo, maybe it was Apollo 17 site.
[01:44:24.540 --> 01:44:27.420]   And it instantly was able to pull out the lander.
[01:44:27.420 --> 01:44:29.340]   - I mean, the whole task of looking for anomalies,
[01:44:29.340 --> 01:44:31.580]   something that looks not like the lunar surface,
[01:44:31.580 --> 01:44:34.460]   you make it sound obvious, but it's not exactly obvious.
[01:44:34.460 --> 01:44:39.460]   Like anomalies is really not, I mean,
[01:44:39.460 --> 01:44:42.200]   detect something that doesn't look right about this room.
[01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:43.620]   - Yeah. - It's actually
[01:44:43.620 --> 01:44:45.060]   really difficult. - Really difficult.
[01:44:45.060 --> 01:44:45.900]   It's really difficult.
[01:44:45.900 --> 01:44:46.720]   And it's, you know, what's cool,
[01:44:46.720 --> 01:44:49.980]   it's a really information theoretic kind of proposal.
[01:44:49.980 --> 01:44:51.700]   You really have to use information theory
[01:44:51.700 --> 01:44:52.940]   to say like, what's the background?
[01:44:52.940 --> 01:44:55.180]   What's, you know, well, how do I define something
[01:44:55.180 --> 01:44:57.300]   that I can say that looks weird?
[01:44:57.300 --> 01:44:58.380]   So.
[01:44:58.380 --> 01:45:00.340]   - Yeah, maybe when you're looking at a spectrograph
[01:45:00.340 --> 01:45:03.340]   or something like, it's still like,
[01:45:03.340 --> 01:45:07.500]   it's gonna look really weird potentially.
[01:45:07.500 --> 01:45:10.860]   Like we're kind of hypothesizing all the things
[01:45:10.860 --> 01:45:12.060]   that humans would build. - Right.
[01:45:12.060 --> 01:45:13.660]   - And how do we detect that? - Right.
[01:45:13.660 --> 01:45:15.500]   - But that could be really weird stuff.
[01:45:15.500 --> 01:45:16.740]   - That's why there's this emphasis now
[01:45:16.740 --> 01:45:19.540]   on these agnostic signatures, right?
[01:45:19.540 --> 01:45:22.100]   So actually disequilibrium is a nice one.
[01:45:22.100 --> 01:45:24.980]   One way to define life is it is a system
[01:45:24.980 --> 01:45:26.740]   that is far from equilibrium, right?
[01:45:26.740 --> 01:45:27.580]   It's alive, right?
[01:45:27.580 --> 01:45:29.660]   'Cause as soon as it dies, it turns into,
[01:45:29.660 --> 01:45:30.900]   it goes back to equilibrium.
[01:45:30.900 --> 01:45:33.620]   And so you can look at all chemicals in an atmosphere,
[01:45:33.620 --> 01:45:34.620]   even if you don't know whether,
[01:45:34.620 --> 01:45:36.100]   these could be chemicals that you have no idea
[01:45:36.100 --> 01:45:38.020]   whether or not they have anything to do with life.
[01:45:38.020 --> 01:45:40.300]   But the degree of disequilibrium,
[01:45:40.300 --> 01:45:43.500]   the degree to which they show that that atmosphere has not,
[01:45:43.500 --> 01:45:45.220]   you know, the chemicals have not all kind of like
[01:45:45.220 --> 01:45:46.660]   just gone down to a, you know,
[01:45:46.660 --> 01:45:49.640]   they've all reacted away to an equilibrium state.
[01:45:49.640 --> 01:45:51.900]   You can actually tell that in very general ways
[01:45:51.900 --> 01:45:54.460]   using what's called the Gibbs free energy.
[01:45:54.460 --> 01:45:55.860]   And that's kind of a signature.
[01:45:55.860 --> 01:45:57.260]   Like if you see an atmosphere
[01:45:57.260 --> 01:46:00.780]   that is wildly out of equilibrium, you know,
[01:46:00.780 --> 01:46:02.260]   that indicates that there's some,
[01:46:02.260 --> 01:46:04.140]   there's something happening on that planet,
[01:46:04.140 --> 01:46:08.140]   biosphere or technosphere that is pumping gases,
[01:46:08.140 --> 01:46:10.980]   you know, into the atmosphere
[01:46:10.980 --> 01:46:13.420]   that is keeping the whole system from relaxing.
[01:46:13.420 --> 01:46:17.460]   - So is it possible we can detect anomalies in space time?
[01:46:17.460 --> 01:46:18.580]   - Well, you could detect,
[01:46:18.580 --> 01:46:20.180]   and there's been some work on this,
[01:46:20.180 --> 01:46:21.660]   like with the Akubre drive, you know,
[01:46:21.660 --> 01:46:23.860]   these proposals for warp drives.
[01:46:23.860 --> 01:46:24.980]   And we can talk about that later.
[01:46:24.980 --> 01:46:27.540]   I'm skeptical of those, but,
[01:46:27.540 --> 01:46:28.660]   'cause it may really be possible
[01:46:28.660 --> 01:46:30.460]   you just can't go faster than the speed of light,
[01:46:30.460 --> 01:46:32.620]   but people have done work on like, you know,
[01:46:32.620 --> 01:46:37.500]   what would be the signature of an Akubre drive?
[01:46:37.500 --> 01:46:39.180]   What would be the signature?
[01:46:39.180 --> 01:46:40.020]   You're like, you know,
[01:46:40.020 --> 01:46:42.220]   could you detect if you're using a drive like that,
[01:46:42.220 --> 01:46:44.100]   then you certainly are distorting space time,
[01:46:44.100 --> 01:46:46.620]   which means any light that's passing by has gotten,
[01:46:46.620 --> 01:46:49.380]   you know, its trajectory has gotten altered
[01:46:49.380 --> 01:46:51.900]   because it had to pass through the distorted space time.
[01:46:51.900 --> 01:46:54.580]   So yeah, there are possibilities along with that.
[01:46:54.580 --> 01:46:55.460]   You know, one of the funny things,
[01:46:55.460 --> 01:46:56.580]   I don't know if they've gotten past this,
[01:46:56.580 --> 01:46:57.940]   but somebody calculated the problem
[01:46:57.940 --> 01:47:00.180]   with the Akubre drive, or this warp drive,
[01:47:00.180 --> 01:47:02.740]   was that if you dropped out of warp,
[01:47:02.740 --> 01:47:05.180]   there would be this spray of gamma rays
[01:47:05.180 --> 01:47:08.020]   that would like sterilize any planet in front of you.
[01:47:08.020 --> 01:47:09.180]   So it's like, well, yeah,
[01:47:09.180 --> 01:47:10.420]   you probably don't want to do that,
[01:47:10.420 --> 01:47:13.220]   but that would be a great bios or techno signature.
[01:47:13.220 --> 01:47:15.020]   Oh, another planet obliterated.
[01:47:15.020 --> 01:47:16.220]   - So you think it's not possible
[01:47:16.220 --> 01:47:17.340]   to travel faster than the speed of light?
[01:47:17.340 --> 01:47:18.700]   - I wouldn't say that, I wouldn't say that.
[01:47:18.700 --> 01:47:19.540]   But what I think, you know,
[01:47:19.540 --> 01:47:22.020]   if you look at the physics we understand, right?
[01:47:22.020 --> 01:47:22.860]   - Yeah.
[01:47:24.260 --> 01:47:27.860]   - Every possibility for faster than light travel
[01:47:27.860 --> 01:47:30.860]   really relies on something that doesn't exist, right?
[01:47:30.860 --> 01:47:34.300]   So, you know, the cool thing is Einstein's field equations.
[01:47:34.300 --> 01:47:35.860]   You can actually play with them.
[01:47:35.860 --> 01:47:36.700]   The equations are right there.
[01:47:36.700 --> 01:47:40.380]   You can add things to the right or left-hand side
[01:47:40.380 --> 01:47:43.340]   that allow you to get something like the Akubre drive.
[01:47:43.340 --> 01:47:45.340]   That was a metric that showed you like,
[01:47:45.340 --> 01:47:47.340]   oh, it's a warped bubble.
[01:47:47.340 --> 01:47:50.620]   It's a warping of space-time that moves through space-time
[01:47:50.620 --> 01:47:52.620]   faster than the speed of light, right?
[01:47:52.620 --> 01:47:54.980]   Because nothing can move across space-time
[01:47:54.980 --> 01:47:56.540]   faster than the speed of light,
[01:47:56.540 --> 01:47:58.820]   but space-time itself can move
[01:47:58.820 --> 01:48:00.420]   faster than the speed of light.
[01:48:00.420 --> 01:48:02.860]   But here's the problem with all of those proposals
[01:48:02.860 --> 01:48:03.860]   is they all need something.
[01:48:03.860 --> 01:48:05.900]   The thing you added, the little fictional term
[01:48:05.900 --> 01:48:08.100]   you added into the equations
[01:48:08.100 --> 01:48:11.380]   is something called exotic matter, and it doesn't exist.
[01:48:11.380 --> 01:48:12.900]   It's really just something we dreamed up
[01:48:12.900 --> 01:48:15.780]   to make the equation to do what we wanted them to do.
[01:48:15.780 --> 01:48:18.780]   So, you know, it's a nice fiction,
[01:48:18.780 --> 01:48:21.300]   but really right now, you know.
[01:48:21.300 --> 01:48:24.740]   You know, we live in this weird moment in history
[01:48:24.740 --> 01:48:26.020]   of the great acceleration,
[01:48:26.020 --> 01:48:30.260]   where like the technology we use now is, you know,
[01:48:30.260 --> 01:48:32.180]   is completely different from the technology
[01:48:32.180 --> 01:48:33.900]   we used 10 years ago,
[01:48:33.900 --> 01:48:36.700]   is remarkably different from the technology
[01:48:36.700 --> 01:48:38.620]   from a hundred years ago.
[01:48:38.620 --> 01:48:42.420]   But, you know, I remember playing Assassin's Creed
[01:48:42.420 --> 01:48:43.860]   where everybody's like, you know, what is it?
[01:48:43.860 --> 01:48:46.180]   It's 1200 and everybody's like, stab, stab, stab.
[01:48:46.180 --> 01:48:47.100]   And I was like, yeah, this is a great game.
[01:48:47.100 --> 01:48:49.700]   And then I got Assassin's Creed II,
[01:48:49.700 --> 01:48:52.260]   and it was 300 years later.
[01:48:52.260 --> 01:48:54.380]   And everybody's like, stab, stab, stab.
[01:48:54.380 --> 01:48:57.620]   And it was like 300 years and the technology hadn't changed.
[01:48:57.620 --> 01:49:00.420]   And that was actually true for most of human history, right?
[01:49:00.420 --> 01:49:03.660]   You used your great grandfather's tools
[01:49:03.660 --> 01:49:05.900]   because there was no need to have any other new tools.
[01:49:05.900 --> 01:49:07.740]   And you probably did his job.
[01:49:07.740 --> 01:49:10.340]   So, you know, we can be fooled into thinking like,
[01:49:10.340 --> 01:49:12.700]   oh, you know, technology is just gonna go on forever.
[01:49:12.700 --> 01:49:14.500]   We're always gonna find new advances
[01:49:14.500 --> 01:49:17.140]   as opposed to sometimes things just flatten out
[01:49:17.140 --> 01:49:17.980]   for a long time.
[01:49:17.980 --> 01:49:20.700]   So you have to be careful about that bias that we have
[01:49:20.700 --> 01:49:23.260]   living in this time of great acceleration.
[01:49:23.260 --> 01:49:26.260]   - Yeah, but also it is a great acceleration
[01:49:26.260 --> 01:49:29.420]   and we also are not good at predicting
[01:49:29.420 --> 01:49:32.180]   what that entails if it does keep accelerating.
[01:49:32.180 --> 01:49:34.980]   So for example, somebody like Eric Weinstein
[01:49:34.980 --> 01:49:37.100]   often talks about we under invest
[01:49:37.100 --> 01:49:40.940]   in theoretical physics research.
[01:49:40.940 --> 01:49:44.180]   Basically like we're trying too hard
[01:49:44.180 --> 01:49:48.060]   for traditional chemical propulsion on rockets
[01:49:48.060 --> 01:49:51.900]   versus like trying to hack physics,
[01:49:51.900 --> 01:49:53.900]   sort of warp drives and so on.
[01:49:53.900 --> 01:49:58.260]   Because it's really hard to do space travel.
[01:49:58.260 --> 01:50:00.620]   And it seems like in the long arc of human history,
[01:50:00.620 --> 01:50:03.460]   if we survive, the way to really travel
[01:50:03.460 --> 01:50:06.020]   across long distances is going to be some new,
[01:50:06.020 --> 01:50:07.060]   totally new thing.
[01:50:07.060 --> 01:50:07.900]   - Right, right.
[01:50:07.900 --> 01:50:11.300]   - So it's not going to be an engineering problem.
[01:50:11.300 --> 01:50:12.900]   It's going to be a physics.
[01:50:12.900 --> 01:50:14.220]   - A fundamental physics problem.
[01:50:14.220 --> 01:50:15.060]   - Fundamental physics problem.
[01:50:15.060 --> 01:50:17.140]   - Yeah, I mean, I agree with that in principle,
[01:50:17.140 --> 01:50:19.180]   but I think there's been, you know,
[01:50:19.180 --> 01:50:20.900]   I mean, there's a lot of ideas out there.
[01:50:20.900 --> 01:50:22.020]   People, you know, string theory,
[01:50:22.020 --> 01:50:25.100]   people have been playing with string theory now for 40 years.
[01:50:25.100 --> 01:50:26.500]   It's not like people haven't been,
[01:50:26.500 --> 01:50:28.260]   not like there hasn't been a lot of effort.
[01:50:28.260 --> 01:50:29.620]   And, you know, and again, I'm not going to predict.
[01:50:29.620 --> 01:50:32.140]   I think it's entirely possible that we have, you know,
[01:50:32.140 --> 01:50:34.900]   there's incredible boundaries of physics
[01:50:34.900 --> 01:50:37.220]   that have yet to be poked through.
[01:50:37.220 --> 01:50:39.660]   In which case then all bets are off, right?
[01:50:39.660 --> 01:50:41.580]   Once you get sort of, you know, interstellar,
[01:50:41.580 --> 01:50:43.700]   fast interstellar travel, whoa, you know,
[01:50:43.700 --> 01:50:45.500]   who knows what can happen.
[01:50:45.500 --> 01:50:49.340]   But I tend to be drawn to like science fiction stories
[01:50:49.340 --> 01:50:51.140]   that take the speed of light seriously.
[01:50:51.140 --> 01:50:53.020]   Like what kind of civilization can you build
[01:50:53.020 --> 01:50:55.140]   where like it takes, you know,
[01:50:55.140 --> 01:50:57.620]   50 years to get to where you're going
[01:50:57.620 --> 01:51:00.060]   and a 50 years back, like, so I don't know.
[01:51:00.060 --> 01:51:01.420]   I mean, yeah, there's no way I'm going to say
[01:51:01.420 --> 01:51:03.140]   that we won't get warp drives.
[01:51:03.140 --> 01:51:06.260]   But as of right now, there's, it's all fictional.
[01:51:06.260 --> 01:51:08.580]   It's, you know, it's barely even a coherent concept.
[01:51:08.580 --> 01:51:10.700]   - Well, it's also a really exciting possibility
[01:51:10.700 --> 01:51:14.480]   of hacking this whole thing by extending human lifespan
[01:51:14.480 --> 01:51:17.980]   or extending our notion of time.
[01:51:17.980 --> 01:51:20.620]   And maybe as dark as to say,
[01:51:20.620 --> 01:51:23.020]   but the value of an individual human life
[01:51:23.020 --> 01:51:25.380]   versus the value of life
[01:51:25.380 --> 01:51:27.380]   from the perspective of generations.
[01:51:27.380 --> 01:51:29.300]   So you can have something like a generational ship
[01:51:29.300 --> 01:51:31.820]   that travels for hundreds of thousands of years.
[01:51:31.820 --> 01:51:36.820]   And you're not sad that you'll never see the destination
[01:51:37.740 --> 01:51:39.380]   because you kind of have the value
[01:51:39.380 --> 01:51:43.860]   for the prolonged survival of humanity
[01:51:43.860 --> 01:51:45.260]   versus your own individual life.
[01:51:45.260 --> 01:51:46.100]   - Yeah.
[01:51:46.100 --> 01:51:47.620]   It's a wild ethical question, isn't it?
[01:51:47.620 --> 01:51:50.300]   One of the, that book I told you about, "Aurora."
[01:51:50.300 --> 01:51:51.540]   It was, I loved the book
[01:51:51.540 --> 01:51:55.060]   because it was such a sort of inversion of the usual.
[01:51:55.060 --> 01:51:56.580]   'Cause you know, I've read, I love science fiction.
[01:51:56.580 --> 01:51:58.540]   I've read so many generation ship stories.
[01:51:58.540 --> 01:51:59.700]   And they get to that planet.
[01:51:59.700 --> 01:52:01.780]   The planet turns out to be uninhabitable.
[01:52:01.780 --> 01:52:04.080]   It's inhabited, but it's uninhabitable for Earth.
[01:52:04.080 --> 01:52:06.380]   Because again, he has this idea of like, you know,
[01:52:06.380 --> 01:52:08.060]   life is particular to their planets.
[01:52:08.060 --> 01:52:09.780]   So they turn around and they come back.
[01:52:09.780 --> 01:52:12.820]   And then when they land, the main character goes,
[01:52:12.820 --> 01:52:13.800]   there's still people who are, you know,
[01:52:13.800 --> 01:52:15.540]   arguing for more generation ships.
[01:52:15.540 --> 01:52:17.700]   And she goes and she punches the guy out
[01:52:17.700 --> 01:52:20.180]   'cause she spent her whole life in a tube, you know,
[01:52:20.180 --> 01:52:23.300]   with this, I thought that was a really interesting inversion.
[01:52:23.300 --> 01:52:24.580]   You know, the interesting thing about,
[01:52:24.580 --> 01:52:26.420]   we were talking about these space habitats,
[01:52:26.420 --> 01:52:27.620]   but if you really had a space habit,
[01:52:27.620 --> 01:52:29.060]   not some super cramped, you know,
[01:52:29.060 --> 01:52:31.580]   crappy usual version of a century ship.
[01:52:31.580 --> 01:52:33.020]   But if you had these like space habitats
[01:52:33.020 --> 01:52:34.940]   that were really, you know, like the O'Neill cylinders,
[01:52:34.940 --> 01:52:37.420]   they're actually pretty nice places to live.
[01:52:37.420 --> 01:52:39.900]   Put a thruster on those, you know, like why,
[01:52:39.900 --> 01:52:41.100]   why keep them in the solar system?
[01:52:41.100 --> 01:52:43.540]   Maybe that's, maybe space is full of like
[01:52:43.540 --> 01:52:45.580]   these sort of traveling space habitats
[01:52:45.580 --> 01:52:47.200]   that are in some sense a, you know,
[01:52:47.200 --> 01:52:49.540]   they're worlds in and of themselves.
[01:52:49.540 --> 01:52:52.420]   There's the show Silo, which raises the question
[01:52:52.420 --> 01:52:55.280]   of basically if you're putting on a generational ship,
[01:52:55.280 --> 01:52:59.640]   what do you tell the inhabitants of that ship?
[01:52:59.640 --> 01:53:00.800]   You might want to lie to them.
[01:53:00.800 --> 01:53:01.640]   Yeah.
[01:53:01.640 --> 01:53:03.040]   You might want to tell them a story.
[01:53:03.040 --> 01:53:03.880]   Right.
[01:53:03.880 --> 01:53:04.700]   That they believe.
[01:53:04.700 --> 01:53:05.540]   Yeah.
[01:53:05.540 --> 01:53:07.060]   Because there is a society, there's human nature,
[01:53:07.060 --> 01:53:10.100]   there's like, how do you maintain a homeostasis
[01:53:10.100 --> 01:53:11.500]   of that little society?
[01:53:11.500 --> 01:53:15.540]   I mean, that's a fascinating technical question,
[01:53:15.540 --> 01:53:17.900]   the social question, the psychology question.
[01:53:17.900 --> 01:53:19.020]   You know, the generation ship too,
[01:53:19.020 --> 01:53:20.420]   and you know, which I talked about in the book,
[01:53:20.420 --> 01:53:22.140]   the idea of the, also the, you know,
[01:53:22.140 --> 01:53:24.260]   you talked about extending human lifetimes,
[01:53:24.260 --> 01:53:27.040]   or, you know, the stasis, the cryostasis,
[01:53:27.040 --> 01:53:29.340]   which is a mainstay of science fiction.
[01:53:29.340 --> 01:53:31.020]   You know, that, you know, right, you can be put to,
[01:53:31.020 --> 01:53:33.240]   you can basically put in suspended animation and such.
[01:53:33.240 --> 01:53:34.900]   None of these things we know are possible.
[01:53:34.900 --> 01:53:35.740]   But, you know, it's so interesting,
[01:53:35.740 --> 01:53:36.820]   and this is why I love science fiction,
[01:53:36.820 --> 01:53:39.160]   the way it seeds ideas, right?
[01:53:39.160 --> 01:53:40.500]   All these ideas we're going to talk about,
[01:53:40.500 --> 01:53:43.740]   because they've been staples of science fiction for 50 years.
[01:53:43.740 --> 01:53:45.780]   I mean, the whole field of cryogenics.
[01:53:45.780 --> 01:53:47.020]   Yeah, where are we at with that?
[01:53:47.020 --> 01:53:48.700]   Yeah, I wonder what the state of the art is
[01:53:48.700 --> 01:53:50.220]   for a complex organism.
[01:53:50.220 --> 01:53:51.260]   How long?
[01:53:51.260 --> 01:53:53.300]   How long can you freeze and then unfreeze?
[01:53:53.300 --> 01:53:54.140]   Right.
[01:53:54.140 --> 01:53:56.140]   Maybe like with bacteria, you could do freeze and unfreeze.
[01:53:56.140 --> 01:53:57.140]   Oh, bacteria can last.
[01:53:57.140 --> 01:53:59.140]   This is the thing about panspermia, right?
[01:53:59.140 --> 01:54:02.160]   How long can, you know,
[01:54:02.160 --> 01:54:04.800]   how long can a bacteria survive in a rock
[01:54:04.800 --> 01:54:05.640]   that's been blasted?
[01:54:05.640 --> 01:54:07.080]   You know, if there's a comet impact
[01:54:07.080 --> 01:54:09.760]   across, you know, interstellar distances.
[01:54:09.760 --> 01:54:11.520]   That does seem to actually be possible.
[01:54:11.520 --> 01:54:13.200]   People have done those kinds of calculations.
[01:54:13.200 --> 01:54:14.840]   It's not out of the realm of possibility,
[01:54:14.840 --> 01:54:17.520]   but a complex organism, multicellular,
[01:54:17.520 --> 01:54:19.980]   multisystemic or multisystems, right,
[01:54:19.980 --> 01:54:20.920]   with organs and such.
[01:54:20.920 --> 01:54:22.800]   - Also, what makes an organism?
[01:54:22.800 --> 01:54:24.240]   I mean, it could, you know,
[01:54:24.240 --> 01:54:25.840]   which part do you want to preserve?
[01:54:25.840 --> 01:54:27.280]   Because maybe the, for humans,
[01:54:27.280 --> 01:54:31.900]   it seems like, like what makes a personality?
[01:54:31.900 --> 01:54:35.640]   It feels like you want to preserve a set of memories.
[01:54:35.640 --> 01:54:38.820]   Like if I woke up in a different body
[01:54:38.820 --> 01:54:41.400]   with the same memories, I'd pretty much,
[01:54:41.400 --> 01:54:43.160]   I would feel like I would be the same person.
[01:54:43.160 --> 01:54:44.240]   - Altered carbon?
[01:54:44.240 --> 01:54:45.840]   Have you, that's a great series.
[01:54:45.840 --> 01:54:46.920]   I think it's on Netflix.
[01:54:46.920 --> 01:54:49.000]   It's, you know, that's a really great series
[01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:50.400]   where that's exactly the idea of sleeves.
[01:54:50.400 --> 01:54:51.760]   Everybody's able to like, you know,
[01:54:51.760 --> 01:54:54.080]   you can re-sleeve in another body.
[01:54:54.080 --> 01:54:56.480]   And it raises exactly sort of this question.
[01:54:56.480 --> 01:54:57.880]   It's not the greatest cyberpunk,
[01:54:57.880 --> 01:54:58.720]   but it's pretty good.
[01:54:58.720 --> 01:55:01.540]   It's got some great action sequences too.
[01:55:01.540 --> 01:55:03.420]   - As we get better and better advancements
[01:55:03.420 --> 01:55:05.560]   in large language models
[01:55:05.560 --> 01:55:09.440]   that are able to be fine-tuned on you,
[01:55:09.440 --> 01:55:11.840]   it raises a question,
[01:55:11.840 --> 01:55:14.300]   because to me, they've already passed the Turing test,
[01:55:14.300 --> 01:55:16.920]   as we traditionally have defined it.
[01:55:16.920 --> 01:55:18.360]   So if there's going to be an LLM
[01:55:18.360 --> 01:55:19.720]   that's able to copy you
[01:55:19.720 --> 01:55:22.440]   in terms of language extremely well,
[01:55:22.440 --> 01:55:24.960]   it's gonna raise ethical and, I don't know,
[01:55:24.960 --> 01:55:28.240]   philosophical questions about what makes you, you.
[01:55:28.240 --> 01:55:30.240]   Like what, if there's a thing
[01:55:30.240 --> 01:55:32.640]   that can talk exactly like you,
[01:55:32.640 --> 01:55:35.300]   like what is the thing that makes you, you?
[01:55:35.300 --> 01:55:39.960]   Is it, it's gonna speak about your memories
[01:55:39.960 --> 01:55:41.260]   very effectively.
[01:55:41.260 --> 01:55:42.100]   - This leads us to,
[01:55:42.100 --> 01:55:43.920]   if we're gonna get to the blind spot.
[01:55:43.920 --> 01:55:46.100]   I, you know, I am of the opinion,
[01:55:46.100 --> 01:55:48.000]   heretical in some camps,
[01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:51.560]   that, you know, the brain is not the minimal,
[01:55:51.560 --> 01:55:53.800]   the minimal structure for consciousness.
[01:55:53.800 --> 01:55:55.680]   You know, it's the whole body.
[01:55:55.680 --> 01:55:57.240]   It's embodied and made, actually, in some sense,
[01:55:57.240 --> 01:55:59.500]   it's communities, actually.
[01:55:59.500 --> 01:56:02.040]   So yeah, so I don't, I mean, you know, I could be wrong,
[01:56:02.040 --> 01:56:03.760]   but this is, you know, this is what this whole work
[01:56:03.760 --> 01:56:05.840]   that I did with Marcello Gleiser and Evan Thompson,
[01:56:05.840 --> 01:56:08.060]   the philosophy of science,
[01:56:08.060 --> 01:56:09.480]   which is interesting 'cause it leads to this question
[01:56:09.480 --> 01:56:10.800]   about, you know, right,
[01:56:10.800 --> 01:56:12.040]   oh, maybe we should just download ourselves
[01:56:12.040 --> 01:56:12.880]   into computers, right?
[01:56:12.880 --> 01:56:15.360]   That's another story that one tells.
[01:56:15.360 --> 01:56:17.440]   I'm super skeptical about those,
[01:56:17.440 --> 01:56:18.800]   but it is, that's one of the narratives
[01:56:18.800 --> 01:56:20.840]   about interstellar travel is just like,
[01:56:20.840 --> 01:56:23.680]   and that anybody we meet is gonna be a machine anyway,
[01:56:23.680 --> 01:56:25.600]   whether it's like, whether it's downloaded bodies
[01:56:25.600 --> 01:56:27.280]   or it's just gonna be artificial intelligence.
[01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:28.120]   Like, there's the whole idea
[01:56:28.120 --> 01:56:30.880]   of how long does biological evolution last?
[01:56:30.880 --> 01:56:32.560]   Maybe it's a very short period
[01:56:32.560 --> 01:56:34.280]   before everybody, you know, goes to,
[01:56:34.280 --> 01:56:36.760]   or the machines take over and, you know, kill ya,
[01:56:36.760 --> 01:56:39.440]   or, you know, it's some hybrid.
[01:56:39.440 --> 01:56:41.560]   - What do you think aliens look like?
[01:56:41.560 --> 01:56:43.400]   So we talked about all the different kinds
[01:56:43.400 --> 01:56:46.200]   of biosignatures that might leave or technosignatures,
[01:56:46.200 --> 01:56:49.400]   but what would they look like when we show up?
[01:56:49.400 --> 01:56:52.560]   Are they gonna have arms and legs?
[01:56:52.560 --> 01:56:55.720]   Are they going to be recognizable at all?
[01:56:55.720 --> 01:56:57.040]   Are they gonna be carbon-based?
[01:56:57.040 --> 01:56:58.960]   - Yeah, so, great question.
[01:56:58.960 --> 01:57:00.360]   And this question gets to the heart
[01:57:00.360 --> 01:57:05.000]   of thinking about life, right, about what life is.
[01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:06.800]   And this is the physical part of that.
[01:57:06.800 --> 01:57:10.560]   There's also sort of the informational part of it,
[01:57:10.560 --> 01:57:13.080]   but let's just talk about the physical part of it,
[01:57:13.080 --> 01:57:15.000]   which is, you know, life,
[01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:16.360]   anything that we're gonna call life
[01:57:16.360 --> 01:57:18.600]   is probably gonna work on Darwinian evolution.
[01:57:18.600 --> 01:57:20.280]   That's the nice thing about Darwinian evolution.
[01:57:20.280 --> 01:57:22.480]   Just like we know the laws of physics are general,
[01:57:22.480 --> 01:57:24.920]   the laws of Darwinian evolution are kind of this logic,
[01:57:24.920 --> 01:57:27.600]   this basic logic, that, you know,
[01:57:27.600 --> 01:57:29.400]   anything we'd reasonably call life
[01:57:29.400 --> 01:57:32.560]   probably has to operate under these kinds of principles.
[01:57:32.560 --> 01:57:35.660]   And so, you know, evolution's about solving problems
[01:57:35.660 --> 01:57:40.660]   that, you know, to survive that the environment presents.
[01:57:40.660 --> 01:57:43.560]   And the environment's always gonna present these problems
[01:57:43.560 --> 01:57:45.700]   in physical and chemical terms,
[01:57:45.700 --> 01:57:49.800]   so that you'd expect a kind of balance
[01:57:49.800 --> 01:57:51.280]   between what we call convergence,
[01:57:51.280 --> 01:57:55.040]   evolutionary convergence, and evolutionary contingency.
[01:57:55.040 --> 01:57:57.720]   So, you know, if you've gotta move along a surface,
[01:57:57.720 --> 01:58:01.160]   you know, a surface between a hard surface and air,
[01:58:01.160 --> 01:58:05.240]   then the idea of some kind of jointed stick, right, legs,
[01:58:05.240 --> 01:58:07.280]   makes sense, that you're probably gonna trigger that.
[01:58:07.280 --> 01:58:09.240]   You know, if we look at Earth's history, multiple times,
[01:58:09.240 --> 01:58:11.640]   multiple lineages that had nothing to do with each other
[01:58:11.640 --> 01:58:13.520]   are going to solve the problem
[01:58:13.520 --> 01:58:15.580]   of getting towards energy sources
[01:58:15.580 --> 01:58:18.560]   using some kind of, you know, stick-like apparatus.
[01:58:18.560 --> 01:58:19.980]   - So that's about movement?
[01:58:19.980 --> 01:58:21.360]   - Yeah, so that's one problem that has to be solved.
[01:58:21.360 --> 01:58:22.200]   One problem that has to be solved
[01:58:22.200 --> 01:58:23.840]   is I gotta get to food, right?
[01:58:23.840 --> 01:58:26.320]   Another problem is I gotta get away from predators, right?
[01:58:26.320 --> 01:58:27.160]   You've seen wings.
[01:58:27.160 --> 01:58:30.200]   We've seen wings, the line that went through dinosaurs
[01:58:30.200 --> 01:58:32.200]   to birds involved wings.
[01:58:32.200 --> 01:58:34.040]   Insects evolved wings.
[01:58:34.040 --> 01:58:35.680]   Mammals evolved wings.
[01:58:35.680 --> 01:58:38.200]   If the gas is dense enough that a curved surface,
[01:58:38.200 --> 01:58:39.400]   if you move through the curved surface,
[01:58:39.400 --> 01:58:40.680]   it's gonna produce lift.
[01:58:40.680 --> 01:58:42.720]   Yeah, there you go, evolutional trip on that.
[01:58:42.720 --> 01:58:47.400]   So I think you can expect certain classes of solutions
[01:58:47.400 --> 01:58:52.060]   to the basic problems that life is gonna be presented with.
[01:58:52.060 --> 01:58:54.100]   Stay alive, reproduce.
[01:58:54.100 --> 01:58:58.220]   But one of the weird things about like with the UFO things
[01:58:58.220 --> 01:59:00.420]   is that you always see like, oh, they all look like humans.
[01:59:00.420 --> 01:59:02.100]   They're just like basically humans with, you know,
[01:59:02.100 --> 01:59:03.300]   triangular heads.
[01:59:03.300 --> 01:59:06.220]   And that's where we get to contingency, right?
[01:59:06.220 --> 01:59:07.580]   So what we've been talking about is convergence.
[01:59:07.580 --> 01:59:10.800]   You expect that evolution will converge on wings
[01:59:10.800 --> 01:59:13.540]   multiple times when presented with the problems
[01:59:13.540 --> 01:59:14.700]   that wings can solve.
[01:59:15.780 --> 01:59:19.520]   But contingency is accidents, right?
[01:59:19.520 --> 01:59:20.720]   That, you know, you've got something
[01:59:20.720 --> 01:59:22.360]   that's evolving a certain kind of wing,
[01:59:22.360 --> 01:59:23.920]   a leathery wing, right?
[01:59:23.920 --> 01:59:25.800]   And then, you know, the climate changes
[01:59:25.800 --> 01:59:27.640]   and they all die out, end of story.
[01:59:27.640 --> 01:59:29.240]   Or, you know, an asteroid, a total accident,
[01:59:29.240 --> 01:59:30.380]   an asteroid hits.
[01:59:30.380 --> 01:59:34.400]   And so contingency, accidents play also a huge role
[01:59:34.400 --> 01:59:35.280]   in evolution.
[01:59:35.280 --> 01:59:37.360]   And one of the things that, you know,
[01:59:37.360 --> 01:59:39.640]   lots of evolutionary biologists have talked about
[01:59:39.640 --> 01:59:41.960]   is the idea that if you ran the tape of Earth's history
[01:59:41.960 --> 01:59:44.760]   over again, would you get the same creatures?
[01:59:44.760 --> 01:59:48.260]   Now, Stephen Jay Gould was of the opinion that no way,
[01:59:48.260 --> 01:59:50.140]   that you wouldn't find anything on Earth
[01:59:50.140 --> 01:59:52.940]   that resembled any species today.
[01:59:52.940 --> 01:59:55.940]   They've done experiments actually on this with E. coli.
[01:59:55.940 --> 01:59:57.620]   You know, you take a bunch of E. coli,
[01:59:57.620 --> 01:59:58.940]   you let them evolve for a while,
[01:59:58.940 --> 02:00:00.660]   you take a bunch of them out, freeze them,
[02:00:00.660 --> 02:00:03.820]   let one, you know, let that population continue to evolve,
[02:00:03.820 --> 02:00:04.820]   the other one's frozen,
[02:00:04.820 --> 02:00:07.580]   now start it over again with the frozen.
[02:00:07.580 --> 02:00:10.700]   And it seems to me that contingency tends to win, right?
[02:00:10.700 --> 02:00:13.180]   The contingency, at least from what we can tell,
[02:00:13.180 --> 02:00:14.680]   I mean, that's not a hard result,
[02:00:14.680 --> 02:00:16.080]   but in those experiments,
[02:00:16.080 --> 02:00:18.140]   what you find is that accidents really do matter.
[02:00:18.140 --> 02:00:19.660]   So the idea, and this is important,
[02:00:19.660 --> 02:00:23.520]   so yes, you should expect legs or jointed sticks.
[02:00:23.520 --> 02:00:25.220]   How many joints they're gonna be?
[02:00:25.220 --> 02:00:26.140]   Anybody's guess.
[02:00:26.140 --> 02:00:29.060]   You know, do you expect humanoids, you know,
[02:00:29.060 --> 02:00:31.420]   things with a, you know, a sensing apparatus
[02:00:31.420 --> 02:00:34.340]   on top of a shoulder with two arms and two legs?
[02:00:34.340 --> 02:00:37.860]   That's probably a pretty random set of occurrences
[02:00:37.860 --> 02:00:39.180]   that led to that.
[02:00:39.180 --> 02:00:43.420]   - I guess what is a brain versus the nervous system,
[02:00:43.420 --> 02:00:46.200]   like where is most of the cognition competition going on?
[02:00:46.200 --> 02:00:47.840]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:00:47.840 --> 02:00:49.400]   - You could see that in organisms.
[02:00:49.400 --> 02:00:54.240]   Like, actually, I don't know how the brain evolved.
[02:00:54.240 --> 02:00:56.120]   Like, why does it have to be in one place?
[02:00:56.120 --> 02:00:56.960]   - Doesn't have to be.
[02:00:56.960 --> 02:01:00.080]   So my favorite word, word of the day, is liquid brains,
[02:01:00.080 --> 02:01:02.400]   right, this idea of distributed cognition,
[02:01:02.400 --> 02:01:04.200]   which, fascinating idea.
[02:01:04.200 --> 02:01:05.160]   And we've come to understand
[02:01:05.160 --> 02:01:09.200]   how much distributed cognition there is.
[02:01:09.200 --> 02:01:12.960]   Obviously, you social animals, like termites, et cetera,
[02:01:12.960 --> 02:01:15.400]   and ants, that's an example of distributed cognition.
[02:01:15.400 --> 02:01:17.720]   The organism is the whole colony.
[02:01:17.720 --> 02:01:19.040]   This is one thing that's been really interesting
[02:01:19.040 --> 02:01:21.600]   in the state of the study when we cut to, for aliens,
[02:01:21.600 --> 02:01:22.760]   is that when we've come to recognize
[02:01:22.760 --> 02:01:25.120]   that human intelligence, it's not actually,
[02:01:25.120 --> 02:01:26.560]   it's been distributed, the kinds of things
[02:01:26.560 --> 02:01:28.520]   that go into intelligence are distributed
[02:01:28.520 --> 02:01:30.400]   all across the biosphere.
[02:01:30.400 --> 02:01:32.040]   Lots of different examples of things
[02:01:32.040 --> 02:01:35.320]   show various pieces of what we have.
[02:01:35.320 --> 02:01:38.040]   Jason Wright will describe it as like a deck of cards.
[02:01:38.040 --> 02:01:39.120]   The cards are all there.
[02:01:39.120 --> 02:01:40.440]   We got the hand that actually led
[02:01:40.440 --> 02:01:41.960]   to the kind of technological progress
[02:01:41.960 --> 02:01:43.520]   that we see.
[02:01:43.520 --> 02:01:46.240]   But the kinds of, the basic idea of using tools,
[02:01:46.240 --> 02:01:48.560]   the basic idea of recognizing each other eye to eye,
[02:01:48.560 --> 02:01:50.800]   all the things that we define as intelligence,
[02:01:50.800 --> 02:01:55.080]   you can find many places and many other places across,
[02:01:55.080 --> 02:01:57.640]   many other lineages across the Earth.
[02:01:57.640 --> 02:02:00.060]   So it could be, they could be very, very different
[02:02:00.060 --> 02:02:03.040]   with something like, yeah, maybe it's the hive mind idea
[02:02:03.040 --> 02:02:06.720]   or bacterial colonies that actually manage
[02:02:06.720 --> 02:02:10.600]   to come to their own version of high cognition.
[02:02:10.600 --> 02:02:13.360]   - But I wonder if there's, if we stretch out time
[02:02:13.360 --> 02:02:17.600]   across 10, 20 billion years,
[02:02:17.600 --> 02:02:20.440]   whether there's a Darwinian evolution
[02:02:20.440 --> 02:02:23.880]   stops working at some point in terms of the biology
[02:02:23.880 --> 02:02:25.400]   or the chemistry of the organisms
[02:02:25.400 --> 02:02:28.440]   and it switches to ideas, for example.
[02:02:28.440 --> 02:02:31.540]   It's much more rapidly, you're operating maybe,
[02:02:31.540 --> 02:02:33.500]   I guess it's a kind of Darwinian evolution
[02:02:33.500 --> 02:02:35.800]   on the space of memes or whatever it is.
[02:02:35.800 --> 02:02:37.600]   - Technology seems to operate on,
[02:02:37.600 --> 02:02:41.320]   and certainly markets can operate
[02:02:41.320 --> 02:02:43.080]   in ways that look very Darwinian.
[02:02:43.080 --> 02:02:46.120]   - So basically a planet is working hard
[02:02:46.120 --> 02:02:48.320]   to get to the first kind of organisms
[02:02:48.320 --> 02:02:53.320]   that's able to be a nice platform for ideas to compete.
[02:02:53.320 --> 02:02:55.880]   And then it kind of stops evolving there.
[02:02:55.880 --> 02:02:57.680]   And then it's ideas that take off.
[02:02:57.680 --> 02:02:59.400]   - Right, right, 'cause yeah, cultural, it's true.
[02:02:59.400 --> 02:03:01.640]   It's amazing that cultural evolution
[02:03:01.640 --> 02:03:05.780]   totally disconnects from the Darwinian process.
[02:03:05.780 --> 02:03:07.400]   But I'd be careful to say that a planet
[02:03:07.400 --> 02:03:08.440]   is working hard to do this.
[02:03:08.440 --> 02:03:10.720]   'Cause it's really, looking at us,
[02:03:10.720 --> 02:03:13.400]   what we think of as ideas and culture,
[02:03:13.400 --> 02:03:15.880]   and it's quite possible we're gonna make it
[02:03:15.880 --> 02:03:18.040]   another 200 years and this is gone, right?
[02:03:18.040 --> 02:03:20.880]   'Cause it actually wasn't a very good idea long-term.
[02:03:20.880 --> 02:03:22.080]   I mean, we just don't know.
[02:03:22.080 --> 02:03:24.800]   - So maybe the idea generation organism
[02:03:24.800 --> 02:03:26.640]   is actually the thing that destroys.
[02:03:26.640 --> 02:03:27.760]   - Not the biosphere, 'cause again,
[02:03:27.760 --> 02:03:28.800]   but it destroys itself.
[02:03:28.800 --> 02:03:30.240]   It may not be very long-term.
[02:03:30.240 --> 02:03:33.160]   It may be very potent for a short period of time,
[02:03:33.160 --> 02:03:34.840]   but that it's not sustainable.
[02:03:34.840 --> 02:03:36.320]   It doesn't become, like we were talking about before,
[02:03:36.320 --> 02:03:38.360]   mature, it's very hard to make it into,
[02:03:38.360 --> 02:03:42.720]   integrate it into a mature bio/technosphere.
[02:03:42.720 --> 02:03:45.280]   And of course, evolution is not working for anything.
[02:03:45.280 --> 02:03:46.600]   Well, here's the actually interesting thing, right?
[02:03:46.600 --> 02:03:49.080]   So people are very much, evolutionary biologists
[02:03:49.080 --> 02:03:50.800]   will get very, their hair will stand on end
[02:03:50.800 --> 02:03:51.880]   if you start talking about evolution
[02:03:51.880 --> 02:03:53.360]   having a purpose or anything.
[02:03:53.360 --> 02:03:55.680]   But the very interesting thing about purpose
[02:03:55.680 --> 02:03:59.000]   is that once you do get to a idea-generating species
[02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:04.000]   or collective organism, yeah, then kind of all bets are off
[02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:08.720]   and there is goals, there is teleology,
[02:04:08.720 --> 02:04:11.800]   there is a, now suddenly, absolutely,
[02:04:11.800 --> 02:04:13.240]   there's a direction implied.
[02:04:13.240 --> 02:04:15.040]   So that's kind of the cool, interesting thing
[02:04:15.040 --> 02:04:19.160]   that once you get to that, evolution stops being goalless
[02:04:19.160 --> 02:04:20.920]   and directionless, and suddenly, yeah,
[02:04:20.920 --> 02:04:23.340]   we're the ones who supply, or any kind of creature like us
[02:04:23.340 --> 02:04:25.800]   has an absolute direction, that way they decide on.
[02:04:25.800 --> 02:04:27.560]   - Although you could argue that from a perspective
[02:04:27.560 --> 02:04:30.040]   of the entire of human civilization,
[02:04:30.040 --> 02:04:31.600]   we're also directionless.
[02:04:31.600 --> 02:04:34.560]   We have a sense that there's a direction
[02:04:34.560 --> 02:04:39.000]   in this cluster of humans, and then there's another cluster
[02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:40.480]   that has a different sense of direction,
[02:04:40.480 --> 02:04:42.900]   there's all kinds of religions that are competing,
[02:04:42.900 --> 02:04:45.480]   there's different ideologies that are competing.
[02:04:45.480 --> 02:04:49.800]   And when you just zoom out across, if we survive,
[02:04:49.800 --> 02:04:52.240]   across thousands of years, it will seem directionless,
[02:04:52.240 --> 02:04:54.120]   it will seem like a pinball-- - It's a mess.
[02:04:54.120 --> 02:04:55.120]   (laughing)
[02:04:55.120 --> 02:04:56.760]   It's an unholy mess.
[02:04:56.760 --> 02:05:00.280]   But at some point, the expansion into the solar system,
[02:05:00.280 --> 02:05:03.120]   say, that would be both direction,
[02:05:03.120 --> 02:05:04.840]   I mean, depending on how you look at it,
[02:05:04.840 --> 02:05:07.400]   it was directional, there was a decision
[02:05:07.400 --> 02:05:09.520]   that the collective of human beings made
[02:05:09.520 --> 02:05:12.360]   to anti-accrete, to start spreading out
[02:05:12.360 --> 02:05:13.260]   into the solar system.
[02:05:13.260 --> 02:05:15.640]   So there was definitely a goal there
[02:05:15.640 --> 02:05:17.800]   that may have been reached in some crazy,
[02:05:17.800 --> 02:05:21.680]   sort of non-linear way, but it was still, right,
[02:05:21.680 --> 02:05:23.600]   there was still, it's still a goal was set
[02:05:23.600 --> 02:05:25.120]   and it was achieved.
[02:05:25.120 --> 02:05:27.400]   - If there's advanced civilizations out there,
[02:05:27.400 --> 02:05:31.540]   what do you think is the proper protocol
[02:05:31.540 --> 02:05:32.880]   for interacting with them?
[02:05:32.880 --> 02:05:34.640]   Do you think they would be peaceful?
[02:05:34.640 --> 02:05:36.400]   Do you think they would be warlike?
[02:05:36.400 --> 02:05:38.920]   Like, what do we do next?
[02:05:38.920 --> 02:05:41.040]   We detect the civilizations,
[02:05:41.040 --> 02:05:43.680]   do all the technosignatures we've been talking about,
[02:05:43.680 --> 02:05:46.720]   maybe direct imaging, maybe there's really strong signal,
[02:05:46.720 --> 02:05:49.960]   we come up with a strategy of how to actually get there,
[02:05:49.960 --> 02:05:53.180]   but what's the, then the general says they always do,
[02:05:54.080 --> 02:05:56.000]   the military, industrial complex.
[02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:57.480]   - We've watched that movie.
[02:05:57.480 --> 02:06:01.080]   - Where, what kind of rockets, what kind of,
[02:06:01.080 --> 02:06:02.440]   and do we bring rockets?
[02:06:02.440 --> 02:06:03.800]   - Right.
[02:06:03.800 --> 02:06:05.640]   Well, I think, you know, so this also,
[02:06:05.640 --> 02:06:07.520]   this general question also leads to METI,
[02:06:07.520 --> 02:06:09.760]   Messaging Extraterrestrial Intelligence.
[02:06:09.760 --> 02:06:11.280]   And I am definitely of the opinion of like,
[02:06:11.280 --> 02:06:13.660]   you should be very careful, you know?
[02:06:13.660 --> 02:06:15.520]   Like, I don't think it's necessarily a bad idea
[02:06:15.520 --> 02:06:17.420]   to have your head below the grass.
[02:06:17.420 --> 02:06:20.160]   You know, the people who advocate like, oh yeah,
[02:06:20.160 --> 02:06:22.660]   we should be sending, you know, powerful messages
[02:06:22.660 --> 02:06:25.920]   that are easily detectable into interstellar space.
[02:06:25.920 --> 02:06:27.920]   I'm like, why would you, 'cause we just don't know.
[02:06:27.920 --> 02:06:29.760]   Like, I'm not gonna say they are war-like.
[02:06:29.760 --> 02:06:30.880]   I'm not gonna say they're not war-like.
[02:06:30.880 --> 02:06:34.400]   I have no idea, you know, but we sure as hell,
[02:06:34.400 --> 02:06:36.280]   well, first of all, who gets to decide that?
[02:06:36.280 --> 02:06:37.520]   The idea that a bunch of astronomers
[02:06:37.520 --> 02:06:39.960]   who happen to have a radio telescope, I don't, you know,
[02:06:39.960 --> 02:06:42.920]   who speaks for earth, which I think was a great book
[02:06:42.920 --> 02:06:44.360]   somebody wrote.
[02:06:44.360 --> 02:06:48.500]   So, you know, I definitely, we should be cautious,
[02:06:48.500 --> 02:06:50.880]   I would say, 'cause we just have zero information.
[02:06:50.880 --> 02:06:52.440]   And the idea, you used to have this idea of,
[02:06:52.440 --> 02:06:54.340]   well, if they're advanced, they've managed to survive.
[02:06:54.340 --> 02:06:56.660]   So of course they're gonna be wearing togas, you know,
[02:06:56.660 --> 02:06:58.580]   and be singing Kumbaya.
[02:06:58.580 --> 02:07:00.740]   But I just wouldn't assume that.
[02:07:00.740 --> 02:07:01.660]   It's also possible, though,
[02:07:01.660 --> 02:07:04.700]   that like their cognitive structure is so different
[02:07:04.700 --> 02:07:06.940]   that we're not even living in the same universe
[02:07:06.940 --> 02:07:07.780]   in a certain way.
[02:07:07.780 --> 02:07:09.100]   I think we have to be prepared for that.
[02:07:09.100 --> 02:07:11.340]   We may not even be able to recognize each other
[02:07:11.340 --> 02:07:15.420]   in some way as cognizing beings.
[02:07:15.420 --> 02:07:17.500]   One of my favorite movies is "Arrival."
[02:07:17.500 --> 02:07:18.500]   I don't know if you've ever seen that one.
[02:07:18.500 --> 02:07:19.540]   I really love that one because, you know,
[02:07:19.540 --> 02:07:21.140]   they literally, they have a different language,
[02:07:21.140 --> 02:07:22.740]   they have a different cognitive structure
[02:07:22.740 --> 02:07:23.580]   in terms of their language,
[02:07:23.580 --> 02:07:25.780]   and they're literally kind of living in a different physics.
[02:07:25.780 --> 02:07:27.540]   - Different physics, different language,
[02:07:27.540 --> 02:07:29.980]   different everything.
[02:07:29.980 --> 02:07:30.820]   - Yeah.
[02:07:30.820 --> 02:07:31.660]   - But in the case of "Arrival,"
[02:07:31.660 --> 02:07:34.300]   it can at least like recognize that they're there.
[02:07:34.300 --> 02:07:35.140]   - They did, right.
[02:07:35.140 --> 02:07:38.700]   And they managed to cross the language barrier, yeah.
[02:07:38.700 --> 02:07:41.340]   - So, but that's, both sides have an interest
[02:07:41.340 --> 02:07:43.940]   in communicating, which you kind of suppose
[02:07:43.940 --> 02:07:47.900]   that an advanced civilization would have a curiosity.
[02:07:48.920 --> 02:07:50.340]   Because like, how do you become advanced
[02:07:50.340 --> 02:07:53.540]   without a kind of curiosity about the mysterious,
[02:07:53.540 --> 02:07:54.780]   about the other?
[02:07:54.780 --> 02:07:57.020]   - But also, you know, if they're long-lived,
[02:07:57.020 --> 02:07:59.380]   they may just be like, we're not even interested.
[02:07:59.380 --> 02:08:02.380]   Like, we've done this, we're like, you know,
[02:08:02.380 --> 02:08:05.460]   10 billion years, or sorry, say 10 million years ago,
[02:08:05.460 --> 02:08:07.180]   we were really interested in that, in this,
[02:08:07.180 --> 02:08:09.540]   in communicating with you, you know, youngins,
[02:08:09.540 --> 02:08:10.700]   but now we're not at all.
[02:08:10.700 --> 02:08:13.000]   And that's just, you know, one of the beauties of this,
[02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.220]   again, is how to think about this systematically,
[02:08:15.220 --> 02:08:18.380]   'cause you're so far past the hairy edge, right,
[02:08:18.380 --> 02:08:21.120]   of our experience, of what we know,
[02:08:21.120 --> 02:08:22.640]   that you want to think about it, right?
[02:08:22.640 --> 02:08:24.600]   You don't wanna be like, don't know, can't say anything,
[02:08:24.600 --> 02:08:25.680]   'cause that's not fun.
[02:08:25.680 --> 02:08:27.780]   But you also have to sort of systematically
[02:08:27.780 --> 02:08:30.440]   go after your own biases, right?
[02:08:30.440 --> 02:08:32.240]   So one of the things I loved about Arrival too,
[02:08:32.240 --> 02:08:34.080]   was, you know, Carl Sagan always had this idea,
[02:08:34.080 --> 02:08:36.520]   like, we'll teach 'em math, we'll teach 'em our math,
[02:08:36.520 --> 02:08:38.000]   then they'll teach us their math,
[02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:39.720]   and then, you know, we'll be telling each other
[02:08:39.720 --> 02:08:42.840]   knock-knock jokes, you know, and swapping cures for cancer.
[02:08:42.840 --> 02:08:44.000]   And, you know, in the movie, like,
[02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.040]   they send a Carl Sagan guy in and a linguist,
[02:08:46.040 --> 02:08:48.740]   and the Carl Sagan guy fails immediately, right?
[02:08:48.740 --> 02:08:50.020]   And it's the linguist who understands
[02:08:50.020 --> 02:08:51.580]   that language is actually embodied.
[02:08:51.580 --> 02:08:53.540]   Language is not just something that happens in your head,
[02:08:53.540 --> 02:08:55.620]   it's actually the whole experience.
[02:08:55.620 --> 02:08:57.260]   And she's the one who breaks through.
[02:08:57.260 --> 02:08:59.140]   And it just points to the idea that,
[02:08:59.140 --> 02:09:03.100]   how utterly different the cognitive structures,
[02:09:03.100 --> 02:09:05.680]   the, you know, of a different species should be.
[02:09:05.680 --> 02:09:08.400]   So somehow we have to figure out how to think about it,
[02:09:08.400 --> 02:09:10.320]   but be so careful of our biases,
[02:09:10.320 --> 02:09:11.820]   or figure out, like, a systematic way
[02:09:11.820 --> 02:09:13.860]   to break through our biases,
[02:09:13.860 --> 02:09:15.860]   and not just tell, make science fiction movies,
[02:09:15.860 --> 02:09:16.880]   you know what I mean?
[02:09:16.880 --> 02:09:19.080]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:09:19.080 --> 02:09:20.540]   Speaking of biases,
[02:09:20.540 --> 02:09:22.740]   do you think aliens have visited Earth?
[02:09:22.740 --> 02:09:24.620]   You've mentioned that they could have visited
[02:09:24.620 --> 02:09:25.940]   and started civilizations,
[02:09:25.940 --> 02:09:27.700]   and we wouldn't even know about it
[02:09:27.700 --> 02:09:30.740]   if it was 100 million years ago.
[02:09:30.740 --> 02:09:32.380]   How could we even begin to answer this question?
[02:09:32.380 --> 02:09:34.900]   - Gotta look, gotta look, gotta figure out ways to look.
[02:09:34.900 --> 02:09:36.660]   So I, you know, I mean, I don't put it,
[02:09:36.660 --> 02:09:38.860]   it's not high on my list of, you know,
[02:09:38.860 --> 02:09:41.120]   things that I think are probable,
[02:09:41.120 --> 02:09:43.980]   but it certainly, it needs to be explored, you know?
[02:09:43.980 --> 02:09:45.260]   And unless you look, you never know.
[02:09:45.260 --> 02:09:48.700]   So looking on the moon, look at where would we find,
[02:09:48.700 --> 02:09:50.860]   if aliens had passed through the solar system
[02:09:50.860 --> 02:09:53.380]   any time in the last three billion years,
[02:09:53.380 --> 02:09:54.700]   where might we find artifacts?
[02:09:54.700 --> 02:09:56.220]   Where might artifacts still be around?
[02:09:56.220 --> 02:10:00.300]   Earth, probably not, 'cause of weathering and resurfacing.
[02:10:00.300 --> 02:10:01.700]   The moon's a good place.
[02:10:01.700 --> 02:10:03.460]   Certain kinds of orbits, you know?
[02:10:03.460 --> 02:10:05.740]   Maybe they parked a probe in an orbit that was stable,
[02:10:05.740 --> 02:10:06.980]   so you gotta figure out which orbits,
[02:10:06.980 --> 02:10:08.060]   actually, you could put something there,
[02:10:08.060 --> 02:10:10.020]   and it'll last for a billion years.
[02:10:10.020 --> 02:10:11.660]   So those are the kind of questions.
[02:10:11.660 --> 02:10:14.240]   I don't, like I said, I don't,
[02:10:14.240 --> 02:10:16.820]   it's not high on my list of thinking this could happen,
[02:10:16.820 --> 02:10:17.720]   but it could happen.
[02:10:17.720 --> 02:10:19.780]   I certainly can't, unless you look, you don't know.
[02:10:19.780 --> 02:10:21.780]   - What about, speaking of biases,
[02:10:21.780 --> 02:10:24.300]   what about if aliens visiting Earth
[02:10:24.300 --> 02:10:26.020]   is the elephant in the room?
[02:10:26.020 --> 02:10:28.400]   Meaning, like, the potential of aliens, say,
[02:10:28.400 --> 02:10:30.420]   seeding life on Earth.
[02:10:30.420 --> 02:10:32.820]   - You mean like in that directed panspermia?
[02:10:32.820 --> 02:10:34.340]   - Directed panspermia. - Yeah.
[02:10:34.340 --> 02:10:39.020]   - Or seeding some aspect of the evolution.
[02:10:39.020 --> 02:10:40.540]   - Like 2001.
[02:10:40.540 --> 02:10:41.380]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[02:10:42.460 --> 02:10:44.500]   You know, it's a great story,
[02:10:44.500 --> 02:10:47.520]   but always with Occam's razor or whatever with science,
[02:10:47.520 --> 02:10:50.960]   if I can answer that question without that extra,
[02:10:50.960 --> 02:10:54.840]   very detailed hypothesis, then I should.
[02:10:54.840 --> 02:10:58.460]   And the idea that evolution is a natural process,
[02:10:58.460 --> 02:11:00.720]   that's what I would go for first, right?
[02:11:00.720 --> 02:11:03.460]   That just seems, it's so much easier to do it that way
[02:11:03.460 --> 02:11:07.640]   than adding, 'cause it's kind of a duos ex machina thing
[02:11:07.640 --> 02:11:09.080]   of like, oh, then the aliens came down
[02:11:09.080 --> 02:11:10.960]   and they solved that problem that you're trying to solve
[02:11:10.960 --> 02:11:13.300]   by just coming down and putting their finger on the scales.
[02:11:13.300 --> 02:11:18.220]   - So to you, the origin of life is a pretty simple thing
[02:11:18.220 --> 02:11:19.660]   that doesn't require an alien.
[02:11:19.660 --> 02:11:21.380]   - I wouldn't say that, it's not a simple thing,
[02:11:21.380 --> 02:11:24.300]   but it doesn't, you know, putting, I think,
[02:11:24.300 --> 02:11:25.300]   'cause you know, all you're doing
[02:11:25.300 --> 02:11:26.860]   is kicking the can down the road, right?
[02:11:26.860 --> 02:11:29.100]   The aliens formed, right?
[02:11:29.100 --> 02:11:30.520]   So you're just saying like, all right,
[02:11:30.520 --> 02:11:33.180]   I'm just kicking the can down the road to the aliens.
[02:11:33.180 --> 02:11:35.700]   How did they, what was their abiogenesis event?
[02:11:35.700 --> 02:11:38.160]   - Well, so from a different perspective, I'm just saying,
[02:11:38.160 --> 02:11:40.060]   it seems to me that there's obviously
[02:11:40.060 --> 02:11:42.460]   advanced civilizations everywhere throughout the galaxy
[02:11:42.460 --> 02:11:43.600]   and through the universe,
[02:11:43.600 --> 02:11:45.580]   from the Drake equation perspective.
[02:11:45.580 --> 02:11:48.340]   And then if I was an alien, what would I do?
[02:11:48.340 --> 02:11:52.000]   You know, I've gotten a chance to learn
[02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:55.700]   about the uncontacted tribes in the Amazon.
[02:11:55.700 --> 02:11:57.100]   I recently went to the Amazon,
[02:11:57.100 --> 02:11:59.100]   you get to understand how they function
[02:11:59.100 --> 02:12:01.500]   and how the humans in the Amazon,
[02:12:01.500 --> 02:12:05.100]   they're in contact with the civilized world,
[02:12:05.100 --> 02:12:07.420]   how they interact with the uncontacted tribes.
[02:12:07.420 --> 02:12:10.180]   First of all, the uncontacted tribes are very violent
[02:12:10.180 --> 02:12:11.760]   towards the outside world,
[02:12:11.760 --> 02:12:13.940]   but everybody else try to stay away from them.
[02:12:13.940 --> 02:12:16.340]   They try to kind of protect them, don't talk about them,
[02:12:16.340 --> 02:12:19.420]   don't talk about their location, all this kind of stuff.
[02:12:19.420 --> 02:12:21.600]   And I've begun to internalize and understand
[02:12:21.600 --> 02:12:23.420]   that perspective of why you're doing that.
[02:12:23.420 --> 02:12:25.840]   And if I was an alien civilization,
[02:12:25.840 --> 02:12:28.740]   I probably would be doing a similar kind of thing.
[02:12:28.740 --> 02:12:30.820]   And of course, there's always the teenager or the troll
[02:12:30.820 --> 02:12:32.860]   who's gonna start messing with this stuff,
[02:12:32.860 --> 02:12:34.580]   or the scientists, you know?
[02:12:34.580 --> 02:12:35.420]   - Yeah, right.
[02:12:35.420 --> 02:12:40.420]   - And so, it's not, from our perspective, yes.
[02:12:40.420 --> 02:12:43.340]   And if you're in the Truman Show, like Occam's Razor.
[02:12:43.340 --> 02:12:45.840]   But like also, the Occam's Razor,
[02:12:45.840 --> 02:12:48.740]   from the perspective of the alien civilization,
[02:12:48.740 --> 02:12:52.740]   we have to have the humility to understand
[02:12:52.740 --> 02:12:56.120]   that that interaction will be extremely difficult to detect.
[02:12:56.120 --> 02:12:57.100]   That it will not be obvious.
[02:12:57.100 --> 02:12:58.900]   - Right, I understand the logic of what you're saying,
[02:12:58.900 --> 02:13:01.300]   but the problem for me with that is that,
[02:13:01.300 --> 02:13:03.180]   right there, first you have to assume
[02:13:03.180 --> 02:13:05.220]   that alien civilizations are common,
[02:13:05.220 --> 02:13:07.460]   which I'm not sure about, most of 'em may be dead,
[02:13:07.460 --> 02:13:10.820]   or they're not, while I think that life is common.
[02:13:10.820 --> 02:13:12.220]   And again, this is just my biases, right?
[02:13:12.220 --> 02:13:14.420]   So now, the problem is, how do we sort out
[02:13:14.420 --> 02:13:18.420]   sort of the biases we're bringing,
[02:13:18.420 --> 02:13:20.420]   or the assumptions we're bringing in,
[02:13:20.420 --> 02:13:25.420]   from the sort of causal chain that comes out of that?
[02:13:25.420 --> 02:13:29.380]   I would first wanna try and do this without,
[02:13:29.380 --> 02:13:31.340]   like if we're talking about the origin of life,
[02:13:31.340 --> 02:13:32.740]   or the evolution of life on Earth.
[02:13:32.740 --> 02:13:34.460]   I'd wanna do it just on its own,
[02:13:34.460 --> 02:13:36.960]   without asking for this other layer.
[02:13:36.960 --> 02:13:41.460]   Because it requires a bunch of these other assumptions,
[02:13:41.460 --> 02:13:44.060]   which also have their own sort of breaking of causal chains.
[02:13:44.060 --> 02:13:46.660]   'Cause I don't really, like the idea that,
[02:13:46.660 --> 02:13:48.960]   when you ask, what would you do if you were an alien?
[02:13:48.960 --> 02:13:50.940]   But again, like alien minds could be
[02:13:50.940 --> 02:13:53.540]   so unbelievably different, right?
[02:13:53.540 --> 02:13:54.740]   That they wouldn't even recognize
[02:13:54.740 --> 02:13:56.780]   the question you just posed, right?
[02:13:56.780 --> 02:13:58.500]   'Cause it's just like, you know, we're very much,
[02:13:58.500 --> 02:14:00.780]   we have a very particular kind of cognitive structure,
[02:14:00.780 --> 02:14:03.780]   or cognitive, you know, and we're very governed by,
[02:14:03.780 --> 02:14:05.220]   even if you went and talked to,
[02:14:05.220 --> 02:14:07.420]   this is an interesting thing to think about,
[02:14:07.420 --> 02:14:09.460]   you know, if I could suddenly magically appear
[02:14:09.460 --> 02:14:10.820]   a hundred thousand years ago,
[02:14:10.820 --> 02:14:12.380]   and talk to a hunter-gatherer,
[02:14:12.380 --> 02:14:14.180]   about their worldview and their motivations,
[02:14:14.180 --> 02:14:15.460]   you know, I might find something that's like,
[02:14:15.460 --> 02:14:18.500]   there were no resemblance to things that I think
[02:14:18.500 --> 02:14:20.460]   are sort of, oh, that's what naturally humans do.
[02:14:20.460 --> 02:14:21.740]   - Well, let me ask you this question.
[02:14:21.740 --> 02:14:23.300]   Let's together do the thought experiment.
[02:14:23.300 --> 02:14:24.140]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:14:24.140 --> 02:14:26.260]   - If we either create a time machine
[02:14:26.260 --> 02:14:28.740]   that allows us to travel back and to talk to them,
[02:14:28.740 --> 02:14:32.100]   or we discover maybe a primitive alien civilization
[02:14:33.380 --> 02:14:37.780]   on a nearby star system, what would we do?
[02:14:37.780 --> 02:14:39.420]   - Yeah, I think that's a great question.
[02:14:39.420 --> 02:14:40.620]   I mean, so, you know, it's interesting how that
[02:14:40.620 --> 02:14:42.460]   even brings up the ethical questions, right?
[02:14:42.460 --> 02:14:44.300]   Let's say that, you know, would we,
[02:14:44.300 --> 02:14:45.980]   we'd have to first sort of sort out
[02:14:45.980 --> 02:14:47.580]   what are the consequences for them,
[02:14:47.580 --> 02:14:51.220]   and what do we feel our ethical responsibilities are to them?
[02:14:51.220 --> 02:14:54.220]   - And also, sorry, from a capitalist perspective,
[02:14:54.220 --> 02:14:56.820]   what are we to gain from this interaction?
[02:14:56.820 --> 02:14:57.660]   - Right, right, right.
[02:14:57.660 --> 02:14:59.020]   You look at the way the missionaries, you know,
[02:14:59.020 --> 02:15:00.500]   missionaries had these interactions
[02:15:00.540 --> 02:15:03.060]   because they thought converting them
[02:15:03.060 --> 02:15:04.740]   to whatever religion they were, you know,
[02:15:04.740 --> 02:15:07.300]   was the most important, that's what the gain was.
[02:15:07.300 --> 02:15:09.380]   So from our perspective, I mean,
[02:15:09.380 --> 02:15:11.420]   we'd have to sort that out.
[02:15:11.420 --> 02:15:12.660]   I think given, you know,
[02:15:12.660 --> 02:15:16.820]   if we're doing this thought experiment, we are curious.
[02:15:16.820 --> 02:15:19.620]   And I think eventually we'd want to reach out to them.
[02:15:19.620 --> 02:15:21.660]   - I think when you say we,
[02:15:21.660 --> 02:15:23.540]   let's start with the people in this room, right?
[02:15:23.540 --> 02:15:24.380]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:15:24.380 --> 02:15:27.540]   - But there is, I wonder who the dominant forces are
[02:15:27.540 --> 02:15:30.380]   in the world, because I think there's a lot of people
[02:15:30.380 --> 02:15:34.260]   in the military, they will probably move first
[02:15:34.260 --> 02:15:37.620]   so they can steal whatever advantage they can
[02:15:37.620 --> 02:15:40.580]   from this new discovery so they can hurt China
[02:15:40.580 --> 02:15:42.700]   or China hurt America.
[02:15:42.700 --> 02:15:44.060]   That's one perspective.
[02:15:44.060 --> 02:15:47.660]   Then there's the capitalists who will see like how
[02:15:47.660 --> 02:15:49.540]   the benefits and the costs here,
[02:15:49.540 --> 02:15:51.420]   and how can I make money off of this?
[02:15:51.420 --> 02:15:55.020]   There's opportunity here, there's gold in them hills.
[02:15:55.020 --> 02:15:56.740]   And I wonder, and I think the scientists
[02:15:56.740 --> 02:15:59.100]   is just not going to, unlike the movies.
[02:15:59.100 --> 02:16:00.660]   We're not going to get much say.
[02:16:00.660 --> 02:16:01.500]   - They're going to put them,
[02:16:01.500 --> 02:16:03.220]   "Hey guys, we, wait a minute."
[02:16:03.220 --> 02:16:04.580]   They would engage probably.
[02:16:04.580 --> 02:16:07.460]   I mean, it's just as a human society as we are now,
[02:16:07.460 --> 02:16:12.300]   we would engage and we would be detectable, I think.
[02:16:12.300 --> 02:16:13.180]   - In our engagement.
[02:16:13.180 --> 02:16:14.020]   - In our engagement.
[02:16:14.020 --> 02:16:15.340]   - Yeah, yeah, probably.
[02:16:15.340 --> 02:16:18.740]   - So using that trivial biased logic,
[02:16:18.740 --> 02:16:21.180]   it just feels like aliens would need to be engaging
[02:16:21.180 --> 02:16:22.620]   in a very obvious way.
[02:16:22.620 --> 02:16:24.460]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:16:25.620 --> 02:16:29.980]   - Which brings up that old direct for me, paradox for me.
[02:16:29.980 --> 02:16:32.980]   What do you make of all the UFO sightings?
[02:16:32.980 --> 02:16:37.740]   - I am all in favor of an open, agnostic,
[02:16:37.740 --> 02:16:42.420]   transparent scientific investigation of UFOs and UAPs.
[02:16:42.420 --> 02:16:46.620]   But the idea that there's any data that we have
[02:16:46.620 --> 02:16:50.420]   that links UFOs and UAPs to non-human technology,
[02:16:50.420 --> 02:16:52.020]   I just think they're the standards.
[02:16:52.020 --> 02:16:55.140]   They just, none of what is claimed to be the data
[02:16:55.140 --> 02:16:56.660]   lives up to the standards of evidence.
[02:16:56.660 --> 02:16:57.500]   So let's just take a moment
[02:16:57.500 --> 02:16:58.900]   on that idea of standards of evidence,
[02:16:58.900 --> 02:17:00.020]   'cause I've made a big deal about this,
[02:17:00.020 --> 02:17:03.020]   both in the book and elsewhere whenever I talk about this.
[02:17:03.020 --> 02:17:04.740]   So what people have to understand about science
[02:17:04.740 --> 02:17:06.980]   is we are really, scientists,
[02:17:06.980 --> 02:17:08.380]   we are really mean to each other.
[02:17:08.380 --> 02:17:10.100]   We are brutal to each other.
[02:17:10.100 --> 02:17:10.980]   'Cause we have this thing
[02:17:10.980 --> 02:17:12.860]   that we call standards of evidence.
[02:17:12.860 --> 02:17:15.820]   And it's the idea of like, you have a piece of evidence
[02:17:15.820 --> 02:17:18.100]   that you wanna link to a claim.
[02:17:18.100 --> 02:17:20.460]   And under what conditions can you say,
[02:17:20.460 --> 02:17:24.660]   "Oh, look, I've got evidence of this claim X, Y, and Z."
[02:17:24.660 --> 02:17:27.860]   And in science, we are so mean to each other
[02:17:27.860 --> 02:17:30.180]   about whether or not that piece of evidence
[02:17:30.180 --> 02:17:32.100]   lives up to the standards that we have.
[02:17:32.100 --> 02:17:33.780]   And we spent 400 years
[02:17:33.780 --> 02:17:36.660]   determining what those standards are.
[02:17:36.660 --> 02:17:39.180]   And that is why cell phones work, right?
[02:17:39.180 --> 02:17:42.180]   If you didn't have super rigorous standards
[02:17:42.180 --> 02:17:43.900]   about what you think that's,
[02:17:43.900 --> 02:17:44.980]   oh, this little antenna,
[02:17:44.980 --> 02:17:46.220]   I've invented a new kind of antenna
[02:17:46.220 --> 02:17:47.940]   that I can slip into the cell phone
[02:17:47.940 --> 02:17:49.980]   and I can show you that it works.
[02:17:49.980 --> 02:17:51.860]   If you didn't have these standards,
[02:17:51.860 --> 02:17:53.780]   every cell phone would be a brick, right?
[02:17:53.780 --> 02:17:55.660]   And when it comes to UFOs and UAPs,
[02:17:55.660 --> 02:17:57.660]   the evidence you have and the claim that though,
[02:17:57.660 --> 02:18:00.700]   this shows that we are being visited
[02:18:00.700 --> 02:18:04.500]   by non-human advanced civilization
[02:18:04.500 --> 02:18:07.220]   just doesn't even come close
[02:18:07.220 --> 02:18:09.820]   to the same standards I'm gonna have to obey
[02:18:09.820 --> 02:18:11.020]   or whatever, live under.
[02:18:11.020 --> 02:18:13.060]   If my team, the group I work with,
[02:18:13.060 --> 02:18:15.340]   if one of them says,
[02:18:15.340 --> 02:18:16.260]   "Look, we've discovered,"
[02:18:16.260 --> 02:18:17.340]   wants to announce that,
[02:18:17.340 --> 02:18:19.460]   "Oh, we've discovered a techno signature
[02:18:19.460 --> 02:18:20.500]   "on an alien planet."
[02:18:20.500 --> 02:18:23.260]   We're gonna get shredded as we expect to be.
[02:18:23.260 --> 02:18:24.980]   We expect to be beaten up.
[02:18:24.980 --> 02:18:28.980]   And the UAP, UFO community should expect the same thing,
[02:18:28.980 --> 02:18:31.260]   that you don't get a pass
[02:18:31.260 --> 02:18:32.820]   because it's a really cool topic.
[02:18:32.820 --> 02:18:33.820]   So that's where I am right now.
[02:18:33.820 --> 02:18:35.940]   I just don't think any of the evidence
[02:18:35.940 --> 02:18:39.420]   is even close to anything that could support that claim.
[02:18:39.420 --> 02:18:42.420]   - Well, I generally assign a lot of value
[02:18:42.420 --> 02:18:44.820]   to anecdotal evidence from pilots.
[02:18:44.820 --> 02:18:45.900]   Not scientific value,
[02:18:45.900 --> 02:18:48.180]   but just like it's always nice
[02:18:48.180 --> 02:18:51.860]   to get anecdotal evidence as a first step.
[02:18:51.860 --> 02:18:53.980]   So it's like, "Hmm, I wonder if there's something there."
[02:18:53.980 --> 02:18:55.580]   But unfortunately with this topic,
[02:18:55.580 --> 02:18:56.860]   there's so much excitement around it.
[02:18:56.860 --> 02:19:00.020]   There's a lot of people that are basically trying
[02:19:00.020 --> 02:19:00.980]   to make money off of it.
[02:19:00.980 --> 02:19:02.380]   There's hoaxes, all this kind of stuff.
[02:19:02.380 --> 02:19:04.740]   So even if there's some signal,
[02:19:04.740 --> 02:19:05.820]   there's just so much noise,
[02:19:05.820 --> 02:19:07.300]   it's very difficult to operate with.
[02:19:07.300 --> 02:19:10.420]   So how do we get better signal?
[02:19:10.420 --> 02:19:12.540]   So you've talked about sort of,
[02:19:12.540 --> 02:19:16.540]   if we wanted to really search for UFOs on Earth
[02:19:16.540 --> 02:19:21.700]   and maybe detect things like weird physics,
[02:19:21.700 --> 02:19:23.820]   what kind of instruments would we be using?
[02:19:23.820 --> 02:19:25.260]   - Yeah, so in the book,
[02:19:25.260 --> 02:19:27.380]   I talked about the idea that this is really stupid,
[02:19:27.380 --> 02:19:30.060]   but you want to look up, you want to look down,
[02:19:30.060 --> 02:19:30.980]   and you want to look all around.
[02:19:30.980 --> 02:19:31.820]   - I think that's brilliant.
[02:19:31.820 --> 02:19:34.700]   I mean, it's simple, not stupid.
[02:19:34.700 --> 02:19:35.700]   It's like literally.
[02:19:35.700 --> 02:19:38.780]   - So you want to do ground-based detectors,
[02:19:38.780 --> 02:19:40.220]   upward-looking ground-based detectors
[02:19:40.220 --> 02:19:42.540]   of the kind we're already building for meteors,
[02:19:42.540 --> 02:19:44.300]   for tracking meteors.
[02:19:44.300 --> 02:19:46.020]   You want to have space-based detectors,
[02:19:46.020 --> 02:19:46.860]   put them on satellites.
[02:19:46.860 --> 02:19:49.340]   This is what the NASA UAP panel was thinking about.
[02:19:49.340 --> 02:19:53.300]   And then probably on, we have lots of people in the sky,
[02:19:53.300 --> 02:19:56.380]   there should be detectors on the planes,
[02:19:56.380 --> 02:19:58.660]   or at least some kind of alert system
[02:19:58.660 --> 02:20:00.500]   that if a pilot says, "Oh, look, I'm seeing something,
[02:20:00.500 --> 02:20:02.660]   "I don't understand," boop, presses the red button,
[02:20:02.660 --> 02:20:04.780]   and that triggers the ground-based
[02:20:04.780 --> 02:20:09.180]   and space-based data collectors.
[02:20:09.180 --> 02:20:10.420]   And then the data collectors themselves,
[02:20:10.420 --> 02:20:12.180]   this is something that people really don't understand,
[02:20:12.180 --> 02:20:13.900]   and it's so important.
[02:20:13.900 --> 02:20:16.260]   In order to actually do science with anything,
[02:20:16.260 --> 02:20:18.620]   the data you have, you have to understand
[02:20:18.620 --> 02:20:22.100]   where it came from, like down to the nth degree.
[02:20:22.100 --> 02:20:26.020]   You have to know how that camera behaves
[02:20:26.020 --> 02:20:27.660]   in a bunch of different wavelengths.
[02:20:27.660 --> 02:20:29.100]   You have to have characterized that.
[02:20:29.100 --> 02:20:31.700]   You have to know what the software does,
[02:20:31.700 --> 02:20:33.340]   what the limits of the software are possibly.
[02:20:33.340 --> 02:20:34.860]   You have to know what happened to the camera.
[02:20:34.860 --> 02:20:37.220]   Was it refurbished recently?
[02:20:37.220 --> 02:20:39.460]   In every spectral wavelength,
[02:20:39.460 --> 02:20:44.100]   in all of its data collection and processing,
[02:20:44.100 --> 02:20:45.260]   you have to know all of those steps
[02:20:45.260 --> 02:20:46.700]   and have them all characterized.
[02:20:46.700 --> 02:20:47.860]   'Cause especially if you wanna claim like,
[02:20:47.860 --> 02:20:49.860]   "Oh my God, I saw something take a right-hand turn
[02:20:49.860 --> 02:20:51.580]   "at Mach 500," right?
[02:20:51.580 --> 02:20:53.940]   You better have all of that nailed down
[02:20:53.940 --> 02:20:55.860]   before you make that kind of claim.
[02:20:55.860 --> 02:20:57.540]   So we have to have characterized detectors
[02:20:57.540 --> 02:21:00.860]   looking up, down, and maybe on planes themselves.
[02:21:00.860 --> 02:21:02.460]   We need a rational search strategy.
[02:21:02.460 --> 02:21:05.940]   So let's say you wanna lay out these ground-based detectors.
[02:21:05.940 --> 02:21:07.060]   Where do you put 'em, right?
[02:21:07.060 --> 02:21:08.660]   There's only so much money in the world.
[02:21:08.660 --> 02:21:10.620]   So do you wanna put 'em near places
[02:21:10.620 --> 02:21:12.220]   where you've seen a lot of things beforehand,
[02:21:12.220 --> 02:21:13.740]   or do you wanna have 'em try and do
[02:21:13.740 --> 02:21:17.220]   a sparse coverage of the entire country?
[02:21:17.220 --> 02:21:20.820]   And then you need the data analysis, right?
[02:21:20.820 --> 02:21:22.340]   You're gonna have so much data,
[02:21:22.340 --> 02:21:25.300]   so many false positives or false triggering,
[02:21:25.300 --> 02:21:26.620]   that you need a way of sorting through
[02:21:26.620 --> 02:21:27.900]   enormous amounts of data
[02:21:27.900 --> 02:21:29.060]   and figuring out what you're gonna throw out
[02:21:29.060 --> 02:21:29.940]   and what you're gonna keep.
[02:21:29.940 --> 02:21:31.460]   And all of these things we're used to doing
[02:21:31.460 --> 02:21:33.140]   in other scientific enterprises.
[02:21:33.140 --> 02:21:35.420]   And without that, if we don't do that,
[02:21:35.420 --> 02:21:37.460]   we're gonna be having the same damn argument
[02:21:37.460 --> 02:21:40.100]   about these things for the next hundred years.
[02:21:40.100 --> 02:21:43.140]   - But if I ask you, I give you a trillion dollars
[02:21:43.140 --> 02:21:47.140]   and ask you to allocate it to one place,
[02:21:47.140 --> 02:21:51.660]   looking out, SETI, or looking at Earth,
[02:21:51.660 --> 02:21:52.500]   what should you allocate it to?
[02:21:52.500 --> 02:21:54.100]   - Oh, God, looking out, looking out.
[02:21:54.100 --> 02:21:55.740]   Because that's the bad, you know, as I always like to say,
[02:21:55.740 --> 02:21:58.100]   here's my codification of this.
[02:21:58.100 --> 02:22:01.420]   If you said, "Hey, Adam, I'd like to find some Nebraskans."
[02:22:01.420 --> 02:22:03.720]   And I said, "Oh, good, let's go to the Himalayas."
[02:22:03.720 --> 02:22:04.560]   (laughs)
[02:22:04.560 --> 02:22:06.020]   You know, you'd be like, "Why am I going there?"
[02:22:06.020 --> 02:22:08.260]   I'm like, "Well, you know, maybe there's some Himalayas,
[02:22:08.260 --> 02:22:09.700]   you know, some Nebraskas in Himalayas."
[02:22:09.700 --> 02:22:11.380]   You say, "No, no, let's go to Nebraska."
[02:22:11.380 --> 02:22:13.380]   If we're looking for aliens,
[02:22:13.380 --> 02:22:16.620]   why don't we look on alien planets where they live?
[02:22:16.620 --> 02:22:18.620]   'Cause that's, we have that technology now,
[02:22:18.620 --> 02:22:22.380]   as opposed to the, you know, the bucket of assumptions
[02:22:22.380 --> 02:22:24.260]   that you have to come up with in order to say like,
[02:22:24.260 --> 02:22:25.580]   "Oh, they're here right now."
[02:22:25.580 --> 02:22:26.900]   You know, they just happen to be here right now.
[02:22:26.900 --> 02:22:28.580]   And also, the very important thing,
[02:22:28.580 --> 02:22:31.060]   I call this the high beam argument.
[02:22:31.060 --> 02:22:32.580]   You know, to deal with the UFO stuff,
[02:22:32.580 --> 02:22:33.740]   you have to deal with all of,
[02:22:33.740 --> 02:22:36.180]   you have to answer these weird, irrational things
[02:22:36.180 --> 02:22:37.020]   that are happening.
[02:22:37.020 --> 02:22:39.380]   Like, okay, there's an advanced civilization
[02:22:39.380 --> 02:22:41.820]   that is visiting Earth regularly.
[02:22:41.820 --> 02:22:43.540]   They don't wanna be detected.
[02:22:43.540 --> 02:22:45.740]   They've got super powerful technology,
[02:22:45.740 --> 02:22:47.380]   but they really suck at using it
[02:22:47.380 --> 02:22:49.100]   because we keep seeing them.
[02:22:49.100 --> 02:22:51.340]   We keep seeing them, but then they disappear, right?
[02:22:51.340 --> 02:22:55.820]   I mean, explain to me what rational world that works under.
[02:22:55.820 --> 02:22:58.220]   It's like, you know, so there's that whole sort of argument
[02:22:58.220 --> 02:22:59.060]   you've got to explain.
[02:22:59.060 --> 02:23:01.180]   Like, why, if they want to stay hidden,
[02:23:01.180 --> 02:23:03.500]   are they so bad at it?
[02:23:03.500 --> 02:23:07.580]   So, you know, that's why I take that level of difficulty.
[02:23:07.580 --> 02:23:10.020]   And then I put it on top of, where should I look?
[02:23:10.020 --> 02:23:12.620]   I should look at the, you know,
[02:23:12.620 --> 02:23:14.860]   I should look at where they're from.
[02:23:14.860 --> 02:23:17.900]   That makes me wanna look at, do the telescopic stuff.
[02:23:17.900 --> 02:23:20.300]   - Yeah, I think the more likely explanation
[02:23:20.300 --> 02:23:24.420]   is either the sensors are not working correctly
[02:23:24.420 --> 02:23:27.580]   or it's secret military technology being tested.
[02:23:27.580 --> 02:23:28.420]   - Absolutely.
[02:23:28.420 --> 02:23:29.660]   I mean, if you had, listen, that's why, again,
[02:23:29.660 --> 02:23:32.460]   I think UAP, you know, absolutely,
[02:23:32.460 --> 02:23:35.260]   UAP should be studied scientifically.
[02:23:36.580 --> 02:23:38.420]   But if I had to make a bet and it's just a bet,
[02:23:38.420 --> 02:23:39.380]   I would say this is, you know,
[02:23:39.380 --> 02:23:41.700]   this is peer state adversary stuff.
[02:23:41.700 --> 02:23:45.460]   When I did, I did a New York Times op-ed for this in 2021,
[02:23:45.460 --> 02:23:46.660]   which, you know, blew up.
[02:23:46.660 --> 02:23:49.140]   And so, you know, I had a lot of, you know,
[02:23:49.140 --> 02:23:50.100]   people talking to me.
[02:23:50.100 --> 02:23:50.940]   While I was doing that,
[02:23:50.940 --> 02:23:53.060]   I sort of looked at the signals intelligence people,
[02:23:53.060 --> 02:23:57.300]   the SIGINT and EINT, electronic intelligence communities,
[02:23:57.300 --> 02:23:58.540]   and what they were saying about, you know,
[02:23:58.540 --> 02:24:01.780]   the New York Times articles and the various videos.
[02:24:01.780 --> 02:24:03.420]   And really none of them were talking about UFOs.
[02:24:03.420 --> 02:24:05.340]   They were all talking about, you know, peer state.
[02:24:05.340 --> 02:24:07.580]   That's where I learned the word peer state adversaries.
[02:24:07.580 --> 02:24:10.900]   How like even simple drone technologies, you can, you know,
[02:24:10.900 --> 02:24:12.380]   and you want to, you purposely want to do this.
[02:24:12.380 --> 02:24:15.100]   You want to fake, you know,
[02:24:15.100 --> 02:24:18.860]   signals into the electronics of their adversary
[02:24:18.860 --> 02:24:20.020]   so they crank it up.
[02:24:20.020 --> 02:24:21.260]   So then you can just soak up
[02:24:21.260 --> 02:24:22.980]   all the electromagnetic radiation
[02:24:22.980 --> 02:24:25.860]   and know exactly what those advanced radars can do.
[02:24:25.860 --> 02:24:28.540]   - That said, I'm not saying that that's what this is.
[02:24:28.540 --> 02:24:31.620]   If I was the head of an alien civilization
[02:24:31.620 --> 02:24:36.620]   and I chose to minimize the amount of contact I'm doing,
[02:24:36.620 --> 02:24:40.580]   I would try to figure out what would these humans,
[02:24:40.580 --> 02:24:43.600]   what would these aliens like to see?
[02:24:43.600 --> 02:24:47.620]   That's why like the big heads in the humanoid form.
[02:24:47.620 --> 02:24:48.460]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:24:48.460 --> 02:24:50.140]   - Like, I mean, that's kind of like
[02:24:50.140 --> 02:24:52.020]   how I would approach communication.
[02:24:52.020 --> 02:24:53.660]   If I was much more intelligent,
[02:24:53.660 --> 02:24:55.520]   I would observe them enough.
[02:24:55.520 --> 02:24:56.360]   It's like, all right,
[02:24:56.360 --> 02:24:59.220]   if I wanted to communicate with a nail colony,
[02:24:59.220 --> 02:25:01.180]   I would observe it long enough to see
[02:25:01.180 --> 02:25:03.240]   what are the basic elements of communication.
[02:25:03.240 --> 02:25:04.300]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:25:04.300 --> 02:25:05.700]   - And maybe I would do a trivial thing,
[02:25:05.700 --> 02:25:07.580]   like do like a fake ant.
[02:25:07.580 --> 02:25:08.420]   - Right, a robot ant.
[02:25:08.420 --> 02:25:09.820]   - Or a robot ant.
[02:25:09.820 --> 02:25:11.860]   But then it's not enough to just do a robot ant.
[02:25:11.860 --> 02:25:12.980]   You'd have to do a robot ant
[02:25:12.980 --> 02:25:15.060]   that like moves in the way they do.
[02:25:15.060 --> 02:25:18.540]   And maybe aliens are just shitty at doing the robot ants.
[02:25:18.540 --> 02:25:20.300]   But no, I do sort of,
[02:25:20.300 --> 02:25:21.660]   I just wanted to make the case for that.
[02:25:21.660 --> 02:25:22.620]   - This is the plot, actually,
[02:25:22.620 --> 02:25:26.260]   of a great science fiction book called "Eon" by Greg Baer.
[02:25:26.260 --> 02:25:28.180]   And the idea was like these sort of, you know,
[02:25:28.180 --> 02:25:29.900]   this is actually where my first,
[02:25:29.900 --> 02:25:34.420]   I became sort of more than agnostic, anti-METI.
[02:25:34.420 --> 02:25:36.500]   Because the idea is that, yes, our aliens come,
[02:25:36.500 --> 02:25:38.500]   they sort of make their arrival.
[02:25:38.500 --> 02:25:40.380]   And really their point is to get rid of us.
[02:25:40.380 --> 02:25:43.180]   It's the dark forest hypothesis.
[02:25:43.180 --> 02:25:44.380]   And what they do is they sort of,
[02:25:44.380 --> 02:25:46.580]   literally the way they present themselves
[02:25:46.580 --> 02:25:49.020]   is in this sort of classic UFO thing.
[02:25:49.020 --> 02:25:50.820]   And they do it, and they arrive at the,
[02:25:50.820 --> 02:25:52.000]   this was during the Soviet Union,
[02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:53.660]   they arrive at the USSR, they arrive in China.
[02:25:53.660 --> 02:25:55.540]   And they're kind of faking us out
[02:25:55.540 --> 02:25:58.700]   so that we never can organize ourselves against.
[02:25:58.700 --> 02:26:00.180]   So it was really, they did exactly
[02:26:00.180 --> 02:26:01.560]   kind of what you're talking about,
[02:26:01.560 --> 02:26:03.940]   but for nefarious purposes.
[02:26:03.940 --> 02:26:06.580]   - Okay, let me ask the pothead question.
[02:26:06.580 --> 02:26:07.900]   Yet another pothead- - Yet another pothead,
[02:26:07.900 --> 02:26:09.180]   the whole conversation. - I'm sorry.
[02:26:09.180 --> 02:26:11.220]   I'm sorry. - Bogs before breakfast.
[02:26:11.220 --> 02:26:14.340]   - It's science and pothead questions back and forth.
[02:26:14.340 --> 02:26:17.620]   Okay, what if aliens take a form
[02:26:17.620 --> 02:26:20.860]   that's unlike what we kind of traditionally
[02:26:20.860 --> 02:26:26.340]   envision in analyzing physical objects?
[02:26:26.340 --> 02:26:28.660]   What if they take the form of, say, ideas?
[02:26:28.660 --> 02:26:33.660]   What if, real pothead, if it's consciousness itself,
[02:26:33.660 --> 02:26:37.960]   like the subjective experience, is an alien being?
[02:26:37.960 --> 02:26:40.320]   Maybe ideas then is an easier one to visualize
[02:26:40.320 --> 02:26:42.820]   'cause we can think of ideas as entities
[02:26:42.820 --> 02:26:44.300]   traveling from human to human.
[02:26:44.300 --> 02:26:46.900]   - When I made the claim that the most important,
[02:26:46.900 --> 02:26:48.980]   that finding life, any kind of life,
[02:26:48.980 --> 02:26:51.740]   would be the most important discovery in human history.
[02:26:51.740 --> 02:26:53.280]   And one of the reasons is, again, as I said,
[02:26:53.280 --> 02:26:56.000]   that life, if we're not an accident,
[02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:57.620]   and there's other life,
[02:26:57.620 --> 02:26:58.940]   then there's probably lots of other life.
[02:26:58.940 --> 02:27:02.500]   And because the most significant thing about life is
[02:27:02.500 --> 02:27:03.760]   it can innovate, right?
[02:27:03.760 --> 02:27:08.620]   If I give you a star and tell you the mass
[02:27:08.620 --> 02:27:09.980]   and the composition, you can basically,
[02:27:09.980 --> 02:27:11.180]   pretty much using the laws of physics,
[02:27:11.180 --> 02:27:12.620]   tell exactly what's gonna happen to that star
[02:27:12.620 --> 02:27:13.600]   over its entire lifetime.
[02:27:13.600 --> 02:27:15.860]   Maybe not the little tiny details, but overall,
[02:27:15.860 --> 02:27:16.700]   it's gonna be a white dwarf,
[02:27:16.700 --> 02:27:18.060]   it's gonna be a black hole, end of story.
[02:27:18.060 --> 02:27:19.980]   If I gave you a single cell and said
[02:27:19.980 --> 02:27:21.340]   what's gonna happen in a few billion years,
[02:27:21.340 --> 02:27:23.820]   you'd never be able to predict a giant rabbit
[02:27:23.820 --> 02:27:26.420]   that can punch you in the face, right, a kangaroo.
[02:27:26.420 --> 02:27:28.660]   So life has this possibility of innovating,
[02:27:28.660 --> 02:27:29.940]   of being creative.
[02:27:29.940 --> 02:27:32.260]   So here's, so what it means is,
[02:27:32.260 --> 02:27:34.340]   and that's a part of a kind of a fundamental definition
[02:27:34.340 --> 02:27:35.500]   of what it means to be alive.
[02:27:35.500 --> 02:27:37.260]   It goes past itself.
[02:27:37.260 --> 02:27:41.060]   So give life enough time, you know,
[02:27:41.060 --> 02:27:44.100]   and what are the, what are the end result?
[02:27:44.100 --> 02:27:44.940]   Like, you know, there's, there's, you know,
[02:27:44.940 --> 02:27:47.500]   like, that's why I love science fiction so much.
[02:27:47.500 --> 02:27:50.100]   It does, at some point, does life reach a point
[02:27:50.100 --> 02:27:52.740]   where it climbs into the laws of physics itself?
[02:27:52.740 --> 02:27:54.340]   It becomes the laws of physics.
[02:27:54.340 --> 02:27:57.980]   Or, you know, these sort of lie at the extreme limits
[02:27:57.980 --> 02:28:00.540]   of thinking about what we mean by reality,
[02:28:00.540 --> 02:28:03.740]   what we mean by, you know, experience.
[02:28:03.740 --> 02:28:06.100]   But, and I'm not sure there's much we can do
[02:28:06.100 --> 02:28:07.980]   with them scientifically, but it, you know,
[02:28:07.980 --> 02:28:10.540]   they're open-ended question about the open-ended nature
[02:28:10.540 --> 02:28:14.940]   of what it means to be alive and what life can do.
[02:28:14.940 --> 02:28:17.660]   - Since you said it's the biggest question,
[02:28:17.660 --> 02:28:19.540]   which is an interesting thought experiment.
[02:28:19.540 --> 02:28:20.900]   What is the biggest scientific question
[02:28:20.900 --> 02:28:22.660]   we can possibly answer?
[02:28:22.660 --> 02:28:24.500]   You know, some people might say about, like,
[02:28:24.500 --> 02:28:26.380]   what happened before the big bang,
[02:28:26.380 --> 02:28:28.860]   some big physics questions about the universe.
[02:28:28.860 --> 02:28:33.020]   I can see the argument for, you know,
[02:28:33.020 --> 02:28:34.260]   how many alien civilizations,
[02:28:34.260 --> 02:28:36.860]   or if there's other life out there.
[02:28:36.860 --> 02:28:38.140]   You want to speak to that a little bit?
[02:28:38.140 --> 02:28:38.960]   Like, why?
[02:28:38.960 --> 02:28:39.800]   - Why is the?
[02:28:39.800 --> 02:28:41.940]   - Why is it the biggest question in your,
[02:28:41.940 --> 02:28:43.900]   why is it number one in your top five, or?
[02:28:43.900 --> 02:28:45.180]   - I've evolved in this, right?
[02:28:45.180 --> 02:28:46.860]   You know, I started off as a theoretical physicist.
[02:28:46.860 --> 02:28:49.060]   I went into computational astrophysics
[02:28:49.060 --> 02:28:50.940]   and magnetohydrodynamics of star formation.
[02:28:50.940 --> 02:28:52.340]   But I always, you know, I was a philosophy minor.
[02:28:52.340 --> 02:28:54.420]   I always had the sort of bigger questions
[02:28:54.420 --> 02:28:56.420]   sort of floating around the back of my mind.
[02:28:56.420 --> 02:28:59.580]   And what I've come to now is the most important question
[02:28:59.580 --> 02:29:01.660]   for physics is what is life?
[02:29:01.660 --> 02:29:02.740]   What the hell is the difference
[02:29:02.740 --> 02:29:05.820]   between a rock and a cell, fundamentally?
[02:29:05.820 --> 02:29:06.900]   And what I really mean by this,
[02:29:06.900 --> 02:29:09.220]   and this is where I'm going to go non-traditional,
[02:29:09.220 --> 02:29:13.260]   is that really the fundamental question that is agency.
[02:29:13.260 --> 02:29:15.580]   What does it mean to be an autonomous agent?
[02:29:15.580 --> 02:29:17.660]   How the hell does that happen?
[02:29:17.660 --> 02:29:19.980]   You know, it's so, I'm not a reductionist.
[02:29:19.980 --> 02:29:20.820]   I'm not somebody who's just like,
[02:29:20.820 --> 02:29:22.180]   well, you just put together enough chemicals
[02:29:22.180 --> 02:29:24.180]   and bing, bang, boom, and you know, it suddenly appears.
[02:29:24.180 --> 02:29:26.580]   There's something that really is going to demand
[02:29:26.580 --> 02:29:30.780]   a reconception of what nature itself is.
[02:29:30.780 --> 02:29:32.420]   And so yeah, black holes are super cool.
[02:29:32.420 --> 02:29:33.860]   Cosmology is super cool.
[02:29:33.860 --> 02:29:38.340]   But really this question of what is life,
[02:29:38.340 --> 02:29:41.620]   especially from by viewing it from the inside,
[02:29:41.620 --> 02:29:43.620]   because it's really about the verb to be, right?
[02:29:43.620 --> 02:29:44.500]   Really, what is the most,
[02:29:44.500 --> 02:29:46.900]   what is the most impressing philosophical question
[02:29:46.900 --> 02:29:49.100]   beyond science is the verb to be.
[02:29:49.100 --> 02:29:51.740]   What is being, right?
[02:29:51.740 --> 02:29:53.180]   This is what Stephen Hawking said
[02:29:53.180 --> 02:29:55.980]   when he talked about what puts the fire in the equations?
[02:29:55.980 --> 02:29:56.980]   The fire, right?
[02:29:56.980 --> 02:29:59.500]   The fire is this presence.
[02:29:59.500 --> 02:30:00.940]   And this is where it touches things like,
[02:30:00.940 --> 02:30:02.060]   you know, whatever you want to say it,
[02:30:02.060 --> 02:30:04.300]   the sacred, spirituality, whatever you want to talk about.
[02:30:04.300 --> 02:30:08.300]   My first book was about science and human spirituality.
[02:30:08.300 --> 02:30:10.560]   So it's like, you know, so this question of life,
[02:30:10.560 --> 02:30:14.100]   what makes life as a physical system, you know,
[02:30:14.100 --> 02:30:17.180]   so different is to me much more,
[02:30:17.180 --> 02:30:18.700]   because it's, you know, that's where being appears.
[02:30:18.700 --> 02:30:21.300]   Being doesn't appear out there, right?
[02:30:21.300 --> 02:30:24.100]   The only place that ever appears to any of us is us.
[02:30:24.100 --> 02:30:26.380]   So, you know, I can do this kind of projection
[02:30:26.380 --> 02:30:28.460]   into this third person thing, but nobody ever has that,
[02:30:28.460 --> 02:30:29.700]   that God's eye view.
[02:30:29.700 --> 02:30:31.160]   That's a story we tell.
[02:30:31.160 --> 02:30:32.740]   This is where, you know,
[02:30:32.740 --> 02:30:36.860]   this between us is where the verb to be appears.
[02:30:36.860 --> 02:30:39.300]   - So this is something that you write about
[02:30:39.300 --> 02:30:40.780]   in "The Blind Spot,"
[02:30:40.780 --> 02:30:43.920]   why science cannot ignore human experience,
[02:30:43.920 --> 02:30:46.060]   sort of trying to pull the fire
[02:30:47.260 --> 02:30:52.260]   into the process of science.
[02:30:52.260 --> 02:30:54.820]   And it's a kind of critique of materialism.
[02:30:54.820 --> 02:30:56.620]   Can you explain the main thesis of this book?
[02:30:56.620 --> 02:30:58.980]   - Yeah, so the idea of "The Blind Spot"
[02:30:58.980 --> 02:31:03.780]   is that there is this thing that is central to science.
[02:31:03.780 --> 02:31:05.580]   So the blind, we're using the blind spot as a metaphor,
[02:31:05.580 --> 02:31:07.700]   right, so the eye has an optic nerve,
[02:31:07.700 --> 02:31:11.180]   and the optic nerve is what allows vision to happen.
[02:31:11.180 --> 02:31:13.240]   So you can't have vision without the optic nerve,
[02:31:13.240 --> 02:31:15.100]   but actually you're blind to the optic nerve.
[02:31:15.100 --> 02:31:16.420]   There's a little hole in your vision
[02:31:16.420 --> 02:31:17.900]   where the optic nerve is.
[02:31:17.900 --> 02:31:19.980]   And what we're saying is that science
[02:31:19.980 --> 02:31:21.500]   has something like this.
[02:31:21.500 --> 02:31:24.220]   There is something that without which
[02:31:24.220 --> 02:31:25.500]   science would not be possible,
[02:31:25.500 --> 02:31:27.700]   but that science, the way it's been configured,
[02:31:27.700 --> 02:31:29.500]   and actually when we mean the blind spot,
[02:31:29.500 --> 02:31:31.740]   get into exactly what I mean, what it is,
[02:31:31.740 --> 02:31:33.700]   but it's not really science.
[02:31:33.700 --> 02:31:37.260]   It is a set of ideas that got glued onto science.
[02:31:37.260 --> 02:31:40.380]   It's a metaphysics that got glued onto science.
[02:31:40.380 --> 02:31:42.500]   And so what is that thing that is,
[02:31:42.500 --> 02:31:43.340]   what is the blind spot?
[02:31:43.340 --> 02:31:44.160]   It's experience.
[02:31:44.160 --> 02:31:45.500]   It is presence.
[02:31:45.500 --> 02:31:47.340]   And by experience, people have to be very careful
[02:31:47.340 --> 02:31:49.120]   'cause I'm not talking about being an observer.
[02:31:49.120 --> 02:31:51.380]   It's the, you know, there's lots of words for it.
[02:31:51.380 --> 02:31:53.000]   There's direct experience.
[02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:57.860]   There is presence, being, the life world
[02:31:57.860 --> 02:31:59.680]   within the philosophy called phenomenology.
[02:31:59.680 --> 02:32:00.520]   There's the life world.
[02:32:00.520 --> 02:32:03.160]   It's this sort of raw presence
[02:32:03.160 --> 02:32:05.020]   that you can't get away from until you die.
[02:32:05.020 --> 02:32:06.300]   And then who the hell knows, you know?
[02:32:06.300 --> 02:32:08.920]   That like, you know, as long as you're around, it's there.
[02:32:08.920 --> 02:32:11.260]   And what we're saying is that that is the,
[02:32:11.260 --> 02:32:12.100]   the way to say this,
[02:32:12.100 --> 02:32:17.100]   that is the precondition for the possibility of science.
[02:32:17.100 --> 02:32:19.380]   And the whole nature of science,
[02:32:19.380 --> 02:32:23.620]   the way it has evolved is that it purposely pushed that out.
[02:32:23.620 --> 02:32:26.420]   It pushed that out so it could make progress.
[02:32:26.420 --> 02:32:29.180]   And that's fine for a certain class of problems.
[02:32:29.180 --> 02:32:33.100]   But when we try to answer, when we try and go deeper,
[02:32:33.100 --> 02:32:34.860]   there's a whole other class of problems.
[02:32:34.860 --> 02:32:37.660]   The nature of consciousness, the nature of time,
[02:32:37.660 --> 02:32:40.340]   quantum mechanics, that comes back to bite us.
[02:32:40.340 --> 02:32:43.740]   And that if we don't learn how to take,
[02:32:43.740 --> 02:32:45.940]   understand that that is always the background,
[02:32:45.940 --> 02:32:47.940]   that experience is always the background,
[02:32:47.940 --> 02:32:50.220]   then we just end up with these paradoxes and prop,
[02:32:50.220 --> 02:32:52.860]   these yoga that require this intellectual yoga
[02:32:52.860 --> 02:32:53.700]   to get out of.
[02:32:53.700 --> 02:32:55.280]   - I think you give a bunch of examples of that,
[02:32:55.280 --> 02:32:57.700]   like looking at temperature as a number.
[02:32:57.700 --> 02:32:59.460]   There's a very sort of objective scientific way
[02:32:59.460 --> 02:33:00.300]   of looking at that.
[02:33:00.300 --> 02:33:02.180]   And then there's the experience of the temperature.
[02:33:02.180 --> 02:33:04.180]   - And how you build the parable of temperature
[02:33:04.180 --> 02:33:05.620]   that we call it.
[02:33:05.620 --> 02:33:07.060]   So what is the blind spot?
[02:33:07.060 --> 02:33:08.860]   We use the term, it's a constellation.
[02:33:08.860 --> 02:33:10.180]   It's not just materialism.
[02:33:10.180 --> 02:33:11.500]   It's a constellation of ideas
[02:33:11.500 --> 02:33:13.740]   that are all really sort of philosophical views.
[02:33:13.740 --> 02:33:15.660]   They're not what science says,
[02:33:15.660 --> 02:33:18.460]   but because of the evolution of the history of science
[02:33:18.460 --> 02:33:21.180]   and culture, they got like pin the tail on a donkey.
[02:33:21.180 --> 02:33:23.920]   They were sort of pinned on and to tell us
[02:33:23.920 --> 02:33:24.980]   that this is what science says.
[02:33:24.980 --> 02:33:25.820]   So what is it?
[02:33:25.820 --> 02:33:28.080]   One is reductionism, that you are nothing
[02:33:28.080 --> 02:33:32.120]   but your nerve cells, which are nothing but the chemistry,
[02:33:32.120 --> 02:33:35.180]   which is nothing but, all the way down to quarks, that's it.
[02:33:35.180 --> 02:33:36.380]   So that's reductionism.
[02:33:36.380 --> 02:33:39.300]   The objective frame that science gives us this God's eye view
[02:33:39.300 --> 02:33:41.340]   this third person view of the world
[02:33:41.340 --> 02:33:43.620]   to view the world from the outside,
[02:33:43.620 --> 02:33:46.680]   that that's what science bequeaths to us that view.
[02:33:46.680 --> 02:33:48.700]   Physicalism, that everything in the world
[02:33:48.700 --> 02:33:50.800]   is basically made of stuff.
[02:33:50.800 --> 02:33:52.900]   There's nothing else to talk about, right?
[02:33:52.900 --> 02:33:54.100]   That that's all there is
[02:33:54.100 --> 02:33:55.820]   and everything can be reduced to that.
[02:33:55.820 --> 02:33:57.500]   And then also the reification of mathematics
[02:33:57.500 --> 02:34:01.180]   that mathematics is somehow more real than this.
[02:34:01.180 --> 02:34:02.220]   And there's a bunch of other things,
[02:34:02.220 --> 02:34:04.620]   but all these together, what they all do
[02:34:04.620 --> 02:34:06.920]   is they end up pushing experience out
[02:34:06.920 --> 02:34:09.180]   and saying experience is an epiphenomena.
[02:34:09.180 --> 02:34:12.060]   Consciousness, I tend not to use the word consciousness
[02:34:12.060 --> 02:34:14.020]   'cause I think it gets, you know,
[02:34:14.020 --> 02:34:15.460]   it leads us in the wrong direction.
[02:34:15.460 --> 02:34:18.180]   We should focus on experience 'cause it's a verb
[02:34:18.180 --> 02:34:20.720]   kind of in a way or it's verb-like.
[02:34:20.720 --> 02:34:24.300]   So yeah, and that this, by being blind to that,
[02:34:24.300 --> 02:34:27.420]   we end up with these paradoxes and problems
[02:34:27.420 --> 02:34:29.760]   that really not only block science,
[02:34:29.760 --> 02:34:31.760]   but also have been detrimental to society as a whole,
[02:34:31.760 --> 02:34:33.460]   especially where we're at right now.
[02:34:33.460 --> 02:34:35.500]   - So you actually say that that,
[02:34:35.500 --> 02:34:37.620]   from a perspective of detrimental society,
[02:34:37.620 --> 02:34:39.660]   that there's a crisis of meaning
[02:34:39.660 --> 02:34:42.620]   and that we respond to that in a way
[02:34:42.620 --> 02:34:44.840]   that's counterproductive to these bigger questions,
[02:34:44.840 --> 02:34:46.260]   scientific questions.
[02:34:46.260 --> 02:34:48.860]   So the three ways, the three responses you mentioned
[02:34:48.860 --> 02:34:52.220]   is scientific triumphalism.
[02:34:52.220 --> 02:34:55.120]   And then on the other side is rejecting science completely,
[02:34:55.120 --> 02:34:57.180]   both on the left and the right, I think.
[02:34:57.180 --> 02:34:58.700]   The postmodernists on the left
[02:34:58.700 --> 02:35:01.540]   and the anti-establishment people on the right.
[02:35:01.540 --> 02:35:02.980]   And then just pseudoscience
[02:35:02.980 --> 02:35:04.980]   that kind of does this in-between thing.
[02:35:04.980 --> 02:35:07.420]   Can you just speak to those responses
[02:35:07.420 --> 02:35:08.800]   and to the crisis of meaning?
[02:35:08.800 --> 02:35:09.640]   - Right, right.
[02:35:09.640 --> 02:35:11.100]   So the crisis of meaning is that,
[02:35:11.100 --> 02:35:14.820]   on the one hand, science wants to tell us
[02:35:14.820 --> 02:35:16.540]   that we're insignificant, we're not important,
[02:35:16.540 --> 02:35:18.520]   we're just biological machines.
[02:35:18.520 --> 02:35:23.220]   So we're basically an insignificant part of the universe.
[02:35:23.220 --> 02:35:25.380]   On the other hand, we also find ourselves
[02:35:25.380 --> 02:35:27.260]   being completely significant.
[02:35:27.260 --> 02:35:28.960]   In cosmology, we have to figure out
[02:35:28.960 --> 02:35:32.340]   how to look from the inside at cosmology.
[02:35:32.340 --> 02:35:33.460]   We're always the observers.
[02:35:33.460 --> 02:35:37.100]   We're at the center of this collapsing wave front of light.
[02:35:38.100 --> 02:35:40.160]   You know, in quantum mechanics, it really comes in.
[02:35:40.160 --> 02:35:41.780]   It comes in, you know, the measurement problem
[02:35:41.780 --> 02:35:43.100]   just puts us front and center.
[02:35:43.100 --> 02:35:44.940]   We've spent 100, some people have spent 100 years
[02:35:44.940 --> 02:35:46.660]   trying to ignore the measurement part
[02:35:46.660 --> 02:35:47.700]   of the measurement problem.
[02:35:47.700 --> 02:35:49.340]   So on the one hand, we're insignificant,
[02:35:49.340 --> 02:35:50.820]   and on the other hand, we're central.
[02:35:50.820 --> 02:35:52.900]   So which one is it, right?
[02:35:52.900 --> 02:35:55.700]   And so this all comes from not understanding
[02:35:55.700 --> 02:35:57.760]   actually the foundational role of experience,
[02:35:57.760 --> 02:36:01.300]   this inability, we can't do science
[02:36:01.300 --> 02:36:03.760]   without already being present in the world.
[02:36:03.760 --> 02:36:06.540]   We can't reduce what happens in science
[02:36:06.540 --> 02:36:08.780]   to some sort of formal, a lot of it is about,
[02:36:08.780 --> 02:36:11.460]   we love our formal systems, you know, our mathematics,
[02:36:11.460 --> 02:36:12.700]   and we're substituting.
[02:36:12.700 --> 02:36:14.540]   That's one of the things that we,
[02:36:14.540 --> 02:36:17.020]   there's two philosophers we really like who are heroes.
[02:36:17.020 --> 02:36:20.220]   One is Herschel, who is a mathematician
[02:36:20.220 --> 02:36:23.860]   who invented phenomenology, and the other is Whitehead,
[02:36:23.860 --> 02:36:25.620]   who was one of the greatest mathematicians
[02:36:25.620 --> 02:36:27.620]   of the 20th century.
[02:36:27.620 --> 02:36:28.820]   And Herschel came up with this idea
[02:36:28.820 --> 02:36:30.620]   of the surreptitious substitution.
[02:36:30.620 --> 02:36:34.220]   Part of the blind spot is substituting a formal system,
[02:36:34.220 --> 02:36:37.580]   a calculus of, you know, data for actual experience,
[02:36:37.580 --> 02:36:39.820]   that that's more important than,
[02:36:39.820 --> 02:36:40.660]   and so let me just do,
[02:36:40.660 --> 02:36:42.520]   before I go to those three responses,
[02:36:42.520 --> 02:36:43.900]   let's just do the parable of temperature,
[02:36:43.900 --> 02:36:45.560]   'cause I think it'll, people can,
[02:36:45.560 --> 02:36:48.280]   it'll help them understand what we mean.
[02:36:48.280 --> 02:36:51.500]   So think about degrees Celsius, right?
[02:36:51.500 --> 02:36:54.060]   We kind of have, in the modern scientific culture we live in,
[02:36:54.060 --> 02:36:56.220]   we think like, oh yeah, degrees Celsius, they're out there.
[02:36:56.220 --> 02:36:59.220]   The universe, it's, you know, the molecular cloud in space
[02:36:59.220 --> 02:37:01.220]   is 10 degrees, you know, Kelvin.
[02:37:02.540 --> 02:37:05.740]   The way we got there is we've forgotten
[02:37:05.740 --> 02:37:09.020]   how that idea is rooted in experience, right?
[02:37:09.020 --> 02:37:10.900]   We started off with science by,
[02:37:10.900 --> 02:37:11.740]   we had the experience,
[02:37:11.740 --> 02:37:13.500]   the subjective experience of hot and cold.
[02:37:13.500 --> 02:37:17.260]   I feel hot, I feel cold, you feel hot, you feel cold.
[02:37:17.260 --> 02:37:20.260]   Science was this process of trying to extract
[02:37:20.260 --> 02:37:23.640]   from those experiences what Michel Bitbol, a philosopher,
[02:37:23.640 --> 02:37:25.200]   calls the structural invariance,
[02:37:25.200 --> 02:37:28.120]   the things that like we could both kind of agree on.
[02:37:28.120 --> 02:37:29.560]   So, you know, we figured out like,
[02:37:29.560 --> 02:37:31.900]   oh, we could make a gradiated little cylinder
[02:37:31.900 --> 02:37:32.940]   that's got mercury in it.
[02:37:32.940 --> 02:37:36.780]   And that, you know, hot things will be higher in that,
[02:37:36.780 --> 02:37:38.300]   you know, on that gradiated cylinder,
[02:37:38.300 --> 02:37:39.860]   cold things will be lower.
[02:37:39.860 --> 02:37:41.180]   And we can both kind of figure out
[02:37:41.180 --> 02:37:43.720]   what we're gonna agree on our standards for that.
[02:37:43.720 --> 02:37:46.220]   And then we have thermometry, yay.
[02:37:46.220 --> 02:37:48.780]   We have a way of sort of like having a structural invariant
[02:37:48.780 --> 02:37:53.220]   of this sort of very personal experience of hot or cold.
[02:37:53.220 --> 02:37:54.060]   And then from that,
[02:37:54.060 --> 02:37:56.020]   we can come up with thermodynamics, et cetera.
[02:37:56.020 --> 02:37:58.580]   And then we end up as at the bottom of,
[02:37:58.580 --> 02:37:59.740]   you know, at the end of that,
[02:37:59.740 --> 02:38:01.220]   with this idea of like every day I wake up
[02:38:01.220 --> 02:38:02.300]   and I check my phone and I'm like,
[02:38:02.300 --> 02:38:04.700]   oh, it's gonna be, you know, 60 degrees out, great.
[02:38:04.700 --> 02:38:06.740]   And we start thinking that 60 degrees
[02:38:06.740 --> 02:38:08.900]   is more real than hot and cold.
[02:38:08.900 --> 02:38:09.780]   That thermodynamics,
[02:38:09.780 --> 02:38:12.360]   the whole formal structure of thermodynamics
[02:38:12.360 --> 02:38:16.100]   is more real than the basic experience of hot and cold
[02:38:16.100 --> 02:38:18.100]   that it came from.
[02:38:18.100 --> 02:38:22.260]   You know, it required that bodily experience
[02:38:22.260 --> 02:38:24.700]   that also, not just me, you, I have to tell, you know,
[02:38:24.700 --> 02:38:25.980]   it's part of my communication with you,
[02:38:25.980 --> 02:38:27.600]   cold today, isn't it, right?
[02:38:27.600 --> 02:38:31.080]   That from that basic irreducible experience
[02:38:31.080 --> 02:38:32.900]   of being in the world, you know,
[02:38:32.900 --> 02:38:34.300]   with everything that it involves,
[02:38:34.300 --> 02:38:36.740]   I developed degrees Celsius,
[02:38:36.740 --> 02:38:38.060]   but then I forgot about it.
[02:38:38.060 --> 02:38:39.140]   I forgot the experience.
[02:38:39.140 --> 02:38:41.380]   So that's called the amnesia of experience.
[02:38:41.380 --> 02:38:44.560]   So that's what we mean by the, you know,
[02:38:44.560 --> 02:38:47.140]   how the blind spot emerges, how we end up,
[02:38:47.140 --> 02:38:49.900]   how science purposely pushes experience out of the way
[02:38:49.900 --> 02:38:51.100]   so it can make progress,
[02:38:51.100 --> 02:38:54.780]   but then it forgets that experience was important.
[02:38:54.780 --> 02:38:55.620]   So where does this show up?
[02:38:55.620 --> 02:38:57.060]   Why is this, you know,
[02:38:57.060 --> 02:38:59.420]   what are the responses to trying to get this back in
[02:38:59.420 --> 02:39:01.840]   and where this crisis of meaning emerge?
[02:39:01.840 --> 02:39:04.820]   So scientific triumphalism is the idea that only,
[02:39:04.820 --> 02:39:07.760]   the only thing that's true for us are scientific truths,
[02:39:07.760 --> 02:39:10.640]   right, unless it can be codified in a formal system
[02:39:10.640 --> 02:39:12.680]   and represented as data, you know,
[02:39:12.680 --> 02:39:16.760]   captured in some kind of scientific causal network,
[02:39:16.760 --> 02:39:18.100]   it doesn't even exist, right?
[02:39:18.100 --> 02:39:21.280]   And anything else that's not part of it,
[02:39:21.280 --> 02:39:23.080]   part that can be formalized in that way
[02:39:23.080 --> 02:39:25.480]   is an epiphenomenon, it's not real.
[02:39:25.480 --> 02:39:29.400]   So, you know, scientific triumphalism is this response
[02:39:29.400 --> 02:39:32.160]   to the mist, you know, the weirdness of,
[02:39:32.160 --> 02:39:33.040]   you know, I could call it the mystery,
[02:39:33.040 --> 02:39:34.240]   the weirdness of experience
[02:39:34.240 --> 02:39:36.100]   by kind of just ignoring it completely.
[02:39:36.100 --> 02:39:39.980]   So there's no other truth, you know, art, music,
[02:39:39.980 --> 02:39:41.520]   you know, human spirituality,
[02:39:41.520 --> 02:39:45.440]   it's all actually reducible just to neural correlates.
[02:39:45.440 --> 02:39:47.660]   So that's one way that it's been dealt with.
[02:39:47.660 --> 02:39:48.880]   The other way is this sort of, right,
[02:39:48.880 --> 02:39:51.540]   you've got on the postmodern, you know,
[02:39:51.540 --> 02:39:52.840]   the left, academic left,
[02:39:52.840 --> 02:39:54.840]   you get this thing like science is just a game,
[02:39:54.840 --> 02:39:59.000]   you know, it's just a game from the powerful come up with,
[02:39:59.000 --> 02:39:59.900]   which is also not true.
[02:39:59.900 --> 02:40:02.920]   Science is totally potent and requires an account
[02:40:02.920 --> 02:40:04.460]   for what is happening.
[02:40:04.460 --> 02:40:07.080]   So that's another way to push sort of science away
[02:40:07.080 --> 02:40:08.080]   or respond to it.
[02:40:08.080 --> 02:40:10.120]   The denial, science denial that happens,
[02:40:10.120 --> 02:40:12.880]   that's also another way of sort of, you know,
[02:40:12.880 --> 02:40:16.600]   not understanding the balance that science is trying,
[02:40:16.600 --> 02:40:18.960]   that we need to establish with experience.
[02:40:18.960 --> 02:40:20.260]   And then there's just pseudoscience,
[02:40:20.260 --> 02:40:22.200]   which wants to sort of say like, oh, you know,
[02:40:22.200 --> 02:40:23.840]   the new age movement or whatever,
[02:40:23.840 --> 02:40:25.440]   which wants to have, you know,
[02:40:25.440 --> 02:40:27.880]   wants to deal with experience by kind of elevating it
[02:40:27.880 --> 02:40:29.800]   in this weird pseudo-spiritual way,
[02:40:29.800 --> 02:40:33.580]   or, you know, that doesn't have the rigor of science.
[02:40:33.580 --> 02:40:36.760]   So, you know, all of these ways, all of these responses,
[02:40:36.760 --> 02:40:39.140]   we have this difficulty about experience.
[02:40:39.140 --> 02:40:41.800]   We need to understand how experience
[02:40:41.800 --> 02:40:43.580]   fits into the web of meaning.
[02:40:43.580 --> 02:40:46.320]   And we don't really have an accurate,
[02:40:46.320 --> 02:40:47.520]   we don't have a good way of doing it yet.
[02:40:47.520 --> 02:40:50.400]   And the point of the book was to identify very clearly
[02:40:50.400 --> 02:40:52.780]   how the problem manifests, what the problem is,
[02:40:52.780 --> 02:40:55.800]   and what its effects are in the various sciences.
[02:40:55.800 --> 02:40:57.900]   - And by the way, we should mention that
[02:40:57.900 --> 02:41:01.280]   at least the first two responses,
[02:41:01.280 --> 02:41:02.920]   they kind of feed each other.
[02:41:02.920 --> 02:41:06.080]   There's a, just to observe the scientific community,
[02:41:06.080 --> 02:41:08.320]   those who sort of gravitate a little bit
[02:41:08.320 --> 02:41:11.860]   towards the scientific triumphalism,
[02:41:11.860 --> 02:41:16.860]   they, there's an arrogance that builds in the human soul.
[02:41:16.860 --> 02:41:19.760]   If you, I mean, it has to do with PhDs,
[02:41:19.760 --> 02:41:21.720]   it has to do with sitting on the academic throne,
[02:41:21.720 --> 02:41:24.320]   all of those things, and the human nature
[02:41:24.320 --> 02:41:26.080]   with the egos and so on, it builds.
[02:41:26.080 --> 02:41:28.560]   And of course that, nobody likes arrogance.
[02:41:28.560 --> 02:41:31.000]   And so those that reject science,
[02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:33.440]   the arrogance is fuel for the people that reject science.
[02:41:33.440 --> 02:41:34.280]   - I absolutely agree.
[02:41:34.280 --> 02:41:37.360]   - It just goes back, and it's just this divide that builds.
[02:41:37.360 --> 02:41:38.220]   - Yeah, no, and that was a problem.
[02:41:38.220 --> 02:41:39.480]   Like when you saw, so like I said, you know,
[02:41:39.480 --> 02:41:42.040]   my first book was about science and human spirituality.
[02:41:42.040 --> 02:41:43.760]   So I was trying to say that like, you know,
[02:41:43.760 --> 02:41:46.960]   science is actually, if we look at what happens
[02:41:46.960 --> 02:41:48.400]   in human spirituality, not religion,
[02:41:48.400 --> 02:41:50.200]   religion's about politics, right?
[02:41:50.200 --> 02:41:52.360]   But about, you know, for the entire history of the species,
[02:41:52.360 --> 02:41:55.600]   we've had this experience of, for lack of a better word,
[02:41:55.600 --> 02:41:56.600]   the sacredness.
[02:41:56.600 --> 02:41:58.280]   I'm not connecting this God or anything.
[02:41:58.280 --> 02:42:01.200]   I'm just saying this experience of like the more.
[02:42:01.200 --> 02:42:03.280]   And then, you know, with the new atheist movement,
[02:42:03.280 --> 02:42:05.120]   you got people saying that like,
[02:42:05.120 --> 02:42:07.240]   anybody who feels that is an idiot.
[02:42:07.240 --> 02:42:11.000]   You know, they just can't handle the hardcore science,
[02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:15.520]   when in fact their views of the world are so denuded of,
[02:42:15.520 --> 02:42:17.680]   they can't even see the role that experience plays
[02:42:17.680 --> 02:42:19.800]   in how they came up with their formal systems.
[02:42:19.800 --> 02:42:21.920]   You know, and experience fundamentally is weird.
[02:42:21.920 --> 02:42:22.880]   You know, mysterious.
[02:42:22.880 --> 02:42:26.080]   It's like, it kind of goes down forever in some sense.
[02:42:26.080 --> 02:42:27.240]   There is always more.
[02:42:27.240 --> 02:42:28.680]   So yeah, that arrogance then just,
[02:42:28.680 --> 02:42:31.640]   if you're telling everybody who's not hardcore enough
[02:42:31.640 --> 02:42:33.960]   to do the, you know, standard model of cosmology,
[02:42:33.960 --> 02:42:35.840]   that they're idiots, that's not gonna bode well
[02:42:35.840 --> 02:42:37.920]   for your, you know, the advance of your project.
[02:42:37.920 --> 02:42:40.800]   - So you're proposing at least to consider the idea
[02:42:40.800 --> 02:42:43.880]   that experience is fundamental.
[02:42:43.880 --> 02:42:46.280]   Experience is not just an illusion
[02:42:46.280 --> 02:42:48.760]   that emerges from the set of quirks.
[02:42:48.760 --> 02:42:51.960]   There could be something about the conscious experience
[02:42:51.960 --> 02:42:56.040]   of the world that is like at the core of reality.
[02:42:56.040 --> 02:42:57.100]   - Yeah, but I wouldn't do it.
[02:42:57.100 --> 02:42:58.840]   I wouldn't, 'cause you know, there's panpsychism, right?
[02:42:58.840 --> 02:42:59.680]   Which wants to say that-- - Right, so that's
[02:42:59.680 --> 02:43:00.720]   all the way there.
[02:43:00.720 --> 02:43:02.160]   - Yeah. - Panpsychism is like,
[02:43:02.160 --> 02:43:04.120]   that's literally one of the laws of physics.
[02:43:04.120 --> 02:43:04.960]   - Right, right. - It's conscious.
[02:43:04.960 --> 02:43:07.240]   - But see, what all those do is like,
[02:43:07.240 --> 02:43:10.300]   just the idea of say like physicalism versus idealism,
[02:43:10.300 --> 02:43:12.040]   which are kind of the two philosophical schools
[02:43:12.040 --> 02:43:12.880]   you can go with.
[02:43:12.880 --> 02:43:14.640]   Physicalism says all that exists is physical.
[02:43:14.640 --> 02:43:16.800]   Idealism says all that exists is mind.
[02:43:16.800 --> 02:43:19.120]   We're actually saying, look, both of these,
[02:43:19.120 --> 02:43:22.880]   to take either of those positions is already to project out
[02:43:22.880 --> 02:43:25.320]   into that third-person view, right?
[02:43:25.320 --> 02:43:28.080]   And that third-person view we wanna really emphasize
[02:43:28.080 --> 02:43:29.720]   is a fiction.
[02:43:29.720 --> 02:43:31.960]   It's a useful fiction when you're doing science, right?
[02:43:31.960 --> 02:43:34.820]   If I wanna do like, you know, the Newtonian physics
[02:43:34.820 --> 02:43:37.800]   of billiard balls on a pool table, great.
[02:43:37.800 --> 02:43:40.120]   I don't wanna have to think about experience at all, right?
[02:43:40.120 --> 02:43:42.640]   But you know, if I'm asking deeper questions,
[02:43:42.640 --> 02:43:44.760]   I can't ignore the fact that there really is
[02:43:44.760 --> 02:43:47.920]   no third-person view, and that any story I tell
[02:43:47.920 --> 02:43:50.800]   about the world is coming from,
[02:43:50.800 --> 02:43:52.720]   it's not just first-person, but it's literally,
[02:43:52.720 --> 02:43:54.520]   'cause I'm gonna argue that experience
[02:43:54.520 --> 02:43:56.160]   always involves all of us.
[02:43:56.160 --> 02:43:58.800]   Experience always originates out of a community.
[02:43:58.800 --> 02:44:02.080]   That, you know, you're always telling those stories
[02:44:02.080 --> 02:44:05.400]   from the perspective of already existing,
[02:44:05.400 --> 02:44:07.160]   of already being in experience.
[02:44:07.160 --> 02:44:11.280]   So whatever account we wanna give of the world
[02:44:11.280 --> 02:44:13.640]   is gonna have to take that experience
[02:44:13.640 --> 02:44:16.800]   as being irreducible, and the irreducible starting point.
[02:44:16.800 --> 02:44:19.160]   So ultimately, like, we don't have an answer.
[02:44:19.160 --> 02:44:20.120]   Like, that's when people are like,
[02:44:20.120 --> 02:44:22.000]   "Well, what are you suggesting as your alternative?"
[02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:23.160]   It's like, look, that's the good work
[02:44:23.160 --> 02:44:24.400]   of the next science to come.
[02:44:24.400 --> 02:44:27.360]   Well, our job was to point out the problem with this.
[02:44:27.360 --> 02:44:28.640]   But what we would argue with is,
[02:44:28.640 --> 02:44:30.120]   and we're thinking about the next book,
[02:44:30.120 --> 02:44:31.520]   is this is really gonna require
[02:44:31.520 --> 02:44:34.080]   a new conception of nature, right?
[02:44:34.080 --> 02:44:36.680]   That doesn't sort of jump right to that third-person,
[02:44:36.680 --> 02:44:38.440]   that fictional third-person view,
[02:44:38.440 --> 02:44:40.960]   and somehow figures out how to do science,
[02:44:40.960 --> 02:44:44.200]   recognizing that it always starts from experience.
[02:44:44.200 --> 02:44:46.320]   It always starts from this field of experience,
[02:44:46.320 --> 02:44:49.440]   or in phenomenology, the word is the life world,
[02:44:49.440 --> 02:44:50.560]   that you're embedded in.
[02:44:50.560 --> 02:44:52.520]   You can't un-embed yourself from it.
[02:44:52.520 --> 02:44:55.680]   So how do you do, so one of the things
[02:44:55.680 --> 02:44:56.960]   that Whitehead said was, you know,
[02:44:56.960 --> 02:44:59.560]   we have to avoid the bifurcation of nature.
[02:44:59.560 --> 02:45:01.520]   And what he meant by that is the bifurcation
[02:45:01.520 --> 02:45:04.040]   into like sort of scientific concepts,
[02:45:04.040 --> 02:45:06.800]   wavelength, you know, think about like seeing a sunset.
[02:45:06.800 --> 02:45:08.560]   You can say like, oh, look, it's just wavelengths,
[02:45:08.560 --> 02:45:10.240]   you know, and scattering particles.
[02:45:10.240 --> 02:45:12.040]   And your experience of the redness,
[02:45:12.040 --> 02:45:13.640]   the actual experience of the redness,
[02:45:13.640 --> 02:45:15.480]   and all the other things, it's not just red,
[02:45:15.480 --> 02:45:17.600]   there's no qualia, there's no pure redness.
[02:45:17.600 --> 02:45:19.720]   Everything that's happening in the experiential part
[02:45:19.720 --> 02:45:20.880]   is just an epiphenomena.
[02:45:20.880 --> 02:45:23.200]   It's just, you know, brain states, whatever.
[02:45:23.200 --> 02:45:24.440]   He said you can't do that.
[02:45:24.440 --> 02:45:26.300]   They're just, they're both real.
[02:45:26.300 --> 02:45:29.920]   They're both accounts, they both need to be integrated.
[02:45:29.920 --> 02:45:31.680]   And so that required, I think,
[02:45:31.680 --> 02:45:34.480]   a really different conception of what we mean by nature.
[02:45:34.480 --> 02:45:39.240]   - Is it something like incorporating in the physics,
[02:45:39.240 --> 02:45:41.120]   in the study of nature, the observer,
[02:45:41.120 --> 02:45:42.480]   the experiencing observer,
[02:45:42.480 --> 02:45:45.000]   or is that still also looking from a third person?
[02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:46.920]   - I think that that's what we have to figure out, right?
[02:45:46.920 --> 02:45:48.080]   And so actually, you know, a great place
[02:45:48.080 --> 02:45:50.000]   to think about this is quantum mechanics, right?
[02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:51.480]   'Cause one of the things we're arguing is like,
[02:45:51.480 --> 02:45:55.000]   look, in the chapter that I wrote on,
[02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:56.840]   'cause it was, I wrote this with Evan Thompson,
[02:45:56.840 --> 02:45:58.240]   who's a wonderful philosopher,
[02:45:58.240 --> 02:46:00.840]   and Marcelo Gleiser, who's a theoretical physicist.
[02:46:00.840 --> 02:46:01.880]   When I was writing the chapter
[02:46:01.880 --> 02:46:03.160]   on the origin of the blind spot,
[02:46:03.160 --> 02:46:04.000]   like, you know, sort of what,
[02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:06.320]   how this emerged out of history,
[02:46:06.320 --> 02:46:07.920]   my, the subheader was like,
[02:46:07.920 --> 02:46:10.360]   well, it made sense at the time, 'cause it did.
[02:46:10.360 --> 02:46:12.360]   You know, it really, there was a reason why
[02:46:12.360 --> 02:46:14.040]   people adopted this third person,
[02:46:14.040 --> 02:46:16.440]   God's eye, deterministic view.
[02:46:16.440 --> 02:46:17.280]   This view of sort of like,
[02:46:17.280 --> 02:46:20.000]   yeah, the perfect clockwork of the universe,
[02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:21.280]   yeah, totally made sense.
[02:46:21.280 --> 02:46:22.440]   But by the time you got to the beginning
[02:46:22.440 --> 02:46:25.680]   of the 20th century, science itself was telling you like,
[02:46:25.680 --> 02:46:27.920]   eh, eh, and no place does this appear
[02:46:27.920 --> 02:46:29.760]   more than in quantum mechanics, right?
[02:46:29.760 --> 02:46:34.520]   Quantum mechanics slams you with the idea that the,
[02:46:34.520 --> 02:46:36.800]   of the measurement problem, you know?
[02:46:36.800 --> 02:46:38.480]   The most important thing about quantum mechanics
[02:46:38.480 --> 02:46:41.960]   is you have a dynamical equation, the Schrodinger equation,
[02:46:41.960 --> 02:46:42.800]   which, you know, you put in,
[02:46:42.800 --> 02:46:44.920]   like we talked about before, you have initial conditions,
[02:46:44.920 --> 02:46:46.280]   and now you've got a differential equation,
[02:46:46.280 --> 02:46:47.960]   and you crank out the differential equation,
[02:46:47.960 --> 02:46:49.880]   and it makes predictions for the future, right?
[02:46:49.880 --> 02:46:51.640]   Exactly like Newtonian physics,
[02:46:51.640 --> 02:46:55.800]   or its higher versions of Lagrange or Hamiltonians.
[02:46:55.800 --> 02:46:57.640]   But then this other thing happens where it's like,
[02:46:57.640 --> 02:47:00.400]   oh, by the way, as soon as you look at it,
[02:47:00.400 --> 02:47:02.320]   as soon as the measurement is made,
[02:47:02.320 --> 02:47:04.400]   I have a whole nother set of rules for you.
[02:47:04.400 --> 02:47:07.240]   You know, that's the Born, what we call the Born rule.
[02:47:07.240 --> 02:47:09.000]   And it was telling you right from the beginning
[02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:11.720]   that measurement matters, right?
[02:47:11.720 --> 02:47:14.560]   So when you're asking like, how will we do this?
[02:47:14.560 --> 02:47:17.120]   Quantum mechanics is actually pointing to how to do it.
[02:47:17.120 --> 02:47:18.480]   So, you know, there's been all these different
[02:47:18.480 --> 02:47:19.880]   interpretations of the quantum mechanics.
[02:47:19.880 --> 02:47:21.760]   Many of them try to pretend
[02:47:21.760 --> 02:47:23.240]   the measurement problem isn't there,
[02:47:23.240 --> 02:47:24.600]   go to enormous lengths,
[02:47:24.600 --> 02:47:27.040]   like the many worlds interpretation,
[02:47:27.040 --> 02:47:29.080]   literally inventing an infinite number
[02:47:29.080 --> 02:47:31.680]   of unobservable parallel universes
[02:47:31.680 --> 02:47:34.280]   to avoid the thing that quantum mechanics is telling them,
[02:47:34.280 --> 02:47:36.080]   which is that measurements matter.
[02:47:36.080 --> 02:47:37.600]   And then you get something like cubism,
[02:47:37.600 --> 02:47:39.240]   which is I'm gonna advocate for,
[02:47:39.240 --> 02:47:41.280]   is a new interpretation of quantum mechanics,
[02:47:41.280 --> 02:47:43.960]   which puts the Born rule at the center, right?
[02:47:43.960 --> 02:47:46.280]   Instead of like focusing on the Schrodinger equation
[02:47:46.280 --> 02:47:47.440]   and the weird things that come out of it,
[02:47:47.440 --> 02:47:49.360]   like Schrodinger's cat and all that other stuff,
[02:47:49.360 --> 02:47:51.600]   it says, no, no, actually the real mystery
[02:47:51.600 --> 02:47:54.520]   is the Born rule, let's think about the Born rule.
[02:47:54.520 --> 02:47:57.280]   And like you said, that puts the agent,
[02:47:57.280 --> 02:48:01.240]   the agent and information at the center of the whole thing.
[02:48:01.240 --> 02:48:03.360]   - So that's not a thing you're trying to get rid of,
[02:48:03.360 --> 02:48:05.120]   that's the thing you're trying to integrate
[02:48:05.120 --> 02:48:06.120]   at the center of the thing.
[02:48:06.120 --> 02:48:08.480]   And in quantum mechanics, it becomes super obvious,
[02:48:08.480 --> 02:48:12.640]   but maybe this same kind of thing
[02:48:12.640 --> 02:48:17.640]   should be incorporated in every layer of study of nature.
[02:48:17.640 --> 02:48:20.840]   - Absolutely, that's exactly it.
[02:48:20.840 --> 02:48:22.280]   So one of the things that's really interesting to me,
[02:48:22.280 --> 02:48:25.760]   so I have a project, I'm part of a big project
[02:48:25.760 --> 02:48:28.960]   that Chris Fuchs and Jacques Pannier on cubism,
[02:48:28.960 --> 02:48:29.800]   so I've been part of that.
[02:48:29.800 --> 02:48:33.040]   And what I've been amazed by is the language they use.
[02:48:33.040 --> 02:48:34.320]   So what's cool about cubism
[02:48:34.320 --> 02:48:36.040]   is it comes from quantum information theory.
[02:48:36.040 --> 02:48:37.680]   It's a pretty modern version
[02:48:37.680 --> 02:48:39.360]   of thinking about quantum mechanics.
[02:48:39.360 --> 02:48:43.440]   And it's always about, you have an agent
[02:48:43.440 --> 02:48:47.120]   who makes an action on the world,
[02:48:47.120 --> 02:48:49.600]   and then the information they get from that action
[02:48:49.600 --> 02:48:51.920]   through the experiment, that's the action in the world,
[02:48:51.920 --> 02:48:55.440]   updates their priors, updates their Bayesian,
[02:48:55.440 --> 02:48:58.400]   that's why it's called cubism, quantum Bayesianism,
[02:48:58.400 --> 02:49:01.480]   updates how the information they've gotten from the world.
[02:49:01.480 --> 02:49:04.160]   Now, this turns out to be kind of the same language
[02:49:04.160 --> 02:49:05.840]   that we're using in a project
[02:49:05.840 --> 02:49:08.460]   that's about the physics of life,
[02:49:08.460 --> 02:49:11.200]   where we have a grant from the Templeton Foundation
[02:49:11.200 --> 02:49:12.880]   to look at semantic information
[02:49:12.880 --> 02:49:15.240]   and the role of semantic information
[02:49:15.240 --> 02:49:16.760]   in living systems like cells.
[02:49:16.760 --> 02:49:18.540]   So we have Shannon information,
[02:49:18.540 --> 02:49:20.280]   which is a probability distribution
[02:49:20.280 --> 02:49:23.360]   that tells you basically how much surprise there is
[02:49:23.360 --> 02:49:24.760]   in a message.
[02:49:24.760 --> 02:49:28.060]   Semantic information focuses on meaning, right?
[02:49:28.060 --> 02:49:30.080]   Focuses on, and in a very simple way,
[02:49:30.080 --> 02:49:32.640]   just like what is, how much of the information
[02:49:32.640 --> 02:49:37.280]   that the agent, the critter, is getting from the world
[02:49:37.280 --> 02:49:40.980]   actually helps it survive, right?
[02:49:40.980 --> 02:49:42.800]   That's the most basic idea of meaning, right?
[02:49:42.800 --> 02:49:44.800]   We can get all philosophical about meaning, but this is it.
[02:49:44.800 --> 02:49:46.720]   Does it help me stay alive or not?
[02:49:46.720 --> 02:49:50.880]   And the whole question of agency and autonomy
[02:49:50.880 --> 02:49:53.520]   that occurs in this setting of just asking about
[02:49:53.520 --> 02:49:57.440]   how do cells move up a chemical gradient to get more food
[02:49:57.440 --> 02:50:01.280]   kind of has the same feel, the same sort of architecture
[02:50:01.280 --> 02:50:02.800]   as what's going on in quantum mechanics.
[02:50:02.800 --> 02:50:04.440]   So I think what you said is exactly it.
[02:50:04.440 --> 02:50:07.000]   How do we bring this sort of recognition
[02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:10.480]   that there's always us, the agent,
[02:50:10.480 --> 02:50:14.400]   or life, the agent, interacting with the world
[02:50:14.400 --> 02:50:16.160]   and drawing it, both giving information
[02:50:16.160 --> 02:50:19.960]   and passing information back as a way of doing science,
[02:50:19.960 --> 02:50:21.860]   doing hardcore science with experiments,
[02:50:21.860 --> 02:50:23.880]   but never forgetting that agency,
[02:50:23.880 --> 02:50:25.880]   which also means experience in some sense,
[02:50:25.880 --> 02:50:27.300]   is at the center of the whole thing.
[02:50:27.300 --> 02:50:30.160]   - So you think there could be something like cubism,
[02:50:30.160 --> 02:50:35.160]   quantum Bayesianism, that creates a theory
[02:50:35.160 --> 02:50:37.000]   like a Nobel Prize winning theory,
[02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:40.960]   sort of like hardcore real theories
[02:50:40.960 --> 02:50:42.960]   that put the agent at the center.
[02:50:42.960 --> 02:50:44.400]   - Yes, that's what we're looking for.
[02:50:44.400 --> 02:50:46.680]   I think that is really, that's the exciting part.
[02:50:46.680 --> 02:50:47.520]   And it's a move, you know,
[02:50:47.520 --> 02:50:49.440]   the scientific triumphalist thing says,
[02:50:49.440 --> 02:50:52.360]   you know, we understand why people love this.
[02:50:52.360 --> 02:50:55.360]   Like I have these equations and these equations represent,
[02:50:55.360 --> 02:50:57.800]   you know, there's this platonic ideal that they are,
[02:50:57.800 --> 02:51:00.880]   you know, they exist eternally on their own.
[02:51:00.880 --> 02:51:02.480]   It's kind of quasi-religious, right?
[02:51:02.480 --> 02:51:03.880]   It's sort of like somehow look,
[02:51:03.880 --> 02:51:07.020]   these equations are the, you're reading the mind of God.
[02:51:07.020 --> 02:51:09.720]   But this other approach to me is just as exciting
[02:51:09.720 --> 02:51:12.520]   because what you're saying is there's us and the world,
[02:51:12.520 --> 02:51:14.080]   they're inseparable, right?
[02:51:14.080 --> 02:51:15.800]   It's always us and the world.
[02:51:15.800 --> 02:51:17.080]   And what we're now finding about
[02:51:17.080 --> 02:51:20.720]   is this kind of co-creation, this interaction,
[02:51:20.720 --> 02:51:23.400]   you know, between the agent and the world,
[02:51:23.400 --> 02:51:26.600]   such that these powerful laws of physics
[02:51:26.600 --> 02:51:28.280]   that need an account, like in no way am I saying
[02:51:28.280 --> 02:51:30.520]   these laws aren't important, these laws are amazing,
[02:51:30.520 --> 02:51:34.680]   but they need an account, but not an account that strips,
[02:51:34.680 --> 02:51:36.760]   you know, that turns the experience,
[02:51:36.760 --> 02:51:40.640]   turns the agent into just a, you know, an epiphenomenon,
[02:51:40.640 --> 02:51:42.800]   that it pushes the agent out and makes it seem
[02:51:42.800 --> 02:51:45.480]   as if the agent's not the most important part of the story.
[02:51:45.480 --> 02:51:47.080]   - So if you pull on this thread
[02:51:47.080 --> 02:51:50.840]   and say there's a whole discipline born of this,
[02:51:50.840 --> 02:51:54.160]   putting the agent as the primary thing in a theory,
[02:51:54.160 --> 02:51:57.760]   in a physics theory, like how, is it possible
[02:51:57.760 --> 02:52:00.280]   it just like breaks the whole thing open?
[02:52:00.280 --> 02:52:03.380]   So there's this whole effort of, you know,
[02:52:03.380 --> 02:52:05.840]   unifying general relativity and quantum mechanics
[02:52:05.840 --> 02:52:08.080]   of like coming up with a theory of everything.
[02:52:08.080 --> 02:52:13.080]   What if these are like the tip of the iceberg?
[02:52:13.080 --> 02:52:18.760]   What if the agent thing is like really important?
[02:52:18.760 --> 02:52:22.480]   - So, you know, listen, that would be like kind of my dream.
[02:52:22.480 --> 02:52:23.680]   I'm not gonna be the one to do it
[02:52:23.680 --> 02:52:25.560]   because I'm not smart enough to do it.
[02:52:25.560 --> 02:52:27.440]   But, you know, Marcello and I have for a while
[02:52:27.440 --> 02:52:30.760]   have been sort of critical of where foundational physics
[02:52:30.760 --> 02:52:32.680]   has been for a while with string theory.
[02:52:32.680 --> 02:52:34.920]   I've spent my whole life listening to talks
[02:52:34.920 --> 02:52:37.460]   about string theory real soon, you know,
[02:52:37.460 --> 02:52:42.080]   and it's gotten ever more disconnected
[02:52:42.080 --> 02:52:45.360]   from, you know, data observations.
[02:52:45.360 --> 02:52:46.480]   There were people talking for a while
[02:52:46.480 --> 02:52:50.400]   that it's post-empirical, and I always wanted to write
[02:52:50.400 --> 02:52:52.720]   a paper or an article that was like,
[02:52:52.720 --> 02:52:55.320]   physicists have been smoking their own stash, right?
[02:52:55.320 --> 02:52:56.760]   There's this way we've gotten used to like, you know,
[02:52:56.760 --> 02:52:58.960]   you have to outweird the other person.
[02:52:58.960 --> 02:53:01.160]   We're like, my theory is 38 dimensions.
[02:53:01.160 --> 02:53:03.760]   My theory is 22 dimensions, but it's got, you know,
[02:53:03.760 --> 02:53:07.360]   psychedelic squirrels in it.
[02:53:07.360 --> 02:53:08.880]   And so there's been a problem, there's a problem.
[02:53:08.880 --> 02:53:11.840]   Now, I don't need to tell you there's a crisis in physics
[02:53:11.840 --> 02:53:13.240]   or there's a crisis in cosmology.
[02:53:13.240 --> 02:53:14.440]   Other people have used that.
[02:53:14.440 --> 02:53:18.080]   That's been the headline on scientific American stories.
[02:53:18.080 --> 02:53:20.760]   So there clearly another direction has to be found,
[02:53:20.760 --> 02:53:22.600]   and maybe it has nothing to do with this,
[02:53:22.600 --> 02:53:27.600]   but I suspect that because so many times the agent
[02:53:27.600 --> 02:53:33.400]   or the having to deal with the view from the inside
[02:53:33.400 --> 02:53:36.920]   or the role of agency, like when it comes to time,
[02:53:36.920 --> 02:53:40.260]   thinking that you can replace the block universe
[02:53:40.260 --> 02:53:43.480]   with the actual experience of time, you know,
[02:53:43.480 --> 02:53:46.840]   clocks don't tell time, we use clocks to tell time.
[02:53:46.840 --> 02:53:48.960]   So it may be that even like the fundamental nature of time
[02:53:48.960 --> 02:53:50.720]   can't be viewed from the outside,
[02:53:50.720 --> 02:53:54.120]   that there's a new physics theory that is gonna come from,
[02:53:54.120 --> 02:53:56.160]   that comes from this agential,
[02:53:56.160 --> 02:53:59.380]   informational, computational view.
[02:53:59.380 --> 02:54:01.880]   I don't know, but that's kind of what I think
[02:54:01.880 --> 02:54:05.760]   it would be fertile ground to explore.
[02:54:05.760 --> 02:54:08.320]   - Yeah, time is a really interesting one.
[02:54:08.320 --> 02:54:10.980]   This time is really important to us humans.
[02:54:10.980 --> 02:54:12.160]   What is time?
[02:54:12.160 --> 02:54:14.080]   - Yeah, that's right, what is time?
[02:54:14.080 --> 02:54:16.740]   So the way we have tended to view it is we've taken,
[02:54:16.740 --> 02:54:18.120]   this is what when Herschel talks about
[02:54:18.120 --> 02:54:20.400]   the surreptitious substitution,
[02:54:20.400 --> 02:54:23.800]   we've taken Einstein's beautiful, powerful,
[02:54:23.800 --> 02:54:27.360]   formal system for viewing time,
[02:54:27.360 --> 02:54:30.120]   and we substituted that
[02:54:30.120 --> 02:54:33.080]   for the actual experience of time, right?
[02:54:33.080 --> 02:54:34.040]   So the block universe,
[02:54:34.040 --> 02:54:36.280]   where like next Tuesday is already written down,
[02:54:36.280 --> 02:54:37.640]   you know, in the block universe,
[02:54:37.640 --> 02:54:38.600]   the four dimensional universe,
[02:54:38.600 --> 02:54:40.400]   all events are already there,
[02:54:40.400 --> 02:54:42.120]   which is very potent for making
[02:54:42.120 --> 02:54:44.300]   certain kinds of predictions within the sort of,
[02:54:44.300 --> 02:54:46.240]   you know, the scientific framework.
[02:54:46.240 --> 02:54:49.920]   But, you know, it is not lived time.
[02:54:49.920 --> 02:54:52.240]   And, you know, this was pointed out to Einstein,
[02:54:52.240 --> 02:54:54.180]   and he eventually recognized it.
[02:54:54.180 --> 02:54:56.920]   Very famous meeting between Henri Bergson,
[02:54:56.920 --> 02:54:59.160]   who was the most famous philosopher of like the,
[02:54:59.160 --> 02:55:02.280]   you know, early 20th century, and Einstein,
[02:55:02.280 --> 02:55:04.440]   where Einstein was giving a talk on relativity,
[02:55:04.440 --> 02:55:06.560]   and Bergson, whose whole thing was about time
[02:55:06.560 --> 02:55:07.720]   and was about duration.
[02:55:07.720 --> 02:55:12.120]   He wanted to separate the scientific image of time,
[02:55:12.120 --> 02:55:15.940]   the map of time, from the actual terrain,
[02:55:15.940 --> 02:55:17.600]   which he used the word duration.
[02:55:17.600 --> 02:55:21.320]   Like we humans, where duration for us is full,
[02:55:21.320 --> 02:55:23.320]   it's sort of, it's stretched out.
[02:55:23.320 --> 02:55:24.440]   It's got a little bit of the past,
[02:55:24.440 --> 02:55:25.860]   a little bit of the future, a little bit of the present.
[02:55:25.860 --> 02:55:27.560]   Music is the best example, right?
[02:55:27.560 --> 02:55:28.640]   You're hearing music,
[02:55:28.640 --> 02:55:31.140]   you're both already anticipating what's gonna happen,
[02:55:31.140 --> 02:55:34.800]   and you're, you know, remembering what's going on.
[02:55:34.800 --> 02:55:38.320]   There's a kind of phenomenal structure there,
[02:55:38.320 --> 02:55:41.860]   which is different from the representation of time
[02:55:41.860 --> 02:55:43.940]   that you have with the formal mathematics.
[02:55:43.940 --> 02:55:46.880]   And what, you know, the way we would look at this
[02:55:46.880 --> 02:55:49.360]   is that the problem with the surreptitious substitution,
[02:55:49.360 --> 02:55:50.920]   the problem with the blind spot,
[02:55:50.920 --> 02:55:54.200]   is it says, oh, no, no, the formal system is time.
[02:55:54.200 --> 02:55:57.200]   But really the only place time appears is with us, right?
[02:55:57.200 --> 02:55:58.440]   Where we're time, you know.
[02:55:58.440 --> 02:56:01.920]   So having a theory that actually could start with us,
[02:56:01.920 --> 02:56:03.880]   you know, and then stretch out into the universe,
[02:56:03.880 --> 02:56:07.560]   rather than imposing this imaginary third-person view
[02:56:07.560 --> 02:56:10.040]   back on us, you know, could,
[02:56:10.040 --> 02:56:12.640]   that's a route towards a different way
[02:56:12.640 --> 02:56:13.600]   of approaching the whole problem.
[02:56:13.600 --> 02:56:15.040]   - I just wonder, who is the observer?
[02:56:15.040 --> 02:56:16.860]   I mean, defying what the agent is.
[02:56:16.860 --> 02:56:17.700]   - Right.
[02:56:17.700 --> 02:56:20.600]   - In any kind of frame is difficult.
[02:56:20.600 --> 02:56:21.520]   - Is difficult, right?
[02:56:21.520 --> 02:56:22.840]   And so that, but that's the good work
[02:56:22.840 --> 02:56:24.640]   of the science ahead of us, right?
[02:56:24.640 --> 02:56:25.640]   So what happened with this idea
[02:56:25.640 --> 02:56:27.480]   of the structural invariance I was talking about?
[02:56:27.480 --> 02:56:28.840]   So, you know, we start with experience,
[02:56:28.840 --> 02:56:29.760]   which is irreducible.
[02:56:29.760 --> 02:56:31.560]   There's no atoms of experience, right?
[02:56:31.560 --> 02:56:33.120]   It's a whole.
[02:56:33.120 --> 02:56:34.360]   And we go through the whole process,
[02:56:34.360 --> 02:56:35.880]   which is a communal process, by the way.
[02:56:35.880 --> 02:56:37.200]   There's a philosopher, Robert Crease,
[02:56:37.200 --> 02:56:38.840]   who talks about the workshop.
[02:56:38.840 --> 02:56:41.260]   That starting in like the 1700s, 1600s,
[02:56:41.260 --> 02:56:45.540]   we developed this communal space to work in.
[02:56:45.540 --> 02:56:48.200]   Sometimes it was literally a physical space, a laboratory,
[02:56:48.200 --> 02:56:50.800]   where these ideas would be pulled apart, refined,
[02:56:50.800 --> 02:56:53.000]   argued over, and then validated,
[02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:54.780]   and we went to the next step.
[02:56:54.780 --> 02:56:57.360]   So this idea of pulling out from experience,
[02:56:57.360 --> 02:57:01.500]   these thinner, abstract, structural invariance,
[02:57:01.500 --> 02:57:03.640]   the things that we could actually do science with.
[02:57:03.640 --> 02:57:04.480]   And it's kind of like,
[02:57:04.480 --> 02:57:07.580]   we call it an ascending spiral of abstraction, right?
[02:57:07.580 --> 02:57:10.180]   So the problem with the way we do things now
[02:57:10.180 --> 02:57:14.060]   is we take that, those abstractions,
[02:57:14.060 --> 02:57:15.380]   which came from experience,
[02:57:15.380 --> 02:57:16.660]   and then with something like, you know,
[02:57:16.660 --> 02:57:21.420]   a computational model of consciousness or experience,
[02:57:21.420 --> 02:57:22.860]   we think we can put it back in.
[02:57:22.860 --> 02:57:25.740]   Like you literally pulled out these super thin things,
[02:57:25.740 --> 02:57:29.180]   these abstractions, you know, neglecting experience,
[02:57:29.180 --> 02:57:30.780]   because that's the only way to do science.
[02:57:30.780 --> 02:57:31.620]   And then you think somehow,
[02:57:31.620 --> 02:57:33.940]   oh, I'm gonna put, I'm gonna jam experience back in,
[02:57:33.940 --> 02:57:36.780]   and, you know, have an explanation for experience.
[02:57:36.780 --> 02:57:38.180]   - So do you think it's possible to show
[02:57:38.180 --> 02:57:41.900]   that something like free will is quote-unquote real,
[02:57:41.900 --> 02:57:44.500]   if you integrate experience back into this physics,
[02:57:44.500 --> 02:57:46.140]   into the physics model of the world?
[02:57:46.140 --> 02:57:49.580]   - What I would say is that free will is a given,
[02:57:49.580 --> 02:57:50.840]   and that's the thing about experience, right?
[02:57:50.840 --> 02:57:52.760]   So one of the things that Whitehead said,
[02:57:52.760 --> 02:57:53.600]   I really love this quote,
[02:57:53.600 --> 02:57:57.020]   he says, "It's not the job of either science or philosophy
[02:57:57.020 --> 02:57:59.180]   to account for the concrete.
[02:57:59.180 --> 02:58:01.660]   It's the job to account for the abstract."
[02:58:01.660 --> 02:58:05.420]   The concrete, what's happening between us right now,
[02:58:05.420 --> 02:58:08.820]   is just given, you know, it's just, it's presented to us.
[02:58:08.820 --> 02:58:10.660]   Every day, it's presented to me.
[02:58:10.660 --> 02:58:11.940]   If you want an explanation, fine,
[02:58:11.940 --> 02:58:14.480]   but the explanation actually doesn't add anything to it.
[02:58:14.480 --> 02:58:15.320]   Right?
[02:58:15.320 --> 02:58:16.660]   So that free will, in some sense,
[02:58:16.660 --> 02:58:18.200]   is the nature of being an agent, right?
[02:58:18.200 --> 02:58:20.700]   To be an agent, agency and autonomy
[02:58:20.700 --> 02:58:23.140]   are sort of the two things that are, you know,
[02:58:23.140 --> 02:58:24.220]   they're equivalent.
[02:58:24.220 --> 02:58:27.260]   And so in some sense, to be an agent is to be autonomous.
[02:58:27.260 --> 02:58:29.220]   And so then the question really to ask is,
[02:58:29.220 --> 02:58:32.980]   can you have an account for agency and autonomy
[02:58:32.980 --> 02:58:37.980]   that captures aspects of its arising in the world,
[02:58:37.980 --> 02:58:41.640]   or the way it and the world sort of co-arise?
[02:58:41.640 --> 02:58:42.480]   But the idea, you know,
[02:58:42.480 --> 02:58:44.100]   the reason why we argue about free will often
[02:58:44.100 --> 02:58:46.320]   is because we already have this blind spot view
[02:58:46.320 --> 02:58:49.300]   that the world is deterministic because of our equations,
[02:58:49.300 --> 02:58:51.240]   which themselves, we treat the equations
[02:58:51.240 --> 02:58:53.820]   as if they're more real than experience.
[02:58:53.820 --> 02:58:56.820]   You know, and the equations are a paler, you know,
[02:58:56.820 --> 02:58:58.380]   they don't corral experience.
[02:58:58.380 --> 02:59:00.800]   They are a thinner, you know, representation.
[02:59:00.800 --> 02:59:04.620]   As we like to say, don't confuse the map for the terrain.
[02:59:04.620 --> 02:59:06.780]   What's happening between us right now in this, you know,
[02:59:06.780 --> 02:59:09.100]   all the weirdness of it, that's the terrain.
[02:59:09.100 --> 02:59:11.020]   The map is what I can write down on equations
[02:59:11.020 --> 02:59:13.420]   and then in the workshop do experiments on.
[02:59:13.420 --> 02:59:15.480]   Super powerful, needs an account,
[02:59:15.480 --> 02:59:17.880]   but experience overflows that.
[02:59:17.880 --> 02:59:19.980]   - What if the experience is an illusion?
[02:59:19.980 --> 02:59:21.940]   Like, how do we know?
[02:59:21.940 --> 02:59:26.100]   What if the agency that we experience is an illusion?
[02:59:26.100 --> 02:59:28.580]   - An illusion, looking from where?
[02:59:28.580 --> 02:59:30.020]   Like, right, 'cause that already requires,
[02:59:30.020 --> 02:59:32.460]   to take that stance, is you've already pushed yourself
[02:59:32.460 --> 02:59:34.460]   into that third-person view, right?
[02:59:34.460 --> 02:59:37.340]   And so what we're saying is that third-person view,
[02:59:37.340 --> 02:59:38.180]   which now you're gonna say like,
[02:59:38.180 --> 02:59:40.900]   oh, I've got a whole other set of entities,
[02:59:40.900 --> 02:59:42.860]   of ontological entities, meaning, you know,
[02:59:42.860 --> 02:59:46.340]   things that I think exist in God's living room
[02:59:46.340 --> 02:59:49.260]   in spite, you know, that are independent of me
[02:59:49.260 --> 02:59:51.860]   and the community of living things I'm part of.
[02:59:51.860 --> 02:59:53.900]   - So you're pushing it elsewhere.
[02:59:53.900 --> 02:59:55.340]   Just like there's a stack of turtles,
[02:59:55.340 --> 02:59:59.060]   it's probably, if this experience,
[02:59:59.060 --> 03:00:00.780]   the human experience is an illusion,
[03:00:00.780 --> 03:00:04.140]   maybe there's an observer for whom it's not an illusion,
[03:00:04.140 --> 03:00:06.180]   so you always have to find an observer somewhere.
[03:00:06.180 --> 03:00:07.700]   - Yeah, right, and that's why, you know,
[03:00:07.700 --> 03:00:09.620]   fundamentally the blind spot,
[03:00:09.620 --> 03:00:11.740]   especially the scientific triumphalist part,
[03:00:11.740 --> 03:00:14.460]   is following a religious impulse, you know?
[03:00:14.460 --> 03:00:16.620]   It's wanting the God's eye view.
[03:00:16.620 --> 03:00:17.620]   And you know what's really interesting?
[03:00:17.620 --> 03:00:18.540]   And when we think about this
[03:00:18.540 --> 03:00:21.020]   and the way this gets talked about, especially publicly,
[03:00:21.020 --> 03:00:24.300]   you know, there's a line of philosophical inquiry
[03:00:24.300 --> 03:00:26.700]   that this language gets couched in,
[03:00:26.700 --> 03:00:29.020]   and it is actually a pretty,
[03:00:29.020 --> 03:00:32.620]   it's only one version of philosophy, right?
[03:00:32.620 --> 03:00:33.500]   So it is pretty much
[03:00:33.500 --> 03:00:35.980]   what we call the analytic tradition, right?
[03:00:35.980 --> 03:00:38.900]   But there's, even in Europe, or in the Western tradition,
[03:00:38.900 --> 03:00:40.140]   and you know, for Western,
[03:00:40.140 --> 03:00:41.460]   what we'll call Western philosophy,
[03:00:41.460 --> 03:00:42.580]   there's phenomenology.
[03:00:42.580 --> 03:00:45.020]   There's Herzog and Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty,
[03:00:45.020 --> 03:00:46.700]   which took an entirely different track.
[03:00:46.700 --> 03:00:49.300]   They were really interested in the structure of experience.
[03:00:49.300 --> 03:00:51.740]   They spent all their time trying to understand,
[03:00:51.740 --> 03:00:53.260]   trying to develop a language
[03:00:53.300 --> 03:00:55.580]   that could kind of climb into the circle
[03:00:55.580 --> 03:00:57.260]   that is experience, right?
[03:00:57.260 --> 03:00:59.180]   Experience, you're not gonna be able to start with axioms
[03:00:59.180 --> 03:01:00.100]   and work your way to it.
[03:01:00.100 --> 03:01:02.540]   It's given, so you have to kind of jump in
[03:01:02.540 --> 03:01:03.780]   and then try and find a language
[03:01:03.780 --> 03:01:05.900]   to account for its structure.
[03:01:05.900 --> 03:01:09.020]   But then, so that has not been part of this discussion
[03:01:09.020 --> 03:01:12.860]   about you'll never, good luck finding a YouTube video
[03:01:12.860 --> 03:01:14.900]   where someone, you know, a famous scientist
[03:01:14.900 --> 03:01:16.820]   is talking about science
[03:01:16.820 --> 03:01:18.300]   from a phenomenological point of view,
[03:01:18.300 --> 03:01:20.780]   even though it's a huge branch of philosophy.
[03:01:20.780 --> 03:01:22.580]   And then you get the philosophies
[03:01:22.580 --> 03:01:25.220]   that occurred from other cores of civilization, right?
[03:01:25.220 --> 03:01:27.580]   So there's the Western core,
[03:01:27.580 --> 03:01:29.380]   out of which comes the Greeks and the, you know,
[03:01:29.380 --> 03:01:31.700]   the Judeo-Christian Islamic tradition.
[03:01:31.700 --> 03:01:34.180]   But then you get India and you get Asia
[03:01:34.180 --> 03:01:35.140]   and they developed their own.
[03:01:35.140 --> 03:01:36.860]   They were highly complex societies
[03:01:36.860 --> 03:01:39.940]   that developed their own responses to these questions.
[03:01:39.940 --> 03:01:41.580]   And they, for reasons,
[03:01:41.580 --> 03:01:43.420]   'cause they had contemplative practice,
[03:01:43.420 --> 03:01:45.340]   they were very focused on like direct,
[03:01:45.340 --> 03:01:49.220]   trying to like directly probe attention and experience.
[03:01:49.220 --> 03:01:52.820]   They asked questions in ways that the West never really did.
[03:01:52.820 --> 03:01:54.340]   Phenomenology kind of started it,
[03:01:54.340 --> 03:01:57.740]   but you know, there's philosophers like Nagarjuna
[03:01:57.740 --> 03:01:59.900]   and Vasubandhu, and they were like the Plato
[03:01:59.900 --> 03:02:02.220]   and the, you know, Aristotle of, you know,
[03:02:02.220 --> 03:02:04.100]   sort of those philosophies.
[03:02:04.100 --> 03:02:06.060]   And they were really focused on experience.
[03:02:06.060 --> 03:02:08.140]   In the West, I think maybe because we had
[03:02:08.140 --> 03:02:11.240]   the Judeo-Christian tradition,
[03:02:11.240 --> 03:02:12.720]   where we already had this kind of God
[03:02:12.720 --> 03:02:13.940]   who was gonna be the frame
[03:02:13.940 --> 03:02:16.100]   on which you could always point to that frame.
[03:02:16.100 --> 03:02:18.740]   In the traditions that came from
[03:02:18.740 --> 03:02:22.060]   the classical philosophies of India and Asia,
[03:02:22.060 --> 03:02:23.220]   they started always with,
[03:02:23.220 --> 03:02:24.700]   they wanted to know about experience.
[03:02:24.700 --> 03:02:26.740]   Their whole philosophies and their logic
[03:02:26.740 --> 03:02:29.740]   and their argumentation was based on,
[03:02:29.740 --> 03:02:31.060]   I've got this experience.
[03:02:31.060 --> 03:02:32.920]   I can't get out of this experience.
[03:02:32.920 --> 03:02:34.780]   How do I reason from it?
[03:02:34.780 --> 03:02:35.980]   So I think there's like a lot of other
[03:02:35.980 --> 03:02:38.380]   philosophical traditions that we could draw from.
[03:02:38.380 --> 03:02:39.580]   You know, not like slavishly,
[03:02:39.580 --> 03:02:41.380]   we don't all have to become Buddhists to do it,
[03:02:41.380 --> 03:02:44.300]   but there are traditions that really tried to work this out
[03:02:44.300 --> 03:02:47.060]   in a way that the Western traditions just didn't.
[03:02:47.060 --> 03:02:49.100]   - But there's also the practical fact
[03:02:49.100 --> 03:02:52.460]   that it's difficult to build a logical system
[03:02:52.460 --> 03:02:53.820]   on top of experience.
[03:02:53.820 --> 03:02:56.020]   It's difficult to have the rigor of science
[03:02:56.020 --> 03:02:57.340]   on top of experience.
[03:02:57.340 --> 03:03:00.380]   And so it's, as science advances,
[03:03:00.380 --> 03:03:01.340]   we might get better and better.
[03:03:01.340 --> 03:03:02.940]   Like the same as it's very difficult
[03:03:02.940 --> 03:03:05.100]   to have any kind of mathematical
[03:03:05.100 --> 03:03:07.340]   or kind of scientific rigor to,
[03:03:07.340 --> 03:03:12.820]   why complexity emerges from simple rules
[03:03:12.820 --> 03:03:15.660]   and simple objects, sort of the Santa Fe questions.
[03:03:15.660 --> 03:03:17.020]   - Yeah, but I think we can do it.
[03:03:17.020 --> 03:03:18.460]   I think there's aspects of it.
[03:03:18.460 --> 03:03:20.220]   I mean, as long as you're never trying to like,
[03:03:20.220 --> 03:03:21.660]   this is what experience is.
[03:03:21.660 --> 03:03:22.740]   Like, I think that's kind of the where we're,
[03:03:22.740 --> 03:03:26.740]   you know, you're never gonna have a causal account
[03:03:26.740 --> 03:03:28.380]   of experience 'cause it's just given,
[03:03:28.380 --> 03:03:30.180]   but you can do lots about,
[03:03:30.180 --> 03:03:31.740]   and that's what the good work is,
[03:03:31.740 --> 03:03:33.300]   is to how do I approach this?
[03:03:33.300 --> 03:03:34.660]   How do I approach this in a way that's rigorous
[03:03:34.660 --> 03:03:37.100]   that I can do experiments with also?
[03:03:37.100 --> 03:03:37.940]   But so for example,
[03:03:37.940 --> 03:03:39.180]   I was just reading this beautiful paper
[03:03:39.180 --> 03:03:41.900]   that was talking about in the, you know,
[03:03:41.900 --> 03:03:42.740]   this is what we're accounting
[03:03:42.740 --> 03:03:46.220]   with our semantic information too, causal closure.
[03:03:46.220 --> 03:03:47.820]   Love this idea, right?
[03:03:47.820 --> 03:03:49.740]   The idea that, so we've talked about autopoiesis
[03:03:49.740 --> 03:03:50.580]   a while back, right?
[03:03:50.580 --> 03:03:54.100]   The idea that living systems are,
[03:03:54.100 --> 03:03:57.300]   they are self-creating and self-maintaining.
[03:03:57.300 --> 03:03:58.740]   So the membrane, cell membrane
[03:03:58.740 --> 03:03:59.820]   is a great example of this, right?
[03:03:59.820 --> 03:04:01.820]   The cell membrane, you can't have a cell
[03:04:01.820 --> 03:04:02.900]   without a cell membrane.
[03:04:02.900 --> 03:04:05.540]   The cell membrane lets stuff through,
[03:04:05.540 --> 03:04:07.420]   keeps other stuff out, right?
[03:04:07.420 --> 03:04:10.220]   But the cell membrane is part of the processes
[03:04:10.220 --> 03:04:13.700]   and it's a product of the processes
[03:04:13.700 --> 03:04:16.580]   that the cell membrane needs, right?
[03:04:16.580 --> 03:04:20.180]   In some sense, the cell membrane creates itself.
[03:04:20.180 --> 03:04:22.100]   So there's this strange, it's always with life.
[03:04:22.100 --> 03:04:24.100]   There's always this strange loop.
[03:04:24.100 --> 03:04:25.660]   And so somehow figuring out how to jump
[03:04:25.660 --> 03:04:28.180]   into that strange loop is, you know,
[03:04:28.180 --> 03:04:29.220]   the science that's ahead of us.
[03:04:29.220 --> 03:04:31.220]   And so this idea of causal closure,
[03:04:31.220 --> 03:04:33.940]   accounting for how the, you know,
[03:04:33.940 --> 03:04:37.940]   we talk about like downward causation, right?
[03:04:37.940 --> 03:04:40.060]   So reductionism says everything only depends
[03:04:40.060 --> 03:04:40.820]   on the microstate.
[03:04:40.820 --> 03:04:42.460]   Everything just depends on the atoms, right?
[03:04:42.460 --> 03:04:43.300]   That's it.
[03:04:43.300 --> 03:04:46.060]   If you know the Lagrangian for the standard model,
[03:04:46.060 --> 03:04:47.340]   you're done, you know.
[03:04:47.340 --> 03:04:49.420]   Of course, in principle, you need God's computer,
[03:04:49.420 --> 03:04:53.100]   but fine, you know, in principle, it can be done.
[03:04:53.100 --> 03:04:54.260]   Causal closure, and there's,
[03:04:54.260 --> 03:04:55.740]   I was just reading this great paper
[03:04:55.740 --> 03:04:57.780]   that sort of argues for this.
[03:04:57.780 --> 03:05:00.060]   There's ways in which using Epsilon machines
[03:05:00.060 --> 03:05:02.540]   and all this machinery from information theory
[03:05:02.540 --> 03:05:06.100]   that you can see ways in which the system
[03:05:06.100 --> 03:05:08.740]   can organize itself so that it decouples
[03:05:08.740 --> 03:05:10.060]   from the microstates.
[03:05:10.060 --> 03:05:13.460]   Now the macrostate fundamentally no longer needs
[03:05:13.460 --> 03:05:15.340]   the microstate for its own description,
[03:05:15.340 --> 03:05:17.020]   its own account of the laws.
[03:05:17.020 --> 03:05:18.540]   Whether that paper is true or not,
[03:05:18.540 --> 03:05:20.860]   it's an example of heading down that road.
[03:05:20.860 --> 03:05:22.460]   There's also Robert Rosen's work.
[03:05:22.460 --> 03:05:25.220]   He was a theoretical biologist who he was, you know,
[03:05:25.220 --> 03:05:27.500]   he talked about closure to efficient cause
[03:05:27.500 --> 03:05:31.460]   that living systems, you know, are organizationally closed,
[03:05:31.460 --> 03:05:34.980]   are causally closed so that they don't depend anymore
[03:05:34.980 --> 03:05:35.820]   in the microstate.
[03:05:35.820 --> 03:05:37.100]   And he made the, he had a proof,
[03:05:37.100 --> 03:05:38.100]   which is very contentious.
[03:05:38.100 --> 03:05:39.140]   Nobody knows if it's, you know,
[03:05:39.140 --> 03:05:41.100]   some argue it's true, some argue it's not.
[03:05:41.100 --> 03:05:43.420]   But he said that because of this,
[03:05:43.420 --> 03:05:46.980]   living systems are not Church-Turing complete.
[03:05:46.980 --> 03:05:50.100]   They cannot be represented as formal systems.
[03:05:50.100 --> 03:05:52.060]   So, you know, in that way, they're not axioms.
[03:05:52.060 --> 03:05:55.140]   They're not, living systems will not be axioms.
[03:05:55.140 --> 03:05:58.100]   They can only be partially captured by algorithms.
[03:05:58.100 --> 03:05:59.940]   Now, again, people fight back and forth
[03:05:59.940 --> 03:06:02.540]   about whether or not his proof is valid or not.
[03:06:02.540 --> 03:06:04.820]   But I'm saying, I'm giving you examples of like,
[03:06:04.820 --> 03:06:08.060]   you know, when you see the blind spot,
[03:06:08.060 --> 03:06:09.420]   when you acknowledge the blind spot,
[03:06:09.420 --> 03:06:10.860]   it opens up a whole other class
[03:06:10.860 --> 03:06:13.380]   of kinds of scientific investigations.
[03:06:13.380 --> 03:06:14.460]   You know, the book we thought
[03:06:14.460 --> 03:06:16.100]   was going to be really heretical, right?
[03:06:16.100 --> 03:06:17.700]   You know, obviously, you know,
[03:06:17.700 --> 03:06:21.380]   most public facing scientists are very sort of in that,
[03:06:21.380 --> 03:06:22.580]   especially scientific triumphalism.
[03:06:22.580 --> 03:06:23.980]   So we were just like waiting, you know,
[03:06:23.980 --> 03:06:25.100]   waiting for the fight.
[03:06:25.100 --> 03:06:27.180]   And then the review from science came out
[03:06:27.180 --> 03:06:30.540]   and it was like totally pro, you know,
[03:06:30.540 --> 03:06:31.780]   they was very positive.
[03:06:31.780 --> 03:06:33.820]   We're like, oh my God, you know?
[03:06:33.820 --> 03:06:35.980]   And then a review came out in nature physics
[03:06:35.980 --> 03:06:37.780]   and it was totally positive.
[03:06:37.780 --> 03:06:39.980]   And then a review came out in the Wall Street Journal,
[03:06:39.980 --> 03:06:42.660]   'cause we kind of criticized, not capitalism,
[03:06:42.660 --> 03:06:45.260]   but we criticized sort of all industrial economies
[03:06:45.260 --> 03:06:47.180]   for that they were sort of had been touched
[03:06:47.180 --> 03:06:49.780]   by the blind spot, socialism, communism, doesn't matter.
[03:06:49.780 --> 03:06:51.500]   These extractive, you know,
[03:06:51.500 --> 03:06:52.700]   had sort of had that sort of view
[03:06:52.700 --> 03:06:56.620]   that the world is just reducible to, you know, resources.
[03:06:56.620 --> 03:06:59.420]   The Wall Street Journal gave us a great review.
[03:06:59.420 --> 03:07:01.860]   So it feels like there's actually out there,
[03:07:01.860 --> 03:07:04.740]   there is some, among working scientists in particular,
[03:07:04.740 --> 03:07:07.860]   there is some dissatisfaction with this triumphalist view
[03:07:07.860 --> 03:07:10.900]   and a recognition that we need to shift something
[03:07:10.900 --> 03:07:13.500]   in order to like jump past these hurdles
[03:07:13.500 --> 03:07:15.860]   that we've been arguing about forever.
[03:07:15.860 --> 03:07:18.140]   And we're not, you know, we're sort of stuck in a vortex.
[03:07:18.140 --> 03:07:18.980]   - Well, it is.
[03:07:18.980 --> 03:07:20.780]   I mean, I think there is a hunger to acknowledge
[03:07:20.780 --> 03:07:22.020]   that there's an elephant in the room,
[03:07:22.020 --> 03:07:25.020]   like that we're just removing the agent.
[03:07:25.020 --> 03:07:28.180]   Like it's, everyone is doing it and it's like, yeah, yeah.
[03:07:28.180 --> 03:07:30.980]   There's the experience
[03:07:30.980 --> 03:07:35.140]   and then there's the third person perspective on the world.
[03:07:35.140 --> 03:07:38.000]   And so to, man, science from a,
[03:07:38.000 --> 03:07:41.580]   applying scientific rigor from a first person perspective
[03:07:41.580 --> 03:07:42.580]   is very difficult.
[03:07:42.580 --> 03:07:44.220]   I mean, it's fascinating.
[03:07:44.220 --> 03:07:46.100]   - I think we can do it 'cause it's also the thing,
[03:07:46.100 --> 03:07:47.340]   you know, what's really interesting is this,
[03:07:47.340 --> 03:07:49.460]   I think it's not just first person,
[03:07:49.460 --> 03:07:51.220]   it's first and second, right?
[03:07:51.220 --> 03:07:54.540]   Because science, 'cause when, so like one idea is that,
[03:07:54.540 --> 03:07:55.940]   we, you know, the idea that,
[03:07:55.940 --> 03:07:58.540]   oh, science gives us this objective third person view.
[03:07:58.540 --> 03:08:00.420]   That's one way of talking about objectivity.
[03:08:00.420 --> 03:08:02.500]   There's a whole other way is that I do the experiment,
[03:08:02.500 --> 03:08:04.500]   you do the experiment, we talk to each other,
[03:08:04.500 --> 03:08:07.460]   we agree on methods and we both get the same result.
[03:08:07.460 --> 03:08:10.300]   That is a very different way of thinking about objectivity.
[03:08:10.300 --> 03:08:13.580]   And it acknowledges that, you know,
[03:08:13.580 --> 03:08:15.140]   when we talk about agents,
[03:08:15.140 --> 03:08:18.220]   agency and individuality are flexible, right?
[03:08:18.220 --> 03:08:20.180]   So there's a great paper for speaking of Santa Fe
[03:08:20.180 --> 03:08:21.820]   by David Krakauer, where they looked at sort of
[03:08:21.820 --> 03:08:24.500]   information theoretic measures of individuality.
[03:08:24.500 --> 03:08:26.380]   And what you find is it's actually pretty fluid.
[03:08:26.380 --> 03:08:29.060]   Like my liver cell is an individual,
[03:08:29.060 --> 03:08:30.380]   but really it's part of the liver.
[03:08:30.380 --> 03:08:32.740]   And my liver is, you know, a separate system,
[03:08:32.740 --> 03:08:34.780]   but really it's part of me, but I'm,
[03:08:34.780 --> 03:08:36.340]   so I'm an individual, yay,
[03:08:36.340 --> 03:08:38.060]   but actually I'm part of a society.
[03:08:38.060 --> 03:08:42.420]   Like, and I couldn't be me without the entire community
[03:08:42.420 --> 03:08:43.780]   of say language users, right?
[03:08:43.780 --> 03:08:46.220]   I wouldn't even be able to frame any questions.
[03:08:46.220 --> 03:08:50.020]   And my community of language users is part of ecosystems,
[03:08:50.020 --> 03:08:52.700]   right, that are alive, that I am a part of a lineage of,
[03:08:52.700 --> 03:08:54.300]   this is like Sarah Walker's stuff.
[03:08:54.300 --> 03:08:55.820]   And then that,
[03:08:55.820 --> 03:08:58.100]   those ecosystems are part of the biosphere, right?
[03:08:58.100 --> 03:09:01.140]   We're never separable as opposed to this very atomizing,
[03:09:01.140 --> 03:09:02.860]   the triumphal of this science view
[03:09:02.860 --> 03:09:04.260]   is once like Boltzmann brains.
[03:09:04.260 --> 03:09:07.140]   You're just a brain floating in the space, you know?
[03:09:07.140 --> 03:09:10.300]   - Yeah, there's a fascinating degree
[03:09:10.300 --> 03:09:13.020]   to which agency is fluid.
[03:09:13.020 --> 03:09:14.220]   Like you are an individual,
[03:09:14.220 --> 03:09:17.420]   but you and I talking is a kind of individual.
[03:09:17.420 --> 03:09:18.260]   - Yeah.
[03:09:18.260 --> 03:09:22.460]   - And then the person listening to this right now
[03:09:22.460 --> 03:09:23.540]   is also an individual.
[03:09:23.540 --> 03:09:24.380]   - Right.
[03:09:24.380 --> 03:09:25.220]   - I mean, that's a weird thing too.
[03:09:25.220 --> 03:09:26.060]   - That's a weird thing, right?
[03:09:26.060 --> 03:09:29.220]   - Because there's like, there's a broadcast nature too.
[03:09:29.220 --> 03:09:30.700]   - This is why information theoretic.
[03:09:30.700 --> 03:09:32.700]   So the idea that we're pursuing now,
[03:09:32.700 --> 03:09:33.780]   which I get really excited about
[03:09:33.780 --> 03:09:36.740]   is this idea of information architecture, right?
[03:09:36.740 --> 03:09:39.020]   Or organization, informational organization.
[03:09:39.020 --> 03:09:39.860]   Because you know, right?
[03:09:39.860 --> 03:09:41.820]   Physicalism is like, everything's atoms.
[03:09:41.820 --> 03:09:43.220]   But you know, Kant recognized,
[03:09:43.220 --> 03:09:45.980]   Kant is apparently the one who came up with the word organism
[03:09:45.980 --> 03:09:49.460]   'cause he recognized that life has a weird organization
[03:09:49.460 --> 03:09:52.220]   that was specifically different from machines.
[03:09:52.220 --> 03:09:56.860]   And so this idea that, how do we engage with the idea
[03:09:56.860 --> 03:09:59.860]   that organization, which is often,
[03:09:59.860 --> 03:10:02.820]   I can be cast in information theoretic terms
[03:10:02.820 --> 03:10:05.020]   or computational terms even,
[03:10:05.020 --> 03:10:08.140]   is sort of, it's not really quite physical, right?
[03:10:08.140 --> 03:10:10.660]   It's embodied in physical, you know, in the physical,
[03:10:10.660 --> 03:10:12.060]   it has to instantiate in the physical,
[03:10:12.060 --> 03:10:16.180]   but it also has this other realm of design, you know,
[03:10:16.180 --> 03:10:17.940]   and some not design like intelligent design,
[03:10:17.940 --> 03:10:19.100]   but there's a, you know,
[03:10:19.100 --> 03:10:21.900]   organization itself is a relationship of constraints
[03:10:21.900 --> 03:10:22.980]   and information flow.
[03:10:22.980 --> 03:10:25.300]   And I think, again, that's an entirely new,
[03:10:25.300 --> 03:10:26.580]   interesting way that we might get
[03:10:26.580 --> 03:10:27.820]   a very different kind of science
[03:10:27.820 --> 03:10:29.700]   that would flow out of that.
[03:10:29.700 --> 03:10:34.700]   - So going back to Kant and organism versus machine.
[03:10:34.700 --> 03:10:40.380]   So I showed you a couple of legged robots.
[03:10:40.380 --> 03:10:41.220]   - Very cool.
[03:10:41.220 --> 03:10:44.900]   - Is it possible for machines to have agency?
[03:10:44.900 --> 03:10:48.140]   - I would not discount that possibility.
[03:10:48.140 --> 03:10:52.220]   I think, you know, there's no reason I would say
[03:10:52.220 --> 03:10:54.980]   that it's impossible that machines could,
[03:10:54.980 --> 03:10:57.060]   whatever it manifests, that strange loop
[03:10:57.060 --> 03:11:00.140]   that we're talking about, that autopoiesis,
[03:11:00.140 --> 03:11:01.340]   I don't think there's a reason to say
[03:11:01.340 --> 03:11:06.100]   it can't happen in silicon.
[03:11:06.100 --> 03:11:06.940]   I think whatever it would,
[03:11:06.940 --> 03:11:08.420]   it would be very different from us.
[03:11:08.420 --> 03:11:09.620]   Like the idea that it would be like,
[03:11:09.620 --> 03:11:11.780]   oh, it would be just like us, but now it's instantiated.
[03:11:11.780 --> 03:11:13.580]   I think it might have very different
[03:11:13.580 --> 03:11:15.580]   kind of experiential nature.
[03:11:16.660 --> 03:11:18.980]   I don't think what we have now,
[03:11:18.980 --> 03:11:21.680]   like the LLMs are really there,
[03:11:21.680 --> 03:11:26.140]   but yeah, I'm not gonna say that it's not possible.
[03:11:26.140 --> 03:11:29.060]   - I wonder how far you can get with imitation,
[03:11:29.060 --> 03:11:30.900]   which is essentially what LLMs are doing.
[03:11:30.900 --> 03:11:34.500]   So imitating humans, and I wouldn't discount
[03:11:34.500 --> 03:11:36.660]   either the possibility that through imitation
[03:11:36.660 --> 03:11:40.420]   you can achieve what you would call consciousness
[03:11:40.420 --> 03:11:44.140]   or agency or the ability to have experience.
[03:11:44.140 --> 03:11:45.780]   I think for most of us humans to think,
[03:11:45.780 --> 03:11:48.140]   oh, that's just fake, that's copying.
[03:11:48.140 --> 03:11:51.020]   But there's some degree to which we humans
[03:11:51.020 --> 03:11:53.180]   are just copying each other.
[03:11:53.180 --> 03:11:55.780]   We just are really good imitation machines.
[03:11:55.780 --> 03:11:57.660]   Coming from babies, we were born in this world
[03:11:57.660 --> 03:11:59.460]   and we're just learning to imitate each other.
[03:11:59.460 --> 03:12:01.540]   And through the imitation and the tension
[03:12:01.540 --> 03:12:03.980]   in the disagreements in the imitations,
[03:12:03.980 --> 03:12:08.100]   we gain personality, perspective, all that kind of stuff.
[03:12:08.100 --> 03:12:08.940]   - Yeah.
[03:12:08.940 --> 03:12:11.420]   I think, so it's possible, right?
[03:12:11.420 --> 03:12:12.260]   It's possible.
[03:12:12.260 --> 03:12:14.020]   But I think probably the view I'm advocating
[03:12:14.020 --> 03:12:18.260]   would say that one of the most important parts
[03:12:18.260 --> 03:12:22.140]   of agency is there's something called EFOR,
[03:12:22.140 --> 03:12:24.260]   the EFOR theory of cognition.
[03:12:24.260 --> 03:12:27.340]   Embodiment, inaction, embedding,
[03:12:27.340 --> 03:12:29.380]   and there's another one, extension.
[03:12:29.380 --> 03:12:33.580]   But so the idea is that you actually have to be in a body,
[03:12:33.580 --> 03:12:35.820]   which is itself part of an environment
[03:12:35.820 --> 03:12:39.260]   that is the physical nature of it
[03:12:39.260 --> 03:12:44.220]   and of the extension with other living systems as well
[03:12:44.220 --> 03:12:46.180]   is essential.
[03:12:46.180 --> 03:12:48.420]   So that's why I think the LLMs are not gonna,
[03:12:48.420 --> 03:12:50.420]   it's not just imitation, it's gonna require,
[03:12:50.420 --> 03:12:51.820]   this goes to the brain in the vat thing.
[03:12:51.820 --> 03:12:53.580]   I did an article about the brain in the vat,
[03:12:53.580 --> 03:12:55.820]   which was really Evans, I was reporting on Evans,
[03:12:55.820 --> 03:12:57.900]   where they did the brain in the vat argument,
[03:12:57.900 --> 03:12:59.340]   but they said, look, in the end, actually,
[03:12:59.340 --> 03:13:00.900]   the only way to actually get a real brain in the vat
[03:13:00.900 --> 03:13:02.380]   is actually to have a brain in a body.
[03:13:02.380 --> 03:13:04.500]   And it could be a robot body, you know,
[03:13:04.500 --> 03:13:05.940]   but you still need a brain in the body.
[03:13:05.940 --> 03:13:07.940]   So I don't think LLMs will get there
[03:13:07.940 --> 03:13:09.260]   because they can't, you know,
[03:13:09.260 --> 03:13:11.140]   you really need to be embedded in a world.
[03:13:11.140 --> 03:13:13.300]   At least that's the E4 idea.
[03:13:13.300 --> 03:13:15.500]   - The E4, the 4E approach to cognition
[03:13:15.500 --> 03:13:18.240]   argues that cognition does not occur solely in the head,
[03:13:18.240 --> 03:13:22.980]   but is also embodied, embedded, enacted, and extended
[03:13:22.980 --> 03:13:27.300]   by way of extracranial processes and structures.
[03:13:27.300 --> 03:13:28.700]   They're very much in vogue.
[03:13:28.700 --> 03:13:29.700]   (laughing)
[03:13:29.700 --> 03:13:31.820]   4E cognition has received relatively few
[03:13:31.820 --> 03:13:34.100]   critical evaluations, this is a paper,
[03:13:34.100 --> 03:13:36.420]   but reflecting on two recent collections,
[03:13:36.420 --> 03:13:38.540]   this article reviews the 4E paradigm
[03:13:38.540 --> 03:13:41.840]   with a view to assessing the strengths and weaknesses.
[03:13:41.840 --> 03:13:42.680]   It's fascinating.
[03:13:42.680 --> 03:13:46.420]   I mean, yeah, the branches of what is cognition
[03:13:46.420 --> 03:13:49.300]   extends far, and it could go real far.
[03:13:49.300 --> 03:13:52.580]   - Right, there's a great story about an interaction
[03:13:52.580 --> 03:13:55.060]   between Jonas Salk, who was very much a reductionist,
[03:13:55.060 --> 03:13:56.620]   you know, the great biologist,
[03:13:56.620 --> 03:13:59.460]   and Gregory Bateson, who was a cyberneticist.
[03:13:59.460 --> 03:14:01.420]   And Bateson always loved to poke people.
[03:14:01.420 --> 03:14:03.140]   And he said to Salk, he said, you know,
[03:14:03.140 --> 03:14:04.320]   where's your mind?
[03:14:04.320 --> 03:14:06.860]   And, you know, Salk went, up here, and Bateson said,
[03:14:06.860 --> 03:14:08.820]   no, no, no, out here.
[03:14:08.820 --> 03:14:10.780]   And what he really meant was this extended idea.
[03:14:10.780 --> 03:14:14.460]   It's not just within your cranium, to be, to be,
[03:14:14.460 --> 03:14:16.980]   to have experience, you know, experience in some sense
[03:14:16.980 --> 03:14:20.980]   is not a thing you have, it is a thing you do, right?
[03:14:20.980 --> 03:14:23.300]   It's a, you almost perform it in a way,
[03:14:23.300 --> 03:14:26.300]   which is why both actually having a body,
[03:14:26.300 --> 03:14:28.460]   but having the body itself be in a world
[03:14:28.460 --> 03:14:31.780]   with other bodies is, from this perspective,
[03:14:31.780 --> 03:14:32.620]   is really important.
[03:14:32.620 --> 03:14:34.460]   It's very attractive to me, and, you know, seeing, again,
[03:14:34.460 --> 03:14:35.700]   if we're really gonna do science with them,
[03:14:35.700 --> 03:14:37.300]   we're gonna have to, like, have these ideas
[03:14:37.300 --> 03:14:40.080]   crash up against data, you know, crash up against,
[03:14:40.080 --> 03:14:42.460]   we can't just armchair it, you know, or, you know,
[03:14:42.460 --> 03:14:45.820]   or a quarter, you know, couch quarterbacking it.
[03:14:45.820 --> 03:14:47.540]   But I think there's a lot of possibility here.
[03:14:47.540 --> 03:14:50.860]   It's a very radically different way of looking at,
[03:14:50.860 --> 03:14:53.100]   at what we mean by nature.
[03:14:53.100 --> 03:14:55.340]   - What do you make of the fact that this
[03:14:55.340 --> 03:14:58.300]   individual observer, you as an individual observer,
[03:14:58.380 --> 03:15:03.380]   only get a finite amount of time to exist in this world?
[03:15:03.380 --> 03:15:04.540]   Does it make you sad?
[03:15:04.540 --> 03:15:06.620]   - No, actually, it doesn't make me sad.
[03:15:06.620 --> 03:15:09.980]   So, okay, so, you know, full reveal,
[03:15:09.980 --> 03:15:11.980]   I have been doing contemplative practice
[03:15:11.980 --> 03:15:14.180]   in the Zen tradition for 30 years.
[03:15:14.180 --> 03:15:16.860]   I've been staring at a wall for 30 years.
[03:15:16.860 --> 03:15:18.300]   And it's taught me a lot, right?
[03:15:18.300 --> 03:15:21.700]   You know, I really value what that practice
[03:15:21.700 --> 03:15:25.140]   has given me about the nature of experience.
[03:15:25.140 --> 03:15:26.820]   And one of the things it's taught me is, like, you know,
[03:15:26.820 --> 03:15:28.340]   I don't really matter that very much.
[03:15:28.340 --> 03:15:31.140]   You know, this thing I call Adam Frank is really,
[03:15:31.140 --> 03:15:33.460]   you know, it's kind of a construct, you know?
[03:15:33.460 --> 03:15:35.100]   There's this process going on,
[03:15:35.100 --> 03:15:37.380]   of which I am, actually, fundamentally.
[03:15:37.380 --> 03:15:39.820]   And that's super cool, but, you know, it's gonna go.
[03:15:39.820 --> 03:15:41.660]   I don't, you know, I don't know where it came from.
[03:15:41.660 --> 03:15:42.500]   It's gonna go.
[03:15:42.500 --> 03:15:43.820]   I don't really need it to, you know,
[03:15:43.820 --> 03:15:45.460]   and then, and then who in the hell knows?
[03:15:45.460 --> 03:15:47.540]   You know, I'm not, I'm not an advocate for an afterlife,
[03:15:47.540 --> 03:15:49.780]   but just that, like, you know, what I love,
[03:15:49.780 --> 03:15:52.460]   Zen has this idea of beyond birth and death.
[03:15:52.460 --> 03:15:53.740]   And they don't mean reincarnation.
[03:15:53.740 --> 03:15:56.100]   What they mean is, dude, you don't even really understand
[03:15:56.100 --> 03:15:57.820]   what life is, you know what I mean?
[03:15:57.820 --> 03:15:59.660]   I'm like this, you know, this core level
[03:15:59.660 --> 03:16:00.860]   of your own experience.
[03:16:00.860 --> 03:16:02.900]   So, you know, your ideas about what death is
[03:16:02.900 --> 03:16:05.500]   are equally ill-formed, you know?
[03:16:05.500 --> 03:16:08.260]   And it's, so, you know, the contemplative practice
[03:16:08.260 --> 03:16:10.460]   really tries to focus on experience itself.
[03:16:10.460 --> 03:16:14.460]   Like, spend five days at a Zen session
[03:16:14.460 --> 03:16:16.060]   doing contemplative practice from, you know,
[03:16:16.060 --> 03:16:19.860]   7 a.m. until 9 p.m., obviously with breaks.
[03:16:19.860 --> 03:16:22.100]   And you'll really get a much deeper understanding
[03:16:22.100 --> 03:16:24.140]   of, like, what my own experience is.
[03:16:24.140 --> 03:16:24.980]   What is it really like?
[03:16:24.980 --> 03:16:28.780]   It forces you to learn how to stabilize your attention.
[03:16:28.780 --> 03:16:30.100]   'Cause, you know, attention is kind of like this thing,
[03:16:30.100 --> 03:16:31.620]   like, it's usually just like, oh, over there,
[03:16:31.620 --> 03:16:33.420]   oh, my foot hurts, oh, I gotta do my taxes,
[03:16:33.420 --> 03:16:35.220]   oh, that, you know, what's that guy over there?
[03:16:35.220 --> 03:16:37.220]   Why is he wearing those stupid shoes?
[03:16:37.220 --> 03:16:38.180]   And with the contemplative practice,
[03:16:38.180 --> 03:16:39.620]   you learn how to stabilize it.
[03:16:39.620 --> 03:16:41.060]   And once you stabilize it, you can now begin
[03:16:41.060 --> 03:16:44.220]   to sort of explore the phenomenal nature of it.
[03:16:44.220 --> 03:16:46.780]   So what I think I've learned from that is, like,
[03:16:46.780 --> 03:16:48.340]   kind of whatever, you know?
[03:16:48.340 --> 03:16:50.900]   I'm not really kind of real to begin with.
[03:16:50.900 --> 03:16:53.340]   The Adam Frank part, the identity, the thing.
[03:16:53.340 --> 03:16:56.060]   And the part of me that is real is, you know,
[03:16:56.060 --> 03:16:57.060]   everything's coming and going.
[03:16:57.060 --> 03:16:58.100]   It's all coming and going.
[03:16:58.100 --> 03:17:00.020]   Well, how could I ever not come and go
[03:17:00.020 --> 03:17:03.180]   when the entire world is just, you know?
[03:17:03.180 --> 03:17:05.780]   Buddhism has this idea of codependent arising.
[03:17:05.780 --> 03:17:08.620]   Nothing exists, nothing has self nature.
[03:17:08.620 --> 03:17:10.060]   Nothing exists by itself.
[03:17:10.060 --> 03:17:13.860]   It's an endless, infinitely connected web.
[03:17:13.860 --> 03:17:17.060]   - But still, there's a deliciousness
[03:17:17.060 --> 03:17:18.780]   to the individual experience.
[03:17:18.780 --> 03:17:21.020]   You get attached to it, and it ends,
[03:17:21.020 --> 03:17:24.660]   and it's good while it lasts, and it sucks that it ends.
[03:17:24.660 --> 03:17:27.340]   Like, you can be like, ah, well, everything comes and goes,
[03:17:27.340 --> 03:17:31.380]   but, like, I was eating ice cream yesterday.
[03:17:31.380 --> 03:17:33.780]   Found this awesome low-carb ice cream
[03:17:33.780 --> 03:17:36.100]   called Delight's here in Austin.
[03:17:36.100 --> 03:17:38.580]   And, you know, it ends.
[03:17:38.580 --> 03:17:39.420]   - Yeah, yeah.
[03:17:39.420 --> 03:17:41.820]   - And I was like, and I was staring at the empty container,
[03:17:41.820 --> 03:17:42.660]   and it was--
[03:17:42.660 --> 03:17:44.660]   - That's beautiful, man, I love that.
[03:17:44.660 --> 03:17:46.900]   - You could say, like, yeah, well, that's how it all is,
[03:17:46.900 --> 03:17:47.740]   but--
[03:17:47.740 --> 03:17:49.620]   - Can I say that that's what I've learned from,
[03:17:49.620 --> 03:17:52.100]   'cause I love your idea of the deliciousness of it.
[03:17:52.100 --> 03:17:52.940]   - Yeah.
[03:17:52.940 --> 03:17:53.780]   - You know?
[03:17:53.780 --> 03:17:55.980]   But what I think happens with contemplative practice
[03:17:55.980 --> 03:17:58.220]   when it deepens is that it's not just,
[03:17:58.220 --> 03:17:59.620]   you're not just saying, right?
[03:17:59.620 --> 03:18:01.940]   This is why, you know, so I do koan practice.
[03:18:01.940 --> 03:18:04.660]   So this is a tradition in Zen that it was established,
[03:18:04.660 --> 03:18:06.700]   it was a teaching method that was established,
[03:18:06.700 --> 03:18:09.260]   like, a thousand years ago, these book of koans.
[03:18:09.260 --> 03:18:11.380]   And every koan, you know, if you've ever read
[03:18:11.380 --> 03:18:13.980]   Gödel, Escher, Bach, he's got a whole chapter on koans.
[03:18:13.980 --> 03:18:16.420]   They're kind of non-logical problems
[03:18:16.420 --> 03:18:18.140]   that you have to work on.
[03:18:18.140 --> 03:18:19.580]   One of my favorite one was,
[03:18:19.580 --> 03:18:22.980]   "Stop the sound of the distant temple bell."
[03:18:22.980 --> 03:18:24.460]   You know, you're like, "What?"
[03:18:24.460 --> 03:18:26.300]   Every time my teacher gives it to me, I'm like,
[03:18:26.300 --> 03:18:27.580]   "What are you talking about?"
[03:18:27.580 --> 03:18:29.580]   You know, this whole Zen thing of like,
[03:18:29.580 --> 03:18:32.380]   "Up is down, but down is up, you must understand this."
[03:18:32.380 --> 03:18:33.980]   So, you know, your job with these koans
[03:18:33.980 --> 03:18:36.100]   is to sit with them, is to sit with them
[03:18:36.100 --> 03:18:38.220]   until you sort of kind of, you know,
[03:18:38.220 --> 03:18:40.340]   you realize what the thing is trying to teach you,
[03:18:40.340 --> 03:18:42.900]   what aspect of experience it's trying to teach you.
[03:18:42.900 --> 03:18:44.020]   So there's no answer, there's no,
[03:18:44.020 --> 03:18:45.740]   and in fact, actually, you don't give an answer,
[03:18:45.740 --> 03:18:47.700]   you actually usually have to demonstrate.
[03:18:47.700 --> 03:18:49.460]   The first time when I sat and when I did a koan
[03:18:49.460 --> 03:18:51.220]   and the guy was like, "Don't tell me the answer,
[03:18:51.220 --> 03:18:52.060]   show me the answer."
[03:18:52.060 --> 03:18:54.380]   I was like, "What are you talking about?"
[03:18:54.380 --> 03:18:55.820]   But after doing these for years now,
[03:18:55.820 --> 03:18:59.460]   you know, I've kind of learned the language of them.
[03:18:59.460 --> 03:19:01.340]   So I could never tell you, if I told you the answer,
[03:19:01.340 --> 03:19:02.580]   I could give you a koan and tell you the answer,
[03:19:02.580 --> 03:19:03.660]   you'd be like, "What?"
[03:19:03.660 --> 03:19:07.380]   You know, it's never, it's not the words, it's the, you know,
[03:19:07.380 --> 03:19:10.140]   so like your experience of like, "Yeah, the cup is empty."
[03:19:10.140 --> 03:19:12.700]   With contemplative practice, as it deepens over years,
[03:19:12.700 --> 03:19:14.660]   it really does take years, just like anything in math,
[03:19:14.660 --> 03:19:17.100]   it took me years to understand Lagrangians.
[03:19:17.100 --> 03:19:18.860]   You kind of come to a deeper understanding with like,
[03:19:18.860 --> 03:19:20.980]   yeah, the words of like, it's not just like,
[03:19:20.980 --> 03:19:22.300]   "Oh, everything changes."
[03:19:22.300 --> 03:19:24.340]   You actually feel that movement.
[03:19:24.340 --> 03:19:27.780]   Like you feel it with like breath to breath, you know?
[03:19:27.780 --> 03:19:30.460]   And it really becomes, sometimes I have this feeling,
[03:19:30.460 --> 03:19:32.940]   this is messed up, but of just joy,
[03:19:32.940 --> 03:19:34.660]   and it's not connected to anything, right?
[03:19:34.660 --> 03:19:36.140]   That's what I've kind of gotten from practice.
[03:19:36.140 --> 03:19:38.820]   It's just like, yeah, you know, that passage,
[03:19:38.820 --> 03:19:41.540]   that infinite passage of moment to moment,
[03:19:41.540 --> 03:19:44.580]   that is truly the way things are, and it's okay.
[03:19:44.580 --> 03:19:45.420]   Like not, it's not okay
[03:19:45.420 --> 03:19:46.860]   because I have a feeling about it, okay?
[03:19:46.860 --> 03:19:48.140]   I want it to be okay.
[03:19:48.140 --> 03:19:49.620]   It just is okay.
[03:19:49.620 --> 03:19:51.100]   It's a really, it's a pretty awesome thing.
[03:19:51.100 --> 03:19:51.940]   - Yeah, that's beautiful.
[03:19:51.940 --> 03:19:53.740]   I mean, maybe it's the genetics,
[03:19:53.740 --> 03:19:55.300]   maybe it's the biochemistry of my brain,
[03:19:55.300 --> 03:19:58.100]   but I generally have that joy about experience,
[03:19:58.100 --> 03:20:00.180]   just amorphous joy.
[03:20:00.180 --> 03:20:01.500]   But it seems like, again,
[03:20:01.500 --> 03:20:03.300]   maybe it's my Eastern European roots,
[03:20:03.300 --> 03:20:05.100]   but there's always like a melancholy
[03:20:05.100 --> 03:20:07.540]   that's also sitting next to the joy.
[03:20:07.540 --> 03:20:09.580]   And I think it always feels
[03:20:09.580 --> 03:20:12.940]   like they're intricately linked.
[03:20:12.940 --> 03:20:15.500]   So the melancholy is about,
[03:20:15.500 --> 03:20:17.860]   maybe about the finiteness of experience,
[03:20:17.860 --> 03:20:20.660]   and the joy is just about the beauty of experience,
[03:20:20.660 --> 03:20:21.980]   and they're just kind of sitting there.
[03:20:21.980 --> 03:20:22.820]   - Yeah.
[03:20:22.820 --> 03:20:23.940]   Which is cool, actually, because that,
[03:20:23.940 --> 03:20:24.780]   you know, I'm also, you know,
[03:20:24.780 --> 03:20:27.380]   I come from Eastern, my roots are Eastern European
[03:20:27.380 --> 03:20:29.940]   as well, going back, and I get it, right?
[03:20:29.940 --> 03:20:32.260]   I mean, you know, but that's also the cool thing.
[03:20:32.260 --> 03:20:33.780]   I think one of the things is like,
[03:20:33.780 --> 03:20:35.380]   yeah, well, that is what it is.
[03:20:35.380 --> 03:20:36.300]   That is what it is, right?
[03:20:36.300 --> 03:20:37.140]   You don't have to do anything.
[03:20:37.140 --> 03:20:38.340]   You don't have to like manipulate it
[03:20:38.340 --> 03:20:39.540]   or move it around or like,
[03:20:39.540 --> 03:20:41.140]   yeah, this is the experience, you know?
[03:20:41.140 --> 03:20:42.980]   - Can you speak to just the practical nature
[03:20:42.980 --> 03:20:44.980]   of sitting there from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m.?
[03:20:44.980 --> 03:20:46.820]   Like, what the hell are you doing, bro?
[03:20:46.820 --> 03:20:47.660]   - What's powerful?
[03:20:47.660 --> 03:20:48.500]   What's fascinating to you?
[03:20:48.500 --> 03:20:50.420]   What have you learned from just the experience
[03:20:50.420 --> 03:20:51.580]   of staring at a wall?
[03:20:51.580 --> 03:20:52.580]   - Yeah, yeah.
[03:20:52.580 --> 03:20:54.260]   So, you know, it's not really,
[03:20:54.260 --> 03:20:55.820]   I mean, you're staring, you're facing a wall,
[03:20:55.820 --> 03:20:58.260]   and what you're doing is you're just sitting with,
[03:20:58.260 --> 03:20:59.100]   you know, you can,
[03:20:59.100 --> 03:21:00.820]   there's different meditative practices, right?
[03:21:00.820 --> 03:21:01.740]   There's counting breaths.
[03:21:01.740 --> 03:21:02.580]   So that's usually what I do.
[03:21:02.580 --> 03:21:03.900]   I sit down, I start counting breaths,
[03:21:03.900 --> 03:21:04.980]   and for the first half hour,
[03:21:04.980 --> 03:21:07.140]   it's just like blah, blah, blah.
[03:21:07.140 --> 03:21:09.220]   I'm thinking, like I said, I'm thinking about my taxes,
[03:21:09.220 --> 03:21:10.860]   I'm thinking about what I gotta do later on,
[03:21:10.860 --> 03:21:12.020]   yada, yada, yada.
[03:21:12.060 --> 03:21:14.420]   First time I ever did a full session,
[03:21:14.420 --> 03:21:15.540]   a two-day session, I swear to God,
[03:21:15.540 --> 03:21:17.300]   I had Bruce Springsteen's "Born to Run" album
[03:21:17.300 --> 03:21:19.780]   track through from the beginning to the end
[03:21:19.780 --> 03:21:21.860]   with the pauses, back in when there were LPs.
[03:21:21.860 --> 03:21:22.700]   - Yeah. - With the frickin' pauses.
[03:21:22.700 --> 03:21:23.740]   - Nice.
[03:21:23.740 --> 03:21:24.900]   - You know, 'cause my mind was just like,
[03:21:24.900 --> 03:21:25.740]   I need to do something.
[03:21:25.740 --> 03:21:28.380]   So it literally played the whole album in order.
[03:21:28.380 --> 03:21:29.300]   - That's pretty cool, actually.
[03:21:29.300 --> 03:21:30.620]   - Yeah, it was pretty amazing to see,
[03:21:30.620 --> 03:21:31.460]   you know, 'cause you really do,
[03:21:31.460 --> 03:21:33.580]   you see the dynamics of your mind.
[03:21:33.580 --> 03:21:35.980]   But what happens is, and this took me a while,
[03:21:35.980 --> 03:21:38.300]   I used to hate sitting, you know?
[03:21:38.300 --> 03:21:43.300]   I do it, but I, after a while, the mind gets exhausted.
[03:21:43.300 --> 03:21:45.700]   Like that part of the mind, the upper level,
[03:21:45.700 --> 03:21:47.260]   the roof brain chatter, it's just like,
[03:21:47.260 --> 03:21:48.580]   there's nothing else to do.
[03:21:48.580 --> 03:21:50.380]   And then you get bored, and now I realize
[03:21:50.380 --> 03:21:52.780]   that's when something interesting is gonna happen.
[03:21:52.780 --> 03:21:54.340]   'Cause you kinda like drop down.
[03:21:54.340 --> 03:21:57.060]   And now, it's a very physical practice.
[03:21:57.060 --> 03:21:59.060]   People think you're just sitting there not thinking,
[03:21:59.060 --> 03:22:00.540]   or thinking about not thinking.
[03:22:00.540 --> 03:22:02.140]   Actually, it becomes a very physical process
[03:22:02.140 --> 03:22:04.300]   where you're really just following the breath,
[03:22:04.300 --> 03:22:06.060]   you're kinda riding the breath,
[03:22:06.060 --> 03:22:08.780]   and it gets very quiet, you know?
[03:22:08.780 --> 03:22:11.660]   And within that quietness, it's, you know,
[03:22:11.660 --> 03:22:14.180]   there's a path, you know, 'cause obviously there's been,
[03:22:14.180 --> 03:22:15.860]   Buddhism's always like, you know,
[03:22:15.860 --> 03:22:18.660]   not about thinking, but there's a huge literature.
[03:22:18.660 --> 03:22:20.180]   So these guys are always about don't think,
[03:22:20.180 --> 03:22:21.540]   I've written all this stuff.
[03:22:21.540 --> 03:22:22.380]   But they're guideposts,
[03:22:22.380 --> 03:22:24.420]   they're like the finger pointing at the moon.
[03:22:24.420 --> 03:22:26.580]   And, you know, there's the idea of first,
[03:22:26.580 --> 03:22:28.540]   you know, your mind is usually scattered, right?
[03:22:28.540 --> 03:22:29.940]   Like, right now when I walk out,
[03:22:29.940 --> 03:22:30.900]   I'm gonna go get the Uber and everything,
[03:22:30.900 --> 03:22:32.420]   my mind's gonna be all over the place.
[03:22:32.420 --> 03:22:34.700]   But with sitting, first you concentrate the mind
[03:22:34.700 --> 03:22:36.100]   so that there's no more scatter anymore.
[03:22:36.100 --> 03:22:37.020]   The thoughts are still happening,
[03:22:37.020 --> 03:22:38.580]   but you're just not, they're happening up there,
[03:22:38.580 --> 03:22:40.100]   you're not even paying attention to 'em.
[03:22:40.100 --> 03:22:43.700]   And then as time goes on, you unify the mind,
[03:22:43.700 --> 03:22:45.820]   which is this very powerful thing
[03:22:45.820 --> 03:22:48.620]   where kind of the self drops away, you know?
[03:22:48.620 --> 03:22:49.940]   And there's just this presence,
[03:22:49.940 --> 03:22:51.900]   it's kind of like a raw presence.
[03:22:51.900 --> 03:22:55.860]   And that's often where the joy upwells from.
[03:22:55.860 --> 03:22:56.700]   But you sit with whatever,
[03:22:56.700 --> 03:22:58.100]   maybe you're gonna sit and you're gonna have,
[03:22:58.100 --> 03:23:00.060]   like, you know, maybe you're gonna go through like
[03:23:00.060 --> 03:23:02.420]   an hour of being bummed out about your mom
[03:23:02.420 --> 03:23:03.260]   who died or something.
[03:23:03.260 --> 03:23:05.420]   You know, you're just gonna sit with whatever comes up.
[03:23:05.420 --> 03:23:07.460]   You're gonna make the, that's why the sitting part,
[03:23:07.460 --> 03:23:08.300]   you're making the commitment,
[03:23:08.300 --> 03:23:10.180]   "I'm gonna sit here with whatever comes up.
[03:23:10.180 --> 03:23:11.500]   "I will not be moved."
[03:23:11.500 --> 03:23:12.780]   And then what you come away with,
[03:23:12.780 --> 03:23:13.660]   it actually, over time,
[03:23:13.660 --> 03:23:15.460]   it actually changes kind of who you are.
[03:23:15.460 --> 03:23:18.180]   Like, I'm still the asshole I was from New Jersey
[03:23:18.180 --> 03:23:21.220]   growing up, but I just have more space now for things,
[03:23:21.220 --> 03:23:22.060]   you know?
[03:23:22.060 --> 03:23:25.860]   - Yeah, once Jersey, always Jersey.
[03:23:25.860 --> 03:23:27.020]   - Always Jersey.
[03:23:27.020 --> 03:23:28.820]   - But I love the Bruce Springsteen's
[03:23:28.820 --> 03:23:29.660]   just blasting in your head.
[03:23:29.660 --> 03:23:30.980]   - Yeah, that was amazing.
[03:23:30.980 --> 03:23:31.820]   - Why are we here?
[03:23:31.820 --> 03:23:33.780]   What do you think is the purpose,
[03:23:33.780 --> 03:23:35.820]   the meaning of human existence?
[03:23:35.820 --> 03:23:37.740]   - It's good that we just had the last conversation
[03:23:37.740 --> 03:23:40.540]   because I'm gonna give this answer, which is so corny.
[03:23:40.540 --> 03:23:42.900]   It's love.
[03:23:42.900 --> 03:23:43.820]   And I'm not messing around
[03:23:43.820 --> 03:23:44.860]   'cause really actually what happens, you know,
[03:23:44.860 --> 03:23:46.700]   so within Buddhism,
[03:23:46.700 --> 03:23:48.580]   there's the idea of the Bodhisattva principle.
[03:23:48.580 --> 03:23:49.540]   You're here to help.
[03:23:49.540 --> 03:23:50.900]   You're just here to help, right?
[03:23:50.900 --> 03:23:53.700]   Compassion, like that's a really essential part
[03:23:53.700 --> 03:23:55.860]   of this path, of the Dharma path.
[03:23:55.860 --> 03:23:57.540]   And when I first started, I was like,
[03:23:57.540 --> 03:23:58.760]   "I don't care about compassion.
[03:23:58.760 --> 03:24:00.000]   "I'm here for knowledge, right?
[03:24:00.940 --> 03:24:02.780]   "I started contemplative practice
[03:24:02.780 --> 03:24:04.020]   "because of the usual thing, I was suffering.
[03:24:04.020 --> 03:24:04.940]   "I had, you know, the reason everybody
[03:24:04.940 --> 03:24:05.780]   "comes to things like this.
[03:24:05.780 --> 03:24:06.620]   "You know, life was hard.
[03:24:06.620 --> 03:24:07.860]   "I was going through stuff."
[03:24:07.860 --> 03:24:09.580]   But I also wanted knowledge.
[03:24:09.580 --> 03:24:11.820]   I wanted to understand the foundational nature of reality.
[03:24:11.820 --> 03:24:13.540]   So it was like compassion, whatever.
[03:24:13.540 --> 03:24:16.060]   But then I found out that you can't get that.
[03:24:16.060 --> 03:24:16.900]   You can't get those.
[03:24:16.900 --> 03:24:18.500]   You can't go to this without compassion.
[03:24:18.500 --> 03:24:20.520]   Somehow in this process,
[03:24:20.520 --> 03:24:23.900]   you realize that it really is about
[03:24:23.900 --> 03:24:27.260]   helping all sentient beings.
[03:24:27.260 --> 03:24:28.100]   That's the way they, you know,
[03:24:28.100 --> 03:24:30.440]   just being here to help.
[03:24:30.440 --> 03:24:32.280]   So I know that sounds cornball,
[03:24:32.280 --> 03:24:33.600]   but especially for a guy from Jersey,
[03:24:33.600 --> 03:24:35.800]   which is like, you know, the main thing is to get over.
[03:24:35.800 --> 03:24:37.800]   You're like, "Your job is to get over."
[03:24:37.800 --> 03:24:40.200]   But that's really what I found.
[03:24:40.200 --> 03:24:42.360]   It is actually kind of, and that's what that joy,
[03:24:42.360 --> 03:24:44.800]   that joy, some of that joy is just, it's like this.
[03:24:44.800 --> 03:24:47.000]   One of the things I have, when I have like really,
[03:24:47.000 --> 03:24:48.680]   you know, there's a kind of experience
[03:24:48.680 --> 03:24:49.720]   I'll have in contemplative practice,
[03:24:49.720 --> 03:24:50.960]   which we'll carry out into the world,
[03:24:50.960 --> 03:24:52.680]   which is just this gratitude for the fact
[03:24:52.680 --> 03:24:55.280]   that the world is just, the world gives you everything.
[03:24:55.280 --> 03:24:56.220]   And there's a certain way, right?
[03:24:56.220 --> 03:24:58.640]   Just the blue sky and the breath,
[03:24:58.640 --> 03:25:01.700]   the world is just giving you itself completely unhindered.
[03:25:01.700 --> 03:25:03.520]   It holds nothing back.
[03:25:03.520 --> 03:25:05.040]   And yeah, that's kind of the experience.
[03:25:05.040 --> 03:25:06.960]   And then you kind of like, "Oh, I need to be helpful
[03:25:06.960 --> 03:25:08.560]   'cause who's not having this experience?"
[03:25:08.560 --> 03:25:09.400]   You know?
[03:25:09.400 --> 03:25:10.880]   - So just love for the world as it is.
[03:25:10.880 --> 03:25:12.720]   - Love for the world and all the beings who are suffering.
[03:25:12.720 --> 03:25:14.760]   Everybody's suffering, everybody's suffering.
[03:25:14.760 --> 03:25:16.760]   You know, your worst political opponent,
[03:25:16.760 --> 03:25:18.480]   they're suffering, you know?
[03:25:18.480 --> 03:25:21.760]   And our job is just to try and drop our biases
[03:25:21.760 --> 03:25:24.240]   and our stories and see this fundamental level
[03:25:24.240 --> 03:25:26.260]   at which life is occurring.
[03:25:26.260 --> 03:25:29.860]   - And hopefully there's many alien civilizations out there
[03:25:29.860 --> 03:25:30.900]   going through the same journey
[03:25:30.900 --> 03:25:32.180]   out of suffering towards love.
[03:25:32.180 --> 03:25:33.700]   - Yeah, that would, you know,
[03:25:33.700 --> 03:25:35.180]   that may be a universal thing
[03:25:35.180 --> 03:25:36.580]   about what it means to be alive.
[03:25:36.580 --> 03:25:37.420]   - I hope so.
[03:25:37.420 --> 03:25:38.240]   - I hope so too.
[03:25:38.240 --> 03:25:39.780]   They're coming to eat us.
[03:25:39.780 --> 03:25:41.580]   - Especially if they're a type three civilization.
[03:25:41.580 --> 03:25:42.420]   - Yeah, that's right.
[03:25:42.420 --> 03:25:43.740]   And they got really big guns.
[03:25:43.740 --> 03:25:45.820]   (Adam laughs)
[03:25:45.820 --> 03:25:48.300]   - Well, this was a truly mind-blowing, fascinating,
[03:25:48.300 --> 03:25:49.740]   just awesome conversation, Adam.
[03:25:49.740 --> 03:25:50.900]   Thank you for everything you do
[03:25:50.900 --> 03:25:52.180]   and thank you for talking today.
[03:25:52.180 --> 03:25:53.020]   - Oh, thank you.
[03:25:53.020 --> 03:25:54.740]   It's been a lot of fun.
[03:25:54.740 --> 03:25:56.340]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[03:25:56.340 --> 03:25:57.660]   with Adam Frank.

[03:26:01.700 --> 03:26:05.140]   And now let me leave you with some words from Carl Sagan.
[03:26:05.140 --> 03:26:10.140]   "The cosmos is all that is or ever was or ever will be.
[03:26:10.140 --> 03:26:14.100]   Our feeblest contemplations of the cosmos stir us.
[03:26:14.100 --> 03:26:16.380]   There's a tingling in the spine, a catch in the voice,
[03:26:16.380 --> 03:26:19.700]   a faint sensation as if a distant memory
[03:26:19.700 --> 03:26:21.260]   or falling from a height.
[03:26:22.180 --> 03:26:26.780]   We know we are approaching the greatest of mysteries."
[03:26:26.780 --> 03:26:30.680]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
