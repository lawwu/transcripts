[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.280]   Our first question comes from Clarissa.
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:16.280]   Clarissa asks, "I do a daily schedule, but how do I avoid feeling like it's redundant?
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.040]   Sometimes I don't need to change things around and I skip scheduling my time block
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.920]   and then it snowballs into one day and then two days, the next thing you know, it's a week."
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:34.240]   Well, Clarissa, let's focus in on this issue of falling off the habit of daily time block
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.120]   planning and how that can snowball to many days without it.
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.040]   Typically, it's a sign that you're overworked.
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.040]   There's too much going on, your mind is exhausted.
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.560]   So I think it's actually an important signal.
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.440]   It's not a failing, it's an important signal that maybe we need to pull back on commitments
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.680]   so that the amount we're doing each day is less and try to get more time off.
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.920]   Your mind needs time off and it's getting it informally by just refusing,
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.080]   mentally speaking, to do any planning.
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.720]   The thing I'm going to recommend that you do persist with, even during these periods,
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.600]   is some sort of bare bones tracking.
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.960]   So for me, it's the metric tracking space in my time block planner.
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.680]   There's certain key metrics I write in there every day.
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.440]   I never skip that.
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.960]   That's Sacro saying.
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.840]   Now, this takes 20 seconds and you just do it at the end of the day,
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:36.160]   but it keeps you at least in a mindset of, I am being intentional, I'm keeping track of my life.
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.960]   I have not just given up on intentionality in my living altogether,
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.240]   even though it only takes 20 seconds.
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.000]   And even if what you're writing down is really bad.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.680]   So if there's things you track, like, did I read today?
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:46.640]   Did I eat well today?
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:47.520]   Did I exercise today?
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.720]   You're not doing all of it.
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.960]   You're writing that down, saying that you didn't do it.
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.320]   Bad or not bad.
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.680]   That is like a bare bones fallback plan that I'm always doing that,
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.600]   even if I'm not getting around to my time block planning.
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.680]   And then it makes it much easier.
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.880]   So okay, well, now let me actually go back to doing my time block plans.
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.040]   So do the fallback mode.
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.800]   So I have the very basic behavior, the metric train tracking, you never stop doing.
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.280]   So you never leave the mindset of I control my life.
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.240]   And I care about what's happening in my life, even if it takes 20 seconds.
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.360]   And then two, if you're consistently skipping time blocking,
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.080]   take that as a signal that you have too much going on.
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.880]   That's okay.
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:21.840]   It's an important signal.
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.600]   You need a day off.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.720]   You need earlier shutdowns.
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.160]   You need to take three things off your plate.
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:40.400]   It's useful information, not a sign that you're doing something wrong.
