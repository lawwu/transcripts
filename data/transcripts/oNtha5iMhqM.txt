[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   (music)
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   There's much to learn from 18th century pastor and hymn writer John Newton.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   Newton's autobiography was a best-selling hit in his day, and we still sing his hymns today.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   His whole life is a testament to God's sovereign grace in saving a wretched sinner,
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   a story captured well in his most famous hymn, Amazing Grace.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   And we celebrate John Newton's birthday today.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   So today has me thinking about him, his hymns, and his living legacy.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   It's a rich legacy he left behind.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   I was honored to write a whole book on his pastoral counsel,
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   and that really gave me the chance to soak in his pastoral letters for about three years.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   He wrote amazing letters to people who were in need and needing answers,
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   something very reminiscent to this podcast.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   And Pastor John has a wonderful biographical message looking at the life of Newton.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   It's titled, "John Newton, the Tough Roots of His Habitual Tenderness."
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   And particularly, Newton has a lot to teach us on the topic of controversy
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   and how to argue like a Calvinist.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   Here's Pastor John in that 2001 biographical message,
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   talking about John Newton's approach to controversy and speaking to a room of pastors.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Here's what he said.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   Now maybe the most illuminating way to get at this man's pattern of tenderness
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   is to talk about the way he handled his Calvinism and his doctrine
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   and controversies of his day and so on.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   This is something I'm very, very interested in for us and for myself in particular.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   At this point, we're going to see the root bearing fruit in tenderness.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   The root of truth bearing fruit in tenderness called love.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   I think his patience and his perception guided him between a doctrinaire intellectualism over here
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   and a doctrinal indifference and carelessness over here.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   So let's talk for a minute about his patience, tenderness as it relates to his doctrine.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Here's what he says first.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   A lot of people ask me, I've been here 20 years now, so I'm starting to feel old
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   and people are starting to treat me that way.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   And so I get asked a lot about what did you do at this point, at this point, at this point, this, this, this.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   He said, "I have been 30 years forming my own views.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   And in the course of this time, some of my hills have sunken, some of my valleys have risen.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   But how unreasonable within me to expect all this should take place in another person
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   and that in a course of a year or two.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   I mean, some of you have been on your way theologically for 20, 30, 40 years
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   and you might have a thing or two figured out.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   And you start preaching and teaching as though this class should have fixed the atonement for these people.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   "Predestination, we got this now. You've been to my classes."
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   And it took you 20 years to settle in on where you are.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   So he's calling for us with tenderness and patience to realize that that's the case.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   It's not going to happen for our people any faster than it did for us and for some slower.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Yes, he had a passion for propagating the truth, the whole reformed vision of God as he saw it.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   But he did not believe controversy served the purpose.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Here's what he said, "I see the unprofitableness of controversy in the case of Job and his friends.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   For if God had not interposed, had they lived to this day, they would be still disputing."
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   So he labored to avoid controversy and replace it with positive demonstrations of truth.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   Here's what he said, "My principal method of defeating heresy is by the establishing of truth.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   One proposes to fill a bushel with tares. Now, if I can fill it first with wheat, I shall defy his attempts."
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   He knew, given his Calvinism, that the embrace of many glorious, precious truths
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   required supernatural spiritual illumination from God on the inside.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   And therefore, he made his approach patient and unobtrusive.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   He's the way he said it, "I am a friend of peace and being deeply convinced that no one can profitably understand
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   the great truths and doctrines of the gospel any farther than he is taught of God.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   I have not a wish to obtrude my own tenets upon others in a way of controversy.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Yet I do not think myself bound to conceal them."
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   He said in the introduction of the old hymns, "The views I have received of the doctrines of grace,
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   code name Calvinism, are essential to my peace. I could not live comfortably a day or an hour without them.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   I likewise believe them to be friendly to holiness and to have a direct influence in producing and maintaining a gospel conversation.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   And therefore, I must not be ashamed of them."
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   But then he adds this, "The cause of truth itself may be discredited by an improper management.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   The scripture which teaches us what we are to say is equally explicit in the temper and spirit in which we are to speak.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   Though I had knowledge of all mysteries and the tongue of an angel to declare them,
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   I could hope for little acceptance or usefulness unless I was to speak in love."
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   Listen to this. He says, amazing, "Of all people who engage in controversy,
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   we who are called Calvinists are most expressly bound by our own principles to exercise gentleness and moderation.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   The scriptural maxim, 'The wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God,' is verified daily in our observation.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   If our zeal is embittered by expressions of anger, invective or scorn,
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   we may think we are doing service to the cause of truth when in reality we shall only bring it into discredit."
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   He noticed one of the most Calvinistic texts in the New Testament calls for patient tenderness.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   You know which one I'm thinking about? One of the most Calvinistic texts in the New Testament.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   It's 2 Timothy 22-24 to 26. I'll read it.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   Notice what Paul brings together here. Newton noticed it. Had a huge impact on him.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   "The Lord's servant must not be quarrelsome, but kindly to everyone, an apt teacher,
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   forbearing, correcting his opponents with gentleness."
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   Then comes the Calvinistic part.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   "God may perhaps grant that they will repent and come to know the truth,
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   and escape from the snare of the devil, after having been captured by him to do his will."
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   Wow! That's a very powerful text.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   God grants repentance. God brings people to know the truth. So what's our part?
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   "Not quarrelsome, kindly to everyone, apt teacher, forbearing, correcting in gentleness."
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   There's the Calvinistic agenda. Isn't it amazing what he puts together there?
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   Newton saw it. Have you seen it? Do you do it?
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   And given that Calvinistic truth that God's the one who grants repentance,
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   God's the one who opens the eyes of the blind to see the truth, prayer became utterly crucial for him.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   Prayer is asking God to do what only God can do. Man can't do it. God has to do it.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   You preach to people on Sunday, you're not going to change anybody in an evangelical, deep, heartfelt way.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   God's got to do that. You have your role. It's described right there.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   But God's going to do it. So if you don't obey that thing in prayer,
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   you're missing one of the great means of grace that God has appointed for you.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   And this is what he said about prayer in controversy.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   He writes to a friend, "As to your opponent, I wish that before you set pen to paper against him,
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   and during the whole time you are preparing your answer,
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   you may commend him by earnest prayer to the Lord's teaching and blessing.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   This practice will have a direct tendency to conciliate your heart to love and pity him,
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   and such a disposition will have a good influence upon every page you write.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   If he is a believer, in a little while you will meet him in heaven.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   He will then be dearer to you than the nearest friend you have on earth.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   Anticipate that period in your thoughts.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   If he is an unconverted person, he's more properly the object of your compassion than your anger.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   Alas, he knows not what he does, but you know who has made you to differ.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   Namely, not you. You didn't make you to differ.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   1 Corinthians 4, 7. God made you to differ."
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   Yeah, one of my all-time favorite biographical sketches.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   Newton, of course, could draw lines.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   He drew very bold lines around Wesleyan perfectionism, for example, and he roundly condemned it.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   And in the second half of his life, he spoke out boldly against the African slave trade,
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   the very trade that he participated in in the first half of his life.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   He could draw very bold lines, but he was so careful to do it in a humble sense of God's sovereignty.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   You can read Newton's famous letter on controversy.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   That's its title, "On Controversy." There's even more of this theme.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   This sermon excerpt was taken from the message titled, "John Newton, the Tough Roots of His Habitual Tenderness."
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   That full biographical message is available online at DesiringGod.org.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   And the title of my book is, "Newton on the Christian Life to Live as Christ."
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   Well, in a week, we will look at how controversy is both essential and deadly.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   There's a powerful lesson to be learned here, and that's coming up next Wednesday in a week.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   Stay tuned for that.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   But first up, if we read our Bibles, why do we need to listen to sermons also?
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   Isn't personal Bible reading enough?
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   Pastor John will say an emphatic no and explain why not next time when we close out the week with Pastor John back in the studio with us.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   I am Tony Reinke. We'll see you on Friday. Thanks for listening.
