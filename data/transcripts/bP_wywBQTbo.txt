[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.600]   In 2011, author John Knapp published an evocatively titled book, "How the Church Fails Business
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.580]   People and What Can Be Done About It." In it, he argued that the church has not helped
[00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.680]   Christians succeed in the secular business world because churches have not helped Christians
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.340]   in the secular business world develop the day-to-day ethical decision-making skills
[00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.000]   that they need. It's a bold accusation, but it's also one that implies quite a lot about
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.800]   the relationship of the church to Christian leaders in the secular business world.
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.160]   So has the modern church failed to equip business people? And if so, what can be done about
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.600]   it? Those are my questions to Dr. Albert Moeller, among Reformed leaders in America. I'm not
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.280]   aware of many gifted leaders who have proven it over the decades more than Moeller has.
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.240]   He's the president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky,
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.020]   where he brought unimaginable institutional transformation, which has now been documented
[00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:02.600]   in the 2015 book, "Baptists in America, a History," by Thomas Kidd and Barry Hankins.
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.560]   Moeller is not only a leader, he's written a book on leadership titled, "The Conviction
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.120]   to Lead, 25 Principles for Leadership that Matters." I talked with him and began by asking
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.720]   him if the church has let business people down, and if so, how?
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.520]   I think the church has failed not so much by a strategic decision to ignore the business
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.080]   world, but by a couple of things, a confluence of the fact that many churches simply don't
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.280]   know what to do with the world of business. And that is partly because of the social distance,
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.800]   and otherwise because some churches simply don't have the kind of natural entree into
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.760]   that context. I think the second reason, though, is a little more serious, and that is a lack
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.900]   of confidence that we really know what to say in that world. And I think we do. I would
[00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:56.340]   not suggest that Christianity comes with a technical and comprehensive stated economic
[00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:03.000]   or fiscal policy, but it does come with the application of Christian truth, who is deployed
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.840]   for the glory of God in the world of business.
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.680]   Yeah, yeah. In your book, one of the most helpful points you make is that leadership
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:13.400]   is about storytelling. You write this, "No organization that exists simply for itself
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.240]   is worth leading. Leaders want to lead organizations and movements that make a difference, that
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.760]   fill a need and solve real problems. That story frames the mission and identity of the
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.080]   organization and explains why you give your life to it. The excellent leader is the steward
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.000]   and chief of that story, and the leader's chief responsibilities flow from this stewardship.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.840]   Leadership comes down to protecting the story, bringing others into the story, and keeping
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:45.920]   the organization accountable to the story. The leader tells the story over and over again,
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:53.440]   refining it, updating it, and driving it home." Explain this idea more for us that leadership
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.440]   is storytelling.
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.360]   Well, it's more than that, of course, but it's never less than that, because any leader
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.800]   seeking to lead in any important endeavor ends up telling a story about where things
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:09.000]   are and where they need to be. And furthermore, the leader comes with his or her own story.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.200]   That story becomes a part of explaining how the convictions have come to take possession
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:20.880]   of the leader and why he wants others to be a part of that story in order for the organization,
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:29.000]   the congregation, the institution, the family, whatever group it is, to arrive at the destination
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.080]   that is implied by and fulfilled by the story. So whether it's a political leader saying,
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.960]   "This is what America's all about. This is what we were founded to be. This is now what
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:46.040]   we need to do." Or whether it's Moses reminding the children of Israel over and over again,
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.200]   "Remember your story. We were in bondage to Pharaoh in Egypt, but God brought us out
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.200]   by his mighty hand." And then everything that follows is predicated on the fact that,
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.440]   "Okay, now we know our story. We know who we are. That implies what we are to do."
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.440]   Yes. And speaking of stories, how does a Christian leader who understands the redemptive storyline
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:12.360]   of creation, fall, redemption, recreation, how does that story translate into what he
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.360]   does on Monday?
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:19.480]   You know, Tony, I think that's a fantastic question, and it is well answered only partially
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.760]   in terms of anyone trying to take a stab at that. But let me suggest this. I think a part
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.520]   of what the Christian in the business world, you might say even in the secular world, because
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.160]   it would apply to the world of politics or even the world of academia or the cultural
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.520]   creatives, I think a part of what that Christian has to say is, "Look, what we're doing is
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.880]   really important. I'm absolutely convinced this work is important. It's important because
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.720]   in this world, we've been put here for a purpose, and I'm very thankful to have these gifts
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.640]   and this opportunity and to be with you in this endeavor." But at the same time, the
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.960]   Christian leader says, "As important as this is, and as much as we're going to strive for
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.960]   excellence and push ourselves to go beyond where we even could imagine we could go, this
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.600]   is not the most important thing in life." And I think the Christian leader always has
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.200]   to demonstrate that. "My marriage is actually more important to me than this work. My children
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:18.040]   are actually more important to me than a promotion." At the same time, I give myself to a greater
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:23.480]   degree of commitment. I'm invested in this to a greater degree of personal heart, mind,
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:29.120]   and soul because I know that this is important. And the Christian worldview validates the
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:34.560]   importance of work in this world, and the glory of God in the human being made in God's
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:41.360]   image, doing what God has created us to do, to use creative energy, to be driven by visions,
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:47.840]   to use the physical capacity to craft, to manufacture, to create, to use the relational
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:55.720]   gifts to be able to sell, to buy, to bargain, to negotiate. All of these things are validated
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:01.440]   in terms of a biblical worldview that says, "This life we're living right now is not something
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:08.720]   that is just a prelude to real life. This is real life. We're promised an even more
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:14.200]   real richer life in Christ to come, but this life is validated as being important, not
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:19.640]   only to us, but to the Creator who gave us these gifts and gave us life and gave us a
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:20.640]   task."
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:25.680]   Yeah, so every company should be led from a sub-narrative to explain why their services
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.360]   or products matter, but some don't, or at least it's not obvious. I mean, how would
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:34.340]   you counsel a businessman in a corporation that, to be honest, seems to have no compelling
[00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.420]   story to protect? What then?
[00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:42.560]   You know, there is an old Christian theological concept that is important here. It's called
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:48.000]   sphere sovereignty, and it reminds us that we are responsible for that which is put into
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.380]   our care under our stewardship. So one of the things that every Christian in the business
[00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:57.640]   world or the secular world needs to remember is that we're not responsible for the things
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:04.540]   that are beyond our pay grade. If the company we're working for doesn't have a clear grasp
[00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:09.920]   of its story, we're probably unable to reach two or three executive levels above to solve
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:16.360]   that problem. But where we are, where our unit is assigned, the work that is ours, that
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:22.520]   has a story. And we're at least going to be very clear about what our story is. And furthermore,
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:28.160]   we're going to try to help others to understand how important it is to know who we are, why
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:33.320]   we're here, what we're doing, why it matters, and what every group being led wants to know,
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:36.040]   where in the world are we going?
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:39.760]   That was Dr. Albert Moeller by phone from his office. He's the president of the Southern
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:44.520]   Baptist Theological Seminary and author of the book, "The Conviction to Lead, 25 Principles
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:50.640]   for Leadership that Matters." Tomorrow, I'll ask him how we balance conviction, humility,
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:55.360]   and self-confidence in the workplace. I'm your host, Tony Reinke, and I'll see you tomorrow.
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:03.720]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
