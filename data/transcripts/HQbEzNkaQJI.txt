[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520]   I should like to call your attention this evening to the words which are to be found
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.800]   in the Gospel according to St. Luke, in the ninth chapter, and the thirty-fifth verse
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:20.320]   of the Gospel according to St. Luke.
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:45.080]   And there came a voice out of the cloud saying, "This is my beloved Son; hear Him."
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:55.080]   I think the emphasis should be put on both words, "Hear Him, hear Him."
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:03.220]   Now I call your attention this evening to this remarkable incident in the earthly life
[00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:10.720]   and ministry of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, which is generally referred to and
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.120]   described as the Transfiguration.
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.400]   But I want not so much to deal with the great incident itself, though we shall of course
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:29.160]   deal with it, but rather I want to concentrate attention on what we are told in this thirty-fifth
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:40.080]   verse about this voice that came out of the cloud, out of heavens, uttering these momentous
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.320]   and memorable words.
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:52.640]   Now here we have, of course, the very essence of the Christian message.
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.040]   We are accustomed to talk today in terms of pinpointing things.
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:08.040]   Well, here is a verse that pinpoints the very central thing in the Gospel.
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:16.840]   It is a light from heaven itself shining upon it and calling our attention to it.
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.080]   Let us look at it in this way.
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:29.480]   This is a part, of course, of the great message of the whole Bible from beginning to end.
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.960]   We have been considering this biblical message.
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.920]   We were doing so before Christmas, leading up to Christmas.
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.880]   We spent several Sunday nights in the Old Testament, and every time we saw the same
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.840]   thing.
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.600]   This Bible, this book which we call the Bible, is God's Word to men.
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.960]   It is God speaking to men.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.360]   That is what it is all about.
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.600]   And that is why I keep on saying that it is the most relevant book in the world tonight,
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:09.320]   and a book that should be read most urgently by every one of us.
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:16.720]   Every thinking person today must be very gravely and deeply concerned about the position in
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:25.240]   which we find ourselves as a nation, and as one of the great company of nations making
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.680]   up the world.
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.080]   We read in our papers of the grave concern.
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:41.080]   The whole future of this country may be in the balance, industrially I mean.
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:47.280]   Our whole way of life may be in a very precarious position.
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:54.520]   And there are various reasons being put forward for that, and we are all involved in that.
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.280]   But you see, we do not preach about that.
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.360]   We do not offer advice to employers and implied.
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.240]   We do not express our opinions about strikes and things like that.
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.240]   Why?
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:14.840]   Well, simply for this reason, that we do not believe in medicating symptoms.
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.680]   We believe in treating the disease.
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.520]   And the disease is the thing with which the Bible treats.
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.860]   You see, even if there were no problems in this peculiar form in which they are confronting
[00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.000]   us today, the biblical message would still be true.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.600]   It was needed quite as much a hundred years ago, in the halcyon days of the mid-Victorian
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:45.080]   period, when everything seemed to be all right, and when war was almost unthinkable.
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.520]   The Crimean War was just an isolated event, as it were.
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:55.200]   There was that great Pax Britannica, call it what you like, running from the Napoleonic
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.200]   Wars to the War of 1914-1918, and life seemed to be so smooth.
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.980]   But it wasn't, for all who've got eyes to see.
[00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:10.640]   There were things happening then which are responsible for what is happening now.
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:16.640]   For you and I are living in an age which is just reaping what was sown by those who went
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.720]   before us.
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.840]   There were problems which were not faced.
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.600]   Why were they not faced?
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.960]   Because of sin.
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.320]   Because of selfishness.
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.320]   Because of self-centeredness.
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:33.800]   And here we are in our predicament.
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.720]   And the world is in trouble.
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:44.720]   And there's only one word, I say, that speaks to our condition, and that is the word of
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.720]   this book.
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:53.520]   Now, it's no part of the preaching of the gospel, simply to condemn the way in which
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.800]   men and women are living.
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.520]   That gets you nowhere.
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.640]   It's no use going to a poor helpless drunkard and just reading him a lecture on the evil
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.000]   effects of alcohol.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.540]   He probably knows all about it.
[00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.440]   It doesn't help him.
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.800]   And as we see the masses today living a godless and an irreligious life, it's no part of
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.500]   the preaching of the gospel just to make fun of them or to condemn them.
[00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.800]   That doesn't help them, it doesn't help anybody.
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.400]   They're victims, according to the Bible.
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:34.320]   Our business is to show them exactly why they are what they are, and a way of deliverance.
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.840]   It's no use just appealing to people to live a better life.
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:38.840]   That's never worked.
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:44.360]   That's what the world outside the Bible does.
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.380]   That's what your social movements do.
[00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.340]   That's what your cultural movements do.
[00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.580]   That's what philosophy has always done.
[00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.540]   Now the Bible doesn't do that.
[00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:58.440]   The Bible has got a unique message, and it's a radical one.
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:04.900]   And as we've been seeing, its view is this, that man is as he is, and the world is as
[00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:09.300]   it is, because of sin.
[00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:15.000]   Because man does not listen to the voice of God.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.380]   And all the troubles and the calamities have resulted from that.
[00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:21.380]   The fall of man into sin.
[00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:27.140]   But - and this is the message - in spite of that, God hasn't turned his back upon the
[00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:29.380]   world.
[00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:35.940]   From the very moment that man fell, God came to him and began to speak to him.
[00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:39.620]   And we've been spending our Sunday nights in considering the various ways in which God
[00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:40.620]   did that.
[00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:42.300]   We've seen many of them.
[00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:44.140]   He spoke by direct action.
[00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:45.620]   He spoke in history.
[00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:47.460]   He spoke by doing things to them.
[00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:50.660]   He sent a flood and destroyed the world.
[00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:52.780]   He smashed the tower of Babel.
[00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:55.980]   These are historic events.
[00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:57.940]   God was speaking through events.
[00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:05.180]   But he not only spoke through events, he spoke directly to men.
[00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:10.460]   He called a man like Abram, gave him a message, gave him a mandate, if you like, gave him
[00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:12.660]   a program.
[00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:14.940]   He called a man of the name of Moses.
[00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:19.420]   He took him up into a mountain and gave him his holy law and told him to take it down
[00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:21.460]   to the people.
[00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:24.100]   God has been speaking.
[00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:26.060]   God has been addressing men.
[00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:29.500]   And God all along has been really just saying the one thing.
[00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:33.900]   He's been calling men and women back to himself.
[00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:39.780]   He's been urging them to realize that it is because of their alienation from him that
[00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:44.920]   they are in their troubles and that they'll continue in them until they come back to him.
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:50.580]   He's been repeating it from century to century, from generation to generation.
[00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:53.620]   He raised a mighty succession of prophets.
[00:08:53.620 --> 00:09:00.820]   He prepared for himself a nation called the Jews to whom he gave his law and his word.
[00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:03.340]   And through them he's spoken to the whole world.
[00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:06.420]   God has gone on doing this.
[00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:12.500]   And all along I say the message has been just that one message, that it doesn't matter
[00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:21.180]   what you do until you come back to God, nothing will be right.
[00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:25.660]   And you see this message is as urgent this evening as it's ever been.
[00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:30.540]   It's been going on for all these centuries and yet the world is still in trouble.
[00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:31.540]   Why?
[00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:33.540]   Well it simply won't listen.
[00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:38.740]   But this is the amazing thing, and it's the message of this book, that in spite of all
[00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:49.620]   our blindness and our folly, our rebellion, our arrogant refusal, God still goes on speaking.
[00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:53.780]   That's the great story of the Old Testament.
[00:09:53.780 --> 00:10:00.460]   And it's an amazing thing to me how anybody can read it without being struck and moved
[00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:06.500]   by the patience and the long-suffering of God.
[00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:09.780]   What impatient creatures you and I are.
[00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:13.860]   We are prepared perhaps to forgive people a few times but then we reach a point when
[00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:16.300]   we say that person's hopeless.
[00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:18.140]   There we finish with him.
[00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:19.420]   But God has gone on.
[00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:22.260]   Look at his patience with the children of Israel.
[00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:23.260]   Look at his long-suffering.
[00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:28.900]   And you see God is still the same.
[00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:33.180]   Now I say that is the great central message of this book.
[00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:38.420]   And here in this particular statement we're looking at this evening, it's put before us
[00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:42.820]   in a most extraordinary and striking manner.
[00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:47.220]   God has been speaking throughout the centuries, through patriarchs, through kings, through
[00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:52.300]   prophets, through actions.
[00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:57.540]   But here he is now doing a most extraordinary and strange thing.
[00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:06.060]   He speaks from heaven and this is what he says, this, pointing to a solitary person,
[00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:11.180]   this is my beloved son.
[00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:20.220]   Hear him, hear him, listen to him.
[00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:24.140]   That's the message.
[00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:34.260]   Now in other words you see this statement directs us to the person of our Lord and Savior
[00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:38.860]   Jesus Christ.
[00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:43.220]   And this I say is the essence of Christianity.
[00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:45.540]   What is the Christian message?
[00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:50.780]   Well the Christian message is about Jesus Christ.
[00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:58.180]   The whole message of Christianity is really summarized in these two words, hear him.
[00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:03.060]   Now let me put it to you in this form.
[00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:10.020]   The whole position, the whole message, depends upon this person.
[00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:15.180]   You noticed how the Apostle Peter put it when as an old man he wrote that last letter of
[00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:19.140]   his to a certain number of Christian people.
[00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:25.940]   He says, "We have not followed cunningly devised fables when we have spoken unto you
[00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:33.420]   about his coming and his glory, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.
[00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:37.860]   And when we were with him," he says, "in the holy mount, we heard that voice from the
[00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:44.660]   excellent glory saying."
[00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:50.740]   Now all that being interpreted in modern language can be put in this form.
[00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:55.740]   Christianity is entirely about this person.
[00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:58.820]   It is to tell men and women about him.
[00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:00.900]   It is to call their attention to him.
[00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:08.620]   It's to ask them to listen to him, to come to him, and to listen to him and to obey him.
[00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:12.620]   I wonder whether we're all clear about that.
[00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:18.580]   It seems to me that there are many still who confuse Christianity and cunningly devised
[00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:22.220]   fables.
[00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:28.380]   There are still some who seem to regard the whole thing as a sort of myth.
[00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:32.100]   What I mean by that is that they say, "Oh, well, these facts, of course, don't matter.
[00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:34.180]   We are now so learned and so clever.
[00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:38.740]   We know that these things didn't happen, but after all, we believe in certain principles
[00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:40.140]   and in certain teachings."
[00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:43.420]   They say, "These stories are myths.
[00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:49.380]   We believe in the essential teaching."
[00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:55.980]   But as I see it, that's the very antithesis of Christianity.
[00:13:55.980 --> 00:14:00.340]   This isn't a matter of cunningly devised fables.
[00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:04.140]   This is a question of facts.
[00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:08.100]   In other words, Christianity isn't a teaching.
[00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:12.020]   It isn't just another of the philosophies.
[00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:16.100]   It isn't just another idea about life and how it's to be lived and what's to be done
[00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:17.940]   about it.
[00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:20.300]   It isn't good advice.
[00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:23.620]   It isn't primarily an appeal to us to do anything at all.
[00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:28.540]   Now we're at the beginning of a year still, and I prophesied last Sunday night that no
[00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:33.660]   doubt many in the name of Christianity would simply be giving good advice to this nation
[00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:36.340]   and to the people, and I was a true prophet.
[00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:38.220]   I did it.
[00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:43.660]   But that's not Christianity.
[00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:47.540]   The business of Christianity, I say, is not just to tell people how to live and how to
[00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:53.020]   pull together and to believe in peace and to talk a lot about the atomic bomb and things
[00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:54.020]   like that.
[00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:55.020]   Not at all.
[00:14:55.020 --> 00:15:02.860]   It's to talk about Jesus Christ, this person on the mountain who suddenly was transfigured
[00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:08.580]   and his very clothing began to shine with a brightness beyond the shining of the sun
[00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:13.060]   itself and in such a manner that no fuller on earth can whiten them.
[00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:14.060]   That's what we are told.
[00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:18.620]   It's all about that.
[00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:22.100]   The world is full of good advice.
[00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:27.420]   The world is full of its moralities and its philosophies and all its teachings and all
[00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:33.220]   its methods and all its schemes.
[00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:34.940]   But that's not Christianity.
[00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:38.660]   Christianity is Christ, this person.
[00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:52.220]   This, says the voice of God from heaven, this, this person, God calls attention to him.
[00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:58.500]   In other words, my dear friends, the whole subject before us is this historic person,
[00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:03.980]   Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:08.140]   Now you notice when you read the book of the Acts of the Apostles that they who were the
[00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:14.300]   first preachers, after all, and to whom we have as our only pattern and standard, when
[00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:16.700]   they went around preaching, what did they do?
[00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:22.260]   Well, they preached Jesus, Jesus and the resurrection.
[00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:23.660]   That was their sermon.
[00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:26.660]   They spoke about him.
[00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:31.540]   I defy you as you turn to that book of the Acts of the Apostles to see any one of those
[00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:36.820]   preachers inciting the people to sign petitions and to send them up to the government at Rome
[00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:41.580]   or to ask for this reform or to see that certain action was taken by the senators.
[00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:46.340]   Not a word.
[00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:48.340]   What were these apostles?
[00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:53.620]   Well, they were witnesses to Jesus Christ.
[00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:56.900]   That's what he calls them himself.
[00:16:56.900 --> 00:17:00.580]   After his resurrection and before he ascended into heaven, he gathered them together and
[00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:07.820]   he said, look here, stay where you are in Jerusalem until the Holy Ghost shall come
[00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:09.380]   upon you.
[00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:17.860]   And then you shall be witnesses unto me in Jerusalem and in Samaria and unto the utmost
[00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:20.180]   parts of the earth.
[00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:23.620]   Witnesses unto me.
[00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:27.540]   And they listened to him and they obeyed him and in ten days' time the Holy Ghost came
[00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:32.100]   upon them and they were filled with a new spirit and a new power.
[00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:33.580]   And Peter begins to speak.
[00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:35.040]   And what does he speak about?
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:40.980]   He speaks about Jesus Christ.
[00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:44.500]   That's his message, that's his good news.
[00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:47.580]   He doesn't merely offer good advice to the people of Jerusalem.
[00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:52.780]   He talks about this person whom you, he said, have taken with cruel hands and have crucified
[00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:53.780]   him.
[00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:55.060]   You've killed the Prince of Life.
[00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:56.420]   You didn't know what you were doing.
[00:17:56.420 --> 00:18:01.380]   He speaks about Jesus.
[00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:04.660]   And so do they all.
[00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:10.100]   It's their one message everywhere because it is the greatest message in the world, the
[00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:14.620]   profoundest message, the most momentous message, the most urgent message.
[00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:19.020]   Here is something which the world has never known before.
[00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:24.140]   This is my beloved Son.
[00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:26.380]   Hear him.
[00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:31.100]   In other words, those first preachers went round and they spoke about him and they said,
[00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:36.220]   He sent us out, it is he who has commissioned us and he has told us to go and bear witness
[00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:41.220]   unto him, to tell you what he did while he was here, how he died, how he rose again,
[00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:42.820]   how he sent this spirit.
[00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:47.740]   That's our message, nothing else.
[00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:55.140]   He sent them out to preach and he told them to preach about him.
[00:18:55.140 --> 00:19:01.380]   We shall be witnesses unto me.
[00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:04.020]   God has already witnessed this.
[00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:09.260]   You be witnesses unto me.
[00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:13.660]   And therefore what they did was to go round and they repeated these words that came out
[00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:16.500]   of the cloud, out of the excellent glory.
[00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:24.940]   They pleaded with men and women to listen, to hear him.
[00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:29.940]   And that is what I have to say to you this evening.
[00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:32.860]   Are you in trouble?
[00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:40.380]   Are you distressed about yourself or about the world or about someone else?
[00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:43.540]   Are you finding life hard and almost unendurable?
[00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:51.300]   Well, the message, whatever your condition is this, hear him.
[00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:54.780]   Have you come into this service pleased with yourself and self-satisfied?
[00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:59.980]   I say it still more to you, hear him.
[00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:07.140]   Whatever your state or condition, the message is still needed and the message is always,
[00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:08.140]   hear him.
[00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:12.700]   Well, says someone, why should I hear him?
[00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:14.980]   Why should I listen unto him?
[00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:17.140]   What reasons can he give me for doing so?
[00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:22.660]   Well, let me suggest some to you.
[00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:31.020]   Hear him because he is who he is.
[00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:41.020]   This is my beloved son, this, Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:43.860]   Is not this the carpenter's son?
[00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:47.420]   Is not this the son of Joseph and Mary whom we know?
[00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:51.180]   Isn't this the fellow who started preaching, who has never been to the schools?
[00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:53.220]   Who is this?
[00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:58.980]   That's what men ask, that's what they said.
[00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:07.060]   But here comes a voice out of the excellent glory, out of heaven itself, and the voice
[00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:13.260]   says this is my beloved son.
[00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:19.060]   Now my friends, the whole of Christianity depends upon this.
[00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:23.140]   That is why Peter, you see, as an old man wrote in that particular way, he says I know
[00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:27.060]   that my life in this world is not going to be extended much longer.
[00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:32.100]   I've got to put off this tabernacle I'm going, but I want you to remember after I've gone
[00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:34.620]   the things I've said to you.
[00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:39.180]   And what I've said to you is this, is to hold on to him and to listen to him and to follow
[00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:40.180]   him.
[00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:41.180]   Why?
[00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:45.340]   Well, because we didn't follow cunningly devised fables when we spoke to you about him.
[00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:52.540]   And since Peter, I was with him on the holy mount.
[00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:59.540]   And our whole position this evening depends upon the witness of the apostles.
[00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:02.580]   Let's be quite clear about that.
[00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:06.140]   Christianity is an historical religion.
[00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:11.140]   That's why it's so different from Mohammedanism and Hinduism and Confucianism and all the
[00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:12.140]   rest of them.
[00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:15.780]   They're not historical religions, they're philosophies, they're teachings.
[00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:24.860]   The whole case here depends upon a series of historical events and facts.
[00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:38.580]   The holy mount, says Peter, I was there, I listened, I heard, I'm a witness to it.
[00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:45.420]   And this therefore is the most astounding thing that the world can hear tonight.
[00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:53.580]   That God's only begotten son has been in this world.
[00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:55.020]   That's the message of Christianity.
[00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:58.660]   Have you any proofs of it, says someone?
[00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:03.620]   Well, yes, I start with this very proof that is given here, the thing that Peter reduces.
[00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:11.460]   There he is, look at him, Jesus of Nazareth, born in that stable, you remember, in Bethlehem
[00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:14.860]   and put in the manger.
[00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:20.620]   This astonishing boy that could refute and confute and confound the doctors of the law
[00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:27.900]   at the age of twelve, the carpenter of Nazareth.
[00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:32.300]   The man who began to preach at the age of thirty.
[00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:39.100]   There he is, and this is what I see happening to him.
[00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:46.540]   As he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and
[00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:49.220]   glistening.
[00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:53.500]   Some of these other evangelists describe it in a still more striking form.
[00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:59.340]   They give us more of the details of what happened to him there.
[00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:06.220]   For instance, they say things like this, "He was transfigured before them, and his face
[00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:13.420]   did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light."
[00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:17.540]   Now this happened in the presence of Peter and James and John, you remember.
[00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:19.900]   Our Lord took them up onto the mountain.
[00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:23.500]   They'd been following him, they'd listened to him, they'd heard his words, they'd seen
[00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:26.780]   his miracles, and they were in doubts about him.
[00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:32.140]   Peter at Caesarea Philippi just before had answered the question when Christ asked him,
[00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:34.460]   "Well, whom do you say that I am?"
[00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:41.500]   Peter said, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God."
[00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:46.740]   But still they were not clear about it, because a few minutes later he'd said to them, "The
[00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:48.780]   Son of Man must be put to death."
[00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:52.540]   And Peter said, "Far be this from thee, Lord," and had to be rebuked.
[00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:56.140]   And the Lord said to him, "Get thee behind me, Satan."
[00:24:56.140 --> 00:25:00.620]   The Holy Spirit had revealed it to him, "Flesh and blood hath not revealed this unto thee,
[00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:04.340]   but my Father which is in heaven," says Christ to him.
[00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:08.500]   Peter thinks he knows, he doesn't, he doesn't understand, and they go up with him onto the
[00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:09.500]   mountain.
[00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:16.300]   There they watch him kneeling in prayer, and suddenly he's transfigured.
[00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:23.380]   And a light such as never was on sea nor land begins to stream not only from his face, but
[00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:25.940]   from his very clothing.
[00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:29.220]   He was transfigured before them.
[00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:34.860]   And then to their amazement they see Moses and Elias speaking to him.
[00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:40.860]   They had come out of the glory, they'd been dead for centuries, but here they are, they're
[00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:46.620]   speaking to him, and obviously speaking with deference.
[00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:50.780]   They look up to him, as it were, and they speak to him about his death that he's going
[00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:51.780]   to accomplish.
[00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:54.980]   Who is this?
[00:25:54.980 --> 00:26:00.740]   This Jesus, this carpenter, this person, this human being, as it were, what is this that's
[00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:05.580]   happening to him, and why do these come out of the glory in order to speak to him?
[00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:06.580]   Who is he?
[00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:19.980]   And there's only one answer to the question, "This is my beloved son."
[00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:23.180]   That voice spoke about him in the same manner on other occasions.
[00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:32.540]   You remember at his baptism, "This is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased."
[00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:37.980]   The voice of God, the voice of heaven, Peter vouches for it, he says, "I was there, I
[00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:40.980]   heard it.
[00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:46.940]   I wasn't speaking at random, I wasn't merely pitching tales in my mind and trying to interest
[00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:56.220]   you, I wasn't holding myths before you, I was there, I saw it, I saw him."
[00:26:56.220 --> 00:27:00.700]   But then as he goes on to say in that epistle, "It isn't only dependent upon that, there
[00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:04.780]   is the word of prophecy made more sure.
[00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:08.980]   You needn't base it all only upon my word and upon my testimony," says Peter.
[00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:14.460]   "I was there, I did see it, but listen, go back to your Old Testament, read your prophets,
[00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:15.700]   and see what's happened.
[00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:18.660]   The prophecies have been fulfilled.
[00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:21.220]   Read the prophecies about the coming Messiah.
[00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:22.220]   Where is he to be born?
[00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:24.100]   Micah says it's in Bethlehem.
[00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:26.180]   He was born in Bethlehem.
[00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:27.180]   What is he to be like?
[00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:30.500]   Well, he's to be a wonderful counselor.
[00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:35.140]   Take all the details one by one and work them out, and you'll find that he fulfills them
[00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:42.540]   every one, his birth, his life, his miracles, his death.
[00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:45.660]   He was despised.
[00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:48.100]   He was rejected of men.
[00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:50.700]   He was led as a lamb to the slaughter.
[00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:56.100]   He made his grave with the rich.
[00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:59.700]   It's all been literally fulfilled.
[00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:01.700]   Don't merely base it on me," says Peter.
[00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:04.420]   "You have the word of prophecy made more sure.
[00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:06.020]   Read your prophets.
[00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:13.260]   See the fulfillment."
[00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:17.700]   And then, in addition to all that, you've got these records of his life in the four
[00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:24.180]   gospels, his words, his works.
[00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:27.500]   Who is this?
[00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:28.500]   Is he merely a carpenter?
[00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:29.500]   Is he merely a man?
[00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:34.780]   Can you account for the persistence of Christianity and of the Church if that is so?
[00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:37.780]   Here's the evidence.
[00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:45.260]   This, attested by God himself in a most signal manner.
[00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:51.300]   Very well, then, the message of Christianity is this.
[00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:53.900]   "This is my beloved Son."
[00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:57.580]   "But have you nothing further by way of proof," says someone.
[00:28:57.580 --> 00:29:00.020]   "Well, yes, I have.
[00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:05.260]   And perhaps the greatest proof of all.
[00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:12.580]   Cruel men hated him, the Pharisees and the scribes and the Sadducees and the doctors
[00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:15.700]   of the law particularly.
[00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:19.660]   This upstart, this imposter.
[00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:23.820]   And they so hated him that they conspired to put him to death and they succeeded in
[00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:30.180]   persuading the rebel to shout out away with him, 'Crucify him, give us Barabbas.'
[00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:34.500]   So they took him and they condemned him and they crucified him and he died and they took
[00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:40.580]   down the body and they placed it in a grave and rolled a stone over it and sealed it and
[00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:44.740]   put soldiers to guard it.
[00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:51.220]   And yet on the morning of the third day when the women and others went there to see what
[00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:57.420]   his body was like, they found the tomb was empty, the stone was rolled away and the body
[00:29:57.420 --> 00:29:58.420]   had disappeared.
[00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:01.340]   The grave clothes were left but he'd gone.
[00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:04.060]   The resurrection?
[00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:09.180]   And he appeared unto these chosen witnesses for forty days and then they saw him ascending
[00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:15.180]   unto heaven, the resurrection, declared to be the Son of God with power according to
[00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:19.140]   the Spirit of holiness by the resurrection from the dead.
[00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:23.620]   He's risen, this is the evidence.
[00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:27.460]   And it was because of this these men went round and preached him.
[00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:28.460]   What's it mean?
[00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:40.380]   It means this, 'Into this world of sin and shame, of trouble and of confusion, God the
[00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:45.700]   eternal Son has come.'
[00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:50.060]   That's the message, that's my message tonight.
[00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:53.700]   I know just a little bit about history.
[00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:57.260]   We've been going through the Old Testament history, we could have gone outside it, we
[00:30:57.260 --> 00:31:02.140]   could have dealt with the secular history, we could have treated of the rising of the
[00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:10.740]   various great dynasties, Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, Rome, we're aware of certain of the
[00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:15.460]   facts and we could have talked about that and we could have said, 'Now this is interesting,
[00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:18.860]   here is men's predicament, what have been the attempts, what have been the attempts
[00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:19.860]   to solve it?
[00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:25.340]   There have been great chieftains, great princes, great warriors, great thinkers and philosophers
[00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:31.660]   and this is what they've said, but the world is still the same.'
[00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:36.700]   But that isn't our message.
[00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:46.020]   Our message is just to say that nearly two thousand years ago, God sent his own Son into
[00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:47.020]   the world.
[00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:54.740]   All others have been men, all others have been but human beings, the great philosopher,
[00:31:54.740 --> 00:32:00.820]   the great king, the great captain, the great warrior, men, great men, many of them, yes
[00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:15.780]   but here is someone different, this is my beloved Son, God in the flesh, God-man.
[00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:18.740]   God has done something about the world and its predicament.
[00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:25.700]   God has sent his own Son into it.
[00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:32.180]   That is why it's important for you and for me to listen to him.
[00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:40.220]   Amidst all the babel of vices that are confusing wisdom in the world tonight, isn't this the
[00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:45.220]   supreme tragedy that men and women are not listening to him?
[00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:51.860]   There he is, he's been in the world and he has spoken and God has said, 'Listen to him,
[00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:57.220]   hear him,' and men and women are listening to everything else.
[00:32:57.220 --> 00:33:02.580]   And the confusion continues and the desperation increases.
[00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:10.380]   'Hear him, my friend, here is not a man, here is God-man, here is God the eternal Son, come
[00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:15.380]   down amongst us, here is one who has come out of the everlasting bosom and has taken
[00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:19.540]   on human nature and has lived as a man amongst men.
[00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:26.460]   It's God speaking.'
[00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:30.300]   That in itself is sufficient reason for us to listen to him.
[00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:32.700]   But let me tell you something else.
[00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:42.020]   'Hear him because of what he says and because of what he does.'
[00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:43.020]   What does he say?
[00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:49.220]   Well, he says, 'I am the light of the world.'
[00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:51.380]   He doesn't hesitate to say it.
[00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:57.180]   'I am the light of the world.'
[00:33:57.180 --> 00:34:01.060]   We know about the darkness, don't we?
[00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:05.180]   But the great quest of men is for the light.
[00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:06.180]   Where can it be found?
[00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:12.220]   The light on my own personal problems, the light on moral problems, the light on the
[00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:13.220]   whole problem of men.
[00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:14.220]   Light, where is it?
[00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:16.900]   Where can it be found?
[00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:22.060]   He says, 'I am the light of the world.
[00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:33.460]   He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.'
[00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:40.500]   Listen to him again and you'll hear him saying this, 'The Son of Man is come to seek and
[00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:46.620]   to save that which was lost.'
[00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:48.460]   Lost.
[00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:51.380]   He means it's gone astray and it can't find its way back.
[00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:53.940]   He doesn't know where it is nor what to do.
[00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:54.940]   Lost.
[00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:56.340]   Like a sheep, he says.
[00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:59.540]   He paints a picture in a parable of a lost sheep.
[00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:01.580]   Ninety-nine are all right.
[00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:05.180]   One has gone away and wandered into a wilderness and can't get back.
[00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:11.380]   The Son of Man is come to seek and to save that which is lost.
[00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:20.900]   Lost its bearings, lost its sense of direction, lost its understanding, lost hope, lost everything.
[00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:28.340]   Here's a good reason for hearing him, isn't it?
[00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:32.780]   Here's a wonderful reason for listening to him.
[00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:39.820]   Are you lost in confusion, not knowing what to make of yourself or to do with yourself?
[00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:45.460]   That's what he says, 'The Son of Man is come to seek and to save that which is lost.'
[00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:49.460]   Listen to him again.
[00:35:49.460 --> 00:36:03.580]   He says, 'Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.'
[00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:05.620]   You know what he's talking about?
[00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:17.780]   All ye that labour and are heavy laden, staggering along under a load of sin, under anxieties
[00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:24.300]   and troubles and problems, labour and are heavy laden.
[00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:29.900]   Come unto me, he says, and I will give you rest.
[00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:38.180]   Take my yoke upon you and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly of heart, and ye shall
[00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:48.020]   find rest unto your souls, for my yoke is easy and my burden is light.'
[00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:52.940]   What a wonderful reason for listening to him.
[00:36:52.940 --> 00:37:04.540]   But again I hear him saying, 'I came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance,
[00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:09.140]   for they that are whole have no need of a physician, but they that are sick.'
[00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:13.260]   Oh, do you know what he's talking about?
[00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:18.140]   I came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.
[00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:22.420]   You know what sin is, don't you?
[00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:28.940]   Is there anybody who can speak to you when you're being lashed by an accusing conscience?
[00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:35.900]   Have you discovered the mystic secret of how to silence your conscience when it points
[00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:40.340]   its finger at you and reminds you of your past and what you've been and what you've
[00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:41.340]   done?
[00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:42.340]   Do you know the way of?
[00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:44.940]   Is there anybody who can deliver you?
[00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:46.420]   Listen to him.
[00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:54.620]   He has come to call sinners to repentance, and he was known as the friend of publicans
[00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:55.620]   and of sinners.
[00:37:55.620 --> 00:38:02.580]   But listen, he says this also, 'I am the way and the truth and the life.
[00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:06.860]   No man cometh unto the Father but by me.'
[00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:12.100]   Have you begun to realize that what your greatest need is your need of God?
[00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:17.860]   To know God, to be able to pray to God, to be strengthened by God, to be blessed by God,
[00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:21.860]   to find God?
[00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:31.860]   Well if you have, don't waste your time with anybody else, because he says that 'no
[00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:36.820]   man cometh unto the Father but by me.'
[00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:39.140]   Ah, you believe in God.
[00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:42.600]   You believe in God as creator and sustainer of the world.
[00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:50.740]   You believe in God as a great power, but tell me, do you know God as your Father?
[00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:56.580]   You'll never know him as Father except in and through Jesus Christ.
[00:38:56.580 --> 00:39:00.220]   That's why the Father said, 'This is my beloved Son, hear him.
[00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:03.900]   No man cometh to the Father, he says, but by me.'
[00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:05.460]   Those are some of his words.
[00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:11.060]   We'll consider others on some future occasion.
[00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:14.460]   But here are some other reasons for listening to him and for hearing him.
[00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:16.580]   Look at what he did.
[00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:21.780]   Read your Gospels, my dear friend, and see them, the lame and the blind and the halt
[00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:26.060]   and the deaf and the leprous and even the dead.
[00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:37.900]   He speaks and listening to his voice, new life the dead receive.
[00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:41.100]   Go through the records.
[00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:53.420]   Look at them, weary and worn and sad, crippled by disease, outcasts from society, deaf, blind
[00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:55.460]   every conceivable thing.
[00:39:55.460 --> 00:40:00.140]   He speaks.
[00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:03.500]   He can even silence a storm at sea.
[00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:08.940]   He can rebuke the wind and the waves, and they have to listen.
[00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:13.060]   Hear him, my friend.
[00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:17.900]   Oh, those were the things that he did in his life, but consider what he's been doing since
[00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:21.700]   his death and since his resurrection and since his ascension.
[00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:26.260]   Listen to him, says the voice from heaven, hear him.
[00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:27.260]   Why?
[00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:30.740]   Well, look what he did to the apostles.
[00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:35.340]   Look at a man like this Simon Peter, whose epistle we read just now.
[00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:42.540]   Look at him, the self-confident, the man so full of braggadocio, the man of supreme self-confidence,
[00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:49.940]   the impulsive Peter, and yet weak as water.
[00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:55.580]   The man who says one moment, though all desert thee, I will never desert thee, even if it
[00:40:55.580 --> 00:40:58.060]   means going through death with thee.
[00:40:58.060 --> 00:41:03.020]   And yet in a few hours, a servant girl challenges him and says, aren't you from Galilee?
[00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:04.020]   Don't you belong to him?
[00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:11.580]   And he said, no, he denied him three times with oaths and cursings.
[00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:21.220]   That's the sort of man Simon Peter was, a blunderer, a braggart, a muddle-thinker who
[00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:27.580]   didn't understand, has his flashes and then loses them.
[00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:30.200]   But look at him in the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:32.660]   Look at him in his epistles.
[00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:36.700]   Read the story of the man and see the transformation.
[00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:43.060]   He becomes a new man, speaks with boldness even in Jerusalem, in spite of all the authorities,
[00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:56.500]   defies them, becomes a rock, stable and dependable, bold and fearless, a man who gladly died for
[00:41:56.500 --> 00:42:01.060]   the name of Christ later on.
[00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:03.180]   What is it that made the difference to him?
[00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:06.020]   There's only one answer.
[00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:11.180]   He obeyed what God said from the excellent glory on the Mount of Transfigurations.
[00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:13.340]   He heard Christ.
[00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:14.540]   He listened to him.
[00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:15.940]   He obeyed him.
[00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:21.940]   He went after him, and this is what Christ did to him.
[00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:26.740]   And he did the same to Saul of Tarsus.
[00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:34.500]   There he meets him on the road, and he hears the words, "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou
[00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:35.500]   me?"
[00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:42.100]   And baffled and bewildered and amazed, he says, "Who art thou, Lord?"
[00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:46.820]   And back came the answer, "I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.
[00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:48.900]   It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks."
[00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:49.900]   And Paul heard him.
[00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:50.900]   He listened to him.
[00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:51.900]   He believed him.
[00:42:51.900 --> 00:43:02.800]   And the blaspheming Pharisee becomes the great apostle to the Gentiles, the new men in Christ
[00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:03.800]   Jesus.
[00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:07.280]   That's what happens when you listen to him, and it's been the same ever since.
[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:12.740]   I could take you down the centuries and pick out the great mighty men of God that stand
[00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:14.940]   out like mighty mountain peaks.
[00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:15.940]   And what's their secret?
[00:43:15.940 --> 00:43:16.940]   Well, they've heard him.
[00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:27.900]   That was, you remember, precisely the very method by which the great Augustine of Hippo
[00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:32.220]   was converted.
[00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:41.540]   That great outstanding genius, that brilliant philosopher, who nevertheless was living an
[00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:44.820]   immoral life and kept his mistress.
[00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:47.020]   And he gets troubled, he is disturbed.
[00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:50.940]   He's been listening to Christian preaching, and the conflict begins.
[00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:52.580]   And he doesn't know what to do with himself.
[00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:53.580]   He's wretched.
[00:43:53.580 --> 00:44:00.100]   He sits in the garden, and suddenly, in his desperation, he hears the voice, "Rise and
[00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:01.100]   read."
[00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:05.540]   And he rushes into the house, and he picks up the book, and there it is, in the 13th
[00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:10.980]   of Romans, "Not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness."
[00:44:10.980 --> 00:44:21.220]   But put it all off and make no provision for the flesh.
[00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:25.420]   And he heard, and he listened, and he obeyed.
[00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:28.860]   And he became that great doctor in the Christian church.
[00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:30.220]   That's what's happened to all of them.
[00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:37.820]   Come down, Luther, Calvary, Knox, Whitefield, and the Wesleys, the Puritans, and all the
[00:44:37.820 --> 00:44:38.820]   rest.
[00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:39.820]   Here's their secret.
[00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:44.580]   They've listened to him, they've heard him, they've believed him to be the Son of God,
[00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:45.580]   and they've gone after him.
[00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:47.500]   That's the reason for listening to him.
[00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:50.940]   Well, then I end with this final reason.
[00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:58.340]   "Hear him," says the voice of God.
[00:44:58.340 --> 00:45:03.860]   And the final reason for obeying is this.
[00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:11.900]   He is God's beloved Son, but he is also God's last word.
[00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:19.140]   Moses and Elias there appear and speak with him on the Mount of Transfiguration.
[00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:20.140]   Who are they?
[00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:26.580]   They're the representatives of the Old Testament, the law and the prophets.
[00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:27.860]   And what did they talk about?
[00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:29.860]   They all talked about him.
[00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:33.740]   "Moses spoke about me," he says.
[00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:35.940]   He said, "Another prophet will arise."
[00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:39.940]   Elias, the first of the prophets, what are they speaking about?
[00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:45.860]   Well, they're speaking about him.
[00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:54.500]   They all point forward to him, but he doesn't point forward.
[00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:57.900]   He points to himself.
[00:45:57.900 --> 00:46:00.940]   He says, "Come unto me."
[00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:04.980]   He doesn't say, as they said, "Wait until the Messiah comes."
[00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:09.340]   He says, "I that speak unto thee, am he.
[00:46:09.340 --> 00:46:10.340]   Come unto me."
[00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:19.380]   "Ye have heard that it has been said by them of old time, but I say unto you."
[00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:24.260]   That's his speech.
[00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:28.940]   I say it with reverence.
[00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:33.740]   Even the Holy Spirit speaks about him.
[00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:38.140]   The Holy Spirit doesn't speak about himself.
[00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:41.900]   He glorifies Christ.
[00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:43.260]   Our Lord said he would.
[00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:46.260]   He said, "He shall glorify me."
[00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:48.020]   He points back to him.
[00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:54.340]   He was sent to illuminate him, to enable these men to bear witness unto him, and he opens
[00:46:54.340 --> 00:46:59.860]   our eyes to see him.
[00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:04.180]   What you need, my friend, is not a vision or some ecstasy or some wonderful feeling
[00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:05.900]   inside you.
[00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:12.580]   What you need is to see and to hear Jesus Christ.
[00:47:12.580 --> 00:47:15.280]   He's God's last word.
[00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:19.780]   No longer prophets and kings and patriarchs and seers.
[00:47:19.780 --> 00:47:30.500]   God sends his own Son, "I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end."
[00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:36.140]   That is what makes the preaching of the gospel so urgent this evening.
[00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:47.220]   If this world should last another thousand years, it will never be offered anything beyond
[00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:50.980]   Jesus Christ.
[00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:55.500]   God has spoken finally in him.
[00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:59.980]   Every other kingdom can be shaken and has been shaken.
[00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:02.300]   Here is a kingdom that cannot be shaken.
[00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:04.220]   It's an everlasting kingdom.
[00:48:04.220 --> 00:48:06.860]   It's an everlasting gospel.
[00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:09.500]   Let the world go on and roll on.
[00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:11.580]   Let fresh discoveries be made.
[00:48:11.580 --> 00:48:15.620]   Let men become still more wonderful with all his science.
[00:48:15.620 --> 00:48:26.660]   The world will remain as it is, and there will be nothing offered except him, this.
[00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:32.980]   He is God's last word to men.
[00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:35.460]   Nothing after Christ.
[00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:38.860]   Nothing beyond Christ.
[00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:46.820]   Because in him, God has given his own Son, has given himself.
[00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:54.500]   And therefore I say to you this evening, that if you don't listen to this Son of God, you
[00:48:54.500 --> 00:49:03.060]   will continue as you are, you will die in your sins, and you will go to hell.
[00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:08.140]   Which means a continuation of what you are now, but much worse, because there will be
[00:49:08.140 --> 00:49:09.140]   no hope.
[00:49:09.140 --> 00:49:14.100]   What's written over the portals of hell, according to Dante, is this, "All ye that
[00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:21.100]   enter here, abandon hope."
[00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:27.420]   The Son of God himself has said that there is a great gulf fixed, eternally fixed, between
[00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:33.740]   heaven and hell.
[00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:39.740]   And as long as the world does not listen to him, it will continue as it is.
[00:49:39.740 --> 00:49:45.980]   There is no hope, isn't it obvious, that there is no hope apart from him.
[00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:49.820]   But in him, there is eternal hope.
[00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:54.500]   My dear friend, I can't let you go, therefore, without asking you a simple question, as I
[00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:57.860]   conclude.
[00:49:57.860 --> 00:50:02.580]   Have you heard him?
[00:50:02.580 --> 00:50:06.100]   Have you listened to him?
[00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:11.180]   Have you heard what he's got to say about a self-righteous, proud Pharisee?
[00:50:11.180 --> 00:50:15.380]   Have you heard what he's got to say about people who rely on their good lives and all
[00:50:15.380 --> 00:50:17.060]   the wonderful things they do?
[00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:20.900]   He condemns them with withering scorn.
[00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:28.500]   Have you heard him?
[00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:32.620]   Are you still in your sins?
[00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:37.740]   Are you still mastered by them and controlled by the devil?
[00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:42.980]   If you are, you haven't heard him, because if you hear him and listen to him, you'll
[00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:44.500]   be delivered from that.
[00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:48.380]   Not that you'll become sinless and perfect, but you'll no longer be under the dominion
[00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:53.180]   of the devil.
[00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:55.500]   Are you weary and heavy-laden?
[00:50:55.500 --> 00:51:04.700]   Well, if you are, it must be that you're not listening to him, because if you listen to
[00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:09.460]   him, you'll have rest.
[00:51:09.460 --> 00:51:12.820]   Are you afraid of death and the grave?
[00:51:12.820 --> 00:51:14.700]   Are you horrified at the thought of them?
[00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:22.460]   If so, you haven't heard him, because you know he's taken the sting out of death, and
[00:51:22.460 --> 00:51:26.500]   he can enable us to smile in the very face of death.
[00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:27.500]   Have you heard him?
[00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:35.420]   Oh, I'll put it in a final word in this way.
[00:51:35.420 --> 00:51:38.660]   This is what he says to all.
[00:51:38.660 --> 00:51:51.660]   "If any man will be my disciple, let him deny himself and take up the cross and follow
[00:51:51.660 --> 00:51:55.060]   me."
[00:51:55.060 --> 00:51:57.700]   Do you know that your sins are forgiven?
[00:51:57.700 --> 00:52:03.420]   If you don't, you haven't heard him, because what he says is this, that though you may
[00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:08.700]   have sinned to the very dregs, that he has died for your sins.
[00:52:08.700 --> 00:52:12.540]   If you say, "But I'm not good enough," you haven't heard him.
[00:52:12.540 --> 00:52:17.620]   He tells you that he's come to die for people who are not good enough.
[00:52:17.620 --> 00:52:28.060]   The Son of Man has come, he says, not to be ministered unto, but to minister and to give
[00:52:28.060 --> 00:52:32.620]   his life a ransom for many.
[00:52:32.620 --> 00:52:36.580]   He has come, the Good Shepherd, to lay down his life for the sheep.
[00:52:36.580 --> 00:52:37.580]   Have you heard him?
[00:52:37.580 --> 00:52:42.740]   Have you heard him telling you that he's died for you, died for your sins?
[00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:52.140]   Oh, if you've heard him, rejoice in salvation, rejoice in sins forgiven.
[00:52:52.140 --> 00:53:00.100]   Have you heard him telling you that he has come to deliver his people from their sins?
[00:53:00.100 --> 00:53:02.540]   Are you being delivered?
[00:53:02.540 --> 00:53:04.020]   Are you delivered from that self-centeredness?
[00:53:04.020 --> 00:53:10.300]   "Deny yourself," he says, "take up the cross," doesn't matter what the world says, "and follow
[00:53:10.300 --> 00:53:12.020]   me."
[00:53:12.020 --> 00:53:14.860]   Have you gone after him?
[00:53:14.860 --> 00:53:21.340]   Is it your supreme desire tonight to know him and to walk closely with him?
[00:53:21.340 --> 00:53:24.940]   Wouldn't you like to live as he lived and go through this world as he went?
[00:53:24.940 --> 00:53:26.700]   He invites you to do it.
[00:53:26.700 --> 00:53:27.700]   Have you heard him?
[00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:28.700]   "Come," he says, "follow me."
[00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:34.100]   "Rise up, my brothers, follow me."
[00:53:34.100 --> 00:53:44.020]   Hear him this evening, the Son of God, the Savior of your soul.
[00:53:44.020 --> 00:53:56.340]   Do you hear the voice from the excellent glory at this moment saying to you, "This is my
[00:53:56.340 --> 00:54:00.220]   beloved Son."
[00:54:00.220 --> 00:54:05.420]   Hear him, hear him.
[00:54:05.420 --> 00:54:08.500]   Do what he tells you.
[00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:11.500]   Go after him.
[00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:13.100]   Amen.
[00:54:13.100 --> 00:54:18.940]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
