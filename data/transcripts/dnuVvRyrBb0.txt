[00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.960]   - In 1946, Eisenhower said,
[00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:07.160]   "I hate war, as only a soldier who has lived at Cannes,
[00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.280]   only as one who has seen its brutality,
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.240]   its futility, its stupidity.
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.680]   Possibly my hatred of war blinds me
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.200]   so that I cannot comprehend the arguments they adduce.
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.680]   But, in my opinion, there's no such thing
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.040]   as a preventative war.
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.320]   Although the suggestion is repeatedly made,
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.520]   none has yet explained how war prevents war.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.360]   Worse than this, no one has been able
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.040]   to explain away the fact that war
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.920]   creates the conditions that beget war."
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.800]   And finally, an excerpt from Eisenhower's farewell address
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.440]   in 1961 on the military industrial complex.
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.000]   "A vital element in keeping the peace
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.320]   is our military establishment.
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.480]   Our arms must be mighty, ready for instant action,
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.520]   so that no potential aggressor may be tempted
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.960]   to risk his own destruction."
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.600]   American makers of plowshares could, with time and as required,
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.520]   make swords as well.
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.080]   But now, we can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense.
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.960]   We have been compelled to create a permanent armament's industry of vast proportions.
[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:19.560]   "This conjunction of an immense military establishment in a large arms industry is new in the American experience.
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.560]   Yet, we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications.
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.920]   In the councils of government, we must guard against an acquisition of unwarranted influence,
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.560]   whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:44.120]   the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist."
