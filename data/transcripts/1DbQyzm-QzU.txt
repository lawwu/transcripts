[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   All right, we got a question here from Steven.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   Steven says, "Hi Cal, I'm a software engineer and I struggle to stay focused
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.200]   anytime I have to wait for something to happen.
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.700]   For example, I may be waiting on a test suite to run or PR checks to pass or a
[00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:22.600]   service to start up.
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.300]   And these can take anywhere from two to 10 minutes.
[00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.300]   Is it okay to context switch these scenarios?
[00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.300]   And if not, what should I do with my attention given my next action will be
[00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.900]   dependent on the outcome of whatever I'm waiting for?"
[00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.500]   Steven, I hear this a lot from developers.
[00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.300]   They have all these pauses.
[00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.100]   Yeah, when you're waiting for a compile or for your for your checks to complete.
[00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.900]   From a context switching perspective,
[00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.900]   there's two extremes that you should stick towards here.
[00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.800]   Very, very related activities are very, very unrelated activities.
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:54.900]   Don't go in the middle.
[00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.100]   So by very related activities, I'm working on this code.
[00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.100]   I'm running these checks on that.
[00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.700]   It's going to take four minutes.
[00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.500]   All right, during that four minutes,
[00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.100]   I'm looking at similar code.
[00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.600]   The next thing I'm going to test or I'm going back and trying to clean up some
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.400]   code I just wrote.
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.600]   So you stay, you're staying entirely within the context of the thing you're
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.300]   working on.
[00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.900]   That will minimize the context switching overhead because you're keeping most of
[00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.000]   the context the same.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.500]   The other option is to go way far away from work altogether.
[00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.200]   So you say I need to go check Jesse Rogers Twitter account to see how the
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.600]   player union management MLB union discussions are going today.
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.300]   And are we getting closer to an agreement on the collective bargaining?
[00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.700]   Actually, their issue is with the competitive balance tax.
[00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.700]   Let's see what's going on there.
[00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.500]   That's so different from your work.
[00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.300]   But yes, it's a context shift, but it's not going to have nearly the same
[00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.000]   capture effect as something that's work related, but different than what you're
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.300]   doing.
[00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.600]   So what is this work related but different what you're doing?
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.500]   What's the middle of the spectrum that's going to kill you?
[00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.900]   That's going to be things like email.
[00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:06.500]   Let me go look at other work related stuff, expose myself to questions.
[00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.800]   I need to answer responsibilities being put on my plate stuff that people need
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.600]   for me, but I can't respond to all of them right now and then turn my attention
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.600]   back to what I'm doing.
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.900]   That gray zone is what's killer.
[00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.500]   That gray zone.
[00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.500]   If you look at an email inbox, I'm seeing work stuff, but not super related to
[00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.900]   exactly what I'm doing is what's going to give you 20 minutes of sluggishness
[00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.400]   until you get your mind locked back in.
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.000]   That's the gray zone that if you keep going to it again and again throughout
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   the morning by 2 p.m.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   You're done because that's a that's a painful context shift.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.100]   So either stick with what very close to what you're doing or go very far away
[00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.900]   from what you're doing.
[00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.500]   But don't go in somewhere in between so unrelated work stuff email is killer.
[00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.300]   Social media is killer.
[00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.600]   If it's emotionally arousing, that's also a problem.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.900]   So I'll put that as a caveat.
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:57.700]   Don't look at information about the war the Ukraine during your five-minute
[00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:58.200]   check.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.800]   That's also going to be quite diverting.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.300]   So nothing emotionally arousing nothing is related but not exactly related to
[00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.400]   what you're doing and it's the best you can do.
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.700]   Thank you.
