[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   [Music]
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.720]   How do we respond when life seems
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.780]   meaningless?
[00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:15.440]   When the suffering hits and the waves of suffering we feel seems itself to be totally pointless.
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.240]   What then?
[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.560]   This essential topic Pastor John took up in one of his most important sermons he has ever preached.
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.460]   It's one that he preached in the year 2013 and a listener named Jared sent it in to us as a clip that he loves
[00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:35.280]   And it's a clip many of you will recognize because it became a clip that got embedded into a Shane and Shane song
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.600]   Though you slay me
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:45.280]   Most of you have heard that song because the music video has now surpassed 7 million plays on YouTube. It's an incredible song
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.540]   Powerful music video. I know that God has used in many of your lives
[00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:56.080]   Even those of you who have watched it through a veil of tears and all of it is rooted in one sermon
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.560]   Everyone should listen to at some point. For now, here's an extended clip from Pastor John's
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.440]   2013 sermon. Have a listen.
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.360]   So
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.880]   Paul
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.200]   really does experience not losing heart
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.360]   because of
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.880]   truths, realities that he puts into his head
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.520]   day by day
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.560]   day by day
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.480]   for renewal
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.560]   Now one more step. What about the four at the beginning of verse 17?
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.940]   Like we're gonna beat verse 16 to death if we don't move on
[00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:42.480]   But my there's a lot of life in there. He doesn't give up easy. I love to pound on verses till they're dead
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.520]   That's an odd way to say it isn't it?
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.360]   Okay
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.880]   verse 17
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.600]   Verse 16 we don't lose heart. We're gonna be renewed every day
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.120]   for
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.240]   Because
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.760]   This light momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.560]   Beyond all comparison as we look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:16.540]   For the things that are seen are transient, but the things that are unseen are eternal. Verse 17 is the main
[00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:25.480]   Argument. It's the main because. The main thing. This light momentary affliction is doing something
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.320]   It's working for us an eternal weight of glory and verse all verse 18 does you say look at it
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.680]   You can't see it, but look at it
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.920]   if you look at the
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.580]   Fallenness of man coming at you with his guns or the the fall is nature coming at you with its tsunamis
[00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.580]   All you're gonna do is lose heart
[00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.240]   Stop looking at that
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.200]   Look at the unseen. We gotta say what what I'm seeing you talking about and how do you look at something that's unseen?
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.920]   That's a contradiction. Can't look at what you can't look at
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.920]   You said it's unseen, stop telling me to see it
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:03.840]   How do you look at
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.400]   the
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.760]   unseen so as to not lose heart and
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:16.240]   So as to be renewed every day and verse 17 is the main unseen thing you look at
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.120]   We do not lose heart
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:26.960]   Because this light momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory look at this he says look at this
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.320]   What do you what do you see when you look at verse?
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.920]   17 you see him calling
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.360]   His affliction which lasted a lifetime
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.760]   Momentary
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.000]   I'm 67 people supposed you supposed to retire, right?
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.360]   Paul suffered until the sword severed his head from his body
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.120]   There was no
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:00.440]   Year or two of fishing if Paul was going to have a retirement it would be post beheading
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:08.360]   So if he didn't have this he had nothing
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.920]   He said if there's no resurrection from the dead. I'm an idiot
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.000]   That's what he said first Corinthians 15
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.280]   He called his lifelong
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.760]   beatings and
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:28.640]   Shipwreck and sleepless nights and agony for the church. He called it
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:37.840]   Momentary you see that there in verse 17 this light momentary. He called it light and he called it momentary
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.040]   That's crazy. That's not what you see
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:48.760]   You look at it 60 years 50. I'm not sure how old he was when he died long time 20 30 years of
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.360]   relentless imprisonments and and
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.960]   Persecution and he calls it momentary and he calls it light and and you see also
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:04.120]   Don't you the contrast between momentary in verse 17 is eternal and the contrast with light is weight
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.860]   So let's read again notice those parallels
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:14.360]   His light momentary affliction is preparing for him and eternal that corresponds to momentary
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.080]   weight that corresponds to light of
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.440]   glory
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.240]   So he could see
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.920]   See see really you can't see but he saw beyond the grave
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:34.920]   According to promise he saw glory the glory of God that would be seen and the glory of God that would be given to him
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.640]   and
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.360]   It made his lifelong suffering look
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:45.440]   Momentary and it made the weight of the pain look light
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:51.160]   Come to me all you who labor and are heavy laden and I will
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:57.480]   Give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn from me for my yoke is
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:05.920]   Easy and my burden is light you are kidding me. You got to die for Jesus. You could call that light. Yes
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.440]   Why because I look to the unseen what glory
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:16.000]   Glory beyond the grave that's gonna so make up for this brief life
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:23.400]   It will look momentary and it will look light. That's the unseen you got to look at one more thing
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.560]   and this I end with this because it's just so
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:33.320]   So relevant for so many suffering people and so precious to me
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.120]   this word in verse 17
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.440]   preparing
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.240]   Preparing not only is all your affliction
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:49.640]   Momentary not only is all your affliction light in comparison to eternity and the glory there
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:53.880]   But all of it is totally meaningful
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:07:01.280]   That is a very controversial statement because of how much insane suffering there is in the world
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:09.120]   Every time something horrific happens an interviewer will say meaningless and that is what it looks like
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.760]   That's what it looks like
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:17.160]   See look at it. Look at it. This is meaningless these these 23 kids in India
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.360]   What did they do? They ate lunch and
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.080]   They're dead
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:27.040]   Or more, Oklahoma or Boston
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:33.320]   It's everywhere we now we've got the internet we got no excuse for not crying every day
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:36.400]   We put those who weep, right?
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:44.040]   If you don't have a theology that can cope with the internet horrors, you just better check out or get one
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:47.600]   This text says
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.840]   our
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.400]   light
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.400]   momentary affliction is
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:08:01.400]   Preparing for us an eternal weight. It doesn't say will be followed by an
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.640]   Eternal weight of glory that would be good enough
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:08.760]   That would be good enough that's not what it says
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:15.440]   Cut air gods. Oh my forgive the Greek. I just love it. I've got to like dump it out every now and then
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:20.640]   You don't need to know that the word means produced prepare cause to bring about
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:23.480]   I'll venture this
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.160]   every
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:26.800]   millisecond of
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.120]   your
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:32.320]   pain from the fallen nature or fallen man every
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:36.520]   millisecond of your misery in the path of obedience is
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:42.600]   Producing a peculiar glory you will get because of that
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:51.680]   That's a very controversial statement and I believe it so that if anybody says to me that a believers
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.560]   Suffering was meaningless. I'll
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:09:00.760]   be quiet probably because they're they're probably hurting really bad right now and I'm gonna wait and
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:05.480]   See when the right time is but I'm gonna come back eventually and say it wasn't
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.800]   meaningless I
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:10.640]   Don't care if it was cancer or criticism. I
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:13.480]   Don't care if it was
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:16.800]   slander or sickness it wasn't
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.640]   meaningless because verse 17 says
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:21.520]   my
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:22.840]   light
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.840]   momentary lifelong
[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:27.480]   Total affliction is doing something
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:33.300]   It's doing something it's not meaningless, of course, you can't see what it's doing
[00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:40.200]   This is the main unseen thing verse 18 is talking about I think what's the unseen you're supposed to look at
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:46.840]   You're supposed to look at the the the promise of God in verse 17 that says
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:51.240]   Your pain is doing something for you
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:54.480]   You can't see it. You can't feel it either
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:10:00.880]   You see it with the eyes of faith believe it because the text says it or you lose heart
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:07.720]   And I'm gonna close with John the Baptist as an illustration. I love I love and groan. My name is John
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:10.400]   I loved all the Johns in the world
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:13.440]   That's a weird thing to say in the city
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:20.360]   If I were good enough I would
[00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:25.940]   Um, but I love John the Baptist he's in prison and you know why he's in prison
[00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:32.920]   Jesus said there is no man born of woman greater than John the Baptist
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:39.120]   He's in prison. You know why he's in prison because he looked the king right in the face and said you can't have her
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:43.200]   She is Phillips wife. You're an adulterer
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:49.280]   Well, that's a very dangerous thing to say to a king who has absolute authority over anybody do anything he wants
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:52.080]   So he puts him in jail. He's scared of him. So he hasn't killed him
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:55.120]   But there he sits and now it's Herod's birthday
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:58.200]   And he gives a party for himself
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:04.000]   Throws in a little bonus little sexual bonus for his guests has a stepdaughter
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.320]   dance
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:08.320]   Really really pleasing dance
[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:11.200]   turns everybody on
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:17.280]   They're all loving it. And when she's done, he knows she's pleased to guess so
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:21.560]   To reward her. He says I'll give you whatever you want up to half my kingdom
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:24.280]   She goes to her mom
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:28.080]   Herodias who hates John the Baptist. He says what should I ask for?
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:33.160]   And her mom says ask for the head of John the Baptist on a platter
[00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:41.920]   She walks back in everybody's listening. What's she gonna ask for? I want right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:50.480]   Silence in the room King can't take it back. Okay, he whispers to his attendant
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.720]   Get it
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.720]   John sitting there in the cell
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:12:01.040]   Wondering how the kingdom is gonna come and the door opens and two guys are standing there one with a sword
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:06.760]   It's just moment of silence doesn't know what's going on. And the one with the sword says
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:11.000]   Come over here and kneel down and if you struggle we'll bind you
[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:16.720]   And just what what what happened what?
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:20.000]   What's going on?
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   and the executioner says
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.560]   King's daughter danced
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.560]   in the party and
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:31.360]   She asked for your head and we've come to get it. We're gonna take your head
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:36.920]   That's the last thing he has to think about in the next 20 seconds
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:39.720]   What would you think?
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.080]   Everything in me says God
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:46.820]   What can be more meaningless than a party?
[00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:52.880]   Where a girl dances asked for the greatest man on the planet's?
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:58.360]   Head and within two verses of the Bible. He's dead
[00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:01.360]   God
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.360]   God
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:06.480]   Meaningless
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.740]   absolutely meaningless way to die
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:13.320]   Nothing glorious about it. It stinks to high heaven
[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:16.160]   I'll tell you I
[00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:21.680]   Hope God in his mercy put into John's head in those 20 seconds
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:24.040]   this
[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:28.880]   Like momentary affliction is working for you an eternal weight of glory
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:37.200]   And so I I believe the main
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:40.560]   Because
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:47.600]   For not losing heart in this text is that none of your suffering is meaningless
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:52.680]   It'll feel that way. That's why verse 18 says don't look at what's seen
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:58.520]   I mean you just stand there watching that happen. You just stand there watching that happen. You're gonna kill him
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:04.960]   Do anything she just dance don't do that. It's meaningless. This is totally crazy. This is a
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:07.560]   Absurd novel this doesn't happen
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:12.640]   That's what that's the way you talk right? What you what your eyes are telling you is
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:14.600]   meaningless
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:22.440]   Don't look to what you see when your mom dies when your kid dies when you got cancer at 40 when a car
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:26.680]   Careens into the sidewalk and takes her out
[00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:29.880]   Don't say this meaningless. It's not
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:35.800]   It's working for you an eternal weight of glory
[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.160]   therefore therefore
[00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:41.040]   Do not lose heart
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:47.920]   But take these truths all the ones you've heard in every message and day by day
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:50.880]   focus on
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:58.720]   Preach them to yourself every morning get alone with God and preach his word into your mind
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:02.080]   until your heart sings with
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:09.720]   Confidence that you are new and cared for so God come and do your mighty
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:16.960]   Work through your word and through this people in all their ministries. I pray in Jesus name
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:27.480]   Powerful truth as an amazing sermon clip go and listen to the whole sermon at some point is titled the glory of God in the sight
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:30.360]   of eternity preached on July 26 2013
[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:35.760]   sermon on 2nd Corinthians 4 verses 16 to 18 the audio and video is at
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:42.080]   Desiring God org and be sure to go to youtube and watch though you slay me by Shannon Shane with the Piper sermon clip
[00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:44.080]   - if you have not it is powerful
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:47.800]   So Jared, thank you for reviving this clip and sending it to us
[00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.880]   It'll be hard to top this one
[00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:53.800]   But if you have a favorite sermon clip of Pastor John preaching send it to me
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:57.880]   Give me the title of the sermon and the timestamps of the audio of when the clip begins and ends
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:03.640]   Tell me why it's impacted you give me your name and the closest city to you and email me all those details at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org
[00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:10.160]   Put the word clip in the subject line, please if you would and maybe we can share it here on the podcast
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:14.080]   Next up is faultless chastity
[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:18.600]   faultless chastity too high of a standard for
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.200]   pastors
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:25.600]   To boot a pastor from their role for sexual sin. Isn't that too harsh?
[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:33.000]   Question on the minds of a few listeners at least and it's up next time. I'm your host Tony Reinke. We will see you on Friday
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
