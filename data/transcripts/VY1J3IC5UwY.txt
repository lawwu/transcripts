[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.040]   I want to talk about an article from the New York Times from April 18th, the day before I'm recording
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.360]   this show. It's an article from the New York Times Magazine written by an editor over there
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:19.600]   named Willie Staley, and it's titled "What was Twitter Anyway?" I don't typically love
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:26.400]   Twitter reporting as a self-critical reporting on Twitter. I don't usually love that format.
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:33.520]   I don't always care what sort of in-the-weed Twitter users have to say about Twitter because
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:42.960]   I don't know. It's like talking to the alcoholic about the difference between different brown
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.280]   liquors and the buzz they create or something. It's like someone whose life is so involved in it,
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.240]   it can be kind of weird. This article was great. It was a Twitter article. I was waiting for a
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:58.960]   journalist to write because I think it is incisive at getting at, here is how Twitter unfolded.
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.000]   Here is why me, reporter William Staley, and everyone I know is using this so much, and here's
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.480]   what's happening now, why that party is coming to an end. I want to go through this and then react
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.640]   to it a little bit. Now, if Jesse was here, we would load this up on the screen. He's not here.
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.200]   I don't know how to use technology, so I have it printed out. I'm actually just going to be
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:26.160]   reading things. You can, however, watch me reading this article at youtube.com/CalNewportMedia. This
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.840]   is episode 245. You can also find this episode at thedeeplife.com. If you just click on watch and
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.400]   go to episode 245, you'll find the video there as well. I have a couple of quotes I want to read.
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:42.960]   Let's start with who William Staley is. As he says early in the article, "I am an editor at
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.040]   the New York Times Magazine, but I think it should be stated clearly up front that I have something
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:55.760]   of an acute problem with Twitter." He puts that up there right up front. He gives an interesting
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:03.120]   anecdote about getting involved in a pylon. It was a little bit hard for me to follow,
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:10.240]   but I think what happened here is that La Crusade that makes the enameled cast iron cookware famous
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.360]   for wedding registries everywhere, sort of expensive French cookware, had advertised
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:23.120]   something about Star Wars themed La Crusade cookware. He thought that was incongruous.
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.240]   He thinks about that as something that people who are really refined people into cooking care about,
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.840]   and Star Wars he thinks about maybe comic book geeks. He wrote a tweet that said,
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.960]   "The Star Wars La Crusade pots imply the existence of a type of guy I find genuinely unimaginable."
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:47.360]   He sent it, went back to work. Then around lunchtime, he says, things started happening.
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.960]   He talks about this huge pylon of people quote tweeting again and again,
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:57.520]   all of them pointing out problems with this tweet that he sent, such as, "I enjoyed that this tweet
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:03.920]   manages to be sexist on multiple levels. Newsflash, women cook and like Star Wars. Imagine a woman.
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.440]   Hi, have you met women? Women like Star Wars, men cook. My husband is a huge Star Wars fan and is
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.920]   the cook in the house. He bakes too. Sorry to blow your mind." And onward and onward and onward
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:22.560]   for a couple of days. He pointed out this is not a major thing, right? Here's how he describes it.
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.720]   It was low effort clowning that felt charged only because it was traveling along such high
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.240]   energy vectors, sexism, homophobia, Star Wars fandom. The platform can coax this exact sort
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.320]   of response out of its users with an incredibly small amount of effort. It's only on the receiving
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:45.120]   end where all these messages collect in one place that it feels oppressive. That's actually really
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:51.920]   good writing by the way. It was charged only because it was traveling along such high energy
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.080]   vectors, small amount of effort, but on the receiving end, they collect, it feels oppressive.
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:02.160]   I like that. Very clear writing. He says you could in this situation quit or turn off Twitter,
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.200]   but he says in theory, you can just log on, wait for it to end, but no one does that.
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:11.360]   All right. So I think right up front, we get an interesting and I think incredibly apt description
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:17.120]   of what is this pile on dynamic that dominates Twitter at the moment. It's this notion of things
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.880]   get put out there and then they can very quickly, people can take turns and test things out and see
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.440]   if they can gather attention with who can clown or dunk on the person even better. And they have a
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:33.040]   certain energy to them because they often, in order to gain attention for my dunk to perhaps
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:38.080]   gain the applause of others, if you can connect it to what he calls a high charge vector, that
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.240]   is successful. But for me sending that out, I'm just saying like, let me try something here.
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.400]   This guy talking about Star Wars, let me try something here, connect to this or that, maybe
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.480]   it'll get some applause. Very little effort, but for the person on the receiving end, it all adds
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:55.440]   up and disproportionately, it feels like your whole world is coming, collapsing in on you.
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.720]   So I thought that was a really apt decision of what it's like to be on Twitter right now.
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:04.640]   So he's like, that's what Twitter, this is sort of what Twitter has been like recently.
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:09.360]   And then he says, then we get the Musk's takeover of the platform.
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:17.040]   And he says, this has strained the sense of conviviality that made Twitter feel like a
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.160]   party in the first place. The site feels a little emptier, though certainly not dead.
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.400]   Most like the part, more like the part of the dinner party where only the serious drinkers
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.800]   remain. Whiskey is being poured into the wine glasses. He steps back and has sort of
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:34.640]   ends this section with reflection. What exactly have we been doing here for the last decade and
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.120]   a half? All right, so that's the setup to this piece. He's about now to go into the evolution
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.440]   of Twitter, how it got to this place. But I think this is a very accurate sense of the last year.
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:49.520]   Twitter had become this place where this is one of the primary interactions happening as a sort of
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:56.000]   often mild, sometimes intense pile on type of dynamic of quote tweeting and trying to dunk on
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.080]   each other, typically trying to dunk on your ideological enemies or dunking on someone in
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:07.920]   such a way that signals your, the approval might solicit the approval of your, your crowd or signal
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:13.840]   that you're a dunking on a representative of the enemy crowd. And as, as Musk took over and
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:18.400]   journalists who don't like Musk have been leaving Twitter, then it's been having this sort of empty
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:24.480]   sense of like, it's still going on, but some of the, the marquee names that really put an energy
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:28.640]   into what's going on because these big name reporters and personalities are on here as they
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:33.200]   sort of leave. It's not many people, but it creates an outsized effect. And I think all that is true.
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.960]   I think that's a really good description of what Twitter feels like. I think it really is true
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:42.560]   right now that even just a small amount of sort of these mainstream news organizations and reporters
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.480]   and personalities moving away from Twitter does give it that into the dinner party feel you're
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:50.880]   still there. You're still pouring your drink, but the table's not as full and it changes the mood a
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:55.280]   little bit. All right. Staley then goes on to give a history, which I'm going to very briefly just
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:04.560]   hit on some highlights. So he talks about how it got started. Jack Dorsey wanted to call it status
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:12.000]   or statuses. And Dorsey was really keen on this idea that the point of Twitter is to report what
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:19.120]   your status is. I am doing this. I feel like this, right? That was the original idea of Twitter.
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:23.040]   He got into an ideological battle with Evan Williams when he got involved with the company
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:26.640]   as well, where Williams thought this should be, people should be tweeting about stuff that's
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:33.280]   happening. And Dorsey said, no, it should be tweeting about me, what's happening to me.
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:37.760]   And so the famous example was if there's a fire over at some address is the tweet,
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:44.800]   I am seeing a fire at this address or is the tweet, there is a fire at this address.
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:50.560]   According to Staley, Williams was a big fan of the opposite of the ladder. And Dorsey was a big
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:56.000]   fan of the former Williams won that out. And the prompt changed from how are you feeling or whatever
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.440]   to what's happening. And a big turning point there was actually the miracle on the Hudson.
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:06.240]   There's someone, the tweets around that news event, Sully Sullenberger landing that Airbus
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:15.040]   A380 on or A330 probably landing that on the Hudson and how the tweets were more informative
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:18.720]   than the formal news was sort of this turning point of wait a second, this can be a place to
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:23.280]   actually discuss what's happening, not just what's happening to you. So that was a big change.
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:29.520]   The next big bullet point comes in 2009. Here's a key quote. Twitter's takeover of the media class
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:36.640]   was rapid. In April 2009, Maureen Downe interviewed Williams and Stone, telling them that she would
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:41.920]   rather be tied up to stakes in the Kalahari Desert, have honey poured over me and red ants eat out my
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:47.520]   eyes than open a Twitter account; she signed up three months later to promote her column.
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:55.200]   Another good sentence. And then it became, I'm quoting Staley here, absolutely irresistible to
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:01.840]   journalists. Okay. So, this is another big turning point. People were starting to use Twitter to talk
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:05.920]   about things that were happening and ideas that were interesting, not just what they felt like
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:11.280]   or what was happening to them. It was no longer the Facebook status. It was a micro blogging type
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:16.560]   platform. This became very appealing to journalists. And now you get all the journalists
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.680]   on there because information and articles are being passed along and they want to know
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:26.240]   what is happening. There was around this time, and I'm quoting here, an enormous expansion in
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:30.480]   web media with Buzzfeed, Vice, and others pouring truckloads of venture capital into the field. And
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:34.880]   though Twitter never drove much traffic, it was nevertheless important for journalists to be
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:39.760]   there because everyone else was there. This was where your articles would be read and digested
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:44.800]   by your peers and betters. It was doubly important because of how precarious these new jobs were.
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:49.360]   Your Twitter profile was your calling card, potentially a life raft to a new job. The
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:55.440]   platform was an extremely fraught sort of LinkedIn, one you would use publicly to waste company time.
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:10:00.560]   So that's the next phase of Twitter is we have all the journalists get on there.
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:04.640]   They want to know what's going on. They want to promote their own articles. They want to be a
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:09.920]   part of the conversation. They wanted to build up some sort of new media credibility that they
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:17.040]   could use if their venture backed web based mobile news startup failed, that they could
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:23.520]   point towards, I've got these followers and make it easier for them to land at a new publication.
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:28.800]   Once all the journalists were on there, this again changed the character of Twitter. So here's
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:36.400]   Staley. But this journalistic swarming instinct made Twitter an ideal place for activists to get
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:42.160]   a message out. So once we figured out, wait, the journalists are on here and they're getting story
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:47.600]   ideas from here and they're quoting tweets in their articles and they're using, since they're
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:51.760]   on here trying to promote their things and what other people are writing, trying to see what news
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:57.040]   is going on, they might want to write about. It is as if there was a single bar in Manhattan
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:02.720]   where all of the top editors of the main newspapers 50 years ago were all gathering to drink every
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:07.040]   night. If that happened, then if you wanted to spread some news, you would go hang out at that
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:13.280]   bar. Twitter became that bar. And this is where we began to get more of this activist energy.
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:18.640]   And I'm using activists in the general sense here, anyone who had some sort of message to spread.
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:22.240]   And a lot of this was beneficial. A lot of this was actually grassroots message spreading,
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:27.280]   but also anyone who had an ax to grind or an ideology that they were obsessed about.
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:34.480]   So then it became a place to try to influence the public sphere. It was still useful for people to
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:38.640]   be on here. Here's a quote. "If you're good at this game, it could be good for you both on Twitter
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:45.520]   and off. People got commissions and book deals. Not many, but enough. Some people lost their jobs.
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:50.640]   Not many, but enough. A couple of people got TV shows out of it. Once someone told a story so
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:55.360]   wild, it was turned to a feature film. Hell, one guy even went and got himself elected president."
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:12:02.720]   But after a while, this focus, and obviously Trump probably pushed this the last bit of the way
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:10.480]   towards this new configuration, but this focus is what in the last four or five years
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:16.080]   turned Twitter into the Coliseum, the way I've been describing it in most of my recent talks
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:22.560]   about this. Now that all the journalists were on there, now this is where the agenda was being set.
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:30.560]   Now this is where ideas were being tested and the feedback could sway how companies operated and how
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:36.560]   things were reported. This importance that was concentrated into this one homogenized social
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:44.720]   internet tool inevitably turned it into a Coliseum. And it became a battleground. You're either one of
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:53.360]   the 1% of users responsible for 75% of the tweets waging war on here, the ultimate ideological,
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:13:00.080]   and I mean that not just politically, gladiatorial battlefield. And you had to take down and dunk on
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:08.800]   your enemies. And you also had to be very careful about curtailing your near allies to make sure that
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:14.320]   the proverbial or conceptual Overton window did not shift even a little bit. So if someone shifted
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:19.520]   a little bit on the Overton window, you had to get everyone on that person fast because a little
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:24.240]   shift is how Overton windows make big moves over time. It wasn't the guy saying the crazy thing.
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:27.600]   It was the professor who's more or less aligned with you that's like, "Hey, maybe you have some
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:31.920]   questions about this." No, no, no, no. We got to get on that because this is where sense is being
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:36.720]   made. And William Staley, editor from the New York Times Magazine is on here and he's going to see
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:40.080]   that and it's going to affect what they say or don't say in the magazine. And all this was happening
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:44.160]   from all sides on all sorts of issues, political, non-political, sports, entertainment, whatever it
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:49.040]   was. Then it became the Coliseum. And for the last three to four years, the primary, I think,
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:53.120]   addictive quality of Twitter for the average user, which is not one of these reporters, not one of
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:14:00.000]   these partisans, but a non-posting observer, is that it's fun to watch important people hit each
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:10.080]   other with sticks and to say, "Ooh, this guy ducked under it, spun around and escaped. This guy got
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:15.600]   nailed in the head and then everyone else swarmed on him. He never got up. This guy was like the
[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:22.480]   final battle against Magwa at the end of Last of the Mohicans where he swung his hatchet in the
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:31.680]   older, wiser man with his sword, somersaulted under the hatchet, spun backhand sword to the back,
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:35.680]   right through the spine." You got to watch the final scenes of Last of the Mohicans.
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:41.120]   If you don't know what I'm talking about, Michael Mann, all right, we're talking DDL,
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:45.360]   Daniel Day-Lewis, must watch. You can find it online. And then that's what it became. And that
[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:51.600]   was inevitable. And then Musk took over. And when Musk took over, the journalist, especially for the
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:58.400]   mainstream left-leaning journalist said, "This party, we're at this nice dinner party." And it
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:02.720]   was getting kind of raucous. And then the host said, "By the way, I sold my apartment to someone
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:06.800]   you don't like and now it's his dinner party." And so they're like, "We're going to kind of leave."
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:13.840]   And that's where we are now. And we find this question, what was Twitter anyway, being the
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:19.760]   headline? And my response to all of this, beyond just saying this is a well-written, very perceptive
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:25.680]   article, and I really enjoyed it. The link is in the show notes and I recommend it. My response to
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:34.080]   all of this is, and I say this with all modesty, I told you so. I've been saying this for years.
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:41.760]   As one of the few people who is orbiting this world, but has never been an active Twitter user,
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:47.680]   I'm telling you from the outside, this metaphorical dinner party got weird a long time ago.
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:55.440]   This metaphorical dinner party became less an Algonquin round table and more shades of eyes
[00:15:55.440 --> 00:16:01.360]   wide shut. It's weird. The rich guys are putting on masks. I don't know what's happening here,
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:06.240]   but it's weird that you're defending this so strong. I mean, it's not the worst thing in the
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:11.280]   world, but why is everyone using this? Why were so many editors and journalists and academics
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:15.680]   saying, "Of course I have to be on here." I was like, "No, you don't. This is weird."
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:23.440]   It's entertaining, but this is weird. This should be much more niche than it is. I used to say,
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:28.960]   and I stand by it, Twitter should have been like Game of Thrones, something that a non-trivial
[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:33.680]   group of people were very into, but most people could care less. It somehow fought above its
[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:39.520]   weight class. Again, this is yet another example from news reporting I've been talking about in
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:46.400]   recent weeks where I'm glad to see this sort of retrospective distancing from this platform.
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:50.400]   I don't think it's evil and I don't think you're bad if you use it. I just do not think it should
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:55.360]   be ubiquitous. I do not think it should be necessary, a precondition to be part of the
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:17:01.760]   conversation. I was so happy to see the Washington Post move their nationals coverage off of live
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:06.080]   tweets and into really nicely designed websites. I was happy a couple of weeks ago when I talked
[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:11.760]   about, for whatever reason they did it, NPR saying, "We're not tweeting news. Come back to NPR." I
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:17.600]   think this is all healthier. I think we're going to see more and more retrospectives like William
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:24.640]   or Willie Staley's where people look back and say, "Not my proudest moment, what I was doing on
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:33.600]   there." Not as essential as I was telling everyone that it was. I think the haze is lifting. I think
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:42.160]   the fog is dissipating and we're going to gain back hopefully a more diverse, grounded public
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:46.240]   discourse. So let's knock on wood. But that was a great article. It was a good history. I think
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:49.680]   seeing Twitter's evolution in those phases, that was interesting. It's not something I'd seen before
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:56.720]   laid out so clearly. So check that out and hopefully join me in my cautious optimism that
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:03.040]   Twitter's not going away, but it's no longer being mistaken for the town square. We now see
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:06.400]   that it's devolved into a coliseum. I want to see the demolition derby sometimes,
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:15.120]   but I don't want the demolition derby to be at the core of how the discourse...
