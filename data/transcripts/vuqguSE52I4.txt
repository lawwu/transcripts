[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:10.320]   When you hear someone say that they're a marketing generalist
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.400]   what's your first impression?
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.720]   Is it a good thing?
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.360]   Is it bad?
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.640]   Do you assume they make more or less money
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.040]   than a specialist?
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.280]   Let me ask you another question.
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.200]   Which one sounds like it would give you more job stability?
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.480]   I recently did a poll on LinkedIn.
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.440]   45% of respondents said that being a marketing generalist
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.420]   is great for early career individuals.
[00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.640]   Now 30% said that it's better for late careers
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.960]   and the remaining 25% said that it's better
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.980]   to have broad skill sets than being a pure specialist.
[00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.260]   So which is it?
[00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.860]   The truth is both a specialist and generalist
[00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.380]   can provide great stability and both have the potential
[00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.240]   to result in very positive personal economic gain.
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.880]   So let's break this down.
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.400]   What does it mean to be a marketing generalist?
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.280]   If you've allowed yourself to experience
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.960]   different job functions, being a generalist means
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.220]   you know just enough about all the various functions
[00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.760]   around you and you package that together
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.860]   and bring all that wisdom and influence into your work.
[00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.160]   You're that proverbial jack of all trades
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.140]   that could be the fabric that holds everything together.
[00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.560]   At this stage of my career, I would describe myself
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.440]   as a marketing generalist with a specialty in web marketing.
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.600]   Being a generalist has allowed me to be proactive
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.560]   and productive in meetings and take on
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.920]   that connective tissue role where I understand
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.040]   enough of the context of the meeting
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.280]   just to ask the right questions at the right time
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.900]   and really be that translator between various specialists
[00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.620]   and sometimes even leading cross-functional tiger teams
[00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.280]   that have nothing to do with my direct line of work.
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.000]   So today, we'll be joined by Ashley Foss.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.120]   She's the head of Lifecycle Marketing Portfolio
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.600]   at Atlassian.
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.440]   Not only is she a hilarious and a passionate individual,
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.480]   but she shares some great examples about the power
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.800]   of being a marketing generalist.
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.440]   In this video, she'll cover topics such as
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.960]   how to be the bridge builder that aligns teams
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.920]   to a common outcome, how a generalist equips you
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.140]   with skills to propel your career,
[00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.240]   and tips on how to become an effective marketing generalist.
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.020]   All right, let's get started.
[00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.860]   - Hey, everyone.
[00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.560]   Today, we're talking about the power of a general marketer
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.080]   and joining us is Ashley Foss.
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.400]   Ashley, how are you doing?
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.220]   - Hey, I'm good.
[00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.400]   I'm excited to talk about this.
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.760]   I'm real passionate about this topic.
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.400]   - And I can't wait to dive in with you.
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.480]   Can you maybe just tell us a little bit about yourself
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.120]   before we get started?
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.940]   - Sure.
[00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.080]   So my name is Ashley and I am a marketer, writer,
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.480]   and speaker by day, and a singer, actor,
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.760]   and fitness fiend by night.
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.600]   - That is awesome.
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.720]   - We're gonna dive right into the whole generalist thing.
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.500]   Go straight. - Yeah, I don't know.
[00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.300]   You know, what I hear is like well-rounded, balanced life,
[00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.500]   work, and after.
[00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.220]   So I love everything you just said.
[00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.460]   And I think that's actually quite often,
[00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.340]   quite frankly, the theme of today.
[00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.820]   You know, I think the idea of a general marketer,
[00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.580]   which we're gonna kind of ask you what your take on it is,
[00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.020]   but like given today's market, you know,
[00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.940]   it's a very unstable time, right?
[00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.660]   And people are actually equipped with a lot of skills.
[00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.720]   And the question is how do you put all those skills to use?
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.920]   Or how do you find an entry point
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.420]   that allows you to branch off into many things?
[00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.240]   'Cause I think listeners to this particular podcast
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.200]   are just dying to know,
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.280]   especially if they're at a point
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.160]   where they wanna pivot their careers,
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.480]   or maybe they're at the starting point
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.560]   and they just graduated.
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.640]   It's like, where do I go from here?
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.800]   So kind of turn to Ashley, like to you,
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.340]   like what does a general marketer mean to you?
[00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.720]   - So I think of a generalist.
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.040]   There's a couple of different frameworks
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.160]   that I've used over the years
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.600]   to kind of frame up this thinking
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.440]   that are pretty popular in the market.
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.680]   One is the concept of the T-shaped marketer.
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.300]   So it's basically looking at some of the adjacent disciplines
[00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.660]   and skills and crafts within marketing
[00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.960]   and being broad across the top,
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.100]   and then eventually going deep in one area.
[00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.200]   But looking at that, again,
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.120]   from an adjacent crafts perspective,
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.660]   not just a single area.
[00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.140]   So that's one that I like.
[00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.520]   The other one that I've heard that I think is interesting,
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.120]   it talks about the I-shaped marketer.
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.080]   So it's similar to the T-shaped marketer,
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.980]   except that it has this bottom foundation
[00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.800]   of leadership skills or communication skills
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.940]   or team management skills or project management skills,
[00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.840]   like kind of basic things you need to do
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:33.680]   if you're gonna be a leader
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.960]   or you're gonna be a professional as that foundation,
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.620]   that no matter what craft you're in,
[00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.480]   there's some core skills that go across the bottom.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.560]   So those are two that I really like.
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.680]   I think the biggest thing for me is,
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.400]   I think there's value for specialists and for generalists.
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.640]   And I think that the market tends to swing.
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:50.920]   It's a pendulum.
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.800]   For a while, particularly when I first graduated,
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.240]   you know, years ago,
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.080]   we were in a very specialist market.
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.200]   And it was like, we need you to have 15 years in email.
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.400]   And I'm like, that is a lot of years
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.720]   in just like a single channel.
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.560]   Like, you don't need me to be good at writing
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.060]   or good at like analytics or any of that.
[00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.200]   You just like only email.
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.200]   And then it swung back.
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.300]   We saw this over the last couple of years,
[00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.280]   the meme that everybody wants to hire one person
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.560]   to do 10 jobs.
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.520]   And it's like, you have to be a marketer and a writer
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.640]   and a graphic artist and a web dev and in it, right?
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.880]   This concept that it's like,
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.280]   don't realize these job descriptions
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.360]   are 10 job descriptions.
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.440]   These are 10 jobs, not one job.
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.800]   So I think the pendulum swings.
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.240]   I think there are plenty of times
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.720]   where everybody wants a generalist,
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.200]   then it swings back and everyone wants a specialist.
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.320]   So I think both are valid paths.
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.620]   For me personally,
[00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.000]   that ability to look across the different areas
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.820]   within marketing, the different channels,
[00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.420]   the different audience types, the different deliverables,
[00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:53.580]   that's what's fun for me,
[00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.660]   that ability to connect the dots.
[00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.700]   So that's what I need when I talk about being a journalist
[00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:00.980]   and why I get excited about it.
[00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.140]   - Yeah, that's a really, really good point.
[00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.500]   Right now, and I personally experienced it as well, right?
[00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.300]   You have organizations
[00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.860]   that may be flattening the organization or whatnot.
[00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.020]   And naturally, as you point out,
[00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.720]   when headcount gets removed, for example,
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.800]   it's gotta get absorbed somewhere.
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.920]   And right now, given the economy,
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.360]   companies don't have necessarily the budget
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.740]   to replace headcount with headcount.
[00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.240]   So it does get absorbed by the team, right?
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.120]   And you're right, one headcount
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.920]   does a job of two, three, or four these days.
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.560]   And it's very, very true.
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.120]   I want to kind of maybe touch back
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.920]   on something you introduced us with,
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.720]   which is just kind of like how your career got started,
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:34.560]   right?
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.680]   'Cause you mentioned that whether it's a T or it's the I,
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.040]   what they share in common is this horizontal bar
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.780]   of just like a broad spectrum of experience.
[00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:44.740]   So can you take us through like your own experience
[00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:45.980]   and what that looks like?
[00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.220]   And I'm kind of curious to understand like,
[00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:51.940]   how did that start becoming maybe a launching point
[00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.780]   for exploration to different parts of marketing?
[00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:58.300]   - So I graduated in 2008,
[00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.340]   which was one of the worst recessions we've had
[00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:01.940]   in a very long time.
[00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.420]   It was not a good time to be a marketer
[00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:05.780]   coming out of school.
[00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:07.300]   So that was one factor against me.
[00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:11.680]   The other factor against me is that I graduated and moved.
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.000]   And so marketing, especially early in your career,
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.340]   because there's a lot of art and science to it,
[00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:21.560]   there's not an objective right answer in most cases,
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.400]   the way there is for some of the hard,
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.980]   you know, the STEM areas where there's, you know,
[00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:26.820]   can you do the math?
[00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:28.300]   Can you do the code?
[00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.200]   So it's a lot harder in an early career to get in somewhere
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.120]   if people don't know you,
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.240]   and you don't really have a portfolio to speak to,
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.160]   to say, this is how I know that I've got this experience
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.360]   or this is how I can prove it, or I've worked with you.
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.280]   So that was the second strike against me.
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.680]   And then the third strike against me
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:45.480]   is I moved from Texas to California.
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.840]   And at the time when everybody was co-located
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.800]   and everybody had to go into an office,
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.040]   most of the companies that could afford it
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.680]   would actually outsource,
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.300]   like basically put their sales and marketing
[00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:00.120]   in a cheaper state.
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:03.040]   Like they basically only had developers
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.880]   in their California offices because it's so expensive here.
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:07.260]   Real estate is very expensive.
[00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.200]   And so I had like three strikes against me coming out of it.
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.680]   It was like, you're new,
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.680]   you move to a new place where nobody knows you,
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:16.520]   and you move to a place that's like kind of not a hub
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:19.720]   for marketing and sales and communications.
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.080]   And at the time I had my marketing degree,
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:24.360]   but I didn't really know where I wanted to go in marketing.
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.640]   And so I basically just took the first job I could get.
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.680]   I was interviewing a ton.
[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.800]   A lot of people said, oh, you seem very smart.
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:31.880]   You seem very eager.
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:33.600]   You seem like a hard worker,
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.920]   but we need somebody with 10 years of experience.
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:38.120]   And again, similar to the market right now
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:40.480]   where there's this glut of talent,
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.320]   they could hire somebody more senior.
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.400]   They didn't have to kind of settle
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:48.400]   for this random Texas girl who barely has,
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:49.960]   you know, barely has a marketing degree.
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.640]   It's like, you just got out of school.
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.880]   So I took a startup role
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.180]   and I was doing a variety of things.
[00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:57.480]   I was doing writing.
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.600]   I was doing sales enablement.
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.440]   I mean, it was a startup.
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.840]   We had like five people.
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.240]   I was doing some math things.
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.720]   I worked in solar.
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:07.920]   And so it really just taught me, you know,
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:10.960]   I had these grand visions of being in this big company
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.600]   and I'm going to become the CMO of Coca-Cola.
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:17.000]   And I'm, you know, that is not at all what happened.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.320]   So what I would say a common thread,
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.240]   I've worked in solar, I've worked in aviation,
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:23.940]   I've worked in presentation and design and training firm.
[00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:27.280]   I worked in two security companies prior to Atlassian.
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:29.480]   And then I've been in several teams at Atlassian
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:32.160]   across different audiences and markets.
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.280]   And the common thread is that I can fall in love
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:36.520]   with the audience.
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:38.520]   I can fall in love with their problems.
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:43.700]   I am, the thing that I am passionate about is marketing.
[00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:46.880]   And that translates to being passionate
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.240]   about the audience and their problems.
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.160]   So it's not about the specific industry
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.000]   or the specific tasks.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.240]   It's really about how do I fall in love with
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.380]   and serve that audience?
[00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:58.840]   And then how does that connect back to the business
[00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:00.520]   to serve the business goals?
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:02.440]   I'm acting as that bridge.
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:06.040]   And so I think that that overarching mindset
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.080]   is the thing that has allowed me to lean
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:11.100]   into different types of audiences, types of companies,
[00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:13.960]   types of channels, types of metrics.
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:18.080]   I'm not super precious about which marketing thing I do.
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:21.080]   I'm super precious about the audience.
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:21.920]   - I love that.
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:24.040]   And as a matter of fact, I chuckle to myself
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.360]   to date myself as well,
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:28.280]   'cause I graduated from undergrad in 2001,
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:30.520]   which was the great dot-com bubble burst, right?
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:34.560]   So like no one was hiring for marketing.
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:36.240]   And I think you caught out two things
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.320]   that are really, really important
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.000]   because someone might wonder,
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.360]   it's like, well, why should I consider a generalist role?
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:45.280]   Like almost journalists almost seems like watered down,
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:46.400]   seems like a specialist,
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:47.920]   like are they smarter and more experienced?
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:51.600]   Like, no, like the reason why I believe a generalist
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:55.120]   is so important is for a few things you mentioned.
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.080]   If you have the curiosity to understand
[00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.600]   what engages an audience,
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.600]   and you have the innate curiosity to figure out like,
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:06.000]   what levers do I pull to get them to engage?
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.360]   What you're naturally doing in that role
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.880]   is testing the audience, testing mediums,
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:14.800]   testing messages or vehicles or technology or whatever.
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:18.280]   And whether you're intentional about it or not,
[00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:20.640]   you're grabbing all of this experience
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:23.240]   that can in itself put you into a channel,
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.560]   whether it's email marketing or whatever it is, right?
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:29.320]   But you walk away so well-rounded
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:32.120]   that typically like as a hiring manager,
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:33.800]   we're trying to hire someone from these days,
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.040]   like a lot of it goes into the mindset,
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.360]   like what drives you?
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.240]   And if you came across my way and you say,
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.320]   hey, look, I care about the customer,
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:42.320]   I care about learning,
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:45.480]   and I just wanna figure out how to get them to engage,
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.880]   that mindset can propel you to a point
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:50.640]   where you're driving a leadership role eventually.
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.160]   'Cause again, it's the mindset
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.160]   and having that round baseline
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.320]   allows you to work with a lot of cross-functional teams
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:00.480]   as opposed to just going narrow really quickly.
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:01.720]   And now, again, there's nothing wrong
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:02.840]   with being a subject matter expert,
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.440]   that's actually fantastic as well.
[00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:07.280]   But the well-roundedness of a generalist
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:09.720]   allows you to use a launching point
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.720]   to do just a lot of really cool things.
[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:15.280]   - I think it also helps you become a translator
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:16.400]   among those specialists.
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.360]   So I get brought in a lot
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:20.760]   where I've got a bunch of specialists in a meeting
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:23.200]   and then they throw me in to be like,
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.600]   how does all of this connect?
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:26.360]   Like we each know our thing
[00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:28.160]   and there are a number of my colleagues
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.640]   who can do it better, faster, and cheaper than me
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:32.680]   in one specific area.
[00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:35.120]   But if you want somebody who can connect all the dots,
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.600]   I'm a great person to add to your meeting.
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.920]   I had the experience, this was years ago at this point,
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:42.800]   but we're all sitting around a room
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.480]   and they're trying to solve this problem.
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:46.560]   And I don't know if you've seen the meme
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.040]   that's basically how to draw an owl.
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:52.240]   And it's like step one, draw two circles.
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.960]   Step two, draw the rest of the owl.
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.760]   And it's like the most lifelike detailed,
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:57.600]   it looks like a photograph.
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:01.280]   And you're like, there are a lot of steps
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:04.760]   between draw two circles and an owl that looks like this.
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:05.880]   So I'm sitting in this room
[00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:08.240]   and I'm listening to all of these people
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:11.040]   who know how to draw their specific bird.
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:14.800]   Like they can go from the two circles of an owl
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.240]   to a realistic owl.
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:19.440]   They can go from two circles and it becomes an eagle
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.960]   or two circles and it becomes a hawk.
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:24.080]   The problem was they didn't realize
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.240]   that they were all drawing different birds.
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.880]   And so they were kind of arguing and it was like,
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:29.560]   well, no, it's this and no, it's that.
[00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:32.480]   And I'm sitting there listening and I'm like,
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.400]   I think that they don't understand
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.640]   that they're actually drawing different birds
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:38.440]   because they all kind of recognize
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:40.160]   that they're talking about birds,
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.960]   but they're so knowledgeable
[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:47.080]   about their specific species of bird
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:47.920]   that they don't realize
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:49.920]   that they're talking about different birds, right?
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:54.360]   I am not an expert in drawing owls or eagles or hawks,
[00:13:54.360 --> 00:14:00.280]   but I am an expert in recognizing what these will become
[00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:03.560]   and helping them kind of translate and saying,
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:06.960]   listen, you're over here trying to draw this curved beak,
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:07.800]   right?
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.440]   And this person is over here drawing a flat bill
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:10.880]   because it's actually a duck.
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:13.480]   Let me explain to you about the differences.
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.600]   And so that was the value that I could add
[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:18.480]   was actually helping them to translate
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:19.880]   that they're drawing different birds,
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:21.080]   here's the differences,
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:24.680]   here's why it matters that we draw this bird or that bird,
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:25.520]   right?
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:26.800]   That was the big value add.
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:30.200]   But it was just a fascinating moment to sit there
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:31.920]   and be like, sorry, why am I here?
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:34.200]   You have a lot of expertise in this room.
[00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:35.520]   And then as I listened, I was like,
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:39.400]   oh, this is why I'm here.
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:42.760]   - Yeah, you know, I wish I got that kind of insight
[00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:45.080]   or feedback early on in my career.
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:47.160]   You know, 'cause I don't know anyone who's listening
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:48.360]   to this can relate to this,
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:50.680]   but like when I graduated out of college,
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:52.200]   obviously there's no experience on my resume
[00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.480]   that I can speak of, right?
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:55.920]   And I know that like communication skills
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:57.920]   seems to be something I was strong in,
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.520]   but it comes really weird on a resume.
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:01.360]   As a matter of fact,
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.000]   it doesn't even make it on as a bullet point.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.120]   And you kind of feel like, what do I do with that, right?
[00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:07.280]   Like, is there any value in that?
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:09.000]   I think what you're articulating here is like, yes,
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.320]   like communication skill described in a different way
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.600]   as the ability to understand
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.440]   what multiple different functions
[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:19.760]   or departments are trying to figure out
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:23.080]   and being the connective tissue that becomes a translator
[00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:27.040]   that enables them to move forward towards a common goal.
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:28.280]   That's what generalists can do.
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:30.800]   And that's super powerful.
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:33.000]   I'm thinking even on my own personal experience,
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.520]   you know, many, many years later, you know, like you,
[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:37.720]   starting off in a,
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.560]   I started off in the world of project management
[00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:41.680]   and project management is also a great way
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:43.880]   to go deep and wide.
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:46.640]   And just like you kind of interacting with developers,
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:50.240]   designers, project managers, like peers or product,
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:53.600]   taking me to a point where, you know, like a few years ago,
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:56.040]   so my role at the time was like senior director
[00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:57.440]   of web and digital.
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.280]   And I was brought into a meeting to solve something
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:01.120]   that was not even within my purview, right?
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:04.640]   There was a issue that in this case,
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:05.880]   I'm not gonna obviously,
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:07.800]   you're not gonna use the name of the company,
[00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:11.080]   but there was an opportunity to optimize the sales process.
[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:13.200]   Something was happening with the leads.
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.760]   I am not an SFDC expert.
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:15.800]   I've never have been.
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:18.240]   I would never pay myself to do that.
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:19.880]   But when you're sitting in a room saying,
[00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:22.760]   okay, I've talked to sales people before.
[00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:24.720]   I've talked to sales engineers before.
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:28.120]   Okay, I've talked to people in the technology stack.
[00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:29.960]   So now as they're trying to figure out like,
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:32.320]   what, where's the leaky bucket?
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:34.440]   And they're kind of speaking across each other
[00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:36.920]   'cause some of these problems existed for many, many years.
[00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:38.720]   So there's politics at play as well.
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.200]   Like there's finger pointing.
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.560]   It allows a generalist like me in that position to be like,
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:45.080]   hey, pull back for a second.
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:47.080]   Are we talking about this?
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.680]   Like, am I categorizing the problem statement?
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:50.520]   Yes.
[00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:52.520]   Okay, well, are we in agreement that like,
[00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:55.080]   this is the problem we're trying to solve?
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:55.920]   And if it's yes,
[00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:57.200]   then it seems like these other things
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:58.360]   you guys are talking about
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.400]   are a little bit less than party.
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:00.240]   Is that true?
[00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:01.080]   Yes. Oh, cool.
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:03.200]   Okay, well, let's shift the conversation here then.
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:05.120]   Again, I'm not saying anything intelligent.
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:07.600]   I'm just being like a translator, right?
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:09.880]   And then it ends up revealing,
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:12.640]   oh, it seems like it's a technical issue.
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.400]   Great, then what do we need to do that?
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.680]   Again, to your point,
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:16.800]   I'm not bringing anything to the table.
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:17.640]   As a matter of fact,
[00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:18.840]   none of these solutions have anything to do with
[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:20.440]   that I'm responsible for.
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:21.280]   But at the end,
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:23.600]   I'm in a position where I'm driving the tiger team.
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:24.440]   And I think to your point,
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:29.440]   that's the essential generalist right there, right?
[00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:31.440]   And just having the spectrum
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:33.360]   to kind of pull people together.
[00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:35.160]   - Yeah, I think it's interesting too.
[00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:37.000]   I think a lot of people,
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.080]   especially whenever they're trying to think about
[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:40.000]   putting this on a resume,
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.840]   they'll write excellent verbal
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:43.520]   and written communication skills.
[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:47.000]   Everybody is gonna say that.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:47.840]   - Yes.
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:50.560]   - The connective tissue, the translator, the bridge builder,
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:53.440]   ability to get executive buy-in,
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:56.240]   ability to speak to different audiences.
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:58.560]   Those are the interesting things.
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:00.840]   And especially if you have proof points of that,
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:04.520]   where you say, ran the tiger team consisting of
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:08.400]   these three other crafts to solve this problem.
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:11.400]   You don't have to say experienced communicator
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:14.360]   with 15 years of verbal and written experience, right?
[00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:15.920]   Nobody cares about that.
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:18.160]   They care about the outcome you were able to achieve.
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:19.640]   And I think that was something,
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:22.600]   especially for me being able to tell those stories
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:25.000]   of the different types of people I've managed.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.120]   I've had a bunch of different specialists
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:28.880]   who've reported into me.
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:31.920]   And when you look at the types of teams I've managed,
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:35.040]   that starts to speak to my expertise
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:38.160]   and ability to connect and ability to communicate
[00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:41.520]   versus me saying, ability to manage different crafts.
[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:44.440]   It's like, okay, so you have expertise in that?
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:45.800]   You do that?
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:48.160]   Like, what do you do versus saying,
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.680]   these are the types of deliverables, the types of teams,
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:54.200]   the types of talent that I've helped lead and develop.
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.000]   That's the thing that signals it to you.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:56.920]   So I would say too,
[00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:59.080]   it's interesting when you think about translating it
[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:01.560]   beyond just excellent written and verbal skills,
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:03.880]   like you see in the job description.
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:08.120]   How do you translate that into outcomes and actions
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:10.840]   that you take when you're in a role?
[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:12.320]   - Yeah, I totally agree.
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:15.120]   As a matter of fact, even projecting on myself,
[00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:17.040]   I go into interviews very differently now.
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:19.960]   And as a matter of fact, I wish I can rewind 20 years
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:20.880]   and see if it still worked.
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:23.920]   Back then it probably would, because to your point,
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:26.080]   I don't go into any interviews anymore where like,
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:27.680]   here's your job description.
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:30.240]   Here are my job accomplishments.
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:31.920]   Let me show you how they align to each other.
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:33.400]   It's like, no, like no one cares about that, right?
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:36.400]   It's like, here's the outcome that I drove.
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:37.720]   And more interestingly enough,
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:38.920]   let me tell you how I got there.
[00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:41.360]   'Cause like understanding how my brain works,
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.160]   that's what a hiring manager is more interested in.
[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:45.880]   The outcome they can control
[00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:48.880]   by the context and environment, by team.
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:51.560]   How you solve the problem is really, really interesting.
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:53.960]   I think that's where, if you allowed yourself
[00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:56.560]   the opportunity to become a generalist
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:59.160]   and get that broad spectrum of experience,
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:02.320]   how you pull people together or how you align people
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:04.000]   or how you drove efficiency,
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.680]   'cause maybe you observed an extra step in the process
[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:07.520]   and you cut it out.
[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:10.040]   Now like, all of a sudden you're like,
[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:11.880]   your product life cycle process and launch
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:14.880]   just got 20% faster 'cause you cut unnecessary stuff.
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.960]   Like those are really, really valuable.
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:18.120]   So Ashley, I'm curious,
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:19.960]   'cause you mentioned like in the beginning of your career,
[00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:22.640]   obviously you kind of dabbled into a lot of things.
[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:25.000]   You mentioned being passionate about the audience
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.200]   and how that then kind of spurred in different avenues.
[00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:31.280]   Can you actually help us understand even more in depth,
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:33.760]   like which areas really called out to you
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:35.640]   that started becoming the foundation
[00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:38.800]   of maybe discovering what you're passionate about
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:41.400]   and allowing yourself to kind of experience that breadth?
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:44.880]   - I think one of the biggest things is that
[00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:45.720]   early in my career,
[00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:48.920]   I didn't have the choice of where I worked
[00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:50.440]   and who I worked with.
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:52.520]   And so because of that,
[00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:54.400]   if I wanted to enjoy going to work every day,
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:57.480]   if I wanted to enjoy the tasks I was doing,
[00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:00.680]   if I wanted to feel like I was accomplishing something,
[00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:02.440]   I needed to go beyond just,
[00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:05.040]   I personally use this product
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:08.120]   or see value from this technology.
[00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:10.040]   So we didn't have solar panels.
[00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:11.720]   Like I wasn't installing solar panels.
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:13.560]   I don't know anything about solar, right?
[00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:16.600]   Until I got in and I started realizing
[00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:18.960]   that the value of renewable energy
[00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:23.560]   and there's some nerdy pricing models
[00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:25.160]   with California energy
[00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:28.280]   that like make this particularly interesting here, right?
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:29.480]   And so that was something where I was like,
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:31.520]   okay, what is the unique thing here
[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:33.600]   that I can kind of grab onto?
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:35.880]   I remember when I was in aviation,
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:37.160]   I was in marketing.
[00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:39.080]   I was the only marketing person.
[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:40.840]   I actually worked for the parent company,
[00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:42.200]   which was only like three people.
[00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:45.640]   But so all of the child companies were bigger
[00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:48.280]   and I was the only marketing person for all of them.
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:51.240]   And so it was this very weird thing where it was like,
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:52.680]   I'm kind of part of the culture.
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:54.320]   I'm kind of part of the business,
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:58.520]   but I'm not fully immersed and I'm kind of an odd ball.
[00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:01.360]   And so I got tasked with helping to decorate the office
[00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:03.480]   because we were in this space.
[00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:05.960]   And it turns out that part of the reason
[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:08.000]   we needed to decorate the space
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.640]   is that when clients would come,
[00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:13.840]   they felt like we were kind of a fly-by-night shop
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:17.040]   because it didn't look like we were settled into the office.
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:18.800]   It looked like we had just moved in
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:23.040]   and that didn't sell well.
[00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:27.040]   And so there was an element of it where on the surface,
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:28.240]   it would look like, I don't know,
[00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:29.800]   get the marketing girl to do it, right?
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:32.160]   She's young, make her buy some pictures, right?
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:34.120]   But when you dig in and you find out that actually
[00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:37.080]   this is impacting our ability to close deals
[00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:40.400]   because we can't really invite people to our office.
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:42.080]   They don't feel comfortable.
[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:45.960]   And it's kind of just, it just doesn't look nice.
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:47.280]   And so they don't feel comfortable.
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:51.560]   And again, this was 15 years ago and aviation is old school.
[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:53.440]   Man, like they're still wearing their suits
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:56.760]   and their polo shirts and like doing business in person.
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:59.640]   If you can't invite your customers to your office,
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:01.280]   that's a problem.
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:04.760]   And so I started pulling things together
[00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:07.520]   and it ended up being kind of this culture thing
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:10.080]   where people would ask like, Ashley, hi, yeah,
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:12.840]   I noticed you were putting up some pictures in this space.
[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:15.880]   Like, are there gonna be any in my hallway?
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:17.720]   And so it started to really bring people together.
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:20.760]   And that's how I started to develop the relationships
[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:23.520]   with the sales reps and with our manufacturing lead
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:25.480]   and with our shop floor lead.
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:27.360]   And that way, when I then came around and said,
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:30.360]   hey guys, there's this new thing called LinkedIn.
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:33.120]   This is how we start to build relationships
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.760]   to go for bigger deals.
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:37.560]   I had built that credibility that they were like,
[00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:39.120]   all right, you can take our headshots.
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:40.520]   You can put us on LinkedIn, right?
[00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:41.680]   You can help us with LinkedIn.
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:44.120]   So I think that's the big thing for me
[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:48.840]   is that willingness to do some of the work early on
[00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:53.840]   that on the surface looked boring or looked like busy work,
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:57.640]   but actually finding out that that's a way
[00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:59.320]   to build relationships with people.
[00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:01.800]   And so that's something that's been positive
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:04.440]   throughout my career of being willing
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:06.600]   to find the interesting stories.
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:09.920]   Like, I wanna do interesting work for myself.
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:14.080]   That probably means that whoever is consuming this work
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:16.640]   also wants to feel interested in it, right?
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:17.480]   You know? - Yeah.
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:20.680]   - And I hear this a lot from people of like,
[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:22.240]   oh, that audience is boring.
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:23.840]   Or like, oh, that product is boring.
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:26.920]   And I'm like, it's not boring to somebody.
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:29.360]   Somebody thinks this is interesting.
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:32.920]   Somebody is thrilled that this problem got solved.
[00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:36.160]   Plenty of people think what I do is boring.
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:37.880]   So if we flip that around, right,
[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:39.760]   there's something interesting.
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:41.560]   There's a human behind the screen.
[00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:43.880]   Somebody thinks this is interesting.
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:45.480]   Why are they so excited about it?
[00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:48.680]   And can I draft off of some of that excitement?
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:49.960]   - Yeah, that is so cool.
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:52.440]   And I even think of the world of like Marvel
[00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:53.880]   with parallel universes, right?
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:57.280]   Like one single decision can branch off on so many things.
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:59.520]   'Cause as you're talking through that, it made me think.
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:02.520]   So like, taking the opportunity to notice,
[00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:05.960]   hey, our office space needs to feel more welcoming, right?
[00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:07.640]   And you kind of do all things.
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:10.520]   That in itself as a generalist activity
[00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:12.720]   could have branched you into different universes.
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:15.240]   You could have spun that as, hey, you know what?
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:17.480]   This is actually about brand building.
[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:20.640]   So maybe brand and comms becomes a passion area
[00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:22.400]   you kind of branch off into.
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:23.720]   If it's around attracting customers,
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:25.160]   maybe that becomes event planning,
[00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:30.000]   or campaigns, or demand gen, or maybe regional sales.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.760]   There's another branch for you, right?
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:32.600]   Maybe it's around,
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:35.000]   because you're talking about bringing people to the office,
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.480]   that could become an HR function, right?
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:39.720]   And so like everything that you do,
[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:41.080]   like I think that universe,
[00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:42.440]   the underlying theme you mentioned
[00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:45.080]   is like a hunger or desire to kind of learn
[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:48.200]   and extract the most you can out of any situation
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:49.520]   with intent.
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:51.280]   And then you can go kind of figure some stuff out.
[00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:53.320]   'Cause I think early in my career,
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:55.840]   that's probably the one thing that did right
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:57.920]   amongst all of the things I did wrong.
[00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:00.920]   'Cause like I graduated during recession
[00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:01.960]   and like nothing was happening.
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:04.360]   So I took all these really random oddball jobs,
[00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:06.920]   which on the surface was the least glamorous thing, right?
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:09.440]   Like it ranged from like call center to whatever.
[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:13.440]   But I challenged myself with every single role that I took
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:16.600]   to at least get one major learning out of it.
[00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:17.440]   So for call center,
[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:20.680]   I overcame the fear of cold calling and rejection, right?
[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:22.480]   I had a content entry job.
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:24.560]   My words per minute typing went up, you know?
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:27.880]   So like, but all these things then cascade
[00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:30.120]   and build up into who I am today.
[00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:35.120]   And I'm glad that I took a chance to go broad,
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:36.680]   to experience all these things.
[00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:38.240]   And quite frankly, sometimes you rule stuff out as well.
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:40.880]   It's like, oh, that's totally not for me, you know?
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:43.680]   School ruled out medicine for me, you know?
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:44.720]   Because I just couldn't do it.
[00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:47.080]   I wouldn't have known if I didn't try.
[00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:49.080]   But yeah, I think what I'm hearing from you
[00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:49.920]   is kind of similar to me.
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:52.320]   These things start building up for relationships.
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.960]   For you, you kind of discover a platform like LinkedIn.
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:56.440]   You build a brand for yourself now.
[00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:58.280]   You have credibility.
[00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:00.920]   And that overall experience allows you,
[00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:03.240]   it propels you to do a lot of things.
[00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:05.080]   So where did you go from there then, Ashley?
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:07.240]   So now like you just discovered one channel
[00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:08.840]   or one avenue you're interested in.
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:12.240]   Is that where you double down on or where else did you go?
[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:15.120]   - I mean, I kept, I was in smaller companies and startups.
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:16.440]   So I continued down that path.
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:21.440]   I would say, I think I kind of like found my people
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:23.640]   when I was working at Duarte.
[00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:26.360]   So it was a presentation design and training firm.
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:28.240]   I had a graphic designer, project manager,
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:30.760]   and a writer on my team and a videographer.
[00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:33.600]   So again, like this very interesting mix of skills
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:36.480]   that were not core marketers.
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:37.680]   I was kind of the only marketer.
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:38.600]   My boss was a marketer,
[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:41.720]   but she was off trying to build another part of the business.
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:43.120]   And she was like, listen, I just need somebody
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:43.960]   who can get in here and do this.
[00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:44.840]   So I did email.
[00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:46.120]   I did social media.
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:47.360]   I did PR.
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:48.680]   I was doing branding stuff.
[00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:53.040]   We were doing a mix of like high touch kind of sales stuff.
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:54.440]   So like I brought in Marketo
[00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:56.880]   when HubSpot into that organization at the time,
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:58.800]   I was helping to do events.
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:27:59.880]   We did book marketing.
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:03.280]   So our CEO, Nancy Duarte had written several books.
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:04.760]   So I helped her launch those books.
[00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:06.600]   I hosted the events in the office, right?
[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:09.480]   Like I got a chance to do everything.
[00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:12.560]   And I think that, you know, I had been doing a lot of that
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:14.720]   at the previous two companies where I was doing email
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:16.760]   and starting to bring people into social
[00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:17.600]   and that kind of thing.
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:20.880]   And I think those staying in small companies.
[00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:23.520]   And then again, I was at two security startups.
[00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:25.800]   So like, I just didn't have the luxury of being like,
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:29.160]   I only want to do this one thing.
[00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:31.920]   I've, you know, started to specialize a little bit
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:34.440]   at Atlassian, but even still I've gotten the chance
[00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:36.440]   to do more of the product marketing.
[00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:40.080]   My title is literally integrated.
[00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:41.600]   It's been integrated twice now.
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:44.200]   I was senior manager of integrated media.
[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:47.000]   Then I like sort of specialized,
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.400]   whatever you want to call it in content strategy.
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:54.240]   And again, that does still include email, social media,
[00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:55.760]   presentations, you know,
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:58.480]   a variety of different content marketing types.
[00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:01.440]   Now I'm back to like integrated product marketing.
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:06.240]   So I think that every time I start to get too specialized,
[00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:09.360]   I'm like, why is there only one audience?
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:10.600]   Why is there only one channel?
[00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:12.080]   Why is there only one deliverable?
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:14.280]   And I start to be like, all right guys,
[00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:17.840]   can't let my skills get dull in these other areas.
[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:20.360]   And I do think that I take a pretty broad approach,
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:23.840]   even in those cases of like, you know,
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:26.120]   looking at onboarding journeys or, you know,
[00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:28.400]   doing demos and tutorials that might not
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:30.720]   traditionally be considered.
[00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:33.240]   Content marketing is a weird space.
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:35.600]   I think it's like a catch-all term.
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:38.720]   I feel like that's almost a generalist space in itself,
[00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:41.840]   but I actually do have fairly deep expertise
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:43.200]   in social media.
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:47.200]   And so the people who use social media
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:51.520]   as a distribution channel in their content strategy
[00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:54.160]   versus a separate channel, influencer marketing,
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:57.280]   community building, like basically treating it
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:00.440]   as its own strategy would probably look at the way
[00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:02.200]   I treat both of those and say, okay,
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:05.800]   those are actually quite separate and they are specialists.
[00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:07.640]   The way I do them is more of a generalist,
[00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:09.560]   very connected, integrated way.
[00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:14.520]   So I think just that ability to stay generalist
[00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:17.200]   and to know what I want and being willing to stick my nose
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:18.360]   in other people's business,
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:21.840]   that's how I switched teams internally a couple of times
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:25.240]   at Atlassian because I've worked with a team
[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:28.200]   and they're like, should you do this?
[00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:31.680]   Like, do we need this all the time?
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:37.320]   Maybe let's bring that over or let's add this to your role
[00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:41.880]   or let's combine these two things so that it becomes a role
[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:44.320]   for you or something like that to say, hey, we need this.
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:47.040]   We had somebody who's doing like three out of the five,
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:48.040]   you can do all five.
[00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:50.040]   Like we're gonna restructure this a bit.
[00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:52.840]   So it's been an interesting journey,
[00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:55.720]   especially in a bigger company where I am surrounded
[00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:59.480]   by phenomenal specialists in a variety of different areas.
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:02.600]   And so that ability to keep connecting the dots,
[00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:05.960]   having a variety of different crafts and skills
[00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:09.720]   and expertise on my team and helping them grow.
[00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:12.280]   And then being somebody, the other nice thing about it
[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:14.560]   is that I can play as a team.
[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:16.880]   That's one of our values really well
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:20.520]   because my goals are horizontal.
[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:25.120]   And so if you have something that you can't really get done
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:27.680]   because it doesn't achieve your goals,
[00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:29.480]   it probably helps achieve my goals.
[00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:33.360]   And so I can help you get stuff done across the organization
[00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:37.800]   because I'm not beholden to a single vertical goal.
[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:39.160]   So it's actually a superpower
[00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:41.640]   to have a mix of generalists and specialists
[00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:44.560]   because the specialists are doing amazing work
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:45.880]   on this one goal.
[00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:48.640]   And the generalists are connecting across
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:50.800]   to do amazing work across all of these goals.
[00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:52.560]   So it's actually a really nice pairing.
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:55.880]   Again, I'm not trying to hate on specialists.
[00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:58.680]   I'm trying to combat a little bit of that like,
[00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:00.480]   ah, specialists own the world.
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:02.240]   You can only succeed as a specialist.
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:03.680]   And I'm like, I don't know,
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:05.440]   I feel like you can succeed as a generalist.
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:08.840]   And here's how they pair really well together.
[00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:11.080]   Where you are in terms of your career maturity,
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:14.760]   your company maturity, your team size, your goals.
[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:17.520]   Yes, that's gonna depend on the mix that you need,
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:20.840]   but you gotta have some generalists in there.
[00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:23.120]   Like it's so helpful.
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:28.200]   - Is there a dark side to being a generalist?
[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:31.800]   And I'm gonna make up an example and maybe this is real.
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:37.720]   The fear of if I'm potentially spreading myself thin
[00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:42.000]   or reaching beyond where I have legitimate experience
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.040]   as I'm poking my nose into stuff, can it ever backfire?
[00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:48.600]   You know, it could be a lack of executional expertise.
[00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:51.280]   And so now I went far, but kind of backfired
[00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:54.080]   or maybe I went somewhere that I shouldn't have.
[00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:56.000]   And now kind of, again, it's not going my way.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.360]   Is there the downside to this?
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:01.840]   - 100% there's a downside to this.
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:06.680]   So if, I mean, LinkedIn is an excellent example, right?
[00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:10.840]   Numerous people have asked me why I don't niche down
[00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:13.000]   and has said, if you wanna keep growing,
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.360]   you've gotta niche down.
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:15.920]   What do you do?
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:16.880]   What do you want?
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:19.040]   Who do you serve?
[00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:20.960]   And I'm like, well, I do all the things
[00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:23.200]   and I serve all the people and I want all the things.
[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:24.440]   And they're like, okay,
[00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:26.600]   but at some point you have to pick, right?
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.040]   I would say that to your point
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:32.400]   about spreading yourself too thin,
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:35.680]   that is something that is a continued growth area for me
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:38.800]   in terms of prioritization, saying no.
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:42.360]   I get excited about kind of the next new thing.
[00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:45.040]   And so I'm constantly like, what's going on over there?
[00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:46.800]   Could we somehow bring it in over here?
[00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:49.960]   And can I just like do that?
[00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:51.640]   And sometimes the answer is, yeah, sure.
[00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:53.760]   Low consequences, get it done, try it out.
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:54.960]   We'll see if it works.
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:56.800]   Obviously there are other times
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:59.800]   where that might have high consequences.
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:03.240]   And if you are not cautious and saying,
[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:05.720]   okay, let's look at this.
[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:08.280]   Does this actually require a specialist?
[00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:10.560]   I think that can be hard.
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:14.840]   You can not go deep enough, not explore enough,
[00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:16.800]   potentially get yourself into hot water.
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:18.080]   I have been very fortunate
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:20.680]   to have some excellent specialist partners
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:22.560]   that if I'm coming in and it's something
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:26.600]   that is a solved problem within another specialty,
[00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:28.560]   but is maybe new to the organization
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:31.920]   or it's a new use case, then I'm able to pair.
[00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:34.040]   If it's completely not new, that's a separate issue.
[00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:35.640]   And I'm a great person to do that.
[00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:38.520]   'Cause I'm like, can't mess it up that bad.
[00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:40.440]   Like probably gonna be okay, right?
[00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:46.080]   And then I think in terms of,
[00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:49.800]   particularly if you have a very specific niche skill set
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:54.800]   and you are very rare in how you provide that skill,
[00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:57.480]   yeah, you can make a lot of money
[00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:59.120]   if you can tell that story and you can say,
[00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:02.760]   hey, I'm like one of five people who can do this one thing.
[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:05.080]   You can make a boatload of money doing that.
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:09.160]   And it is a harder story to tell as a generalist,
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:12.000]   particularly if you're in your early or mid career.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.160]   Think once you start getting into leadership levels,
[00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:15.000]   you've seen it all,
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.320]   you've managed different types of people,
[00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:18.120]   you've run into different types of problems,
[00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:19.400]   that's an easier story.
[00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:22.280]   But for early to mid career folks,
[00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:24.280]   the general story is harder to tell.
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:28.840]   And so maximizing your compensation and your offering
[00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:31.080]   can be a lot more difficult than if you come in
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:34.080]   and you're like, I've literally seen every permutation
[00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:37.640]   of this specific problem versus saying,
[00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:39.680]   I can connect the dots, I can learn,
[00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:41.600]   I'm curious, I'm adaptable.
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:43.880]   I've seen a bunch of different types of problems.
[00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:46.800]   Here's a bunch of different types of solutions.
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:49.680]   That can be a much harder story to tell.
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:52.000]   And so from a compensation
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   and a career trajectory standpoint,
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.600]   you have to be strategic
[00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:58.560]   about how you're telling that story.
[00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:00.600]   You can't just flop around and be like,
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:02.320]   yeah, I can do any job.
[00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:03.960]   That's not a generalist.
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:05.600]   That's a different,
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:07.440]   that's not a story that's gonna resonate.
[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:09.200]   I don't know, any job will do, right?
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:11.360]   I'm gonna apply for a head of brand
[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:12.600]   and a head of product marketing
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:14.120]   and a head of communications
[00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:16.400]   and a head of social media.
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:19.880]   And it's like, that is a lot of head ofs
[00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:24.000]   that you're just gonna apply for all the jobs here.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.680]   That is a much harder story to tell
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:28.400]   than either smaller companies,
[00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:29.600]   like a director of marketing
[00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:31.480]   or VP of marketing of a smaller company
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:34.240]   where they want that breadth of experience.
[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:35.840]   - Yeah, I totally agree with all of that.
[00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:39.720]   And I think the trap I fell into early in my career
[00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:42.280]   in a mission to become a generalist,
[00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:45.160]   so the intent was good,
[00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:47.560]   I spread myself way too thin as well.
[00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:50.080]   So I ran out of hours in the day
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:52.320]   and I started burning the midnight candle.
[00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:55.920]   And so it became a self-fulfilling prophecy
[00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:58.040]   where like the more success I gained,
[00:36:58.040 --> 00:36:59.200]   the more work I added,
[00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:00.600]   and then things start suffering
[00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:02.200]   'cause then people are wondering,
[00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:03.640]   oh, Tim, are you supposed to be doing this?
[00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:04.720]   Well, let me give you more of that then.
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:05.560]   And it's like, okay, well,
[00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:07.480]   that's taking me away from my core job now
[00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:08.960]   because to your point, there is a need.
[00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:10.400]   Someone needs that help
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:12.600]   and I'll take all the free need I can get,
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:14.520]   but it put me in conflict with my manager at the time.
[00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:15.920]   They're like, why are you doing that?
[00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:18.040]   Like, I specifically told you to do this thing,
[00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:18.880]   now you're doing this.
[00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:22.400]   And so that looked poorly on me early on in my career.
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:23.240]   So I think you're right.
[00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:24.440]   I think having a really good point of view
[00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:27.280]   on what you're trying to do,
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:28.480]   so even though you're a generalist,
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:31.400]   there's still gotta be some kind of direction.
[00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:33.200]   I think the storytelling piece of that,
[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:34.640]   well, that comes with age as well.
[00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:36.400]   Like as we mature, we have more context,
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:40.080]   but I think, again, for those who are early in their careers
[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:42.760]   hearing this, start thinking about that story
[00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:44.040]   and how you're crafting your journey
[00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:45.000]   'cause people will be interested.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.240]   But again, how you're getting from A to B
[00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:50.360]   and the decisions you make become really, really important.
[00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:53.240]   So these are all kind of foundational pieces of that.
[00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:56.120]   - Yeah, I think the other thing that's funny,
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:58.280]   I have these conversations fairly frequently now
[00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:00.360]   where people are like, you've done all this different stuff
[00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:02.840]   and how did you decide and how did you do it?
[00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:05.640]   Yeah, sure, I can look back and be like,
[00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:08.120]   oh, this was the common thread, right?
[00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:10.720]   I can look back and say, this is the common skill.
[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:13.840]   This is the thing that made it happen.
[00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:15.400]   I didn't know that 10 years ago.
[00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:17.680]   I didn't know that 15 years ago.
[00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:21.000]   I'm looking back on that and drawing those threads
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.480]   and drawing those parallels.
[00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:25.360]   And I think that especially for folks
[00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:27.320]   who are earlier in their career,
[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:30.080]   it's gonna take you some time.
[00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:32.960]   And this was something I actually did an Ask Me Anything
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:35.560]   with some high school students at one point.
[00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:36.400]   And they asked me, they're like,
[00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:39.360]   how did you know that marketing was your life's purpose?
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:42.800]   And I was like, whoa, I'm gonna stop you right there.
[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:45.240]   Marketing is not my life's purpose.
[00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:49.640]   You're 17 years old.
[00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:52.000]   You can switch majors.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.480]   You can pick a major and never work a day in your field.
[00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:57.800]   You can go and work in that field
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:59.480]   and actually decide that it turns out
[00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:01.600]   that the work is not interesting.
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:03.720]   You can go back to school.
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:05.240]   You could become an entrepreneur.
[00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:08.800]   And they were just like, thank you, right?
[00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:13.800]   I was like, this idea that we go on this linear journey
[00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:16.080]   and we get good grades and we pick our major
[00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:19.280]   at 17 years old, 'cause you have to apply to college
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:21.400]   like the summer before or whatever,
[00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:24.120]   like summer after your junior year.
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:25.640]   You don't freaking know anything.
[00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:27.960]   I started college as a musical theater major, right?
[00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:32.960]   Like you don't know things at 17, right?
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:34.800]   I'm an oddball because I actually got
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:36.320]   an undergraduate marketing degree
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:38.440]   and I've worked my whole career in marketing.
[00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:39.840]   People are like, what?
[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:41.720]   You did the thing with your degree?
[00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:42.760]   This is fascinating.
[00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:45.040]   So I think that's the other thing I would say
[00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:47.800]   is that looking at a journey like mine,
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:49.800]   and I'm sure it sounds like you've got the same thing
[00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:51.000]   where you're like, oh, I can look back
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.600]   and here's all the lessons that I learned.
[00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:55.240]   And it's like, wow, that Tim guy,
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:57.600]   he really crafted a great career.
[00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:01.200]   And you're like, I mean, I tried to make smart moves,
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:05.600]   but it was in a recession and I took the job I could take
[00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:07.440]   and I made money and I tried to make the best of it.
[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:11.360]   And there's not a perfect path.
[00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:13.200]   And as much as, I mean, I still deal with this.
[00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:15.920]   I look at people who are further along than me
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:18.480]   and I'm like, man, they've got it figured out.
[00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:21.040]   If I could just do what they did,
[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:24.000]   but I can't because that's not my journey.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.520]   My journey is my journey.
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:27.600]   And looking back on it, I can draw the threads,
[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:28.560]   but I don't know.
[00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:30.040]   I think every so often,
[00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:31.680]   I'm managing some early career folks now
[00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:34.040]   and I just wanna tell them like, it's gonna be okay.
[00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:38.360]   Like you're doing fine for yourself.
[00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:40.280]   I'm happy to help, I'm happy to answer,
[00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:44.240]   but get a long career and it's gonna be okay.
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:45.880]   - Yeah, that's so funny.
[00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:48.120]   I love that 'cause you're totally right
[00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:50.600]   in terms of like that being my career story as well.
[00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:52.720]   'Cause I wrote, it hasn't been released yet,
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:54.720]   at least at the time of this recording,
[00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:57.120]   but I recorded a podcast specifically
[00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:59.840]   on all around my failures of my career.
[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:00.760]   'Cause when I thought about it, I was like,
[00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:02.440]   man, it was a lot.
[00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:06.240]   And ranging all the way back to like academic choices
[00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:09.840]   and it's all those small pivot points
[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:11.120]   that you kind of figure out.
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:13.520]   It's like, okay, that didn't work.
[00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:15.360]   Maybe I need to swallow my pride a little bit.
[00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:16.760]   Let me try something else.
[00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:21.480]   And again, the accumulation of all those micro decisions,
[00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:24.480]   good and bad, all should hopefully lead
[00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:25.320]   to something positive.
[00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:28.480]   And I think it's easy to focus on let's say failure
[00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:30.240]   because you tried all these things and they fail.
[00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:32.520]   It's like, oh man, the common thread you see
[00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:33.360]   so far is failure.
[00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:35.520]   It's like, well, actually like all of those have,
[00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:37.960]   like if you can figure out what the underlying problem is,
[00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:40.240]   maybe it's a person, maybe it's a point of view thing
[00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:42.040]   or your outlook or attitude or something like that,
[00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:44.160]   like that can be a micro turning point
[00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:46.320]   where it's just like, if you're 15 years later
[00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:47.520]   and you reflect back, it's like, oh man,
[00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:49.200]   that failure was the best thing that ever happened to me
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:53.040]   'cause it forced me to swallow the pride and whatnot.
[00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:55.120]   And I think you're right in today's age,
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:57.960]   like man, being a student right now
[00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:01.040]   with all the information available to them.
[00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:04.040]   And like, I got two kids, like eight and 10
[00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:07.800]   and the academic expectations are so high.
[00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:10.160]   And like some of it for me is cultural as well, right?
[00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:13.160]   So like being a journalist and in this case being Asian,
[00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:15.560]   that almost like, that doesn't sound like a doctor
[00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:16.400]   or whatever it is.
[00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:18.640]   - Right, it's not a doctor or a lawyer or an engineer.
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:20.720]   - Yeah, that's exactly it.
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:23.120]   I tried all three in college and I failed all three.
[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:24.800]   Marketing is the only thing that made my grade,
[00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:26.680]   like graduate, like I can graduate.
[00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:28.480]   Otherwise I would have flipped out of school.
[00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:31.840]   But yeah, it's the willingness to, again,
[00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:33.960]   maybe it's not the straight path.
[00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:36.400]   There are some careers you do, it's more linear.
[00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:39.040]   Like if you're gonna do like sciences or medicine,
[00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:41.600]   there is definitely an academic path.
[00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:43.520]   That just didn't happen to be my path.
[00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:45.880]   My parents described me as street smart
[00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:50.120]   because I kept, my GPA looked like this.
[00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:52.360]   Whereas my brother, like he went the dental path
[00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:54.600]   and he's academically successful.
[00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:56.080]   But like we're both happy
[00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:58.280]   and we would both describe ourselves as accomplished.
[00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:00.040]   And that's not a financial conversation.
[00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:02.480]   It's a career satisfaction statement, right?
[00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:04.720]   So yeah, I love that.
[00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:08.680]   So power of general marketing or even generalist,
[00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:11.160]   regardless of your field, doesn't even have to be marketing.
[00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:15.360]   It's the mindset of willing to try things and learn things
[00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:16.480]   and make something of it.
[00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:17.720]   I love, that's powerful.
[00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:21.080]   Well, Ashley, I just wanna thank you for this time.
[00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:22.400]   I really had a lot of fun.
[00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:23.880]   And especially hearing about your career journey,
[00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:26.400]   it's always, I feel like we're in the same tribe.
[00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:27.240]   - I know, I know.
[00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:30.600]   Like I found my people, me and Tim, we're in the same boat.
[00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:31.680]   - Well, thank you so much.
[00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:36.000]   Is there anything for people to follow you on
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:36.840]   or are there any kind of,
[00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:38.480]   you mentioned like you have a,
[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:40.480]   obviously a very spiritual life outside of work.
[00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:41.960]   Is there anything that people can follow you on
[00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:43.480]   or discover about you?
[00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:47.120]   - Sure, so I would love to connect with folks on LinkedIn.
[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:47.960]   I'm very active there.
[00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:51.240]   I post and comment and try to keep up with my DMs
[00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:52.360]   and all of that kind of stuff.
[00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:54.160]   So yeah, LinkedIn is a great place.
[00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:57.600]   You can sort of catch me on Twitter,
[00:43:57.600 --> 00:43:59.840]   X, whatever we're calling it these days,
[00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:01.880]   but yeah, primarily LinkedIn.
[00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:03.840]   - I think you are doing a clinic on social selling,
[00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:04.680]   by the way.
[00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:05.880]   I love your posts on LinkedIn.
[00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:07.320]   - Oh, thank you, thank you.
[00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:08.800]   It's fun, it's fun.
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:10.320]   - Cool, well, thanks a lot, Ashley.
[00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:11.160]   - Thanks, Tim.
[00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:13.740]   (upbeat music)
[00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:15.800]   you
