[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.600]   Let's kick it off with an in-depth interview with Nick O'Kelley, author of Live on the Margin.
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.200]   And let's talk about how you can design and live a life of adventure.
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:01:03.200]   ♪
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.720]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast. My name is Joshua Sheets,
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.080]   and today is Monday, February 2, 2015. Welcome to the show.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:20.640]   Today, let's talk about not living the deferred life plan, but rather how you can design and
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.200]   build a life where everything is integrated together and you can enjoy some pretty cool
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.600]   adventures long before 65.
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:35.760]   ♪
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.240]   Nick is a very cool dude, and this is a very cool interview. It's pretty hardcore. We talk a little
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.440]   bit about, well, a lot about financial planning. We talk a little bit about how to fund financial
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:51.760]   planning. We talk a little bit about trading. Nick and his co-author, Patrick Schulte, wrote in the
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.280]   book Live on the Margin and developed this very strange cocktail of personal life advice and
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.040]   trading advice. It's a really interesting book, and I recommend it. I definitely recommend it.
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:09.600]   It's a really fun book, but it's this very strange mixture of stock charts and options trades.
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.640]   Now they all work, combined with life advice, advising you to sell your house and sell all
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:24.640]   your junk and move to a tropical island somewhere. It's quite good. It's quite fun. I'll mention a
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.400]   little bit more on it at the end of the interview if you care to go and buy the book and check it
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.200]   out. I was really thankful that Nick came on the show. I first got in touch with him after I
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.680]   interviewed his co-author, Pat Schulte. If you haven't heard that episode, it's actually episode
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:46.240]   50 of the show. It was entitled From an $8 an hour job after college to financial independence
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:52.080]   at the age of 30 to 10 plus years of global travel with family. You can find that at
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:58.400]   radicalpersonalfinance.com/50. This interview with Nick covers a number of different areas.
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.040]   What I was fascinated to hear is since I wasn't familiar with Nick's story prior to the interview,
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.960]   I was fascinated to pull out of him just some of the twists and turns of his life.
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.880]   As you'll hear in the interview, it's been a very interesting life. Nick is a sailor. He's a pilot.
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:18.880]   He's an entrepreneur. He's done all kinds of interesting things. You're going to enjoy
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.000]   his thoughts on how to integrate those with finance. We even get a little touchy-feely
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.800]   during the middle of the interview, touchy-feely in the sense of a little bit emotional, a little
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.840]   bit of self-help. Be forewarned. Enjoy the interview. I'll be back at the end to wrap
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.600]   things up. Here we go. Nick, welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast. I appreciate
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.280]   you being with me today. Are you kidding me? Thank you for having me. This is an honor.
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.480]   I appreciate it. I'm looking forward to this conversation because we're going to talk a
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.000]   little bit about some of my favorite topics, which is in essence, some down to its own,
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.920]   to the essence of the subject, is how to create an ideal lifestyle at a reasonable age. Not
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:05.280]   necessarily pushing things off until the age of 80 to really live, but how do we create our ideal
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.800]   lifestyle at an earlier age? You and your family, you've been able to do a lot of that. I'd love
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.000]   for you to share as a beginning introduction, I'd love for you to share a little bit about your
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.720]   story and your progression from where you came from as a young person through till today.
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:28.960]   Wow. I feel like we're on a first date and it's the get to know you question.
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.160]   It is a little bit that way.
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:36.240]   I'll be back at all in just a couple minutes without boring people. I was a poor child,
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:44.960]   which came, no. I was raised by hippie parents in the forest in poor towns in Washington. We
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:53.040]   literally cut down a patch of trees and my dad built a house. I don't want to say we were poor,
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:59.200]   maybe financially we didn't have much money growing up. Money was never really a focus for
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:06.800]   me. I was much more of a free spirited child and really only started thinking about what money
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:12.800]   really meant for my lifestyle later in life. I was really free to pursue my passions.
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:20.560]   I originally wanted to be a pilot. Actually, I am a pilot. I went and got the licenses and
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:27.440]   was headed down a commercial track. I spent a summer up in Valdez, Alaska. I didn't have the
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:34.560]   hours to actually fly the bush plane. I was basically a glorified baggage boy and gas man.
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:40.160]   Getting to know those pilots, I came to realize that even the most exciting flying in the world
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:48.720]   still got really boring. I was maybe a little lost for a couple years getting into college.
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:58.640]   I found that I had become fascinated with meteorology, with weather. I got done with
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:04.400]   my undergraduate and went off and got my masters in atmospheric and oceanic sciences. This is where
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:13.600]   I really came into my own in terms of what took me into the trading world and what is, I guess,
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:19.360]   set the stage for some of my financial, I don't want to say success, but some of the skills that
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:27.360]   I learned that allowed me to head off traveling. In meteorology, atmospheric and oceanic sciences,
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:33.760]   I was interested in forecasting, which is predicting the future basically. It's about,
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.200]   well, it's about a couple of things. First of all, it's about pattern recognition.
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:43.440]   Then it's also about some fairly high-level mathematics, geophysical fluid dynamics,
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:48.000]   and statistical analysis, and that sort of thing. I just found that I had this talent for
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:55.920]   predicting the future. I worked as a meteorologist on television for,
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:05.120]   gosh, I think it came out to be 10, 12, 13 years in the San Francisco Bay Area.
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:14.000]   This was at the-- when I first came to the Bay Area, it was the height of the dot-com bubble.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   What I thought was a great salary, working on television, forecasting the weather,
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.840]   it turned out to be not so great because there was a lot of guys, a lot of people my age,
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:32.720]   relatively young, my mid to late 20s, that just seemed to be killing it. They had all these stock
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:41.200]   options. I basically came to trading as a retail investor, just a total noob, just watching CNBC
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:51.760]   and open up an E-Trade account. I just started trading. My trading was not sophisticated at all.
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:08:01.040]   I mean, it's laughable now. I would basically watch the hot stocks, buy them. As soon as people
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:10.640]   started bad-mouthing them, I'd sell. A year later, I don't remember the exact percentages, but I think
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:15.760]   I turned my, I don't know, a few thousand bucks, maybe it was eight, ten grand into like 20.
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:21.600]   I was like, "Wow, this is pretty easy, man." I wasn't trading options. I wasn't trading any
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:26.080]   derivatives or anything. I was just buying securities and selling them when they didn't
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:30.960]   look hot anymore. You were just doing straight long calls. You weren't selling short or anything?
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:43.600]   Oh, right. I didn't even know what that meant. There was a transition. Nothing in life is ever
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:51.440]   very simple. I finally had enough cash in the bank and got a promotion to work. I started thinking
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:56.400]   about, "Oh, I want to buy a house." We were living in a pool house in the Saratoga Hills,
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:02.800]   which was awesome. It was gorgeous. We were in a 400-square-foot pool house, and I still aspired
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:15.760]   to more. We sold out stock. That was coupled with this realization that all those people that I'd
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:21.600]   meet that had these crazy stock options, they were now on their second and third gig, and they were
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:30.960]   looking for the new thing. This is roundabout 2000. We're creeping up on it. I basically accidentally
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:43.040]   sold all my high-tech stock at the height of the bubble. We bought this crummy house. I'm trying
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:52.320]   not to use foul language. I appreciate it. Crummy house in a so-so part of San Francisco. We
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:10:00.160]   started pouring all of our money and blood, sweat, and tears into this junkie house. Everybody around
[00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:07.120]   us was doing the exact same thing. I started to notice a pattern. I was like, "Gosh, if you follow
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:15.200]   the herd a little bit, but you stay ahead of them, you can make some coin here." As my neighborhood
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:22.560]   was improving and everybody was sprucing up the yards and stuff, we finished all the renovations
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:28.400]   we wanted to do. Literally, somebody knocked on the door and said, "You want to sell?"
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:35.680]   We're like, "Okay." We happened to sell basically at the height of the first—people don't really
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:41.360]   remember this—but the first housing bubble, at least in the Bay Area, around about 2002.
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:50.240]   This is where we entered the world of travel. I come from a family of sailors, my aunts and uncles.
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:56.960]   I have a big family, big into sailing, big trans-oceanic sailors. I've always had that dream.
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:07.920]   My wife and I bought a big boat, turned out to be way too big, and moved on board and sold
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:16.400]   everything and headed out for an adventure. Hopefully, my phone's going off. Sorry about that.
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:25.840]   Hopefully, I'm not getting too boring here. When I headed off sailing, I initially thought, "Okay,
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:31.840]   not having an income, quitting my job would be fine," but I really felt this need to continue
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:37.680]   to generate income. Got back into trading and got a little bit more sophisticated about it,
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:46.720]   and slowly dipped my toes into options trading and learned along the way without any real formal
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:56.080]   training. That adventure lasted for a couple years. Then we came back, and I went back into
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:06.480]   television and then felt this need to try my hand at entrepreneurial pursuits. I have this fire.
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:12.880]   I think from listening to you, you have it as well, this need to build my own thing. I don't
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:19.920]   know. It's like an inner rebel or something like that. It's not that I am anti-authority,
[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:23.040]   per se, but it's just I have this need to make this thing of my own.
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:28.800]   It's kind of an adventure. You feel like you can create something. I think many entrepreneurs,
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:35.680]   money is nice, freedom is nice, but many entrepreneurs, it's almost a creative
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:40.480]   outlet to be able to build something that does something that you feel is important
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:44.400]   and be able to stand back and look and say, "There's the work of my hands."
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:50.000]   I'm really glad you said that because having been through a couple entrepreneurial pursuits now,
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:59.760]   I feel that money is a barometer, it's a measuring stick. The successful entrepreneurs that I know,
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:09.120]   they don't go out and start buying a bunch of cool stuff. They are proud of what they've created,
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:13.040]   and they dig the fact that they created it. That's definitely what I came to realize.
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:21.200]   I started this company. It was difficult. I didn't make as much money as I had made in
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:28.320]   television, but I certainly learned a lot about myself and about business. I was
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:37.600]   lucky enough to sell the company in early 2009. This happened to coincide
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:47.520]   with basically some divestiture I had accomplished in 2008, which again,
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:52.240]   happened to time the market very well. You're like the golden boy of market timing.
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:14:00.880]   I'm coming from the Mark Cuban school of thought. A lot of, especially fund managers, will say,
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:05.920]   "Stick your money with me. You can't time the market." I'm like, "No way, man. That's what
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:11.520]   it's all about." If you're paying attention, you absolutely can time the market. It's just
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:17.920]   realizing that the market means different things in different sectors. You can't just say, "The
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:22.480]   market's going up," or, "The market's going down." It's like some parts of the market are going up,
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:28.720]   some are coming down. It just so happened that in 2008, I saw a lot of indicators that told me,
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:39.120]   "It's time to absolutely pull the ripcord on real estate." We had a huge house at the time.
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:47.680]   I said, "We got to get out of this." My wife was in agreement. We initially listed for,
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:55.680]   I can't remember what it was. This was the realtors advising. He said, "I think we'll
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:15:02.880]   initially list it for 1.1." After 30 days, nada, nothing. I was like, "We got to get aggressive."
[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:10.080]   We dropped it like 100K. I think we had two or three buyers come through. This is a fantastic
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:16.880]   house. It's gorgeous. I said, "No, we got to get more aggressive." I can't remember what the next
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:23.680]   cut was, but we bailed out of it. Still a huge profit. When you see that things have turned,
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:29.760]   don't get hesitant. When you see the writing on the wall, you've got to move.
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:36.480]   I was divesting partially because I wanted to put money into my business and partially because
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:46.400]   I could see the market was turning. I sold that business. We went off for another long sale,
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:56.320]   bought another boat, and headed off sailing. Since then, since 2009, we have been what I'd call
[00:15:56.320 --> 00:16:05.040]   part-time adventurers. We usually take two or three long, I wouldn't even say vacations,
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:12.880]   but trips per year, six, eight weeks. My wife and I are working.
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:20.400]   I'd say nine months a year, 10 months a year, sometimes eight months, other years.
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:27.360]   Then we're going off and seeing the world. That's how we do it. When we're traveling,
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:34.320]   I'm much more actively trading. I'm indeed living on the margin, making money while we're on the
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:44.640]   road. Are you primarily taking sailing trips? In the last year and a half, we have a dog.
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:52.640]   We don't have children. We have a dog that we love to death. She is getting older. A year ago,
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:17:00.560]   we realized that she was not liking the boat so much. We bought another small RV. We've had a
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:08.880]   couple RVs. The last few trips have been on the road. Again, I think we talked to OffAir about
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:15.440]   this. We're getting ready for a sailing adventure for this spring. We're going to head north from
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:24.240]   Portland and head up to southeast Alaska or almost to southeast Alaska. We're both going by boat and
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:33.760]   by land. That's neat. What was the timeline? How old are you now? I am 41. The timeline,
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:40.880]   if we go back, you're looking essentially at 10 to 13 years. Was your first major trip
[00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:47.200]   at about the age of 30 after you worked as a meteorologist? I think it was like 28.
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:56.160]   We took off at 28. I won't get specifically into dollar figures, but we were not wealthy. We
[00:17:56.160 --> 00:18:06.160]   weren't retirement wealthy. I think our net worth was probably $300, something like that. We had
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:14.080]   been fortunate with what we had made on the house. I had worked hard. I was making a great salary
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:18.640]   on television. My wife was working in high tech. That's what we initially took off with.
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:23.600]   Our free cash, though, was definitely less than $100. We put way too much into the boat.
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:28.720]   We bought a really expensive boat. You don't have to do that. You can go off and have sailing
[00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:35.680]   adventures on a $10,000 boat. You don't need these big luxuries. I thought we needed everything. The
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:41.280]   boat had a couple of refrigeration systems, scuba compressor, just absolutely everything.
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:46.640]   It had a washer and dryer. Wow. You thought you needed a washer and dryer,
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:52.000]   but the reality is you could probably wear a bathing suit depending on what ocean you're
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:58.320]   sailing, I guess. You don't need many other clothes. No, no, no. My heart was in the right
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:03.280]   place. I had my wife, and I talked about this at length in my first book, Get Her On Board.
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:08.880]   My wife was definitely resistant, as are many wives whose husbands want to go sail the great
[00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:20.320]   oceans. I wanted to recreate the lifestyle we had on land in a boat. I wanted extreme comfort. I
[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:27.200]   wanted really big, at a 50-foot boat, 35,000 pounds, just loaded to the gills. I thought the
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:37.040]   more comfortable she was, the happier we would be. The irony is that a boat that's-- I can back up
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:42.480]   and say any lifestyle that you want to create, an alternative lifestyle, if you make it really big
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:47.200]   and complicated, it's going to wear you down in terms of how much time and energy and money that
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:52.880]   you have to put into maintaining it. This big boat that we had, and this complicated plan to sail
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:20:02.720]   around the world, man, I was working on this thing all the time. It was a heavy load. We came back to
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:08.400]   land-based life. I got an opportunity that I couldn't resist in Denver to come back to
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:16.080]   television, another fast salary and doing weather in a very exciting meteorological place. Denver,
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:21.200]   you have thunderstorms, big snows, big cold, it's hot in the summer, which it was fantastic.
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:28.560]   We came back to land-based life. We've been in and out of this adventure mode almost continuously
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:33.680]   since then. That's basically the lifestyle that we like. We're not full-time adventurers.
[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:40.320]   So, I wish I'd interviewed your wife separately. Actually, the audience has asked me, they said,
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:45.280]   "You don't have enough women on the show." I've put out a call. I said, "Hey, bring it on. If you
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:51.440]   can help me find some guests, I'll do that." I want to talk about your book, Get Her On Board,
[00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:54.720]   in a few minutes and just see what you've learned. Probably what I should have done
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:21:02.800]   was talk to her first to see what you did well and what you didn't. I'm curious, was this part of
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:08.240]   a grand plan? You went off sailing around the world in your late 20s. Was this part of a grand
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:13.040]   plan for adventure or was this more of a, "This sounds fun. Let's do it," type of approach?
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:20.080]   I would say, to be honest, it was a mixture of the two. What got us out the door was a grand plan.
[00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:27.440]   What we realized right away was that doesn't work. Having a grand plan, you're just going to set
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:33.840]   yourself up for disappointment or hurry along too fast or whatever. Initially, it was this big grand
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:38.480]   plan to go sail around the world. We did not sail around the world. We sailed down to Mexico and
[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:46.160]   spent a season down in the Sea of Cortez and then decided we'd take a break. Initially, it was like,
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:49.280]   "Okay, this is what we're going to do. This is year one. Then we're going to be in the South
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:57.440]   Pacific and then New Zealand." We came to realize, "Man, that's too much pressure." Our lifestyle now
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:04.320]   is we just take off and often on a whim without really—we'll know which direction we're going,
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:13.280]   like north or south, but we really find a lot more fun and opportunity when we're just open to who
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:18.800]   we might meet. We're always meeting the most fascinating people. Some of those, by the way,
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:24.720]   have turned into trading opportunities. I've met people who—they're not giving me insider
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:30.480]   information but have given me insights into industries I never would have thought of that
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:38.560]   turned into very profitable trades. We treat the whole thing with much more loosey-goosey attitude
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:46.800]   than we used to. It's kind of a shift. I wonder if it's something due to our U.S. American culture
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:53.120]   or whether it's due to—I don't know what the factor is, but it certainly seems, at least of
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:59.600]   the travel logs that I've read of people who have gone out for extended travel and my own personal
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:05.440]   observation, it seems that we're wired to pursue, at least as U.S. Americans, we're wired to build
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:10.240]   these grand plans and we're all about checking things off the list. Got to go to every country
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:13.040]   in the world, got to visit every continent, got to sail around the world, make a complete
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:19.760]   circle of navigation. We're prone to just checking these things off. You read the lifestyle and it's
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:23.440]   like we're just work, work, work, work, work. Got to go, got to go, got to go, got to go,
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:29.360]   got to get to the next thing. Whereas over time, it seems that travelers, especially if they're
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:34.960]   doing extended travel, seem to mellow a bit and not worry so much about getting to the next country,
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:40.160]   the next state, doing the next thousand miles, but checking the next box, but just simply slowing
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:48.240]   down and enjoying the day a little bit more. I think you're so right. That's the major benefit
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:56.480]   that I see in travel, period, is just taking yourself out of your surroundings and being open
[00:23:56.480 --> 00:24:02.800]   to what's around you and really noticing things. You come back and just everything seems so much
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:08.080]   more rich and you just see things that you never would have seen before. I've noticed the same
[00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:14.720]   thing. I was, I think, a big fan of the travel blogs, but in general, I don't really read them
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:22.560]   much anymore because I do get this feeling like we're just following a script. First, we went
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:29.680]   there and then we went to the next place. They all tend to read somewhat the same with the exception
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:38.480]   of a couple. My co-author, Pat Schulte, he's one of the few travel writers that I read often just
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:46.240]   because I don't get that sense of go, go, go. He's much more taking his time. His photography's
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:53.520]   beautiful. He makes observations about what he's seeing that helps to put me where he is. That's
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:25:00.720]   the sort of travel writing that I like to read. I most definitely don't try and do that myself.
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:08.640]   I've found that when I try and travelogue or write blogs about my travels that I end up
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:13.360]   experiencing less. I'm always thinking about, "Oh, this is a good photo opportunity," or,
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:16.960]   "This is something I could write down." It takes me out of being there in the moment,
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:20.880]   so I don't do that much. I've transitioned in that way myself,
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:29.200]   both from following the guidebook. It's useful to get a guidebook so you can have some general idea
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:34.320]   of what bus line you need to take and where you can find a hotel or a hostel to stay at if you
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:40.960]   need one. I prefer not to go out and see the list of sites in general. I prefer my favorite thing to
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:47.200]   do when I travel and I'm in another country is just simply walk out of the hotel or hostel and
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:53.440]   go and try to get lost and just see what happens. When you get lost, tuck a business card for your
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:58.560]   hostel or hotel in your pocket. If you can't figure out a way to get back, then hail a taxi
[00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:03.760]   and give them the card, and you'll usually wind up back there. It's so exhausting to try to check
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:11.520]   the list of all of the sites and the tours. It's tiring. Interestingly also, I've made a similar
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:17.920]   decision even with things like photography. It's so convenient now to have a beautiful
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:21.920]   cell phone camera in your pocket and take a few snapshots here and there.
[00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:28.560]   I marvel now, and I used to do it. I'm not one to tell other people how they should live their life
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:34.240]   or record their adventures, but I marvel sometimes when you're at a beautiful place, whether it's a
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:41.440]   beautiful natural view and vista or whether it's a famous monument or edifice of some kind.
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:48.800]   If you just stop and look, it's almost as though many of the tourists roll up and they just
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:53.760]   immediately are looking through the camera viewfinder or screen. The entire experience
[00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:58.960]   of the destination is through the camera, making sure that we document that we were here instead
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:08.560]   of soaking it in. I feel a little bit snobby. I feel a little bit like I've become a travel snob,
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:14.000]   and I don't mean to be. It's almost like I just don't understand how I used to do it or why I used
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:19.440]   to do it the way I did it. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know if it's conditioning, or maybe it's
[00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:22.720]   just the initial thrill when you're first traveling. You're just like, "Oh my goodness,
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:25.840]   I can't believe we're doing this. I need to get proof so that everybody can see."
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:36.320]   I'll tell you a couple of stories that maybe confirm what both you and I agree on. We were
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:42.320]   in Costa Rica last year, and we didn't know Costa Rica. I prefer not to read the guidebooks myself,
[00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:50.080]   and I just like to show up and see what happens. We didn't want to roll into San Jose and then just
[00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:56.240]   not know where we were going. You're going to be tired. It's a day-long trip. Anyway, we booked
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:28:02.880]   this place through Airbnb. It's gorgeous, Playa Flamingo. It's on the Nicoya Peninsula. It's
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:10.320]   beautiful, of course. It's gorgeous beaches, and we got a gorgeous place. It was fantastic and all.
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:15.920]   We really like to get to know a place through meeting the people who live there.
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:21.280]   We started talking with a couple who own this absolutely beautiful, I don't want to call it a
[00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:26.720]   resort. It's kind of like a castle perched on a cliff. You can kind of picture it looking out
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:34.640]   across the beach. These guys, they're Americans, husband and wife. We started talking to them, and
[00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:44.000]   they started slamming American politics and politicians and talking about Obamacare and
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:50.240]   all this stuff. We were like, "Gosh, are you guys even here? We don't want to talk about that. We're
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:56.320]   in Costa Rica. Let's hear about that." Then we take off. We had rented this car, and we purposely
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:59.920]   stayed off what they would call their highways. They don't really have highways in Costa Rica,
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:05.760]   but we stayed on the dirt roads, the washboard stuff that takes you 20 miles per hour and five
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:13.520]   hours to go 50 miles sort of thing. Rolled into Samara, I'm not sure how it's pronounced,
[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:19.200]   and didn't have a place to stay. We stop off at the organic grocery, and they're just in line.
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:24.160]   Everybody's getting their orders. They've made orders, and stuff got shipped in, and people are
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:29.600]   picking stuff up. The guy next to me in line, I'm just like, "Hey, how you doing?" I just kind of
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:35.280]   introduced myself. Obviously, I didn't do the tourist thing like, "Where should we go? Where
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:39.280]   are the best sites? Where's the best beach?" I was more like, "Hey, we don't have any place to stay.
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:44.240]   Do you guys know any cool places to stay?" He's like, "Gosh, it's the holidays. Everything's
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:54.320]   booked up, but you guys can stay with us." We take this long road out of town, washboard,
[00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:58.240]   had to cross a couple rivers, which we later found out one was filled with crocodiles.
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:11.280]   We roll up to this gated house. They're Americans, and they're expats, and got their story, but got
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:17.920]   the total inside scoop on what it's like to move down to Costa Rica and keep a place down there.
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:24.320]   We learned so much about the place, the lifestyle, just from these people that were out there doing
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:30.080]   it. They were doing this off-the-grid lifestyle. It never would have happened if we had a place
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:37.680]   that was booked. I can give you a hundred examples of how that serendipity has led to adventures.
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:42.400]   That's the way we like to go now, without much of a plan.
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:46.080]   >> There's a concept. I haven't figured out what to name it. I've never really
[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:51.120]   heard or read anyone else talk about it, but it's just an observation I've made in life.
[00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:58.400]   Again, maybe you and I can come up with a name for it. Basically, I think that if you're willing
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:06.240]   to accept some of the potentially poor outcomes, you get to experience more of the potentially
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:11.840]   amazing outcomes. I see this applied many times in life and travel. If you're willing to do
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:16.800]   something where you're not exactly sure where you're going to stay, but your standards are
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:24.880]   flexible. If worse comes to worse, all the hotels are booked, and I'm staying at some scuzzy,
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:30.960]   flea-bag place with uncomfortable beds, it's okay. I'm going to be okay with it. We'll have
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:38.080]   an adventure. We'll be able to tell something. The reality is, I might actually happen upon
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:43.920]   a beautiful, amazing place to stay that's at a rock-bottom price because it was a last-minute
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:50.480]   deal. I see this applied throughout life. For example, I often think about this with regard to
[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:55.840]   financial planning. One of the biggest challenges as a formal technical financial planner,
[00:31:55.840 --> 00:32:03.280]   especially in a discipline such as retirement planning, is if a client is unwilling to accept
[00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:09.040]   a potential negative outcome, then you have to build a lot of safety into their financial plan.
[00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:13.200]   If they say, "I'm never willing to have my income dip below this amount," well,
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:18.080]   then that's a constraint that gets put onto the financial plan that I've got to account for. As
[00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:23.760]   such, I've got to adjust the portfolio to a more conservative, predictable portfolio.
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:32.080]   On the flip side, if a client were willing to accept a lower amount for a temporary period,
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:38.960]   and they'd be willing or able to restrict their spending for a period of a few years,
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:44.640]   then we can tilt the portfolio in a direction where there's potentially a much higher lifestyle
[00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:50.560]   throughout retirement and much higher residue of the portfolio at death. But the constraint
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:54.640]   that the client places of, "I'm not willing to go below this," just like if you're traveling and you
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:58.880]   say, "I'm never willing to go below a three-star," well, if I'm a tour guide, I'm going to book all
[00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:04.000]   those three-star, four-star hotels in advance. But if you're willing to go with a one-star,
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:09.760]   on the happenstance that we just can't find something else, you might have a five-star
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:16.560]   experience on a two-star price. Yeah. I think you're delving into deep waters here. There's
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:23.040]   so much to talk about with regard to what you just said. I think what I will attack it with
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:31.680]   is this idea of personal responsibility. I don't want to put words into your mouth or make
[00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:36.800]   criticisms about the financial planning industry. I have great respect for it. But I do think that
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:50.320]   one of the functions that a financial planner has is to assuage or help lessen anxiety about money.
[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:57.520]   So your function is to decrease the anxiety through the tools that you have and the knowledge
[00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:06.160]   that you have. Well, they could also do that themselves by learning more about the financial
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:12.560]   markets or doing a better job of managing their own finances. That doesn't mean that your function
[00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:18.560]   is any less valuable. But the same thing happens with trading. The same thing happens with travel,
[00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:26.800]   is that people have perhaps a level of anxiety about these things that could probably be
[00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:34.240]   diminished by learning more or letting go of more. Of saying, "Okay, just like you said,
[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:41.360]   I will forgo the guarantee of three stars for the potential of five stars or one star." And being okay
[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:46.480]   with the fact that either one of those outcomes could happen. I'm going to use my resources and
[00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:54.400]   my knowledge to try and get the five stars as much as possible. But I'm going to take personal
[00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:58.240]   responsibility for it. I think a lot of people aren't willing to take personal responsibility.
[00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:06.640]   Even if they think they are, they make choices to allay their fears rather than diminish risks.
[00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:09.440]   Because fear and risk are completely different things.
[00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:16.640]   Right. You're absolutely correct. And it's certainly, you're absolutely correct.
[00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:21.200]   What's so challenging in how to negotiate these waters with regard to finance,
[00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:26.240]   because there's so many facets of the conversation. And there are so many,
[00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:32.800]   there's such a broad, diverse range of clients and potential clients. And it's difficult as a
[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:39.120]   planner, having been in that position where I am responsible for another person's outcomes.
[00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:46.560]   It's very difficult, I find, for at least me in my personal character and moral code.
[00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:52.080]   It's very difficult to be personally responsible for somebody else's potential negative outcomes.
[00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:52.800]   Totally.
[00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:59.760]   And I remember probably the most pointed example of this was I read the story,
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:05.680]   I read the book called "The Big Short" and part of that profile, I forget the hedge fund trader's
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:10.640]   name. I'm not sure if you remember the guy in California. He was running a private fund and
[00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:16.480]   he has autism and he was running this investment fund. It was a stock fund. And then early in
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:25.360]   the mid 2000s, when he sniffed out the problems in the subprime market, he made just these massive
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:36.480]   bets against subprimes. And he wound up in profiting immensely for his fund. But what happened
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:41.840]   is it actually drove him out of the hedge fund business. He shuttered his hedge fund after the
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:47.120]   fact because he got into a battle with his investors where he knew what he was doing
[00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:52.240]   and he was willing. He didn't know the timing as to when his trade would come to fruition,
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:57.840]   but he had so much of a margin of safety and he'd put everything into this trade. And he had tilted
[00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:06.800]   the portfolio from being a relatively mainstream value stock investment perspective to being
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:12.400]   completely invested in buying insurance contracts. And he'd negotiated all these things. Just a
[00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:19.840]   brilliant move. But his investors were bailing on him when it looked like when he was paying
[00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:25.600]   billions of dollars of interest to keep his trade alive as he waited for it to come out.
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:35.920]   And he actually had put his fund into lockup and he refused to return any funds to his investors
[00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:42.000]   while he was waiting for his trade to come out. His trade came out, but he got out. And my point
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.160]   in telling the story, it's a fascinating story. I highly recommend the book if anyone is interested.
[00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:52.400]   But my point is he couldn't deal with the emotion of having to be accountable to other people for
[00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:56.160]   losing other people. And that's one of the things that I've experienced. I don't think I could ever
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:38:02.000]   manage an investment fund for other people because I may be willing to take the risk with myself. And
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.720]   I may be willing to live on beans and rice and live in a shack while I'm waiting for a trade to
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:11.200]   work out. Or if I screw something up big time, I may be willing to take that downside risk.
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:19.600]   But it would destroy me to see a client have to downsize their home or have to adjust their
[00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:25.680]   lifestyle because of decisions that I made. And there's all these weird psychological issues
[00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:29.280]   surrounding money and the money management business. There's ethical issues, there's
[00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:35.200]   psychological issues. It's just a maelstrom of arguments and debates.
[00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:44.000]   I don't want to say publicity, but this book that Pat and I wrote was pretty well received.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:50.560]   We get good reviews on it. A lot of things have come of it for us. A lot of offers have come.
[00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:58.480]   And one was to start a hedge fund. This fund manager, actually, I can't remember his name,
[00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:05.600]   but he's published actually quite a few papers and he's pretty well respected. But he wanted us to
[00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:13.280]   start a fund. And initially, I was kind of tempted, but then I was like, I can't handle that kind of
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:18.800]   pressure. I can't take responsibility for other people's money. The trades I make, man, I'll take
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:24.240]   flyers a lot, you know, and those sometimes pay off big. Sometimes, well, most of the time they
[00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:29.760]   don't. And that's just the nature of how I trade. But I could never be responsible for somebody
[00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:36.640]   else's money. And frequently, when I'm talking with people about the book or just in casual
[00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:44.480]   conversation, people want a pick. What are you trading? What do you like? What are you in? What
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:52.320]   are you not like? And I just don't even answer those questions anymore. I can't do that. It's
[00:39:52.320 --> 00:40:00.960]   not because I don't feel confident in my own strategies. It's more that I feel like if they
[00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:06.160]   really want to help themselves, they'll learn how to trade for themselves. And our strategies are
[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:14.080]   all about getting to know a core group of stocks, products, services, companies that you use,
[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:22.000]   that you watch, that you understand, and not looking for the hot stock. Don't make small
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:27.120]   trades on things you don't know much about. Make big trades about things you're confident in.
[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:36.640]   That's where you win. So I think the personal responsibility thing is a huge one for me. And I
[00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:41.840]   think that it unlocks a lot of freedom for you in terms of your lifestyle or your entrepreneurial
[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:47.200]   pursuits or your trading or whatever, if you can truly take the good with the bad, if you can take
[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:51.440]   responsibility. And I think there's a lot of value in backing yourself into a corner, fighting your
[00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:57.840]   way out, not having a fallback. I was standing in that grocery line in Costa Rica. I didn't have
[00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:05.440]   any fallback. I didn't have a place to go. The entire town was booked. So it was like, I got to
[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:10.400]   talk to this guy. I mean, I enjoy meeting new people. So that's a benny. But you know what?
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:13.840]   There was no other choice. I had to ask this guy next to me where I could stay.
[00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:24.080]   And it worked out fabulously. Are you aware of anything different in your background that has
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:29.600]   led you to be able to take that kind of approach that you do? Because that's not I don't know.
[00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:35.840]   I don't know what the what the percentages would be, but that's not a mainstream approach. You are
[00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:42.000]   more comfortable with risk than many people. Was it growing up and on an off the grid hippie back
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:47.760]   to the land movement environment or maybe was there something about your background that you've
[00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:53.360]   identified that has led you to be more comfortable with risk? I don't know. I mean, I guess I could
[00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:59.840]   go on and on and on and bore people to tears. But I think maybe partially, yeah, what you're saying.
[00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:06.400]   I mean, we moved to Portland, Oregon. My family did in the early 80s. And my we didn't have any
[00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:12.000]   money. I mean, we had to be really poor, like as in our church was giving us a box of food. So I
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:18.320]   know what it's like to be really poor. Well, maybe not really poor, they're much less fortunate people
[00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:24.320]   than we were really poor in the US American context. Yeah, yeah. I know what it's like to
[00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:28.320]   have holes in my jeans, you know, and have kids make fun of me because of it and that sort of
[00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:36.640]   thing. So maybe that's partially it. I think also I've throughout my professional career, you know,
[00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:42.640]   I'm not a particularly super duper outgoing person. But, you know, I started teaching in grad
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:51.920]   school and my first day teaching in front of 250 kids, college students, my fly was unzipped.
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:43:01.680]   You know, it was incredibly embarrassing, but I, you know, I, I made some sort of joke. I remember
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:06.400]   what I said and, you know, and they erupted with laughter and I zipped it up and it kept going.
[00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:12.880]   And, you know, I, as a not super outgoing person, I worked on television for years and years and
[00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:18.960]   years. And I've just seen over and over again, how much your psychology is moldable. I mean,
[00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:26.480]   your emotions are completely your decision. You can, you can change your outlook on the flip of a
[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:35.040]   switch, you know, and who you think you are, the shy person or the non risk taker. That's completely
[00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:39.360]   in your head. I mean, just take a small risk, talk to the person in the grocery line next to you,
[00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:47.120]   you know, smile at a stranger, just the little itty bitty things, you know, build up to taking
[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:53.440]   much bigger risks. You'll have a lot more confidence. So I don't know. I wouldn't say
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:58.880]   I'm the biggest risk taker in the world. I, as I've gotten older, I'm 41 now, I'd say that I've
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:06.640]   become more conservative over time financially in terms of my business decisions. But still,
[00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:12.720]   I'm astounded how people paint themselves into a little box, define themselves, and then they don't,
[00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:16.720]   they don't leave the prison of their own making. It's especially sad when they're unhappy about it.
[00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:22.160]   You know, they're unhappy with the life they've chosen. But it's, you know, it's all in your head.
[00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:29.280]   Right. Yeah, I'm interested in just personal development and have been for many years. And
[00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:34.720]   I've experienced two things, like two of those types of experiences. I'm, personally, I'm an
[00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:42.720]   introvert and by nature. And yet I learned in high school that I would, that it didn't seem like the
[00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:47.120]   introverts were getting the results that other people did. So I learned to pretend to be an
[00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:51.680]   extrovert until I became comfortable with it. And to this day, I'm more comfortable alone.
[00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:56.640]   But I can, you know, I've learned to turn it on. And it's powerful once you realize that you can
[00:44:56.640 --> 00:45:01.600]   change something about yourself. And then I think one of the most transformative experiences when I
[00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:07.760]   went into sales as a financial advisor, then, you know, I was, I had read people and said,
[00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:13.520]   if you learn to be an effective salesperson, that'll go with you for the rest of your life.
[00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:19.680]   And learning to, learning to deal with rejection, learning to deal with the challenges and learning
[00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:25.120]   to deal with people saying no to you and learning to build tenacity and dogged persistence,
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:29.520]   which are required for success, especially success in financial services,
[00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:35.440]   was one of the most valuable, transformative experiences I've ever been through. And it's,
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:41.040]   it seems like all the good stuff is after the tough stuff. And the most important thing is
[00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:45.520]   that you are able to become a different person through challenging processes.
[00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:50.400]   Well, yeah, I mean, I'm not even sure you become a different person, but it's just,
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:54.160]   you know, the way that you operate in your life, you see a lot less limits. I mean,
[00:45:54.160 --> 00:46:00.000]   going back to fear and risk, you know, as a salesperson, you know, what's the bigger risk,
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.200]   making the sales call or not making the sales call?
[00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:04.160]   Right.
[00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:04.480]   You know,
[00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:04.960]   Not making.
[00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:12.560]   Yeah, that's the bigger risk by far. I mean, businesses are made or broken on sales. And,
[00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:19.680]   you know, if you get so entwined with fear, you're going to, you know, you're going to
[00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:24.240]   take risks that you shouldn't take. Yeah, you know, I've become more interested in,
[00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:31.120]   in personal development in the last few years. When we sat down and wrote this book, Pat and
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:34.880]   I have been friends for a long time, and we basically just wanted to do a project together.
[00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:40.160]   And the question we asked ourselves was, what can we do? How can we help people go out and
[00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:45.360]   have adventures? What's the excuse that they give, you know, for why they can't go do what
[00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:48.640]   they really want to do? And we saw this money, you know, people think they don't have enough
[00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:53.200]   money. Well, we wrote a book about not only how to change your lifestyle to get you ready to go
[00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:58.640]   have that adventure, but to make money while you're having the adventure. But what I'm coming
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:03.280]   to realize, you know, after the fact, we wrote this book, what, two years ago, three years ago,
[00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:10.960]   something like that. You know, the, the psychology of change is maybe even more important than this
[00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:16.960]   question of dollars. What, what is it about people and the way that they think? Why are some people
[00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:21.200]   successful? Why are some people not successful? I'm not sure it comes down to whether you're
[00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:26.720]   outgoing or not, or would you say introverted or extroverted? I don't think it comes down to that.
[00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:34.240]   I think, I think it's much more complex. If, if you'll indulge some, some theorizing,
[00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:40.480]   this is not founded on anybody else's philosophy or anything, but I think that there are really
[00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:49.040]   three people that, that live within us, three personas. The first is, I think what I'll call
[00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:56.480]   like an effigy. It's like what we think we should be, and that can be influenced by culture,
[00:47:56.480 --> 00:48:02.240]   by our upbringing, by school, by parents. Of course, as we see on TV, there's this effigy,
[00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:06.720]   there's this standard that we hold ourselves to somewhere. There's this thing we think we should
[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:15.200]   be. Then there's the person or persona that we think we are. We think that we're introverted
[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:23.280]   or extroverted, rich or poor, smart, dumb. I don't know, choose your adjective. And then
[00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:30.000]   the third thing is who we really are. The third persona is who we really are. This is what we
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:36.640]   know to be true. And I think that people don't spend enough time getting to know who they really
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:45.280]   are, where their strengths really are, where their power comes from. And I think that the more time
[00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:53.280]   you can spend ruminating and deciding that you are an incredibly capable, powerful person,
[00:48:53.280 --> 00:49:00.720]   the more able you're going to be to take risks, to take responsibility, know that you can fight
[00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:07.600]   your way out of situations, and ultimately, the more successful you'll be. So don't spend so much
[00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:14.320]   time measuring up against other people, bloggers who travel around the world, or traders who say
[00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:22.640]   that they're making tens of thousands of dollars per day, or people who have washboard abs. Think
[00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:29.360]   more about what's inside. And I think that forms a foundation for success. It just does, because
[00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:35.040]   you'll go off and you'll have the confidence to know that your real self can't be bruised,
[00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:40.640]   can't be hurt by not finding that three-star hotel tonight. You know what I mean?
[00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:47.440]   Right. It takes time to learn that. I feel I'm almost 30, but I feel like I'm only just a child.
[00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:55.760]   The older I get, the more I feel of how little I know and how little I've experienced and how
[00:49:55.760 --> 00:50:02.720]   much I have yet to learn. And I'm thankful to be learning. But I guess maybe it was naive,
[00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:07.360]   but I always thought that as I got older, I would feel more and more confident. And what I knew
[00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:11.520]   I find is, I get older, I feel less and less confident in what I know.
[00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:18.640]   Can I tell you a little story about you? So I initially found out about you and your podcast
[00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:24.800]   from your interview with Pat Schulte, my co-author on the book. And of course, I thought to myself,
[00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:29.760]   "This is an earnest guy. This is a guy who is putting himself out there and doing something
[00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:35.120]   that I'm actually interested in doing, which is podcasting." And I listened to a few of the
[00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:40.720]   episodes. And I'm actually fairly busy, so I don't listen to podcasts all the time. And I got
[00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:52.880]   behind on your episodes. And it invited me to come on generously, and I had not scheduled anything.
[00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:57.040]   And I listened to a couple of your podcasts. And one, I can't remember which episode it was,
[00:50:57.040 --> 00:51:03.760]   but one in which you went to some sort of conference and you stayed in your car. You
[00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:11.840]   lived out of your car. And that touched a chord with me, because I think that people
[00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:16.880]   focus so much on this endgame, this result, this trip around the world,
[00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:22.000]   they don't pay attention to what they're willing to suffer for, what they're willing to put
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:28.800]   themselves through in order to learn something really true and genuine. Because you can read
[00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:35.440]   things in books. You can listen to podcasts and hear enlightening things or trading secrets or
[00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:40.240]   whatever. But learning about yourself is putting yourself in uncomfortable situations. And you
[00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:47.600]   stayed in your car. That's radical personal finance right there. That's going further than
[00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:52.800]   somebody else normally would. And hearing your thoughts on what you learned from doing that,
[00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:59.200]   I thought was really cool. And I think that resonated with me when I first decided I wanted
[00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:07.280]   to go sailing. Man, my financial world was so... I mean, I didn't know one thing from another.
[00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:12.160]   This is even when I started trading. I thought when I bought a boat, I could get a loan for
[00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:19.200]   100 grand and pay off $1,000 a month, and it would be paid off in 100 months. That's how sad it was.
[00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:28.080]   But I decided to minimize costs wherever I could, because I wanted to dedicate myself to this dream
[00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:33.840]   of sailing away. And so I started riding my bike. And I was doing morning weather at the time in San
[00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:43.280]   Francisco. So morning weather man gets to work at 3 a.m. So to ride my bicycle, even when I had the
[00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:52.640]   car that was paid off, just to save that extra $10 in gas money and to go out and freeze my tail off
[00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:59.360]   to do it, that was me proving to myself my dedication to a philosophy. And that philosophy
[00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:09.680]   was low economic impact. It was being green, not burning fossil fuels. I was committing myself to
[00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:15.840]   values that were as much a part of the sailing dream as actually hoisting those sails and taking
[00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:24.320]   off. And so when I heard that you had decided to, we'll just use the word, suffer or sacrifice in
[00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:29.760]   the name of something that truly is radical personal finance, i.e. living in a car instead
[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:36.560]   of paying for a hotel, that really struck a chord with me. I appreciate that. It was hard for me to
[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:45.200]   decide to talk about things like that on the show, because the way that it seems that everybody in
[00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:55.360]   our society operates is very much about, and I like your three people illustration, because what
[00:53:55.360 --> 00:54:00.000]   happens is most people we try to project the number two, the persona that we think we are,
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:05.840]   that we think that society wants us to be. Maybe a combination of the effigy and the persona.
[00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:12.640]   So in things like business or in things like finance especially, especially money,
[00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:18.640]   if you're not a guru, if you're not saying, "Look, I've got this all figured out. Here,
[00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:23.280]   I've made these millions. Let me tell you how to do it." It's almost like, "Well, what do I have
[00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:29.120]   to offer?" But I realized in time, when I was a financial advisor, I was committed to being
[00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:36.160]   frugal. I've been committed to trying to build my wealth. And so for the first few years of being
[00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:42.480]   actually a practicing financial advisor, I was driving the car that I had bought in college,
[00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:50.480]   a 1993 Honda Accord, and I sold it with over 300,000 miles on it. And the car was worth $2,000,
[00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:56.320]   and here I would be pulling up in people's driveways with my $2,000 car to go in and tell
[00:54:56.320 --> 00:55:02.560]   them what to do with their money. And people are asking about it. I said, "Listen, I know the
[00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:07.920]   financial situation of some other financial advisors, and I'm so sick and tired of the guy
[00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:13.600]   that walks in with an $800 a month BMW lease payment, and he can't even afford that, doesn't
[00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:18.080]   have a dime, but he's gonna tell you how to be rich. Don't you see through this? Don't you see
[00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:23.680]   that my entire industry is... It seems like the majority of the people in my industry are lying
[00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:28.400]   to you on a daily basis, and it's all about perception, trying to affect your perception
[00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:34.000]   bias. Wouldn't you rather work with somebody who actually does have some money versus somebody who
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:38.320]   looks like they have some money? And wouldn't you like it if someone were authentic?" And it took me,
[00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:43.840]   however, years to become comfortable... It's easy now for me to do that, to become comfortable with
[00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:54.000]   that. But it took a lot for me to be to the point where I wasn't ashamed. I wasn't ashamed to park
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:59.680]   my car around the side. And I feel as though that's one of the beautiful things about the
[00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:04.320]   internet is that it allows us... Or just about communications, it allows us to kind of pull some
[00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:12.160]   of those walls down. And what I realized that I appreciate is when people are transparent and
[00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:18.640]   authentic, because I spent a lot of time listening to people who were so-called gurus, and I always
[00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:23.040]   felt there was something wrong with me 'cause I couldn't do what they did. My to-do list is never
[00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:28.480]   done. My email inbox gets to zero messages about once every two months. I'm not perfect.
[00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:35.280]   I've made a lot of mistakes. Even starting this business, I was a dumb-dumb and I thought I needed
[00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:39.120]   to put all my money in retirement accounts. And then when I wanted to start a business and I bought
[00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:44.000]   an expensive house, then I didn't have as much money as I needed available 'cause I have it all
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:49.360]   in home equity and retirement accounts, which doesn't help me today. And so, I realized that
[00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:57.280]   if we can just deal with not having to stroke our ego... And for me, that was... Maybe for some people
[00:56:57.280 --> 00:57:06.000]   they can summon up the personal will of... Maybe some people can just do it on their own, but for
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:12.560]   me it was a real spiritual transformation in my life where I became a little bit more conscious
[00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:18.480]   of who I was on a spiritual level and realized that I didn't need to try to tell... I didn't
[00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:23.440]   need to try to portray anything. All I needed to do was simply be me and that's okay. It sounds
[00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:31.200]   like a self-help show here. But there are so many people that are trapped in ways of saying...
[00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:36.880]   Trapped in ways of living. And I think when you get to the point where you say, "No matter what
[00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:42.400]   I'm gonna do this," like with radical personal finance, I can't tell someone how necessarily
[00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:46.160]   to be a millionaire except for the academic theory. I'm not a millionaire yet. But I can
[00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:55.280]   teach how to apply financial planning concepts. I can't teach trading like you do. I'm not an
[00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:59.760]   effective trader. I don't have any knowledge so I purposefully avoid talking about that
[00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:06.240]   except from the academic side and send people off to learn their own. But what I can do is I can
[00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:12.080]   show a path to entrepreneurship because I came to the conclusion that if I need to rent out my house
[00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:17.360]   and I'm not planning on it, but if I need to cash out my IRA, I would rather do that
[00:58:18.080 --> 00:58:26.560]   and not waste a decade of my life hoping that someday I can fix this need. I'm tired of waiting
[00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:34.080]   and I feel like so much of my life I lived it under the impression that... Under that effigy,
[00:58:34.080 --> 00:58:38.640]   what we think we should be, the path that I think you should take. And I realized that,
[00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:44.160]   "You know what? That's simply not the case. There's only one person that I'm responsible to
[00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:49.920]   and that's God. And beyond that, I don't have to keep other people happy by following society's
[00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:58.480]   plan." And I know it is super self-introspective or whatever, but it's a reality that I think...
[00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:06.000]   Maybe it's a transforming into an adult and maybe I wasn't before, but you realize I had a
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:10.480]   conversation with my wife and with this I'll stop talking. And I've had conversations with some of
[00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:16.800]   my friends that society has laid out this script for you. And essentially the script is, "Go to high
[00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:20.160]   school, make sure you graduate from high school so that you can go to college. Go to college,
[00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:24.640]   make sure you graduate from college. In order to be successful, you need to have a job, you need to
[00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:29.680]   buy a house, you need to get married, you need to get a dog and you need to get a kid."
[00:59:29.680 --> 00:59:36.400]   And I've done all those things, not necessarily because society said so, but I've done all those
[00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:41.200]   things. And I always had operating in the back because I was always the responsible one. So,
[00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:45.760]   I always had that script running in the back of my head that I need to be responsible. People like me
[00:59:45.760 --> 00:59:50.320]   don't drop out of college. People like me don't get bad grades. People like me don't do this stuff.
[00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:55.920]   And you finally wake up and you say, "You know what? I like the house I live in. I love my wife.
[00:59:55.920 --> 01:00:01.840]   I'm thrilled with my kids. I love my dogs." But the reality is that stuff, at this point,
[01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:07.440]   I could give it all up and I could walk away without a college degree. Forget the high school
[01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:12.800]   diploma. Get rid of the house. Get rid of the car. Get rid of the job. Get rid of those things. Don't
[01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:18.960]   even matter to me. There's something different. And maybe it's just realizing that there's more
[01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:25.520]   than just checking the boxes. And I see that real passion with my generation. And people write about
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:32.320]   it. They write about the millennials. They talk about it. But it really is... I'm not sure where
[01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:36.400]   I'm going, so I'll shut up. But I appreciate the kind comments. It's been a growth process for me.
[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:50.720]   Well, I think it comes to, for a word, for me, the word is earnestness. It's an honest, genuine
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:57.520]   pursuit. And I think it's a lifelong process. I think your 30s are a really important time where
[01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:03.280]   you do become centered. You do give up trying to impress... well, not everybody, but some people
[01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:09.120]   give up trying to impress others quite as much. And you get to know yourself a little bit more.
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:15.440]   So yeah, I think that's one of the benefits of aging. I mean, you get the aches and the pains.
[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:20.800]   Those only get worse. But you do get to know yourself quite a bit more. I think that's what
[01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:26.480]   you're describing. And the more you do that introspection, the more you come to realize that
[01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:32.720]   there isn't a dollar figure. There isn't a particular job title. There isn't a particular
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:37.760]   situation even. There isn't a particular country to visit that will lead to the type of fulfillment
[01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:44.240]   that you're talking about. It's definitely an inner journey. And to bring it back to something
[01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:50.640]   else you said about authenticity and being honest, I'll tell you as a business person,
[01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:56.080]   I work with very large companies and I work with entrepreneurs.
[01:01:56.080 --> 01:02:06.000]   I will tell you that authenticity and honesty are in such low supply,
[01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:15.360]   often, that when you come across people who are authentic, who are honest, and you know what
[01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:21.280]   they're saying to be, not just a snow job, you hang on to those people. You do business with them.
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:25.280]   You go back to them. You pay more for their services than you would from somebody else.
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:33.440]   You have loyalty to those people. Being an honest person about whether your company is
[01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:41.040]   actually thriving or whether it's in turmoil, being honest with other business partners about
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:49.680]   your fears, I think that that will put you ahead in the long run. And if people that you're working
[01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:54.880]   with disrespect you because of that honesty, those aren't the types of people that you want
[01:02:54.880 --> 01:03:01.040]   to do business with. The business people that I've had experience with who are extremely successful
[01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:06.720]   have a talent for seeing the world as it really is. I don't know whether that's seeing themselves
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:10.480]   as they really are, but seeing the world as it really is, identifying opportunities that
[01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:17.680]   really are there that aren't just hyped up by some blog or some technical article or something
[01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:22.000]   like that. They see opportunities that are really there. Having that ability to cut through the,
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:27.840]   well, you don't have to use your bleeper, but the BS, having the ability to cut through that BS
[01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:35.040]   is what sets the top CEOs from the guys who end up pushing paper in some mid-levels.
[01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:39.600]   So I think the more that we can be honest with ourselves, the more that we can be honest with
[01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:46.080]   our business partners and I guess this online community that continues to develop these
[01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:53.840]   podcast communities, you can see the people who are thriving in these emerging arenas.
[01:03:53.840 --> 01:04:01.200]   And a lot of them have this ability to be honest, to be forthright. So I think that's
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:06.480]   really important. It comes back to responsibility. It comes back to being honest. It comes back to
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:11.680]   being transparent. So yeah, I think there's a lot of power in that. And I don't know if
[01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:17.920]   it's too much self-help woo-woo for one podcast or what, but that's definitely how I operate.
[01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:23.840]   When I'm doing business, I definitely hang on to those people who I feel are honest.
[01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:29.760]   I appreciate the encouragement. It is encouraging. I'd like to explore,
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:36.960]   and hopefully it's not too much self-help stuff, but that's the stuff that matters. It really does.
[01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:42.160]   I mean, if you really, really do want to change your situation, if you really,
[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:46.400]   really do want to change your life, this is the stuff that matters, guys. It's not that trade,
[01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:51.120]   that single trade or that trip to Bali. That's not it. You're going to be the same person when
[01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:56.160]   you get there. I guarantee it. And even with business, even with trading,
[01:04:56.160 --> 01:05:01.920]   one of the things I did observe, which finally gave me the courage to say, "Forget it. I can
[01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:10.480]   figure it out as I go," is I recognize that I have a tendency to judge. I personally probably
[01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:14.080]   think that some things are not recoverable, but when you actually study the research,
[01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:20.640]   I can't remember the statistics on the top of my head, but a majority of millionaires have been
[01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:27.760]   bankrupt or close to bankrupt on more than one occasion. And you realize that it's a mental
[01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:35.360]   construct. It's a mental fabrication. And the idea, and I'm very much a planner. That's why
[01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:38.960]   I'm a financial planner. And so I think, "Well, I have to have it all figured out." And I realize,
[01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:44.640]   I don't. I can enjoy the journey. And I'll tell you, I love it. I am enjoying the journey that
[01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:51.680]   I'm doing, even though I'm working like a crazy man and I do these wacky ways of taking trips,
[01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:58.720]   like I did, and being able to save the money. I had savings. I could have spent the money,
[01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:04.160]   but it was part of test on the hotel rooms. But I just thought, "What a waste of money,"
[01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:11.040]   first of all. And it was part of me testing it. You know, am I willing? You can indeed,
[01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:18.240]   you don't have to have it all. I could indeed be happy and be in dire straits.
[01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:26.560]   Well, I think it comes down to, I don't want to get too deep or philosophical because I'm not.
[01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:30.000]   We've already gone to this point, so feel free. Go ahead.
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:36.480]   I think there's a part of us that are somewhat masochistic. I think that we do like to suffer
[01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:42.080]   for the things that we love or the things that we value. I think we're willing to suffer for
[01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:53.200]   the things, the people, the pursuits that we adore. And I think part of that is testing ourselves,
[01:06:53.840 --> 01:07:00.800]   seeing how far we can go. I ran a marathon this fall. I'm not a naturally gifted runner. I'm
[01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:09.840]   top heavy, and I'm just a big person. I'm not a good runner. But I wanted to see if I could do it.
[01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:15.280]   I wanted to try something that I thought was a good chance I could fail at, because I wanted
[01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:21.920]   to see how far I could go. It's that whole, who's quote, is it T.S. Eliot? You don't know.
[01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:26.800]   Only those who try to go too far know how far they can go or something like that.
[01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:33.920]   I think we have to know what we're willing to suffer for. I'm willing to suffer for things
[01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:41.120]   that teach me about myself. I don't know if that's masochism, but I feel like I learn new
[01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:47.520]   things about myself, and I'm able to push even further. That's what I'd like to tell people who
[01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:54.800]   have the passion to travel but don't feel like they can. Take that first step. Book an uncomfortable
[01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:59.520]   hotel room or sleep in your car. You don't have to go travel around the world. Go sleep in your car.
[01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:04.560]   Test those assumptions about whether or not you really will be so embarrassed because you're
[01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:11.120]   sleeping in your car and everybody else is in a four-star hotel. Test yourself. Test your assumptions.
[01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:18.320]   Figure out what you're willing to suffer for. Right. Absolutely. The reason is, even just when
[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:25.040]   you curtail your spending, I always think about how far a dollar can go in other parts of the
[01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:30.560]   world. I say, "I'd rather not spend the 20 here because that 20 bucks on this expenditure at home,
[01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:39.840]   $30 thoughtlessly spent on a meal out because I was too lazy to plan ahead to have food available
[01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:45.840]   at home, that $30 can take me an extra day on the road. I'd rather be an extra day on the road
[01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:50.080]   than just have this trip down to TGI Fridays because we were too lazy to plan ahead."
[01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:54.640]   It's so funny. My wife and I were at the grocery store the other day,
[01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:56.560]   Whole Foods. Do you guys have Whole Foods out there?
[01:08:56.560 --> 01:09:08.880]   Yes. I'm in hippie, crunchy, affluent people who shop it. Within a mile of my house, I've got
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:13.280]   Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, and two local gourmet markets that are all-
[01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:14.240]   Yuppieville.
[01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:15.840]   Exactly. I'm in Yuppieville where I live.
[01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:23.040]   Yeah. We're in Food Nation here in Portland, Oregon. My wife and I are at Whole Foods. We
[01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:31.600]   want to get some fish. We're all up to the counter. Halibut is like, I love halibut. I love
[01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:38.080]   fish in general, but halibut's 30 bucks a pound. I'm like, "Holy smokes, 30 bucks a pound is going
[01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:48.880]   to cost us 50 bucks to get a good dinner." You forgo that expensive fish, but you're really
[01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:52.400]   willing to go out to the sushi restaurant and drop 70. You know what I mean?
[01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:52.800]   Right.
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:59.840]   It's like you could go have a fabulous, fabulous halibut steak dinner for less money than you're
[01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:08.000]   going to spend at a restaurant. I catch myself in those quandaries all the time. To drop
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:14.320]   back into living on the margin and traveling and spending less and financial independence,
[01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:21.280]   people are, I think, frequently amazed at how far a dollar will go outside of the U.S.
[01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:28.080]   Shopping at Whole Foods, Whole Paycheck, it's silly. It's a $100 bag of groceries, and you could
[01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:41.840]   live for a week or more eating out all the time in Mexico or Indonesia. It's incredible how much
[01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:44.960]   we waste just because of inattention.
[01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:53.120]   Absolutely is. I'd like to explore three topics, and we can hit these either quick hits or we can
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:58.160]   dive into them. We're not necessarily on a time limit, but there are three things that I've
[01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:04.800]   mentioned that are more connected to personal finance. I'm going to start with the concept of
[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:08.880]   distributed retirement and the advantages and disadvantages of that. I want to talk a little
[01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:15.200]   bit about timing the market and then finish up with your ideas and thoughts. I know you've written
[01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:19.680]   the book, which I highly recommend, Live on the Margin, about it, but essentially how to learn
[01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:25.280]   trading in today's context. Let's start with distributed retirement. This is, or at least,
[01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:31.040]   the idea of don't wait until you're rich and can retire at 65, but be willing when you're 28 or
[01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:38.000]   38 or whatever to take a year or three months, as the case may be, and go, even though you don't
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:42.400]   have enough money for the rest of your life to be financially independent. One of the big fears that
[01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:48.240]   people have is that if they do that, they'll be set back. They'll be set back in their career.
[01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:57.600]   They'll go backwards. Has your experience with your life so far with doing this, going, taking
[01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:02.160]   a trip, doing that, would you say it's been a net positive on your overall career and financial
[01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:05.440]   prospects, neutral or negative? Negative.
[01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:15.840]   Expand. How do you mean? Well, I mean, I made quite a bit of money doing television. If I
[01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:23.600]   dedicated myself to full-time trading, I would make quite a bit more money. I don't think we've
[01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:33.280]   talked about it, but my company, I do industrial voiceover. It's not glamorous, but it pays the
[01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:40.240]   bills. It's not necessarily convenient for my clients for me to disappear for two or three
[01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:52.800]   months. So I lose income from taking trips. So strictly from a financial perspective, I would
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:13:02.480]   have more in the bank if I spent more time just generating cash. So that's not even disputable.
[01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:07.680]   If I wanted to go back to television, I'd probably have to start off in a smaller market than I left.
[01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:12.720]   I left the fifth largest market and probably, I don't know, I'd probably be in South Bend,
[01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:20.720]   Indiana or I don't know, Charlotte or something like that. So there's no doubt that I would be
[01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:27.840]   further "ahead" if I dedicated all my time to making money. But those are not my priorities.
[01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:34.640]   I'm not putting all my eggs in one basket for something that may or may not happen, which is
[01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:43.360]   retirement at 65 or 58 and a half or whatever you want. Do you second guess yourself sometimes?
[01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:51.280]   To be perfectly honest, yes. It's hard not to. Even if you are traveling, you're still
[01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:58.160]   inundated with imagery and stories from other people who are either financially ahead of you
[01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:07.120]   or on par with you. It's hard not to be drawn towards that effigy we were talking about,
[01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:12.960]   this ideal of who you think you could be. But I would say that I am not consumed with it.
[01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:20.000]   The type of traveling lifestyle that we lead is traveling part of the year and so I'm never all
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:24.800]   the way off the grid. Do you know what I mean? So I never feel completely disconnected. And also,
[01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:31.920]   financially, we're in very good shape. Part of that has to do with the fact that we don't have
[01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:38.560]   children. Children are very expensive. Let's switch to timing the market.
[01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:49.120]   There's this major debate in finance circles around timing the market. And essentially people
[01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:54.400]   argue you can, you can't. The academic research, much of what's done will say, "Well, you can't
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:58.640]   predict in advance who's going to be able to time the market." So it's academically unsound.
[01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:03.440]   And yet there are many people who say, "You're a fool if you think you can't time the market. Look,
[01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:09.920]   I have. Look at these certain things." Have you developed a way to integrate, and maybe those are
[01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:15.680]   straw men, maybe they're real, but have you developed a philosophy that integrates the
[01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:23.120]   realities on either side of that issue? Well, first of all, let me preface this by
[01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:28.880]   saying that trying to time the market as a casual investor or somebody who works full-time at
[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:37.040]   something else is pure folly. If you don't have the time to pay attention, you're going to be at
[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:43.600]   the emotional whims of the media. I pulled up CNN this morning, and one of the stories was like,
[01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:52.000]   "The world's economy is in worse condition than we thought." You're going to try and make decisions
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:59.040]   based on limited information. If you're a much more involved investor, somebody who's selective
[01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:03.840]   about the securities that they buy, I think that there's -- well, the investments that you make,
[01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:12.800]   not just securities -- I think that you absolutely can time the market. I brought up the example of
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:23.040]   the house that we sold in Colorado before the subprime crisis hit. I could see that it was
[01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:28.480]   already starting to happen in some of the fastest-growing markets. In Florida, it had
[01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:40.560]   already become a disaster by, let's say, late 2007. By mid-2008, before anybody really understood
[01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:49.120]   what credit default swaps were, I could see that the economic engine that had been producing most
[01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:55.120]   of the income for households, which was the appreciation of their primary residents, was
[01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:59.840]   about to fall flat on its face. I didn't need to know all the mechanics ahead of time. I could see
[01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:04.880]   that it was happening. It was happening in some markets first. There was no doubt in my mind I
[01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:12.640]   needed a rapid exit. Did I time the market perfectly? No, I didn't. I didn't get back in
[01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:20.080]   in 2009 until after I had sold my company. I was late in the recovery. I missed out on some of that.
[01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:28.960]   But I did get in when the news was still really bad. I think a lot of this has to do with just
[01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:38.000]   paying attention to what's happening. A lot of my greatest investments have come from people that
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:43.600]   I've met in industries I haven't previously thought about or understood, but had told me
[01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:47.600]   things about what they were doing in their businesses that led me to believe that I could
[01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:52.000]   make a move. This is not insider information at all. This is just them talking about what's going
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:58.800]   on in their business. I sat next to a guy on a plane to San Diego. I was going down to visit
[01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:10.480]   Boat. He worked for a very well-known cloud computing software security company. "Hey,
[01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:13.920]   what are you doing? What are you going down here for?" He says, "Oh, we're having an all-hands
[01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:21.200]   meeting with the lead of our sales team." "Oh, really? What's going on?" He says, "Oh,
[01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:26.320]   it's just been a brutal quarter." "Oh, really? Okay. What's going on?" "Just, you know,
[01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:33.120]   companies aren't investing the way they should. There's new players on the field. Competition's
[01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:38.320]   steep." So I went back and I looked at this company, and I actually looked at their technical,
[01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:43.440]   their fundamental numbers. "Oh, okay. There hasn't been much movement here.
[01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:49.120]   Earnings, two weeks away. What's going on? News looks pretty good."
[01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:57.040]   Earnings came out. It was horrendous. It was terrible. I had bought puts way out of the money.
[01:18:57.040 --> 01:19:03.920]   I don't know if we talked much about options trading, but I basically shorted this company,
[01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:11.520]   this issue. It was one of my best trades of the year. It just happened to be something that I
[01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:18.160]   wasn't necessarily watching. It's not like I had some sort of insider trading information.
[01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:23.200]   It's just asking somebody about how their business was doing, asking why.
[01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:32.160]   Asking why is a huge, huge tool for figuring out whether or not you can time something.
[01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:44.400]   So when there isn't enough information, don't make a trade. Don't make a move. But when there
[01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:52.160]   is information that piques your interest, ask why. Ask if it's reasonable. Ask if you can lead
[01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:57.040]   the pack. Get ahead of the game. Don't invest in the hot thing. Invest in the thing that's not so
[01:19:57.040 --> 01:20:00.560]   hot. Or when it's super hot, you think there might be a reason why it's going to crash,
[01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:06.480]   really delve into that. Figure out if there's some evidence for what you think may be happening.
[01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:10.720]   So I don't know if that really answers your timing the market question. Can you always
[01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:17.200]   time the market? No. But you can certainly time it here and there. I can bring up another example
[01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:25.280]   from real estate. In the book, we actually talked about how you probably shouldn't invest in real
[01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:32.240]   estate. Returns aren't high enough. We wrote this in 2011, 2012. I didn't see much movement in
[01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:39.120]   prices. But by the time we were publishing, we were living in Del Mar, California. I was looking
[01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:44.400]   around. Gosh, interest rates sure are low. And there's nothing on the market. There's nothing
[01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:50.720]   to buy down here. The inventory is really, really low. I started looking around San Diego in general.
[01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:57.840]   Not much inventory. Interest rates super low. Why isn't there much movement? And I thought,
[01:20:57.840 --> 01:21:03.920]   well, it's because banks haven't eased their guidelines yet. You can't get a mortgage without
[01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:10.240]   your 20% down. Lending standards have, for good reason, gotten very, very tight.
[01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:18.720]   So when I looked at what part of the real estate market might grow fastest, so I'd become certain
[01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:25.040]   that we were going to see a recovery in housing. I looked at what sectors might be fastest to
[01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:31.600]   recover and appreciate the most. I initially thought, well, we'll go low end. We'll buy
[01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:35.200]   something on the lower end of the market, something cheap. Well, lending standards
[01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:38.160]   aren't easing that much. I think they're going to stay pretty tight for a while.
[01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:46.800]   So I thought, what are the fastest appreciating markets? Portland, Oregon was already appreciating
[01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:50.800]   fastest on the West Coast, aside from San Francisco, which I didn't want to get into.
[01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:56.960]   Let's look for something that's not at the low end of the market in Portland. There's a lot of
[01:21:56.960 --> 01:22:04.400]   press, a lot of buzz about Portland. This is two years ago. Bought something at the high end of
[01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:10.400]   a middle class neighborhood. Found a good opportunity where the people who move to this
[01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:15.920]   neighborhood don't necessarily have super tight finances. They can move into a $600,000, $700,000,
[01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:23.520]   $800,000 house without a bust to the bank. So we bought an ugly duckling and have seen,
[01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:29.120]   if you look at just the return on our down, if we cashed out today, very conservative numbers,
[01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:38.320]   an annualized return of about 45%, 50%. So is that time in the market? I think it is.
[01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:46.400]   Will I call this a home and stay here forever? Probably not. And I don't want to prognosticate,
[01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:50.240]   but I won't be in real estate forever, I'll tell you that.
[01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:59.760]   I could do hour and two hour shows on this. And maybe it's on my list of things, maybe I'll
[01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:06.080]   explore more. But for me, there were some major breakthroughs for me on the timing the market
[01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:10.720]   question when I understood that there were multiple versions of the efficient market hypothesis.
[01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:17.200]   When I understood, when somebody finally taught me that the efficient market hypothesis wasn't
[01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:21.840]   simply that all markets are always efficient all the time, but that there was the strong form,
[01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:27.040]   the weak form, and the semi-strong form. And I realized that, then it made all the sense in the
[01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:35.040]   world and helped me to understand that, yes, most markets are going to be fairly efficient.
[01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:41.360]   There's a reason why, if you go down a street, most of the gasoline prices on most of the gas
[01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:47.120]   stations on the street are about in the same. So you can't expect a lot of variation on if there
[01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:52.640]   were four gas stations within a mile, you can't expect a ton of variation. That's an efficiently
[01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:57.360]   priced market. There are exceptions, but that doesn't mean that there aren't macro trends that
[01:23:57.360 --> 01:24:02.080]   anybody can smell. And that doesn't mean that the herd, when people are simply following the herd,
[01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:06.960]   that you can't just simply find it. That you can't smell those things out. And I realized
[01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:15.840]   that all of us actually make bets and take trade positions based upon our outlooks on a market.
[01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:21.840]   And some ones that I've used come from personal finance side, not from the trading side,
[01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:27.280]   but from the personal finance side, of doing something like selecting a career or choosing
[01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:32.560]   to make a choice to go into college. If we make a choice to go to college or not go to college,
[01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:37.760]   or to send our children to college and pay the bill or to not, we're doing that based upon a bet
[01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:45.360]   that the market is going to pay off for that exchange. Now you see that changing. And you
[01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:50.080]   see people that made foolish bets and their $300,000 in debt for a humanities degree that's
[01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:54.720]   not a marketable commodity. And you say, "Huh, that trade didn't work out very well."
[01:24:54.720 --> 01:24:58.320]   Is that surprising to you, by the way?
[01:24:58.320 --> 01:25:03.360]   Right. Or you look at it with regard to the careers that we choose. The reason that people
[01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:09.280]   choose careers often has to do with their personal proclivity in one direction or another,
[01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:13.920]   but also based upon this is an industry that is growing. There are more people choosing to go
[01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:20.720]   into computer science now than there are choosing to go into, my mind fails me for a suitable
[01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:25.680]   metaphor, but into industries that are in decline. And so we're always looking at these things on a
[01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:30.640]   macro basis. And then if you actually look at real life, you can drive through a neighborhood
[01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:35.120]   and you can get an idea, is this a neighborhood that's in decline or in advance?
[01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:39.280]   It's not even like you have to really ruminate.
[01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:39.680]   Right.
[01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:40.080]   I mean, it's so obvious.
[01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:40.640]   You can drive through.
[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:47.680]   And you can tell what's happening with an industry. You can get an indication of what's
[01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:52.720]   going on with a company if you actually sit down and read their annual reports. And if you actually
[01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:58.960]   sit down and follow the news of a company, you can tell, is this company in general doing well?
[01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:06.640]   But markets have become so abstract to most of us. And because it's not something that we follow,
[01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:14.080]   I have no idea what the Dow Jones Industrial Average is going to do on any random day. I don't.
[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:18.800]   But I do know what's happening in my industry. And I take bets on the things that are close to me.
[01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:25.280]   So I don't find it easy to explain. But a lot of the academic research that you look at,
[01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:29.360]   you look at it and say, man, there's holes in this a mile wide. And yes, I get that when
[01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:36.400]   you're comparing mutual fund managers of a public open-ended mutual fund based upon these criteria,
[01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:40.720]   yeah, I understand that. But that doesn't necessarily mean that I as an individual
[01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:45.280]   can't identify a trend. After all, there's a reason why I started this podcast at the time
[01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:50.240]   that I did. I said, I can't sit by for another two years to get all of my ducks in a row,
[01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:56.240]   to be sitting fat and happy on $150,000 in my checking account to cash flow me for four years.
[01:26:56.240 --> 01:27:02.480]   Like this is the time. And I need to be in front of this trend. And I need to build the skills that
[01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:08.400]   I need so that as this grows and grows and grows, that my offering is there able to compete in the
[01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:14.000]   open market. Like we can't, you can time things if you know the industry, you can get the idea
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:19.840]   is, you know, are the, is Detroit growing or falling? Anyone who lives in Detroit should
[01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:25.200]   have been able to smell that one a long time ago. Yeah. Yeah. I think what we didn't anticipate,
[01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:30.080]   and I certainly didn't, were the bankruptcies. So, you know, in American Automotive,
[01:27:30.720 --> 01:27:36.560]   I never thought that they would let GM, you know, fail. You know what I mean? It's like,
[01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:45.040]   what's going on here? So I think in certain sectors, you can, you can still underestimate
[01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:53.760]   the downside. But then again, I've never been, you know, invested in auto. I think stick to what,
[01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:59.360]   you know, is, is a good, good way to go, but also don't limit yourself to what you know,
[01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:04.240]   get to know the things, you know, but, but remember what you know, and remember that there's
[01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:11.840]   so much hype out there. There's so, you know, so-and-so, you know, there's an upgrade or downgrade.
[01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:19.760]   It's now a B minus. It was a C plus, you know, our price target is 45 instead of 50. You know,
[01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:26.080]   that's all just BS. You know, that's just a guy, you know, saying, okay, well, we, we have to say
[01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:30.800]   something here. What are we going to say? Okay, let's say, and then you see the market react.
[01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:36.960]   And if you know that company, you know, what's going on with them. You can look at that with,
[01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:42.880]   you know, some distance. Oh my goodness. That's such BS. You see an upgrade, you see a big spike
[01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:48.800]   for two or three days and you go, is that really warranted? You can short it, man. You can make
[01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:53.200]   some, no, I mean, you, you can just trust yourself. I've, I've seen it happen over and over
[01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:58.480]   again. You can fade things. You know, you see, you see a security go down, you know, a couple percent,
[01:28:58.480 --> 01:29:05.120]   couple, 3%. And you're like, why, what was there just some bulk sale, bulk selling today? What's
[01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:11.840]   the deal? You can buy these little dips and, and, you know, don't necessarily have to rely on
[01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:19.200]   making all your income off one trade, but you can make some. So yeah, get to know, get to know
[01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:26.880]   small pieces of the market and, and leave the rest to the fools because most of them are fools.
[01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:34.160]   Do you have any formal way of tracking your returns in an academically rigorous way? Or do
[01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:40.000]   you have a gut instinct on years that you've, that you've done well, years that you haven't done well?
[01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.480]   Do you have any personal data that you're willing to share?
[01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:49.680]   Yes, I do track everything. No, I'm not willing to share everything. I would say that
[01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:56.480]   I outperform, how, how you want to slice and dice my portfolio is, you know, you know,
[01:29:56.480 --> 01:30:04.080]   changes those numbers. Right now I I'm invested in real estate. And so those numbers are just
[01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:09.440]   estimates, you know, based on a return. If I liquidate, you know, next month, but that to me,
[01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:13.920]   because I don't just see the home as, or the house as a home, I see it as an investment.
[01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:19.920]   Those matter to my overall portfolio. If you look at my total portfolio, I'm something on the order
[01:30:19.920 --> 01:30:31.120]   of, let's just say 18 to 25% annually. I have traded options, you know, very lightly in the
[01:30:31.120 --> 01:30:39.040]   last year because I've basically been invested. I've let the market do everything for me. I've
[01:30:39.040 --> 01:30:46.320]   been long. So if you look at the return on my options plays, it's meager, it's small, it's,
[01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:55.600]   you know, probably 8%, 10% last year. But in 2013, it was definitely double digits,
[01:30:55.600 --> 01:31:03.200]   maybe close to 20%. So it really depends how you slice and dice it. But I'm happy enough with my
[01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:10.480]   returns that I just don't stick everything into an index fund and let it ride. Although I recognize
[01:31:10.480 --> 01:31:17.760]   that, you know, I may be putting more work into this than needs to be, you know, I, you know,
[01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:24.080]   especially as the market's been in the last three plus years, you know, I could have been in any
[01:31:24.080 --> 01:31:30.960]   fund and done probably just about as well with my hands off approach. But I like the control.
[01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:38.000]   I like the responsibility. I like the ability to make moves, you know, on a whim.
[01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:43.680]   I think it's interesting in the field of advice, the people that I always say,
[01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:47.840]   here's the general advice. And if you're the kind of person who ignores the general advice,
[01:31:47.840 --> 01:31:50.320]   you're the kind of person who probably should ignore the general advice.
[01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:56.000]   So should most people probably go and put their money in an index fund and go and focus on
[01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:59.600]   something that's different, like making a lot of money in their career or going and doing something
[01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:03.120]   to do. Yes. But if you're the kind of person that ignores that advice, you're probably the
[01:32:03.120 --> 01:32:08.160]   kind of person that's willing to do what's necessary to actually, you know, to do something
[01:32:08.160 --> 01:32:13.200]   different. Yeah. Yeah. You know, and as we're getting ready for our first sailing trip,
[01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:18.960]   we had never met with a financial advisor before. And we had a really good idea of where our assets
[01:32:18.960 --> 01:32:24.640]   were, gave you an idea of what we're what our net worth was. But we still visited with
[01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:31.760]   a financial advisor, Brad Elman out of the Bay Area. He's a he's a great guy. And we just put
[01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:36.880]   everything down on paper and he gave us an idea of where we stood compared to other people at
[01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:46.400]   our stage of life. And it gave us some confidence. So. I don't think that just your average Joe
[01:32:46.400 --> 01:32:50.960]   should be out there managing their own money, I think, you know, if they're interested,
[01:32:50.960 --> 01:32:54.960]   they should certainly learn how to trade. I think most people probably should learn how to trade.
[01:32:55.520 --> 01:33:01.440]   But is it essential if you're focusing on other things? Now, if you want to go travel, you've got
[01:33:01.440 --> 01:33:06.960]   and you're not insanely wealthy. Can you make enough money to support travel habit?
[01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:15.200]   Depending on your initial trading night? I think so. So, again, I would direct them towards any of
[01:33:15.200 --> 01:33:24.480]   the introductory trading books like options, option volatility and pricing. That's by Nietenberg.
[01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:30.640]   Or, you know, pick up our book. Our book is definitely introductory material. If you're
[01:33:30.640 --> 01:33:37.040]   interested in trading options or just trading on the road. Another book that I would recommend.
[01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:44.240]   And this is somewhat newer ideas is something by Nassim Taleb. Are you familiar with him?
[01:33:44.240 --> 01:33:50.560]   I am. Yeah. Nicholas Taleb, Anti-Fragile. If you want to look at how non-linearity
[01:33:51.520 --> 01:34:00.880]   can be extremely profitable, I would pick that book up. Again, that's Anti-Fragile or Google
[01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:05.760]   Nassim Taleb on the Internet. You're going to find some really interesting stuff,
[01:34:05.760 --> 01:34:12.800]   new ways to look at old ideas. And I found it very enlightening. But yeah, I think, you know,
[01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:19.920]   you can you can manage your own money and probably outperform most of the active funds.
[01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:27.440]   But it does take time and education and experience and you can expect to lose along the way. So
[01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:33.360]   there's a huge, huge caveat there is, you know, if you've if you're really risk averse, man,
[01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:39.440]   just just to get the fund. Right. Right. Any other resources in addition to those four,
[01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:43.200]   or excuse me, those three that you mentioned, option, volatility and pricing?
[01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:47.680]   You're in your and Patrick's book Live on the Margin and then Anti-Fragile. Any other
[01:34:47.680 --> 01:34:51.760]   resources that would be useful to help somebody start to learn about trading?
[01:34:51.760 --> 01:34:58.480]   I would say, you know, I can't remember who wrote it, but there's a book called The Options
[01:34:58.480 --> 01:35:02.960]   Playbook. And I feel like it's a really good, simple playbook that shows you a bunch of
[01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:11.280]   strategies because, you know, there's buying and selling, writing calls, puts, covered options,
[01:35:11.280 --> 01:35:19.360]   naked options. But there's there's endless variations of iron this and condor that. And
[01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:25.680]   there's a lot of different ways to play with options. I think options are a great way to
[01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:33.280]   to make your money go further. They're certainly much more risky. But as soon as you understand
[01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:39.600]   what they are, you'll see that you're probably already using options in other parts of your
[01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:45.920]   life. Like a mortgage on your home is in a way an option. You don't actually own the house that
[01:35:45.920 --> 01:35:52.240]   you have a mortgage on. The bank does. And you have the option, really. And you pay them your
[01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:58.800]   interest rate for the option on your house. So I would definitely take a look at options if you're
[01:35:58.800 --> 01:36:05.360]   interested in upping your exposure to risk. I think one of the truest things in life is,
[01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:10.160]   you know, the higher the risk, the higher the reward. So, yeah, you can play it safe. But if
[01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:15.440]   you are hungry for more in your life, I'd say take the risks. You'll be fine no matter what.
[01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:20.480]   Do you have any last question? Do you have any,
[01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:28.960]   I guess, do you have a sniff test that you've developed over the years? Anything that because
[01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:34.560]   especially when you start into the option world, man, is there a lot of junk out there? Do you
[01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:40.800]   have any like a smell test that you develop that would help somebody to make wise choices and avoid
[01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:46.400]   being swindled out of their money? Specifically with regard to trading education is what I'm
[01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:52.320]   asking about. You know, to be perfectly honest with you, I don't have enough familiarity with
[01:36:52.320 --> 01:37:00.400]   other educators. I think that options look very complicated on the surface and there's a million
[01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:05.600]   different ways. I think there's even an options trading for dummies book out there. You can get
[01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:16.960]   mechanics down by reading any of these introductory books. I don't know who to trust in terms of
[01:37:16.960 --> 01:37:26.080]   trading advice. I generally don't give trading advice myself. So I don't know what to look out
[01:37:26.080 --> 01:37:33.360]   for. But I would say anybody who promises huge returns, if you follow this simple strategy or
[01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:42.160]   anybody who wants a lot of money up front for some sort of hand holding, I would be wary of that.
[01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:47.920]   So I don't know. Does that answer your question? No, well, it's good enough. It's just an
[01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:53.360]   interesting, I know it's a challenging jungle for people to navigate and it's always good to have a
[01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:58.800]   guide when you're going someplace unfamiliar for the first time. So yeah, I was looking for those
[01:37:58.800 --> 01:38:04.320]   resources for people. You know, Pat and I have, you know, we've had lots of requests to further
[01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:12.160]   develop Live on the Margin into a course or forum or a podcast or something like that. And I'm not
[01:38:12.160 --> 01:38:18.800]   sure exactly what form that will take. Pat Schulte, and people should definitely Google
[01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:28.080]   Pat Schulte or bumfuzzle.com to hear more about his story. Pat is really a master trader. And I
[01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:33.840]   think he has talked about actually mentoring some people. You'd want to contact him about that.
[01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:41.520]   But, you know, I don't think that you want to go out and look for somebody who's going to do
[01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:46.320]   everything for you. I think you want to learn how to do it for yourself. So again, anybody who's
[01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:52.640]   like pointing you towards a particular penny stock or something like that, just run. But somebody
[01:38:52.640 --> 01:38:58.960]   who's actually going to explain, you know, why should you buy out of the money in this particular
[01:38:58.960 --> 01:39:03.680]   case, out of the money being options trading term. You know, that's what you want. You want
[01:39:03.680 --> 01:39:07.360]   somebody who can answer your questions, not somebody who's going to point you in a particular
[01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:12.560]   direction. Right. Well, I'll look forward to seeing what you guys come up with. Nick, I thank
[01:39:12.560 --> 01:39:16.160]   you so much for taking your time to come on. I've really enjoyed this. And I think this will be a
[01:39:16.160 --> 01:39:22.000]   useful, useful resource for people with a little bit of inspiration, a little bit of education to
[01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:27.120]   go out and have fun with their own adventures. Yeah. Thanks so much, man. I really appreciate
[01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:32.080]   your time and I appreciate what you're doing and keep at it. And I think you're changing
[01:39:32.080 --> 01:39:36.720]   people's lives. I think that's just about all we can force people. I appreciate that.
[01:39:39.280 --> 01:39:44.080]   Pretty cool to think of all the things that you can accomplish. I just get so inspired talking
[01:39:44.080 --> 01:39:49.120]   with guys like Nick, talking like guys with guys like Patrick when I interviewed him, Pat,
[01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:58.880]   his co-author. I just I love having my own, I guess, vision expanded. Super fun just to hear
[01:39:58.880 --> 01:40:03.600]   of the things that are possible. I hope that was useful to you. If you'd like more, I'll put links
[01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:09.120]   to Nick's blog. He doesn't really write much online. Most of his thoughts, I know he wrote a
[01:40:09.120 --> 01:40:14.320]   book called Get Her On Board, which is all about how to get your spouse to go sailing with you. I
[01:40:14.320 --> 01:40:18.640]   meant in the interview to ask him more about that and I completely forgot. But he also wrote the
[01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:22.960]   book Live on the Margin and it's quite good. You can pick up the Kindle version. I'll post a link
[01:40:22.960 --> 01:40:29.360]   in the show notes. It's very good. It's really fun. And if you want to get just a hardcore slap
[01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:34.240]   in the face about spending too much money, about why you're spending too much money and why you're
[01:40:34.240 --> 01:40:39.120]   allowing yourself to live a crazy lifestyle and how you can quickly free yourself a little bit,
[01:40:39.120 --> 01:40:43.600]   then check it out. One of the things that I most enjoyed from Live on the Margin
[01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:51.440]   was actually Nick and Pat's discussion of risk. They talk a lot about that and risk is one of
[01:40:51.440 --> 01:40:55.840]   those things that we all have to think about. We all have to look at our own levels of what we're
[01:40:55.840 --> 01:41:01.200]   comfortable with. But coming from two traders, they apply essentially a trading mentality to
[01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:06.160]   the idea of risk, especially with other things, other aspects of life and life risk. And it's
[01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:11.680]   well worth reading for that alone. I'm not sure that you're going to pick it up. I am sure that
[01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:17.760]   you're not going to pick it up and be able to go out and make massive percentages, rates of return
[01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:24.640]   on your own trading plan from it. But I know they worked hard to get together and write a good
[01:41:24.640 --> 01:41:30.480]   intro to trading. So hopefully it could be useful to some of you, at least to wet your toes in the
[01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:36.080]   water. But like I said in the beginning, it's a very interesting mashup of stock trading and
[01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:40.160]   life advice. So check it out. I'll put a link in the notes. That's it for today. I thank you so
[01:41:40.160 --> 01:41:45.680]   much for listening. I will be back with you tomorrow. I might be back with you with an
[01:41:45.680 --> 01:41:52.160]   interview or if I can, if I can get everything done, I'll be back with you to tell you about
[01:41:52.160 --> 01:41:56.320]   the future of the financial support for the show and ask for your support even more. Talk to you
[01:41:56.320 --> 01:41:58.400]   tomorrow.
