[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640]   Okay, so this video is designed to go with the Huberman Lab Podcast solo episode where I talk
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.840]   about how to strengthen and pain-proof your back. I'm going to show you the so-called McGill's Big
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.680]   Threes, so-called because they were developed by Dr. Stuart McGill, an expert in spine physiology.
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.560]   I'm also going to show you a psoas stretch, and I'm also going to show you a what sort of looks
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:27.040]   like a cobra pose in yoga. It's a certain kind of up-dog push-up where it's not a real push-up,
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.680]   but that too can be used to both pain-proof and strengthen the back, especially if you're
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.640]   experiencing some bulging, that is some herniation of the discs. One thing to keep in mind is that
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:43.440]   every body, everybody, is different in the sense that some people can do these movements with a
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.200]   little more arch in their neck or a little more holding of the neck in neutral position than
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.800]   others can without pain and with stability. So you'll see examples of these exercises
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.880]   multiple places online, and everyone does them slightly differently. What you're about to see
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:07.120]   are the core elements of the Big Three, the psoas stretch, and the up-dogs or cobra push-up for
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:13.280]   relieving some stress on impinged nerves as a consequence of bulging or herniation of the discs.
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.480]   Again, everyone does these slightly differently. Work within the range that is challenging for
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.520]   you, but that doesn't cause or exacerbate any pain for you. All that said, the exercises I'm
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.120]   about to show you require minimal time investment, no equipment, can be done by most everyone
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.680]   pain-free, and have been shown to be very beneficial for strengthening and pain-proofing
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.440]   your back. Okay, so the first exercise in McGill's Big Three is the curl-up. The curl-up is essentially
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:46.240]   where you lie down like so with, at first, legs extended. This is where you're going to start.
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:53.360]   You're going to take your hands and, with palms down, and you're going to put them in the small
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.840]   of your back, so in the arch of your back, and you actually want to maintain that arch in your back.
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:05.360]   Probably want to make your spine nice and long. Put one knee up with the leg flat, the other leg
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.520]   is extended, and then you're going to, again, keep the spine long, meaning you're not going to move
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.200]   the chin towards the chest too much. You're just going to keep it in a neutral position as if you
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.440]   were looking straight forward, or in this case, straight up at the ceiling, and then you're
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.760]   essentially going to, you could keep the elbows down, or you can float the elbows, which is a
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.680]   little bit more difficult. I'll float the elbows, and then you lift your upper torso just a bit,
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.680]   and of course, the head goes with it, but you're not going to lead with the head, you're going to
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.040]   lead with the chest. Okay, like so, and as you do that, I'm trying to talk while I'm doing this,
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.280]   you'll feel a nice hard contraction in the abdominals, okay? You're going to hold for
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.600]   about 10 seconds, and as you do that, you're not going to want to talk like I am now. You're going
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.120]   to want to put the tongue on the roof of your mouth, breathe through your nose, and exhale,
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:04.560]   and then you're going to relax down to the floor again, set the head down.
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.400]   You might want to rest somewhere between 10 and 30 seconds, depending on
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.120]   your particular needs, and then you're going to raise up your torso,
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.760]   leading with the chest, letting the head follow,
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:30.880]   holding for about 10 seconds. You can really get a nice hard contraction of the abdominals there,
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.560]   which is going to help to build stability. The reason, as I describe in the episode,
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.880]   for doing these 10-second holds as opposed to a 30-second set or a minute-long set is that
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.560]   repeated 10-second holds help you to build the neural pathways that allow you to contract those
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:50.160]   muscles very hard, which is the goal here. So, after repeating that, say, three to five times
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:58.800]   per set, okay? So, one set would be, say, three to five 10-second holds with 10 to 30, maybe 60
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.560]   seconds between each hold. It'll be one set with the knee up. You could perform multiple sets with
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.400]   this knee up and then switch to the other side. I talk about this in the episode. I recommend
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.240]   starting with just one set per side and then progressing to about three sets per side. You're
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:18.640]   going to switch to the other side in this case. So, here, again, it's a nice long spine,
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:27.600]   this leg extended, this foot planted with a bend in the knee. Use the tops of your hands,
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.600]   so palms down, to find the small of your back. Put your tongue on the roof of your mouth.
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.480]   Float the elbows if you can. Otherwise, you can keep the elbows down if you're not able to do that,
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.240]   and then just lift the upper torso and hold for 10 seconds.
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:55.920]   And down. And then you would repeat several times or more for this side, and then you could go back
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:02.160]   to the other leg, or simply do all the sets for one leg extended, then all the sets for the other
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.800]   leg extended. I talk about sets and reps, et cetera, in the episode on how to strengthen and
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:12.160]   pain-proof your back. This is a great exercise because it actually takes advantage of the
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.760]   ability to contract the abdominals much harder in this position and more efficiently than crunches
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.480]   done the conventional way. And I also talk about in the episode how crunches done the conventional
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:27.280]   way can often exacerbate disc herniation and bulging, whereas this should not. Although,
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.680]   again, if you experience pain or exacerbation of pain from doing this, you should cease to do it.
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:37.440]   So that's the curl-up. Okay, so the next exercise in Stu McGill's Big Three is the side plank.
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.840]   And the side plank can be done through a number of different progressions, which many people find
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.320]   they have to start with the easiest one and work their way up to the more difficult forms of the
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:52.880]   side plank. So the side plank, as the name suggests, is where you get on your side. The easiest way to
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:59.520]   start this, meaning to begin this exercise if you haven't done it before, is to do a kind of right
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:05.760]   angle bend in the arm that's in contact with the ground. You make a fist on that side. The knees
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:12.960]   are bent, okay, and the feet are stacked. And then you're going to both lift the hips off the ground,
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:19.200]   but also push down hard with the arm and the fist that's in contact with the floor. That's important.
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:24.480]   And it essentially looks like this, okay. So the idea is to not let the hips sag like so,
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:30.320]   to try and generate as much of a hard contraction in the abdominal muscles and the muscles of the
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:36.560]   core that are on the side here, okay. So that's the first progression you would hold for 10 seconds or
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:44.480]   so. I'm not counting exactly. Tongue on the roof of your mouth, and then let down, okay. Maybe rest
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:57.600]   10, 30, maybe 60 seconds if you need to, and then repeat. Focusing hard on pushing the ground away.
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:04.480]   The next progression after doing this with the legs and feet stacked with the arm at 90 degrees
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:09.440]   would be to do it with the arm straight. You can do this with a fist if you're really strong. I'm
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:14.880]   still working up to that. Or you can do it with hand planted like so. So I'd probably suggest
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:20.640]   starting with the foot here. You can really feel a strong contraction there. Then moving to it with
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:24.720]   feet stacked. And this is really fatiguing me. You can see some quaking in that arm.
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:32.480]   Clearly I have some progression to work through. And relax. Okay, so that's the side plank. And of
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:42.960]   course you would do it on the other side as well, like so. Really emphasizing pushing the floor away.
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:47.040]   And there are a bunch of variations on these as well. There's some rotational stuff you can do.
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:52.640]   Some people like to do arms ahead or the foot floating. Those are harder progressions. You
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:57.600]   can find all of these online very easily, as you can tell because I'm breathing hard now.
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:00.720]   I've worked up to the point where I can do the feet stacked one for the sets,
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:05.600]   but I'm still working through the progressions of the side plank. Okay, the third exercise in
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:11.440]   McGill's Big Three is the bird dog. Love that name because I love birds and I love dogs.
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:14.480]   And basically what you do is you're going to get down on all fours like so.
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:22.800]   You're going to at first plant your hands, plant your knees. Then what you're going to do is you're
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:28.640]   going to actively push the ground away with one hand. That's important. You're going to raise up
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:35.120]   the other one and into a fist. That's important. I explain why in the episode on how to strengthen
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:41.360]   and pain-proof your back. And then you're going to extend the opposite leg to the one where the
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:47.680]   arm is extended. Okay, so opposite side. And I explain the logic behind this in the episode.
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:52.320]   Okay, some common mistakes are that people arch the back too much and raise this leg too much.
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:57.280]   You don't need to do that. You just want to raise it up. Some people will point the toe,
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:02.480]   it's fine to point the toe or to just keep heel to the ceiling. You're going to actively reach
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:06.560]   with this fist out in front. Okay, and you're going to actively push down. You'll really feel
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:10.320]   that contraction in the core. It takes some concentration to make sure that you're activating
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:15.440]   your core, tongue on the roof of your mouth, neck in a slightly arched position. Neutral
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:20.960]   is okay too, looking forward. And then if you want to make this a little bit tougher,
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:28.960]   you can do some circles or squares with the extended leg and hand in both directions.
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:34.160]   If you want to make it even harder, you can gently, while maintaining
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:41.600]   contraction of the core, touch your hand to your knee and back out. Definitely don't just,
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:45.520]   you know, swing the hand in and touch your knee. Go back and move it nice and slow so you can feel
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:55.120]   the contraction in your core. Go for at least a 10-second hold with the repeats as described in
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:10:01.760]   the episode before you start doing some of these kind of square movements and touches, etc.
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:07.120]   And then down. Okay, and then you need to repeat for the other side. So actively pressing down,
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:12.080]   that's a key feature here. You know, fist out in front and reaching, tongue on the roof of your
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:20.400]   mouth, opposite leg extended. Don't go too high. You're not trying to get a steep arch in the
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:27.440]   lower back, just get that core contraction. Take some concentration and then hold for at least 10
[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:36.160]   seconds. Helps to exhale. And if you want, you can do some of these movements. You can do the nice
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:45.360]   slow touching of the fist to the knee, keeping that contraction in the core. And out. Keeping
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:55.120]   contraction in the core. And out. Building spine and core and upper back stability.
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:11:04.320]   That's the bird dog. Okay, so the next exercise is a psoas stretch. The psoas, as described in
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:10.320]   the episode, is a muscle that attaches the spine to the pelvis. Does some other things too. It's
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:13.920]   involved with the diaphragm, which of course is involved in your breathing. And guess what? Your
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:18.480]   diaphragm is also involved in your heart rate, regulating your heart rate by virtue of how much
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:22.880]   space there is in the thoracic cavity. So a lot of interesting stuff about the psoas. You can read up,
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:27.440]   you can learn more about it in the episode. But stretching your psoas is wonderful. It both can
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:33.680]   provide some relief for tightness in the hips, challenges in breathing, especially after sitting,
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:37.680]   for relieving pressure on certain nerve roots. And there are a bunch of other benefits as well.
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:42.880]   It's very easy to do. It more or less looks like a warrior two pose in yoga. And forgive me,
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:48.000]   I'm not a trained yogi. I've taken a few yoga classes in my day, however. And what you're
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.560]   essentially going to do is get into a lunge where the front knee is a little bit bent. This is going
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:56.800]   to depend a little bit on your degree of flexibility. Again, every body is different.
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:00.880]   But what you're essentially going to do here is you're going to go into a lunge, which this,
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:05.760]   for me, I can start to feel a stretch on my hip here. And then you're going to raise the arm on
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:11.280]   the side for which the leg is behind you. And you're going to put the palm of your hand to
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:17.520]   the ceiling. And then you're going to turn your pinky towards your head and really reach and then
[00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:22.800]   move into the lunge a little bit deeper. So now I'm getting a deeper stretch in the hip
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:30.480]   flexor. Really feeling it all the way from the hip flexor up through the psoas, through the arm,
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:35.840]   and you can really reach, reach, reach, reach, reach. Exhale, again, tongue on the roof of your
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:43.280]   mouth. Eyes can be forward or eyes can be up. And relax. You would repeat that three or five times
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:47.920]   per side and call that one set. And then you would do it for the other side. So like so.
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:56.240]   Again, and by the way, the heel of my back foot is off the ground. Some people prefer
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:01.360]   and/or can do it with their heel in contact. If of course I tighten my stance, I can do it
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:07.040]   with the heel in contact. I prefer to do it this way with my back heel up, front foot completely
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:14.880]   planted. And then it's lunge forward until I start to feel a stretch in the hip flexor here.
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:22.880]   And arm goes up. My eyes are up, in my case, palm parallel to the floor,
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:29.120]   parallel to the ceiling, and then turning the pinky toward my head,
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:34.800]   exhaling through my nose, tongue on the roof of the mouth.
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:43.520]   Again, I can feel the stretch the whole way down and back to the toes. We talk about some of the
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:50.560]   fascial, that is the fascia aspects of this, the neural aspects and the neuromuscular aspects in
[00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:56.960]   the episode on how to strengthen and pain-proof your back. You might do that for one to five
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:01.120]   sets, depending on how much time you have, how much work you're trying to put into strengthening
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:05.040]   and pain-proofing your back. As you can see, you can do this in work clothes. These are not my
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:08.560]   workout clothes. These are my work clothes. And generally you can do it without working up a
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:12.080]   sweat. I've got a little bit of perspiration here because I'm putting a lot of effort into it and
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:15.760]   I'm talking at the same time, but you can essentially do these anywhere. Now, this last
[00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:20.160]   exercise was one that was taught to me by a guy named Grant Elliott, who has a terrific Instagram
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:25.120]   channel called Rehab Fix. It's a back exercise designed to relieve pain when you're getting
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:29.440]   some bulging, that is herniation of the disc that's impinging on the nerves. For me, that was
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:35.760]   about an L3, L4 impingement. It was so bad that I could barely walk. I was like doubled over like
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:40.880]   this. I could barely walk. I didn't know what to do. I thought maybe I needed surgery or I need
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:46.560]   pain meds. Some people, yes, do need surgery and or pain meds for lower back injuries and pain.
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:51.920]   But in my case, what Grant Elliott instructed me to do, which helped immediately and resolve the
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:58.160]   whole thing within just a couple of days, was to do a sort of cobra pose pushup. So, what I do,
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:03.520]   so I'll get down on the floor like so. I put my hands more or less at clavicle level,
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:08.400]   a little bit behind, maybe in line with my chest. My feet are together and pointed back.
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:14.320]   My elbows are back and then I push up off the ground. Again, tongue on the roof of the mouth.
[00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:22.320]   Sometimes I'll go up higher like so, but usually it's just to about here and then release
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:30.800]   and relax. And then I'll repeat doing about anywhere from three to five second holds.
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:37.120]   I'll do that for maybe five to 10 repetitions.
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:42.560]   I'm going to do fewer now for sake of time. And then on the last repetition, I'll hold,
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:51.680]   trying to go long with the spine, for anywhere from 10 to 30 seconds,
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:59.520]   and then relax. And I'll do that several times throughout the day. It helped tremendously and
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:05.440]   immediately to relieve my back pain, which was, again, excruciating, was also causing pain in the
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:10.320]   hip and down the leg. If you listen to the episode on how to strengthen and pain-proof your back,
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:15.600]   at least for the back pain that I had, where there was a disc impingement on a nerve root
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:21.600]   and the direction of the herniation of the disc was that away towards my back,
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:26.720]   it made perfect sense. It does make perfect sense why that would help relieve it because
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:31.120]   it's essentially taking that disc and encouraging it to move back under those vertebrae, so to speak.
[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:35.040]   I realize that's not the technical term. For other types of back pain, you might need to
[00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:39.920]   do a slightly different variation or avoid that variation. For instance, if the impingement is
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:46.400]   in the front, that exercise would actually exacerbate it. However, what I was doing prior
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:52.560]   to that exercise, such as crunches, was actually making the disc herniation worse. So that exercise
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:56.800]   I just showed you was the way that I relieve my back pain and many others that I know have used
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:02.480]   it to relieve their back pain because it was caused by the same disc herniation pattern.
[00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:07.600]   Okay, so that's the cobra push-up, sort of up-dog type cobra push-up. I don't have a better name
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:11.680]   for it. Maybe you can come up with a better name for it. Put that in the comment section below.
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:14.000]   I'll take a tally and we'll go with the top one from here.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.760]   Okay, so that's McGill's Big Three, meaning that's the curl-up, the side plank, and the bird dog.
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:25.600]   I also showed you this in a warrior two pose with the palm towards the ceiling, which is designed to
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:30.160]   stretch the psoas and involves some fascial stretching as well and some activation of the
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:34.560]   entire pathway from hand to hip and provides a really terrific stretch. Obviously, you want to
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:41.520]   do those both sides. And this cobra push-up/up-dog thing that can, in many cases, provide relief for
[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:46.480]   the nerve roots that are being impinged upon by a bulging or herniated disc. At least that's what
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:50.800]   it did for me. Hope you found those useful. Again, lots of variations on these. You can find them on
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:54.800]   the internet. You can find them in Stu McGill's book and other resources. We provided links to
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:59.760]   the various people as well as the book resources and a few other videos that are going to be useful
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:05.120]   for you as you try to navigate back pain and strengthen your back and pain-proof your back.
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:08.560]   And of course, please check out the full-length episode of the Huberman Lab podcast that I did
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:12.560]   all about how to strengthen and pain-proof your back. It gets into all the logic, the science,
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:16.960]   the details, and of course, protocols. And last but certainly not least,
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:20.880]   thank you for ignoring the color of the carpet and thank you for your interest in science.
