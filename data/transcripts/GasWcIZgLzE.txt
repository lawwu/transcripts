[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.320]   Welcome back on This Monday. Thank you for listening to the podcast. Well, there are
[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:15.600]   many factors that would disqualify a man from holding the office of elder or pastor in a
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.600]   local church. And that raises an important discussion about a man's history. To what
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:26.200]   extent does a man's sinful past come into play in his qualification or lack of qualification
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:31.360]   today, specifically when that sin is sexual sin? That's the question from a young man
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.960]   we have now. "Dear Pastor Jen, hello. Ever since I was converted about four years ago,
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.560]   I've felt a strong desire to pursue full-time pastoring. My heart's desire is to serve the
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.920]   Lord and the flock for the rest of my life. And that desire has only grown more intense
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.160]   as time goes on. Not only this, but in this past year, the Lord has set before me everything
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.560]   needed to pursue this, like seminary training and support from my elders. There's just one
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:06.120]   major question I must answer now. Does my pre-conversion life of fornication disqualify
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:14.160]   me for pastoral ministry now? I have repented, but that life was filled to the brim with
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.280]   sin. According to 1 Corinthians 6.16, I became one flesh with a girl I committed this sin
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.880]   with. I'm unmarried now. But considering 1 Timothy 3.2, does my sinful past disqualify
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:34.160]   me from eldership today?" No, I don't think your past fornication disqualifies you for
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:43.480]   ministry, not in and of itself. And the reason I say it like that is because it would be
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:54.000]   part of what disqualifies you if it was part of an ongoing character flaw of bondage to
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.880]   sensuality or pornography or lack of self-control. Past fornication need not disqualify from
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:10.720]   ministry unless it's part of an ongoing sinful, unsanctified blemish in the present.
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:20.320]   So let me step back then and give three, I think it's just three, reasons from Scripture
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:29.240]   why I think that's true. Why a man who is rebellious in the season of life, commits
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:39.840]   fornication, but has been free from that sin, repentant of its moral and spiritual Christ
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:51.400]   dishonoring ugliness for long enough to prove his genuine newness, why it may be right to
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.960]   consider that man for Christian ministry in Christ's church.
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:05.820]   So here's the first argument. Paul's example in his past life and present ministry with
[00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:13.160]   Christ's blessing is really quite astonishing because of the actual use he himself makes
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:21.640]   of that example. Paul was complicit in Stephen's murder in Acts 7. Then as he became a ringleader
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:28.440]   in the efforts to stamp out Christianity with imprisonments and murders, it got even worse
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:37.280]   and more intentional. Acts 9, verse 1, "Saul, still breathing threats and murder against
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:45.040]   the disciples of the Lord, went to Damascus." In short, Paul was a murderer, and murderers
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:51.680]   don't have eternal life in them, John said. Paul's own assessment of his pre-Christian
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:04:02.060]   life was that he was the worst, the foremost of sinners, and that God saved him and used
[00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:09.700]   him anyway precisely as an example to others who feel hopeless about their future possibilities
[00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:18.740]   of forgiveness and usefulness is a precious reality in Scripture. Here's the way he says
[00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:27.740]   it in 1 Timothy 1, 15 and 16, "The saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance
[00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:36.460]   that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners of whom I am the foremost, but I received
[00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.780]   mercy for this reason." And this is why it's so remarkable because he himself—we don't
[00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.540]   have to make this application—he's making the application. "I received mercy for this
[00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:55.700]   reason that in me, as the foremost, Jesus Christ might display his perfect patience
[00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:01.460]   as an example to those who were to believe in him for eternal life." So Paul gives his
[00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:11.260]   own experience of mercy as an example that I think extends to a person who may not have
[00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:18.620]   murdered but has in fact committed fornication. That's my first argument.
[00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:26.100]   Second, it's a little more complicated because the young fellow that we're dealing with here,
[00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:33.860]   he's sharp. He has studied and he's thought through the possible blockages to his own
[00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:42.980]   eldership. He's asking a more sophisticated question. He says, he asks, on the basis of
[00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:54.660]   1 Corinthians 6, 16, whether in fact fornication is a unique kind of sin that may exclude from
[00:05:54.660 --> 00:06:00.860]   ministry when in fact murder may not. Now that's a thoughtful question because of the
[00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:10.620]   way Paul argues against fornication in 1 Corinthians 6. And because 1 Timothy 3, 2, which he refers
[00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:19.460]   to, in that text Paul says that a minister in the church must be the husband of one wife,
[00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:27.620]   which some translate a one-woman man. That's a pretty common paraphrase, a one-woman man.
[00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:37.040]   In other words, our friend, this young fellow, wonders if he can qualify as a one-woman man
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:42.260]   because he committed fornication. That's the way he's thinking, which is a good way to
[00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:46.720]   think. I mean, it's a good question to ask. It means he's not weaseling. He's not trying
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:52.240]   to squeak out of the rigors of Scripture. So let me try to clarify what I think Paul
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:58.360]   means by husband of one woman. That's important in the way his argument against himself is
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:07.160]   working and why one-woman man may be a misleading translation. I got a lot of friends that translate
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:15.200]   it that way, and I've got misgivings about that translation. Suppose your pastor is single.
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:21.040]   Now I think that's legitimate. Jesus is single. Paul is single. I think it's legitimate to
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:28.960]   have a single man for a pastor. Suppose your pastor is single and he commits fornication
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:37.640]   regularly with only one woman. Would he qualify as being a one-woman man? Well, good grief,
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:46.600]   Piper. Technically, yes, and we all know that's not what Paul meant. So translating husband
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:54.280]   of one woman as one-woman man can get us into difficulty if we're not careful. Paul really
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:08:01.400]   is dealing with marriage and whether a man is faithful to his wife, whether he commits
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:09.560]   adultery. Now, the question then becomes, what do we make of Paul's argument against
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:20.340]   fornication in 1 Corinthians 6? Because some might say, well, Paul really does argue that
[00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:27.660]   in essence a sexual relationship before marriage is a kind of marriage. And then our young
[00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:34.880]   friend might draw the conclusion, well, so I was in a sense married, and I'm not faithful
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:40.040]   to that girl today by not being married to her officially, not to mention that I can't
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:46.040]   even get married legitimately if I'm still married to her because that old relationship.
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:58.640]   Is that what Paul meant? He says in 1 Corinthians 6:14-18, "The body is not meant for sexual
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:08.000]   immorality," that is fornication, "but for the Lord and the Lord for the body. Do you
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   not know that your bodies," and here he's getting very specific. He means our sexual
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:21.920]   organs. "Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ?" So our body parts
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:30.260]   are Christ's body parts. "Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members
[00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:38.780]   of a prostitute?" And he cries out, "Never!" And then here's the tricky part. He argues
[00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:47.660]   like this, "Or do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute becomes one body
[00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:55.120]   with her?" And he quotes Genesis 2:24, which is about marriage. "For as it is written,
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:10:03.940]   the two shall become one flesh. But he who is joined to the Lord becomes one spirit with
[00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:11.660]   him." Flee from sexual immorality. That's the end of 1 Corinthians 6:14-18. So Paul
[00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:22.300]   portrays the horror of fornication for the Christian as taking the body parts of Christ,
[00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:29.500]   because ours are his, and making them body parts of a prostitute. That's how intimate
[00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:39.220]   and profound sexual intercourse is in Paul's apostolic-inspired mind. You become one body
[00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:47.540]   with her. What makes the text look ominous for our young friend is that Paul quotes Genesis
[00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:54.620]   2:24, which is a text about marriage. "The two shall become one flesh." So does Paul
[00:10:54.620 --> 00:11:04.020]   mean that in essence then the one who fornicates with a prostitute is married to her? That's
[00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:11.660]   what he wonders, so that he would be excluded because of 1 Timothy 3.2. And my answer is
[00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:19.420]   no. That's not what Paul means. He could have said that. He doesn't draw that inference
[00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:24.460]   or that conclusion. Wow, that would have been powerful. Wow. If he had said that, but he
[00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:32.380]   didn't go there. So what's he doing? I think what he's doing is this. He says, "What
[00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:41.860]   makes fornication so horrible is that it takes the one flesh design of marriage and prostitutes
[00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:50.780]   it." He prostitutes that part of marriage by stripping it out of the covenant relationship
[00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:57.700]   of marriage and treating it as though it was designed for a prostitute. It's precisely
[00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:05.380]   that this is not a marriage that makes the prostitution of Christ's body parts so horrible.
[00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:11.460]   The one flesh union designed for marriage, which represents Christ in the church, which
[00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:18.540]   is why it's not idolatry to have sex in marriage. Marriage is a representation of Christ in
[00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:25.020]   the church. To take it out of that, out of that sacred covenant with a wife and with
[00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:34.180]   Christ and prostitute it in fornication is what makes this fornication so horrible.
[00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:41.980]   So I conclude that Paul was not treating fornication as a kind of marriage. There is no covenant
[00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:48.320]   formed at all with this prostitute, and that is precisely what makes the sexual similarity
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:56.460]   to marriage so morally and spiritually ugly. Therefore, I don't think Paul's argument
[00:12:56.460 --> 00:13:06.220]   in 1 Corinthians 6 means that our young, repentant, transformed friend should use this text to
[00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:16.220]   argue that he's excluded from the eldership simply because of 1 Timothy 3.2, which says
[00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:24.700]   he must be the husband of one woman. One last observation, which is also precious.
[00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:32.700]   In this same chapter of 1 Corinthians 6, Paul specifically refers to fornication as something
[00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:42.860]   in the church that has been cleansed and forgiven. Verses 9 to 11, "Do not be deceived, the
[00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:47.940]   sexually immoral," and he's referring to fornication there because later he refers
[00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:54.940]   to adulterers. So he's distinguishing adultery and sexual morality here. "The sexually
[00:13:54.940 --> 00:14:05.220]   immoral will not inherit the kingdom of God, and such were some of you. But you were washed,
[00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:11.520]   you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:20.700]   Spirit of our God, to which I say, 'Praise God that any of us can be saved from our sin.'"
[00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:26.740]   So my conclusion is that the elders of this young man's church should—and if they're
[00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:33.740]   listening to me, greetings in the name of Jesus—the elders of this young man's church
[00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:40.540]   should carefully and biblically assess his qualifications for ministry and not let that
[00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:45.220]   past sin of fornication be decisive in excluding him.
[00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:50.660]   Thank you, Pastor John. Thank you for joining us today. We tackle a lot of tricky questions
[00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:54.940]   on the podcast, obviously, and many of them anonymously, like this question today. You
[00:14:54.940 --> 00:15:01.860]   can ask your own question, even anonymously, via email through our online home, AskPastorJohn.com.
[00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:11.080]   Well, John 9, verse 3 is a classic text for us at Desiring God, a go-to text for us when
[00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:18.040]   it comes to trying to understand God's good design in human disability. It's about the
[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:22.460]   man born blind. Next time we look at another part of that story, because as you may remember,
[00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:27.020]   Jesus healed that blind man by spitting on the ground, mixing his spit with dirt, making
[00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:33.180]   mud, applying the paste to the man's blind eyes, and then sending him off to a pool where
[00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:40.380]   he was washed and healed. So why the spit, and why the mud? It's a great question with
[00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:45.340]   two answers, up next. I'm your host Tony Rehnke. We'll see you back here on Wednesday.
[00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:47.340]   [END]
