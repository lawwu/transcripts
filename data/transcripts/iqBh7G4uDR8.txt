[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.700]   The following is a conversation with Diana Walsh-Pasulka,
[00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.460]   a professor of philosophy and religion at UNCW
[00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.260]   and author of American Cosmic, UFOs, Religion,
[00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.700]   and Technology.
[00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.000]   This book is one of the most fascinating explorations
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.300]   of the interconnected nature of technology,
[00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.860]   belief, and the mystery of alien intelligence.
[00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.480]   Quick mention of our sponsors, Element Electrolyte Drink,
[00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.460]   Grammarly Writing Plugin, Business Wars Podcast,
[00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.620]   and Cash App.
[00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:35.460]   So the choice is health, grammar, knowledge, or money.
[00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.100]   Choose wisely, my friends.

[00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.300]   As a side note, let me say, as I did in the recent video
[00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.460]   on how many intelligent alien civilizations are out there,
[00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.180]   that the nature of alien life, intelligence,
[00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.820]   and how they might communicate with us humans
[00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.240]   is likely stranger than we imagine.
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.060]   And perhaps stranger than we can imagine.
[00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.340]   What is most fascinating to me is how the belief
[00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.940]   in the communication with such civilizations
[00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.780]   changes people's understanding of the world.
[00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.020]   And as Diana argues, the technology we create.
[00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.940]   Technological innovation itself seems to manifest
[00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.740]   the mythology in our collective intelligence
[00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.820]   that turns the seemingly impossible into reality
[00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.540]   just a matter of years through the belief
[00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.380]   of individual humans that carry out that innovation.
[00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.960]   The nature and power of this belief in both technology
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.140]   and extraterrestrial intelligence
[00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.680]   is mysterious and fascinating.
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.880]   Perhaps holding the key to us humans
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.880]   understanding our own mind, our consciousness,
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.080]   and engineering versions of it in the machines we create.

[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.740]   And now, here's my conversation with Diana Walsh-Basulka.
[00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.360]   You are a scholar of religious belief,
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.300]   or belief in general.
[00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.640]   So, the fascinating question,
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.920]   what do you think is the difference between our beliefs
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.440]   and objective reality?
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.840]   What is real, period?
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:18.940]   - Sure, what is real?
[00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.200]   Easy question. (laughs)
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.160]   So, first let me start with belief.
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.080]   So, belief is generally,
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.400]   there are different definitions of belief
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.020]   just as there are different definitions of what is real.
[00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.200]   So, for belief in my field,
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.240]   it would be attitudes toward something
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.800]   that dictate our actions.
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.400]   So, we believe the sun is gonna rise tomorrow,
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.520]   therefore we act as if it will rise tomorrow.
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.120]   Beliefs can be wrong.
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.540]   For a long time, people believed,
[00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.280]   and actually some still do, that the earth was flat.
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.160]   Okay, well that's obviously an erroneous belief.
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.200]   So, beliefs can be wrong.
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.780]   Now, the bigger question that philosophers ask is,
[00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.320]   is this belief accurate toward
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.040]   what we consider to be objective reality?
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.940]   So, now let me go to objective reality.
[00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.320]   So, what is real?
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.580]   I don't think we can actually obtain
[00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.600]   a correct understanding of what is real.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.600]   And in that sense, I have to refer to a philosopher again,
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.460]   and that would be Immanuel Kant.
[00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.160]   So, Immanuel Kant is one of the,
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.200]   he was basically in the 1750s,
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.540]   he wrote "Critiques of Reason" and things like that.
[00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.200]   So, he said, "Well, if you're a philosopher
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.980]   "or have any kind of understanding of Western history,
[00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.600]   "you know who he is."
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.960]   He had this idea that we can actually never get
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.980]   to the thing in itself, okay?
[00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.760]   So, and he called that the noumenal, the thing in itself.
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.180]   He said, "Let's take this table, for instance,
[00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.140]   "that you and I are talking across.
[00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.860]   "So, this thing is a table.
[00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.140]   "You and I both know that.
[00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.540]   "We assume it's real.
[00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.860]   "We believe in it because we put our water on it,
[00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.360]   "and then our water stays on it, okay?
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.800]   "However, can we know this thing
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.640]   "in and of itself as a table?"
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:10.420]   So, that would be what he then would call the phenomenal.
[00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.500]   How do we know that that phenomena exists
[00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.820]   as we know it is, okay?
[00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:16.820]   How do we know?
[00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:17.700]   We use our faculties.
[00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.620]   So, we use our senses and things like that.
[00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.140]   But again, even our senses can be wrong.
[00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.780]   So, I've been on committees just recently,
[00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.700]   this year, last year, for hiring professors
[00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.660]   in my department who are philosophers.
[00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.940]   And we're hiring metaphysicians and people
[00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.300]   who are thinking about the nature of reality.
[00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.580]   And basically, what I've learned from them--
[00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:40.940]   - That's so great. - Yeah, they're very--
[00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.620]   - I'd love to attend those faculty talks.
[00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:43.580]   (both laughing)
[00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.260]   Metaphysics professors.
[00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.460]   - What's funny is that-- - That's so great.
[00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.300]   - For each one of them, I'm convinced each time.
[00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.620]   They all say different things, but they're so convincing.
[00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.980]   I'm like, "Yes, hire that one," right?
[00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.500]   - Is it like historical philosophy--
[00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.780]   - No, no. - Like a particular topic?
[00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:57.620]   - What they do-- - Do they have--
[00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:58.460]   - No, they're-- - Do they have
[00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:59.780]   an actual belief?
[00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.860]   They're practicing metaphysics--
[00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.460]   - Metaphysicians, yes. (Dave laughing)
[00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:04.900]   So, what they do is they come,
[00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.420]   and they're usually excellent philosophers
[00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:11.260]   from Harvard or USC or whatever.
[00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.720]   They come, and they give what's called a job talk.
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.900]   That's what philos, well, every academic does a job talk
[00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.540]   in order to get a, they talk to us about a department
[00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.920]   about what they do, and so it so happens
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.900]   that we need a metaphysician,
[00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.540]   and now we're hiring again for one.
[00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.740]   And so, I've learned a lot about metaphysics
[00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.560]   in the last year, and this is what I've learned,
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.620]   that they use physics as a basis for understanding
[00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.860]   what we can know about what is real,
[00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.020]   and what is real is really difficult to pin down.
[00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.860]   And so, your question is, what is belief?
[00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.620]   Well, belief, does it correspond to reality?
[00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.260]   That's the question I would ask.
[00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.860]   And first, we don't even know what is real.
[00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.060]   So, the table, they would say,
[00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.860]   how do we know that the table even exists?
[00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.540]   Well, how do we differentiate it from the floor,
[00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:59.360]   for example?
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.740]   So, these are the questions that philosophers are asking.
[00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.100]   No one else's, of course,
[00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.020]   but philosophers are asking these questions,
[00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.420]   and they have different answers for it.
[00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:08.780]   So, I would say that it's very difficult
[00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.760]   to know what is real, and in fact,
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.760]   what I do usually is I paraphrase my friend and colleague,
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.820]   Brother Guy Consolmagno.
[00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.620]   He's a Jesuit priest, he's also an astronomer,
[00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.180]   and he's the director of the Vatican Observatory.
[00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.660]   And so, he says this, he's a very smart person.
[00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:30.420]   He says, "Well, truth is a moving target."
[00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:34.980]   So, basically, to know what is real out there,
[00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:36.900]   like gravity or something like that,
[00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:38.860]   you've got to approximate it.
[00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:43.860]   And as human beings, we have senses to tell us what,
[00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:45.800]   at least so we don't get hurt,
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.600]   we're not gonna fall off a building or something like that.
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.280]   We have eyes to see and things like that.
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.720]   So, we can approximate what reality is,
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.240]   but we're never gonna get to it
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:58.560]   unless we develop better senses, okay?
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.520]   And I think that that is what we are in the process of doing.
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.400]   We're developing better senses.
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.440]   We have telescopes, we have microscopes,
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.700]   we have extensions of ourselves,
[00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:09.320]   which are now called technology,
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.720]   and we can get to a better understanding
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.720]   of what reality is and what the objective world is,
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.360]   and therefore, our beliefs can be honed.
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.640]   So, we can get better beliefs, more accurate beliefs,
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.600]   but can we get beliefs that actually correspond to reality?
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:28.780]   Not in any precise way, but in approximate ways.
[00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:32.080]   So, I hope that's not too big an answer to your question.
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.080]   - Well, do you think beliefs in themselves
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.400]   can become reality?
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.140]   I mean, so you've now adapted the,
[00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:41.900]   in this little bit of a conversation,
[00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:44.540]   adapted the metaphysician view of reality,
[00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:45.860]   which is the physics.
[00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:46.700]   - Yes.
[00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:48.900]   - But, you know, we humans kind of operate
[00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:51.780]   in the space of ideas, very much so.
[00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:54.180]   Like, we've kind of, in the collective intelligence
[00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:56.420]   of human beings, have come up with a set of ideas
[00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:59.820]   that persist in the minds of these many people,
[00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:02.220]   and they become quite strong and powerful.
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:05.560]   In terms of impact on our lives,
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:10.560]   they can have sometimes more impact than this table does,
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.040]   than the physics.
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.120]   - Yeah, I agree.
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.480]   - And in that sense, is there some sense
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:19.920]   in which our beliefs are reality,
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:22.360]   even if they're not connected to the physics?
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.080]   - Yes, even if they're not real, yeah.
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:26.640]   Even if, okay, so yes, absolutely.
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:31.080]   So, our beliefs are tremendously,
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:33.860]   they create social effects, absolutely.
[00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:38.280]   There was a belief that, I'm gonna use this example.
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:39.120]   - Uh-oh.
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.320]   - There was a belief back in the day,
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.140]   and we're talking about, when I say back in the day,
[00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:43.640]   I'm a historian, so I'm talking about like,
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.360]   a thousand years ago, right?
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.180]   That women had no souls, okay?
[00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:50.060]   So, look, I don't know if human beings have souls.
[00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:51.260]   I can tell you this, though,
[00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.320]   that if human beings have souls, probably animals do too.
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.460]   That's my own personal belief.
[00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:58.260]   That's not a professor belief there.
[00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:02.360]   But there was this belief among the Catholic magisterium,
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:05.440]   which runs Europe, that women had no souls,
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.400]   so they had to have this big meeting about it.
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:08.820]   Did women have souls?
[00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:13.360]   But that belief had consequences for women.
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:16.680]   I mean, women were treated and have been treated
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:18.760]   as if they didn't have souls.
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:19.600]   Okay, so there's--
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.040]   - And the soul was really the essence of the human being.
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.440]   - It was, it's called the animus, right?
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:28.060]   It's what is the essence of what is eternal,
[00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:30.060]   you know, when women weren't eternal.
[00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:31.580]   Here's another example, okay?
[00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:33.960]   This is an example from my own research.
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.060]   All right, so there in the Catholic tradition,
[00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:40.380]   there's this idea of purgatory, hell, and heaven.
[00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:42.420]   And these are three destinations
[00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:45.180]   that people can go to when they die.
[00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:48.260]   And if you're great, you go to heaven automatically,
[00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:49.580]   and you're considered a saint.
[00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:52.580]   If you're okay, you go to purgatory, right?
[00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:55.660]   And you suffer for a time and then get back into heaven.
[00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:57.540]   If you're terrible, you go to hell, right?
[00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:02.180]   Okay, well, there was a place that the Catholics determined,
[00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:04.740]   and this was a belief for a long time,
[00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:07.220]   like a thousand years or more,
[00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:09.340]   and it was called limbo, all right?
[00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:13.340]   And limbo comes from the Latin, limbus, and it means edge.
[00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:15.020]   And it was either on the edge of hell
[00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:16.600]   or on the edge of heaven.
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.520]   No one really could determine which it was.
[00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:19.360]   No historians are like,
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:22.140]   "Well, this person says it was on the edge of heaven."
[00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:24.540]   - Well, listen, this was a terrible,
[00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:26.180]   first of all, there is no limbo anymore.
[00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:30.300]   In 2007, Benedict, the then Pope,
[00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:33.020]   got rid of the idea that there was limbo, okay?
[00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:34.660]   So Catholics kind of went crazy
[00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:35.940]   'cause they didn't really know,
[00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:37.660]   they forgot that limbo existed,
[00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:38.900]   and they thought it was purgatory.
[00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:40.980]   And they said, "How could you get rid of purgatory?"
[00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:43.180]   But actually, he just got rid of this idea of limbo.
[00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:45.340]   - Oh, so that's a distinct thing from purgatory.
[00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:46.460]   - It was, it was like-- - And by the way,
[00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:48.340]   people should know they have a book on purgatory
[00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:50.100]   that came before--
[00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:52.860]   - American Cosmic, yes, I wrote a book on purgatory, yeah.
[00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:55.620]   - Anyway, so limbo is a distinct thing from purgatory?
[00:10:55.620 --> 00:11:00.580]   - Yeah, and the types of people who go to limbo
[00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:04.220]   happen to be virtuous pagans, okay?
[00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:06.220]   Like Socrates or somebody like that.
[00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:09.820]   And children who weren't baptized.
[00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:14.500]   So think of this, think of for like more than 1,000 years,
[00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:18.040]   mothers and fathers gave birth to babies
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:20.860]   who weren't baptized and couldn't be buried
[00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:23.300]   with their family in these burial,
[00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:26.340]   and then they couldn't be reunited with them in heaven.
[00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:28.660]   Think of the pain and suffering that that caused.
[00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:30.540]   And that was nothing.
[00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:32.100]   Limbo's nothing.
[00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:35.460]   Yet the belief in it caused untold suffering.
[00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:37.140]   And that's just a small example.
[00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:39.260]   - And that was as real to them--
[00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:40.780]   - It was absolutely real.
[00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:42.780]   I mean, the effects were real, let's put it that way.
[00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:44.780]   The place itself, not real.
[00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:46.020]   - But the families themselves,
[00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:47.740]   do you think they really believed it?
[00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:48.960]   - They totally believed it.
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:50.680]   - As much as the table is real?
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:53.000]   - Yes, I've read, but listen,
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.080]   we have trigger warnings today, right?
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:57.680]   So don't read this, it's gonna make you upset, okay?
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:01.560]   History, primary sources, no trigger warnings, okay?
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:06.440]   So you're going through like somebody's diary from 1400,
[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:09.080]   and you hear the suffering and pain that they went through.
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:10.540]   There were times in my research
[00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:14.400]   where I'd have to put my primary source down,
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.920]   and just basically go outside and take a walk,
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:18.400]   because it was so horrific.
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:20.960]   I knew it was true, because they wouldn't write something,
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:23.240]   you know, they're not gonna write in their diary
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:25.000]   something that's not true, and it was horrible.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.300]   So yes, these people went through untold suffering
[00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:31.000]   for nothing, because they had an erroneous belief.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.720]   But they didn't know it was erroneous.
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:33.920]   - So it was real to them.
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.160]   - Yeah.
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:38.020]   - So I don't know if you're familiar with Donald Hoffman.
[00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:41.120]   He has this idea that in terms of
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:46.520]   the distance we are from being able to know the reality,
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:48.840]   which is there, the physics reality,
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.640]   is we're actually really, really, really,
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:52.400]   really far away from that.
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:53.240]   - Yeah.
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:56.880]   - So like it's, I think his idea is that
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:00.000]   we're basically like completely detached from it.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   - Yes.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.020]   - What's your sense, how close are we to the reality?
[00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:08.920]   We'll talk about a bunch of ideas about our beliefs
[00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:11.340]   in technology and beyond,
[00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:16.240]   but in terms of what is actually real from a physical sense,
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:18.320]   how close are we to understanding that?
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:19.160]   - Pretty far.
[00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.760]   I'm gonna use examples from what I do.
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.520]   Okay, so this idea that
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:28.960]   we're suspicious of what we actually think is real
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:30.280]   is not new, of course.
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:33.560]   It goes back a long time, thousands of years, in fact.
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:37.400]   And philosophers, I'm not actually technically a philosopher,
[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:40.280]   but I was one. (laughs)
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:43.040]   I'm a professor of religious studies.
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:44.840]   - Yeah, but what do you introduce yourself at,
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:47.960]   like at a bar when the bartender asks, "What do you do?"
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.440]   - I never tell people what I do.
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:50.440]   (both laugh)
[00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:52.000]   Especially on airplanes.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.280]   - Yeah. - It's a bad idea.
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:54.120]   - Okay.
[00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:56.160]   - So generally if they push, though, I say,
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:57.820]   I'm the chair of philosophy and religion,
[00:13:57.820 --> 00:13:59.480]   although I stepped down last year,
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:00.840]   so I'm no longer the chair.
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:04.120]   But I have like a master's degree in philosophy,
[00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:06.000]   and I was a philosophy major, and I've studied,
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.540]   I still study philosophy,
[00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:09.400]   so I integrate it into my research.
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:14.360]   All right, so this idea that we can't know,
[00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:15.800]   we're suspicious of what we know,
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:18.320]   it's called external world skepticism.
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:20.760]   That's the official philosophical name for it.
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:23.280]   Our faculties and our senses
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:27.640]   don't give us accurate perceptions of what is there, okay?
[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:31.000]   Especially at a quantum level or a molecular level.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.480]   I mean, that's just obvious.
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:35.320]   So yeah, so I think that the person you mentioned
[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:36.600]   is correct in that.
[00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.440]   I think we're far away from it.
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.880]   - I think you're talking about our direct senses,
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:44.360]   but we have tools, measurement tools,
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:49.020]   from microscopes to all the tools of astronomy,
[00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:52.000]   cosmology, that gives us a sense of the big universe
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.800]   and also the sense of the very small.
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:57.600]   Do you think there's some other things
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:01.680]   that are completely sort of other dimensions,
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:05.200]   or there's ideas of panpsychism,
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.820]   that consciousness permeates all matter,
[00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:11.480]   there's like fundamental forces of physics
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:14.060]   we're not even aware of yet?
[00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:15.300]   - Oh, absolutely.
[00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:18.100]   I do think, and this is why I write about technology,
[00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:22.700]   and I mean, that's actually what I specialize in
[00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:25.980]   is belief in technology with respect to religion.
[00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:30.980]   So in my opinion, thank goodness for technology,
[00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:32.780]   because where would we be without it?
[00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:36.780]   I mean, frankly, I think that it's like Marshall McLuhan
[00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:38.920]   was the person who said,
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:42.260]   "Technology is like an extension of our senses."
[00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.420]   And I absolutely believe that to be true.
[00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:49.420]   I think that we're lucky that Prometheus gave us technology,
[00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:51.560]   and that we use it,
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:54.500]   and we're making it better and better and better and better,
[00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:57.300]   and that makes us more efficient.
[00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:59.400]   It makes us more efficient as a species.
[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:05.340]   And my point is that I think that our instruments
[00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:11.340]   I mean, I don't want to be a religious technologist,
[00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:16.460]   but our instruments will save us.
[00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:19.100]   I mean, they're already making life better for us.
[00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:21.040]   - You think it's important that they also help us
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:24.060]   understand reality more directly, more deeply?
[00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:26.500]   - I think directly is better than deeply.
[00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:29.140]   I think directly, more directly is probably
[00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:32.300]   a more accurate term for what you're trying to,
[00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:33.380]   I think, ask me.
[00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:34.500]   Can we actually, I mean,
[00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:36.140]   I think you're asking me that question
[00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:38.500]   that Kant basically was trying to get at,
[00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:40.640]   was can we know the thing in itself?
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:41.620]   Can we know that?
[00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:45.660]   Can we have some kind of intense knowing of it?
[00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:47.100]   It's almost mystical.
[00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:52.100]   And I would say that that's where religion comes in.
[00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:54.780]   Okay, that's where we talk about religion.
[00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:58.260]   And if I may also go back to Immanuel Kant,
[00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:01.820]   this idea that he, just before he died,
[00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:03.860]   just as he died, he was working on,
[00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:05.660]   he did this critique of reason
[00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:07.380]   where basically he believed,
[00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:12.380]   he basically talks about, can we know what's real?
[00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:14.420]   And he basically has this long,
[00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:15.980]   that question, can we know what's real?
[00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:19.780]   And then a thousand pages later, no.
[00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:21.220]   (both laughing)
[00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:22.860]   I'll just give you the rundown, okay?
[00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:23.980]   So, okay, no. - Spoiler alert.
[00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:25.540]   - Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:27.340]   Then he does this other critique.
[00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:29.820]   And okay, so he does like three critiques.
[00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:32.300]   Then he does this critique of judgment, okay?
[00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:34.580]   Well, judgment is this other thing altogether.
[00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:36.340]   And I think that that's what you're getting at.
[00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:37.980]   So how do we know things?
[00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:41.260]   How can we know things really intensely and intimately?
[00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.500]   And I think that he thought that judgment
[00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:48.500]   was the idea that we can actually know the thing in itself.
[00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:51.180]   And he was working on that as he died,
[00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:52.700]   and then he never finished it.
[00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:56.580]   Hannah Arendt, another philosopher of the 20th century,
[00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:59.420]   took it up, took up the critique of judgment
[00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:01.340]   and tried to finish it.
[00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:03.300]   - Oh, why the word judgment?
[00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:04.940]   - Because judgment, think about it.
[00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:09.180]   When you see a work of art, who judges that to be decent?
[00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:13.420]   Okay, so there is a group of people
[00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:16.620]   who come to the decision that that's rotten,
[00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:18.780]   or that's pretty good.
[00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:21.980]   You know, like I noticed that you like to play guitar.
[00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:25.100]   Well, you choose music that I happen to like too, okay?
[00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:29.140]   So you and I both have a sense of judgment, just a sense.
[00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:31.700]   So he said, there's a sense that some people have.
[00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:36.820]   Why do certain communities have a similar sense?
[00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:38.340]   What dictates that?
[00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:39.740]   And so he was working on that.
[00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:42.460]   He thought it had something to do with the knowledge,
[00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:45.340]   the intimate knowledge of the thing in itself.
[00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:48.340]   Yeah, so another philosopher
[00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:50.180]   that philosophers actually don't like at all,
[00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:53.300]   but religious studies people do, is Martin Heidegger.
[00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:55.980]   So Martin Heidegger has some great essays.
[00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:58.020]   One is called "What is a Work of Art?"
[00:18:58.020 --> 00:18:59.620]   And again, he gets to, you know,
[00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:02.020]   he talks about Van Gogh and Van Gogh's shoes.
[00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:05.020]   You know that picture, the painting Van Gogh's shoes.
[00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:07.820]   It's really a really intense picture.
[00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:09.460]   It's just shoes.
[00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:13.580]   It's, you know, it's an amazing painting of shoes.
[00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:15.460]   And I think everybody can agree,
[00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:18.660]   that's a cool picture of shoes, right?
[00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:19.820]   And so why?
[00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:20.660]   You know, the question is,
[00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:22.460]   why is that a cool picture of shoes?
[00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:25.660]   You know, what kind of knowledge are we accessing
[00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:28.980]   to determine that indeed that works, right?
[00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:30.660]   And in fact, we still like it.
[00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:32.900]   - So basically the nature of knowledge
[00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:34.500]   and what does it represent?
[00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:36.420]   It can operate in the space of,
[00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:37.860]   that's detached from reality,
[00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:41.620]   or can it ultimately represent reality?
[00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:45.420]   I guess that's the space of metaphysics?
[00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:46.500]   Is that the--
[00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:47.780]   - Yeah, so what can we know
[00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:49.380]   is actually called epistemology.
[00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:50.220]   - Epistemology.
[00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:51.340]   - But metaphysics is--
[00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:52.260]   - The intersect, I guess.
[00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:55.060]   - Is basically what is the nature of reality.
[00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:57.340]   - Right, and those intersect.
[00:19:57.340 --> 00:19:58.420]   - Absolutely, yeah.
[00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:00.140]   A lot of things intersect in philosophy.
[00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:02.340]   We just have fancy names for them.
[00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:05.580]   - Another non-philosopher
[00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:07.900]   that may be considered a philosopher,
[00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:09.260]   since we're talking about reality,
[00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:12.980]   is Ayn Rand and her philosophy of objectivism.
[00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:17.460]   What are your thoughts on her sense
[00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:20.500]   of taking this idea of reality,
[00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:22.820]   calling her philosophy objectivism,
[00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:26.020]   and kind of starting at the idea
[00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:30.140]   that you really could know everything,
[00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:32.380]   and it's pretty obvious,
[00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:35.380]   and then from that you can derive an ethics
[00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:37.380]   about how to live life,
[00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:40.780]   like what is the good ethical life
[00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:42.820]   and all the virtue of selfishness,
[00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:44.020]   all that kind of stuff.
[00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:47.420]   So you talked to a lot of academic philosophers,
[00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:50.460]   so I'd be curious to see from the perspective of like,
[00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:56.500]   is she somebody that's taken seriously at all?
[00:20:56.500 --> 00:21:02.020]   Why is she dismissed, as I see from my distant perspective,
[00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:04.140]   by serious philosophers?
[00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:06.700]   And also like your own personal thoughts of like,
[00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:08.060]   is there some interesting bits
[00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:12.380]   that you find inspiring in her work or not?
[00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:14.780]   - Okay, so Ayn Rand,
[00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:19.780]   I've had so many exceedingly intelligent students
[00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:24.180]   basically give me her books
[00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:28.060]   and basically say, "Please, Dr. Basilka, read this book."
[00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:30.500]   And I'll tell them, "Yes, thank you.
[00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:31.660]   "I've read this book before."
[00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:35.060]   And then when I engage in, let me put it this way,
[00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:37.700]   they're religious about Ayn Rand, okay?
[00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:42.700]   So to them, Ayn Rand represents some type of way of life,
[00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:44.780]   right, her objectivism.
[00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:48.340]   Now, why is she not taken seriously
[00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:50.220]   by philosophers in general?
[00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:51.060]   (laughs)
[00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:52.660]   Well, let me put it this way.
[00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:56.620]   Philosophers in general tend to get pretty,
[00:21:56.620 --> 00:22:02.220]   I guess you could call it they're kind of scientists,
[00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:03.220]   but with words.
[00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:04.620]   I always call philosophy,
[00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:06.180]   when I describe it to someone
[00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:07.340]   who's gonna take a philosophy class,
[00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:10.860]   I say it's basically math problems,
[00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:12.660]   like word math problems, okay?
[00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:14.020]   So that's basically what it is.
[00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:16.060]   - So they take words very seriously
[00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:16.900]   and they're very formal about it.
[00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:18.780]   - And definitions very seriously, yeah.
[00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:20.260]   So they all wanna get on the same page,
[00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:22.300]   so there is no confusion.
[00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:25.420]   So for Ayn Rand to basically say you can know everything
[00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:28.220]   and establish ethics from that,
[00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:31.060]   I think philosophers automatically say no.
[00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:33.340]   Now, that doesn't mean I say no.
[00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:36.860]   In fact, we have at my university,
[00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:38.700]   a wonderful business school.
[00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:42.140]   And when you walk into the Dean
[00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:45.620]   of the business school's office, Ayn Rand is everywhere.
[00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:47.460]   So it's (laughs)
[00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:51.340]   So I wanna say that not all academics are anti Ayn Rand.
[00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:54.620]   And in fact, I don't think philosophers are either,
[00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:57.740]   except that they don't teach Ayn Rand, okay?
[00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:00.140]   So in one sense, you could say that
[00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:01.300]   because they don't teach her,
[00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:03.900]   they're being exclusive in what they teach.
[00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:07.540]   Or very particular, perhaps, is another way to put it.
[00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:09.780]   - Yeah, it's hard to know where to place people like her,
[00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:14.220]   because do you put Albert Camus as a philosopher?
[00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:16.140]   So I guess what's the good term for that?
[00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:18.180]   Like literary philosophers?
[00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:20.980]   Or whatever the term is,
[00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:24.080]   it's annoying to me that the academic philosophers
[00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:26.100]   get to own the word philosophy,
[00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:29.580]   'cause it's just like people who think deeply about life
[00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:32.060]   is what I think about as philosophy.
[00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:34.500]   And to me, it's like, all right,
[00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:37.000]   so I know Nietzsche is another person
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.660]   that's probably not respected in the philosophy circles,
[00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:44.140]   because he is full of contradictions, full of--
[00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:45.140]   - I love Nietzsche.
[00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:45.980]   (Lex laughs)
[00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:47.460]   He's my favorite philosopher.
[00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:48.300]   - Oh, really?
[00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:49.620]   - Yes, I absolutely love Nietzsche.
[00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:50.860]   - So he's definitely, you know,
[00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:52.680]   I love people that are full of ideas,
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:54.360]   even if they're full of contradictions,
[00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:55.200]   and Nietzsche is certainly that.
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:56.020]   - Absolutely, yeah.
[00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:58.140]   - And Ayn Rand is also that.
[00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:02.180]   I'm able to look past the obvious ego
[00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:03.940]   that's there on the page,
[00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:07.280]   and the fact that she actually has, in my view,
[00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:09.300]   a lot of wrong ideas.
[00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:13.060]   But there's a lot of interesting tidbits to pick up,
[00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:15.420]   and the same goes with Nietzsche.
[00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:19.700]   And I'm weirded out by the religious aspect here,
[00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:22.740]   on both the people who worship Ayn Rand,
[00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:25.020]   and people who completely dismiss her.
[00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:26.420]   I just kind of see it as,
[00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:29.580]   oh, can we just read a few interesting things,
[00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:31.620]   and get inspired by it, and move on?
[00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:32.460]   As opposed to--
[00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:33.300]   - No.
[00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:35.020]   - Have a dogmatic, binary thing.
[00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:37.080]   Is there something you find about her work
[00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:38.700]   that's interesting to you,
[00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:41.940]   or her personality, or any of that?
[00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:44.020]   - Oh, I think she's fascinating.
[00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:45.620]   I don't dismiss her.
[00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:49.700]   She was a woman who reached a level of success
[00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:53.220]   with her mind at a time when that was difficult.
[00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:57.460]   So, I mean, she's definitely worth looking at,
[00:24:57.460 --> 00:24:58.940]   for even that reason.
[00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:01.900]   But also, her idea,
[00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:05.580]   I guess part of the situation with Rand,
[00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:08.660]   first of all, I think that her work is,
[00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:11.700]   you have to, it's misinterpreted, okay?
[00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:13.780]   And I think that's the same with Nietzsche.
[00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:15.540]   Like, a lot of people think that,
[00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:18.860]   I mean, in fact, it is the case that
[00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:22.060]   Nietzsche's writing before the 20th century,
[00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:24.840]   so he's got the, you know, he's somewhat,
[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:28.500]   his rhetoric is sexist and racist,
[00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:30.820]   and of the time period, right?
[00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:35.820]   He was a educated philosopher of that time period.
[00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:40.860]   However, his books are amazing,
[00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:44.900]   and Nietzsche's philosophy is incredible.
[00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:49.300]   And I think that's what you're saying about Rand, too.
[00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:50.140]   And I agree.
[00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:54.020]   I mean, I think that we get caught up,
[00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:56.300]   I mean, likely we should,
[00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:58.540]   and we should contextualize these thinkers
[00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:00.780]   in the time period within which they are.
[00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:02.500]   We should not forgive their,
[00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:04.740]   'cause there were people during Nietzsche's time
[00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:09.740]   that were feminist and not racist and things like that.
[00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:14.980]   And, you know, so, but each has merit.
[00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:17.500]   I mean, I would say Nietzsche is,
[00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:21.020]   you did ask me to talk about some of the books
[00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:23.260]   that made the largest impact on me,
[00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:25.340]   and Nietzsche's "Gay Science" is one of them.
[00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:28.860]   It's one of the best books ever, in my opinion.
[00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:30.160]   - I do think Nietzsche was,
[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:33.980]   I don't know about exactly sexist,
[00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:35.180]   he certainly was sexist,
[00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:40.140]   but it felt like he didn't get laid much in his life.
[00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:40.980]   - No.
[00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:43.540]   - It felt like he was extra sexist.
[00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:46.340]   I was like, his theories on women are like, all right.
[00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:47.500]   - He's pretty angry.
[00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:48.980]   - He seems frustrated.
[00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:49.820]   - Yeah.
[00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:50.660]   (laughing)
[00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:52.340]   - Like, all right, calm down, buddy.
[00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:54.860]   - The fate of philosophers.
[00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:58.380]   - I just ignore everything Nietzsche says about women.
[00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:04.060]   So can we talk about myth and religion a little bit?
[00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:04.900]   - Yes.
[00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:07.340]   - Can we start at the beginning, which is like,
[00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:10.780]   myths, how are they born?
[00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:13.780]   There's this collective intelligence amongst us human beings
[00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:17.100]   and we seem to create these beautiful ideas
[00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:19.540]   that captivate the minds of millions.
[00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:21.580]   How is such a myth born?
[00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:22.700]   - Great question.
[00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:26.060]   Okay, so that brings us to terminology again.
[00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:31.060]   And in my field, we definitely, I think,
[00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:34.020]   try not to distinguish between religion.
[00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:36.500]   This is gonna be controversial, I think,
[00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:37.900]   between religion and myth,
[00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:42.900]   because we call other cultures, religions, myths, right?
[00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:46.740]   And then we call our myths, religions.
[00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:49.140]   - And I guess myth has a bad connotation to it,
[00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:50.700]   that it's not somehow real.
[00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:51.540]   - Yeah.
[00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:54.660]   Now, what's interesting is that people like Plato,
[00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:58.180]   who lived thousands of years ago, 2,500 about,
[00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:01.460]   basically made this distinction himself
[00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:05.180]   within his own culture, which was Greek, right?
[00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:08.020]   So Plato's a very famous Greek philosopher.
[00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:09.700]   And he would say things like this.
[00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:13.620]   He would say that, he would make a distinction
[00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:18.060]   between the reality of the one God or the one.
[00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:21.060]   He would call it, he didn't use the word God,
[00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:24.540]   but he's referencing a divinity, okay?
[00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:27.100]   And he believes in the soul, okay?
[00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:31.020]   So, but he would also say that the gods and goddesses
[00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:33.180]   of the Greeks are just myths.
[00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:35.180]   So even he would make that distinction.
[00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:39.460]   Again, he would say the population is not too bright,
[00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:42.140]   so they believe in these gods and goddesses.
[00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:44.940]   But he himself is talking to his students,
[00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:48.580]   and he's basically talking about forms,
[00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:52.700]   so that live in, seem to live in these other dimensions.
[00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:54.300]   Like this table, let's go back to this table
[00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:57.060]   that we're talking around right now.
[00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:59.620]   He would say that this table is the instantiation
[00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:02.060]   of the form table, and that there's this table
[00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:03.740]   that actually exists somewhere.
[00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:05.700]   It's where this place where numbers exist,
[00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:07.300]   like the number two, okay?
[00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:09.820]   So there, we use the number two mathematically,
[00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:11.260]   therefore it exists.
[00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:13.220]   But have you ever seen a real one?
[00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:14.860]   Have you ever seen the real two?
[00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:15.820]   No. - No.
[00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:17.500]   - Okay, so, but where does it exist?
[00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:18.780]   So he says that tables,
[00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:20.940]   so he was also talking about things that,
[00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:27.340]   he says are real, making a distinction between the people.
[00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:31.660]   And by the way, he got this from Socrates, his mentor,
[00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:35.060]   who was killed by Athens because he would say such things.
[00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:36.900]   People don't like to be told that they,
[00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:38.780]   what they believe in is not real, right?
[00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:42.220]   - Yeah, by the way, his idea of forms is just,
[00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:45.060]   you're just making me realize how incredible was that
[00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:47.580]   somebody like that was able to come up with that.
[00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:49.500]   I mean, that idea became a myth,
[00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:53.300]   the idea of forms, right, that permeated
[00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:57.140]   probably the most influential set of ideas
[00:29:57.140 --> 00:30:00.500]   in the history of philosophy, in the history of ideas.
[00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:03.620]   - Yes, yeah, I mean, Plato, we know him for a reason, right?
[00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:07.140]   - Yeah, so let's say that we're not,
[00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:09.260]   it's a gray area between religious and myth,
[00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:11.500]   and maybe not even-- - It is gray, yeah.
[00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:16.260]   - So how's that idea with like little Plato start
[00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:18.780]   and permeate the role of society?
[00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:19.700]   - Oh, how does it happen?
[00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:23.100]   Okay, so there are different ways that religions work.
[00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:26.340]   So a lot of people would call the UFO narrative today,
[00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:29.900]   like, and this is what I talk about in my book,
[00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:31.860]   like a myth, right, the UFO myth,
[00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:33.980]   but a lot of people believe in it, okay?
[00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:35.580]   So how do these things work?
[00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:37.100]   Well, what I did was I took,
[00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:42.580]   there's a, Ann Taves at UC Santa Barbara,
[00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:46.020]   she's a pretty well-known academic who studies religion,
[00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:49.140]   and she has this building block definition of religion,
[00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:50.460]   like it builds, okay?
[00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:55.140]   And so she says, "There are no religious experiences
[00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:59.100]   "or mythic experiences, there are experiences,
[00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:03.100]   "and then they get interpreted as religious or mythic,"
[00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:08.100]   okay, and so I use that with the UFO narrative.
[00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:12.300]   So I take, and I compare it to the religious narrative.
[00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:15.980]   So basically what happens, what happens is this,
[00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:20.740]   is that a person generally has a very intense experience,
[00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:23.060]   it could be with something that they see in the sky,
[00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:25.140]   a being that they see,
[00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:28.460]   like Moses in the burning bush or something like that.
[00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:30.260]   They tell other people, okay,
[00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:33.300]   and those other people believe them because they say,
[00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:35.640]   "That guy, let's take you, okay, Alex,
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:39.220]   "okay, so you're playing some of your music,
[00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:41.480]   "Jimmy Hendrix shows up out of the blue."
[00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:44.900]   So Jimmy Hendrix, who does electric church stuff, right,
[00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:47.660]   the electric church movement, so he shows up.
[00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:50.220]   - I was, sorry, for a small attention,
[00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:53.700]   I'm not aware of, I apologize if I should be,
[00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:56.500]   I just know how to play all of the songs.
[00:31:56.500 --> 00:32:00.300]   Electric church, is this a thing?
[00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:03.540]   - Oh yeah, yeah, it's Jimmy Hendrix's thing, yeah.
[00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:05.740]   - That was like a philosophy of his or what?
[00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:07.660]   - Yes, yes, yes, so he thought,
[00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:11.060]   it was like a mission for him, like he was a missionary,
[00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:13.500]   and he was doing the electric church.
[00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:16.260]   It was through his mission of music
[00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:18.700]   that he was actually impacting people spiritually,
[00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:20.100]   and I think you have to agree
[00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:21.980]   that his music is really spiritual, yeah.
[00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:23.120]   - Wow, that's so cool to know
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:24.820]   that there's like a philosophy there.
[00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:25.660]   - Yeah.
[00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:27.180]   - I wonder if he's ever written anything.
[00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:29.020]   - He's spoken about it many times.
[00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:29.860]   - Interesting.
[00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:30.700]   - Yeah.
[00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:32.020]   - I need to actually do some research here.
[00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:34.700]   Wow, that adds another level of depth, that's awesome.
[00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:35.860]   Okay, so.
[00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:40.500]   - Okay, so say Lex is playing one of his songs.
[00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:41.460]   He shows up.
[00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:43.500]   - What's your favorite Hendrix song by the way?
[00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:46.060]   - Oh, that's a hard one, I like "Castles in the Sand."
[00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:48.700]   It's a sad one, but I like it.
[00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:50.940]   - So I'm playing something, and they show up.
[00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:51.900]   - And all of a sudden, boom,
[00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:56.420]   just like Elvis does for people, Hendrix shows up, all right?
[00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:59.300]   And then you're amazed, and he tells you something
[00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:01.100]   that's very, very significant,
[00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:03.460]   and he says, "You need to tell other people this, okay?"
[00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:04.700]   So then like, okay.
[00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:06.260]   - I go on social media.
[00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:09.820]   - Yes, and you start, and because people believe you,
[00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:14.380]   and because you are a person of credibility,
[00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:15.420]   people believe you.
[00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:17.820]   And so all of a sudden a movement starts, okay?
[00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:19.380]   And it's the Hendrix movement.
[00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:21.300]   It's Hendrix 2, or something like that.
[00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:22.900]   You know, we call it something,
[00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:25.220]   the next iteration of Hendrix, right?
[00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:28.300]   Hendrix lives, but he lives as this vibration,
[00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:30.660]   and only Lex can like, you know,
[00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:32.980]   can manifest this vibration, okay?
[00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:36.620]   So like, this is how religions start, you know,
[00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:37.940]   excuse your audience who are religious,
[00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:39.260]   I'm actually practicing Catholic,
[00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:41.060]   so this is how religions start.
[00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:44.460]   They start with, first off, a contact experience.
[00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:47.540]   Not all of them, but a good portion of them.
[00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:51.420]   Some person has an experience that's transcendent,
[00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:54.540]   sacred to them, and they go and they tell other people.
[00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:56.900]   And then those people tell other people.
[00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:59.460]   And then something gets written about it, okay?
[00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:02.260]   And then it becomes, because it's a charismatic movement,
[00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:04.460]   people become affected by it.
[00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:07.540]   And if too many people are affected by it,
[00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:11.860]   an institution steps in and tries to control the narrative.
[00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:15.620]   So this is what you'd call the beginning of a religion,
[00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:17.700]   or a myth, a very powerful myth.
[00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:20.180]   And so it's almost like a star, right?
[00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:22.100]   A star is born, okay? - A star is born.
[00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:23.900]   When you say institution, do you mean
[00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:27.020]   some other organization that's already powerful?
[00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:28.820]   - Yes. - That doesn't want to become
[00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:30.660]   overpowered by this new movement?
[00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:31.500]   - Yes, absolutely.
[00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:32.780]   - Is this usually governments?
[00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:33.740]   - It's usually, yeah.
[00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:35.860]   So I have a couple examples.
[00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:38.740]   I use the example of the Christian church in my book,
[00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:41.500]   'cause I'm most familiar with the history of Christianity.
[00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:46.260]   And Christianity was started by this Jewish man,
[00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:48.940]   and it was a movement that,
[00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:51.660]   he was a very powerful, charismatic person.
[00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:53.340]   Other people believed in him,
[00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:55.300]   and then his followers talked about him.
[00:34:55.300 --> 00:35:01.740]   Usually early Christians before the 300s
[00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:05.540]   were generally people who were disenfranchised,
[00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:07.540]   because he had a pretty radical idea
[00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:10.460]   that humans should have dignity.
[00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:12.740]   And this was pretty radical during that time.
[00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:14.940]   So women who didn't have dignity,
[00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:17.860]   and slaves who didn't have dignity at the time,
[00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:20.900]   converged to Christianity and drove.
[00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:23.740]   And so what happened was that all of a sudden
[00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:27.820]   it became this belief system that was undercurrent.
[00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:31.500]   And then Constantine, who was an elite,
[00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:37.540]   had an experience and made Christianity to state religion.
[00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:40.260]   By that time, there were different forms of Christianity,
[00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:43.260]   probably hundreds of them, well, most likely.
[00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:48.260]   And Constantine and the people who were powerful with him
[00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:51.260]   decided that their idea,
[00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:53.100]   this is the Council of Nicaea now,
[00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:55.260]   decided that there was one form,
[00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:56.820]   and they called it universal,
[00:35:56.820 --> 00:36:00.140]   the one form of Christianity, and this should be it.
[00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:03.900]   And so they kind of took out all the other denominations
[00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:05.820]   of Christianity and different forms of it.
[00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:09.900]   So you can see that a very, very powerful set
[00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:14.900]   of beliefs put a culture on fire, right?
[00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:16.620]   And so how did they,
[00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:19.100]   they had to deal with that fire somehow.
[00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:20.740]   And so they narrativized it.
[00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:23.140]   They decided, how do we interpret this?
[00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:25.420]   And they interpreted it as they wished,
[00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:28.180]   but that wasn't the only interpretation of Christianity.
[00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:29.660]   I have another example.
[00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:32.060]   I'm in a Catholic church.
[00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:37.060]   A lot of times, and I'm gonna use the example of Faustina.
[00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:41.820]   She's a nun and she's Polish.
[00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:44.820]   And I think it was in the early 20th century,
[00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:48.260]   if not the 1800s, that she had a very powerful,
[00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:52.380]   many experiences actually of Jesus.
[00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:57.140]   And she saw Jesus with rays coming out of his heart.
[00:36:57.140 --> 00:37:00.140]   And basically she called this his divine mercy,
[00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:04.420]   and it became a devotion in Poland and it spread.
[00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:07.780]   The Catholic church was not into this at all, okay?
[00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:09.460]   And so they did everything they could
[00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:12.820]   to try to suppress Faustina's influence,
[00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:16.620]   which was growing and growing and growing and growing, okay?
[00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:18.420]   And so they were very successful
[00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:21.460]   in trying to keep her quiet and she died, okay?
[00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:24.980]   Years later, John Paul II, Polish,
[00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:29.500]   sainted her and created the divine mercy devotion,
[00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:33.060]   which is worldwide now, and millions and millions of people.
[00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:36.220]   But do you see how they completely controlled it?
[00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:40.300]   - It's so fascinating that it just starts with a single,
[00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:42.260]   so like you said, contact experience,
[00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:43.660]   experience is the key word.
[00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:48.660]   Is your sense that those experiences are legitimate?
[00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:52.780]   So it's not somehow artificially constructed?
[00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:54.060]   - Yeah, I think for the most part,
[00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:56.300]   they're legitimate experiences that people have.
[00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:57.780]   Why would someone wanna put themselves
[00:37:57.780 --> 00:37:59.260]   through what they go through?
[00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:01.020]   Why would Jesus wanna get crucified?
[00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:03.180]   I mean, that's a pretty nasty way to die.
[00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:07.340]   Why would Faustina bring this upon herself?
[00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:11.220]   The people that I meet who said that they've seen UFOs,
[00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:13.140]   that most of them don't wanna be known
[00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:15.500]   because of the ridicule that goes along with it.
[00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:18.220]   So I honestly think that there are people
[00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:22.220]   who are maybe not stable and would like the attention,
[00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:23.460]   but for the most part,
[00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:25.620]   normal people don't want this attention.
[00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:27.380]   - So you mentioned building blocks.
[00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:30.620]   You did mention the word God,
[00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:34.100]   or sort of the afterlife.
[00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:36.740]   Are those essential to the myth?
[00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:38.660]   So there's a contact experience.
[00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:42.380]   Is there some other aspects of myth and religion
[00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:43.900]   which makes them viral,
[00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:46.860]   which makes them spread and captivate
[00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:50.100]   the imagination of people?
[00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:54.300]   - Yes, is there a pattern to them?
[00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:56.820]   I think that for each era, it's different.
[00:38:56.820 --> 00:38:58.500]   And people have, first, let's talk about
[00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:00.260]   the definition of religion, if that's okay,
[00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:03.660]   because most people assume the definitions
[00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:06.540]   that we in the West are familiar with,
[00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:11.540]   which is that of Christianity, Islam, Judaism,
[00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:13.100]   monotheistic religions.
[00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:15.860]   And there are, that's not,
[00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:17.940]   I mean, those are just some religions.
[00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:19.620]   There are so many different types of religions.
[00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:21.500]   Some religions have no God at all.
[00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:24.940]   Zen Buddhism, for example, is a religion
[00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:29.220]   that asks you to take away your belief structures,
[00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:31.580]   to kind of like, in fact, I would call that
[00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:33.620]   a Kantian-type religion, right?
[00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:35.220]   In that it's basically telling you
[00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:39.500]   to get rid of your concepts of what you think about things
[00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:41.940]   so that you can actually have the experience,
[00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:43.420]   like you were talking about earlier,
[00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:44.860]   of the thing in itself.
[00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:46.620]   And they call that satori.
[00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:49.020]   So there are people who believe,
[00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:52.820]   they try to, they call it meditation, Zen meditation.
[00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:56.700]   And it's fairly radical, actually.
[00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:59.860]   And some monasteries, I don't know if they still do this,
[00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:02.060]   but they'll whack you on the head
[00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:07.060]   if you appear to be not focusing and that kind of thing.
[00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:11.900]   They do things to basically take you away
[00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:13.740]   from your conceptions of reality
[00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:17.740]   and bring you into a state of all that is,
[00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:19.700]   which is what they call satori.
[00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:21.620]   And that has nothing to do with God.
[00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:23.860]   - I like this religion.
[00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:26.540]   And anything that involves sticks and whacking
[00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:28.780]   in order for you to focus better,
[00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:30.180]   I'm gonna have to join a monastery.
[00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:35.020]   So, okay, so digging into definitions of religion.
[00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:40.020]   So what do you think is the scope that defines a religion?
[00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:43.220]   - Oh, okay, so in my field,
[00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:46.020]   we have a few different definitions of religion,
[00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:47.580]   as you can imagine, just like philosophers
[00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:50.500]   have different definitions of what is real.
[00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:52.540]   So I take this definition,
[00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:54.100]   and it comes from John Livingston,
[00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:58.340]   and it's, "Religion is that set of beliefs and practices
[00:40:58.340 --> 00:41:03.500]   that is inspired by a transformative,
[00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:06.620]   what is perceived actually to be a transformative
[00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:08.780]   and sacred power."
[00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:09.620]   - Can you say that again?
[00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:13.420]   - Yeah, so religion is a set of, it's not just belief,
[00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:15.660]   it's also practices, it's both belief and practices,
[00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:18.300]   'cause you won't have the practices without the belief.
[00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:20.380]   So you have those together, okay?
[00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:23.340]   And it's inspired by what is perceived,
[00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:25.100]   because we don't know if it's real or not,
[00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:29.060]   what is perceived to be of sacred and transforming power.
[00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:31.100]   - So perceived by the followers?
[00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:32.020]   - Yeah. - Or is this connected
[00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:33.700]   to the original sort of experience?
[00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:36.820]   - No, no, well, it's perceived by the followers.
[00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:37.980]   - That's a really good definition.
[00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:41.860]   So, and that's the governing idea,
[00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:45.060]   is that there's something of great power.
[00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:46.260]   - Yes. - Perceived to be
[00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:50.260]   of great power, which you can connect yourself
[00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:53.180]   either emotionally or intellectually somehow,
[00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:54.660]   in order to explore the world
[00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:56.940]   that is beyond your own capabilities.
[00:41:56.940 --> 00:41:58.100]   - Yes.
[00:41:58.100 --> 00:42:00.620]   - And is there communication also involved?
[00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:01.940]   - Generally. - Yeah.
[00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:02.900]   - Yeah.
[00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:04.300]   - That's a great definition, okay.
[00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:08.180]   So within that falls everything that we've talked about
[00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:13.180]   so far, including technology and alien life and so on.
[00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:16.180]   Do you think ultimately religion
[00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:21.580]   is good for human civilization?
[00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:24.340]   Let me maybe phrase it differently,
[00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:28.060]   is what's religion good for?
[00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:30.220]   - Okay, yeah, that's a great question.
[00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:31.380]   Thanks for asking that.
[00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:32.740]   Most people don't ask that.
[00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:35.620]   And I think it's the question to ask.
[00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:37.660]   Why do we still have religion?
[00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:38.820]   That's the question, right?
[00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:42.740]   Because scientists and others, scholars,
[00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:48.260]   humanists even, thought that there's this thing
[00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:50.900]   called the secularization thesis,
[00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:55.620]   and it's this idea that the more we progress rationally
[00:42:55.620 --> 00:42:58.380]   and we have better instruments for understanding
[00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:00.860]   our reality, the less religious we will be.
[00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:03.140]   But that's been found to be untrue.
[00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:04.780]   We're still very religious, okay?
[00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:06.420]   So why, why is it around?
[00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:09.380]   Well, it's adaptive in some way, in my opinion.
[00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:11.540]   Many people would not agree with me,
[00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:15.100]   but I kind of see it as an evolutionary adaptation.
[00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:16.980]   Now, think about religions, okay?
[00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:20.300]   Think about Christianity again, for one.
[00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:23.580]   Here comes this idea when you have this ruthless empire
[00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:27.820]   called the Roman Empire, which litters its roads
[00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:31.180]   with crucified bodies to let you know,
[00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:33.260]   don't mess with us, okay?
[00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:35.900]   All right, here all of a sudden you have this guy saying,
[00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:37.940]   God is love, okay?
[00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:39.540]   All right, well, that's weird.
[00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:40.780]   Okay, so why?
[00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:42.020]   Why does this take off?
[00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:47.020]   Well, it takes off because we're becoming a colonial power.
[00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:50.820]   That means we're going into other countries,
[00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:52.420]   we're conquering them.
[00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:56.740]   We are, you know, how do we survive together
[00:43:56.740 --> 00:44:00.220]   as cultures that don't clash?
[00:44:00.220 --> 00:44:02.060]   Well, we have to have a belief structure
[00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:04.100]   that allows us to, and I think religions
[00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:05.740]   function that way, frankly.
[00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:10.740]   - So religions help us, from Richard Dawkins' meme idea,
[00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:15.240]   it allows us to explore a space of ideas,
[00:44:16.660 --> 00:44:21.660]   and that in itself is the, so it's like evolution of ideas.
[00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:25.380]   And religion is a powerful tool for us to explore ideas.
[00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:29.800]   - Because, you know, if I believe that men have souls.
[00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:32.580]   - Do they?
[00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:33.660]   - Yes, they do, okay.
[00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:41.020]   - I'm still trying to figure that out.
[00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:42.620]   Well, I still, in terms of souls,
[00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:44.460]   do believe cats don't have souls,
[00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:49.460]   but we'll never be able to confirm that.
[00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:51.500]   - Maybe if we get better instruments,
[00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:52.820]   you know, the soul instrument,
[00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:54.860]   you need to come up with that one, please.
[00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:55.700]   - For cats?
[00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:57.000]   - Yeah, not just for cats,
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.340]   but for all animals and people in general.
[00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:00.180]   - For sure.
[00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:01.980]   - You could put them in like a little, you know,
[00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:05.800]   soul machine and find out what's the status of their soul.
[00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:08.340]   - That's funny.
[00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:11.860]   I hope we'll become a scientific discipline of consciousness
[00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:14.260]   and consciousness is in some sense connected
[00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:19.020]   to maybe what the meaning of the word soul used to be.
[00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:21.800]   And I think it's a fascinating open question,
[00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:23.620]   like what is consciousness and so on,
[00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:26.940]   maybe we'll touch on in a little bit.
[00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:28.860]   But yeah, anyway, back to our--
[00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:30.380]   - Religions being adaptive.
[00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:32.620]   I think that Christianity probably helped us
[00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:37.220]   become better people to each other
[00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:40.420]   as we moved into a more global society.
[00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:42.720]   And also, it goes along with my book,
[00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:44.380]   which is basically making the argument
[00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:47.540]   that belief in non-human intelligence,
[00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:50.640]   or ETs, or UFOs, UAPs, whatever you wanna call them,
[00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:52.900]   is a new form of religion.
[00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:57.900]   - And how does that work with the scientific method?
[00:45:57.900 --> 00:46:01.300]   Do you think there's always this role of religion
[00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:03.860]   as being, in its broad definition of religion,
[00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:08.140]   as being a complement to our sort of very rigorous,
[00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:10.420]   empirical pursuit of understanding reality?
[00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:12.800]   Or there's always going to be this coupling?
[00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:16.540]   We'll always redefine new eras of civilization
[00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:20.520]   of what that religion actually looks like?
[00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:22.320]   So you talk about technology and so on
[00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:26.460]   being the modern set of religious beliefs around that.
[00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:33.200]   Is religion always going to kinda cover the space of things
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:35.860]   we can't quite understand with science yet,
[00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:38.240]   but we still wanna be thinking about?
[00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:40.560]   - Oh, I see what you're saying, that's a great question.
[00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:45.120]   When you say religion, I would use the word religiosity,
[00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:47.080]   because I think that we're moving out
[00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:50.640]   of the dogmatic types of religions into more of a,
[00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:53.080]   I hate to put it this way, but an X-Files type religion,
[00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:55.420]   where we can say, I want to believe,
[00:46:55.420 --> 00:46:57.400]   or the truth is out there.
[00:46:57.400 --> 00:46:58.920]   But we don't know that it's out there,
[00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:02.560]   or we don't know yet what it is, but we know it's out there.
[00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:07.560]   So there's this kind of built-in capacity for belief
[00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:10.760]   and something that we don't have evidence for yet,
[00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:12.280]   and that's a sort of faith.
[00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:15.760]   So I would say yes to that question, absolutely.
[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:17.360]   I think it's adaptive in that way.
[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:19.440]   We're moving into a new, I mean, heck,
[00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:21.200]   we've already moved into this culture.
[00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:23.440]   Most people have not caught up with it yet.
[00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:25.520]   I see that in the school systems,
[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:30.520]   and I think that I'm hoping we can catch up fast,
[00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:34.480]   'cause really it's moving faster than we are.
[00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:35.920]   - So I mentioned to you offline
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:40.840]   that I'm finishing up on the rise and fall
[00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:41.960]   of the Third Reich.
[00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:45.700]   I'm not sure if you have anything in your exploration,
[00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:50.200]   interesting to say, but the use of religion by dictators
[00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:53.720]   or the lack of the use of religion by dictators,
[00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:55.440]   whether we're talking about Stalin,
[00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:57.840]   which is mostly a secular,
[00:47:57.840 --> 00:48:00.200]   I apologize if I'm historically incorrect on this,
[00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:02.400]   but I believe it's a secular,
[00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:06.480]   and Hitler, I think there's some controversy
[00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:09.680]   about how much religion played a role
[00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:12.580]   in his own personal life and in general,
[00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:17.340]   in terms of influencing the,
[00:48:17.340 --> 00:48:22.160]   using it to manipulate the public,
[00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:25.080]   but definitely the church played a role.
[00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:27.960]   Do you have a sense of the use of religion
[00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:31.520]   by governments to control the populations
[00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:33.400]   by dictators, for example,
[00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:37.840]   or is that outside of your little explorations
[00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:39.960]   as a religious scholar?
[00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:43.660]   - It's not outside of my framework, absolutely not.
[00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:47.080]   I think that it's done routinely.
[00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:50.440]   Propaganda is done routinely,
[00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:53.880]   especially there's nothing more powerful than religion
[00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:56.680]   to get people to act, I think.
[00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:04.640]   My mother's Jewish and my father was Roman Catholic,
[00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:06.960]   from Irish extraction.
[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:10.720]   And so both members,
[00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:14.140]   both great-grandparents came here under duress
[00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:17.500]   because they were being, what would you call it?
[00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:21.040]   There was an act of genocide on both sides,
[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:22.560]   being done by other cultures.
[00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:26.240]   So on the one hand, obviously we know about the Holocaust.
[00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:28.240]   So they came, the great-grandparents came here
[00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:31.160]   to avoid that and they made it.
[00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:36.160]   On the other hand, there was an English genocide,
[00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:39.040]   we just have to say it, of the Irish.
[00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:41.440]   It was called a famine, but it wasn't one.
[00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:43.320]   It was a staged thing.
[00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:48.320]   And so millions of Irish left Ireland on coffin ships
[00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:49.480]   is what they called them,
[00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:51.280]   because they usually wouldn't get here.
[00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:52.680]   Mine happened to get here.
[00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:55.800]   Okay, so that's the context that I'm coming from.
[00:49:55.800 --> 00:50:00.280]   So in each case, for one thing, Irish weren't considered,
[00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:03.880]   there was, Catholics weren't considered,
[00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:05.560]   they were considered to be terrible.
[00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:08.000]   And there was a lot of anti-Catholic rhetoric
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.840]   here in the United States, which is kind of strange
[00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:13.760]   'cause one of the, in fact, the most wealthy
[00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:16.360]   colonial family were the Carrolls in Maryland
[00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:17.520]   and they were Catholic.
[00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:20.600]   So when you look at the United States, at our history,
[00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:22.880]   and you see the separation of church and state,
[00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:24.520]   do you wanna know where that came from?
[00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:26.280]   That came from those guys.
[00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:31.160]   They convinced George Washington and Thomas Jefferson.
[00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:34.440]   I mean, they couldn't vote, yet they had,
[00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:37.600]   they have their names on the constitution.
[00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:39.600]   Is that not a strange contradiction?
[00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:40.520]   (laughs)
[00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:44.560]   So here you can see how propaganda works.
[00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:46.960]   There was anti-Catholic propaganda,
[00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:49.880]   there was anti-Jewish propaganda,
[00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:54.320]   and a lot of it was that these people weren't human.
[00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:55.680]   They weren't human beings.
[00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:58.880]   Another thing I'd like to say is that
[00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:02.480]   when the Irish did come here, they were indentured,
[00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:07.480]   a lot of times indentured servants, but that's terminology.
[00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:09.760]   Then what is an indentured servant?
[00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:12.000]   - Slave.
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:12.840]   - Pretty much.
[00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:18.320]   - So in that sense, religion can be used--
[00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:19.320]   - Derogatorily.
[00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:22.440]   - Yeah, derogatorily as a useful grouping mechanism
[00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:24.440]   of saying this is the other.
[00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:29.080]   - And it's powerful too, because behind it is a force of,
[00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:33.080]   what people contend to be sacred, a sacred force, right?
[00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:37.880]   So it's up to God to decide who's,
[00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:40.320]   so you have to go along with what God says, of course.
[00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:44.800]   Well, that's basically, that's not the contact event.
[00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:47.760]   The contact event is usually some type of
[00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:51.640]   very specific, legitimate event that a person has
[00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:56.080]   with something that is non-human or considered divine.
[00:51:56.080 --> 00:52:01.080]   But when religions become narrativized,
[00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:04.320]   I would call it, by different institutions,
[00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:07.640]   that's when you're in danger of getting propaganda.
[00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:10.400]   - You said Nietzsche, one of your favorite philosophers,
[00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:14.320]   he said famously, one of the many famous things he said
[00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:16.680]   is that God is dead.
[00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:17.520]   - Yes.
[00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:19.840]   - What do you think he meant?
[00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:21.140]   Do you think he was right?
[00:52:21.900 --> 00:52:23.340]   - Okay, good, I love this question.
[00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:25.020]   No one asks me about Nietzsche.
[00:52:25.020 --> 00:52:27.500]   (both laughing)
[00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:28.620]   And I love Nietzsche.
[00:52:28.620 --> 00:52:31.660]   Okay, so first, actually, I do think,
[00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:32.700]   and I could be corrected
[00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:35.460]   and probably will be in all the comments.
[00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:36.820]   Well, first, Nietzsche, it's true,
[00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:38.420]   wasn't the first to say God is dead.
[00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:40.220]   I think Hegel said it, okay?
[00:52:40.220 --> 00:52:41.340]   No one reads Hegel.
[00:52:41.340 --> 00:52:44.380]   He's like so difficult to read that it's impossible.
[00:52:44.380 --> 00:52:45.820]   - Same with Heidegger, as you mentioned.
[00:52:45.820 --> 00:52:49.100]   - Yeah, I love him, but yeah, he's really hard to read.
[00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:51.180]   So Nietzsche basically said God is dead.
[00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:53.580]   And let me give you the context for him saying that.
[00:52:53.580 --> 00:52:54.700]   He also said this.
[00:52:54.700 --> 00:52:56.420]   He said there was only one Christian.
[00:52:56.420 --> 00:52:58.860]   He died on the cross, okay?
[00:52:58.860 --> 00:53:03.860]   So he despised Christianity, and he said that--
[00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:05.500]   - And the people who practice it.
[00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:08.100]   - Absolutely, yeah, but again, he believed in Jesus,
[00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:09.420]   and he believed Jesus was,
[00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:11.140]   he didn't believe he was a divinity,
[00:53:11.140 --> 00:53:14.220]   believed Jesus was a good man, and he died on the cross.
[00:53:14.220 --> 00:53:15.060]   Okay.
[00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:16.180]   - So he believed in the morality--
[00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:19.020]   - Yeah, he absolutely did, yeah, he did.
[00:53:19.020 --> 00:53:22.420]   And Nietzsche basically was making a historical statement
[00:53:22.420 --> 00:53:23.660]   about God is dead.
[00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:25.540]   He said, and he was right.
[00:53:25.540 --> 00:53:27.940]   He was basically saying that in the century in which
[00:53:27.940 --> 00:53:31.940]   he lived, and he died, I think, in 1900.
[00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:34.220]   Again, I could be wrong about that,
[00:53:34.220 --> 00:53:35.140]   so I just wanna say that.
[00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:36.980]   I believe he died in 1900.
[00:53:36.980 --> 00:53:39.700]   Okay, so he's writing in the 1800s,
[00:53:39.700 --> 00:53:43.980]   and he's basically saying God is dead, and we killed Him.
[00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:46.100]   Okay, so he's making a historical statement
[00:53:46.100 --> 00:53:49.700]   that at that point in time, with science just kind of
[00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:53.820]   getting better and industrialization happening,
[00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:58.820]   the idea of this thing beyond what we know
[00:53:58.820 --> 00:54:05.100]   as material reality is dead.
[00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:10.100]   So the substrate of Western civilization is dead.
[00:54:10.100 --> 00:54:13.700]   That's what Nietzsche is saying, if that makes sense.
[00:54:13.700 --> 00:54:14.540]   - Yes.
[00:54:14.540 --> 00:54:18.740]   - And he basically says with that comes the ubermensch,
[00:54:18.740 --> 00:54:20.860]   okay, which is the superhuman.
[00:54:20.860 --> 00:54:23.140]   And he says there aren't many of them, he says,
[00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:23.980]   but they're gonna come.
[00:54:23.980 --> 00:54:26.580]   And he also talks about the philosophers of the future.
[00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:29.980]   And he's speaking and writing to them, is my belief.
[00:54:29.980 --> 00:54:33.000]   So he's basically telling you and me,
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:36.100]   because we're now the philosophers of his future, yeah.
[00:54:36.100 --> 00:54:40.080]   He's basically telling us this is what's happening now,
[00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:42.020]   and look what it has done.
[00:54:42.020 --> 00:54:45.540]   He says now everything is possible,
[00:54:45.540 --> 00:54:47.780]   all manner of terrible evil,
[00:54:47.780 --> 00:54:50.620]   because no one has the belief in God anymore.
[00:54:50.620 --> 00:54:53.940]   The belief that there is an afterlife,
[00:54:53.940 --> 00:54:55.140]   you asked about an afterlife.
[00:54:55.140 --> 00:54:58.180]   So with this kind of belief in a morality
[00:54:58.180 --> 00:54:59.760]   comes this belief, you know,
[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:02.100]   you can have morals without God, okay, people do.
[00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:05.500]   But what Christianity is this idea
[00:55:05.500 --> 00:55:08.260]   that you will reap what you sow.
[00:55:08.260 --> 00:55:11.060]   So if people don't believe that anymore, what will happen?
[00:55:11.060 --> 00:55:12.780]   And so that's what he's basically saying,
[00:55:12.780 --> 00:55:17.780]   is that the basic anchor for Western society is now gone.
[00:55:17.780 --> 00:55:19.460]   - Do you think he was right?
[00:55:19.460 --> 00:55:21.460]   - Absolutely, absolutely right.
[00:55:21.460 --> 00:55:24.260]   - But then again, what do you think
[00:55:24.260 --> 00:55:25.700]   if we brought him back to life
[00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:29.260]   and he read "American Cosmic," your book,
[00:55:29.260 --> 00:55:31.860]   and he wrote, he tweeted about it,
[00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:36.540]   writing a review maybe for the,
[00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:38.340]   I don't know what they post, for "New York Times,"
[00:55:38.340 --> 00:55:40.000]   he'd be an editorial writer.
[00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:42.960]   With a blue check mark on Twitter.
[00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:46.400]   What do you think he would say about this idea
[00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:51.400]   that you present that's a grander idea of religion?
[00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:52.920]   And you know--
[00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:55.000]   - Like religiosity, like this new form.
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:55.840]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:59.440]   - Wouldn't that kind of reverse the idea that God is dead?
[00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:02.080]   - Yeah, because it would bring up this idea
[00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:05.760]   of external intelligences that are not human,
[00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:08.920]   which is basically a lot of religions talk about that,
[00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:10.840]   right, there are Bodhisattvas,
[00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:13.360]   there are angels, there are demons,
[00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:17.160]   there's all these types of non-human intelligences
[00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:20.200]   that religion makes space for.
[00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:22.560]   So what I'm basically saying in "American Cosmic"
[00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:27.560]   is these new things are within the realm of UFOs and UAPs.
[00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:33.000]   So no, I think that, well, I think Nietzsche would say
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:36.880]   that that's a progressive adaptation of religion
[00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:38.680]   is what I would hope he would say.
[00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:41.800]   Nietzsche, however, is unpredictable, I think.
[00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:43.560]   I couldn't predict him.
[00:56:43.560 --> 00:56:46.560]   So I would say that it would be my hope
[00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:51.560]   that he would say this is an accurate representation
[00:56:51.560 --> 00:56:55.180]   of a move into a new type of religion.
[00:56:55.180 --> 00:56:58.120]   And it's adaptive, therefore progressive.
[00:56:58.120 --> 00:57:00.240]   - He would probably be uncomfortable reading a book
[00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:02.880]   by a brilliant female professor.
[00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:04.880]   - Who happens also to be short.
[00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:06.600]   (both laughing)
[00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:08.240]   I don't know if you read that.
[00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:09.080]   - No.
[00:57:09.080 --> 00:57:11.960]   - Yeah, oh, he's, he says some pretty nasty things
[00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:13.320]   about short women.
[00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:14.920]   - Oh my God.
[00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:15.760]   - Yeah.
[00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:18.200]   - Oh, Nietzsche, he should be canceled.
[00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:20.840]   No, no, please don't cancel Nietzsche.
[00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:24.000]   You have to take people in the context of their time.
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:25.720]   Although I'm pretty sure in his time,
[00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:26.840]   he was also an asshole.
[00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:27.680]   - He was.
[00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:30.960]   - But assholes are people too.
[00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:31.800]   Okay.
[00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:32.760]   - Just bad ones.
[00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:39.480]   You wrote the book "American Cosmic UFOs,
[00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:41.640]   Religion, Technology."
[00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:43.960]   What was the goal of writing this book?
[00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:46.560]   What maybe, we'll mention it,
[00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:49.080]   we have already mentioned it many times,
[00:57:49.080 --> 00:57:54.080]   but in this little space of a conversation,
[00:57:54.080 --> 00:57:56.440]   can you say maybe what is the key insight
[00:57:56.440 --> 00:57:59.640]   that you found that lingers with you to this day
[00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:02.480]   from the process, the long process
[00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:04.440]   of putting this book together?
[00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:05.560]   - Sure.
[00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:07.840]   Just like with my book on purgatory,
[00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:10.960]   I went into the research thinking
[00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:14.000]   that it would be something that it was entirely not.
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:15.840]   It ended up being something completely different.
[00:58:15.840 --> 00:58:17.120]   And I think that's good.
[00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:20.280]   I think that people who do research need to,
[00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:23.160]   are very excited actually when their research surprises them.
[00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:27.400]   So I was happily surprised by my purgatory book
[00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:30.080]   to learn that it was a place, you know?
[00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:35.080]   And so I went into "American Cosmic"
[00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:39.320]   being a non-believer in UFOs entirely.
[00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:43.580]   And I came out being agnostic, okay?
[00:58:43.580 --> 00:58:46.080]   Kind of believer.
[00:58:46.080 --> 00:58:48.740]   (both laughing)
[00:58:48.740 --> 00:58:50.400]   - Yeah.
[00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:54.560]   But agnostic, sort of open to the mysteries of the world.
[00:58:54.560 --> 00:58:55.400]   - Yes.
[00:58:55.400 --> 00:58:58.480]   And I didn't think that, first of all,
[00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:03.480]   I knew that the government was part of the situation.
[00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:06.400]   I just didn't know how much.
[00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:10.640]   And so I learned that quickly and acclimated to it,
[00:59:10.640 --> 00:59:17.240]   accepted it, and noted that indeed, Horatio,
[00:59:17.240 --> 00:59:27.440]   the world is much more mysterious than we think it is.
[00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:28.800]   It's more mysterious.
[00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:31.640]   There are more mysteries in this life
[00:59:31.640 --> 00:59:34.040]   than your philosophy provides for.
[00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:36.520]   - So is a sense "American Cosmic"
[00:59:36.520 --> 00:59:40.560]   is about the mysteries of the modern life
[00:59:40.560 --> 00:59:44.880]   as encapsulated by the realm of technology
[00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:47.640]   and the realm of alien intelligences?
[00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:52.640]   - Yes, I think that, I mean,
[00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:55.160]   I'd have to go off record as a professor
[00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:56.640]   and talk personally.
[00:59:56.640 --> 01:00:01.640]   As a person, I do think that there are mysteries
[01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:06.200]   of which we have an inkling.
[01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:11.200]   And if it's something as powerful as non-human intelligence,
[01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:15.440]   whether or not it's from another planet, extraterrestrial,
[01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:19.040]   or it happens to be from another dimension
[01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:20.240]   or something else,
[01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:24.600]   I think that this is going to get the attention
[01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:26.400]   of institutions of power.
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:29.240]   And indeed, I think that's what has happened.
[01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:34.240]   And although probably people have had interactions
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:40.720]   with these things, it appears to me historically,
[01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:43.480]   for a long time, as long as humans have existed,
[01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:47.160]   I would imagine that indeed,
[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:50.880]   this is something that's quite powerful
[01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:53.680]   and could change the belief structures
[01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:58.240]   of our entire societies, our civilization, basically.
[01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:00.360]   - So it's the same way that you're talking,
[01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:02.320]   the belief structures were strongly affected
[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:04.720]   by religious beliefs throughout history
[01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:06.760]   in the same way this has the potential.
[01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:13.360]   It serves as a source of concern for the powerful
[01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:18.760]   because it can have very significant effects
[01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:20.600]   on the populace. - Huge effects, yes.
[01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:23.760]   - Is there some broader understanding
[01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:26.600]   of how we should think about alien intelligences
[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:29.320]   than like little green men?
[01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:30.160]   - Yes.
[01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:34.120]   - That you can maybe elaborate on and talk about?
[01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:36.800]   - Yes, this comes directly out of my research
[01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:38.200]   in Catholic history.
[01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:42.000]   What I found was that, let's take for instance,
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.480]   this idea of an angel.
[01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:46.040]   Okay, so we all think we know what an angel looks like, why?
[01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:47.680]   Well, we've been told what an angel looks like,
[01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:49.640]   we see what an angel looks like.
[01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:51.600]   Throughout history, people have painted angels
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:53.760]   and they all look pretty much the same.
[01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:56.480]   But actually, if you go to the primary sources
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:02:01.480]   on either in Hebrew or in Greek or in whatever language
[01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:06.760]   and in Latin, and you look at experiences
[01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:09.200]   that people have talked about,
[01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:12.160]   where they've written down their experiences about angels,
[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:16.200]   angels don't at all look like what we think,
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:18.600]   they don't look like little cherubs with wings,
[01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:21.920]   they don't look like tall, strong,
[01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:27.240]   anthropomorphic, human looking things, they don't.
[01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:28.840]   They look really weird.
[01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:33.280]   And sometimes they don't look at all humanoid.
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:36.920]   They look like strange spinning things, right?
[01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:39.120]   With like eyes and things like that.
[01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:42.200]   They communicate telepathically with us.
[01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:46.360]   Okay, so what does that mean for the idea of extraterrestrials
[01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:48.440]   or what we consider to be aliens?
[01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:55.760]   I do think that, first, if we are,
[01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:58.920]   listen, I'm not the first to say this.
[01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:02.440]   If we're in contact with non-human intelligence,
[01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:06.400]   we're most likely in contact with its technology.
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:09.000]   Because think about us.
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.640]   Do we send human beings to Mars yet?
[01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:14.480]   Some people would say yes, but let's put that aside.
[01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:16.880]   So no, we don't, we use our technology.
[01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:19.440]   We send our rovers to Mars, okay?
[01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:23.000]   Okay, so if there's an extraterrestrial civilization,
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:26.680]   is it sending, are they coming by themselves?
[01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:28.120]   Are they coming to see us?
[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:29.880]   Or are they sending their technology?
[01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:32.680]   Most likely, they either are technology
[01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:34.560]   or they are sending their technology.
[01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:35.880]   - Yeah, there might be a gray area
[01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:38.160]   between what is technology and what the aliens are.
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:39.160]   - Yeah.
[01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:42.640]   - So but you're saying like basically a robotic probe
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:44.040]   that would be the equivalent of us,
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:46.200]   our human civilization created technology.
[01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:50.880]   - Way more advanced than what we could believe
[01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:52.880]   to be a probe, all right?
[01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:54.960]   - It's kind of funny to think about like,
[01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:57.920]   if whatever sort of
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:04.800]   extraterrestrial creations have visited Earth,
[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:07.720]   that we're interacting with some like
[01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:09.560]   dumb, crappy drone technology.
[01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:10.600]   - Yeah, it's true.
[01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:12.080]   (both laughing)
[01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:12.920]   - And we're like,
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:18.040]   we're like building these like myths and so on
[01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:20.680]   from like an experience with some like crappy drone
[01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:23.000]   made by some crappy startup somewhere.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:23.840]   - That is correct.
[01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:25.480]   (both laughing)
[01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:28.720]   - When the actual intelligence is like something
[01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:30.600]   much grander.
[01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:34.440]   Yeah, that's the more likely situation.
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:36.280]   - That's what I like to tell people.
[01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:39.080]   I'm like, no, it's probably a lot weirder than you think.
[01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:41.120]   - Yeah, oh boy.
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:44.720]   So but what forms can it possibly take?
[01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:47.480]   - So I really love this idea that
[01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:53.000]   I tend to be humble in the face of all that we don't know.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:57.760]   And I tend to believe that the form alien life forms
[01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:01.960]   would take and the way they would communicate
[01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:05.440]   is much more likely to be of a form
[01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:07.080]   that we can't even comprehend
[01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:10.040]   or perhaps can't even perceive directly.
[01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:15.080]   So like, it could be in the space of,
[01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:18.320]   we don't understand most of how our mind works.
[01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:19.160]   It could be in the space
[01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:21.360]   of whatever the heck consciousness is.
[01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:25.280]   Like maybe consciousness itself is communication
[01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:30.160]   with aliens or like, I don't know.
[01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:34.120]   It could be just our own thoughts
[01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:39.120]   is actually the alien life forms communicating.
[01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:41.200]   Like, I know all of that sounds crazy,
[01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:42.880]   but I'm saying like, I'm just trying to come up
[01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:44.200]   with the craziest possible thing
[01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:47.040]   that doesn't make any sense that could very well be true.
[01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:49.640]   And you can't say it's not true
[01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:51.520]   because we don't understand basically anything
[01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:52.520]   about our mind.
[01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:55.260]   So it could be all of those things.
[01:05:55.260 --> 01:05:57.620]   Everything from hallucinations,
[01:05:57.620 --> 01:05:59.160]   all the things that are explored
[01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:04.160]   through the different drugs that we've talked about
[01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:06.360]   in this podcast in general.
[01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:08.040]   Joe Rogan loves to talk about DMT
[01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:11.040]   and all those kinds of hallucinogenic drugs.
[01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:15.600]   All of it, including love and fear,
[01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:17.040]   all of those things that could be aliens
[01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:17.880]   communicating with us.
[01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:20.440]   Memes on the internet that could be.
[01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:23.040]   Pretty sure humor is alien communication.
[01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:24.200]   No, I don't know.
[01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:27.680]   But is there some way that's helpful for you
[01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:30.520]   to think about beyond the little green men?
[01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:32.080]   - Oh, absolutely.
[01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:35.360]   It accords exactly with how I think actually.
[01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:36.680]   So I'll explain.
[01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:41.080]   I liked in American Cosmic,
[01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:44.000]   I attained the status of full professor.
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.400]   So I was like, okay, I can pretty much write this book
[01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:47.240]   like I wanna do it.
[01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:48.060]   And I did.
[01:06:48.060 --> 01:06:51.680]   So I used a lot of quotes from cool artists like David Bowie.
[01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:54.360]   Okay, so David Bowie opens the book, okay?
[01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:56.400]   And he basically says, and so does Nietzsche, by the way,
[01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:58.760]   David Bowie and Nietzsche, boom,
[01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:00.920]   two awesome quotes right together.
[01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:01.760]   That's how I opened my book.
[01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:02.580]   - No better opener.
[01:07:02.580 --> 01:07:03.420]   - Yeah.
[01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:04.240]   - Do you remember the quotes?
[01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:05.080]   - Yeah, of course.
[01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:06.960]   So the first quote by David Bowie,
[01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:08.280]   and that's what I'm gonna concentrate on
[01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:10.820]   in response to what you just said,
[01:07:10.820 --> 01:07:13.160]   which I think is absolutely correct.
[01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:16.320]   David Bowie said, "The internet is an alien life form."
[01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:19.880]   Okay, and if you've not seen David Bowie's interview
[01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:22.200]   where he says that, I highly recommend it.
[01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:23.600]   He's so brilliant.
[01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:25.480]   Okay, so David Bowie is actually quite brilliant
[01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:27.840]   about the idea of UFOs.
[01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:30.920]   He's also brilliant about the idea of technology, okay?
[01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:32.400]   And most people wouldn't think that,
[01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:36.080]   but I mean, he's pretty darn smart, okay?
[01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:38.560]   So, all right, so I started to think about it,
[01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:42.000]   and I also, early on in my research, met Jacques Vallée.
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.040]   Okay, so he's a technologist.
[01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:46.760]   He has a PhD in information technology
[01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:49.720]   from computer science, basically, from Northwestern,
[01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:50.920]   and he got that back in the day.
[01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:51.920]   You know, when I say back in the day,
[01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:53.480]   I'm not talking a thousand years ago.
[01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:54.920]   I'm talking like in the '60s, okay?
[01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:55.740]   So he's--
[01:07:55.740 --> 01:07:58.280]   - Back when computer science wasn't really even a field
[01:07:58.280 --> 01:07:59.480]   that you can get a degree in.
[01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:01.640]   - Yeah, he has a PhD in it.
[01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:03.320]   And he's French, he's from France,
[01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:04.760]   but he lives in Silicon Valley,
[01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:08.160]   and he worked on ARPANET, which is the proto-internet.
[01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:09.000]   He mapped Mars.
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.000]   He's also an astronomer.
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.400]   I mean, he's just this all-around brilliant guy, right?
[01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:14.520]   And he's also interested in UFOs,
[01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:17.680]   and most people take those two interests of his
[01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:19.440]   as separate interests,
[01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:21.920]   and I remember being at a very small conference
[01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:24.080]   and listening to him, being in awe, of course,
[01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:26.400]   because he's an awe-inspiring person,
[01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:28.200]   and then thinking, "Wait a minute.
[01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:30.680]   "Why do people compartmentalize
[01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:33.480]   "those two things about him that are one and the same?"
[01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:34.320]   Okay?
[01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:37.360]   So when we talk about UFOs and UAPs and stuff,
[01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:40.200]   we have to talk about digital technology
[01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:41.260]   and things like that.
[01:08:41.260 --> 01:08:44.440]   Now, if we're going back to what I,
[01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:46.260]   so if I were to say what,
[01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:48.640]   if I were to believe in, and I,
[01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:51.520]   like I said earlier, I was agnostic, bordering on belief,
[01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:54.800]   most likely a believer, in this extraterrestrial,
[01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:57.760]   or not extraterrestrial, let me put it another way,
[01:08:57.760 --> 01:09:00.680]   non-human intelligence that's communicating with us,
[01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:03.040]   I'm gonna tell you how I think they communicate with us,
[01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:05.320]   and I go back to the Greeks again, okay?
[01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:08.400]   And the Greeks had this idea of muses,
[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:09.560]   you know, the muses?
[01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:11.640]   So, okay, so there are these things called muses,
[01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:14.760]   and we tend to think of them as metaphors, right?
[01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:16.280]   But what if they're not?
[01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:18.840]   What if they're actually non-human intelligence
[01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:21.160]   trying to communicate with us, but we're so stupid?
[01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:22.680]   We can't, like, understand, or like,
[01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:24.720]   so only people with, like, you know,
[01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:30.120]   super amazing capacities, like poetic, creative,
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:33.320]   you know, intelligent, mathematical, whatever,
[01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:35.400]   you know, 'cause they tend to do this symbolically,
[01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:38.240]   they tend to communicate with us in symbols form,
[01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:40.700]   and so music, you know, symbols,
[01:09:40.700 --> 01:09:42.960]   we've got math that are, you know, it's a symbolic language,
[01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:47.180]   and so what, so, okay, so muses are probably a good idea
[01:09:47.180 --> 01:09:49.520]   for me of what this would be.
[01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:52.320]   Now, would muses have spaceships, you know,
[01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:55.680]   or those things that we call physical counterparts
[01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:57.240]   to what they are?
[01:09:57.240 --> 01:09:59.920]   That's another question altogether,
[01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:02.680]   but if, you know, now, why would I think this?
[01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:06.220]   Because if you look at the history of our space programs,
[01:10:06.220 --> 01:10:08.480]   both Russian and American,
[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:10.280]   you're gonna find some pretty weird stuff,
[01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:12.760]   pretty weird history there, Lex.
[01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:16.680]   So you wanna get an idea, go back to Tchaikovsky
[01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:18.960]   and read a little bit about what he has to say.
[01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:21.900]   If you look back at the history of our space programs,
[01:10:21.900 --> 01:10:25.080]   the viable space programs are both Russian and American,
[01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:30.080]   and each has an amazingly strange history,
[01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:33.800]   because the founders of the calculations
[01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:36.780]   that got us up into space, the rocket scientists, basically,
[01:10:36.780 --> 01:10:38.440]   were doing some pretty weird rituals
[01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:40.280]   and doing religious things, right?
[01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:43.440]   They weren't necessarily, like, Jack Parson's on our side,
[01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:46.240]   I was out in the desert with people like L. Ron Hubbard
[01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:50.080]   and doing really intense rituals,
[01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:52.380]   believing that they were opening stargates
[01:10:52.380 --> 01:10:53.220]   and things like that, okay?
[01:10:53.220 --> 01:10:54.060]   - That's awesome.
[01:10:54.060 --> 01:10:55.460]   - And they were really doing that, okay?
[01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:59.300]   So then you go to the Russian side,
[01:10:59.300 --> 01:11:03.540]   and they had a very specific, non-dogmatic,
[01:11:03.540 --> 01:11:06.420]   according to Catholics or Orthodox Christianity,
[01:11:06.420 --> 01:11:08.380]   idea of what Christianity was,
[01:11:08.380 --> 01:11:11.060]   and they believed that they were interacting with angels,
[01:11:11.060 --> 01:11:13.260]   okay, non-human intelligences.
[01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:15.980]   So if you look back and you see muses,
[01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:19.180]   you know, you can contextualize them within this tradition.
[01:11:19.180 --> 01:11:21.200]   And so when I started to talk to people
[01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:23.360]   who were actually in the space program
[01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:25.560]   and who were in these programs that,
[01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:26.760]   now the government has said,
[01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:29.100]   "Oh yeah, we do have those programs,"
[01:11:29.100 --> 01:11:30.960]   they have the same belief structures.
[01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:33.000]   They believe that they were also in contact
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:34.560]   with these non-human intelligences,
[01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:35.920]   and they were getting what they call
[01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:38.280]   downloads of information and creating,
[01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:40.760]   sometimes with Tyler D. in my book,
[01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:43.520]   creating technologies that were real,
[01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:46.560]   and they were selling them on NASDAQ for a lot of money,
[01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:49.340]   like, you know, say $100 million or something like that,
[01:11:49.340 --> 01:11:52.180]   undisclosed amounts, but a lot.
[01:11:52.180 --> 01:11:56.460]   And these things are viable technologies that we use now,
[01:11:56.460 --> 01:11:58.380]   and they make our lives better,
[01:11:58.380 --> 01:12:00.860]   and we progress as a species because of them.
[01:12:00.860 --> 01:12:04.540]   Now, that has nothing to do with the scientific method,
[01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:07.420]   as much as I know, as much as anybody's going to get angry
[01:12:07.420 --> 01:12:10.220]   at me for saying that, but you know, sorry,
[01:12:10.220 --> 01:12:12.540]   those were strange encounters
[01:12:12.540 --> 01:12:16.920]   that created our ability to go into space.
[01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:18.640]   I don't know if they're real or not,
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:20.560]   but these people believe they were real.
[01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:22.840]   - Right, so they have a power
[01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:26.240]   in actually having an impact in this world,
[01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:31.200]   in inspiring humans to create technology,
[01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:32.520]   which enables us to do things
[01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:33.960]   we haven't been able to do before.
[01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:34.800]   - Yeah.
[01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:38.640]   - And these, I like how we're putting like angels,
[01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:44.220]   alien life forms, aliens, and technology
[01:12:44.220 --> 01:12:48.260]   all in the non-human intelligence camp,
[01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:53.260]   which I really like that 'cause that's very true.
[01:12:53.260 --> 01:12:58.740]   It's this other source of wisdom, intelligence,
[01:12:58.740 --> 01:13:02.460]   maybe a connection to the mysterious.
[01:13:02.460 --> 01:13:05.120]   - Yes, I was really surprised by it.
[01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:08.060]   - Can you speak a little bit more
[01:13:08.060 --> 01:13:13.020]   to the connection between aliens and technology
[01:13:13.020 --> 01:13:19.220]   that Jacques Vallee had in his own one individual mind
[01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:21.300]   that's very tempting to kind of separate
[01:13:21.300 --> 01:13:25.700]   as two separate endeavors?
[01:13:25.700 --> 01:13:30.700]   Why did you come to believe that they are one and the same,
[01:13:30.700 --> 01:13:35.900]   or at least part of the same intellectual journey?
[01:13:37.900 --> 01:13:39.220]   - Thanks for asking that again,
[01:13:39.220 --> 01:13:41.940]   because nobody asks me that question,
[01:13:41.940 --> 01:13:46.260]   and it's central to my project.
[01:13:46.260 --> 01:13:51.260]   So Jacques was a huge influence, is a huge influence on me.
[01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:53.340]   He taught me a lot.
[01:13:53.340 --> 01:13:59.860]   He gave me access to some of his information that he keeps,
[01:13:59.860 --> 01:14:03.620]   but a lot of his information is actually there out there
[01:14:03.620 --> 01:14:05.340]   for everyone to read.
[01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:07.540]   He has an academia.edu page,
[01:14:07.540 --> 01:14:10.580]   and he just, so he didn't have this, unfortunately,
[01:14:10.580 --> 01:14:14.440]   when I was doing my research in 2012 and 2013,
[01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:17.420]   so I had to go back and do microfiche type stuff.
[01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:19.840]   What I did was I began to read everything that he wrote,
[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:21.700]   and he actually gave me a lot of his books too,
[01:14:21.700 --> 01:14:25.380]   and he told me, I remember, he dropped me off from,
[01:14:25.380 --> 01:14:26.940]   this is actually quite interesting
[01:14:26.940 --> 01:14:29.420]   if you'll allow me to tell you a little story.
[01:14:29.420 --> 01:14:30.460]   - Please. - Okay.
[01:14:30.460 --> 01:14:33.540]   And it also includes ayahuasca, so. (laughs)
[01:14:33.540 --> 01:14:35.740]   - Great, every story that includes ayahuasca
[01:14:35.740 --> 01:14:36.940]   is a great story.
[01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:39.220]   - Okay, so I was at a conference,
[01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:43.180]   and it was a small conference of very interesting people
[01:14:43.180 --> 01:14:46.780]   in California on the Pacific Ocean, and Jacques was there.
[01:14:46.780 --> 01:14:49.460]   And this is actually, it opens my book.
[01:14:49.460 --> 01:14:53.660]   This is the, I go, it's the preface to my book.
[01:14:53.660 --> 01:14:54.940]   I go on this ride.
[01:14:54.940 --> 01:14:56.980]   He takes me through Silicon Valley.
[01:14:56.980 --> 01:14:58.700]   I've lived there, right?
[01:14:58.700 --> 01:15:00.420]   My grandparents grew up in the same place
[01:15:00.420 --> 01:15:02.940]   that he raised his children in Belmont.
[01:15:02.940 --> 01:15:06.020]   And so, but we were there with Robbie Graham,
[01:15:06.020 --> 01:15:09.180]   who's a great ufologist in his own right,
[01:15:09.180 --> 01:15:12.300]   and film theorist.
[01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:14.580]   I highly recommend his work.
[01:15:14.580 --> 01:15:17.620]   So we were together, and he was taking us to San Francisco
[01:15:17.620 --> 01:15:19.260]   where I was gonna meet my brother
[01:15:19.260 --> 01:15:20.540]   who was going to take me home.
[01:15:20.540 --> 01:15:23.740]   And so he took us on this long journey,
[01:15:23.740 --> 01:15:26.300]   and he talked to us, and as we got out of the car,
[01:15:26.300 --> 01:15:29.940]   he gave me several of his books,
[01:15:29.940 --> 01:15:31.700]   and one in particular he gave me,
[01:15:31.700 --> 01:15:33.580]   and he said, "Read this first."
[01:15:33.580 --> 01:15:34.420]   (both laugh)
[01:15:34.620 --> 01:15:37.340]   And I was like, okay, I definitely will read that first.
[01:15:37.340 --> 01:15:39.620]   Okay, so this is how the ayahuasca figures in.
[01:15:39.620 --> 01:15:43.340]   So we were, I didn't take it, nor have I taken it.
[01:15:43.340 --> 01:15:47.940]   Okay, so we were at this place in California,
[01:15:47.940 --> 01:15:49.740]   and Alex Gray and his wife were there,
[01:15:49.740 --> 01:15:52.580]   and they were talking about their experiences
[01:15:52.580 --> 01:15:53.660]   with psychedelics.
[01:15:53.660 --> 01:15:56.700]   You know, he's an amazing visionary artist, okay?
[01:15:56.700 --> 01:16:00.340]   So he believes that there's this place that you can enter,
[01:16:00.340 --> 01:16:02.980]   and he and his wife would enter this space
[01:16:02.980 --> 01:16:06.940]   with either ayahuasca or LSD or something like that,
[01:16:06.940 --> 01:16:08.580]   and they would not talk to each other,
[01:16:08.580 --> 01:16:11.780]   but they would be having the same exact experience.
[01:16:11.780 --> 01:16:15.020]   So it was almost like having the same dream, right?
[01:16:15.020 --> 01:16:16.100]   - Wow. - Okay.
[01:16:16.100 --> 01:16:20.980]   So somehow that whole event with Jacques there,
[01:16:20.980 --> 01:16:25.020]   and them talking about their experiences in these realms,
[01:16:25.020 --> 01:16:27.340]   of which religious studies people are quite familiar,
[01:16:27.340 --> 01:16:30.820]   by the way, because visionary experiences are what we study.
[01:16:30.820 --> 01:16:33.140]   So all of this seems super familiar to me,
[01:16:33.140 --> 01:16:36.740]   and I recognized that immediately that Jacques,
[01:16:36.740 --> 01:16:43.500]   it hit me like, you know, very obvious that UFOs
[01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:48.500]   and these experiences and technology all seemed,
[01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:50.740]   they were all meshed together.
[01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:52.580]   And I knew that I had to take them,
[01:16:52.580 --> 01:16:54.460]   I knew I had to read everything Jacques ever wrote.
[01:16:54.460 --> 01:16:56.540]   And the best stuff he's written, by the way,
[01:16:56.540 --> 01:17:00.100]   is his little essays that he wrote in the 1970s,
[01:17:00.100 --> 01:17:01.540]   and they were peer reviewed essays
[01:17:01.540 --> 01:17:03.220]   about the beginning of the internet
[01:17:03.220 --> 01:17:07.980]   and how a lot of it was based on basically
[01:17:07.980 --> 01:17:12.100]   neural connection with the internet,
[01:17:12.100 --> 01:17:14.800]   like somehow psychic connection through the internet
[01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:15.980]   with others and things like that.
[01:17:15.980 --> 01:17:18.540]   - So the brain is a biological neural network.
[01:17:18.540 --> 01:17:21.700]   There's this connection between visual neurons and so on,
[01:17:21.700 --> 01:17:25.580]   and that's what ultimately is able to have memories
[01:17:25.580 --> 01:17:29.580]   and has cognitive ability and is able to perceive the world
[01:17:29.580 --> 01:17:31.540]   and generate ideas.
[01:17:31.540 --> 01:17:35.260]   And those ideas are then spread on the internet
[01:17:35.260 --> 01:17:37.500]   even from the very early days to other humans.
[01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:40.860]   So it gets injected or travels into the brains
[01:17:40.860 --> 01:17:43.060]   of other humans and that goes around in there
[01:17:43.060 --> 01:17:45.860]   and then spits out other stuff and it goes back and forth.
[01:17:45.860 --> 01:17:49.620]   So it's nice to think of the network that's in our mind,
[01:17:49.620 --> 01:17:53.500]   individual mind, as, I mean,
[01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:56.580]   very much even deeply connected to the network
[01:17:56.580 --> 01:17:59.100]   that is the connection between humans
[01:17:59.100 --> 01:18:00.140]   through the internet. - Yes.
[01:18:00.140 --> 01:18:03.660]   - And so in that sense, Jacques saw the internet
[01:18:03.660 --> 01:18:05.940]   as this powerful,
[01:18:05.940 --> 01:18:11.580]   as a source of power and wisdom that is beyond our own.
[01:18:11.580 --> 01:18:13.220]   - Exactly, that's external to us,
[01:18:13.220 --> 01:18:17.420]   like a non, like if you could call it autonomous AI, right?
[01:18:17.420 --> 01:18:19.420]   - It's non-human intelligence in a sense,
[01:18:19.420 --> 01:18:21.480]   even though humans are a part of it.
[01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:23.140]   - Yes, or we're invaded by it,
[01:18:23.140 --> 01:18:24.660]   or whatever you wanna call it, okay.
[01:18:24.660 --> 01:18:28.100]   - Yeah, whoever, right, it's the chicken and the egg, right.
[01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:32.300]   So if I can go on, I want to experience things still.
[01:18:32.300 --> 01:18:33.620]   I'm not done with that.
[01:18:33.620 --> 01:18:37.220]   So this is where I come to this idea
[01:18:37.220 --> 01:18:40.900]   that we're in this space,
[01:18:40.900 --> 01:18:43.700]   we're in now a new space of religion, of religiosity.
[01:18:43.700 --> 01:18:46.860]   So what happens is then, and it's like a biosphere,
[01:18:46.860 --> 01:18:48.300]   and I'll talk about that in a minute.
[01:18:48.300 --> 01:18:50.800]   So Jacques takes us back.
[01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:53.700]   We get to San Francisco and my brother,
[01:18:53.700 --> 01:18:57.060]   who is your straight-laced person,
[01:18:57.060 --> 01:18:59.020]   army guy and everything like that.
[01:18:59.020 --> 01:19:01.540]   I get into his car and the first thing he tells me is,
[01:19:01.540 --> 01:19:03.020]   "I took ayahuasca."
[01:19:03.020 --> 01:19:04.780]   And I was like, "What?"
[01:19:04.780 --> 01:19:06.700]   And he goes, "It's gonna save humanity."
[01:19:06.700 --> 01:19:09.700]   (both laughing)
[01:19:09.700 --> 01:19:10.540]   - That's great.
[01:19:10.540 --> 01:19:11.360]   - Yeah.
[01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:12.200]   - As I mentioned to you offline,
[01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:15.460]   I talked to Matthew Johnson, he's a Hopkins professor.
[01:19:15.460 --> 01:19:19.060]   He's really a scholar of most,
[01:19:19.060 --> 01:19:21.100]   he's studied most drugs.
[01:19:21.100 --> 01:19:23.060]   He's also really deeply studied cocaine,
[01:19:23.060 --> 01:19:24.980]   all those stuff, negative effects.
[01:19:24.980 --> 01:19:28.420]   And he's focused on a lot of positive effects
[01:19:28.420 --> 01:19:30.020]   of the different psychedelics.
[01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:30.920]   It's kind of fascinating.
[01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:35.660]   So I'm very much interested in exploring
[01:19:35.660 --> 01:19:41.780]   the science of what these things do to the human mind,
[01:19:41.780 --> 01:19:43.700]   and also personally exploring it.
[01:19:43.700 --> 01:19:45.620]   Although it's like this weird gray area,
[01:19:45.620 --> 01:19:48.180]   which he's masterful at,
[01:19:48.180 --> 01:19:51.380]   which is he's a professor at Johns Hopkins,
[01:19:51.380 --> 01:19:54.540]   one of the most prestigious universities in the world.
[01:19:54.540 --> 01:19:57.860]   And doing large scale studies of this stuff.
[01:19:57.860 --> 01:20:02.300]   And until he got a lot of money for these studies,
[01:20:02.300 --> 01:20:06.220]   even in Hopkins itself, there's not much respect.
[01:20:06.220 --> 01:20:08.820]   It's not even respect, it was like,
[01:20:08.820 --> 01:20:11.100]   people just didn't wanna talk about it
[01:20:11.100 --> 01:20:13.500]   as a legitimate field of inquiry.
[01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:16.820]   It's kind of fascinating how hesitant we are
[01:20:16.820 --> 01:20:19.900]   as a little human civilization
[01:20:19.900 --> 01:20:24.140]   to legitimize the exploration of the mysterious,
[01:20:24.140 --> 01:20:27.040]   of whatever the definition of the mysterious is
[01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:29.020]   for that particular period of time.
[01:20:29.020 --> 01:20:32.420]   So for us now, there's little groups of things.
[01:20:32.420 --> 01:20:35.180]   I would say consciousness in the space
[01:20:35.180 --> 01:20:37.700]   of computer science research is something
[01:20:37.700 --> 01:20:40.500]   that's still, I don't know,
[01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:42.260]   maybe we'll let philosophers kick it around
[01:20:42.260 --> 01:20:43.460]   for a little longer.
[01:20:43.460 --> 01:20:47.100]   And then certainly extraterrestrial life forms
[01:20:50.180 --> 01:20:55.060]   in most formulations of that problem space
[01:20:55.060 --> 01:20:57.300]   is still the other.
[01:20:57.300 --> 01:20:58.980]   It's still the source of the mysterious,
[01:20:58.980 --> 01:21:02.140]   except maybe like SETI, which is like,
[01:21:02.140 --> 01:21:05.940]   how can we detect signals from far away alien intelligences
[01:21:05.940 --> 01:21:09.060]   that we'll be able to perceive?
[01:21:09.060 --> 01:21:12.660]   Yeah, and psychedelics is another one of those.
[01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:14.700]   That's like, we're starting to see,
[01:21:14.700 --> 01:21:16.880]   okay, well, can we try to see
[01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:19.520]   if there's some medical applications
[01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:22.480]   of helping you get, like he does studies
[01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:24.520]   of help you quit smoking,
[01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:27.480]   or help you in some kind of treatment of some disease.
[01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:29.560]   And he's sneaking into that.
[01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:31.640]   I mean, it's like openly sneaking into it.
[01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:34.440]   He's doing studies on it of like,
[01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:38.800]   how can you expand the mind with these tools,
[01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:40.360]   and what can the mind discover
[01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:42.720]   through psychedelics and so on?
[01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:45.500]   And we're slowly creeping into the space
[01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:48.080]   of being able to explore these mysterious questions.
[01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:51.720]   But it's like, it sucks that sometimes a lot of people
[01:21:51.720 --> 01:21:56.560]   have to die, meaning, sorry, they have to age out.
[01:21:56.560 --> 01:22:02.440]   Like it's like faculty and people
[01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:06.120]   have a fixed set of ideas, and they stick by them.
[01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:08.320]   And in order for new ideas to come in,
[01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:12.160]   then the young folks have to be born
[01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:14.920]   with an open mind, the possibility of those ideas,
[01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:17.040]   and then they have to become old enough
[01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:18.600]   and get A's in school and whatever
[01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:21.760]   to then carry those ideas forward.
[01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:25.400]   So, the acceptance of the exploration
[01:22:25.400 --> 01:22:27.220]   and the mysterious takes time.
[01:22:27.220 --> 01:22:28.520]   It's kind of sad.
[01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:31.120]   - It is sad, I agree.
[01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:35.800]   - Maybe to go into my source of passion,
[01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:38.000]   which is artificial intelligence.
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:43.000]   What's your sense about the possibility
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:48.600]   like Pamela McCordick has this quote that I like.
[01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:50.520]   I talked to her a couple years ago,
[01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:52.840]   or I guess already on this podcast,
[01:22:52.840 --> 01:22:57.720]   that artificial intelligence began
[01:22:57.720 --> 01:23:00.400]   with the ancient wish to forge the gods.
[01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:04.920]   So, do you think artificial intelligence
[01:23:04.920 --> 01:23:09.920]   may become the very kind of gods
[01:23:11.460 --> 01:23:15.700]   that were at the center of the religions
[01:23:15.700 --> 01:23:16.860]   of most of our history?
[01:23:16.860 --> 01:23:19.540]   - Yeah, there's a lot there.
[01:23:19.540 --> 01:23:23.500]   So, I'm gonna start by addressing this idea
[01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:26.700]   of artificial intelligence being separate
[01:23:26.700 --> 01:23:29.340]   from human beings, okay?
[01:23:29.340 --> 01:23:34.340]   So, I don't think that's actually, that might happen, okay?
[01:23:34.340 --> 01:23:36.660]   I mean, it's already happened, but let's put it this way.
[01:23:36.660 --> 01:23:38.940]   Like, you're talking about super artificial intelligence,
[01:23:38.940 --> 01:23:42.540]   like autonomous, conscious artificial intelligence?
[01:23:42.540 --> 01:23:43.660]   Okay, yeah.
[01:23:43.660 --> 01:23:45.980]   - Something with artificial consciousness.
[01:23:45.980 --> 01:23:49.380]   - First of all, I think she's correct, okay?
[01:23:49.380 --> 01:23:52.900]   But also, there's an awesome quote.
[01:23:52.900 --> 01:23:57.900]   I'd also like to bring up this writer of fiction, actually.
[01:23:57.900 --> 01:24:01.740]   Ted Chiang, and one of his essays, he writes short essays.
[01:24:01.740 --> 01:24:04.740]   One of them was "The Basis for the Movie Arrival,"
[01:24:04.740 --> 01:24:05.780]   which if you haven't seen it,
[01:24:05.780 --> 01:24:09.380]   it's a really great movie about UFOs.
[01:24:09.380 --> 01:24:15.060]   - It has a very creative way of proposing an idea
[01:24:15.060 --> 01:24:17.060]   of how they might be able to communicate.
[01:24:17.060 --> 01:24:20.180]   First of all, how they appear to us.
[01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:23.420]   Second of all, how they may be communicating with us humans.
[01:24:23.420 --> 01:24:25.060]   - Exactly.
[01:24:25.060 --> 01:24:27.780]   The author, Ted Chiang, has a lot.
[01:24:27.780 --> 01:24:31.780]   I recommend his writings, his short stories.
[01:24:31.780 --> 01:24:35.580]   One is very short, and it appeared as,
[01:24:35.580 --> 01:24:38.380]   it appeared in "Nature" about 20 years ago,
[01:24:38.380 --> 01:24:41.060]   and it is called, I think it's called
[01:24:41.060 --> 01:24:43.860]   "Eating the Crumbs from the Table," or something like that.
[01:24:43.860 --> 01:24:46.660]   And it's basically this short essay,
[01:24:46.660 --> 01:24:50.180]   and I hate to do a spoiler here,
[01:24:50.180 --> 01:24:53.040]   but if you don't wanna know what it's about,
[01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:53.880]   don't listen right now.
[01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:54.860]   - Yeah, spoiler alert.
[01:24:54.860 --> 01:24:57.340]   - Yeah, okay, so this is what it's about.
[01:24:57.340 --> 01:24:59.620]   So basically, it's about human beings
[01:24:59.620 --> 01:25:03.500]   becoming two different species, okay?
[01:25:03.500 --> 01:25:06.780]   And one of them is created, they're called metahumans,
[01:25:06.780 --> 01:25:11.020]   and they start biohacking themselves with tech, okay?
[01:25:11.020 --> 01:25:12.380]   Sound familiar?
[01:25:12.380 --> 01:25:15.460]   So they do this, and they become metahumans
[01:25:15.460 --> 01:25:18.100]   and another species, right?
[01:25:18.100 --> 01:25:21.300]   And just kind of another fork,
[01:25:21.300 --> 01:25:26.300]   such that humans can barely understand them
[01:25:26.300 --> 01:25:28.580]   because they're so far removed.
[01:25:28.580 --> 01:25:32.300]   So in a sense, are they gods, right?
[01:25:32.300 --> 01:25:34.140]   No, they're metahumans, they're superhumans,
[01:25:34.140 --> 01:25:35.580]   they're enhanced humans, okay?
[01:25:35.580 --> 01:25:38.460]   I see that, hopefully, on the horizon, frankly.
[01:25:38.460 --> 01:25:39.360]   I hope so.
[01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:40.780]   Not that we have two species,
[01:25:40.780 --> 01:25:43.180]   but that we can use our technology,
[01:25:43.180 --> 01:25:48.180]   or we can become so integrated with our technology
[01:25:48.180 --> 01:25:50.140]   that we can survive, okay?
[01:25:50.140 --> 01:25:53.000]   We can survive the radiation in space.
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.780]   We can't go places now because of the radiation in space.
[01:25:55.780 --> 01:25:58.100]   Perhaps we can develop our bodies
[01:25:58.100 --> 01:26:01.060]   such that we can survive the radiation in space.
[01:26:01.060 --> 01:26:03.220]   So there's this idea of these metahumans.
[01:26:03.220 --> 01:26:07.220]   Now, there's also this idea that technology
[01:26:07.220 --> 01:26:09.300]   is just another form of humans.
[01:26:09.300 --> 01:26:10.740]   We've created it, right?
[01:26:10.740 --> 01:26:14.220]   And so maybe it is bent on surviving,
[01:26:14.220 --> 01:26:18.060]   thereby using us kind of as a meme or a team.
[01:26:18.060 --> 01:26:19.420]   Some people are calling them teams now,
[01:26:19.420 --> 01:26:20.900]   these self-generating,
[01:26:20.900 --> 01:26:25.060]   they're replicating themselves through us, okay?
[01:26:25.060 --> 01:26:28.980]   I see that also, and I don't think that's terribly bad.
[01:26:28.980 --> 01:26:32.020]   Maybe it's just the way that we are evolving.
[01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:34.460]   It doesn't mean that, you know,
[01:26:34.460 --> 01:26:36.020]   we're evolving all the time.
[01:26:36.020 --> 01:26:37.620]   We're taller than we used to be.
[01:26:37.620 --> 01:26:40.620]   We have different skills.
[01:26:40.620 --> 01:26:43.380]   So I don't see that as a bad thing.
[01:26:43.380 --> 01:26:44.460]   I think a lot of people see it as,
[01:26:44.460 --> 01:26:47.520]   if we're not how we are now, it's a tragedy.
[01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:48.660]   But it's not a tragedy.
[01:26:48.660 --> 01:26:51.820]   How we are now is actually a tragedy for most people alive.
[01:26:51.820 --> 01:26:53.580]   - Yeah, and we might be evolving in ways
[01:26:53.580 --> 01:26:54.700]   we can't possibly perceive.
[01:26:54.700 --> 01:26:58.580]   Like you said, that humans have created Twitter,
[01:26:58.580 --> 01:27:00.940]   and Twitter may be changing us
[01:27:00.940 --> 01:27:05.460]   in ways that we can't even understand now currently.
[01:27:05.460 --> 01:27:07.220]   Like from a perspective,
[01:27:07.220 --> 01:27:09.740]   if you look at the entirety of the network of Twitter,
[01:27:09.740 --> 01:27:12.780]   that might be an organism that this,
[01:27:12.780 --> 01:27:15.580]   the organism understands what's happening
[01:27:15.580 --> 01:27:20.140]   from its level of perception.
[01:27:20.140 --> 01:27:23.740]   But we humans are just like the cells of the human body.
[01:27:23.740 --> 01:27:25.460]   We're interacting individually,
[01:27:25.460 --> 01:27:27.540]   but we're not actually aware
[01:27:27.540 --> 01:27:29.180]   of the big picture that's happening.
[01:27:29.180 --> 01:27:30.500]   And we naturally somehow,
[01:27:30.500 --> 01:27:33.380]   or whatever the force that's creating the entirety of this,
[01:27:33.380 --> 01:27:38.380]   whatever one version of it is,
[01:27:38.380 --> 01:27:41.820]   the evolutionary process, like biological evolution,
[01:27:41.820 --> 01:27:42.940]   whatever force that is,
[01:27:42.940 --> 01:27:44.220]   is just creating these greater
[01:27:44.220 --> 01:27:45.980]   and greater level of complexity.
[01:27:45.980 --> 01:27:50.300]   And maybe somehow other kinds of non-human intelligence
[01:27:50.300 --> 01:27:53.580]   are involved that we're calling alien intelligences.
[01:27:53.580 --> 01:27:54.900]   - Yes.
[01:27:54.900 --> 01:27:57.060]   - So just to step back, and we'll come back to AI,
[01:27:57.060 --> 01:27:58.900]   'cause I love the topic,
[01:27:58.900 --> 01:28:02.820]   but through American Cosmic, and in general,
[01:28:02.820 --> 01:28:05.260]   you've interacted with much of the UFO community.
[01:28:05.260 --> 01:28:08.380]   You mentioned ufologists.
[01:28:08.380 --> 01:28:12.580]   By the way, is it ufologists, or is it ufologists?
[01:28:12.580 --> 01:28:13.580]   - It's ufologists.
[01:28:13.580 --> 01:28:14.620]   - Ufologists. - Which is, yeah.
[01:28:14.620 --> 01:28:17.500]   - So first of all, what is a ufologist?
[01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:19.700]   And second of all,
[01:28:19.700 --> 01:28:23.740]   what have you learned about this community of ufologists,
[01:28:23.740 --> 01:28:27.900]   or also as you refer to them as the invisibles,
[01:28:27.900 --> 01:28:30.700]   or the members of the invisible college,
[01:28:30.700 --> 01:28:32.860]   or just in general, people who study UFOs
[01:28:32.860 --> 01:28:36.660]   from all the different kinds of groups that study UFOs?
[01:28:36.660 --> 01:28:37.500]   - Sure.
[01:28:37.500 --> 01:28:41.940]   Generally, what I found is that they are, okay,
[01:28:41.940 --> 01:28:43.460]   so people who are interested in UFOs
[01:28:43.460 --> 01:28:46.980]   from being a kid and seeing some cool movie
[01:28:46.980 --> 01:28:48.020]   like "Star Wars" or something,
[01:28:48.020 --> 01:28:49.460]   and then they become interested,
[01:28:49.460 --> 01:28:52.220]   and then they study it as best they can,
[01:28:52.220 --> 01:28:54.540]   UFOs or UAPs,
[01:28:54.540 --> 01:28:57.740]   they're generally an honest group of people
[01:28:57.740 --> 01:28:59.780]   who are using their tools.
[01:28:59.780 --> 01:29:01.940]   There are generally two types of them.
[01:29:01.940 --> 01:29:04.940]   There are those who believe in the nuts and bolts,
[01:29:04.940 --> 01:29:06.340]   like the physical craft,
[01:29:06.340 --> 01:29:10.100]   and they believe that these are things from other planets.
[01:29:10.100 --> 01:29:13.480]   Okay, so that's like the ETH hypothesis.
[01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:17.820]   I'm sorry, ETH hypothesis.
[01:29:17.820 --> 01:29:19.260]   E-T-H is what we call it.
[01:29:19.260 --> 01:29:20.900]   Yeah, sorry about that.
[01:29:20.900 --> 01:29:23.020]   - So this is like there's an actual spaceship,
[01:29:23.020 --> 01:29:26.940]   like something akin, but much more advanced
[01:29:26.940 --> 01:29:28.460]   than the rockets we use now.
[01:29:28.460 --> 01:29:30.420]   - Yeah, they have advanced, yeah.
[01:29:30.420 --> 01:29:34.060]   - Some kind of, not necessarily biological,
[01:29:34.060 --> 01:29:36.020]   but something like biological organisms
[01:29:36.020 --> 01:29:38.380]   that travel on these spaceships.
[01:29:38.380 --> 01:29:40.140]   - So this would be like what, to you,
[01:29:40.140 --> 01:29:42.900]   the Stars Academy is trying to decipher.
[01:29:42.900 --> 01:29:45.020]   Like how do they do it?
[01:29:45.020 --> 01:29:46.860]   Maybe we could use that technology,
[01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:48.780]   the propulsion and things like that.
[01:29:48.780 --> 01:29:50.900]   They look at the rocket technology.
[01:29:50.900 --> 01:29:52.180]   Okay, so there are those.
[01:29:52.180 --> 01:29:53.500]   And then there are people who believe
[01:29:53.500 --> 01:29:56.020]   that it's more consciousness-based, okay?
[01:29:56.020 --> 01:30:00.740]   So these are your two types of ufologists who are known,
[01:30:00.740 --> 01:30:02.780]   and these are people who we know about.
[01:30:02.780 --> 01:30:06.420]   Then I found that there are people who are, quote unquote,
[01:30:06.420 --> 01:30:07.900]   I call them the invisibles,
[01:30:07.900 --> 01:30:11.180]   because Jacques Vallée in the '70s,
[01:30:11.180 --> 01:30:14.700]   he and I think actually Alan Hynek, his colleague,
[01:30:14.700 --> 01:30:17.460]   quoted, this is a Francis Bacon thing, by the way.
[01:30:17.460 --> 01:30:20.180]   It goes back to the early modern time period
[01:30:20.180 --> 01:30:21.860]   when scientists could be killed
[01:30:21.860 --> 01:30:24.140]   for basically trying to go outside
[01:30:24.140 --> 01:30:27.140]   what the church or the government institution
[01:30:27.140 --> 01:30:29.380]   determined was dogma.
[01:30:29.380 --> 01:30:31.180]   And so they had to be really careful.
[01:30:31.180 --> 01:30:33.580]   So he called it the invisible college.
[01:30:33.580 --> 01:30:37.580]   So Hynek took that term and reused it,
[01:30:37.580 --> 01:30:39.860]   or what do you call it, repurposed it.
[01:30:39.860 --> 01:30:41.020]   So he repurposed it.
[01:30:41.020 --> 01:30:44.300]   So they were still talking to each other, though.
[01:30:44.300 --> 01:30:45.540]   So what I found to be the case
[01:30:45.540 --> 01:30:47.340]   was that there was a group of people
[01:30:47.340 --> 01:30:51.340]   who were scientists but were not on the internet.
[01:30:51.340 --> 01:30:55.260]   You know, people today, and students of mine in particular,
[01:30:55.260 --> 01:30:57.220]   and my own kids, actually,
[01:30:57.220 --> 01:30:59.940]   they think that you only exist if you're on the internet,
[01:30:59.940 --> 01:31:01.980]   or something only exists if it's on the internet,
[01:31:01.980 --> 01:31:03.740]   and that's, of course, untrue.
[01:31:03.740 --> 01:31:06.340]   And so what I found was that most people
[01:31:06.340 --> 01:31:08.660]   who are the most powerful people of our society
[01:31:08.660 --> 01:31:10.700]   and are doing things are not on the internet,
[01:31:10.700 --> 01:31:12.620]   and you're not gonna find any trace of them.
[01:31:12.620 --> 01:31:16.700]   So a lot of these people are what I call invisibles,
[01:31:16.700 --> 01:31:19.860]   people who are studying, at least their work is invisible.
[01:31:19.860 --> 01:31:21.140]   You might find them on the internet,
[01:31:21.140 --> 01:31:23.020]   but you're gonna find that they're part of the bowling league
[01:31:23.020 --> 01:31:23.940]   or something like that, right?
[01:31:23.940 --> 01:31:26.980]   You will not find that they are actually engaged
[01:31:26.980 --> 01:31:29.780]   in research about this topic, okay?
[01:31:29.780 --> 01:31:31.900]   And so I called them the invisibles
[01:31:31.900 --> 01:31:33.460]   'cause I was surprised to find them.
[01:31:33.460 --> 01:31:36.620]   And I thought, well, this is no longer the invisible college
[01:31:36.620 --> 01:31:38.820]   because these people are not even talking to each other.
[01:31:38.820 --> 01:31:42.700]   And that's why I reference this movie "Fight Club."
[01:31:42.700 --> 01:31:45.260]   In it, you have an invisible, okay?
[01:31:45.260 --> 01:31:49.340]   And his name is Tyler Durden, and he's incredible.
[01:31:49.340 --> 01:31:50.860]   He does incredible things.
[01:31:50.860 --> 01:31:55.220]   He's like a person who should not exist, right?
[01:31:55.220 --> 01:31:57.980]   Because he does so many things that are amazing.
[01:31:57.980 --> 01:32:00.340]   And so I found a person like that, and I call,
[01:32:00.340 --> 01:32:01.980]   and he's a real person.
[01:32:01.980 --> 01:32:03.540]   He's partially on the internet,
[01:32:03.540 --> 01:32:07.140]   but nothing that he does around that topic of UFOs
[01:32:07.140 --> 01:32:08.020]   is on the internet.
[01:32:08.020 --> 01:32:11.500]   So I decided to call him Tyler D after Tyler Durden.
[01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:15.100]   And so these people, I've termed the UFO Fight Club
[01:32:15.100 --> 01:32:18.980]   because they work together, but they don't know.
[01:32:18.980 --> 01:32:20.820]   In fact, his boss doesn't know what he does.
[01:32:20.820 --> 01:32:22.180]   They don't talk to each other
[01:32:22.180 --> 01:32:24.860]   because you know the first rule of "Fight Club."
[01:32:24.860 --> 01:32:26.180]   - Same as the second, yeah.
[01:32:26.180 --> 01:32:27.220]   - Exactly, yeah.
[01:32:27.220 --> 01:32:28.060]   - You don't talk about "Fight Club."
[01:32:28.060 --> 01:32:29.780]   - No, you don't do it.
[01:32:29.780 --> 01:32:34.780]   - Why do you have a sense that there's such a,
[01:32:34.780 --> 01:32:35.820]   I don't wanna say fear,
[01:32:35.820 --> 01:32:38.220]   but a principle of staying out of the limelight?
[01:32:38.220 --> 01:32:40.660]   - I think there's something real.
[01:32:40.660 --> 01:32:44.780]   And I think that the use of it could be dangerous
[01:32:44.780 --> 01:32:45.780]   for people.
[01:32:45.780 --> 01:32:47.540]   - Oh, sorry, you mean something real,
[01:32:47.540 --> 01:32:50.100]   like there's actual technology,
[01:32:50.100 --> 01:32:53.060]   I don't know, what's the right terminology here to use?
[01:32:53.060 --> 01:32:58.020]   Alien technology, ideas about technology
[01:32:58.020 --> 01:33:02.020]   that are being explored, that are dangerous,
[01:33:02.020 --> 01:33:04.900]   have made public, that may become dangerous,
[01:33:04.900 --> 01:33:05.740]   have made public.
[01:33:05.740 --> 01:33:09.020]   - Yes, so you don't have to call it alien technology.
[01:33:09.020 --> 01:33:11.620]   You can call it ideas about alien technology
[01:33:11.620 --> 01:33:14.420]   because I don't know if it's actual alien technology
[01:33:14.420 --> 01:33:15.940]   or not, I honestly don't know.
[01:33:15.940 --> 01:33:19.780]   But I do know for a fact, because it's a historical fact,
[01:33:19.780 --> 01:33:24.700]   that Jack Parsons and Konstantin Tchaikovsky,
[01:33:24.700 --> 01:33:27.260]   who's Russian, believed in these things
[01:33:27.260 --> 01:33:29.740]   and believed that they were downloading this information.
[01:33:29.740 --> 01:33:31.540]   Whether or not they were, I don't,
[01:33:31.540 --> 01:33:34.220]   I mean, they definitely created the rocket technologies.
[01:33:34.220 --> 01:33:35.860]   That's true.
[01:33:35.860 --> 01:33:38.540]   How they did and whether their process
[01:33:38.540 --> 01:33:41.220]   was exactly what they said it was, I don't know.
[01:33:41.220 --> 01:33:42.580]   So this is the same thing today.
[01:33:42.580 --> 01:33:45.820]   So we've got some powerful technologies going on here.
[01:33:45.820 --> 01:33:48.500]   And of course we have a military,
[01:33:48.500 --> 01:33:50.500]   and we have a military for a reason.
[01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:53.740]   Almost every government who needs a military has one.
[01:33:53.740 --> 01:33:57.140]   And so they're going to keep these
[01:33:57.140 --> 01:33:59.780]   the way they should be kept, in my interpretation.
[01:33:59.780 --> 01:34:01.260]   I mean, think about it.
[01:34:01.260 --> 01:34:03.580]   Everybody accepts the fact that we have a military.
[01:34:03.580 --> 01:34:04.660]   Almost everybody does.
[01:34:04.660 --> 01:34:06.340]   Why are they so upset, then,
[01:34:06.340 --> 01:34:09.300]   that the military keeps secrets?
[01:34:09.300 --> 01:34:11.140]   - Yeah, well, that's the nature of things.
[01:34:11.140 --> 01:34:12.780]   We can get into that whole thing.
[01:34:12.780 --> 01:34:17.940]   I tend to, I've spoken with the CTO, Lockheed Martin,
[01:34:17.940 --> 01:34:18.780]   on this.
[01:34:18.780 --> 01:34:23.820]   I obviously read and think about war a lot.
[01:34:23.820 --> 01:34:25.820]   It's such a difficult question,
[01:34:25.820 --> 01:34:29.820]   because this space, this particular space of technology,
[01:34:29.820 --> 01:34:34.700]   there's a gray area that I think is evolving over time.
[01:34:34.700 --> 01:34:37.620]   I think nuclear weapons change the game
[01:34:37.620 --> 01:34:40.540]   in terms of what should and shouldn't be secret.
[01:34:40.540 --> 01:34:42.300]   I think there's already technology
[01:34:42.300 --> 01:34:45.820]   that will enable us to destroy each other.
[01:34:45.820 --> 01:34:48.660]   And so there's some sense in which some technology
[01:34:48.660 --> 01:34:49.580]   should be made public.
[01:34:49.580 --> 01:34:51.140]   This is the same discussion of,
[01:34:51.140 --> 01:34:56.380]   between companies, which part of your technology
[01:34:56.380 --> 01:34:59.620]   should you make public through, for example,
[01:34:59.620 --> 01:35:02.380]   academic publications and all that kind of stuff.
[01:35:02.380 --> 01:35:04.220]   Like how the Google search engine works,
[01:35:04.220 --> 01:35:08.100]   PageRank algorithm, or how the different deep learning,
[01:35:08.100 --> 01:35:11.500]   there's pretty vibrant machine learning research communities
[01:35:11.500 --> 01:35:13.620]   within Google, Facebook, and so on.
[01:35:13.620 --> 01:35:15.940]   And they release a lot of different ideas.
[01:35:15.940 --> 01:35:17.260]   It's an interesting question,
[01:35:17.260 --> 01:35:20.980]   like how dangerous is it to release some of the ideas?
[01:35:20.980 --> 01:35:24.540]   I think it's a gray area that's constantly changing.
[01:35:24.540 --> 01:35:27.500]   I do also think it's super interesting,
[01:35:27.500 --> 01:35:30.360]   I wonder if you could elaborate on it a little bit,
[01:35:30.360 --> 01:35:35.360]   that there's this gray area between what's actually real
[01:35:36.700 --> 01:35:41.220]   in terms of alien technology and the belief of it
[01:35:41.220 --> 01:35:45.780]   when held in the minds of really brilliant people,
[01:35:45.780 --> 01:35:49.420]   that they ultimately may produce the same kind of result
[01:35:49.420 --> 01:35:54.280]   in terms of being able to create new technologies
[01:35:54.280 --> 01:35:55.900]   that are human usable.
[01:35:55.900 --> 01:36:04.120]   Is there, in your mind, they're one and the same?
[01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:07.220]   Is like believing in alien craft
[01:36:07.220 --> 01:36:12.140]   and actually being in possession of an alien craft?
[01:36:12.140 --> 01:36:13.980]   - I don't think they're the same, no.
[01:36:13.980 --> 01:36:15.860]   Belief is powerful, okay?
[01:36:15.860 --> 01:36:21.920]   In new age communities, people think thoughts are things,
[01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:23.480]   okay, that's been said.
[01:36:23.480 --> 01:36:25.660]   Thoughts are things, you can make them happen kind of thing,
[01:36:25.660 --> 01:36:27.000]   believe in them enough.
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:32.000]   It is true that if I believe I can run a 540 mile,
[01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:35.420]   I'll do it, okay, and I probably will do it.
[01:36:35.420 --> 01:36:37.780]   And I've done it before actually.
[01:36:37.780 --> 01:36:39.080]   Much younger, but I did it.
[01:36:39.080 --> 01:36:40.980]   (laughing)
[01:36:40.980 --> 01:36:43.780]   But my coach is the one that instilled that belief in me.
[01:36:43.780 --> 01:36:48.060]   But can I run like a one minute mile?
[01:36:48.060 --> 01:36:49.620]   No, okay?
[01:36:49.620 --> 01:36:52.020]   So I guess, does that answer your question?
[01:36:52.020 --> 01:36:56.020]   There's only so far belief goes in generating reality.
[01:36:56.020 --> 01:36:58.260]   - Well, yeah, I mean, I guess that's what,
[01:36:58.260 --> 01:37:00.860]   just having listened to Jacques Vallee,
[01:37:00.860 --> 01:37:05.860]   it seemed like reality was not as important
[01:37:05.860 --> 01:37:08.100]   for the scientific exploration
[01:37:08.100 --> 01:37:10.940]   of the concept of alien technology.
[01:37:10.940 --> 01:37:11.760]   - I could be wrong,
[01:37:11.760 --> 01:37:13.780]   but this is what I think Jacques is getting at.
[01:37:13.780 --> 01:37:18.060]   There are other ways to access places in reality
[01:37:18.060 --> 01:37:20.680]   other than what we consider to be physical.
[01:37:20.680 --> 01:37:21.940]   - Right.
[01:37:21.940 --> 01:37:23.580]   - There's consciousness, okay?
[01:37:23.580 --> 01:37:27.400]   So like I said, so religious studies is,
[01:37:27.400 --> 01:37:31.240]   among other things, it's looking at visionary experiences.
[01:37:31.240 --> 01:37:33.400]   All right, so people do have visionary experiences.
[01:37:33.400 --> 01:37:35.080]   They did without drugs.
[01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:36.720]   You know, they did with drugs.
[01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:37.780]   They do with drugs.
[01:37:37.780 --> 01:37:40.520]   They do, many have them without drugs today.
[01:37:40.520 --> 01:37:43.600]   And oftentimes those visionary experiences
[01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:46.480]   correspond to each other.
[01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:48.800]   Now, how do we make sense of that?
[01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:51.960]   So, you know, do these places actually exist?
[01:37:51.960 --> 01:37:53.860]   In a sense, I think they do.
[01:37:53.860 --> 01:37:56.400]   And so I think that, you know,
[01:37:56.400 --> 01:37:58.480]   let's take that very famous case
[01:37:58.480 --> 01:38:00.740]   of a Virgin Mary apparition in Fatima,
[01:38:00.740 --> 01:38:02.720]   where I think there was like a lot of people,
[01:38:02.720 --> 01:38:04.160]   thousands and thousands,
[01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:06.560]   if not like I think 50,000 or something like that,
[01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:09.920]   a lot of people gathered to see
[01:38:09.920 --> 01:38:13.000]   what's now called the miracle of Fatima,
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000]   which was the spinning of the sun.
[01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.940]   Well, a lot of people saw different things,
[01:38:17.940 --> 01:38:20.160]   but they all saw some kind of thing.
[01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:21.880]   Okay, so they all saw different things,
[01:38:21.880 --> 01:38:25.760]   but it was, something happened, okay?
[01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:28.520]   So I guess the question is,
[01:38:28.520 --> 01:38:33.480]   what are these places where we access
[01:38:33.480 --> 01:38:38.560]   what I'd call like non-physical realities, okay?
[01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:40.640]   Where we actually do get information.
[01:38:40.640 --> 01:38:42.200]   Like who could say that Jack Parsons
[01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:44.200]   didn't get information from doing these rituals
[01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:45.340]   and accessing these?
[01:38:45.340 --> 01:38:47.760]   We have to say that he actually did,
[01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:50.200]   because we see the results of physical results.
[01:38:50.200 --> 01:38:51.240]   The same thing with Tyler,
[01:38:51.240 --> 01:38:54.440]   and that's why I put Tyler in this camp
[01:38:54.440 --> 01:38:56.880]   with this tradition with Jack Parsons.
[01:38:56.880 --> 01:39:00.920]   I say that Tyler is getting these,
[01:39:00.920 --> 01:39:02.360]   what he calls downloads,
[01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:05.560]   and you can see the results of them physically.
[01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:06.640]   He sells them on the NASDAQ.
[01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:08.520]   He makes millions of dollars from them.
[01:39:08.520 --> 01:39:09.800]   They help people.
[01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:13.120]   I've seen people who they've helped, okay?
[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:14.180]   So.
[01:39:14.180 --> 01:39:18.000]   - Do you think psychedelics that I just mentioned earlier
[01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:21.480]   have a possibility of going
[01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:24.340]   to these kind of,
[01:39:24.340 --> 01:39:29.340]   same kind of places of exploring ideas
[01:39:29.340 --> 01:39:31.280]   that are outside of our
[01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:35.720]   more commonplace understanding of the world?
[01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:39.560]   - Yeah, I think so, absolutely.
[01:39:39.560 --> 01:39:42.560]   However, I think we have to be really careful about those,
[01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:46.440]   because young people, or people in general, I should say,
[01:39:46.440 --> 01:39:48.320]   absolutely can get hurt by them.
[01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:50.200]   I mean, but we get hurt by alcohol.
[01:39:50.200 --> 01:39:53.360]   You know, we drive our cars, and we kill each other.
[01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:55.440]   But psychedelics are really interesting,
[01:39:55.440 --> 01:39:59.800]   because I know that within the history of our country,
[01:39:59.800 --> 01:40:04.440]   we have used psychedelics in various capacities
[01:40:04.440 --> 01:40:08.920]   for our military in order to try to stimulate ideas
[01:40:08.920 --> 01:40:11.240]   and access places and information
[01:40:11.240 --> 01:40:13.720]   that can't be accessed normally.
[01:40:13.720 --> 01:40:15.600]   This is all fact.
[01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:18.320]   - Yeah, I talked to Matt for like four hours,
[01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:20.040]   so we ran out of time being able to talk.
[01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:22.720]   But I wanted to talk to him about MKUltra
[01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:25.120]   and Ted Kaczynski.
[01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:27.120]   There's so many mysterious things there.
[01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:30.920]   There's like layers of what's known or what's not known.
[01:40:30.920 --> 01:40:33.160]   It's fascinating, but I think what is interesting
[01:40:33.160 --> 01:40:37.000]   is psychedelics were used, or were attempted to be used,
[01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.880]   as tools of different kinds.
[01:40:39.880 --> 01:40:40.720]   That's the point.
[01:40:40.720 --> 01:40:43.680]   So like, we think of technology as tools
[01:40:43.680 --> 01:40:47.240]   to enable us to do things.
[01:40:47.240 --> 01:40:52.000]   In that same way that psychedelics, like many drugs,
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.720]   could be used as tools, some more effective than others.
[01:40:54.720 --> 01:40:55.560]   - Absolutely.
[01:40:55.560 --> 01:40:56.400]   - I don't think what you,
[01:40:56.400 --> 01:41:00.440]   I'm not sure what you can do effectively with alcohol.
[01:41:00.440 --> 01:41:03.520]   Although, I think somebody commented somewhere
[01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:07.960]   on social media that, I don't know why everyone gives,
[01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:10.120]   it's so negative about alcohol,
[01:41:10.120 --> 01:41:13.400]   because I think the person said that,
[01:41:13.400 --> 01:41:16.440]   "It's given me some of the most incredible,
[01:41:16.440 --> 01:41:19.680]   "it enabled me to let go
[01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:21.840]   "and have some of the most incredible experiences
[01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:23.240]   "with friends in my life."
[01:41:23.240 --> 01:41:24.080]   And it's true.
[01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:26.880]   We kind of sometimes say alcohol is dangerous,
[01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:27.840]   it can make you do horrible,
[01:41:27.840 --> 01:41:32.840]   but the reality is it's also a fascinating tool
[01:41:32.840 --> 01:41:37.200]   for letting go of trying to be somebody maybe
[01:41:37.200 --> 01:41:40.160]   that you're not, and allowing you to be yourself fully
[01:41:40.160 --> 01:41:42.240]   in whatever crazy form that is,
[01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:44.160]   and allow you to have really deep
[01:41:44.160 --> 01:41:46.560]   and interesting experiences with those you love.
[01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:50.960]   So, yeah, even alcohol can be used as an effective tool
[01:41:50.960 --> 01:41:53.920]   for exploring experiences and becoming,
[01:41:53.920 --> 01:41:57.600]   expanding your mind and becoming a better person.
[01:41:57.600 --> 01:42:01.480]   So, what the hell was I talking about?
[01:42:01.480 --> 01:42:02.800]   (Rachel laughs)
[01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:07.120]   So yeah, so psychedelics and, oh yeah, and MKUltra.
[01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:08.480]   Is there something interesting to say
[01:42:08.480 --> 01:42:13.040]   in our historical use of psychedelics?
[01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:14.120]   I mean, think about it.
[01:42:14.120 --> 01:42:15.800]   When did we start doing that?
[01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:17.280]   When did we start using those?
[01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:18.120]   - That's true.
[01:42:18.120 --> 01:42:20.240]   It's quite a long time ago, right?
[01:42:20.240 --> 01:42:22.000]   - But, okay, but true.
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.400]   But when did our government start experimenting
[01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:26.040]   with them with us?
[01:42:26.040 --> 01:42:26.860]   Okay.
[01:42:26.860 --> 01:42:28.280]   - Our government is the United States government.
[01:42:28.280 --> 01:42:29.120]   - Yeah.
[01:42:29.120 --> 01:42:33.320]   Okay, so that happened in around the 1950s, okay?
[01:42:33.320 --> 01:42:36.200]   After quote unquote the 1940s,
[01:42:36.200 --> 01:42:41.200]   where we have 47 and we have this Roswell type stuff
[01:42:42.280 --> 01:42:45.360]   going on, okay, like crash sites and things like that.
[01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:50.360]   So, I think that, I think there might be a correlation there.
[01:42:50.360 --> 01:42:52.480]   I don't know what it is, okay?
[01:42:52.480 --> 01:42:53.320]   But I do think--
[01:42:53.320 --> 01:42:55.000]   - That's fascinating, actually, yeah.
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.400]   A lot of interesting things started--
[01:42:57.400 --> 01:42:58.640]   - Around that time period. - Around that time, yeah.
[01:42:58.640 --> 01:43:01.880]   - Yeah, and so Aldous Huxley would say,
[01:43:01.880 --> 01:43:04.240]   "We opened the doors of perception," okay?
[01:43:04.240 --> 01:43:05.720]   And what flew in?
[01:43:05.720 --> 01:43:08.720]   (both laugh)
[01:43:08.720 --> 01:43:10.520]   - Oh, man, that was beautifully put.
[01:43:11.480 --> 01:43:13.160]   It'd be interesting to get your opinions
[01:43:13.160 --> 01:43:16.680]   on certain more concrete sightings
[01:43:16.680 --> 01:43:20.480]   that are sort of monumental sightings
[01:43:20.480 --> 01:43:25.320]   of alien intelligences in the history,
[01:43:25.320 --> 01:43:26.160]   in the recent history,
[01:43:26.160 --> 01:43:28.040]   that at least I'm aware of.
[01:43:28.040 --> 01:43:32.440]   I'm not very much aware of this history,
[01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:34.560]   but the most recent one,
[01:43:34.560 --> 01:43:38.280]   I've spoken with David Fravor on this podcast.
[01:43:38.280 --> 01:43:39.680]   I really like him as a person.
[01:43:39.680 --> 01:43:43.040]   He's a fun guy, but also he's gotten a chance to,
[01:43:43.040 --> 01:43:46.600]   he's described his account of having experience
[01:43:46.600 --> 01:43:50.960]   with what he and others now term the Tic Tac UFO.
[01:43:50.960 --> 01:43:53.640]   What do you think of that particular sighting,
[01:43:53.640 --> 01:43:56.280]   which has captivated the imagination of many,
[01:43:56.280 --> 01:43:59.800]   in particular because there's been videos released of it,
[01:43:59.800 --> 01:44:03.480]   of these UFOs, but I find the videos
[01:44:03.480 --> 01:44:07.080]   to be way too blurry and grainy to be of interest to me,
[01:44:07.080 --> 01:44:10.760]   the personally, to me, the most fascinating thing
[01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:14.000]   is the first person to comment from David
[01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.680]   and others about that experience.
[01:44:16.680 --> 01:44:18.480]   But what are your thoughts?
[01:44:18.480 --> 01:44:20.000]   - Those videos have been out for a while,
[01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:24.520]   actually much, I think in the mid 2000s, they were out.
[01:44:24.520 --> 01:44:28.720]   But what you have is you have kind of like this corroboration
[01:44:28.720 --> 01:44:32.120]   from a group and also the New York Times involvement
[01:44:32.120 --> 01:44:33.960]   in 2017.
[01:44:33.960 --> 01:44:36.080]   My opinion about the Tic Tacs is that
[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:40.560]   first, I believe the people who have had the experiences,
[01:44:40.560 --> 01:44:43.280]   I know some of them, like some of the radar people
[01:44:43.280 --> 01:44:45.480]   and things like that, they'd saw them
[01:44:45.480 --> 01:44:48.520]   and they're not, I don't believe they're making it up.
[01:44:48.520 --> 01:44:53.520]   I do think that this is being used as a spin.
[01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:55.400]   And I'm just gonna say that.
[01:44:55.400 --> 01:44:57.040]   And the reason I think that is this,
[01:44:57.040 --> 01:44:59.240]   is because at the time it was released,
[01:44:59.240 --> 01:45:01.280]   I was still in touch with many people
[01:45:01.280 --> 01:45:04.120]   who were among the UFO Fight Club.
[01:45:04.120 --> 01:45:06.800]   And so they had intimate knowledge of these things.
[01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:08.680]   And the first thing they said was,
[01:45:08.680 --> 01:45:13.280]   "We have satellites that can read the news on your phone
[01:45:13.280 --> 01:45:14.440]   when you're reading it.
[01:45:14.440 --> 01:45:17.080]   So we've got better footage than this,
[01:45:17.080 --> 01:45:19.480]   and this is not good footage at all."
[01:45:19.480 --> 01:45:22.320]   Therefore, they believe that it was authentic footage
[01:45:22.320 --> 01:45:23.880]   that had been doctored up.
[01:45:23.880 --> 01:45:26.200]   Now, why?
[01:45:26.200 --> 01:45:27.320]   I don't know why.
[01:45:27.320 --> 01:45:31.280]   So I honestly don't know if it's accurate or not.
[01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:33.600]   I mean, I believe the people, absolutely.
[01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:37.720]   But was this something out there to fool these people?
[01:45:37.720 --> 01:45:39.560]   Perhaps, I don't know.
[01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:41.160]   Is it spun?
[01:45:41.160 --> 01:45:43.920]   The people who I know who are part of the UFO Fight Club
[01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:45.680]   believed it was real, okay?
[01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:48.840]   And said, "This is badly done, but real."
[01:45:48.840 --> 01:45:49.680]   Okay?
[01:45:49.680 --> 01:45:50.720]   - I see, but so there's some kind of,
[01:45:50.720 --> 01:45:52.960]   when you say spinning, there's some parties involved
[01:45:52.960 --> 01:45:56.480]   that are trying to leverage it from the-
[01:45:56.480 --> 01:45:58.080]   - For funds, probably.
[01:45:58.080 --> 01:45:59.520]   - For funds or financial interest.
[01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:00.480]   - Yeah, I think so.
[01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:05.040]   Nevertheless, it has inspired a conversation
[01:46:05.040 --> 01:46:09.520]   and just a lot of people in the world
[01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:13.360]   that there's something mysterious out there
[01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:16.760]   that we're not fully informed about.
[01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:19.120]   - And I was certainly grateful that the New York Times
[01:46:19.120 --> 01:46:22.000]   ran the story right before my book came out.
[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:23.840]   - Well, see, but there's the financial interest
[01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:27.520]   that, to me, as a person who doesn't give a damn
[01:46:27.520 --> 01:46:29.620]   about money, actually, I don't like money,
[01:46:30.600 --> 01:46:35.480]   except for when it's used in the context of a company
[01:46:35.480 --> 01:46:37.380]   to build cool things.
[01:46:37.380 --> 01:46:39.200]   But personally, I don't know.
[01:46:39.200 --> 01:46:43.080]   I find the financial interest side off-putting,
[01:46:43.080 --> 01:46:46.680]   especially when we're talking about the exploration
[01:46:46.680 --> 01:46:47.720]   of some of the most,
[01:46:47.720 --> 01:46:51.440]   like money is a silly creation of human beings.
[01:46:51.440 --> 01:46:52.340]   - I agree.
[01:46:52.340 --> 01:46:57.160]   - And it's used to provide temporary,
[01:46:58.480 --> 01:47:00.800]   the unfortunate thing with money is that
[01:47:00.800 --> 01:47:05.800]   it helps you buy things that too easily allow you
[01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:10.560]   to forget the important things in life
[01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:13.560]   and also to forget the difficult aspects of life,
[01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:15.280]   to do the difficult intellectual work
[01:47:15.280 --> 01:47:17.160]   of being cognizant of your own mortality,
[01:47:17.160 --> 01:47:21.360]   of fully engaging in life,
[01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:23.520]   in a life of reason too,
[01:47:23.520 --> 01:47:25.160]   of thinking deeply about the world,
[01:47:25.160 --> 01:47:26.440]   all those kinds of things.
[01:47:26.440 --> 01:47:28.560]   If you get a nice car or something like that
[01:47:28.560 --> 01:47:30.480]   and just, I don't know,
[01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:33.080]   all the different things you can do with money,
[01:47:33.080 --> 01:47:34.360]   it can make you forget that.
[01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:37.760]   Anyway, there's a long way to say that,
[01:47:37.760 --> 01:47:40.800]   yes, yes, it's very nice that it coincided nicely
[01:47:40.800 --> 01:47:43.100]   with the book, but also,
[01:47:43.100 --> 01:47:47.160]   I think it, I mean, like I said,
[01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:49.760]   I think it inspired quite a lot of people that,
[01:47:49.760 --> 01:47:52.720]   maybe there's a lot of things out there that were,
[01:47:52.720 --> 01:47:54.080]   like it reminded a lot of people,
[01:47:54.080 --> 01:47:56.600]   there's things out there we don't know about.
[01:47:56.600 --> 01:47:58.560]   - Lex, I can agree with you on that,
[01:47:58.560 --> 01:48:00.720]   but can I push back on two things?
[01:48:00.720 --> 01:48:01.560]   - Okay. - Let's do it.
[01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:03.040]   - All right, the first one is that
[01:48:03.040 --> 01:48:05.920]   I was happy to receive money from the book
[01:48:05.920 --> 01:48:07.720]   because of the New York Times article.
[01:48:07.720 --> 01:48:09.200]   That's absolutely false.
[01:48:09.200 --> 01:48:11.400]   So I published my book with Oxford,
[01:48:11.400 --> 01:48:12.840]   which is an academic press,
[01:48:12.840 --> 01:48:15.900]   and you don't get paid with an academic press, okay?
[01:48:15.900 --> 01:48:17.840]   So money was not it for me.
[01:48:17.840 --> 01:48:19.320]   What it was was recognition
[01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:21.760]   that my research was being validated.
[01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:24.440]   So, 'cause then people called me and said,
[01:48:24.440 --> 01:48:26.840]   "Well, maybe it's more than interesting," okay?
[01:48:26.840 --> 01:48:27.920]   And they did, okay.
[01:48:27.920 --> 01:48:31.960]   The other thing about money is just as you say that,
[01:48:31.960 --> 01:48:36.000]   now I agree with you, I'm upset about money too.
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.960]   I think there should be universal healthcare,
[01:48:38.960 --> 01:48:40.520]   a universal income,
[01:48:40.520 --> 01:48:41.880]   I don't think people should be in poverty,
[01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:45.960]   especially because we are so wealthy as a species, frankly.
[01:48:45.960 --> 01:48:48.680]   Okay, that said, think about this.
[01:48:48.680 --> 01:48:51.640]   If you are, if you don't have money,
[01:48:51.640 --> 01:48:54.520]   you can't have a life of the mind either, right?
[01:48:54.520 --> 01:48:58.000]   - 100%, so I'm not espousing that money's the devil.
[01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.560]   I just think that there is,
[01:49:00.560 --> 01:49:04.640]   money can be a drug,
[01:49:04.640 --> 01:49:07.920]   or I would compare it to food or something like that,
[01:49:07.920 --> 01:49:11.720]   where you really should have enough to nourish yourself.
[01:49:11.720 --> 01:49:12.720]   - Yes. - Right?
[01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:14.520]   And-- - Too much could--
[01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:17.160]   - And too much can be a huge problem.
[01:49:17.160 --> 01:49:19.420]   So that's where I come from with money,
[01:49:19.420 --> 01:49:20.760]   and I'm just aware.
[01:49:20.760 --> 01:49:23.960]   I'm fortunate enough to have the skills and the health
[01:49:23.960 --> 01:49:27.880]   to be able to earn a living in whatever way,
[01:49:27.880 --> 01:49:29.960]   like I wish of having being in the United States,
[01:49:29.960 --> 01:49:31.140]   of being able to speak English,
[01:49:31.140 --> 01:49:33.800]   so at the very least I could work at McDonald's.
[01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:37.440]   And my standards are, I told you, I made a mistake.
[01:49:37.440 --> 01:49:42.680]   I told you, Rogan, that I've always had a few money,
[01:49:42.680 --> 01:49:44.360]   and people are like, oh, Lex was always rich.
[01:49:44.360 --> 01:49:46.860]   No, no, no, I was always broke.
[01:49:46.860 --> 01:49:50.320]   What I mean by I've always had a few money
[01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:53.960]   is my standard of what it takes to have a few
[01:49:53.960 --> 01:49:55.240]   is always very little.
[01:49:55.240 --> 01:49:57.440]   I'm just happy with very little.
[01:49:57.440 --> 01:50:01.400]   But yes, it's true that money for many people,
[01:50:01.400 --> 01:50:04.480]   including for myself, it's just a different level
[01:50:04.480 --> 01:50:06.880]   for different people, is freedom.
[01:50:06.880 --> 01:50:08.520]   - Yes, absolutely. - Freedom to think,
[01:50:08.520 --> 01:50:11.400]   freedom to pursue your passions.
[01:50:11.400 --> 01:50:14.760]   It just so happens, I am very fortunate
[01:50:14.760 --> 01:50:18.200]   that many of my passions often come with a salary,
[01:50:18.200 --> 01:50:19.560]   if I wished. - Right.
[01:50:19.560 --> 01:50:23.200]   - So everything, I love programming.
[01:50:23.200 --> 01:50:27.960]   So even just working as a basic level software engineer
[01:50:27.960 --> 01:50:29.920]   will be a source of a lot of joy for me,
[01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:32.840]   and that happens in this modern world
[01:50:32.840 --> 01:50:34.320]   to come with a salary.
[01:50:34.320 --> 01:50:36.520]   So yeah, it's definitely true.
[01:50:36.520 --> 01:50:38.880]   I just mean that it can become a dangerous drug.
[01:50:38.880 --> 01:50:43.880]   So I'm glad you are in this pursuit that you are in
[01:50:43.880 --> 01:50:48.920]   for the love of knowledge, but it's true.
[01:50:48.920 --> 01:50:50.600]   - Yes, so-- - People should definitely
[01:50:50.600 --> 01:50:52.200]   buy your book. (laughs)
[01:50:52.200 --> 01:50:53.840]   - I won't be making money off of it.
[01:50:53.840 --> 01:50:55.920]   - Oh yeah, this rocks, yeah.
[01:50:55.920 --> 01:50:56.760]   Absolutely.
[01:50:56.760 --> 01:50:58.120]   - Maybe my next book. (laughs)
[01:50:58.120 --> 01:51:02.040]   - Yes, yeah, your sense is there's something,
[01:51:02.040 --> 01:51:07.600]   there's some groups of people
[01:51:07.600 --> 01:51:12.600]   that may be trying to leverage this for financial gains.
[01:51:12.600 --> 01:51:14.600]   - And you know, probably good financial,
[01:51:14.600 --> 01:51:17.000]   I mean, they may have good reasons for this too.
[01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:20.160]   Like, okay, let's take the study of UFOs, okay?
[01:51:20.160 --> 01:51:22.520]   Maybe many people in government
[01:51:22.520 --> 01:51:25.720]   that decide who dole out the money, let's put it that way,
[01:51:25.720 --> 01:51:27.780]   they think UFOs aren't real.
[01:51:27.780 --> 01:51:30.160]   So they're not going to give these programs money.
[01:51:30.160 --> 01:51:32.080]   So how do these programs make money?
[01:51:32.080 --> 01:51:34.640]   They're gonna have to find a way to do it.
[01:51:34.640 --> 01:51:36.960]   So maybe that's how they do it, okay?
[01:51:36.960 --> 01:51:38.320]   So I-- - That's fascinating.
[01:51:38.320 --> 01:51:41.800]   This is a way to raise money for--
[01:51:41.800 --> 01:51:43.880]   - Doing the research, yeah, I think so.
[01:51:45.020 --> 01:51:47.900]   - So let's take a step back to Roswell,
[01:51:47.900 --> 01:51:49.260]   we talked about a little bit.
[01:51:49.260 --> 01:51:51.700]   What's your sense about that whole time?
[01:51:51.700 --> 01:51:56.700]   Roswell and just Area 51 and the sightings,
[01:51:56.700 --> 01:52:01.580]   and also the follow-on mythology around those sightings.
[01:52:01.580 --> 01:52:03.780]   That's with us today.
[01:52:03.780 --> 01:52:05.740]   - All right, so-- (laughs)
[01:52:05.740 --> 01:52:07.300]   - Where do I get started?
[01:52:07.300 --> 01:52:10.260]   - Well, I mean, it is a mythology here, right?
[01:52:10.260 --> 01:52:13.300]   The mythology of Roswell, it's very religious-like
[01:52:13.300 --> 01:52:15.220]   in the sense that there's a pilgrimage
[01:52:15.220 --> 01:52:18.500]   to Roswell people make, and they go to,
[01:52:18.500 --> 01:52:22.860]   there's a festival there as well, like a religious festival.
[01:52:22.860 --> 01:52:24.500]   You could get little kitschy stuff
[01:52:24.500 --> 01:52:26.660]   like you can get at a religious festival there.
[01:52:26.660 --> 01:52:29.180]   So it's very much like a place of pilgrimage
[01:52:29.180 --> 01:52:30.620]   where a hierophany occurred,
[01:52:30.620 --> 01:52:33.420]   and a hierophany is basically contact
[01:52:33.420 --> 01:52:35.540]   with non-human intelligence, okay?
[01:52:35.540 --> 01:52:38.740]   So non-human intelligence is thought to have contacted
[01:52:38.740 --> 01:52:42.620]   humans or crashed at this place in Roswell, New Mexico.
[01:52:42.620 --> 01:52:45.900]   Now, what's fascinating is that I begin my book
[01:52:45.900 --> 01:52:48.780]   by going out to a crash site in New Mexico.
[01:52:48.780 --> 01:52:52.340]   I have to get blindfolded with my,
[01:52:52.340 --> 01:52:54.180]   well, to tell you the truth,
[01:52:54.180 --> 01:52:58.540]   the story is that I'm with Tyler, who's an invisible,
[01:52:58.540 --> 01:53:00.940]   and he wants to show me a place in New Mexico
[01:53:00.940 --> 01:53:04.140]   where a crash happened, and he says that he thinks
[01:53:04.140 --> 01:53:06.500]   that I need to see physical evidence
[01:53:06.500 --> 01:53:08.020]   because I don't believe.
[01:53:08.020 --> 01:53:09.780]   And so I said, "I'll go,
[01:53:09.780 --> 01:53:11.260]   "but I'm gonna bring a friend of mine."
[01:53:11.460 --> 01:53:12.940]   And he said, "No, you have to go alone."
[01:53:12.940 --> 01:53:17.420]   He goes, "It's a place that is on government-owned property,
[01:53:17.420 --> 01:53:19.380]   "and it's a no-fly zone,
[01:53:19.380 --> 01:53:21.860]   "and when you go, you'll be blindfolded."
[01:53:21.860 --> 01:53:25.060]   And I said, "I definitely need to bring a friend."
[01:53:25.060 --> 01:53:27.580]   (both laughing)
[01:53:27.580 --> 01:53:29.780]   So he said, "Well, who do you wanna bring?"
[01:53:29.780 --> 01:53:32.980]   I just had met this university scientist
[01:53:32.980 --> 01:53:36.100]   who's very well-known, and I call him James in my book.
[01:53:36.100 --> 01:53:38.420]   And I asked, and I had a feeling James
[01:53:38.420 --> 01:53:40.100]   would definitely wanna do this.
[01:53:40.100 --> 01:53:43.220]   And I asked James, and he said, "I'll go tomorrow."
[01:53:43.220 --> 01:53:45.100]   So I suggested this to Tyler,
[01:53:45.100 --> 01:53:48.300]   and Tyler said, "Absolutely not."
[01:53:48.300 --> 01:53:50.740]   And I thought, "I know he's gonna look up James,
[01:53:50.740 --> 01:53:52.140]   "and he's gonna say yes,
[01:53:52.140 --> 01:53:55.340]   "because if anybody can figure out what this material is
[01:53:55.340 --> 01:53:57.660]   "that we're gonna go look for, it's gonna be James.
[01:53:57.660 --> 01:53:58.900]   "He has the instruments."
[01:53:58.900 --> 01:54:01.740]   And so Tyler did, in fact, look him up,
[01:54:01.740 --> 01:54:04.620]   and finally said, "Okay, I got, you can go."
[01:54:04.620 --> 01:54:06.580]   So we both head out there, and we get blindfolded,
[01:54:06.580 --> 01:54:07.900]   and Tyler takes us out there.
[01:54:07.900 --> 01:54:10.020]   It takes about 40 minutes.
[01:54:10.020 --> 01:54:11.820]   Outside of a certain place in New Mexico.
[01:54:11.820 --> 01:54:14.140]   So in terms of Roswell, this is what I can say,
[01:54:14.140 --> 01:54:16.100]   is that according to Tyler,
[01:54:16.100 --> 01:54:19.980]   there were about seven crashes out in the 1940s
[01:54:19.980 --> 01:54:22.820]   in New Mexico, in various places.
[01:54:22.820 --> 01:54:28.660]   We went to one of them, according to Tyler.
[01:54:28.660 --> 01:54:31.220]   At the time, I was completely an atheist
[01:54:31.220 --> 01:54:33.780]   with regard to anything that had to do with UFOs.
[01:54:33.780 --> 01:54:34.800]   So we were out there.
[01:54:34.800 --> 01:54:39.380]   We had specially configured metal detectors
[01:54:39.380 --> 01:54:43.820]   for these metals, and we did find these, okay?
[01:54:43.820 --> 01:54:47.380]   And they've since been studied by various scientists,
[01:54:47.380 --> 01:54:49.220]   material scientists, so forth.
[01:54:49.220 --> 01:54:52.900]   And I believe Jacques talked about,
[01:54:52.900 --> 01:54:57.820]   not those particular ones, but others on the Joe Rogan show.
[01:54:57.820 --> 01:55:01.140]   There are anomalies, so there are,
[01:55:01.140 --> 01:55:03.820]   we scientists don't, I'm not a scientist,
[01:55:03.820 --> 01:55:06.900]   so I can't weigh in on whether,
[01:55:06.900 --> 01:55:09.980]   I just believe the people, these people I believe,
[01:55:09.980 --> 01:55:12.900]   because they're well-known scientists.
[01:55:12.900 --> 01:55:14.660]   - What do you mean they're not anomalies?
[01:55:14.660 --> 01:55:17.420]   - No, they are anomalous.
[01:55:17.420 --> 01:55:19.460]   - Oh, anomalous in terms of the materials
[01:55:19.460 --> 01:55:22.860]   that are naturally occurring on Earth.
[01:55:22.860 --> 01:55:23.700]   - Yes.
[01:55:23.700 --> 01:55:30.220]   - Okay, so there's some kind of inklings of evidence
[01:55:30.220 --> 01:55:35.580]   that something happened in Roswell,
[01:55:35.980 --> 01:55:40.380]   in terms of crashes of alien technology.
[01:55:40.380 --> 01:55:42.900]   Now, what else is there to the mythology?
[01:55:42.900 --> 01:55:46.420]   So there's some crashes, right?
[01:55:46.420 --> 01:55:48.300]   I mean, that's kind of epic.
[01:55:48.300 --> 01:55:50.100]   - It's pretty epic, yeah.
[01:55:50.100 --> 01:55:52.460]   - And what else?
[01:55:52.460 --> 01:55:55.820]   Like, what are we supposed to take away from this?
[01:55:55.820 --> 01:55:57.860]   - Right, yeah, so it's weird.
[01:55:57.860 --> 01:56:01.260]   Okay, so there's this, okay, so in religious studies,
[01:56:01.260 --> 01:56:03.140]   like I said, we call it a hierophany,
[01:56:03.140 --> 01:56:06.260]   which is the meeting of a non-human intelligent thing,
[01:56:06.260 --> 01:56:09.380]   whatever it is, an angel, a god, whatever, a goddess,
[01:56:09.380 --> 01:56:13.900]   with, or an alien, with humans, and that's the place, okay?
[01:56:13.900 --> 01:56:15.620]   So the place is New Mexico.
[01:56:15.620 --> 01:56:20.620]   So New Mexico becomes folded into the mythology
[01:56:20.620 --> 01:56:24.580]   of this new religion, is what I call a new type of religion,
[01:56:24.580 --> 01:56:28.060]   of the UFO, and it becomes ground zero
[01:56:28.060 --> 01:56:30.220]   for this new mythology.
[01:56:30.220 --> 01:56:34.380]   Just like Mecca is the place where Muslims go,
[01:56:34.380 --> 01:56:36.580]   they have to go, right, at least once in their lives,
[01:56:36.580 --> 01:56:38.100]   it's a pilgrimage place now.
[01:56:38.100 --> 01:56:41.380]   So this is, so in my book, that's how I tell it.
[01:56:41.380 --> 01:56:44.260]   Now, what about Roswell in the public imagination?
[01:56:44.260 --> 01:56:49.140]   Obviously, according to Annie Jacobson, who's good,
[01:56:49.140 --> 01:56:52.380]   you know, she's a great author, investigative journalist,
[01:56:52.380 --> 01:56:53.980]   she's written about Roswell too.
[01:56:53.980 --> 01:56:56.440]   I don't agree with all of what she comes up with,
[01:56:56.440 --> 01:56:58.900]   but part of it is that there's a lot of military stuff
[01:56:58.900 --> 01:57:01.100]   going on there that is classified,
[01:57:01.100 --> 01:57:03.060]   and there's a reason why you can't get in,
[01:57:03.060 --> 01:57:05.220]   and nor would you want to, right?
[01:57:05.220 --> 01:57:09.740]   So there's a lot of experimentation going on there.
[01:57:09.740 --> 01:57:14.580]   I don't believe that it has to do with ETs, frankly,
[01:57:14.580 --> 01:57:19.340]   but in the imaginations of Americans, Roswell is that place.
[01:57:19.340 --> 01:57:21.220]   But I went to a different place,
[01:57:21.220 --> 01:57:23.660]   and apparently there are several places in New Mexico.
[01:57:23.660 --> 01:57:27.220]   Now, strangely enough, I traveled back to New Mexico
[01:57:27.220 --> 01:57:29.740]   at the very end chapter of my book,
[01:57:29.740 --> 01:57:33.220]   but it's not, I don't go there physically.
[01:57:33.220 --> 01:57:38.020]   I go there through the story of a Catholic nun
[01:57:38.020 --> 01:57:42.100]   who actually believes that she bi-located to New Mexico
[01:57:42.100 --> 01:57:46.940]   in the, gosh, in the 1600s.
[01:57:46.940 --> 01:57:48.940]   So she, yeah, it was very strange.
[01:57:48.940 --> 01:57:52.180]   And I was at the Vatican at the space observatory
[01:57:52.180 --> 01:57:53.260]   when I made that connection,
[01:57:53.260 --> 01:57:55.380]   that she probably went to the very,
[01:57:55.380 --> 01:57:57.580]   well, she believed she went to this very place
[01:57:57.580 --> 01:57:59.100]   that I had gone. (laughs)
[01:57:59.100 --> 01:58:01.620]   - Can you elaborate on it a little bit?
[01:58:01.620 --> 01:58:04.220]   Like, what does it mean to go to that place?
[01:58:04.220 --> 01:58:06.460]   - For her? - Yeah, for her.
[01:58:06.460 --> 01:58:11.460]   I mean, so we're kind of breaking down the barrier
[01:58:11.460 --> 01:58:15.900]   between what it means to be at a place and time, right?
[01:58:15.900 --> 01:58:17.860]   - Right, I agree with you.
[01:58:17.860 --> 01:58:19.620]   This is the field of religious studies.
[01:58:19.620 --> 01:58:23.100]   So, and again, I don't say it's true in my book.
[01:58:23.100 --> 01:58:25.500]   I just say it's a very strange coincidence
[01:58:25.500 --> 01:58:28.740]   that I'm at the Vatican observatory.
[01:58:28.740 --> 01:58:30.500]   In fact, I'd finished my book,
[01:58:30.500 --> 01:58:32.980]   but while I was at the Vatican observatory,
[01:58:32.980 --> 01:58:34.420]   I was there with Tyler.
[01:58:34.420 --> 01:58:37.380]   And we were looking at the records,
[01:58:37.380 --> 01:58:38.640]   they're called the trial records,
[01:58:38.640 --> 01:58:41.940]   but they're the canonization records of these two saints.
[01:58:41.940 --> 01:58:44.380]   Each was said to have done amazing things.
[01:58:44.380 --> 01:58:48.500]   One was Joseph of Cupertino, who levitated, okay?
[01:58:48.500 --> 01:58:50.420]   Or is said to have levitated.
[01:58:50.420 --> 01:58:54.020]   The other was Maria of Agrada from Spain.
[01:58:54.020 --> 01:58:56.020]   They're contemporaries in the 1600s,
[01:58:56.020 --> 01:58:58.460]   who was said to have been able to bilocate,
[01:58:58.460 --> 01:59:00.860]   which is to be in two places at once, okay?
[01:59:00.860 --> 01:59:02.820]   So this is a belief in Catholicism
[01:59:02.820 --> 01:59:05.660]   that certain very holy people can do these kinds of things,
[01:59:05.660 --> 01:59:07.540]   like levitate, which by the way,
[01:59:07.540 --> 01:59:10.460]   is also associated with UFO abductions.
[01:59:10.460 --> 01:59:12.620]   You know, people get levitated out of their beds
[01:59:12.620 --> 01:59:13.620]   and things like that.
[01:59:13.620 --> 01:59:16.700]   So we were sent there by a billionaire
[01:59:16.700 --> 01:59:21.260]   who was interested in levitation and bilocation.
[01:59:21.260 --> 01:59:24.140]   And since I could get in to the Vatican
[01:59:24.140 --> 01:59:28.300]   and I knew the director of the Vatican observatory,
[01:59:28.300 --> 01:59:31.860]   both Tyler and I were able to go to the secret archives
[01:59:31.860 --> 01:59:33.540]   and look at the canonization records,
[01:59:33.540 --> 01:59:36.860]   and then go to Castle Gandolfo,
[01:59:36.860 --> 01:59:38.580]   which is about an hour from the Vatican,
[01:59:38.580 --> 01:59:40.260]   where the first observatory,
[01:59:40.260 --> 01:59:44.220]   the space observatory of the Vatican is.
[01:59:44.220 --> 01:59:45.740]   The second one is in Arizona
[01:59:45.740 --> 01:59:47.860]   and it has a much larger telescope.
[01:59:47.860 --> 01:59:52.860]   So we went and Brother Guy gave me the keys to the archive.
[01:59:52.860 --> 01:59:54.140]   He said, "Look at anything you want."
[01:59:54.140 --> 01:59:56.900]   And I got to see a lot of stuff by Carl Sagan, by the way.
[01:59:56.900 --> 01:59:59.020]   I know you talked about, yeah, it was awesome.
[01:59:59.020 --> 02:00:01.220]   So they have a whole section on extraterrestrial,
[02:00:01.220 --> 02:00:03.260]   the search for extraterrestrial life.
[02:00:03.260 --> 02:00:04.460]   And they don't, by the way.
[02:00:04.460 --> 02:00:05.340]   - How awesome is that?
[02:00:05.340 --> 02:00:06.620]   - It was awesome, yeah.
[02:00:06.620 --> 02:00:07.620]   So we got to stay there.
[02:00:07.620 --> 02:00:09.340]   They have a scholar's quarters.
[02:00:09.340 --> 02:00:10.980]   And so they had two.
[02:00:10.980 --> 02:00:13.580]   And so Tyler stayed in one and I stayed in the other.
[02:00:13.580 --> 02:00:17.220]   And Brother Guy probably shouldn't have been so nice to me
[02:00:17.220 --> 02:00:19.460]   and given me the keys.
[02:00:19.460 --> 02:00:23.100]   Because when I got home, we were there for two weeks.
[02:00:23.100 --> 02:00:25.380]   When I got home, I got this frantic phone call from him.
[02:00:25.380 --> 02:00:27.500]   And he basically said, "Diana," he goes,
[02:00:27.500 --> 02:00:30.740]   "Do you remember where you put the original Kepler?"
[02:00:30.740 --> 02:00:33.140]   And so I had this Kepler, right?
[02:00:33.140 --> 02:00:34.980]   And so I misplaced it.
[02:00:34.980 --> 02:00:39.820]   Luckily, I remembered where it went.
[02:00:39.820 --> 02:00:42.100]   I was like, oh gosh, thank goodness I found it.
[02:00:42.100 --> 02:00:44.460]   But he'll probably change the rules
[02:00:44.460 --> 02:00:47.140]   of the Vatican Observatory after my visit.
[02:00:47.140 --> 02:00:52.020]   So Maria is, she's actually in the history of our country
[02:00:52.020 --> 02:00:55.940]   in that she first wrote a cosmography
[02:00:55.940 --> 02:00:59.340]   of what she said was the spinning earth.
[02:00:59.340 --> 02:01:00.820]   And this was in the 1600s.
[02:01:00.820 --> 02:01:02.860]   And that's her first book.
[02:01:02.860 --> 02:01:04.420]   And she wrote that.
[02:01:04.420 --> 02:01:08.700]   And then she said that she was transported
[02:01:08.700 --> 02:01:11.740]   on the wings of angels to the new world.
[02:01:11.740 --> 02:01:16.060]   And she said that she met a culture of people.
[02:01:16.060 --> 02:01:21.060]   And she basically told them about the faith of Catholicism.
[02:01:21.060 --> 02:01:24.820]   And then what happened was that the people that,
[02:01:24.820 --> 02:01:26.580]   and she described the fauna,
[02:01:26.580 --> 02:01:29.580]   she described the people and everything like that.
[02:01:29.580 --> 02:01:32.100]   And so there were actually missionaries there.
[02:01:32.100 --> 02:01:36.940]   And when they went to try to convert
[02:01:36.940 --> 02:01:40.100]   some of the people who already lived there,
[02:01:40.100 --> 02:01:41.980]   apparently they already knew a bunch of stuff.
[02:01:41.980 --> 02:01:43.460]   And they said, how did you know all this stuff?
[02:01:43.460 --> 02:01:47.340]   And they said, this lady in blue came and told us.
[02:01:47.340 --> 02:01:48.740]   And they said, did it look like this?
[02:01:48.740 --> 02:01:49.980]   And they showed them,
[02:01:49.980 --> 02:01:51.940]   they obviously didn't have a photograph,
[02:01:51.940 --> 02:01:55.940]   but they had a picture of a sister, a nun.
[02:01:55.940 --> 02:02:00.220]   And they say, yeah, she wore similar clothes,
[02:02:00.220 --> 02:02:01.980]   but she was much younger, right?
[02:02:01.980 --> 02:02:04.380]   And these guys thought that was weird.
[02:02:04.380 --> 02:02:06.120]   But when they went back to Spain,
[02:02:06.120 --> 02:02:09.820]   they found that this woman had been doing that in her mind,
[02:02:09.820 --> 02:02:11.340]   had been traveling.
[02:02:11.340 --> 02:02:12.820]   - I mean, I don't know what to make of it.
[02:02:12.820 --> 02:02:15.260]   There's so many things that are sort of forcing you
[02:02:15.260 --> 02:02:19.780]   to kind of go outside of, I'm of many minds.
[02:02:19.780 --> 02:02:22.260]   I have a very, most of my days spent
[02:02:22.260 --> 02:02:25.700]   with very rigorous scientific kind of things,
[02:02:25.700 --> 02:02:27.380]   and even engineering kind of things.
[02:02:27.380 --> 02:02:28.980]   And then I'm also open-minded.
[02:02:28.980 --> 02:02:33.980]   And just the entirety of the idea of extraterrestrial life
[02:02:33.980 --> 02:02:39.340]   forces you to think outside of conventional boundaries
[02:02:39.500 --> 02:02:43.100]   of thought, current scientific thought.
[02:02:43.100 --> 02:02:43.980]   Let's put it that way.
[02:02:43.980 --> 02:02:47.020]   And your story right now is certainly an example of that.
[02:02:47.020 --> 02:02:48.780]   - It's freaking you out, but that's okay.
[02:02:48.780 --> 02:02:50.420]   - That's a nice way to put it.
[02:02:50.420 --> 02:02:52.380]   What do you, just another person
[02:02:52.380 --> 02:02:55.540]   that seems to be a key figure in this,
[02:02:55.540 --> 02:02:59.200]   in the mythology of this is Bob Lazar.
[02:02:59.200 --> 02:03:01.140]   It'd be interesting,
[02:03:01.140 --> 02:03:02.820]   maybe there's others you can tell me about,
[02:03:02.820 --> 02:03:06.860]   but Bob, who's also been on Joe Rogan,
[02:03:06.860 --> 02:03:09.860]   but his story has been told quite a bit.
[02:03:09.860 --> 02:03:14.700]   And he's got, I think he said that he witnessed
[02:03:14.700 --> 02:03:19.700]   some of the work being done on the spacecraft
[02:03:19.700 --> 02:03:25.780]   that was captured and so on,
[02:03:25.780 --> 02:03:29.700]   in order to try to reverse engineer some of the technology
[02:03:29.700 --> 02:03:31.480]   in terms of the propulsion and so on.
[02:03:31.480 --> 02:03:33.540]   What are your thoughts about his story,
[02:03:33.540 --> 02:03:37.220]   how it fits into the mythology of this whole thing
[02:03:37.220 --> 02:03:40.820]   and the broader ufologist community?
[02:03:40.820 --> 02:03:43.620]   - Okay, so regarding Bob Lazar,
[02:03:43.620 --> 02:03:46.100]   with respect to his claims,
[02:03:46.100 --> 02:03:50.980]   again, I have no way to adjudicate
[02:03:50.980 --> 02:03:55.980]   whether or not he actually encountered this.
[02:03:55.980 --> 02:03:59.100]   I do have friends who are,
[02:03:59.100 --> 02:04:04.100]   and the people that I know who know his story,
[02:04:04.100 --> 02:04:08.380]   some know him, believe him.
[02:04:08.380 --> 02:04:13.020]   And they have said to me that the most important thing
[02:04:13.020 --> 02:04:15.660]   that they think he has said,
[02:04:15.660 --> 02:04:20.500]   in fact, one of them, I think made a meme out of it
[02:04:20.500 --> 02:04:23.060]   or something like that, was basically, he said,
[02:04:23.060 --> 02:04:28.020]   maybe the public, you know, I regret making it public.
[02:04:28.020 --> 02:04:30.620]   Maybe the public isn't ready for this kind of information.
[02:04:30.620 --> 02:04:35.020]   And basically, they've, they emphasized that to me
[02:04:35.020 --> 02:04:36.700]   and they emphasized it so much
[02:04:36.700 --> 02:04:39.700]   that they wanted me to know, right?
[02:04:39.700 --> 02:04:43.060]   So that is somewhat creepy to me.
[02:04:43.060 --> 02:04:46.860]   So I think, okay, this poor guy, Bob Lazar,
[02:04:46.860 --> 02:04:49.800]   so many people, you know, this is what happens to people
[02:04:49.800 --> 02:04:51.820]   who have experiences like this.
[02:04:51.820 --> 02:04:56.740]   They're questioned, their reputations are put on the line.
[02:04:56.740 --> 02:05:01.380]   In some instances, their reputations are manipulated
[02:05:01.380 --> 02:05:04.820]   on purpose to make them look uncredible.
[02:05:04.820 --> 02:05:09.820]   - To me, as a scientist, it's just inspiring
[02:05:09.820 --> 02:05:13.060]   that it kind of gives this kind of,
[02:05:13.060 --> 02:05:15.700]   I'm not even thinking of it,
[02:05:15.700 --> 02:05:18.540]   is there an actual spacecraft being hidden somewhere
[02:05:18.540 --> 02:05:19.940]   and studied and so on?
[02:05:19.940 --> 02:05:21.940]   I'm thinking of it like, I don't know,
[02:05:21.940 --> 02:05:25.060]   it's a thing that gives you a spark of a dream, you know?
[02:05:26.180 --> 02:05:29.180]   As a reminder that we don't understand
[02:05:29.180 --> 02:05:32.580]   most of how this world works,
[02:05:32.580 --> 02:05:37.100]   and then we can build technologies that aren't here today
[02:05:37.100 --> 02:05:39.140]   that will allow us to understand much more.
[02:05:39.140 --> 02:05:41.580]   And it's kind of like, almost like a feeling
[02:05:41.580 --> 02:05:45.440]   that it provides and that it inspires and makes you dream.
[02:05:45.440 --> 02:05:47.380]   That's the way I see the Bob Lazar story.
[02:05:47.380 --> 02:05:50.220]   I don't necessarily, people ask me, 'cause I'm at MIT,
[02:05:50.220 --> 02:05:53.900]   people ask me, did Bob Lazar actually go to MIT and so on?
[02:05:53.900 --> 02:05:56.000]   I don't know, and I personally don't care.
[02:05:56.720 --> 02:06:01.000]   Like, that's not what's interesting to me about that story.
[02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.800]   To me, the myth is more interesting,
[02:06:03.800 --> 02:06:06.360]   not interesting actually, but inspiring.
[02:06:06.360 --> 02:06:09.280]   - Yes, because inspiring, you're suggesting
[02:06:09.280 --> 02:06:11.840]   that the myth inspires you to create reality.
[02:06:11.840 --> 02:06:12.980]   - Yes. - Yeah.
[02:06:12.980 --> 02:06:15.000]   I think that's true.
[02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:17.280]   - So even if it's like not real--
[02:06:17.280 --> 02:06:19.400]   - It doesn't matter, does it?
[02:06:19.400 --> 02:06:21.320]   - I mean, in some sense, just like you said,
[02:06:21.320 --> 02:06:24.600]   it does, in some sense, it doesn't.
[02:06:25.600 --> 02:06:27.400]   So a lot of people know how much I love
[02:06:27.400 --> 02:06:31.960]   2001, "Space Odyssey," so I got all these emails
[02:06:31.960 --> 02:06:36.960]   asking like, "Hey, bro, do you know what's up
[02:06:36.960 --> 02:06:40.560]   "with the monoliths in the middle of the desert?"
[02:06:40.560 --> 02:06:42.920]   Or whatever it was, I haven't been actually
[02:06:42.920 --> 02:06:45.160]   paying attention, I apologize.
[02:06:45.160 --> 02:06:47.760]   But you kind of mentioned offline
[02:06:47.760 --> 02:06:49.560]   that this was kind of cool and interesting.
[02:06:49.560 --> 02:06:51.280]   What do you make of these monoliths?
[02:06:51.280 --> 02:06:56.280]   And in general, are you a fan of 2001, "Space Odyssey,"
[02:06:56.280 --> 02:06:59.320]   where monoliths showed up?
[02:06:59.320 --> 02:07:00.720]   Do you have any thoughts about either
[02:07:00.720 --> 02:07:02.400]   the science fiction, the mythology of it,
[02:07:02.400 --> 02:07:04.080]   or the reality of it?
[02:07:04.080 --> 02:07:06.520]   - Yes, okay. (laughs)
[02:07:06.520 --> 02:07:09.640]   - No, okay, and please say more.
[02:07:09.640 --> 02:07:13.380]   - Right, so first of all, Kubrick's films
[02:07:13.380 --> 02:07:18.040]   are not ever easy for me because they're so weird, right?
[02:07:18.040 --> 02:07:20.600]   And I don't actually enjoy watching them.
[02:07:20.600 --> 02:07:23.640]   - It's work. - Yeah, it doesn't take away
[02:07:23.640 --> 02:07:26.000]   from their incredible brilliance, though,
[02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:29.360]   and their visionary merit.
[02:07:29.360 --> 02:07:34.360]   So, 2001, "Space Odyssey" is incredibly visionary,
[02:07:34.360 --> 02:07:37.640]   and of course, all those things that people say,
[02:07:37.640 --> 02:07:39.080]   I don't have to restate them.
[02:07:39.080 --> 02:07:42.800]   In terms of what I've, it's a subtext to my book,
[02:07:42.800 --> 02:07:44.600]   by the way, I didn't mean it to be,
[02:07:44.600 --> 02:07:47.480]   but it's almost a character in my book,
[02:07:47.480 --> 02:07:49.380]   "2001, A Space Odyssey."
[02:07:49.380 --> 02:07:52.920]   And when the monoliths started to appear again,
[02:07:52.920 --> 02:07:55.320]   everything went crazy with my everything,
[02:07:55.320 --> 02:07:57.760]   internet, social media, phone, what's up,
[02:07:57.760 --> 02:07:58.960]   what's going on, right?
[02:07:58.960 --> 02:08:00.400]   Is this disclosure?
[02:08:00.400 --> 02:08:02.880]   And I thought, well, you know, I'll tell you one thing,
[02:08:02.880 --> 02:08:05.000]   is it's, let's look at the timing of it.
[02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:07.560]   It's a cool, if it's an art, you know,
[02:08:07.560 --> 02:08:09.800]   and then copy art and things like that,
[02:08:09.800 --> 02:08:12.440]   it's actually happening at a really interesting time
[02:08:12.440 --> 02:08:15.060]   when all of us are forced to go online.
[02:08:15.060 --> 02:08:17.480]   When all of us are forced, because of COVID, right?
[02:08:17.480 --> 02:08:20.140]   We're completely now invaded by the screen,
[02:08:20.140 --> 02:08:21.860]   or we're invading the screen.
[02:08:21.860 --> 02:08:23.900]   Like we're leaving, our infrastructure now
[02:08:23.900 --> 02:08:25.180]   is completely changed.
[02:08:25.180 --> 02:08:28.900]   So the monolith, basically, if art is supposed to,
[02:08:28.900 --> 02:08:31.260]   like show us life, it certainly has.
[02:08:31.260 --> 02:08:32.280]   If that's an art project,
[02:08:32.280 --> 02:08:33.780]   somebody did an awesome job with it.
[02:08:33.780 --> 02:08:36.060]   But apparently that monolith was there for a long time,
[02:08:36.060 --> 02:08:36.900]   right?
[02:08:36.900 --> 02:08:37.720]   I mean, that's the thing,
[02:08:37.720 --> 02:08:38.820]   it's been there for a couple of years.
[02:08:38.820 --> 02:08:40.900]   So they said, okay, all right.
[02:08:40.900 --> 02:08:45.660]   That said, if your audience is interested,
[02:08:45.660 --> 02:08:49.180]   I think the best theory about the meaning of the monolith
[02:08:49.180 --> 02:08:53.980]   is Robert Ager, or Robert Ayer,
[02:08:53.980 --> 02:08:55.380]   I think it's Robert Ager.
[02:08:55.380 --> 02:08:59.580]   He's got a website where he does analyses of films,
[02:08:59.580 --> 02:09:03.280]   and it's called collative learning, or collative learning.
[02:09:03.280 --> 02:09:05.340]   And he does the meaning of the monolith.
[02:09:05.340 --> 02:09:06.780]   Everyone should go look at that,
[02:09:06.780 --> 02:09:08.860]   because I fully agree with him.
[02:09:08.860 --> 02:09:11.900]   When I studied different meanings of the monolith
[02:09:11.900 --> 02:09:14.580]   in 2001, A Space Odyssey, I was fascinated.
[02:09:14.580 --> 02:09:16.060]   Okay, so what is this about?
[02:09:16.060 --> 02:09:21.620]   I accepted as soon as I listened to it, and watched it.
[02:09:21.620 --> 02:09:24.860]   So basically, he says that the monolith is,
[02:09:24.860 --> 02:09:27.620]   okay, can you pick up your phone here?
[02:09:27.620 --> 02:09:28.820]   What does that look like?
[02:09:28.820 --> 02:09:31.660]   (laughing)
[02:09:31.660 --> 02:09:33.260]   - Looks awfully a lot like a monolith.
[02:09:33.260 --> 02:09:34.100]   - Yeah.
[02:09:34.100 --> 02:09:36.020]   Okay, so basically that's what he was saying,
[02:09:36.020 --> 02:09:38.220]   was that Kubrick was basically,
[02:09:38.220 --> 02:09:42.340]   the monolith was technology, or the screen in particular.
[02:09:42.340 --> 02:09:45.660]   And he basically was saying that the cinema screen,
[02:09:45.660 --> 02:09:47.820]   we're being completely, and if you think about it,
[02:09:47.820 --> 02:09:50.100]   look at all this, we live in a screen culture.
[02:09:50.100 --> 02:09:53.340]   We have computer screens, iPhone screens,
[02:09:53.340 --> 02:09:56.420]   or phone screens, we have TV screens,
[02:09:56.420 --> 02:09:59.220]   everything is something, and now that COVID has come,
[02:09:59.220 --> 02:10:01.180]   we're forced to go into these screens,
[02:10:01.180 --> 02:10:04.980]   and we're forced to live a different material existence
[02:10:04.980 --> 02:10:06.580]   than we have lived before.
[02:10:06.580 --> 02:10:10.180]   So in my sense, I think that if it's an art project,
[02:10:10.180 --> 02:10:11.820]   it's a really good one for that.
[02:10:12.780 --> 02:10:17.020]   - So I like that meaning of it, it's a screen,
[02:10:17.020 --> 02:10:20.420]   and a screen can take all kinds of forms.
[02:10:20.420 --> 02:10:22.740]   I mean, our perception system, in a sense,
[02:10:22.740 --> 02:10:27.220]   is a screen between reality and our mind.
[02:10:27.220 --> 02:10:30.340]   The screen of the computer is a screen.
[02:10:30.340 --> 02:10:35.060]   The virtual reality worlds that we might be one day living in,
[02:10:35.060 --> 02:10:37.420]   there will be an interface.
[02:10:37.420 --> 02:10:39.780]   I mean, ultimately, it's about the interface.
[02:10:39.780 --> 02:10:41.300]   That's interesting.
[02:10:41.300 --> 02:10:45.900]   - It's an interface to another world of ideas.
[02:10:45.900 --> 02:10:47.580]   - It's also a material change.
[02:10:47.580 --> 02:10:50.060]   It's a change in our material,
[02:10:50.060 --> 02:10:52.780]   I mean, when people talk about augmented reality,
[02:10:52.780 --> 02:10:56.420]   I say we already live in augmented reality, don't we?
[02:10:56.420 --> 02:11:01.060]   Because this isn't our grandparents' existence.
[02:11:01.060 --> 02:11:05.460]   - Yeah, I sometimes, you have to pause and remind yourself
[02:11:05.460 --> 02:11:08.060]   how weirdly different this reality is
[02:11:08.060 --> 02:11:11.820]   than just even like, I mean, 30 years ago.
[02:11:11.820 --> 02:11:13.420]   The internet changed so much,
[02:11:13.420 --> 02:11:17.060]   and social media has changed so much
[02:11:17.060 --> 02:11:20.980]   about actually just the space of our thinking.
[02:11:20.980 --> 02:11:23.340]   Wikipedia changed so much
[02:11:23.340 --> 02:11:25.820]   about the offloading of our knowledge,
[02:11:25.820 --> 02:11:28.700]   the way we interact with knowledge.
[02:11:28.700 --> 02:11:33.700]   I mean, it offloaded our long-term memory about facts
[02:11:33.700 --> 02:11:35.620]   onto a digital format,
[02:11:35.620 --> 02:11:38.340]   so in a sense, it expanded our mind.
[02:11:38.340 --> 02:11:39.620]   It's kind of interesting.
[02:11:39.620 --> 02:11:44.180]   I'd be curious to see if he has just one interpretation.
[02:11:44.180 --> 02:11:45.020]   I wonder if there's others.
[02:11:45.020 --> 02:11:46.740]   - I've corresponded with him, yes.
[02:11:46.740 --> 02:11:49.740]   So over the years, he and I have corresponded.
[02:11:49.740 --> 02:11:51.220]   And I told him, I said,
[02:11:51.220 --> 02:11:52.940]   "Look, I'm gonna be using this in my book,
[02:11:52.940 --> 02:11:55.220]   "so I think you should read what I say."
[02:11:55.220 --> 02:11:58.860]   And he, of course, wanted to see it. (laughs)
[02:11:58.860 --> 02:12:00.100]   - What did he think about your book?
[02:12:00.100 --> 02:12:01.100]   Did he get a chance to read it?
[02:12:01.100 --> 02:12:01.940]   - Yeah, oh yeah.
[02:12:01.940 --> 02:12:06.940]   So he is a non-believer in alien intelligence and UFOs,
[02:12:06.940 --> 02:12:13.020]   and that's fine, but I still agree with him
[02:12:13.020 --> 02:12:15.460]   that the meaning of the monolith was the screen,
[02:12:15.460 --> 02:12:17.420]   but that doesn't mean the screen isn't
[02:12:17.420 --> 02:12:20.660]   like what David Bowie said, right?
[02:12:20.660 --> 02:12:22.540]   So it's not exclusive.
[02:12:22.540 --> 02:12:24.240]   So I could still use his theory,
[02:12:24.240 --> 02:12:26.820]   but differ from the conclusions.
[02:12:26.820 --> 02:12:28.780]   - In terms of non-believer and believer,
[02:12:31.420 --> 02:12:35.300]   when you say believer, you also are kind of implying
[02:12:35.300 --> 02:12:40.300]   this, that the idea that aliens have visited
[02:12:40.300 --> 02:12:43.720]   or had made direct contact with humans in some form.
[02:12:43.720 --> 02:12:49.820]   There's also the exploration and the idea
[02:12:49.820 --> 02:12:54.820]   of just alien intelligences out there in the universe.
[02:12:54.820 --> 02:12:56.780]   You know, the Drake equation,
[02:12:56.780 --> 02:13:01.380]   estimating how many intelligent civilizations
[02:13:01.380 --> 02:13:03.660]   may be out there, how many have ever existed,
[02:13:03.660 --> 02:13:05.740]   how many are able to communicate with us.
[02:13:05.740 --> 02:13:07.920]   I mean, when you just zoom out
[02:13:07.920 --> 02:13:11.620]   from our own little selfish perspective of Earth
[02:13:11.620 --> 02:13:15.060]   and look at the entirety, let's say the Milky Way galaxy,
[02:13:15.060 --> 02:13:17.560]   but maybe even the universe,
[02:13:17.560 --> 02:13:20.020]   does the idea that there are intelligent civilizations
[02:13:20.020 --> 02:13:24.120]   out there, something that you're excited about
[02:13:24.120 --> 02:13:27.180]   or something that you're terrified about?
[02:13:27.180 --> 02:13:28.780]   - That's a good question.
[02:13:28.780 --> 02:13:33.780]   So basically I would say I'm not so keen on it.
[02:13:33.780 --> 02:13:39.580]   I think that our relationship with technology as it is
[02:13:39.580 --> 02:13:44.580]   and as I hope it will go, will help us survive, okay?
[02:13:44.580 --> 02:13:50.820]   I don't think we're equipped to do it as we stand now,
[02:13:50.820 --> 02:13:54.020]   but I think that if we can up our game
[02:13:54.020 --> 02:13:55.620]   or let's just put it this way,
[02:13:55.620 --> 02:13:58.140]   if technology is an extension of ourselves,
[02:13:58.140 --> 02:14:01.540]   which it actually is, it will help us
[02:14:01.540 --> 02:14:04.020]   because it'll probably be smarter than us, okay?
[02:14:04.020 --> 02:14:05.500]   It'll help us survive in the ways
[02:14:05.500 --> 02:14:07.620]   in which it determines best, okay?
[02:14:07.620 --> 02:14:12.620]   That said, if there are non-human intelligences out there
[02:14:12.620 --> 02:14:17.460]   and they have more advanced, you know,
[02:14:17.460 --> 02:14:20.540]   obviously technologies than us and they actually come,
[02:14:20.540 --> 02:14:27.420]   the history of human engagement with other cultures
[02:14:28.060 --> 02:14:32.580]   has not gone well for cultures that are less aggressive.
[02:14:32.580 --> 02:14:35.180]   So you see what I'm saying?
[02:14:35.180 --> 02:14:37.420]   Like it's not a good idea.
[02:14:37.420 --> 02:14:40.260]   - Well, I wonder where we stand on the,
[02:14:40.260 --> 02:14:43.700]   where humans stand on the full spectrum of aggression.
[02:14:43.700 --> 02:14:45.660]   - Well, heck, where are we now, Lex?
[02:14:45.660 --> 02:14:47.500]   I mean, we're not too great here.
[02:14:47.500 --> 02:14:49.860]   We're still aggressing against each other.
[02:14:49.860 --> 02:14:52.340]   - No, I know, but that will give us a benefit, right?
[02:14:52.340 --> 02:14:57.340]   Like, oh, you're saying, I thought, okay, I see.
[02:14:57.340 --> 02:14:59.420]   I just have a sense that there may be a lot
[02:14:59.420 --> 02:15:03.540]   of intelligences out there that are less aggressive
[02:15:03.540 --> 02:15:06.300]   'cause they've evolved past it.
[02:15:06.300 --> 02:15:08.100]   - We can't assume that.
[02:15:08.100 --> 02:15:10.380]   - No, I know we can't assume that, but like--
[02:15:10.380 --> 02:15:13.300]   - If we can't assume it, then I'm gonna assume the worst.
[02:15:13.300 --> 02:15:15.540]   (both laughing)
[02:15:15.540 --> 02:15:20.540]   - Well, that's, despite the fact that I'm a Russian
[02:15:20.540 --> 02:15:23.860]   and think that life is suffering, I tend to assume,
[02:15:23.860 --> 02:15:26.060]   not the best, but I tend to assume
[02:15:26.060 --> 02:15:31.060]   that there is a best core to creatures,
[02:15:31.060 --> 02:15:35.100]   to people and to creatures that ultimately wins out.
[02:15:35.100 --> 02:15:38.420]   I think there's an evolutionary advantage
[02:15:38.420 --> 02:15:41.600]   to being good to other living creatures.
[02:15:41.600 --> 02:15:46.580]   And so, ultimately, I think that if there's
[02:15:46.580 --> 02:15:48.980]   intelligent civilizations out there
[02:15:48.980 --> 02:15:51.900]   that prosper sufficiently to be able to travel
[02:15:51.900 --> 02:15:56.620]   across the great spans of space,
[02:15:56.620 --> 02:16:01.620]   that they've evolved past silly aggression,
[02:16:01.620 --> 02:16:07.900]   that it's more likely in my mind to be deeply cooperative.
[02:16:07.900 --> 02:16:11.220]   So like growth over destruction.
[02:16:11.220 --> 02:16:15.820]   Like growth does not require destruction, I think.
[02:16:15.820 --> 02:16:19.960]   But if you see the universe as ultimately a place
[02:16:19.960 --> 02:16:22.220]   where it's highly constrained in resources
[02:16:22.220 --> 02:16:27.220]   that are necessary for traveling across space and time,
[02:16:27.220 --> 02:16:30.740]   then perhaps aggression is necessary
[02:16:30.740 --> 02:16:33.780]   in order to aggress against others
[02:16:33.780 --> 02:16:36.860]   that are desiring to get access to those resources.
[02:16:36.860 --> 02:16:37.940]   I don't know.
[02:16:37.940 --> 02:16:41.700]   I tend to try to be optimistic on that front.
[02:16:41.700 --> 02:16:43.580]   - I think I'm emotionally optimistic
[02:16:43.580 --> 02:16:46.820]   and intellectually non-optimistic.
[02:16:46.820 --> 02:16:48.460]   (both laughing)
[02:16:48.460 --> 02:16:50.720]   - Yeah, I guess I'm there with you.
[02:16:50.720 --> 02:16:54.280]   I tend to believe that the happiness
[02:16:54.280 --> 02:16:56.080]   and deep fulfillment in life
[02:16:56.080 --> 02:16:58.020]   is found in that emotional place.
[02:16:58.020 --> 02:17:02.480]   The intellectual place is really useful
[02:17:02.480 --> 02:17:07.480]   for building cool new technologies and ideas and so on.
[02:17:07.480 --> 02:17:10.480]   But happiness is in the emotional place.
[02:17:10.480 --> 02:17:13.380]   And there, it pays off to be optimistic, I think.
[02:17:13.380 --> 02:17:18.380]   You said that technology might be able to save us.
[02:17:18.380 --> 02:17:21.160]   - Yeah, that's also kind of optimistic too.
[02:17:21.160 --> 02:17:22.000]   (both laughing)
[02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:23.440]   It might kill us.
[02:17:23.440 --> 02:17:26.720]   - There's, talking to you offline a little bit,
[02:17:26.720 --> 02:17:29.640]   there was a sense that we humans
[02:17:29.640 --> 02:17:32.720]   are facing existential risks.
[02:17:32.720 --> 02:17:36.140]   That it's not obvious that we will survive for long.
[02:17:36.140 --> 02:17:41.680]   Is there things that you worry about
[02:17:41.680 --> 02:17:44.640]   in terms of ways we may destroy ourselves
[02:17:44.640 --> 02:17:48.980]   or deeply damage the fabric of human civilization
[02:17:48.980 --> 02:17:53.980]   that technology may allow us to avoid or alleviate?
[02:17:53.980 --> 02:18:00.940]   - Yes, I think that any, you can choose anything actually,
[02:18:00.940 --> 02:18:03.520]   and it could destroy us.
[02:18:03.520 --> 02:18:06.360]   Okay, so pollution.
[02:18:06.360 --> 02:18:10.200]   Here we're in a pandemic, okay?
[02:18:10.200 --> 02:18:12.740]   A meteor, okay?
[02:18:12.740 --> 02:18:15.420]   So we can use technology,
[02:18:15.420 --> 02:18:18.780]   or the thing is that we say we use technology,
[02:18:18.780 --> 02:18:21.740]   but actually that's not a correct way of putting it,
[02:18:21.740 --> 02:18:22.960]   in my opinion.
[02:18:22.960 --> 02:18:29.080]   So there is a term used by others,
[02:18:29.080 --> 02:18:30.840]   coined by somebody I don't know,
[02:18:30.840 --> 02:18:33.660]   and I'm sorry to not give credit where credit's due,
[02:18:33.660 --> 02:18:35.700]   but it's called technogenesis.
[02:18:35.700 --> 02:18:37.200]   And it's this idea,
[02:18:37.200 --> 02:18:38.440]   Heidegger actually had this idea,
[02:18:38.440 --> 02:18:39.580]   but he didn't use that term.
[02:18:39.620 --> 02:18:42.780]   And it's this idea that we co-evolve with technology,
[02:18:42.780 --> 02:18:43.940]   that we don't actually use it.
[02:18:43.940 --> 02:18:46.900]   Most people think it's like a tool we use, okay?
[02:18:46.900 --> 02:18:49.340]   Let's use technology to do this.
[02:18:49.340 --> 02:18:52.260]   Well, actually, when we engage with technology,
[02:18:52.260 --> 02:18:53.780]   we actually engage with it,
[02:18:53.780 --> 02:18:57.100]   and it engages back with us, and we engage with it.
[02:18:57.100 --> 02:18:59.340]   So it's this co-evolution that's happening.
[02:18:59.340 --> 02:19:01.100]   And in that sense,
[02:19:01.100 --> 02:19:07.820]   I think that as we create more autonomous, intelligent AI,
[02:19:08.660 --> 02:19:12.060]   it will help us survive,
[02:19:12.060 --> 02:19:17.060]   because if we co-evolve with it,
[02:19:17.060 --> 02:19:20.660]   it will need us as much as we need it, is my opinion.
[02:19:20.660 --> 02:19:25.620]   How that happens, or if that bears out to be true,
[02:19:25.620 --> 02:19:28.060]   we'll see.
[02:19:28.060 --> 02:19:31.180]   But I don't think the idea that we use technology
[02:19:31.180 --> 02:19:32.940]   is a correct way to put it.
[02:19:32.940 --> 02:19:35.580]   I think that technology is something so strange,
[02:19:35.580 --> 02:19:37.620]   the way it is today, like digital technology.
[02:19:37.620 --> 02:19:40.500]   I'm not talking about hammers or things like that,
[02:19:40.500 --> 02:19:42.300]   those kinds of tools, okay?
[02:19:42.300 --> 02:19:45.740]   Is technology is so far removed from that,
[02:19:45.740 --> 02:19:50.260]   and our environment is so now conditioned
[02:19:50.260 --> 02:19:53.220]   by our technology and the infrastructure we live within,
[02:19:53.220 --> 02:19:54.540]   the material structure.
[02:19:54.540 --> 02:19:58.620]   I think that it's going to,
[02:19:58.620 --> 02:20:00.420]   I don't think it's gonna be a Frankenstein.
[02:20:00.420 --> 02:20:01.460]   I think it's actually going,
[02:20:01.460 --> 02:20:03.660]   like a Mary Shelley type idea of technology.
[02:20:03.660 --> 02:20:07.340]   I think it's actually going to be more Promethean
[02:20:07.340 --> 02:20:10.620]   in the sense of, you know, think about it.
[02:20:10.620 --> 02:20:14.020]   We create children, and then we get old,
[02:20:14.020 --> 02:20:17.700]   and we rely upon our children to help us, okay?
[02:20:17.700 --> 02:20:19.540]   Well, I feel like that about technology.
[02:20:19.540 --> 02:20:22.100]   We've created, well, we've created it, right?
[02:20:22.100 --> 02:20:24.540]   And so it's kind of growing up now.
[02:20:24.540 --> 02:20:27.300]   (both laughing)
[02:20:27.300 --> 02:20:32.300]   - Or maybe it's in its teenage years, and we'll see.
[02:20:32.300 --> 02:20:33.940]   We'll see.
[02:20:33.940 --> 02:20:37.180]   What do you think about, in terms of this co-evolution
[02:20:37.180 --> 02:20:41.300]   of the work around brain-computer interfaces
[02:20:41.300 --> 02:20:45.940]   and maybe Neuralink and Elon,
[02:20:45.940 --> 02:20:52.740]   seeing Neuralink in particular as its long-term mission
[02:20:52.740 --> 02:20:56.860]   as a symbiosis with artificial intelligence?
[02:20:56.860 --> 02:21:01.860]   So like giving a greater bandwidth,
[02:21:02.100 --> 02:21:07.100]   channel of communication between technology, AI systems,
[02:21:07.100 --> 02:21:12.460]   and the biological neural networks of our human mind.
[02:21:12.460 --> 02:21:15.580]   What do you think about this idea
[02:21:15.580 --> 02:21:20.580]   of connecting directly to the brain in AI systems?
[02:21:20.580 --> 02:21:25.340]   - I mean, okay, I've listened to your podcast with Elon.
[02:21:25.340 --> 02:21:26.700]   I've listened to Elon before.
[02:21:26.700 --> 02:21:30.020]   He's very intelligent, well, obviously, super smart guy.
[02:21:30.020 --> 02:21:31.700]   I think this is already, I mean,
[02:21:31.700 --> 02:21:35.100]   not in the specific ways that he is doing it,
[02:21:35.100 --> 02:21:37.180]   but I think we are already doing that, okay?
[02:21:37.180 --> 02:21:39.180]   And I can give you some examples.
[02:21:39.180 --> 02:21:42.820]   And there are really trivial examples,
[02:21:42.820 --> 02:21:45.420]   but they do make the point, and this is one of them.
[02:21:45.420 --> 02:21:49.060]   So before he started this research
[02:21:49.060 --> 02:21:52.140]   on UFOs and UAPs and technology,
[02:21:52.140 --> 02:21:56.940]   I actually was looking at the effects of technology
[02:21:56.940 --> 02:22:01.300]   and in particular, media on religion.
[02:22:01.300 --> 02:22:04.740]   And what I did was I was lucky to be asked
[02:22:04.740 --> 02:22:08.580]   to be a consultant for various movies.
[02:22:08.580 --> 02:22:11.860]   And one in particular I learned a lot from,
[02:22:11.860 --> 02:22:13.460]   and that was "The Conjuring."
[02:22:13.460 --> 02:22:17.460]   So I was a history consultant for "The Conjuring."
[02:22:17.460 --> 02:22:19.500]   It happens to be my field.
[02:22:19.500 --> 02:22:20.940]   It's Catholic studies, right?
[02:22:20.940 --> 02:22:23.260]   And you've got these people who are real people
[02:22:23.260 --> 02:22:25.620]   and they're exercising demons and things like that.
[02:22:25.620 --> 02:22:28.820]   Okay, so I thought, wow, this is a great example for me.
[02:22:28.820 --> 02:22:30.420]   You know, I didn't do it for the money.
[02:22:30.420 --> 02:22:33.300]   It doesn't pay well, but I did it to learn, right?
[02:22:33.300 --> 02:22:35.860]   So I work closely with the screenwriters
[02:22:35.860 --> 02:22:37.900]   who I work with now all the time.
[02:22:37.900 --> 02:22:39.860]   I work with them all the time now.
[02:22:39.860 --> 02:22:41.060]   And what I found was this.
[02:22:41.060 --> 02:22:43.340]   I found that the most interesting part
[02:22:43.340 --> 02:22:47.060]   of the creation of this movie was the editing process
[02:22:47.060 --> 02:22:51.180]   because they would use, it would go through editing
[02:22:51.180 --> 02:22:53.180]   and they would use test audiences.
[02:22:53.180 --> 02:22:56.300]   And a lot of the test audiences would be,
[02:22:56.300 --> 02:22:58.420]   like, you know, there's like these things
[02:22:58.420 --> 02:23:00.780]   where they test their flicker rates and things like that,
[02:23:00.780 --> 02:23:01.740]   the eye flicker rates.
[02:23:01.740 --> 02:23:06.100]   And so, and when it goes really intense,
[02:23:06.100 --> 02:23:08.740]   they go to UC Irvine and they do this thing
[02:23:08.740 --> 02:23:12.360]   called cognitive consumption, which is basically,
[02:23:12.360 --> 02:23:16.460]   or I'm sorry, cognitive consumerism,
[02:23:16.460 --> 02:23:20.540]   where they basically hook test audiences up to EKGs
[02:23:20.540 --> 02:23:22.180]   and they read their brains.
[02:23:22.180 --> 02:23:25.540]   And they figure out which scenes create the most-
[02:23:25.540 --> 02:23:26.380]   - Arousal.
[02:23:26.380 --> 02:23:27.220]   - Yeah.
[02:23:27.220 --> 02:23:30.060]   And so they cut out all the other scenes, okay?
[02:23:30.060 --> 02:23:32.500]   So what we're getting is we're getting like this drug
[02:23:32.500 --> 02:23:34.740]   when we go to the movies or when we do video games
[02:23:34.740 --> 02:23:37.740]   or when we watch, we're literally physiologically
[02:23:37.740 --> 02:23:41.020]   responding to our technologies.
[02:23:41.020 --> 02:23:41.940]   So we're already there.
[02:23:41.940 --> 02:23:44.420]   We're already interfacing with them physiologically.
[02:23:44.420 --> 02:23:45.480]   So that's my example.
[02:23:45.480 --> 02:23:48.820]   Now, the kind of thing that he's doing,
[02:23:48.820 --> 02:23:52.460]   Musk is doing with Neuralink, I say, go for it.
[02:23:52.460 --> 02:23:53.280]   That's awesome.
[02:23:53.280 --> 02:23:54.380]   I hope he does it, you know?
[02:23:54.380 --> 02:23:55.660]   I'm fascinated.
[02:23:55.660 --> 02:23:57.460]   I want it to happen.
[02:23:57.460 --> 02:23:58.860]   Why do I want it to happen?
[02:23:58.860 --> 02:24:02.180]   Because I think that, well, first it's inevitable
[02:24:02.180 --> 02:24:03.980]   that it's going to happen.
[02:24:03.980 --> 02:24:05.580]   I also wanna point out that Jacques Vallée
[02:24:05.580 --> 02:24:08.860]   was trying to get this done back in the '60s and the '70s.
[02:24:08.860 --> 02:24:13.860]   He was writing papers about, in fact, the ARPANET,
[02:24:13.860 --> 02:24:17.020]   the proto-internet, was called
[02:24:17.020 --> 02:24:19.800]   augmentation of the human intellect.
[02:24:19.800 --> 02:24:22.320]   So we've been doing this for a while, okay?
[02:24:22.320 --> 02:24:24.980]   So props to Elon Musk,
[02:24:24.980 --> 02:24:27.620]   but we've been thinking about this for a good time.
[02:24:27.620 --> 02:24:30.260]   We've even been visioning it, okay?
[02:24:30.260 --> 02:24:34.860]   So there was a really interesting Jesuit priest.
[02:24:34.860 --> 02:24:37.820]   He was French, Tellier de Chardin.
[02:24:37.820 --> 02:24:39.520]   I don't know if you know who he is.
[02:24:39.520 --> 02:24:41.140]   If not, he's fascinating.
[02:24:41.140 --> 02:24:45.620]   He was actually a soldier before he became a priest.
[02:24:45.620 --> 02:24:47.140]   And so he believed,
[02:24:47.140 --> 02:24:49.820]   he also saw what he called a biosphere.
[02:24:49.820 --> 02:24:52.540]   Now, this guy is talking in like the early 20th century,
[02:24:52.540 --> 02:24:56.220]   like the 1917, that time period.
[02:24:56.220 --> 02:24:58.820]   And so basically he said
[02:24:58.820 --> 02:25:01.340]   and wrote about this thing called the noosphere.
[02:25:01.340 --> 02:25:02.340]   And he basically said,
[02:25:02.340 --> 02:25:05.140]   there will be a point when we merge with our technology
[02:25:05.140 --> 02:25:08.160]   and it's going to be somewhat like some kind of a biosphere.
[02:25:08.160 --> 02:25:09.580]   We have this atmosphere,
[02:25:09.580 --> 02:25:11.260]   and then we have the stratosphere,
[02:25:11.260 --> 02:25:13.280]   and it's gonna be this biosphere,
[02:25:13.280 --> 02:25:16.020]   and we're all gonna be hooked into it mentally.
[02:25:16.020 --> 02:25:18.240]   So we'll be able to communicate
[02:25:18.240 --> 02:25:20.500]   in a way in which we don't communicate now.
[02:25:20.500 --> 02:25:23.820]   So, you know, that sounds so similar to the singularity.
[02:25:23.820 --> 02:25:27.380]   So after I read him many, many years ago,
[02:25:27.380 --> 02:25:32.380]   but when I read the Kurzweil's book about the singularity,
[02:25:32.380 --> 02:25:36.340]   to me, it read just like religious language.
[02:25:36.340 --> 02:25:38.940]   Like it read like, you know, 'cause he,
[02:25:38.940 --> 02:25:43.420]   in fact, it's so much like revelation to me when I read it
[02:25:43.420 --> 02:25:46.060]   that I even assign it to my students in my classes.
[02:25:46.060 --> 02:25:48.100]   I'm like, this is it.
[02:25:48.100 --> 02:25:49.980]   You know, this is like a really great book
[02:25:49.980 --> 02:25:52.860]   of the singularity, you know, the coming singularity,
[02:25:52.860 --> 02:25:56.620]   and this religious event, because it seems like it,
[02:25:56.620 --> 02:25:58.340]   when he writes about it, he says,
[02:25:58.340 --> 02:26:01.220]   "I felt it before I even understood it."
[02:26:01.220 --> 02:26:02.820]   You know? - He, I mean, Kurzweil.
[02:26:02.820 --> 02:26:04.140]   - Kurzweil, yeah, Kurzweil.
[02:26:04.140 --> 02:26:06.140]   - I mean, what are your feelings about,
[02:26:06.140 --> 02:26:09.460]   not feelings, thoughts, feelings too,
[02:26:09.460 --> 02:26:12.660]   about the idea of the singularity?
[02:26:12.660 --> 02:26:14.580]   Do you think it's ultimately the thing
[02:26:14.580 --> 02:26:16.820]   that echoes throughout the history of ideas
[02:26:16.820 --> 02:26:21.820]   is this like moment of revelation,
[02:26:21.820 --> 02:26:27.100]   like this almost mythological religious moment?
[02:26:27.100 --> 02:26:32.140]   Or is there something more physical to this idea of--
[02:26:32.140 --> 02:26:36.860]   - Concrete. - Concrete about the idea of,
[02:26:36.860 --> 02:26:38.900]   there'll come a point where our technology,
[02:26:38.900 --> 02:26:43.900]   there'll be like a phase shift between the basic fabric
[02:26:43.980 --> 02:26:47.460]   of like humanity, of how we interact, you know,
[02:26:47.460 --> 02:26:48.980]   how evolution brought us to be,
[02:26:48.980 --> 02:26:50.380]   this biological interaction,
[02:26:50.380 --> 02:26:55.380]   that our technology crosses some kind of line of capability
[02:26:55.380 --> 02:27:00.100]   that the world be more technology than human
[02:27:00.100 --> 02:27:02.140]   to where it'll leave us behind.
[02:27:02.140 --> 02:27:04.580]   Sort of-- - Oh yeah, I don't think
[02:27:04.580 --> 02:27:05.680]   it's gonna leave us behind.
[02:27:05.680 --> 02:27:07.380]   I think it's gonna take us along.
[02:27:07.380 --> 02:27:10.500]   - But it will be, I mean, I guess the idea
[02:27:10.500 --> 02:27:11.780]   of the singularity, first of all,
[02:27:11.780 --> 02:27:13.500]   isn't the idea of the singularity is like,
[02:27:13.500 --> 02:27:15.620]   we can't possibly predict what's on the other side
[02:27:15.620 --> 02:27:16.900]   of the singularity.
[02:27:16.900 --> 02:27:18.940]   These are the senses like, this is like,
[02:27:18.940 --> 02:27:21.340]   the world will be fundamentally transformed.
[02:27:21.340 --> 02:27:24.820]   - Yes, okay, so right, and then it was, you know,
[02:27:24.820 --> 02:27:26.980]   this was characterized in various movies
[02:27:26.980 --> 02:27:28.780]   like "Lucy" and stuff like that.
[02:27:28.780 --> 02:27:32.580]   Lucy being the first human that, right,
[02:27:32.580 --> 02:27:36.260]   so kind of replicating, this is gonna be the next iteration
[02:27:36.260 --> 02:27:39.180]   of humans is the singularity.
[02:27:39.180 --> 02:27:42.780]   I actually don't believe that, frankly.
[02:27:42.780 --> 02:27:44.820]   However, and the reason I don't believe it
[02:27:44.820 --> 02:27:47.140]   is because we're material beings
[02:27:47.140 --> 02:27:49.800]   and technology has to have a host.
[02:27:49.800 --> 02:27:51.460]   So we're not gonna, you know,
[02:27:51.460 --> 02:27:53.860]   become something super abstract.
[02:27:53.860 --> 02:27:56.340]   Like, it's just impossible to do.
[02:27:56.340 --> 02:27:57.620]   There's nothing like that.
[02:27:57.620 --> 02:27:59.820]   - Well, people will be listening to this podcast
[02:27:59.820 --> 02:28:01.780]   100 years from now and laughing at it
[02:28:01.780 --> 02:28:05.900]   because they'll be all existing in a virtual reality.
[02:28:05.900 --> 02:28:10.540]   We'll be all information as opposed to material,
[02:28:10.540 --> 02:28:14.700]   meaning connected to some kind of concept of physical,
[02:28:14.700 --> 02:28:17.460]   physical reality.
[02:28:17.460 --> 02:28:18.940]   I don't even know the right words to use here.
[02:28:18.940 --> 02:28:20.940]   - No, see, that's because there are none
[02:28:20.940 --> 02:28:23.860]   because there's no place from,
[02:28:23.860 --> 02:28:25.620]   there's no view from nowhere.
[02:28:25.620 --> 02:28:29.220]   There's no non-material, like,
[02:28:29.220 --> 02:28:32.260]   we have thoughts, but they're connected to us, right?
[02:28:32.260 --> 02:28:35.260]   They're in our, you know, they're somehow, okay.
[02:28:35.260 --> 02:28:37.640]   - As far as you know.
[02:28:37.640 --> 02:28:42.640]   Listen, platonic forms, I think, is about as, you know,
[02:28:42.640 --> 02:28:45.580]   close to what we're talking about as possible.
[02:28:45.580 --> 02:28:48.120]   Like, this place where these things exist
[02:28:48.120 --> 02:28:50.600]   and then there's like a physical instantiation of it.
[02:28:50.600 --> 02:28:51.700]   - No, but see, we're,
[02:28:51.700 --> 02:28:57.620]   the question is, from the perspective of the platonic form,
[02:28:57.620 --> 02:29:00.400]   what does our physical world look like?
[02:29:00.400 --> 02:29:01.240]   You know what I'm saying?
[02:29:01.240 --> 02:29:03.920]   Like, you know, if, say you're a creature
[02:29:03.920 --> 02:29:05.240]   existing in a virtual reality,
[02:29:05.240 --> 02:29:08.640]   like, if you grew up your whole life
[02:29:08.640 --> 02:29:11.540]   in a virtual reality game,
[02:29:11.540 --> 02:29:15.840]   like, what is it, and somebody in that virtual reality world
[02:29:15.840 --> 02:29:20.320]   tells you that there actually exists this physical world
[02:29:20.320 --> 02:29:23.120]   and, in fact, your own,
[02:29:23.120 --> 02:29:25.240]   you think you're in this virtual world,
[02:29:25.240 --> 02:29:27.440]   but it's actually, you're in a body
[02:29:27.440 --> 02:29:29.280]   and this is just your mind putting yourself
[02:29:29.280 --> 02:29:31.120]   and there's a piece of technology.
[02:29:31.120 --> 02:29:34.280]   Like, how will they be able to
[02:29:34.280 --> 02:29:35.680]   think of that physical world?
[02:29:35.680 --> 02:29:38.600]   Would they sound exactly like you just sounded
[02:29:38.600 --> 02:29:41.640]   a minute ago saying, like, well, that's silly.
[02:29:41.640 --> 02:29:44.240]   Who cares if there's a physical world?
[02:29:44.240 --> 02:29:48.000]   It's the entirety of the perception
[02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:51.600]   and my memories and all of that
[02:29:51.600 --> 02:29:54.480]   is in this other realm of,
[02:29:54.480 --> 02:29:57.120]   of like, information.
[02:29:57.120 --> 02:29:58.880]   It's just all just information.
[02:29:58.880 --> 02:30:03.200]   Why do I need some kind of weird meat bag to contain?
[02:30:03.200 --> 02:30:06.040]   So, there's a great, again, I always, you know,
[02:30:06.040 --> 02:30:09.320]   return to something for your audience to read or you.
[02:30:09.320 --> 02:30:13.400]   There's a great, very short article online for free
[02:30:13.400 --> 02:30:14.640]   by David Chalmers.
[02:30:14.640 --> 02:30:15.480]   Do you know him?
[02:30:15.480 --> 02:30:17.160]   He's the philosopher of consciousness.
[02:30:17.160 --> 02:30:19.080]   - Yeah, interviewed him on this podcast, yeah.
[02:30:19.080 --> 02:30:20.280]   - Yeah, yeah, he's cool.
[02:30:20.280 --> 02:30:25.240]   I used to, I was friends with his best friend for a while
[02:30:25.240 --> 02:30:27.720]   when I was in grad school.
[02:30:27.720 --> 02:30:29.160]   - He probably has some weird friends.
[02:30:29.160 --> 02:30:30.000]   - He does.
[02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:31.640]   (both laughing)
[02:30:31.640 --> 02:30:33.720]   He's a philosopher, okay?
[02:30:33.720 --> 02:30:34.800]   So.
[02:30:34.800 --> 02:30:37.000]   - I like his fashion choice and his style too.
[02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:37.840]   (Rachel laughing)
[02:30:37.840 --> 02:30:39.400]   I'm gonna hang out with him a little bit.
[02:30:39.400 --> 02:30:40.880]   He's a great guy.
[02:30:40.880 --> 02:30:44.960]   - Okay, so he wrote this article, which I use a lot.
[02:30:44.960 --> 02:30:48.040]   I love it because it's accessible to undergraduates
[02:30:48.040 --> 02:30:50.920]   and it's called "Matrix as Metaphysics."
[02:30:50.920 --> 02:30:55.440]   And basically, it's an answer to external world skepticism,
[02:30:55.440 --> 02:30:56.640]   which is basically,
[02:30:56.640 --> 02:30:58.880]   how do we know there's an external world, right?
[02:30:58.880 --> 02:31:01.360]   How do we know that we're not in a matrix right now?
[02:31:01.360 --> 02:31:04.560]   And so basically, he's using,
[02:31:04.560 --> 02:31:08.160]   he's also, he even references,
[02:31:08.160 --> 02:31:09.880]   he uses a religious reference even.
[02:31:09.880 --> 02:31:13.520]   He says, "You could think of the matrix of the movie
[02:31:13.520 --> 02:31:18.520]   "as the new book of Genesis for our new world," right?
[02:31:18.520 --> 02:31:23.680]   And I thought, yeah, that's absolutely correct
[02:31:23.680 --> 02:31:27.000]   because we don't know
[02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:31.280]   and we won't know for sure or for certain
[02:31:31.280 --> 02:31:34.840]   therefore what we know is what is real to us.
[02:31:34.840 --> 02:31:37.280]   And so he goes through these scenarios
[02:31:37.280 --> 02:31:39.160]   and within philosophy is called,
[02:31:39.160 --> 02:31:41.280]   there's a, this is different from that,
[02:31:41.280 --> 02:31:43.400]   but it's like this brain in a vat, right?
[02:31:43.400 --> 02:31:44.920]   If you're a brain in a vat
[02:31:44.920 --> 02:31:47.640]   and some not so kind scientist
[02:31:47.640 --> 02:31:50.880]   is like recreating this world for you just to see,
[02:31:50.880 --> 02:31:54.040]   and you think you're this awesome rockstar, right?
[02:31:54.040 --> 02:31:55.360]   And you're living this awesome existence
[02:31:55.360 --> 02:31:58.600]   but you're actually just this brain in this vat, okay?
[02:31:58.600 --> 02:32:01.200]   But there's still a brain in a vat, okay?
[02:32:01.200 --> 02:32:05.760]   So his idea in the matrix as metaphysics
[02:32:05.760 --> 02:32:08.760]   kind of takes out the brain in a vat like this.
[02:32:08.760 --> 02:32:10.400]   I don't know if this is possible.
[02:32:10.400 --> 02:32:13.840]   So I've read critiques of this that,
[02:32:13.840 --> 02:32:15.800]   what you're talking about is a non-dualism,
[02:32:15.800 --> 02:32:16.800]   like there's like,
[02:32:16.800 --> 02:32:22.320]   or it's not necessarily a non-dualism.
[02:32:22.320 --> 02:32:28.440]   I just, I mean, information in and of itself
[02:32:29.640 --> 02:32:33.080]   has to have some kind of material component to it.
[02:32:33.080 --> 02:32:36.440]   - I mean, it's that when taking it
[02:32:36.440 --> 02:32:38.080]   outside the realm of human beings,
[02:32:38.080 --> 02:32:42.720]   'cause dualism is kind of talking about humans in a sense,
[02:32:42.720 --> 02:32:45.400]   it's just possible to me that there could be creatures
[02:32:45.400 --> 02:32:49.720]   that exist in a very different form,
[02:32:49.720 --> 02:32:52.440]   perhaps rely on very different set of materials
[02:32:52.440 --> 02:32:57.760]   that may perhaps not even look like materials to us.
[02:32:57.760 --> 02:32:58.800]   - Yes, I agree.
[02:32:58.800 --> 02:33:01.440]   - Which is why like information,
[02:33:01.440 --> 02:33:04.840]   it could be even in computers,
[02:33:04.840 --> 02:33:09.280]   the information that's traveling inside a computer
[02:33:09.280 --> 02:33:14.280]   is connected to actual material movement.
[02:33:14.280 --> 02:33:15.520]   - Right.
[02:33:15.520 --> 02:33:17.840]   - Right, so like it is ultimately connected
[02:33:17.840 --> 02:33:18.800]   to material movement,
[02:33:18.800 --> 02:33:21.160]   but it's less and less about the material
[02:33:21.160 --> 02:33:24.040]   and more and more about the information.
[02:33:24.040 --> 02:33:27.360]   So I just mean that it's possible that--
[02:33:27.360 --> 02:33:29.840]   - Do you think the singularity is basically
[02:33:29.840 --> 02:33:32.960]   like sloughing off our material existence?
[02:33:32.960 --> 02:33:33.800]   - Well, I don't know.
[02:33:33.800 --> 02:33:35.840]   - 'Cause I can tell you that this has been
[02:33:35.840 --> 02:33:39.240]   the hope of philosophers and theologians forever.
[02:33:39.240 --> 02:33:43.360]   - Yeah, well, I think we're living through a singularity.
[02:33:43.360 --> 02:33:46.000]   I don't think, I think this world,
[02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:48.420]   just like as you've said already,
[02:33:48.420 --> 02:33:51.800]   has been already transformed significantly
[02:33:51.800 --> 02:33:53.760]   and keeps continually being transformed.
[02:33:53.760 --> 02:33:54.960]   And we're just riding this--
[02:33:54.960 --> 02:33:55.800]   - Yeah, we are.
[02:33:55.800 --> 02:33:58.920]   - Beautiful wave of transformation.
[02:33:58.920 --> 02:34:03.800]   And that's why it's both exciting and terrifying
[02:34:03.800 --> 02:34:08.440]   from a scientific perspective that like,
[02:34:08.440 --> 02:34:10.600]   we're so bad at predicting the future
[02:34:10.600 --> 02:34:13.600]   and the future is always so amazing
[02:34:13.600 --> 02:34:16.720]   in terms of the things it has brought us.
[02:34:16.720 --> 02:34:19.800]   I mean, I don't know if it's always will be this exciting
[02:34:19.800 --> 02:34:21.960]   in terms of the rate of innovation,
[02:34:21.960 --> 02:34:24.200]   but it seems to be increasing still.
[02:34:24.200 --> 02:34:25.200]   And it's really exciting.
[02:34:25.200 --> 02:34:27.360]   It's exciting to-- - I think so too, yeah.
[02:34:27.360 --> 02:34:29.720]   - It's terrifying because obviously we're building
[02:34:29.720 --> 02:34:32.560]   better and better tools for destroying ourselves.
[02:34:32.560 --> 02:34:34.920]   But I, on the optimistic side,
[02:34:34.920 --> 02:34:38.800]   believe that we also can build better and better tools
[02:34:38.800 --> 02:34:41.840]   to defend against all the ways we can destroy ourselves.
[02:34:41.840 --> 02:34:45.520]   And it's kind of this interesting race of innovation.
[02:34:45.520 --> 02:34:46.360]   - Yeah.
[02:34:46.360 --> 02:34:48.280]   - Books are great.
[02:34:48.280 --> 02:34:50.600]   Of course, the greatest book of all time,
[02:34:50.600 --> 02:34:53.480]   two of the greatest books of all time are yours.
[02:34:53.480 --> 02:34:54.760]   But besides those,
[02:34:54.760 --> 02:35:01.800]   what books, technical, fiction, or philosophical
[02:35:01.800 --> 02:35:05.400]   had an impact on your life
[02:35:05.400 --> 02:35:09.240]   or possibly you think others might want to read
[02:35:09.240 --> 02:35:10.720]   and get some insights from?
[02:35:10.720 --> 02:35:13.160]   And what ideas did you pick up from them?
[02:35:13.160 --> 02:35:14.000]   - Great.
[02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:16.880]   Okay, I really enjoy Nietzsche.
[02:35:16.880 --> 02:35:19.560]   Okay, so anything by Nietzsche, Friedrich Nietzsche.
[02:35:19.560 --> 02:35:20.860]   He's a philosopher.
[02:35:21.760 --> 02:35:24.360]   I actually hated him when I first read him
[02:35:24.360 --> 02:35:25.720]   in my early 20s.
[02:35:25.720 --> 02:35:27.840]   - That's like the opposite of most people's experience.
[02:35:27.840 --> 02:35:28.680]   Right?
[02:35:28.680 --> 02:35:30.440]   They usually love him in their 20s
[02:35:30.440 --> 02:35:33.040]   and then they throw him to the curb.
[02:35:33.040 --> 02:35:34.720]   - Later, yeah. - Later, yeah.
[02:35:34.720 --> 02:35:38.160]   - I think he's totally misrepresented and misinterpreted.
[02:35:38.160 --> 02:35:39.720]   - He grew on you.
[02:35:39.720 --> 02:35:41.360]   - Well, it happened in one night.
[02:35:41.360 --> 02:35:43.760]   So, (laughs)
[02:35:43.760 --> 02:35:45.680]   let me just describe it 'cause it's kind of funny.
[02:35:45.680 --> 02:35:46.920]   It happened on New Year's.
[02:35:46.920 --> 02:35:49.360]   So I had friends when I was in my 20s
[02:35:49.360 --> 02:35:52.000]   and they kept telling me, "You have to read Nietzsche.
[02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:52.840]   You have to read Nietzsche."
[02:35:52.840 --> 02:35:54.520]   And I tried, okay?
[02:35:54.520 --> 02:35:56.920]   But again, no.
[02:35:56.920 --> 02:35:57.760]   I didn't like, (laughs)
[02:35:57.760 --> 02:36:02.040]   was not into how he described the philosophical concepts
[02:36:02.040 --> 02:36:03.440]   he was trying to get across.
[02:36:03.440 --> 02:36:06.240]   So, but they weren't giving up.
[02:36:06.240 --> 02:36:09.160]   I have very persistent friends.
[02:36:09.160 --> 02:36:13.120]   So one of them gave me "The Gay Science"
[02:36:13.120 --> 02:36:18.120]   and I had it on my bookstand and it was New Year's Eve
[02:36:18.720 --> 02:36:20.440]   and I'm actually not a big part,
[02:36:20.440 --> 02:36:22.160]   I'm actually an introvert.
[02:36:22.160 --> 02:36:24.040]   I'm a geeky introvert, okay?
[02:36:24.040 --> 02:36:26.480]   So I don't go out and party a lot.
[02:36:26.480 --> 02:36:27.520]   It was New Year's Eve,
[02:36:27.520 --> 02:36:29.320]   even that couldn't get me out to go party.
[02:36:29.320 --> 02:36:30.760]   So I just wanted to go to bed.
[02:36:30.760 --> 02:36:31.600]   - Yeah.
[02:36:31.600 --> 02:36:34.120]   - And New Year's Eve hit and everybody went out
[02:36:34.120 --> 02:36:36.200]   and I was asleep and they woke me up.
[02:36:36.200 --> 02:36:37.720]   And I was like, "Darn, they woke me up.
[02:36:37.720 --> 02:36:39.760]   Eh, might as well read this book by Nietzsche."
[02:36:39.760 --> 02:36:42.280]   Okay, so I picked it up and lo and behold,
[02:36:42.280 --> 02:36:44.880]   I turned to a page that was exactly about,
[02:36:44.880 --> 02:36:46.920]   it was called "Sanctus Januarius,"
[02:36:46.920 --> 02:36:48.520]   which is basically St. January
[02:36:48.520 --> 02:36:50.600]   and it was about New Year's Eve.
[02:36:50.600 --> 02:36:52.720]   And I thought, "Whoa, what a weird coincidence."
[02:36:52.720 --> 02:36:55.480]   And it was a really, it was also super Catholic.
[02:36:55.480 --> 02:36:58.880]   And it was a really beautiful little aphorism.
[02:36:58.880 --> 02:37:00.640]   It's actually a book of aphorisms,
[02:37:00.640 --> 02:37:02.760]   which are kind of religious, right?
[02:37:02.760 --> 02:37:06.360]   And so it's religious, the genre is religious.
[02:37:06.360 --> 02:37:08.200]   Let's put it that way, but he's not.
[02:37:08.200 --> 02:37:11.120]   So basically he says, "Today is the day
[02:37:11.120 --> 02:37:14.080]   when people are supposed to make these resolutions."
[02:37:14.080 --> 02:37:14.920]   Right?
[02:37:14.920 --> 02:37:19.280]   And he says, "From here on out, I will never say no.
[02:37:19.280 --> 02:37:20.680]   I will only say yes."
[02:37:20.680 --> 02:37:21.880]   Okay, "I look away.
[02:37:21.880 --> 02:37:23.720]   If something's horrible, I'll just look away from it.
[02:37:23.720 --> 02:37:24.880]   I won't get angry at it."
[02:37:24.880 --> 02:37:28.320]   And then he also says, "I will be like St. January."
[02:37:28.320 --> 02:37:30.840]   And St. January is actually the saint
[02:37:30.840 --> 02:37:33.600]   whose blood is in this place in Italy.
[02:37:33.600 --> 02:37:34.800]   I think it's in Italy.
[02:37:34.800 --> 02:37:39.560]   And every year it turns to blood again.
[02:37:39.560 --> 02:37:41.160]   So it's like, it's desiccated.
[02:37:41.160 --> 02:37:42.880]   It's, you know, so it's this miracle.
[02:37:42.880 --> 02:37:47.600]   It says, "My blood is now, it flows again."
[02:37:47.600 --> 02:37:49.240]   And I was like, "Wow, that's really beautiful."
[02:37:49.240 --> 02:37:51.160]   And I said, "And a strange coincidence,"
[02:37:51.160 --> 02:37:54.000]   because it just turned, you know, 12.
[02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:56.760]   So it's like New Year's Eve, I pick up the book,
[02:37:56.760 --> 02:38:00.440]   I read this aphorism, I said, "Strange coincidence that,"
[02:38:00.440 --> 02:38:02.080]   and then I turn the page,
[02:38:02.080 --> 02:38:04.280]   and the page is about coincidences.
[02:38:04.280 --> 02:38:07.760]   And I was like, I shut it, and I thought, "This is weird."
[02:38:07.760 --> 02:38:09.200]   And I felt like it was alive.
[02:38:09.200 --> 02:38:10.400]   I felt like the book was alive
[02:38:10.400 --> 02:38:12.240]   and Nietzsche was speaking to me, right?
[02:38:12.240 --> 02:38:15.320]   I had a like experience and engagement with Nietzsche.
[02:38:15.320 --> 02:38:18.520]   And so after that, I couldn't put his stuff down.
[02:38:18.520 --> 02:38:21.120]   It was engaging, fascinating, everything.
[02:38:21.120 --> 02:38:23.640]   So yeah, so that's one book, "The Gay Science."
[02:38:23.640 --> 02:38:26.440]   - What did you pick up from "The Gay Science"
[02:38:26.440 --> 02:38:27.280]   or from Nietzsche in general?
[02:38:27.280 --> 02:38:28.480]   Is there some ideas that just kind of--
[02:38:28.480 --> 02:38:32.520]   - Yeah, yeah, the idea is basically that truth,
[02:38:32.520 --> 02:38:37.280]   he's got awesome one-liners, you know?
[02:38:37.280 --> 02:38:39.120]   So truth is a woman.
[02:38:39.120 --> 02:38:42.560]   So, okay, what does he mean by that?
[02:38:42.560 --> 02:38:43.520]   Truth is a woman.
[02:38:43.520 --> 02:38:45.400]   Basically, she's gonna lie to you.
[02:38:45.400 --> 02:38:47.280]   She looks real attractive,
[02:38:47.280 --> 02:38:49.440]   but she's not gonna tell you the truth.
[02:38:49.440 --> 02:38:51.960]   (both laughing)
[02:38:51.960 --> 02:38:53.280]   - Oh, Nietzsche, yeah.
[02:38:53.280 --> 02:38:55.600]   - So, okay, so basically, I'm not saying
[02:38:55.600 --> 02:38:56.760]   that that's true about women.
[02:38:56.760 --> 02:38:58.000]   I'm obviously a woman.
[02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:01.760]   So basically what he's saying is that truth is not,
[02:39:01.760 --> 02:39:04.480]   is like what I said, Brother Guy said,
[02:39:04.480 --> 02:39:06.480]   it's a moving target, okay?
[02:39:06.480 --> 02:39:08.680]   We started this whole conversation
[02:39:08.680 --> 02:39:09.880]   with what's real, right?
[02:39:09.880 --> 02:39:11.680]   So I should have just gone straight to Nietzsche.
[02:39:11.680 --> 02:39:13.680]   Have it not you heard truth is a woman?
[02:39:13.680 --> 02:39:15.720]   (both laughing)
[02:39:15.720 --> 02:39:17.040]   Okay, so truth is a woman.
[02:39:17.040 --> 02:39:18.520]   All right, so that, and also,
[02:39:18.520 --> 02:39:20.960]   and Foucault, this other philosopher,
[02:39:20.960 --> 02:39:23.800]   a French philosopher, actually takes up this idea
[02:39:23.800 --> 02:39:28.040]   and creates his own framework called genealogy from it.
[02:39:28.040 --> 02:39:29.840]   So the genealogy of morals,
[02:39:29.840 --> 02:39:31.880]   so that we only believe certain things
[02:39:31.880 --> 02:39:35.120]   and we sediment them into truth.
[02:39:35.160 --> 02:39:38.840]   So we say, a truth told, who said that?
[02:39:38.840 --> 02:39:40.480]   Was it Lenin or Stalin?
[02:39:40.480 --> 02:39:43.320]   A truth told enough times,
[02:39:43.320 --> 02:39:46.320]   I mean, a lie told enough times becomes the truth.
[02:39:46.320 --> 02:39:48.920]   So that's basically Nietzschean right there, okay?
[02:39:48.920 --> 02:39:49.840]   So that's Nietzsche.
[02:39:49.840 --> 02:39:52.800]   So Nietzsche also is a huge critic of Christianity,
[02:39:52.800 --> 02:39:56.320]   which I'm actually Catholic, I'm a practicing Catholic.
[02:39:56.320 --> 02:39:59.520]   So I appreciated his critique.
[02:39:59.520 --> 02:40:01.960]   I thought it was actually quite accurate.
[02:40:01.960 --> 02:40:04.720]   And he's a critique of religion in general.
[02:40:04.720 --> 02:40:06.280]   And he's fascinating.
[02:40:06.280 --> 02:40:08.000]   And also I find that his,
[02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:11.440]   he talks about altered states of consciousness
[02:40:11.440 --> 02:40:13.720]   and he calls them elevated states.
[02:40:13.720 --> 02:40:15.880]   And he, I think through his book,
[02:40:15.880 --> 02:40:18.160]   you can actually experience elevated states.
[02:40:18.160 --> 02:40:19.880]   So yeah, Nietzsche.
[02:40:19.880 --> 02:40:21.840]   (both laughing)
[02:40:21.840 --> 02:40:22.680]   Thumbs up.
[02:40:22.680 --> 02:40:24.680]   - So what other book?
[02:40:24.680 --> 02:40:26.480]   - Yeah, okay, so Hannah Rent.
[02:40:26.480 --> 02:40:30.320]   She is a philosopher that not a lot of people know about,
[02:40:30.320 --> 02:40:32.440]   but she was a Jewish woman during the Holocaust
[02:40:32.440 --> 02:40:36.520]   and she was interned at Bergen-Belsen,
[02:40:36.520 --> 02:40:39.800]   which was basically Auschwitz for women.
[02:40:39.800 --> 02:40:41.040]   And she escaped.
[02:40:41.040 --> 02:40:43.080]   She came to the United States
[02:40:43.080 --> 02:40:44.640]   and she had worked with Heidegger,
[02:40:44.640 --> 02:40:47.520]   even though he's supposed to be anti-Semitic
[02:40:47.520 --> 02:40:50.720]   and a Nazi and everything, but they were lovers, okay?
[02:40:50.720 --> 02:40:53.240]   So she comes out and she's at Columbia University
[02:40:53.240 --> 02:40:54.840]   and she teaches philosophy there.
[02:40:54.840 --> 02:40:57.520]   And she writes this, she writes two books,
[02:40:57.520 --> 02:40:58.520]   which I'll recommend.
[02:40:58.520 --> 02:41:00.440]   One is called "Eichmann in Jerusalem,"
[02:41:00.440 --> 02:41:03.200]   where she attends the Nuremberg trials.
[02:41:03.200 --> 02:41:06.680]   And she basically makes this really astute observation
[02:41:06.680 --> 02:41:07.520]   about evil.
[02:41:07.520 --> 02:41:09.720]   And she says, "Eichmann is one of the people
[02:41:09.720 --> 02:41:11.680]   "who sent the Jews to the concentration camps
[02:41:11.680 --> 02:41:14.080]   "who ran the trains," okay?
[02:41:14.080 --> 02:41:18.160]   And she said, "The thing about Eichmann was that
[02:41:18.160 --> 02:41:19.960]   "he didn't seem particularly evil.
[02:41:19.960 --> 02:41:23.240]   "Actually, he seemed to be quite a nice guy."
[02:41:23.240 --> 02:41:24.920]   She said, "What was interesting about him
[02:41:24.920 --> 02:41:28.080]   "was he seemed incredibly thoughtless and stupid."
[02:41:28.080 --> 02:41:30.220]   And she said, "And he used a lot of stereotypes
[02:41:30.220 --> 02:41:31.360]   "like memes."
[02:41:31.360 --> 02:41:34.320]   So she actually wrote about memes before we had them.
[02:41:34.320 --> 02:41:36.080]   And now people just use memes
[02:41:36.080 --> 02:41:38.080]   and they're actually used against us even.
[02:41:38.080 --> 02:41:40.080]   There's even a segments of warfare
[02:41:40.080 --> 02:41:42.640]   called mimetic warfare, all right?
[02:41:42.640 --> 02:41:44.620]   So memes are something that can sway
[02:41:44.620 --> 02:41:46.880]   a whole population of people.
[02:41:46.880 --> 02:41:50.400]   So she wrote about memes before they were even in existence.
[02:41:50.400 --> 02:41:52.200]   And that's Eichmann in Jerusalem.
[02:41:52.200 --> 02:41:54.080]   And I think she also has some really amazing things
[02:41:54.080 --> 02:41:59.080]   to say about evil, is that when people remain thoughtless,
[02:41:59.560 --> 02:42:01.620]   she has another book called "The Life of the Mind,"
[02:42:01.620 --> 02:42:05.060]   which is gigantic and I don't think anybody will read it,
[02:42:05.060 --> 02:42:08.260]   but frankly, it's one of the best books I've ever read.
[02:42:08.260 --> 02:42:09.700]   And I've read it many times.
[02:42:09.700 --> 02:42:11.340]   And basically, "The Life of the Mind,"
[02:42:11.340 --> 02:42:13.660]   in "The Life of the Mind," she asks a very simple question.
[02:42:13.660 --> 02:42:15.700]   She says, "Why do people do bad things?
[02:42:15.700 --> 02:42:16.820]   "Why are they evil?"
[02:42:16.820 --> 02:42:19.680]   And what she says is she wonders if it's,
[02:42:19.680 --> 02:42:22.620]   she says that bad people sleep well at night,
[02:42:22.620 --> 02:42:24.540]   contrary to, you know how the saying,
[02:42:24.540 --> 02:42:25.820]   "How do you sleep at night?"
[02:42:25.820 --> 02:42:27.500]   Well, that's only because you're a good person
[02:42:27.500 --> 02:42:28.860]   that you're asking that question,
[02:42:28.860 --> 02:42:30.440]   because you actually have a conscience.
[02:42:30.440 --> 02:42:32.800]   And a conscience is this dual kind of,
[02:42:32.800 --> 02:42:34.440]   you fight with yourself about
[02:42:34.440 --> 02:42:36.280]   the consequences of your actions.
[02:42:36.280 --> 02:42:39.640]   And she says, "Bad people don't seem to have a conscience.
[02:42:39.640 --> 02:42:41.400]   "So they actually sleep well at night."
[02:42:41.400 --> 02:42:44.080]   And so she goes through a whole history of philosophy
[02:42:44.080 --> 02:42:46.720]   about evil, and that's really a good one too.
[02:42:46.720 --> 02:42:48.920]   But I also have to recommend this one too.
[02:42:48.920 --> 02:42:49.800]   There's one more.
[02:42:49.800 --> 02:42:51.000]   So I know I recommended two,
[02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:53.040]   but just from the same philosopher.
[02:42:53.040 --> 02:42:55.520]   My friend Jeffrey Kripal, he's at Rice University,
[02:42:55.520 --> 02:42:57.800]   and he's in my field, religious studies.
[02:42:57.800 --> 02:42:59.900]   He's written several books.
[02:42:59.900 --> 02:43:01.420]   I mean, he's written a heck of a lot of books,
[02:43:01.420 --> 02:43:02.400]   let's put it that way.
[02:43:02.400 --> 02:43:04.900]   But I think his best book,
[02:43:04.900 --> 02:43:06.500]   or the one that impacted me the most,
[02:43:06.500 --> 02:43:08.820]   is called "Authors of the Impossible."
[02:43:08.820 --> 02:43:12.560]   And his writing is very much like Nietzsche's writing,
[02:43:12.560 --> 02:43:16.300]   in the sense that it's almost as if he reaches out
[02:43:16.300 --> 02:43:18.420]   of the pages and he grabs you,
[02:43:18.420 --> 02:43:20.060]   and he kind of slaps you around and says,
[02:43:20.060 --> 02:43:21.940]   "Think about this."
[02:43:21.940 --> 02:43:25.140]   And you can't help but be changed after you've read it.
[02:43:25.140 --> 02:43:28.240]   And he's got a great chapter in there about Jacques Vallée.
[02:43:28.240 --> 02:43:31.480]   - Oh, so he covers a bunch of different thinkers
[02:43:31.480 --> 02:43:36.480]   and authors that somehow are, what is it?
[02:43:36.480 --> 02:43:39.640]   Renegade in some aspect, or revolutionary in some aspect.
[02:43:39.640 --> 02:43:41.920]   - They're thinking the impossible.
[02:43:41.920 --> 02:43:45.200]   There's a great one he's written called "Mutants and Mystics,"
[02:43:45.200 --> 02:43:48.360]   where he talks about the comic strips.
[02:43:48.360 --> 02:43:51.840]   Gosh, why can't I remember the name of the person?
[02:43:51.840 --> 02:43:53.680]   He just died, Stan Lee.
[02:43:53.680 --> 02:43:56.860]   He talks about the history of the comics by Stan Lee,
[02:43:56.860 --> 02:43:58.620]   and they're all paranormal.
[02:43:58.620 --> 02:44:02.000]   They all start off super paranormal, and it's fascinating.
[02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:05.740]   - On the topic of Hannah Arendt.
[02:44:05.740 --> 02:44:06.580]   - Yeah, Hannah Arendt.
[02:44:06.580 --> 02:44:07.700]   - Hannah Arendt.
[02:44:07.700 --> 02:44:10.500]   So I haven't read her work,
[02:44:10.500 --> 02:44:15.500]   but I've vaguely touched upon commentary of her work,
[02:44:15.500 --> 02:44:20.300]   and it seems like some people think her work is dangerous
[02:44:20.300 --> 02:44:21.380]   in some aspect.
[02:44:21.380 --> 02:44:25.300]   I don't know if you can comment on why that is.
[02:44:25.300 --> 02:44:30.600]   It feels similar with Ayn Rand or something like that,
[02:44:30.600 --> 02:44:34.080]   where this is, I should say not dangerous, but controversial.
[02:44:34.080 --> 02:44:34.920]   - Yes, it is.
[02:44:34.920 --> 02:44:36.760]   Yes, they think it's controversial.
[02:44:36.760 --> 02:44:38.560]   This is the reason, I believe.
[02:44:38.560 --> 02:44:40.280]   I've heard of the controversy.
[02:44:40.280 --> 02:44:44.400]   The controversy is that she didn't, first of all,
[02:44:44.400 --> 02:44:49.400]   she is Jewish, and she did escape a concentration camp,
[02:44:49.560 --> 02:44:54.020]   and yet she's been called anti-Jewish.
[02:44:54.020 --> 02:44:56.820]   And I think part of that was that she basically
[02:44:56.820 --> 02:45:00.440]   was saying something that I believe,
[02:45:00.440 --> 02:45:05.120]   that a lot of normal people are like Eichmann,
[02:45:05.120 --> 02:45:08.100]   and evil things are done by people
[02:45:08.100 --> 02:45:09.940]   who just follow the rules,
[02:45:09.940 --> 02:45:12.340]   and they don't think about what they're doing.
[02:45:12.340 --> 02:45:15.760]   And that's one of the most pernicious forms
[02:45:15.760 --> 02:45:18.160]   of evil of our time.
[02:45:18.160 --> 02:45:22.520]   - So we talked quite a bit about the definitions of religion
[02:45:22.520 --> 02:45:26.180]   and what are the different building blocks of religion.
[02:45:26.180 --> 02:45:28.720]   So one of the, I don't think we touched on,
[02:45:28.720 --> 02:45:30.600]   we did a little bit with the afterlife,
[02:45:30.600 --> 02:45:33.700]   but in a sense, I don't know if you're familiar
[02:45:33.700 --> 02:45:35.100]   with the Ernest Becker work
[02:45:35.100 --> 02:45:37.640]   and all the philosophies around there
[02:45:37.640 --> 02:45:42.240]   about the fear of death and how the fear
[02:45:42.240 --> 02:45:45.840]   of our own mortality, awareness of our own mortality
[02:45:45.840 --> 02:45:50.840]   and its fear as in case of Ernest Becker,
[02:45:50.840 --> 02:45:57.120]   is a significant component in the psychology
[02:45:57.120 --> 02:46:01.140]   in the way we humans develop our understanding of the world.
[02:46:01.140 --> 02:46:06.140]   So what are your thoughts in the context of religion
[02:46:06.140 --> 02:46:10.000]   or maybe in the context of your own mind
[02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:15.000]   about the role of death in life, or fear of death in life?
[02:46:15.440 --> 02:46:17.900]   And are you afraid of death?
[02:46:17.900 --> 02:46:19.400]   (Donna laughs)
[02:46:19.400 --> 02:46:20.880]   Diana, what's your thought? - We cover everything
[02:46:20.880 --> 02:46:23.840]   in this podcast. - Every single topic
[02:46:23.840 --> 02:46:26.360]   is covered. - Wow, okay.
[02:46:26.360 --> 02:46:33.140]   I so happen to have benefited perhaps
[02:46:33.140 --> 02:46:35.560]   from living with an older brother
[02:46:35.560 --> 02:46:39.560]   who seemingly had no fear of death while growing up.
[02:46:39.560 --> 02:46:42.720]   And he did everything, okay?
[02:46:42.720 --> 02:46:47.400]   So he climbed mountains, he was a rock climber,
[02:46:47.400 --> 02:46:49.360]   he jumped out of airplanes.
[02:46:49.360 --> 02:46:51.200]   Of course he had to be a Green Beret
[02:46:51.200 --> 02:46:52.560]   and go into the special forces
[02:46:52.560 --> 02:46:57.520]   where that type of thing is a requirement, right?
[02:46:57.520 --> 02:47:00.500]   And so because of that, I did a lot of things
[02:47:00.500 --> 02:47:02.480]   outside of my comfort zone,
[02:47:02.480 --> 02:47:04.020]   and which probably I shouldn't have done.
[02:47:04.020 --> 02:47:07.680]   And hope to goodness my kids don't do them, okay?
[02:47:07.680 --> 02:47:09.400]   (Donna laughs)
[02:47:09.400 --> 02:47:12.640]   Okay, so do I fear death?
[02:47:12.640 --> 02:47:14.840]   I think about death a lot, actually.
[02:47:14.840 --> 02:47:16.360]   You may not know this about me,
[02:47:16.360 --> 02:47:21.360]   but in my field, I was the co-chair of the death panel.
[02:47:21.360 --> 02:47:24.320]   It's called the death panel. (laughs)
[02:47:24.320 --> 02:47:28.320]   Though it's the panel to think about death
[02:47:28.320 --> 02:47:32.760]   in religious studies, and I was that for many years.
[02:47:32.760 --> 02:47:34.160]   - So you've thought about it a bit.
[02:47:34.160 --> 02:47:35.400]   - A bit, let's see.
[02:47:35.400 --> 02:47:38.600]   I think that people are a little too confident,
[02:47:38.600 --> 02:47:40.240]   I think, about life in general,
[02:47:40.240 --> 02:47:43.760]   that they're gonna kind of live all the time and not die.
[02:47:43.760 --> 02:47:45.960]   I happen to, I mean, I hate to say it,
[02:47:45.960 --> 02:47:49.040]   I'm super positive, and most people would consider me
[02:47:49.040 --> 02:47:51.840]   to be too happy almost, right?
[02:47:51.840 --> 02:47:54.600]   And so it's odd then that I spend a lot of time
[02:47:54.600 --> 02:47:55.920]   thinking about death,
[02:47:55.920 --> 02:47:58.240]   but I wonder if there's a connection there.
[02:47:58.240 --> 02:48:00.440]   - Yeah. - I'm happy to be alive.
[02:48:00.440 --> 02:48:01.600]   Right? - Yeah, that's kind of
[02:48:01.600 --> 02:48:03.080]   what the thinking about death does,
[02:48:03.080 --> 02:48:05.920]   is it makes you appreciate the days that you do have.
[02:48:05.920 --> 02:48:07.840]   - Yeah. - It's a weird controversy.
[02:48:07.840 --> 02:48:12.600]   I tend to believe that the fact that this life ends
[02:48:12.600 --> 02:48:17.600]   gives each day a significant amount of meaning.
[02:48:17.600 --> 02:48:20.440]   So I don't know.
[02:48:20.440 --> 02:48:23.560]   It seems like an important feature of life.
[02:48:23.560 --> 02:48:25.720]   It's not like a bug, it seems like a feature,
[02:48:25.720 --> 02:48:28.560]   that it ends, but it's a strange feature,
[02:48:28.560 --> 02:48:30.880]   'cause I wish it, like all the good stuff,
[02:48:30.880 --> 02:48:32.560]   you wish it wouldn't end.
[02:48:32.560 --> 02:48:34.360]   - Well, you know what's interesting, Lex,
[02:48:34.360 --> 02:48:36.080]   and I do point this out to my students,
[02:48:36.080 --> 02:48:39.440]   'cause we cover, in a lot of the basic studies courses
[02:48:39.440 --> 02:48:42.200]   I teach, we cover all religions, or as many as we can,
[02:48:42.200 --> 02:48:43.280]   like the major religions.
[02:48:43.280 --> 02:48:46.600]   And so take Hinduism, for example.
[02:48:46.600 --> 02:48:48.680]   Now, this is an ancient religion, okay?
[02:48:48.680 --> 02:48:51.520]   So you and I are here talking about how we enjoy living
[02:48:51.520 --> 02:48:52.920]   and life and things like that.
[02:48:52.920 --> 02:48:55.280]   Well, the goal of Hinduism is basically
[02:48:55.280 --> 02:48:57.120]   never to get reincarnated again.
[02:48:57.120 --> 02:48:59.280]   It's basically to not live, okay?
[02:48:59.280 --> 02:49:02.320]   And to get off Samsara, which is the wheel of life and death.
[02:49:02.320 --> 02:49:05.600]   - Yeah, escape the whole thing. - Yeah, exactly.
[02:49:05.600 --> 02:49:08.040]   Think of that, conditions are so different
[02:49:08.040 --> 02:49:11.320]   that you and I and my students are happy to be alive.
[02:49:11.320 --> 02:49:15.200]   But they're back in the day, thousands of years ago,
[02:49:15.200 --> 02:49:17.080]   when they wrote, when they actually didn't write it,
[02:49:17.080 --> 02:49:18.320]   they spoke the Vedas,
[02:49:18.320 --> 02:49:21.080]   which were the sacred traditions of India.
[02:49:21.080 --> 02:49:24.000]   They wanted off, they didn't wanna come back.
[02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:25.560]   Life was terrible.
[02:49:25.560 --> 02:49:26.920]   That's what people don't have,
[02:49:26.920 --> 02:49:29.480]   the adequate understanding of history,
[02:49:29.480 --> 02:49:34.240]   that for the majority of people, life is really hard, right?
[02:49:34.240 --> 02:49:38.080]   And you and I, and your audience, among the lucky.
[02:49:38.080 --> 02:49:42.360]   - Yeah. - That we actually like life.
[02:49:42.360 --> 02:49:44.880]   We wanna live. (laughs)
[02:49:44.880 --> 02:49:46.800]   - Most of the time. - Yeah, most of the time.
[02:49:46.800 --> 02:49:49.000]   - What do you think, the biggest,
[02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:51.320]   since we're covering every single possible topic,
[02:49:51.320 --> 02:49:54.720]   let me ask the biggest one, the unanswerable one,
[02:49:54.720 --> 02:49:57.320]   from the perspective of alien intelligence,
[02:49:57.320 --> 02:49:59.400]   or from the perspective of religious studies,
[02:49:59.400 --> 02:50:02.080]   or from the perspective of just Diana,
[02:50:02.080 --> 02:50:06.000]   what do you think is the meaning of this existence,
[02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:08.320]   of this life of ours?
[02:50:08.320 --> 02:50:12.880]   - Yes, okay, so, all right, so. (laughs)
[02:50:12.880 --> 02:50:14.920]   Well, of course I have to,
[02:50:14.920 --> 02:50:18.360]   my philosophical training as an undergrad
[02:50:18.360 --> 02:50:20.720]   always makes me think about,
[02:50:20.720 --> 02:50:24.280]   what's the assumption in your question?
[02:50:24.280 --> 02:50:26.480]   There's an assumption there, it's like, there is a meaning.
[02:50:26.480 --> 02:50:27.920]   Okay, that's the assumption. - What do you mean by meaning?
[02:50:27.920 --> 02:50:28.920]   What do you mean by life?
[02:50:28.920 --> 02:50:30.600]   - Yeah. - Can you define the terms?
[02:50:30.600 --> 02:50:31.680]   - No, no, but listen.
[02:50:31.680 --> 02:50:32.800]   Okay, I'll answer your question.
[02:50:32.800 --> 02:50:34.520]   I'm just gonna say that there's this assumption
[02:50:34.520 --> 02:50:36.560]   that we should have meaning to life, okay?
[02:50:36.560 --> 02:50:39.680]   Well, maybe we shouldn't, maybe it's just all random, okay?
[02:50:39.680 --> 02:50:41.880]   However, I believe that it's not,
[02:50:41.880 --> 02:50:44.640]   and in my opinion, the meaning of life,
[02:50:44.640 --> 02:50:46.960]   in my opinion, is intrinsic.
[02:50:46.960 --> 02:50:49.000]   I enjoy living, I want to live.
[02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:50.480]   Sometimes I don't enjoy living,
[02:50:50.480 --> 02:50:53.520]   and when I don't enjoy living, I change my circumstances.
[02:50:53.520 --> 02:50:55.920]   So it's intrinsic, and I think that
[02:50:55.920 --> 02:50:58.320]   certain things are intrinsic, and like love,
[02:50:58.320 --> 02:50:59.960]   love of your children is kind of,
[02:51:00.960 --> 02:51:02.480]   well, it's actually physiological,
[02:51:02.480 --> 02:51:04.840]   but it's also intrinsic, it's beautiful.
[02:51:04.840 --> 02:51:06.560]   You know, there's something about it
[02:51:06.560 --> 02:51:10.320]   that is intrinsically desirable.
[02:51:10.320 --> 02:51:14.360]   So I think the meaning of life is like that,
[02:51:14.360 --> 02:51:16.880]   intrinsically desirable.
[02:51:16.880 --> 02:51:21.560]   - So it's something that just is born inside you
[02:51:21.560 --> 02:51:25.840]   based on what makes you feel good?
[02:51:25.840 --> 02:51:27.560]   - No, that's hedonism.
[02:51:27.560 --> 02:51:28.400]   That's (laughs)
[02:51:28.400 --> 02:51:30.320]   - So but where do you place love?
[02:51:30.320 --> 02:51:32.440]   Love of your children.
[02:51:32.440 --> 02:51:36.000]   - Yeah, so basically, love of your children, by the way,
[02:51:36.000 --> 02:51:39.240]   is not always easy, because they do things
[02:51:39.240 --> 02:51:40.800]   that they shouldn't do.
[02:51:40.800 --> 02:51:41.840]   You have to discipline them.
[02:51:41.840 --> 02:51:44.040]   That's one of the worst things about parenthood to me,
[02:51:44.040 --> 02:51:45.320]   is disciplining my children.
[02:51:45.320 --> 02:51:47.120]   I don't like to do that, I love them.
[02:51:47.120 --> 02:51:53.200]   So a lot of things that I do that I feel are good
[02:51:53.200 --> 02:51:57.720]   are not easy, so there's an intrinsic sense that,
[02:51:57.720 --> 02:52:01.160]   like, okay, let's take animals, okay?
[02:52:01.160 --> 02:52:02.640]   So we have dogs and cats, okay?
[02:52:02.640 --> 02:52:04.320]   So you might not, but I do.
[02:52:04.320 --> 02:52:07.680]   I've, you know, I told you about them. (laughs)
[02:52:07.680 --> 02:52:10.440]   - Can you share their names?
[02:52:10.440 --> 02:52:13.080]   - If I share their names, I will share their names, okay?
[02:52:13.080 --> 02:52:16.680]   So we have a cat, and it has red, fluffy hair,
[02:52:16.680 --> 02:52:18.480]   and so we called it Trump.
[02:52:18.480 --> 02:52:20.160]   Well, when we got our dog,
[02:52:20.160 --> 02:52:22.000]   we figured that it needed a companion,
[02:52:22.000 --> 02:52:23.520]   so we called it Putin.
[02:52:23.520 --> 02:52:25.160]   So we have Trump and Putin.
[02:52:25.160 --> 02:52:28.640]   - That's the greatest pet names of all time, I'm sorry.
[02:52:28.640 --> 02:52:31.320]   (both laughing)
[02:52:31.320 --> 02:52:35.120]   Or maybe we'll be able to share a picture of your cat,
[02:52:35.120 --> 02:52:36.360]   'cause this is awesome.
[02:52:36.360 --> 02:52:37.600]   - It is really cute, yeah.
[02:52:37.600 --> 02:52:38.800]   (both laughing)
[02:52:38.800 --> 02:52:39.800]   - Very photogenic.
[02:52:39.800 --> 02:52:44.800]   I mean, is this something that's,
[02:52:44.800 --> 02:52:49.800]   whether we're talking about love or the intrinsic meaning,
[02:52:49.800 --> 02:52:53.920]   do you think that's something that's really special
[02:52:53.920 --> 02:52:57.440]   to humans, or if there is intelligent
[02:52:57.440 --> 02:52:59.440]   alien civilizations out there,
[02:52:59.440 --> 02:53:03.000]   do you think that's something that they possess as well,
[02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:05.920]   maybe in different forms?
[02:53:05.920 --> 02:53:10.200]   Like whatever this thing that meaning is,
[02:53:10.200 --> 02:53:13.600]   this intrinsic drive that we have,
[02:53:13.600 --> 02:53:16.680]   do you think that's just a property of life,
[02:53:16.680 --> 02:53:18.440]   of some level of complexity,
[02:53:18.440 --> 02:53:22.560]   that we will see that everywhere in this universe?
[02:53:22.560 --> 02:53:24.800]   - In my opinion, and this is just my opinion,
[02:53:24.800 --> 02:53:27.600]   I do think that it is,
[02:53:27.600 --> 02:53:30.240]   but I also think that it could take different forms.
[02:53:30.240 --> 02:53:33.240]   So if there is like, think of gravity, right?
[02:53:33.240 --> 02:53:35.920]   Gravity kind of like makes stuff stick to it, right?
[02:53:35.920 --> 02:53:37.560]   It attracts stuff.
[02:53:37.560 --> 02:53:38.800]   Well, what does love do?
[02:53:38.800 --> 02:53:40.200]   That does that too, right?
[02:53:40.200 --> 02:53:43.320]   So people who are, we call them charismatic.
[02:53:43.320 --> 02:53:45.720]   Charism, it means love.
[02:53:45.720 --> 02:53:47.440]   Charism means light and love.
[02:53:47.440 --> 02:53:50.560]   So a charismatic person is a person
[02:53:50.560 --> 02:53:53.880]   who attracts people to them like the sun does, right?
[02:53:53.880 --> 02:53:54.720]   Like, you know?
[02:53:54.720 --> 02:53:59.520]   So I think that whatever this property is,
[02:53:59.520 --> 02:54:02.160]   that's intrinsic, is like gravity,
[02:54:02.160 --> 02:54:04.800]   and most likely takes different forms
[02:54:04.800 --> 02:54:07.160]   in different types of life forms.
[02:54:07.160 --> 02:54:11.560]   - Yeah, I can't wait until like Albert Einstein type
[02:54:11.560 --> 02:54:14.400]   of figure in the future will discover that love is in fact,
[02:54:14.400 --> 02:54:17.160]   one of the fundamental forces of physics.
[02:54:17.160 --> 02:54:18.160]   - That would be cool.
[02:54:18.160 --> 02:54:19.280]   (Diana laughs)
[02:54:19.280 --> 02:54:22.600]   - Diana, this is one of the favorite conversations
[02:54:22.600 --> 02:54:23.440]   I've ever had.
