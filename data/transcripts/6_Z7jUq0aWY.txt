[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   The gifts, I say, must be differentiated from natural gifts.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   The spiritual gift is something that is given to a man.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   We've all got certain natural gifts.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   But the spiritual gift, which any one of us may possess,
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   is something entirely different from that.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   It is a gift that is given directly to us by the Holy Spirit.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   Now, that's the first point to hold in our minds, therefore,
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   that it is something separate from and distinct from natural gifts.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   Let us go further and say this.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   It doesn't even mean the heightening of a natural gift.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   Now, some people have fallen into that error.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   They have thought that what a spiritual gift really means is
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   that a man's natural gift, taken hold of by the Holy Spirit, is heightened,
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   or made more vivid, and that that is, therefore, a spiritual gift.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   Well, that again, as I understand this teaching,
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   and I think it's commonly accepted teaching,
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   that is not what the Scripture would have us believe.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   It is something separate from, something new, something which is different.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Now, here is a definition that's given in a well-known Greek lexicon,
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   which I think up to a point is helpful.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   The gift is described as
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   "extraordinary powers distinguishing certain Christians
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   and enabling them to serve the Church of Christ,
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   the reception of which is due to the power of divine grace
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   operating in their souls by the Holy Spirit."
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   That's all right. It's putting it quite clearly.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Well, now, the great thing I say to remember here is
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   that it is something new and special and different,
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   which is given to us by the Holy Spirit directly.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   They are called the charismata, and people talk about these charismatic gifts.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   And if you use such a term as that, you mean by that that it isn't a natural gift,
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   but it's something new, over and above, direct from the Spirit which is given.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   That's the first comment.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Then, the second comment, and a very important one is this,
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   that these gifts are bestowed upon us by the Holy Spirit in a sovereign manner.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   The sovereignty of the Spirit in the giving of these gifts
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   is emphasized very clearly in this chapter.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Listen to verse 11, for instance.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   "But all these worketh that one and the self same Spirit,
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   dividing to every man severally, as he will."
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   As he will.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   It is he who decides, and not us.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   He decides to whom to give the gift.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   He decides what particular gift to give to this particular person.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   And I wonder whether we are going too far when we say this,
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   that the idea of the sovereignty of the Holy Spirit in the dispensing of these gifts
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   carries implicitly not only the which and the to whom, but also the when.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   That it is the prerogative of the Holy Spirit in his sovereign power
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   as one of the three persons in the blessed Holy Spirit,
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   not only, I say, to decide what person and what gift,
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   but when to give particular gifts.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   To withhold them if he chooses, to give them if he chooses.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   He is Lord, he is sovereign in this respect.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   And therefore I say that it is very important to bear that in mind.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   The principle, then, I say, is that the Holy Spirit is absolutely sovereign in this matter.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   And he decides. It's brought out clearly in verse 11.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   But the very term which is used, beginning, say, at verse 7 and going on,
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   enforces the same point. Listen.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   It's a gift, you see.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   It's something that comes entirely, it's given, it's altogether from the Holy Spirit.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   And that emphasizes this element and aspect of his sovereignty.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   Then we go on to a third principle, which is clearly taught in this chapter.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   That each Christian is given and has, therefore, some gift.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   That's verse 7.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   So that here there is very definite and clear teaching that a gift is given to us each and every one.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   Verse 11 really says it again.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   But all these worketh that one and the self, same Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   The clear implication there is that every single Christian is given some particular gift.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Indeed, it seems to me that the analogy which the Apostle uses in this chapter
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   concerning the nature of the Church, this perfect analogy of the human frame, the body,
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   of necessity carries this idea that there is a special function
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   and a special gift to every single member of the Christian Church.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   You notice he says some are important, some unimportant, some comely, some less comely, and so on.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   But he says all these are necessary for the body.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   Some seem to be more feeble, he says, but they're essential.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   And every single part, however small and insignificant apparently,
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   every one has its place and position in the body and is enabled to function by the Holy Spirit.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   So that from this we deduce that every member of the Christian Church,
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   I mean by that every true member of the body of Christ,
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   every true Christian who has been baptized into the body of Christ by this one spirit
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   has some particular spiritual gift.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   Then the next principle, the fourth principle taught here obviously is this,
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   that the gifts that are given differ in value.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   Now there again let me quote you some verses, verses 14 and 15.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   "For the body is not one member," he says, "but many."
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   And then you've got it still more explicitly in verse 28.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   "And God hath set some in the church, first," you notice, "first, apostles,
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   secondarily, prophets, thirdly, teachers, after that, miracles, then gifts of healing,
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   helps, governments, diversities of tongues."
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   And as I've just been saying, he does compare the various parts in these words,
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   "Nay, much more those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary,
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   and those members of the body which we think to be less honorable,
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   upon these we bestow more abundant honor,
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness," and so on.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   And he goes on to say that "God hath tempered the body together,
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   having given more abundant honor to that part which lacked," and so on.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   So that there, again, we have this definite teaching that the gifts differ in value.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   But if you go on to chapter 14, you'll find he says it still more explicitly.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   In verse 5, for instance, "I would," he says, "that he all speak with tongues,
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   but rather that he prophesied.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   For greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues,
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying."
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   And again in the famous statement in verse 19, verses 18 and 19,
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   "I thank my God I speak with tongues more than he all,
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding,
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   that by my vice I might teach others also,
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue."
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   And you notice in any case, as I shall be emphasizing later,
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   the position which he allots always to the gift of tongues in his various lists.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   And obviously it is done quite intentionally.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   Very well, there is another principle, but let us now go on to the fifth.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   The fifth principle is that all gifts, or any gifts, must always be used in love.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   That is the great message of the thirteenth chapter, isn't it?
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   "Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have no charity,
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   I am become a sounding brass or as a tinkling cymbal," and so on.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   This is a thing he is most concerned to emphasize,
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   that whatever the gift is, it must be used in love,
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   which indeed entitles us to say this,
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   that you should never estimate or judge a man's spirituality
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   solely in terms of the gifts that he possesses.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   These two things do not always run parallel.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   A man may have a remarkable gift, and yet he may be failing in certain respects,
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   so that you cannot always equate these things.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   Obviously there is teaching in Scripture which says
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   that eventually such a man shall be deprived of his gift.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   But it is equally clear that for a while,
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   a man's gift may be very much greater than his spiritual condition.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   And another way of putting this self-same truth is to say this,
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   you will often find in the history of the church,
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   and especially perhaps in the history of revivals,
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   that God has chosen men of very small, natural gifts,
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   and has given them some remarkable spiritual gift.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   As if to emphasize my first point and this point,
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   so that we can never, as it were,
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   deduce too readily about a man from the gift that he possesses.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   There are these other factors that have to be brought into consideration.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   Very well, then, all the gifts must be used in love.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   Ultimately, they are of no value to us,
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   and we shall not profit by them unless we do use them in love.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   The gift may be used, as God could use a man like Cyrus and others in the Old Testament,
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   but it doesn't tell us anything of necessity about the state and the condition of the soul.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   And my last general point would be this one,
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   that there is no gift concerning which you have a right to say or to postulate
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   that a Christian must possess it if he has the Holy Spirit.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   Now, that's rather an involved way of putting it.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   Let me put it in another way.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   There are those who would say that unless we have possessed or manifested a particular gift,
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   that we have never been baptized by the Spirit or have never known any fullness of the Spirit.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   I suggest to you that any reading of these three chapters gives the lie direct to any such teaching.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   There is not a single gift mentioned here of which we are told that it must be present.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   Rather, the whole suggestion is that one has one and one another,
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   and you never know which gift the man is going to have.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   But there is no universal gift, which is a sine qua non,
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   and which must be insisted upon as being present.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   That seems to be teaching which is utterly unscriptural,
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   indeed a denial, it seems to me, of the very thing that the Apostle is concerned to say in this chapter,
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   and especially in view of his elaboration of his doctrine in the analogy of the human body.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   Now then, there I say the things about which I think we can assume more or less general agreement,
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   apart from certain odd persons.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   But now I come and I raise another problem, another question,
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   which is certainly more controversial, and especially perhaps at the present time.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   Are these gifts, and are all these gifts, meant for the Christian Church always and at all times?
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   What have we got here?
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   Have we got a description here of what was true only of the early Church,
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   or is it to be equally true of the Church today?
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   What are these gifts?
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   Were they temporary, or are they permanent?
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   Can you say any of these things about all of them, or do you have to subdivide them?
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   Now there is, as I say, a very debatable question,
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   and you will know that there are authorities on both sides,
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   as is invariably the case with these difficult matters,
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   about which I suggest to you humbly that we can't arrive at any finality in this world and in this life,
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   so that with regard to this question, as with regard to so many others,
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   dogmatism should be avoided,
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   and we must try to approach the Scriptures with as little prejudice as we can,
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   and try to consider what they teach.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   Now there are certain statements, therefore, that I'd like to put to your consideration.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   First of all, there are certain scriptural statements which seem to me to throw light on this problem.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   Here is one, for instance.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   The apostle, at the end of the second chapter of his epistle to the Ephesians,
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   the twentieth verse, actually, Ephesians 2, 20,
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   talks about the Christian Church being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets,
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   You notice the term is the foundation of the apostles and prophets.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   Now, surely the term foundation does suggest once and for all.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   You lay a foundation once and once only,
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   and then you build and erect on your foundation.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   You don't continue a foundation.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   By definition, a foundation is something that is not continued.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   It's laid and there it is.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   That's the end of the foundation.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   And you do things on the foundation.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   Now then, the apostles and prophets are the foundation,
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   which surely and clearly suggests that they are not to be repeated,
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   but that they were special men at the beginning and the foundation
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   and the origin of the Christian Church who are not to be repeated.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   Surely it's not difficult to understand this when you come to think of it.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   These were the men who were there to teach and to preach
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   and to instruct the Christian people before the New Testament canon came into being,
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   before the Gospels were written, before these epistles were written.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   There wasn't a New Testament.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   We so often tend to forget that.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   We don't remember that, putting it almost at a minimum,
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   there were 20 years when there were Christian people
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   and members of Christian churches without a New Testament.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   And they were dependent upon this oral teaching and instruction,
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   apostles and the prophets, who were inspired and authoritative
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   and who spoke without error.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   But surely once the documents had come into being,
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   the necessity for that was no longer there.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   Having had the testimony and the teaching of the apostles and prophets
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   which we have in our New Testament documents,
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   there is the foundation and nothing further is required.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   So there is in that sense no necessity for apostles and prophets
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   after the apostles and prophets who were the foundation at the beginning.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   And as a matter of fact, it's very interesting to observe
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   that the early church did not claim that they were apostles and prophets.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   They all pointed back to them.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   When the church came to define the New Testament canon,
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   the big test they always applied, you remember we saw about two years ago,
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   was this test of apostolicity.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   Could a writing that was put forward be traced to an apostle,
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   or if not to an apostle, to the influence, direct influence of an apostle?
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   Apostolicity.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   They didn't claim that they were apostles.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   They looked back to the apostles as the authorities.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   A most significant fact.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   Now, I recommended a book some time ago,
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   and I repeat the recommendation at this point.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   A book, I think you'll find it in the book room here,
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   by a man called Geldenhuis, and the title is "Supreme Authority."
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   I recommend that book very strongly in this particular connection.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   It really is of great value in the whole question of the authority of Scripture.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   And he brings out very clearly the point I'm just making,
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   that those who followed the apostles did not make this claim for themselves,
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   but looked back to the apostles and pointed back to the apostles.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   Well then, I think always that Hebrews, in the second chapter,
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   is interesting at this point.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   Verses 3 and 4, you remember,
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   where we are told, "How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation,
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord,
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him,
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   God also bearing them witnessed both with signs and wonders,
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   and with diverse miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghost,
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   according to his own will."
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   Now, surely the suggestion there is this.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   I'm calling attention, says this man, to this great salvation,
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   and you mustn't neglect it, for certain reasons.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   It first began to be spoken by the Lord himself,
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   and it was confirmed to us by them that heard him.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   That's to say, the apostles.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   God bore them witnessed, that's to say, the apostles,
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   with the signs and wonders and diverse miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghost,
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   according to his own will.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   The suggestion being, surely, that these particular gifts and manifestations
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   were given to them in order to attest their apostolic authority.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   And therefore, having had that, and having had their teaching as we have it here,
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   there is no further need for such gifts.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   Now, that seems to me to be the arguments of the second chapter of Hebrews verses 3 and 4.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   There are some who would say that even the thirteenth chapter of the first epistle to the Corinthians
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   teaches it in verse 8.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   We read, "Charity never faileth; but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail;
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   and whether there be tongues, they shall cease;
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   and whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away."
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   Some authorities say that that means that Paul was there prophesying that these things would end.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   To be quite frank and honest, I can't accept it.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   I think he's referring to something much beyond this, to the ultimate glory,
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   when we shall see face to face, when love alone will be left,
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   and even faith and hope will be turned into sight.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   But I mention it to you because it is an argument that has commended itself to some.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   Very well, there are certain scriptural statements that, to put it ad inerit like this,
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   suggest that these gifts were only temporary for the church at that point, speaking generally.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   Well then, we come on to a second point, which is this.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   It is really important to notice what happened after the days of the apostles.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   And the fact is that these gifts did disappear after the apostles.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   Now you can read the evidence for yourselves.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   You will find a number of books dispute that.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   But if you trace back to the source, you will find that it really can be established.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   I have to give you this on my own word tonight.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   I can assure you I could give you the evidence.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   If you trace the sources right back, it is perfectly clear that these gifts did cease after the days of the apostles.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   The gifts were withdrawn.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   But then some people say, "Ah yes, we admit that."
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   But they say, "Wasn't that surely due to the fact that the church became less spiritual than she was before?
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   And isn't that the trouble today that the church is so unspiritual that the gifts are not given and are not being manifested?"
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   To which there seems to me to be a very clear and obvious answer, which is this.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   That the gifts, as I've been emphasizing, are bestowed by the Spirit in a sovereign manner, irrespective of us.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   It is His prerogative.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   But there is a still more powerful argument.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   If the argument is that low spirituality means absence of gifts, high spirituality means presence of gifts,
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   well then, how do you think it ever came to pass that there were any gifts at all in the church at Corinth,
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   which is surely one of the least spiritual of all the New Testament churches?
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   There were excesses, there were abuses, indeed the whole state of the church was in a most pathetic condition.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   And yet, you see, the gifts were very much in evidence there.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   It seems to me that this one epistle on its own is sufficient to prove that we must never use such an argument.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   And furthermore, there is this argument of history.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   You will find that revivals have generally come when things have been at a very low ebb.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   When some of the saints had almost given up hope, then the power descended.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   That is why men who think that they can prepare a revival or work up a revival are so unscriptural and unhistorical.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   It is when everything seems to be going the other way that God visits the church with revival and with reawakening.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   So that again, I suggest to you that that is an important consideration as you try to come to a conclusion about this matter.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   Then I would add this further comment, that if we do believe that these gifts, most of them, were for the apostolic era only,
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   it does not mean for a moment that no miracles have taken place ever since.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   It does not mean that. It means that the gift of miracles is withdrawn.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   Clearly, throughout the history of the church, miracles have taken place and have been performed from time to time.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   And to say that these particular gifts, which are dealt with here, were for the apostolic period only,
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   in no sense denies the possibility of a miracle at any time or at any moment.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   For instance, if you say that the gift of healing has been withdrawn, that it was specially for this time,
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   that does not mean for a second that you would have to say, therefore,
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   that no person has ever been healed as the result of the prayers of Christian people.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   Because there are obviously and clearly many examples and illustrations of that very thing taking place.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   In other words, we've got to get this thing clear in our minds, that we are discussing these special gifts that were given
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   to attest the authority of the apostles, these special gifts at the beginning.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   But God being God, God can work a miracle whenever he likes and wherever he likes.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   And he can answer prayer in an unusual manner whenever he chooses to do so.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   So let us be clear about that in our minds.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   To say that the gifts were only for that period is not to deny the possibility of miracles now,
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   nor the possibility of marvelous answers to prayer and things which clearly belong to the supernatural realm.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   Everyone, you will see by this that my own tendency is to say that at any rate with regard to certain of these gifts,
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   we must say that they were temporary.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   But I want to go on to suggest that there are other gifts which obviously are permanent.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   I can't make a sweeping statement about this, say all or none, not at all.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   I want to try to show you that some gifts were temporary,
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   other gifts were then, they've continued ever since and are in evidence today.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   So I would suggest this subdivision.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   First of all, temporary gifts.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   What are they?
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   Well, first and foremost, the gift of apostleship.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   The apostles are not repeated once and for all.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   So the gift necessary to make a man an apostle is no longer present.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   That was a temporary gift.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   The same applies to the gift of prophecy.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   What is this gift of prophecy about which we read in the New Testament?
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   Well, it means two things, as it does in the Old Testament.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   It means a forth-telling.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   It means a conveying of truth from God to people.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   It means that you become the vehicle and the channel of communicating a revelation or a teaching to people.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   Divinely inspired to do so.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   And it also means forth-telling.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   Now it's quite clear that these New Testament prophets exercised their gift in both those respects.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   But as I was saying a few moments ago,
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   that was obviously something that was necessary before we had our New Testament canon.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   But it is no longer necessary.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   And that is why we take our stand upon this position,
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   that there has been throughout the centuries no additional revelation beyond that which we have in this book.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   So if any man has ever claimed at any time, or does today, that he's got some further revelation, we reject that claim.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   That is why we, for instance, will not accept the authoritative claims of the Roman Catholic Church.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   That church claims that she has been receiving revelation exactly as the apostles and prophets did.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   They say that she is as inspired as they were,
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   so that certain truth has been revealed to her since the end of the canon.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   That is why they've promulgated their doctrine of the Immaculate Conception,
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   and recently the Assumption of the Virgin Mary and so on.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   They claim, you see, that they're the continuation of the apostleship, the apostolate,
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   and that there is inspiration today as there was then.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   So you see the importance of having certain clear distinctions in our mind.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   The gift of prophecy, like the gift of apostleship, was a temporary one,
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   and it ceased when it was no longer necessary.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   I would put into this same category also the gift of healing.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   Now don't misunderstand me again.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   I'm talking about the gift of healing.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   By which I understand this, that certain of these people had been given a gift by the Holy Spirit,
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   whereby they themselves directly could heal people.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   It doesn't mean that they prayed for them and that as a result of their prayers that the patient was healed.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   It means that they literally, actually, directly, and immediately healed the patient.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   That's what the gift of healing means.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   I suggest that was a temporary gift.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   Now I know that cases are reported in which people today seem to have a healing gift.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   Yes, you'll find some of them are spiritualists and some of them don't even claim to be spiritualists
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   and they're not Christians at all, but they've got some odd healing power.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   I'm not here to dispute that.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   I'm not here to dispute phenomena.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   But what I am asserting is that the Holy Spirit's gift of healing
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   is something that ceased with the apostles.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   And the same applies to miracles.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   The gift of miracles.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   Remember I said just now that miracles have taken place since.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   But that's a very different thing from the gift of miracles,
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   which obviously the apostle Peter possessed, which the apostle Paul possessed.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   He could exercise it here, he could exercise it there.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   He was given a commission to do so and he had the ability to do so.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   Now that is a gift which has disappeared.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   Again, the Roman Catholic Church will tell you that it still has it.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   But we have other ideas with respect to that and other explanations
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   as to what they put forward as supposed miracles.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   But I'm not disputing the possibility of a miracle.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   I am asserting that the gift of miracles ended with the apostles.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   And in the same way the gift of discerning spirits.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   And in the same way with the gift of tongues.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   Now let us say just a few words about this gift
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   as it so often leads to trouble and to confusion.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   You are told about this gift of tongues in three chapters in the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   The second chapter, the tenth chapter, and the nineteenth chapter.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   And then it's dealt with in 1 Corinthians 12, 13, and 14.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   The great question debated throughout the centuries is this.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   Do the three chapters in the Acts
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   refer to the same thing as the three chapters in 1 Corinthians?
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   Is the thing described in the Acts of the Apostles
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   identical with the thing that was taking place in the church at Corinth?
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   Now there are different schools of thought.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   There are those who say, "No, these things are not the same."
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   They say, "In the book of Acts, what you had was the apostles and others
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   literally speaking in other languages."
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   Not speaking in Greek or Hebrew, but perhaps speaking in Latin
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   or in some of these various dialects of those various peoples,
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   Medes and Parthians and so on,
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   who were gathered together at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   There, they say, it's clearly a question of using other languages.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   Whereas they say in Corinthians, it isn't that.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   It's some sort of ecstatic utterance, which isn't a language at all.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   But the person taken up by the Holy Spirit emits sounds and languages,
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   sounds and words which he doesn't understand.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   And it's not really a language at all, just an ecstatic utterance.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   That is one, and perhaps the largest, school of thought
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   which would differentiate the two things from one another.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   But again, speaking for myself, I find it very difficult to accept that.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   Because I find that the terms which are used in the Acts and in 1 Corinthians
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   are precisely the same.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   And it seems to me to be an unnecessary thing
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   to postulate two different things if one will account for it all.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   But then the question that is asked is if you say that,
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   "But we are told that these people in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost,
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   everyone heard these apostles speaking in their own language."
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   Of course.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   That seems to me to be a part of the miraculous thing that took place.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   In other words, I suggest to you that by the power of the Holy Spirit,
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   these people who were listening
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   were enabled to hear it in their own language,
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   though their own language was not being spoken.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   Now there were at least 15 different dialects spoken
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   by those people who were present at Jerusalem at that time.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   You count it up and check.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   15 different dialects and speeches.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   And it seems to me to be quite incredible
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   that if these 15 different languages were being spoken at the same time,
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   in these conditions,
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   that these people who were standing by and listening
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   could each one differentiate not only his own language,
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   but could clearly follow what was being said.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   It seems to me to be impossible.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   But here is the thing that seems to me to be quite possible.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   That the apostles were speaking in some kind of speech,
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   and the Holy Spirit, as it were,
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   conveyed that speech to all these people
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   as if it were coming in their own tongue and in their own language.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   And they understood what was being said.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   They understood these men telling forth these wonderful works of God.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   So that I suggest the difference between the Acts and the 1 Corinthians
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   is simply this.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   That the thing was done in all its perfection on the day of Pentecost
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   and in the house of Cornelius and in Ephesus.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   Whereas in Corinth there was this difference.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   That sometimes the man speaking in Corinth himself didn't know what he was saying.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   And sometimes nobody else did, except an occasional interpreter.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   Apart from that one difference and distinction, I see no difference at all.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   As if the thing were done in all its fullness and its glory at Jerusalem, etc.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   But here in Corinth, the utterance was made,
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   but the ability to understand it was not conveyed to others.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   Of course, it wasn't conveyed to all at Jerusalem.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   Because there were some who thought that these men were filled with a new wine, you remember.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   They were not given this ability to understand.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   But there in Corinth you had these interpreters
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   who were able to explain what it meant.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   Well, very well, there are some, it seems to me, of these things which we must bear in mind.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   And the other points, of course, are these.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   That the gift of tongues is not meant for all.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   The apostle asks, "Do all speak with tongues?"
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   And the answer is, of course, "No."
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   All do not speak in tongues, all do not have the gifts of healing,
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   all do not interpret, etc., etc.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   And you notice that he always puts this gift last in his lists.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   In chapter 14 he's at great pains to say that it all must be controlled and order.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   Everything must be done decently and in order,
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   that God is not the author of confusion.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   So if you meet somebody who says that he speaks in tongues,
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   or if you've been at a meeting where this is claimed,
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   and if there was disorder and confusion,
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   well, you're entitled to say, in terms of the scriptural teaching,
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   that whatever else it may have been,
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   it wasn't the thing described in the church at Corinth.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   Here, I say, is the thing that the apostle always emphasizes.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   The order, the control which must be exercised.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   Well, I leave it at that.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   It's a difficult subject,
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   but if we bear heed constantly to the injunctions and the warnings
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   and the teaching of the scripture, we shall be saved from much trouble.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   Just to complete this this evening,
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   may I suggest to you a list of the permanent gifts?
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   I shan't comment on them.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   The word of wisdom,
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   the word of knowledge,
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   the word of teaching, the ability to teach,
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   the gift of ministering and helps,
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   the gift of administrations and governments,
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   the ability that deacons and elders and others have,
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   and such gifts,
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   the gift of evangelism,
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   the gift for the pastorate,
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   the gift of exhortation,
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   and the gift which is mentioned here,
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   which is often a cause of confusion,
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   the gift of faith.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   Did you notice that amongst these gifts
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   is one which is mentioned as the gift of faith?
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   And people have often stumbled at that.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   What's it mean?
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   Well, the simple answer to that is this.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   The gift of faith mentioned in 1 Corinthians 12
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   is obviously the kind of gift
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   that was given to a man like George Muller or Hudson Ten.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   It isn't the gift of believing in Christ
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   because every Christian has that,
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   whereas every Christian has not the gift of faith
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   mentioned in 1 Corinthians 12.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   It's this special gift of faith
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   that enables a man to trust God
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   in the way those men did and others have done.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   And God, by that means and through them,
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   manifests his glory and his power.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   And then may I add just one word
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   so that we can say that this evening
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   we have come to the end of our consideration
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   of the doctrine of the Holy Spirit in the Bible.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   It isn't really a part of the doctrine,
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   but many friends are troubled
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   by this great question and problem
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   of what is called the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   As I say, it isn't a part of the teaching of the doctrine
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   concerning the Holy Spirit,
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   and yet for the sake of helping those who may be in trouble,
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   let me say just a word.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   You find that, you remember, in Matthew 12, verses 31 and 32.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   You find the corresponding places in Mark 3 and in Luke 11.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   Now, I can deal with this subject very, very simply.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   What is this blasphemy or sin against the Holy Ghost?
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   Christian people are often troubled that they are guilty of it.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   The answer is this.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   If you are troubled about it,
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   you can be absolutely certain that you're not guilty of it.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   What is it?
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   Well, look at it as it's described in those passages.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   See it in the 6th of Hebrews and the 10th of Hebrews.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   See it in 1 John 5, where he says,
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   "There is a sin which is unto death, for which you should not pray."
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   What does it mean? It means this.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   It means that a man deliberately rejects Christ
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   and glories in his rejection of Him.
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   Perhaps he even attributes the powers of Christ to Beelzebub or to a devil,
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   as the Pharisees did.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   They said, "He's casting out devils by the prince of the devils, by Beelzebub."
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   The man, therefore, who is guilty of the sin against the Holy Ghost,
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   not only doesn't believe in Christ,
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   he doesn't want to believe in Him.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   He ridicules Him.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   He treats Him with scorn and derision.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   He turns his back upon Him and he dismisses Him.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   So, my friend, if you are worried that you've sinned against the Holy Ghost
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   and you want to be right with God and want to be right with Christ
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   and feel that you've sinned yourself out of the relationship
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   and you're moaning and groaning because you're out of the relationship and not in,
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   not only are you not guilty of the sin against the Holy Ghost,
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   you are as far removed from it as a person can ever be.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   These people are happy.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   They're gloating in it.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   They're glorying in it.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   They're proud of themselves.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   Proud of their rejection.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   You are the exact opposite.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   It grieves you.
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   It troubles you.
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   You'd give anything to know Him and to be right with Him.
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   My dear friend, don't listen to the lie of the devil
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   who is trying to depress you and to rob you of your joy.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   Turn upon Him and say,
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   "My very desire to know Him and to be right with Him
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   is a proof that I have not committed the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost."
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   And if you do so, I can assure you, you will find deliverance.
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   You will find peace
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   and the joy of the Lord and of salvation will be restored unto you.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   Well, we leave it at that for this evening.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   And now let us turn to God and thank Him.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   We thank Thee, our Heavenly Father.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   We thank Thee again in a special way for Thy Word.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   O Lord, our God, how we would thank Thee
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   that Thou hast not left us with all these various possibilities
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   on the one hand and on the other
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   without any light and without any guidance and instruction.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   O God, we pray Thee
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   that Thou wouldst enable us to understand Thy Word and its teaching.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   Grant unto us that humility of mind,
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   that readiness to learn and to listen.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   Deliver us, O God, from any potty, prejudiced spirit.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   But grant that we may have but one concern,
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   to know Thee the only true God
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   and to live to Thy glory and to tell forth Thy praise
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   and to extend Thy kingdom.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   O God, help us to see and to know
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   that as long as our one great central concern
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   is to glorify the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   we cannot go astray.
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   Keep us, therefore, we pray Thee,
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   from coveting gifts for the sake of gifts.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   But show us that more excellent way.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   And O God, grant us all to see and to know
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   that it is as we manifest the fruit of the Spirit
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   that we are well-pleasing in Thy sight
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   and a testimony to those who are round and about us.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   And now may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   and the love of God
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   and the fellowship and the communion of the Holy Spirit
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   abide and continue with us this night and evermore.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   Amen.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
