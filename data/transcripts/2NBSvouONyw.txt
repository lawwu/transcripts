[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.720]   The influence of a godly woman is not to be underestimated.
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.440]   Peter makes that point in 1 Peter 3,
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.660]   a chapter we've been focused on recently.
[00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.360]   We looked at 1 Peter 3, 3 and asked,
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.720]   "How much jewelry is too much jewelry?"
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.020]   That was last time on Monday in APJ 1834.
[00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.080]   Earlier, we looked at 1 Peter 3, verses one to two,
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.120]   two verses about the husband-wife relationship
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.480]   and how a wife responds to her husband's
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.280]   ongoing sin patterns.
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.240]   That was APJ 1830.
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.440]   And we are back to this theme of a godly woman's influence,
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.320]   especially on her husband in 1 Peter 3, verses three to four.
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.760]   There's a connection in this verse about a wife's jewelry
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.320]   and her influence on her husband,
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.680]   an interesting connection made by Peter in his epistle
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.040]   and pointed out briefly by Pastor John in Monday's episode,
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.000]   a point expanded on in a sermon clip
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.280]   from a 1986 sermon by John Piper.
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.440]   Here he is to explain.
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.080]   - You remember what it says of Sarah in Hebrews 11?
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.040]   Hebrews 11 begins with a definition of faith.
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.840]   Faith is the assurance of things hoped for.
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.160]   And all you see through chapter 11
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.400]   is heroes and heroines who hope in God.
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.360]   For example, by faith, Sarah herself received power
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.920]   to conceive even when she was past the age,
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.920]   since she considered him faithful who had promised.
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.640]   In other words, we learn from Sarah
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.640]   that women who are holy look away from the frustrations,
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.280]   the miseries, the tragedies,
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.040]   the obstacles of joy in this life to God.
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.280]   And they reckon him faithful and sovereign and powerful
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.040]   and loving and kind and unfailing in his promises.
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.520]   And they strengthen their soul with hope
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.520]   and pick up and go on, dirty diapers and all,
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.880]   loss of husband, divorce, they go on
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.600]   because they hope in God.
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.920]   Not only that, but they are freed from something
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.120]   that tends to make life miserable.
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.920]   Look at verse six at the end.
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:32.080]   "And you women are now her children, Sarah's children,
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.520]   if you do right and let nothing terrify you."
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.560]   You wanna be a daughter of Sarah?
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.880]   Hope in God and allow that hope to drive fear out.
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.520]   Holy women aren't afraid of things,
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.160]   except one thing, displeasing God.
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.800]   Or let's not overstate the case.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.640]   Let's be accurate and realistic.
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:06.800]   Let's say it this way.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.440]   Holy women who hope in God,
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.360]   when fears and anxieties rise,
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.360]   make war on those fears with a weapon of the word
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.720]   until they drive it out and have hope filling them
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.520]   and thus gain strength to get on with life.
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.120]   That's number one in this text,
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.120]   holy women hope in God and allow no terror
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.840]   to immobilize them in their duties.
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.840]   Second, this hope in God results
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.760]   in a kind of clothing within.
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.800]   It says, "So holy women who hoped in God
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.440]   used to adorn themselves."
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.560]   And the adornment is referring back to verses three and four.
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.400]   Let's read it.
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.280]   Here's the description of the garment within.
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.120]   "Let not yours be the outward adorning
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.160]   with braiding of hair, decoration of gold,
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.680]   and wearing of robes,
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.440]   but let it be the hidden person of the heart
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.520]   with the imperishable jewel of a gentle and quiet,"
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.480]   or we could say a meek and tranquil, "spirit,
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:34.480]   which in God's sight is very precious."
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.440]   Now, why did Peter bring up the issue of clothes
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.200]   and hairstyles and jewelry?
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.120]   Doesn't seem to fit.
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.320]   Let me try to show you why I think he brought it up.
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.520]   I think verses one and two give us the clue
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.440]   that explain why he brings it up.
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.800]   He has in mind not only Christian wives
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:59.840]   of Christian husbands,
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.200]   but Christian wives of non-Christian husbands.
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.080]   And he says to them, "Likewise, you wives,
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.480]   be submissive to your husbands,
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.040]   so that some, though they do not obey the word,
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.880]   may be won without a word by the behavior of their wives
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.040]   when they see your reverent and chaste behavior."
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.760]   Now, it's Peter's desire
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:28.360]   that Christian wives live in such a way
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.360]   that unbelieving husbands will be persuaded
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.560]   that God is real.
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.120]   Isn't that an awesome challenge?
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.360]   To so live that the conscience of an unbelieving husband
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.320]   will be stricken with guilt.
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:52.320]   The reality of God will shine and he will embrace her God.
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:58.040]   It's an awesome call for this woman to influence her husband,
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.040]   but he warns them, "Don't preach at him."
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.960]   You see that?
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.040]   He says, "Without a word."
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.680]   That's a warning to the wives.
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.480]   Watch out, lest you drive him away
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.640]   by nagging him about religion, okay?
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:17.840]   I think verses three and four are another warning
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.960]   for how not to try to win an unbelieving husband.
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:26.960]   Namely, don't try to do it with trendy hairstyles,
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:32.640]   a better tan, delicate jewelry, clinging robes.
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.040]   You might attract him to the bedroom
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.760]   and there's nothing wrong with that,
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.600]   but you won't attract him to God.
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:47.840]   And if your goal is to attract him or anybody to God,
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:52.600]   it's gotta be from within.
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.800]   The world can tell you how to attract men to yourself.
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.920]   Only the scriptures can tell you how to attract men to God.
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:03.360]   And let me insert here for the single women,
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.960]   that your hope ought to be in God,
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.680]   not in getting a husband,
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:14.760]   because the only husband worth getting
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:19.600]   is one who wants to play second fiddle in your life.
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.800]   - That was from John Piper's 1986 sermon titled,
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.240]   "Holy Women Who Hoped in God,"
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.360]   a classic message on biblical femininity.
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.480]   And if you have a sermon clip to share with all of us,
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.960]   email me, give me your name, hometown, the sermon title,
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.800]   the timestamp of where the clip happens in the audio
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.360]   and make a note of what stands out to you.
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.160]   Put the word clip in the subject line of an email
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.440]   and send it to me at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:45.360]   That's an email address, askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:49.520]   Well, we've been picking on men recently on the podcast,
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:54.520]   but who is more sinful, men or women?
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:57.840]   Well, now that is a, it's an international question
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:58.960]   and it's up next time.
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:07:59.800]   I'm your host, Tony Reiki.
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.520]   We are rejoined in studio with Pastor John
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.800]   when we return on Friday.
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:05.760]   We'll see you then.
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:08.340]   (upbeat music)
[00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:10.920]   (upbeat music)
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:20.920]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
