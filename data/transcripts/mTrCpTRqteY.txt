[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   (music)
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Is faultless chastity, faultless chastity
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   too high a standard for pastors? That's today's question.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   And it's a question that reminds me of a personal experience. A few years ago
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   my family and I had slipped into the back of a church to see a preacher that I liked.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   The church was packed out, the elders were on the platform,
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   tissues were being passed, the preacher was not there.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   Moments after we had arrived it was announced that he
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   had been booted from his pastoral role the night before after the
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   discovery of his romantic attachment to a woman that was not his wife.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   And when this punishment was formally announced to the church
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   the man sitting directly in front of me, who I had never seen before, we had never met,
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   I didn't know him, he didn't know me, he turned straight around in his chair,
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   looked me dead in the eye and said in a loud voice, "That's over the top,
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   don't you think?" I was startled. I'll never forget that.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   But moments like these in really any formal church discipline is startling.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   You don't forget them. And they land on some people with a
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   shock of strictness. This is the experience
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   leading to today's question from a female listener in Houston.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   "Pastor John, one of the pastors in my church was recently dismissed from his position after confessing to
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   having had sex with a lady he was dating. On the one hand, I was
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   so humbled by the high view of God's standard taken by the church leadership,
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   but on the other hand, I wondered if this was too harsh. It takes a very special grace
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   to withstand sexual temptation, especially in a man or woman of a certain age and experience.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   And many pastors struggle with hidden sins, such as
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   pornography. My question is this, is faultless chastity
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   too high of a standard to hold for pastors?"
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Well, I start with the conviction that the
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   coming of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, into the world
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   and the revelation of the love of God in the
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   sacrifice of his Son and the pattern
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   of suffering and self-denial set by Jesus
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit as the Spirit of the
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   risen Christ and the vivid clarification
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   of the riches of the Christian inheritance beyond death
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   and the radical counter-cultural teachings of Jesus
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   on how Christians are to live and the establishment
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   of the new covenant in which the law is written
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   on our hearts. I start with the conviction
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   that all of these and more mean
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   that the standard of behavior for God's people
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   now are higher than they were
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   in the Old Testament. Jesus raised
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   the bar. He said, for example, "Because
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   of your hardness of heart, Moses allowed you to divorce
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   your wives, but from the beginning it wasn't so," Matthew
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   19:8. And then he called them to rise up
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   above the Mosaic compromise with sin.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   So, with that conviction,
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   I don't disagree that it takes, quote,
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   "a very special grace to withstand sexual
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   temptation." Indeed, it does. But my point is
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   this grace, this blood-bought
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   grace, this glorious new covenant
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   grace is available in Christ to all Christians.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   For example, 2 Corinthians 9.8.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   God is able to make all
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   grace abound to you, so that having all
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   sufficiency in all things at all times, you may
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   abound in every good work.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Every good work, which includes the very minimal
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   good works of staying out of bed with your girlfriend
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   until you're married, and then being faithful
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   to your wife after marriage—that's minimal good works.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Or 1 Corinthians 10.13.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   "No temptation has overtaken you that is not
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   common to man. God is faithful, and
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   that you may be able to endure it." In other words,
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   yes, yes, it requires great
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   grace to be chased—grace
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   beyond common grace. But that's the very
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   ocean we were thrown into
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   when we were united to Christ. Through
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   him we have obtained access by faith
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   into this grace in which we stand—I would say
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   in which we swim—an ocean. It's an ocean of grace.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   To be a Christian, living in this ocean
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   of almighty grace, is to be led by the Spirit.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Romans 8.14. "All who are led by the Spirit
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   are the sons of God." And, Galatians
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   5.23, "The fruit of the Holy Spirit is self-control."
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   And that word, "enkritia," refers explicitly to sexual
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   self-control, in Galatians 5.23.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Or Colossians 3.5, "Put to death, therefore, what is earthly
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   in you—sexual immorality, impurity, passion,
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   evil desire, covetousness, which is idolatry.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   On account of these, the wrath of God is coming."
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   Just like Jesus said, "Everyone who looks on a woman with lustful intent
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   has already committed adultery with her in his heart. If your right eye causes
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   you to sin, tear it out, throw it away, for it is better that you
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   lose one of your members than that your whole body be thrown into hell." So Jesus
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   and Paul talk about hell in
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   relationship to the failure to adapt,
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   adopt, receive, be empowered by this grace
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   that God has purchased for us in the new covenant.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   Then, after the conviction that Christ's standards
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   are higher than Moses' standards, there's the truth
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   that standards for elders and pastors
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   are higher than for ordinary Christian
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   church members. Besides the special
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   gifting required for elders and pastors called "teaching"
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   and "governing"—1 Timothy 3, 2, and 5—
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   there are ethical standards where the pastor is to be
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   above reproach—1 Timothy 3, 2—because
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   he's a very public figure
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   and has the weighty calling of being an example
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   to the flock—1 Peter 5, 3—and an example to the world—
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   1 Timothy 3, 7. "So I exhort the elders
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   among you, exercise oversight,
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   not domineering over those in your charge, but being
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   examples to the flock"—1 Peter 5.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   And Paul makes explicit that this
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   example that pastors are to set is
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   sexual purity. Set the believers an example
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith,
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   in purity—1 Timothy 4, 12.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   Show yourself in all respects to be a model
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   of good works so that an opponent
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   may be put to shame having nothing evil to say about us—
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   Titus 2, 6—all of which
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   leads to Paul's weighty words to the elders in Acts 20,
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   28, "Pay careful attention
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   to yourselves and to all the flock
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   to care for the church of God which he obtained
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   with his own blood"—Acts 20, 28.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   In spite of the fact that many pastors
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   try to give the impression, with misplaced humility,
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   that they are just one of the guys—
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   don't put me on a pedestal, I'm just one of the guys—they
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   are emphatically not just one of the guys.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   I'll say it again. Pastors are emphatically not
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   just one of the guys. They are the shepherd of
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   the guys. They are the wolf catchers and wolf fighters of the guys.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   They are the examples to the guys. They are the protectors and teachers
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   with authority over the guys. Maybe
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   one of our problems is that we've just scared pastors
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   witless about being what they ought to be.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   So what I'm suggesting is that
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   it is biblically inconceivable that
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   such a shepherd could be living above the standard
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   of Moses and above the standard of ordinary Christians
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   and above the reproach of the world and yet be
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   living in sexual sin. So my answer to the
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   question is that it is not too high a standard to
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   require that a pastor live a life free
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   from sexual fornication and adultery
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   and any ongoing use of pornography.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   Thank you for walking us through those texts, Pastor John, and thanks for sending in the question.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   We publish this podcast three times a week with over 1,500 episodes now in the archive.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   You can find them, you can subscribe to the podcast, or send me a question of your own.

[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   Well, how can I be freed from my obsession with my appearance?
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   It's an ever-important question today, and it's been a question since biblical times, too.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   And it's a question from an anonymous young woman who listens
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   to every podcast episode. No doubt listening right now.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   That's up next time. How can I be freed from my obsession with my appearance?
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   That's on the other side of the weekend. I'm Tony Reinke. We'll see you back here on Monday.
