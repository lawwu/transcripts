[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.760]   In the following sermon clip, Pastor John talks about what it means to have God's
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.960]   Word, His law, with us and His Spirit within us.
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:19.300]   The presence of the Holy Spirit changes everything about the Christian's obedience.
[00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:26.280]   The result is that we live off of the approval of God, not the approval of man.
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.360]   Here's what Pastor John said back in his sermon in 1999.
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.520]   I remember a day in seminary, 31 years ago, it was the fall of '68.
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:42.320]   My systematics theology teacher, Jim Morgan, was a big, strapping, strong 36-year-old man
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.520]   who died of stomach cancer in six months from this moment that I'm talking about.
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.520]   Shriveled up to nothing.
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.900]   It was the day of the Vietnam War and people were going barefoot to class and hitting the
[00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.920]   streets afterwards and Jim was a real radical.
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.940]   And one day we were in this heated conversation after class.
[00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.300]   I can picture it right by the refractory.
[00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.940]   I learned the word "refractory" at Fuller Seminary.
[00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.160]   It's where you eat.
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:16.140]   And there he stood and in the middle he stopped and he said, "John, I love Jesus Christ."
[00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.300]   It was an overwhelming sentence.
[00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.660]   I'd never heard a professor say that in my life.
[00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.900]   "I love Jesus Christ."
[00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.820]   It took my breath away.
[00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.020]   Do you feel some of that welling up inside of you?
[00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.740]   If you do, thank the Spirit.
[00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.540]   It doesn't come natural to love Jesus.
[00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.180]   Secondly, the law plus the Spirit results in an internal change of the heart that loves
[00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.060]   God and is circumcised.
[00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:52.420]   Law plus Spirit equals satisfaction in the praise of God, even if no man approves what
[00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.220]   you do.
[00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:01.300]   You can be content and satisfied because you know in Christ God says, "Well done, good
[00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.380]   and faithful servant.
[00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:08.500]   I can sweep all of your errors away because I paid for them with the blood of my Son.
[00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.500]   Well done."
[00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:18.780]   Isn't that great to know that even our sin-infected good deeds are going to be praised by God?
[00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.820]   That's awesome.
[00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.340]   You don't have to produce a perfect deed to get the praise of God because if you did,
[00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.820]   there would be no such thing as the praise of God.
[00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.820]   There won't be a perfect deed you've ever done until the twinkling of an eye changes
[00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.880]   you into the image of Jesus.
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:42.300]   But all the little contaminations or big contaminations of the good things you do are burned up in
[00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:49.100]   the fire of Calvary so that what's left, he will praise.
[00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:55.380]   And knowing that you will have his smile forever and there will be this mutual delight that
[00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:01.340]   goes on and on that so satisfies the heart of the saint that if nobody approves what
[00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.580]   you do, you're a rock.
[00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.220]   Don't be a second-hander.
[00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:13.780]   When I read "I and Ran Atlas Shrugged" twenty years ago, another thing emblazoned itself
[00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:20.420]   on my mind, her hatred of second-handers.
[00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.380]   Me too.
[00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.620]   That is, not the people, but the concept.
[00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:34.820]   That is, always choosing what you do and what you say not because of its intrinsic worth
[00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:40.940]   in the face of God, but because an eye is being cut to what they will think and say
[00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:41.940]   about it.
[00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:42.940]   That's a second-hander.
[00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.340]   Don't be that way.
[00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.940]   Be real with God.
[00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:54.940]   If you have God, if through Abraham you are a beneficiary of the covenant, I will be your
[00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:55.940]   God.
[00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:56.940]   You will be my people.
[00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.460]   Who cares what people think?
[00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:01.460]   So good.
[00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:05.020]   That was from John Piper's sermon, "Who is a True Jew?"
[00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.060]   Part 2.
[00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.320]   From his message on February 28, 1999.
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.300]   This clip was recommended to us by David Bolton.
[00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.080]   Thank you, David, for sending this in to us.
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:20.380]   You can download the full message and over 1,200 others from our website at DesiringGod.org.
[00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:26.300]   We've talked about this addiction to human approval back in episode number 141, an episode
[00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.800]   on why we can fall into the addiction of lying.
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.380]   You can find that in the podcast archive, episode number 141.
[00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.180]   We are going to close out the week with two important and very common questions we get
[00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.700]   from couples about marital intimacy.
[00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:42.700]   I'm your host Tony Rehnke.
[00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:43.340]   We'll see you tomorrow.
