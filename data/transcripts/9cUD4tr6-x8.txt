[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560]   A lot of people, they read about Steve Jobs and they're like, "Well, the secret to success
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.640]   is be this brilliant perfectionist who can always see the future and also be just a giant
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.360]   asshole to everyone you meet."
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.920]   And I'm going to try to do both of those things.
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.120]   And it turns out one of those is really, really easy to do.
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.960]   Thinking about his previous background where he worked at a prop trading firm and it seemed
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.040]   to do well there.
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.040]   It's Jane Street.
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.600]   They're very, very selective in who they hire.
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.600]   Very hard to get in.
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:32.000]   It's entirely possible that part of what happened was just that Jane Street has its operations
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.720]   people, they have their trading people, and there may have been enough siloing within
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:44.200]   that that if your job is just identify discrepancies in ETF prices and take advantage of them,
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.760]   you don't actually have to know things like, "How do we figure out which counterparties
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.760]   are creditworthy?
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:49.760]   How do we make sure we have enough liquidity?
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.040]   How do we have backup plans upon backup plans upon backup plans in case something goes wrong
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.720]   with our liquidity situation.
