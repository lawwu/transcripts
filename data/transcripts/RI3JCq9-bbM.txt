[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Silence]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Along the lines of choice, I'd like to shift gears slightly and talk about free will,
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   about our ability to make choices at all.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   Well, my personal way out and left field inflammatory stance is
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   I don't think we have a shred of free will.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   Despite 95% of philosophers and I think probably the majority of neuroscientists
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   saying that we have free will in at least some circumstances,
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   I don't think there's any at all.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   The reason for this is you do something, you behave, you make a choice, whatever,
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   and to understand why you did that, where did that intention come from,
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   part of it was due to the sensory environment you were in in the previous minute.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   Some of it is from the hormone levels in your bloodstream that morning.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   Some of it is from whether you had a wonderful or stressful last three months
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   and what sort of neuroplasticity happened.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   Part of it is what hormone levels you were exposed to as a fetus.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   Part of it is what culture your ancestors came up with
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   and thus how you were parented when you were a kid.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   All of those are in there and you can't understand where behavior is coming from
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   without incorporating all of those.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   And at that point, not only are there all of these relevant factors,
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   but they're ultimately all one factor.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   If you're talking about what evolution has to do with your behavior,
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   by definition you're also talking about genetics.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   If you're talking about what your genes have to do with behavior,
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   by definition you're talking about how your brain was constructed
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   or what proteins are coded for.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   If you're talking about like your mood disorder now,
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   you're talking about the sense of efficacy you were getting as a five-year-old.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   They're all intertwined and when you look at all those influences,
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   basically the challenge is show me a neuron that just caused that behavior
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   or show me a network of neurons that just caused that behavior
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   and show me that nothing about what they just did was influenced
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   by anything from the sensory environment one second ago
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   to the evolution of your species.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   And there's no space in there to fit in a free will concept
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   that winds up being in your brain but not of your brain.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   There's simply no wiggle room for it there.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   So I can appreciate that our behaviors and our choices are the consequence
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   of a long line of dominoes that fell prior to that behavior.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   But is it possible that I can intervene in the domino effect, so to speak?
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   In other words, can my recognition of the fact that genes have heritability,
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   there's an epigenome, that there's a hormonal context,
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   there's a historical context,
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   can the knowledge of that give me some small, small shard of free will?
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Meaning, does it allow me to say, ah, okay,
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   I accept that my choices are somewhat predetermined,
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   and yet knowing that gives me some additional layer of control.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Is there any philosophical or biological universe in which that works?
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   - Nah.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   All of that can produce the wonderfully positive belief that change can happen.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   Even traumatic change, even in the worst of circumstances,
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   most unlikely people, and change can happen.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Things can change.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Don't be fatalistic.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Don't decide because we're mechanistic biological machines that nothing can--
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   Change can happen.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   But where people go off the rails is translating that into,
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   we can change ourselves.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   We don't.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   We can't, because there's no free will.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   However, we can be changed by circumstance.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   And the point of it is, like, you look at an aplesia, a sea slug,
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   that has learned to retract its gill in response to a shock on its tail.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   You can do, like, conditioning, Pavlovian conditioning on it,
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   and it has learned its behavior has been changed by its environment.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   And you hear news about something, like, horrifically depressing going on,
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   and, you know, refugees in wherever.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   And as a result, you feel a little bit more helpless
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   and a less of a sense of efficacy in the world,
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   and both of your behaviors have been changed.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Okay, okay, yeah, I guess that's good.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   But the remarkable thing is, it's the exact same neurobiology.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   The signal transduction pathways that were happening in that sea snail
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   incorporate the exact same kinases and proteases and phosphatases
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   that we do when you're having mammalian fear conditioning.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Or when you're -- it's conserved.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   It's the exact same thing.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   It's simply playing out in, obviously, a much, much fancier domain.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   And because you have learned that change is possible,
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   despite understanding mechanistically
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   that we can't change ourselves volitionally,
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   but because you understand change is possible,
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   you have just changed the ability of your brain
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   to respond to optimistic stimuli.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   And you have changed the ability of your brain
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   to now send you in the direction of being exposed to more information
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   that will seem cheerful rather than depressing.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Oh, my God, that's amazing what Nelson Mandela
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   and Martin Luther King and all these folks did.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   Wow, under the most adverse of circumstances, they were able to do it.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   Maybe I can also.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Maybe I can go read more about people like them
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   to get even more data points of changed neurochemistry
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   so that your responses are different now.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   And, you know, you're tilted a little bit more in that direction
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   of feeling like you can make a difference
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   instead of it's all damn hopeless.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   So enormous change can happen,
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   but the last thing that could come out of a view of
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   we are nothing more or less than the sum of our biology
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   and its interaction with the environment
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   is to throw up your hands and say,
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   and thus it's no use trying to change anything.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   So we can acknowledge that change is extremely hard to impossible,
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   that circumstances can change,
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   and yet that striving to be better human beings
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   is still a worthwhile endeavor.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   Do I have that correct?
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   Absolutely, because simply the knowledge either from experience
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   or making it to the end of the right neurobiology class
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   has taught you that change can happen
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   within a framework of a mechanistic neurobiology.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   You are now more open to being made optimistic
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   by the good news in the world around you.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   You are more likely to be inspired by this or that.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   You are more resistant to getting discouraged by bad news
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   simply because you now understand it's possible.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   [music]
