[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.220]   Welcome back to Portfolio Rescue. Portfolio Rescue here is the Ask the Compound show at
[00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.360]   gmail.com. Today's show is sponsored by Innovator ETFs. Duncan, this is an interesting one.
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:31.040]   It came out hot off the presses, a new ETF from Innovator ETFs that actually allows you
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.320]   to hedge an individual stock position. They do Tesla on a quarterly basis. You could buy
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:43.160]   this TSLH, and it caps your losses at 10% per quarter, and it also caps your gains at
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.440]   right around 10%. If you say, "I want to invest in Tesla, but I cannot handle the volatility,"
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.320]   because I think the volatility is three to four times that of the S&P 500. You say, "I
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.440]   want to invest in this company, but I can't handle it," you're actually protected, and
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.960]   your floor of losses is 10%. Of course, it caps you on the upside, too. They're using
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.440]   options to do this at Innovator ETFs. It's really interesting, the fact that you can
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.520]   do this. A lot of the money is actually invested in T-bills, and then the rest is invested
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.640]   in options on Tesla. Basically, help you contain those really deep drawdowns, because obviously
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.360]   some of these individual stocks can do that, and take a little bit of advantage of their
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.280]   growth. What do you think?
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.240]   That's pretty cool. It's like your own little hedge fund, kind of sounds like.
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.360]   Yes, it really is. The stuff that they're able to do these days with options and ETFs
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.400]   that we just couldn't do in the past is pretty interesting. If you want to learn more, go
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.800]   to InnovatorETFs.com. We got a lot of good questions. I just want to start out with one
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:42.400]   for you today, Duncan. Just some housekeeping here. Next week, we're not going to have a
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.960]   show. A lot of people at the compound are taking some vacations. I'm going up to God's
[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.120]   Country in Northern Michigan for a few days. I'm going to go to Mackinac Island, the place
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.080]   where you take a ferry there, and then no cars. It's only horse and carriage. You ever
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.080]   heard of this place?
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.080]   I have not heard of this.
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.680]   It's got a lot of history, a lot of tourists there. It's good for about one day. Duncan
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.440]   is going on his honeymoon. Here's my question for you, Duncan. You're going over to London.
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.840]   What are you most looking forward to spending your money on? Because I think it's important
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.980]   for people to spend their money on things they enjoy. You're going on your honeymoon.
[00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.640]   What are you most looking forward to spending your money on?
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:11.640]   That's a tough one.
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.640]   Food, beverages?
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.060]   Probably the food. We were talking in the chat with some people a week or two ago, but
[00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.080]   London is the vegan capital of the world, pretty much.
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.080]   Oh, really?
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.960]   There's going to be all kinds of great food that I'm looking forward to.
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.160]   What are the big tourist attractions you're going to go see?
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:36.200]   I'm going to see the Tower Bridge. I'm a big Whistler fan, so I want to go see where he
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:42.600]   painted a couple of scenes around the city. Then we're going to Liverpool for a night.
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:48.360]   We're going to Glasgow and Edinburgh. I'm Scottish on one side of my family, so I'm
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.520]   going to go connect with my homeland kind of stuff.
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.520]   It should be fun.
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.520]   Cool. All right. You've seen National Lapoon's European Vacation?
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.520]   I don't think so, actually.
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.080]   Look, kids, Big Ben. They get stuck in a circle looking at Big Ben over and over.
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.080]   No, I haven't seen that.
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.080]   Put it on your airplane list. All right. No show next week. We'll be back the following
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.980]   week. We're all taking some vacation here. Let's get right into it and do a quick question.
[00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.980]   First up today, many are saying -- this kind of made me laugh, because isn't this what
[00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.320]   Trump always said? Many are saying that real estate is the only way to get a real return
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:24.120]   in a safe manner. Will you post some data on real estate versus bonds versus stocks?
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:30.040]   Intuitively, this one makes sense. I've talked in the past about how real estate is a good
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.900]   hedge against inflation if you have a fixed rate mortgage. But even going beyond that,
[00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.400]   if you think about the fact that when inflation is spiking higher, materials costs go up because
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.320]   the cost of commodities are going up and then wages go up.
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.240]   So if you think the cost of building a house is up because material costs are up and wages
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:50.480]   are up for construction workers, that would make sense that houses now are more expensive,
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:56.160]   but also the house that you own in relation is probably worth more just to meet that level.
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.140]   So that makes sense. But let's dig into the numbers, because I've looked at this through
[00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.960]   stocks before in the past. So if we look at -- I got data from 1928 to 1921 from Robert
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.260]   Shiller. So the annual nominal returns for stocks and bonds is like 10 percent. Bonds
[00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.060]   is 4.8 percent and housing is 4.1 percent. Now, this shows what happens when inflation
[00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.600]   is rising or falling from one year to the next. You can see when inflation is rising
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.720]   from one year to the next, stock and bond returns are below average. Housing is above
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.120]   average. When inflation is falling, stock and bond returns are above average and housing
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.640]   is below average. Same thing. Inflation I put here at above or below average is 3 percent
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.340]   because that's a long term, like a hundred year average. And kind of the same thing for
[00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.320]   stocks and housing. Inflation is above average. Stocks do poorly. Housing does well. Inflation
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.720]   is below average. Stocks do well. Housing does poorly. Bonds are a little different.
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.540]   I think the biggest reason for bonds when inflation is above 3 percent doing better
[00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.980]   is because in the 80s and 90s rates were so high and inflation was actually a little higher.
[00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:59.240]   So this actually bears out. When inflation is falling below average, stocks outperform
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.600]   the long term averages. When inflation is rising and above average, housing outperforms
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.360]   long term averages. Now, these are nominal returns. Let's look at it by an inflation
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:12.940]   regime. So, John, focus next chart. This shows by decade on a real basis what the annual
[00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.460]   returns were for stocks, bonds and housing. Stocks is the S&P 500. Bonds is 10 year treasuries
[00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.640]   and housing is the Case-Shiller data, which he has going back to like the 1800s. But you
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:26.740]   can see on a real basis when inflation has been high, 1940s inflation was 5.5 percent.
[00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:32.780]   Housing had the best real returns of any decade. 70s inflation was 7 percent. Housing outperformed
[00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.100]   by 1.3 percent when stocks and bonds were down on a real basis. This doesn't always
[00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:40.780]   work because in the 2010s inflation was very low and housing still did well. But that probably
[00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:45.460]   says more about the timing than anything, because that's when the housing market bottomed
[00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:52.900]   pretty much. So housing is a really good inflation hedge. Now, here's the caveat this time around.
[00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.760]   There may have been so much pull forward. I don't know if it's going to work going forward
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.620]   from here. So I looked at the decades, the 30s through the 2010s. So if we look at just
[00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:07.820]   the 2020s. So it's 2020 to Robert Shiller's data is only updated through February of 2022.
[00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:12.420]   He's a little slow, frankly, for my taste in updating his data. But he's a Nobel Prize
[00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:19.220]   winner. He's got other stuff to do. So in those 26 months on a real basis after inflation,
[00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:26.300]   housing is up 21 percent. That's higher than seven out of the last nine decades in just
[00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:32.340]   a little over two years. So we've already had an enormous gain above inflation for housing.
[00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:37.620]   And so bigger than anything we've ever seen in that shorter period of time. And and so
[00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.580]   you could say it's about inflation. A lot of it is probably more about the pandemic
[00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:45.060]   and demographics and household formation. But it's hard to see it going forward, keeping
[00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:49.500]   that that inflation hedge. But yes, housing historically has been a very good inflation
[00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.060]   hedge.
[00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:55.300]   You know what has not seemed to be that great of an inflation hedge is the housing stocks
[00:06:55.300 --> 00:07:01.420]   like Zillow and Redfin. You guys on Animal Spirits were talking about that.
[00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:06.760]   Redfin is down like 92 percent. Zillow, yeah, was down 70 or 80 percent. This is why I like
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:11.340]   the disconnect between corporations in the stock market versus the real thing in housing.
[00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:16.900]   It's not even close to the same thing. Right. But yeah. But an individual house, if you're
[00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:20.180]   and if you're someone who's doing this on, like if this person is thinking in terms of
[00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:24.660]   rentals, obviously you can raise your rent as well. So that that's what makes housing.
[00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:28.100]   It's that imputed rent. That's a big thing, too. So, yeah. And some people enjoy being
[00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:34.420]   a landlord. Right. Yeah, I wouldn't personally, but I don't think I would. Yeah. All right.
[00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:38.580]   Let's do another one. OK.
[00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:42.700]   So up next, we have a question from Michael and some people might recognize this one from
[00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:46.180]   what are your thoughts, but we're doing a deeper dive. As a long term investor with
[00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:50.500]   a 10 to 20 year horizon, is it a good idea to sell portions of a stock when it's up and
[00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:56.060]   take some profits, maybe reinvest when the price goes down or just pocket the gains?
[00:07:56.060 --> 00:08:00.420]   Or is it best to stay all in regardless of the ups and downs?
[00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:05.220]   This question is basically asking, should I rebalance? Right. Should I take a little
[00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:08.620]   of what's done well and trim a little bit, take some profits? What's the quote? No one's
[00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:12.520]   ever gone broke taking a profit. Right. I think Kramer says that it's a it's a trader
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:17.620]   thing to say. It sounds it sounds intelligent or just let things ride and just go with it.
[00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:24.380]   Obviously, there's a difference between individual stocks and owning the market as a whole. So
[00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:27.340]   William Bernstein wrote the original blog post way back in the day. This is from like
[00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:32.380]   1996 and his blog called The Efficient Frontier. And he wrote this post called The Rebalancing
[00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:36.300]   Bonus. And he calculated that the bump in return from rebalancing, looking at it, look
[00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:39.340]   at how old this is. William Bernstein was like the OG financial blogger. He wrote this
[00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:43.020]   way back in the day. By far my favorite financial writer of anyone. I've learned more from him
[00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:46.300]   than I have from anyone, I think, in the in the investing world. So he calculated the
[00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:50.140]   bump in returns from rebalancing your portfolio is like point five percent annually, which
[00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:54.780]   doesn't sound like a lot. But over the over the long term compounds pretty well. The way
[00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:59.740]   that I look at it is the reason that you diversify in the first place and set an asset allocation
[00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:03.140]   is because it matches your risk profile and your time horizon and kind of gives you a
[00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:06.580]   portfolio you can stick with over the long term. So why set an asset allocation in the
[00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:12.260]   first place if you're not going to rebalance over some time frame? Right. And even if rebalancing
[00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:16.560]   doesn't provide some sort of bonus over time, because sometimes the timing could be off.
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:20.980]   It's a way to control for risk. Unfortunately, the reason that you rebalance in the first
[00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:25.940]   place is because nothing grows to the sky. Right. Markets are always in forever cyclical.
[00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:30.060]   Things go up, things go down. And that's why you rebalance, because nothing that nothing
[00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:34.340]   works forever. Right. Tech stocks. Everyone said, why don't I put all my tech stocks for
[00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:37.100]   10 years and then look what happened on the other side of that. You want to take some
[00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:41.300]   of those profits eventually by selling a little bit of what's gone well, buying a little bit
[00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:45.860]   what hasn't gone well and putting it back into into sort of symbiosis in your portfolio.
[00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:50.120]   Now, the problem with the regression to meet regression to the mean as a concept is it
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:53.820]   sounds beautiful until you actually look at the data, because sometimes it just doesn't
[00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:57.620]   work. It doesn't follow a set pattern. So I looked at the 10 best and 10 worst years
[00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:01.380]   in the stock market history. So, John, pull up the 10 best. This is the 10 best years
[00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:05.820]   since 1926. And what I did was I looked at the prior year and then the following year
[00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:10.620]   to see what happens. You can see sometimes the best years are followed by some really
[00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:17.100]   bad years. So 1975, that was following a really nasty turn in 73 and 74. 1958 was followed
[00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:21.920]   by it was following an 11 percent down draft. But sometimes those best returns come after
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:26.100]   a really good return. So in the 1920s, you had a really good return. It was followed
[00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:30.820]   up by an even better return. Right. Sometimes after a really good return, you see a nasty
[00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:37.600]   loss. Right. 1936 was really good. 1937 was a crash. 1945 was really good. Then you had
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:41.260]   an 8 percent downturn. Same thing for 1928. And then sometimes you have a really good
[00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:46.380]   return that just keeps going up. So it's kind of the same thing in the worst year. So, John,
[00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:51.700]   put the chart on the worst years. Right. So these are the 10 worst years since 1926. See,
[00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:54.500]   sometimes they follow a really good year. Sometimes they follow bad years. Sometimes
[00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:56.780]   those really bad years are followed by good years. Sometimes they're followed by even
[00:10:56.780 --> 00:11:02.640]   worse years. Duncan, can you imagine? So these are like the who's who of worst returns ever.
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:06.820]   So this year, let's say the stock market is down 15 to 20 percent, depending on what day
[00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:11.020]   you're looking at. Right. And what what time frame you're looking at. So let's say we finish
[00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:15.300]   the year down 15 percent. Can you imagine being down 20 percent again next year like
[00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:19.620]   that? It's rare for it to happen, but it's not out of the realm of possibilities. It
[00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:23.020]   happens on occasion. There are times when you can have two double digit down years in
[00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:27.380]   a row, maybe three down years in a row. It's not. But so the problem is, there's no pattern.
[00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:31.020]   So the question is, I'm going to rebalance. What is my interval? And the answer is, it
[00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:35.340]   doesn't matter. You could do semi annually. You could rebalance on an annual basis. You
[00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:38.980]   could even wait two to three years sometimes to allow momentum to take effect. The problem
[00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:44.980]   is or you could do the bands. You say, I'm going to let my asset weights go 5 percent
[00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:49.660]   or 10 percent outside of their band. So if I say 50 percent allocation to U.S. stocks,
[00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:53.300]   if it goes to 45, I'm going to buy. If it goes to 55, I'm going to sell. The thing is,
[00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:56.580]   whatever you choose, you just have to pick a strategy that you're going to follow without
[00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:59.940]   hesitation. And probably you should probably automate it, whatever one you choose, because
[00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:02.700]   sometimes rebalancing is going to make you look a genius and you're going to you're going
[00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:06.380]   to buy stocks and they're down. Sometimes you're going to sell stocks when they're up
[00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:09.700]   and then they keep going up. So the thing is, you just have to kind of be consistent
[00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:15.540]   and stick with it. And again, with individual stocks, all bets are off the table as far
[00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:20.460]   as regression to the mean. It doesn't work quite as easily or quite as good. So yeah,
[00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:26.260]   probably taking profits there makes more sense. But I think if you can find a fund or a strategy
[00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.380]   that automatically rebalances, that's probably the best case scenario.
[00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:36.460]   Yeah, I think also the individual and what their goals are, it matters so much for this.
[00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:41.740]   You're obviously not necessarily talking about a college student who took $50 and doubled
[00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:46.060]   it on Robinhood or something. That's a little different scenario than, "Oh, should I take
[00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:47.060]   profits?"
[00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:51.140]   Are there certain stock picks that you could say, "This is going to be a buy and hold forever"?
[00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:54.940]   That's fine. But just the point is to set that strategy ahead of time and don't try
[00:12:54.940 --> 00:13:00.300]   to figure it out when it's happening. If your stock is down 50% today and you said, "Well,
[00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:03.100]   it's a buy and hold forever when I bought it." Now today you go, "Eh, maybe I should
[00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:06.620]   sell and rebalance." That's the problem, is wavering and going back. That doesn't mean
[00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:11.820]   you can't change your mind, but it's just important to have a strategy going into it.
[00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:17.340]   Even a bad plan is better than no plan at all, is what I say. All right, let's do another
[00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:18.340]   one.
[00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:23.620]   Okay. Also, someone complained about me saying, "Okay," too much. It's a transition. You and
[00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:27.900]   Michael were talking about transitions yesterday on Animal Spirits. It's my transition as we're
[00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:33.540]   waiting on the next question to pop up. So, chill out. It's okay.
[00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:39.820]   Next up, we have, "Hi, Ben. In early January my portfolio was $150,000. In February I received
[00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:46.020]   $200,000 and did a lump sum investment into an index fund. Now I'm down 25%. Can I still
[00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:50.260]   reach my goal in 20 years from now, or did I make a mistake?"
[00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:55.540]   The important thing is here, nice job for you for more than doubling your portfolio
[00:13:55.540 --> 00:14:00.140]   with some sort of inheritance or bonus or whatever it is. Twenty years is a long time.
[00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:03.620]   I want to talk about process over outcome. So, there's this book, The Power of Habit
[00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:09.260]   by Charles Duhigg. It's seven or eight years old, probably. One of the better non-fiction
[00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:13.660]   books I've read in a while. He had this chapter on Tony Dungy. He was a former coach at the
[00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:17.620]   Tampa Bay Bucs, then he went on to win a Super Bowl in Indianapolis Colts. He talked about
[00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:21.940]   how when he first got to the Bucs, they were like a laughingstock. They were a terrible
[00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:28.500]   team. What he tried to instill in them was this idea of process over outcomes. Every
[00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:31.660]   day in practice, they would do the same thing over and over again. They said, "We don't
[00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:34.300]   care what everyone else does. We're going to do what we do, and we're going to do it
[00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:37.420]   well." Then they would get into the games, and that's stuff that they tried to hammer
[00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:42.100]   home in practice that guys wouldn't do. He'd ask his team, "You did this in practice every
[00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:46.540]   single day. Why did you do something different in the game?" The players would be like, "Well,
[00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:50.060]   I kind of felt like I had to step it up, and I had to really try harder. It was a critical
[00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:55.740]   play, so I went back to my gut instinct." He said, "No, no. This is the quote." What
[00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:58.300]   they were really saying was, they trusted our system most of the time, but everything
[00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:00.660]   was on the line. That belief broke down.
[00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:05.320]   I think thinking in terms of process over outcomes is really important when investing.
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:09.900]   You can't be outcome-oriented. Obviously, unfortunately, there is a scoreboard there.
[00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:13.420]   You can see, if you make a decision in an investment, you buy something, you sell something,
[00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:16.260]   you can see that you're either happy about it, or you regret it, or whatever, because
[00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:21.940]   that scoreboard is there. I think making these decisions like that, you use probabilities.
[00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:25.780]   If you decided that a lump sum was the best one for you, a decision at the time, I don't
[00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:29.940]   think you can say, "The stock market fell, so it was the wrong decision."
[00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:33.980]   I did this little list of what it means to be a process-oriented investor. I did a blog
[00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:38.340]   post about this in the past, and I kind of summarized it here. I think being process-oriented
[00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:42.620]   means that you diagnose problems before you prescribe solutions. A lot of people don't
[00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:45.900]   do this. They say, "This is exactly what you need to invest in right now, no matter what."
[00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:49.420]   I think that you can't give that advice to everyone. I think you have to focus on the
[00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:52.720]   present as opposed to fighting the last war. I think a lot of investors do that, and that's
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:55.820]   probably going to happen with inflation in the years ahead. People are going to be creating
[00:15:55.820 --> 00:16:00.780]   portfolios to fight inflation for years and years, even after it goes away or comes down.
[00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:04.920]   I think you have to have a plan in place instead of just having tactics. I think tactics sound
[00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:08.760]   great in the moment, and most of the time, they're useless unless they're not in the
[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:09.780]   concert of a whole plan.
[00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:12.900]   They're usually, it seems like they're reactionary, usually, right?
[00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:17.980]   Yes. I don't think, that's not the way that you want to invest. Not everyone here is a
[00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:22.340]   hedge fund manager, right? Then I think you have to define your investing philosophy before
[00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:27.300]   implementing specific investment strategies. Again, I think if you decided at the time,
[00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:31.380]   "This was the best move for me," I don't think you can say, "The stock market goes up 20%,
[00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:38.500]   I was right. If it goes down 20%, I was wrong." Again, if you have 20 years, so my most famous
[00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:42.460]   blog post is about a guy named Bob who invested at the peak of the market every time. He made
[00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:46.180]   four invests over the course of his 40 years, and every one of them was at a peak. He still
[00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:48.500]   retired with a million dollars because he kept his money in.
[00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:53.340]   I think as long as you keep that 20-year time horizon in the stock market, even though you
[00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:56.820]   did it right before a bear market, you're going to be fine. You just have to wait it
[00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:01.380]   out a little. Patience is the ultimate equalizer when it comes to investing.
[00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:05.980]   Yes. It's something that is so personality-driven. I think it's hard for some people to wrap
[00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:13.620]   their heads around. Yes, it feels bad. When you're beyond or whatever, drops 50% over
[00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:18.060]   the course of a couple of months, you want to start making a bunch of moves and that
[00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:23.340]   kind of thing. In hindsight, I probably should have. Anyway, for the sake of the point, it's
[00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:28.340]   not necessarily the best option to be changing up your thesis every time a stock drops.
[00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:34.020]   Unfortunately, there's no 0% or 100% when it comes to investing. There's no always or
[00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:39.900]   whatever. It's always somewhere in between. You just try to make high-probability bets
[00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:43.380]   as much as you can. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. But I think that doesn't mean
[00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:47.260]   you give up on it because it's a high-probability bet and it didn't work out once.
[00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:51.020]   That's why I only pick winners now. That's easy.
[00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:57.620]   Up next, we have a question from Greg. "My wife has a six-figure IRA recently converted
[00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:03.620]   from an employer's 401(k). She won't be obligated to take RMDs, that's Required Minimum Distributions."
[00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:04.620]   Is that right?
[00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:06.220]   Lewis: That's right. You got it.
[00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:10.240]   "She won't be required to take those anytime soon, but in the interest of minimizing taxes
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:15.440]   over the long haul, would it make sense to transfer in kind some portion of the IRA balance
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:20.100]   into a taxable account and take the taxable income hit now, while the IRA's investment
[00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:24.540]   value -- target-day funds -- has been substantially reduced by the bear market?"
[00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:29.460]   Lewis: Let's bring in everyone's favorite tax advisor for this one, Bill Sweet.
[00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:37.860]   Bill, not many investors are looking to pay taxes ahead of schedule. Is a bear market
[00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:42.860]   the only time to do this, or do you simply allow those tax deferrals to compound and
[00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:46.300]   say, "Okay, I see what you're trying to do. You're trying to game the system, but it probably
[00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:48.100]   doesn't matter if you have a certain time horizon."
[00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:52.740]   Yeah, this is a great question from Mr. Fitz, but I want to start with where you guys started
[00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:58.300]   the show, talking about ferries to private islands, horses and carriages, Big Ben Parliament.
[00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:03.660]   Once again, with this Midwestern bias, looking down at us humble, purple-collar workers here
[00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:05.580]   in New York City, it hurts.
[00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:09.900]   Lewis: Hey, I'm saying, Mackinac Island, you would like it, because it used to actually
[00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:12.380]   be a fort. There's a lot of military history there.
[00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:13.380]   You're coming out of this.
[00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:16.960]   Well, now you're speaking my language. Yeah, a lot going on there in the French and Indian
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:22.700]   Wars. But no, I love this idea from Mr. Fitz, and I hate to just twist everything and take
[00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:26.060]   a listener's question and just modify it based on what I want to talk to, but I'm going to
[00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:28.940]   do exactly that right now. Ben, what's the tattoo on my back?
[00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:30.180]   Roth IRA.
[00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:35.100]   Roth IRA conversion. Why would you take assets in a tax-deferred account and convert them
[00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:39.340]   into taxable future dollars if you don't need the money right now, right? So this, to me,
[00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:43.460]   Mr. Fitz, this is the perfect scenario for a Roth IRA conversion, so let's talk about
[00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:44.460]   it.
[00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:48.340]   As you know, if we have a traditional IRA, a traditional 401(k), that is tax-deferred,
[00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:53.500]   right? You do not pay tax on any of that income until you distribute it out of the account,
[00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:57.500]   and that's what Mr. Fitz is contemplating here. What Roth conversions allow you to do
[00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:02.380]   is time when the taxes happen. Maybe you want to pay some of that tax now, as Mr. Fitz said,
[00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:06.540]   for one of two reasons. Let's say the market's declined. That's a pretty good reason to me
[00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:10.580]   if you expect to have a rebound in the future, or if your tax rate is low now, you expect
[00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:14.540]   it to be maybe a little higher later. That makes a lot of sense to me. And Ben, what
[00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:18.260]   has the last six months of investing been for your average investor? It's not been a
[00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:19.260]   fun time, right?
[00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:20.260]   Not great.
[00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:25.660]   Yeah, so I think this is a great opportunity for Mr. Fitz. And to sort of illustrate why,
[00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:30.140]   John, let's go to the charts, man. Let's do this thing. So this is a very quick scenario
[00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:34.140]   that I want to illustrate of, let's just say, a half-million-dollar account divided by 10
[00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:38.620]   if you have 50,000, multiply it times 10 if you're very fortunate. The math still works.
[00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:43.260]   So let's just say from 2021 to now, we had a 20% decline, right? I think that's more
[00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:49.640]   or less the median account, given what's happened here in the last year. And now we're 20% lower.
[00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:52.480]   So now we have this opportunity to convert. But let's say we don't convert. I want to
[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:57.040]   lay that scenario out first. And then five years from now, just for hypothetical reasons,
[00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:02.460]   we distribute all the assets. What happens? Our account grows to $644,000. We have to
[00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:08.300]   eat $230,000 of deferred tax. That's $400,000 net after tax, right? Not a terrible deal
[00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:12.180]   in the grand scheme of things. Let's flip over to chart two.
[00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:16.420]   So all the same investment returns. The conditions are the same. The difference in this scenario
[00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:20.940]   is you convert half of the assets. You basically take $200,000 of your $400,000, you pay the
[00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:25.740]   tax now, you eat some of that now by $80,000, and then you distribute the entire balance
[00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:30.040]   again to get an apples-to-apples comparison after five years. You have now increased your
[00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:35.020]   after-tax return by almost 21% just by leveraging the tax code.
[00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:43.780]   All right. So my wife has a 401(k). She's been sitting on it for a while. I need to
[00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:49.500]   roll it over. I just haven't done it because inertia. So we need you to run the numbers
[00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:53.780]   for me on whether that makes sense when I roll it over to do a Roth conversion, or at
[00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:56.700]   least partial Roth conversion, right? I'll pay those taxes.
[00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:59.940]   We'll show you in the next episode. What I would need to know is how much is this
[00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:05.740]   private island costing you? That's the key question that I would need to understand.
[00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:07.780]   That's the key thing. I can't believe I missed this one. So the
[00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:11.660]   Roth is a way better option than going to some sort of taxable account?
[00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:15.740]   Yeah, definitely. Definitely. And this is a very common theme. I mean, nine out of 10
[00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:18.780]   questions, right, that I end up answering this show have to do with Roth conversions.
[00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:21.020]   So hence the tattoo. All right.
[00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:25.940]   How long until they crack down and stop this? Because it sounds too good to be true.
[00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:29.460]   I'm glad you asked that, Duncan. The answer to that is coming up later. But yeah, that
[00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:32.700]   was actually something that we were nervous about, that they would basically sort of stop
[00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:36.540]   this, particularly for high-income taxpayers. But it looks like the answer is no time soon.
[00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:39.380]   OK. All right. You're not going to believe this,
[00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:43.260]   though. This next question is about Roth IRAs. People love their Roth.
[00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:45.860]   Yeah, me too. All right. Up next, we have a question from
[00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:52.540]   Austin. "I'm 25 and fortunate to max out my Roth 401(k), HSA, and Roth IRA contributions
[00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:58.620]   each year through Vanguard, who is also my employer. I have $35,000 in pre-tax 401(k)
[00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:04.460]   holdings and $40,000 in a Roth. How can I best transition into more Roth exposure, especially
[00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:09.700]   in the IRA, since I plan to use these funds for first-time home purchases or expenses
[00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:14.540]   and a future college fund? Would converting traditional 401(k) to a traditional IRA and
[00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:19.140]   using a backdoor Roth conversion be the best option during this downturn? I understand
[00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:22.980]   five years is needed prior to withdrawal for backdoor route."
[00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:28.060]   First of all, Austin is my personal finance hero. He's a boglehead. He's maxing out his
[00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:30.900]   retirement accounts. I just want to remind Austin to enjoy some of your money, too. Don't
[00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:35.820]   save it all. But really nicely done at 25. Bill, since you're third born, is going to
[00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:40.660]   be named Roth Suite. I'm sure you can get on board with this one. But when do you think
[00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:44.460]   it's a good strategy to use Roth for these types of goals? So they're talking about first-time
[00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:48.220]   home expenses and future college funds. Does that make sense? Because I know you can take
[00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:52.380]   the contributions out tax-free. Is that a good savings vehicle for something like that?
[00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:56.420]   Yeah, it's interesting because it's really flexible. And I think that's the key benefit
[00:23:56.420 --> 00:24:01.300]   that you would have of using that in that, you're right, Ben, any basis that you have
[00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:05.660]   in a Roth IRA of your contributions, conversions are a little different. I'm going to talk
[00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:10.780]   about that in a second. But your contributions, you can access those completely income tax-free
[00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:16.060]   due to the very favorable ordering of how Roth IRA distributions occur on the tax code.
[00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:19.480]   I don't want to get too much into the details, but the idea is you can always get your basis
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:24.860]   back tax-free. And so if you use it for a home purchase, if you use those assets for
[00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:29.080]   a college or any other expense that you end up not paying any tax, you just have to leave
[00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:33.340]   the earnings alone. I think that's the key thing to think about. But time value of money,
[00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:37.680]   we do expect assets to appreciate over time. I don't think it's a bad strategy. The problem
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:42.700]   is if you have other tax advantage vehicles, I think you should consider those. I think
[00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:48.100]   I would use the Roth distribution as a plan, as a backstop, because ultimately that future
[00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:53.600]   tax-free compounding is very, very valuable. And as the taxpayer is realizing, it's hard
[00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:57.340]   to get assets into Roth. That's difficult. I have a couple of ideas for them, though,
[00:24:57.340 --> 00:25:01.340]   to talk about. But does that answer that question, Ben, that you asked about? Yeah. How? What
[00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:07.140]   are you thinking? So the first thing I would think about is like, look, we just went through
[00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:10.500]   the benefits of conversion, right? We don't have to discuss that anymore. I think in a
[00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:14.600]   down market and if you expect assets to rebound, you have a good thing going there. Let's talk
[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:22.620]   about what we've in the past referred to super, mega, ultra, pick your moniker, Roth 401(k)s.
[00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:28.600]   And so $20,500 is the 402(g) salary deferral limit in 401(k) plans. However, there's another
[00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:34.340]   limit, $61,000, that applies to all the contributions, including your employer match. Vanguard, great
[00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:37.720]   company, great partner to Ritholtz Wealth Management. I'm a company man. We are big
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:41.760]   fans of Vanguard. Ben, has any company, I think, done more to kind of change the investing
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:45.240]   world than Vanguard? They're at the top of my list. No. I love Vanguard, yes. They've
[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:49.200]   saved investors countless billions of dollars over the years, trillions maybe. I don't know.
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:53.120]   It's, yes. John Vogel is a saint. Yeah, more so the impact on, yeah, on, and they should
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:56.980]   be sponsoring Portfolio Rescue. We need to have a chat with the marketing folks. But
[00:25:56.980 --> 00:26:02.100]   moving that aside, the, some certain plans, certain 401(k) plans do allow you to contribute
[00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:06.900]   up to that $61,000 limit in excess of your salary deferral limit. The mechanics are a
[00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:12.140]   little funky, but the idea is if you can fund up to that 61(k), you do that, you immediately
[00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:16.760]   convert those assets to a Roth 401(k) if that's allowed, and now you've more or less tripled
[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:20.980]   your 401(k) contribution every year. And the added benefit is that additional after-tax
[00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:25.500]   money, if you roll it over quickly, can be completely tax-deferred into a Roth, and then
[00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:30.360]   you can roll that into IRA. It's a really super-charged way. Not every plan offers it.
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:34.860]   I would sort of look at the Vanguard SPD to see if it's allowed. Given how smart Vanguard
[00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:38.340]   is, I would guess that it's allowed. So I would point the taxpayer in that direction.
[00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:42.700]   That's a great way to supercharge. The other quick answers, though, for college expenses,
[00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:47.820]   529s are great. I'm in New York State. I get a $10,000 a year tax deduction if I max fund
[00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:52.780]   a 529. Many states offer that. And then all of the distributions are completely tax-free.
[00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:56.480]   You don't have to worry about threading the needle with things like, "What is my basis
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:00.860]   in this Roth?" which is very difficult when you get to the distribution phase.
[00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:03.580]   My eight-year-old tells me she's going to become a YouTube influencer someday, so she
[00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:05.700]   doesn't need a college fund anymore.
[00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:12.660]   Wow. That's aggressive. I would advise her to have a backup plan. Maybe get a CFA or
[00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:13.660]   something like that.
[00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:16.420]   Duncan asked about the Roth stuff potentially going on. I've heard that for years from people
[00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:20.540]   at WURT worried about that. So we had a surprise bill from the Democrats yesterday that included
[00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:24.980]   some tax provisions. Anything big or interesting to note in their bill?
[00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:28.780]   Yeah. So again, I think, Duncan, to answer your question before, this is what I was alluding
[00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:33.220]   to. The proposal, and it's just a proposal, we do have text that came out last night.
[00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:37.900]   You bet your bottom dollar, me and Bill Arts and our new hire, Tariq Silliman, were digging
[00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:40.780]   into that thing and chewing it up for breakfast.
[00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:44.220]   But it's more known that this bill, which it's a slimmed-down version of the Build Back
[00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:47.580]   Better bill. I think it's Build Back Biden, Build Back Better Back brought to you by the
[00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:52.780]   National Association of Chiropractors. This new bill is a very small version of it, and
[00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:56.460]   it's mostly what's not in the bill that's interesting. It does not extend SALT. It does
[00:27:56.460 --> 00:28:00.460]   not extend net investment income tax. It does not tax unrealized capital gains. It does
[00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:05.860]   not tax corporate buybacks, and it does not alter the Roth IRA framework, which is probably
[00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:08.060]   good for investors who want to use this.
[00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:14.220]   A couple of neat goodies. It does extend Obamacare ACA subsidies for another couple of years.
[00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:17.300]   Taxpayers are probably looking at a 10 percent increase instead of a 30 or 40 percent increase,
[00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:21.800]   so that's great for the 14 million Americans who are participating there.
[00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:27.060]   Interesting thing, electric vehicle extension credits, but these new ones are income-limited,
[00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:31.940]   and that's interesting. Energy credits for your house, a couple of goodies here, but
[00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:37.540]   a lot of the more pernicious changes happen on the corporate side, which is probably not
[00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:41.140]   the purview of your average portfolio rescue listener.
[00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:43.140]   Nothing huge as far as taxes go for individuals.
[00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:48.700]   No, and I think compared to the Secure Act of 2019 compared to TCGA in 2017, I wouldn't
[00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:52.900]   say it's a snoozer, but not a lot of headlines here if you're not planning on buying an electric
[00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:53.900]   vehicle.
[00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:57.220]   No help for homeowners on the coasts, right, for the SALT tax?
[00:28:57.220 --> 00:29:01.620]   Yeah, and Joe Manchin very much against private island trade that's coming out of pocket for
[00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:02.620]   the Carlson family.
[00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:05.260]   Hey, I live in a flyover state where housing is actually affordable.
[00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:10.700]   Midwest bias, again, Midwest bias, just raining down on us.
[00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:11.700]   Sounds like a dream.
[00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:18.180]   All right. Reminder, remember, again, next week, no show. Duncan's going to be Abbey
[00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:19.180]   Road.
[00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:20.180]   No nothing except for Animal Spirits next week, right?
[00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:22.740]   Animal Spirits will be the only thing. We'll be carrying the compound next week. Duncan's
[00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:24.860]   going to be gone. I'm going to be gone.
[00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:30.020]   Private Island tweets and tweets of Duncan swinging from Big Ben. Is it still 1,000 degrees
[00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:31.020]   in the UK right now?
[00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:32.020]   I think it is. Yeah.
[00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:33.020]   Wow.
[00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:37.060]   Good luck with that. Duncan, have fun spending some money over there. If you're listening
[00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:42.200]   in podcast form, give us a review on YouTube. Leave us a comment. Leave us a question. Maybe

[00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:55.580]   mug. Still never had a cup in my life. It's not changing. Keep those comments and questions
[00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:56.580]   coming.
[00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:57.580]   We're going to change that one day.
[00:29:57.580 --> 00:29:58.580]   We'll see you in--
[00:29:58.580 --> 00:29:59.900]   Maybe at Future Proof. Will you drink a cup of coffee at Future Proof maybe?
[00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:03.980]   Never. I've got to keep my ref up, Duncan. I can't say that anymore. At this point, I'm
[00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:04.980]   just--
[00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:07.500]   Yeah, that would be like me not pitching a Roth ARE conversion. It ain't happening.
[00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:10.220]   That's true. All right. Thanks, everyone. We'll see you in a couple of weeks.
[00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:27.860]   See you, everyone.
[00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:29.920]   you
