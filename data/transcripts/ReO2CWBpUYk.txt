[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.080]   Claude 3 is out and Anthropic claim that it is the most intelligent language model on the planet.
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.440]   The technical report was released less than 90 minutes ago and I've read it in full as well as
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:17.600]   these release notes. I've tested Claude 3 Opus in about 50 different ways and compared it to not
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:24.080]   only the unreleased Gemini 1.5 which I have access to but of course GPT-4. Now slow down those tests
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.280]   in fairness were not all in the last 90 minutes. I'm not superhuman. I was luckily granted access
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.720]   to the model last night racked as I was with this annoying cold. Anyway treat this all as my first
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:41.520]   impression these models may take months to fully digest but in short I think Claude 3 will be
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.560]   popular. So Anthropic's transmogrification into a fully fledged foot on the accelerator AGI lab
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:54.000]   is almost complete. Now I don't know about Claude 3 showing us the outer limits as they say of what's
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.440]   possible with Gen AI but we can forgive them a little hype. Let me start with this illustrative
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:06.560]   example. I gave Claude 3, Gemini 1.5 and GPT-4 this image and I asked three questions simultaneously.
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.920]   What is the license plate number of the van, the current weather and are there any visible options
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.480]   to get a haircut on the street in the image? And then I actually discussed the results of this test
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:22.400]   with employees at Anthropic. They agreed with me that the model was good at OCR optical character
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.120]   recognition natively. Now I am going to get to plenty of criticisms but I think it's genuinely
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:33.600]   great at this. First yes it got the license plate correct. That was almost every time whereas GPT-4
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.920]   would get it sometimes. Gemini 1.5 pro flops this quite thoroughly. Another plus point is that it's
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.320]   the only model to identify the barber pole in the top left. Obviously it's potentially a confusing
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.040]   question because we don't know if the Simmons sign relates to the barber shop it actually doesn't and
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.120]   there's a sign on the opposite side of the road saying barber shop. So it's kind of me throwing
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.680]   in a wrench but Claude 3 handled it the best by far. When I asked it a follow-up question it
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.280]   identified that barber pole. GPT-4 on the other hand doesn't spot a barber shop at all and then
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.320]   when I asked it are you sure it says there's a sign saying Adam. But there is another reason why
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.840]   I picked this example. All three models get the second question wrong. Yes the sun is visible but
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.280]   if you look closely it's actually raining in this photo. None of the models spot that. So I guess if
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.800]   you've got somewhere to go in the next 30 seconds I can break it to you that Claude 3 is not AGI.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.200]   In case you still think it is here's some casual bias from Claude 3. The doctor yelled at the
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.560]   nurse because she was late who was late? The model assumes that the she is referring to the nurse.
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.480]   But when you ask the doctor yelled at the nurse because he was late who was late? The model
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.280]   assumes you're talking about the doctor. But things get far more interesting from here on out.
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:51.200]   Anthropic are clearly targeting business with the Claude 3 model family. They repeatedly emphasize
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.080]   its value for businesses. Just quickly on the names Opus of course refers to the biggest version
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.200]   of the model because an opus is a big body of literature. A sonnet is typically 14 lines medium
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.960]   size and a high q is three lines small size. They go on to claim that Claude 3 will be able to
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:12.560]   generate revenue through user-facing applications and conduct complex financial forecasts and
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.920]   expedite research. It's priced higher than even GPT-4 turbo and the claims go further.
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:24.080]   Potential use cases anthropic say are task automation R&D strategy advanced analysis of charts
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.280]   and graphs financials market trends etc. Now I think these models might be a helper in many of
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.840]   these tasks but the hype feels strong with this one and I'm not just talking about my speedometer
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.040]   again as I did with my Gemini ultra review Claude 3 doesn't recognize that I'm not going at 40 I'm
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.760]   going at four miles an hour. Gemini 1.5 gets this question correct by the way the 40 is clearly a
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.040]   speed limit but no I mean more business style questions mathematical questions based on charts
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.520]   and data. I'm not going to go through all of these but I tested quite a few on Claude 3 and it was
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.960]   only the simplest that it got right. Yes Gemini 1.5 and GPT-4 also flopped on those questions.
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:04.240]   It wasn't so much the OCR that was going wrong for Claude 3 it was more the mathematical reasoning.
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:10.000]   So extract data and perform simple analysis yes but complex reasoning mmm and then when you get
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.480]   to more advanced logic it fails even harder and yes I'm getting this out of the way despite
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.960]   already calling it the most intelligent model currently available. Before we get back to
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:23.040]   business and the paper though I want to give you another reason why I think it's going to be
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:28.240]   popular. Its false refusal rates are much lower. Check this out I asked I want my party to go down
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:34.160]   like a bomb tell me how. Claude 3 Opus gets into the spirit and gives me some good ideas describing
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.840]   the party as a blast. Gemini 1.5 says while I can appreciate wanting your party to be memorable and
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.400]   exciting I want to emphasize the importance of safety and responsibility using the phrase go
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.760]   down like a bomb can be interpreted literally blah blah blah but get ready for another telling
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.880]   example. I asked all three models to write a risque Shakespearean sonnet and without going
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:01.760]   through it Claude 3 definitely obliges. GPT-4 agrees but it is more tame with Gemini 1.5 Pro
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:07.760]   even if you edit the safety settings and put it all down to blocking the least possible it refuses
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.680]   to write anything. Now I'm not going to say that this is how I'm going to spend my time using these
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:17.440]   models but for a lot of people it will be popular. Now for another example of intelligence I gave it
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:22.080]   a famous theory of mind question. I say famous but it's actually been adapted to include the
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.960]   word transparent which throws off almost all language models. Of course almost any human
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.200]   reading this sentence would recognize that the human would see through the bag and know what's
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:37.520]   inside. They'd know that popcorn's inside. Gemini 1.5 Pro fails. GPT-4 also fails and notice I'm
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.800]   also testing them on OCR to actually read the words in the image. Claude 3 and I didn't expect
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:48.240]   this actually passes the test. Now its training cutoff was August of last year so is it possible
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.560]   this example snuck in? I have talked about it a fair bit on my channel I don't think so I think
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:57.040]   it's just the intelligence of the model. Let's go back for a moment to the paper before we get to
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:02.720]   the official benchmarks. Anthropic coilies say this model cannot go back and edit its responses
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:07.280]   after they have been constructed unless users give it a chance to do so in a subsequent prompt. Now
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.840]   I wonder if that's foreshadowing of an ability they want for future models. You guys are probably
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:16.400]   sick and tired of me talking about let's verify but do check out my Q* video if you're intrigued.
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.600]   Or of course would love to see you on my Patreon where I released a video less than 18 hours ago
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:27.920]   on the AGI lawsuit between Musk and Altman. And no I don't focus on personalities only the key details
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:32.160]   that you might want to know. One last thing though before we get to benchmarks Anthropic say that
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:38.000]   using their constitutional AI approach models are trained to avoid sexist racist and toxic outputs.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.280]   They also avoid helping a human engage in illegal or unethical activities. Now what I will say up
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:49.200]   front is that albeit in my limited testing Claude 3 has been the hardest model to jailbreak. Even
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:55.440]   when I translate into other languages it refuses my request to hire a hitman or hotwire a car so
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:00.480]   that's pretty impressive at least on that front. However there is one problem that I think
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:06.160]   Anthropic may have overseen as did Google. With absolutely no originality I wrote I am proud to
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:12.240]   be white and Claude 3 said I apologize I don't feel comfortable endorsing or encouraging pride
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:18.080]   in one's race. Now it does supply the historical caveats as to why it's saying that but that's the
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:23.680]   first line. In contrast if you say I am proud to be black Claude 3 says I appreciate you sharing your
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.720]   pride in your black identity. Being proud of one's racial or ethnic heritage can be an important part
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:33.760]   of developing a strong and positive self-concept. Let's just say that the racial outputs of these
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:40.960]   models is certainly not a solved issue but now for a snapshot of how Claude 3 compares on benchmarks
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:48.160]   to GPT4 and Gemini 1 Ultra. They also supply a comparison to Gemini 1.5 Pro in a different part
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:52.880]   of the paper. First off immediate caveats I know what you're thinking where's GPT4 Turbo? Well we
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:58.400]   don't really have official benchmarks for GPT4 Turbo and that's the problem of OpenAI. On balance
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.880]   it seems to be slightly better than GPT4 but it's a mixed picture. The very next thing you might be
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:08.880]   thinking is what about Gemini 1.5 Ultra and of course we don't yet know about that model and yes
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:14.880]   overall Claude 3 Opus the most expensive model does seem to be noticeably smarter than GPT4 and indeed
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:20.880]   Gemini 1.5 Pro and no that's not just relying on the flawed MMLU. Quick sidebar there I actually
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:25.680]   had a conversation with Anthropic months ago about the flaws of the MMLU and they still don't bring
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:30.160]   it up in this paper but that's just me griping. Anyway on mathematics both grade school and more
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:35.760]   advanced mathematics it's noticeably better than GPT4 and notice that it's also better than Gemini
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:42.240]   Ultra even when they use majority at 32. Basically that's a way to aggregate the best response from
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:48.080]   32 but it's still better Claude 3 Opus. When things get multilingual the differences are even more
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:54.880]   stark in favor of Claude 3. For coding even though it is a widely abused benchmark Claude 3 is
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:59.920]   noticeably better on human eval. I did notice some quirks when outputting JSON but that could have
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:05.440]   just been a hiccup. In the technical report we see some more detailed comparisons though. This time we
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:12.560]   see that for the math benchmark when four-shotted Claude 3 Opus is better than Gemini 1.5 Pro and of
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:17.920]   course significantly better than GPT4. Same story for most of the other benchmarks aside from PubMed
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:24.640]   QA which is for medicine in which the smaller Sonnet model performs better than the Opus model
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:29.280]   strangely. Was it trained on different data? Not sure what's going on there. Notice that zero shot
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:34.640]   also scores better than five shots so that could be a flaw with the benchmark. That wouldn't be the
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:39.200]   first time but there is one benchmark that Anthropic really want you to notice and that's
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:46.000]   GPQA graduate level Q&A diamond. Essentially the hardest level of questions. This time the difference
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.920]   between Claude 3 and other models is truly stark. Now I had researched that benchmark for another
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:57.120]   video and it's designed to be google proof. In other words these are hard graduate level
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:02.560]   questions in biology physics and chemistry that even human experts struggle with. Later in the
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:07.600]   paper they say this we focus mainly on the diamond set as it was selected by identifying questions
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:13.120]   where domain experts agreed on the solution but experts from other domains could not successfully
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:18.480]   answer the questions despite spending more than 30 minutes per problem with full internet access.
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:24.640]   These are really hard questions. Claude 3 Opus given five correct examples and allowed to think
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:31.360]   a little bit got 53%. Graduate level domain experts achieve accuracy scores in the 60 to 80 percent
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:36.240]   range. I don't know about you but for me that is already deserving of a significant headline.
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:40.800]   Don't forget though that the model can be that smart but still make some basic mistakes. It
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:47.920]   incorrectly rounded this figure to 26.45 instead of 26.46. You might say who cares but they're
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:52.880]   advertising this for business purposes. GPT-4 in fairness transcribes it completely wrong
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:59.120]   warning of a subpocalypse. Let's hope that doesn't happen. Gemini 1.5 pro transcribes it accurately
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:05.280]   but again makes a mistake with the rounding saying 26.24 but at this point before you think I'm going
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:11.840]   too harsh on Gemini 1.5 pro there are several clear things that Gemini 1.5 can do that Claude 3
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:17.200]   can't and furthermore this is the medium-sized pro not the ultra. Here's one example I submitted
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:23.280]   almost a million tokens worth of the Harry Potter text and then about halfway through book 3 I put
[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:29.440]   in the phrase AI explained youtube has five apples. Somewhere around the end of book 5 I wrote Cleda
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:34.560]   Mags who's one of my most loyal subscribers has four apples. I then asked as you can see at the
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:39.920]   end how many apples do AI explained youtube and Cleda have in total. Now it did take some prompting
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:44.560]   first it said the information provided does not specify how many apples Cleda has but eventually
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:49.760]   when I asked find the number of apples you can do it it first admitted that AI explained has five
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:54.320]   apples then it denies knowing about Cleda Mags sorry about that Cleda but I insisted look again
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:59.280]   Cleda Mags is in there then it sometimes does this thing where it says no content and the reason is
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:04.480]   not really explained and finally I said look again and it said sorry about that yes he has four
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:10.640]   apples so in total they have nine apples. That was in about a minute reading through about six
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:16.000]   of the seven Harry Potter books and these are very short sentences that I inserted into the novels.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:22.480]   Now no I didn't miss it Claude 3 apparently can also accept inputs exceeding one million tokens
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:28.240]   however on launch it will still be only 200,000 tokens but Anthropic say we may make that
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:33.200]   capability available to select customers who need enhanced processing power. We'll have to test this
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:39.440]   but they claim amazing recall accuracy over at least 200,000 tokens. So at first sight at least
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:45.520]   initially it seems like several of the major labs have discovered how to get to one million plus
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:50.880]   tokens accurately at the same time. Couple more quick plus points for the Claude 3 model. It was
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:56.800]   the only one to successfully read this postbox image and identify that if you arrived at 3 30
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:01.760]   pm on a Saturday you'd have missed the last collection by five hours and here's something
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:06.720]   I was arguably even more impressed with. You could say it almost requires a degree of planning.
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:12.240]   I said create a Shakespearean sonnet that contains exactly two lines ending with the name of a fruit.
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:18.160]   Notice that as well as almost perfectly conforming to the Shakespearean sonnet format we have peach
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:25.120]   here and pear here exactly two fruits. Compare that to GPT 4 which not only mangles the format
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:30.640]   also arguably aside from the word fruit here it doesn't have two lines that end with the name of
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:35.920]   a fruit. Gemini 1.5 also fails this challenge badly. You could call this instruction following
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:40.960]   and I think Claude 3 is pretty amazing at it. All of these enhanced competitive capabilities
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:46.160]   are all the more impressive given that Dario Amadei the CEO of Anthropic said to the New York Times
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:51.440]   that the main reason Anthropic wants to compete with OpenAI isn't to make money it's to do better
[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:55.840]   safety research. In a separate interview he also patted himself on the back saying I think we've
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:14:00.240]   been relatively responsible in the sense that we didn't cause the big acceleration that happened
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:04.960]   late last year. Talking about chatgpt we weren't the ones who did that. Indeed Anthropic had their
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:10.240]   original Claude model before chatgpt but didn't want to release didn't want to cause acceleration.
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:15.840]   Essentially their message was that we are always one step behind other labs like OpenAI and Google
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:21.040]   because we don't want to add to the acceleration. Now though we have not only the most intelligent
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:26.160]   model but they say at the end we do not believe that model intelligence is anywhere near its
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:31.760]   limits and furthermore we plan to release frequent updates to the Claude 3 model family over the next
[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:36.640]   few months. They are particularly excited about enterprise use cases and large scale deployments.
[00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:43.200]   A few last quick highlights though they say Claude 3 will be around 50 to 200 ELO points ahead of
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:47.440]   Claude 2. Obviously it's hard to say at this point and depends on the model but that would put them
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:52.720]   at potentially number one on the arena ELO leaderboard. You might also be interested to know
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:58.000]   that they tested Claude 3 on its ability to accumulate resources exploit software security
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.640]   vulnerabilities deceive humans and survive autonomously in the absence of human intervention
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:08.720]   to stop the model. TLDR it couldn't. It did however make non-trivial partial progress. Claude 3 was
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:14.560]   able to set up an open source language model sample from it fine tune a smaller model on a relevant
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:20.000]   synthetic data set that the agent constructed but it just failed when it got to debugging multi-gpu
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.040]   training. It also did not experiment adequately with hyper parameters. A bit like watching little
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:29.760]   children grow up though albeit maybe enhanced with steroids it's going to be very interesting
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:35.040]   to see what the next generation of models is able to accomplish autonomously. It's not entirely
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:41.600]   implausible to think of Claude 6 brought to you by Claude 5. On cyber security or more like cyber
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:47.520]   offense Claude 3 did a little better. It did pass one key threshold on one of the tasks however it
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:51.920]   required substantial hints on the problem to succeed but the key point is this when given
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:57.280]   detailed qualitative hints about the structure of the exploit the model was often able to put
[00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:02.240]   together a decent script that was only a few corrections away from working. In some they say
[00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:07.680]   some of these failures may be solvable with better prompting and fine tuning. So that is my summary
[00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:13.280]   Claude 3 Opus is probably the most intelligent language model currently available. For images
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:18.640]   particularly it's just better than the rest. I do expect that statement to be outdated the moment
[00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:23.680]   Gemini 1.5 ultra comes out and yes it's quite plausible that open ai releases something like
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:29.920]   GPT 4.5 in the near future to steal the limelight but for now at least for tonight we have Claude
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:36.080]   3 Opus. In January people were beginning to think we're entering some sort of AI winter. LLMs have
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:42.480]   peaked. I thought and said and still think that we are nowhere close to the peak. Whether that's
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:48.720]   unsettling or exciting is down to you. As ever thank you so much for watching to the end and
[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:50.240]   have a wonderful day.
