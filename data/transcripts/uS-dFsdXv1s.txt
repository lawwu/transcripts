[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.720]   Well, how do we prepare for the second coming of Christ?
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:08.960]   The question is a great one.
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.420]   It's always relevant, and it comes to us today from a listener to the podcast named Sarah.
[00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.240]   Thank you for this podcast, Pastor John.
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.080]   She writes, "How do I prepare for the second coming of Christ properly?
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.360]   What can I expect?
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.360]   What is to come?
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.260]   What should I be doing now as I eagerly await his return?"
[00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:33.200]   One way to summarize our preparation for the second coming is to say that there are three
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.640]   impulses that help us be ready.
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:42.520]   One, the impulse that comes from the glorious prospect of seeing the Lord.
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:49.120]   Two, the impulse that comes from the necessity of suffering before he comes.
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:57.900]   Three, the impulse to be found faithful and vigilant in our particular callings when he comes.
[00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:03.840]   So let me illustrate each of those three impulses, because that's the answer to the question,
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.220]   how do you prepare?
[00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.220]   You prepare by responding biblically to those three impulses.
[00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.700]   First, the impulse that comes from the glorious prospect of seeing the Lord.
[00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.140]   First John 3, 2 and 3.
[00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.020]   "Beloved, we are God's children now.
[00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.880]   What we will be has not yet appeared, but we know that when he appears," that's the
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.860]   second coming, "when he appears, we shall be like him, because we shall see him as he
[00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.280]   is.
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:45.980]   And everyone who thus hopes in him purifies himself now as he is pure."
[00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.280]   So think about the psychological dynamics of those verses.
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:57.440]   When he says, "Everyone who thus hopes in him," he's referring to hoping to be like
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.440]   him.
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.880]   "When he appears, we shall be like him."
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:09.700]   Whoever thus, hoping to be like him, thus hopes in him, will purify himself now.
[00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:17.640]   So the point is, if you really want to be like him by seeing him when he comes, you'll
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.800]   pursue being like him now.
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.220]   You will.
[00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:28.700]   So the impulse of becoming a radically pure, holy, loving, sacrificial, Christ-like person
[00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:37.240]   now is the intense hope and desire for that to happen when he comes and we see him.
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.880]   That's the first impulse.
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:45.680]   Second, the impulse that comes from the necessity of suffering before Jesus comes.
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.920]   Now I have in mind here all Christian suffering, because Paul said that through many tribulations
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.440]   we must all enter the kingdom of God, Acts 14.22.
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:03.520]   And I have in mind the suffering that will become more intense near the end when Paul
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:12.920]   says in 2 Thessalonians 2.8, "The lawless one will be revealed in the earth, whom the
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:21.040]   Lord Jesus will kill with the breath of his mouth and bring to nothing by the appearance
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.040]   of his coming."
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:29.180]   Now, Jesus speaks of that season of lawlessness in Matthew 24.11-13.
[00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.600]   Many false prophets will arise and lead many astray.
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:40.180]   And because lawlessness is increased, the love of many will grow cold, but the one who
[00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.260]   endures to the end will be saved.
[00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:49.780]   So the implication is that we should get ready for the Lord's coming, one, by being spiritually
[00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.900]   and mentally alert to satanic deception and false teaching.
[00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.500]   Two, we should be completely submitted to the Word of God rather than being lawless
[00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.500]   or self-willed.
[00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:08.460]   Three, we should be cultivating strong faith in the sovereign goodness of God so that we
[00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:15.580]   can endure to the end through whatever suffering comes our way.
[00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:21.860]   And just a word about how this applies to today, perhaps more than any other time in
[00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:22.860]   history.
[00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.260]   I may be wrong about that, but that's my guess.
[00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:34.140]   Human beings have developed popular as well as intellectual and sophisticated ways of
[00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:39.840]   denying the existence of any divine law or standard.
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:46.900]   We have found a way to claim plausibility for creating our own truth, creating our own
[00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.340]   right and wrong, creating our own identity.
[00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:57.040]   If you are born a man and you want, you want to be a woman, then there is no law in God,
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.300]   no law in nature, no law in culture to hinder you.
[00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.300]   You do whatever you think you want to do.
[00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.140]   You are a law to yourself.
[00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:14.740]   That's what Jesus means by lawlessness, and it is multiplied and increased.
[00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:20.700]   And Jesus says such lawlessness will be multiplied, will be increased, and that the effect is
[00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:26.460]   a tragic coldness of love among Christians.
[00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:32.120]   So one way to prepare for the second coming and its antecedent sufferings is to submit
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:41.220]   ourselves with intelligence and wisdom and joy to the absolute standards of God's law
[00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:46.140]   for the sake of warm love, not cold love.
[00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:52.820]   Number three, the third impulse to be ready for the second coming is the impulse to be
[00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:59.140]   found faithful and vigilant in our particular callings.
[00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:04.860]   Over and over and over in the New Testament, we are told to be watchful, to be awake, to
[00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:05.860]   be ready.
[00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.700]   What does that mean?
[00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:13.500]   I think the parable of the ten virgins is a good illustration of what it means.
[00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.940]   The kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went to meet the
[00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:18.940]   bridegroom.
[00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:23.660]   So that's a picture of being ready for the second coming, the bride returning.
[00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.940]   Five of them were foolish, five were wise.
[00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:32.540]   When the foolish took their lamps, they took no oil with them, but the wise took flasks
[00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.420]   of oil with their lamps.
[00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:40.580]   As the bridegroom was delayed, and that's Jesus' hint that there's going to be some
[00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:47.300]   distance of time, they all became drowsy and slept.
[00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:51.980]   All of them slept, all ten, not just five, all five, all ten slept.
[00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:56.600]   But at midnight, there was a cry, "Here's the bridegroom, come out to meet him."
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.900]   Then all the virgins rose, trimmed their lamps.
[00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:03.340]   The foolish said to the wise, "Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out."
[00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:08.900]   But the wise answered, saying, "Since there will not be enough for us and for you, go
[00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.700]   rather to the dealers and buy for yourselves."
[00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:19.820]   And while they were going to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready, ready, went
[00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:24.780]   in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut.
[00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:29.100]   Afterward, the other virgins also came, saying, "Lord, Lord, open to us."
[00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:34.060]   But he said, "Truly, truly, I say to you, I do not know you."
[00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:39.140]   And here's Jesus' conclusion, "Watch, therefore."
[00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:44.580]   So the conclusion of the whole parable is answering this question, how do you get ready?
[00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:47.940]   Watch, therefore, for you know neither the day or the hour.
[00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:49.820]   Now what does that mean?
[00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:50.820]   Watch?
[00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:55.700]   Both the wise and the foolish virgins were asleep, and there was no criticism.
[00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:56.980]   That's not a problem.
[00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:03.180]   To watch, therefore, doesn't mean any kind of artificial getting up at night, looking
[00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:09.540]   out the window, paying a lot of attention to end-time conspiracy theories.
[00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:15.500]   Watch means do your job really well for Christ's sake.
[00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:17.780]   They had an assignment.
[00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:19.660]   Have your lamps.
[00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:21.940]   Have your oil.
[00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:24.220]   Respond to the announcement when it's given.
[00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:29.620]   Take the way of the bridegroom in, and they did their job just the way they should, and
[00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:31.700]   they entered in.
[00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:37.100]   They were morally, spiritually, you might say, professionally awake.
[00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:41.580]   They did their job the way God meant for them to do it.
[00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:44.220]   So that's what you find all over the New Testament.
[00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:49.420]   The Master has given all of us assignments for while he's gone.
[00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:55.780]   Gifts, resources, abilities, money, opportunities, relationships, spiritual disciplines, all
[00:08:55.780 --> 00:09:02.540]   of those are spheres where we do our job with faithfulness and diligence.
[00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:06.580]   One of the most important texts for me over the years as a pastor, and even still, is
[00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:13.180]   Luke 12, 42, where he says, like I'm hearing this spoken right to me, John Piper, "Who
[00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:20.740]   then," John Piper, "is the faithful and wise manager, whom his master will set over
[00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:26.620]   his household to give them their portion of food at the proper time.
[00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:34.820]   Blessed is that servant whom his master will find so doing when he comes.
[00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:39.400]   Truly I say to you, he will set him over all his possessions."
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.460]   You know what that means for me?
[00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:50.420]   That means, Piper, work your faithful fanny off to speak truth on Ask Pastor John.
[00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:56.580]   And if the Lord comes and finds you getting ready the day before you record, you'll
[00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:58.780]   be glad you were at work.
[00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:00.660]   Yes, I will.
[00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:08.500]   So let your life be guided by, one, the impulse that comes from the prospect of seeing the
[00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:14.340]   Lord, two, the impulse that comes from the necessity of suffering, three, the impulse
[00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:21.180]   to be found faithful, vigilant, full of love to Christ in our particular callings.
[00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:26.060]   And then we will hear him say, "Enter into the joy of your master."
[00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:27.060]   Wonderful.
[00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:28.060]   Thank you, Pastor John.
