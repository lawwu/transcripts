[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.560]   - Welcome back to the Ask Pastor John podcast
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.920]   and we begin the week with a question from Tyson.
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.920]   Hello Pastor John, we met a couple of months back
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.960]   at a conference in Dallas, very happy to have met you.
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.900]   My question, we know that God is sovereign.
[00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.840]   How does God use his sovereignty for the greater good
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.880]   when our free will is in place?
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.560]   In other words, will God use his sovereignty
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.840]   to overwrite our free will at times
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.320]   to exemplify his perfect will?
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.480]   And if so, how do we truly have free will?
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.600]   Pastor John, how would you explain this to Tyson?
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.960]   - I'm not sure what Tyson means by free will.
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.760]   And so I may not be able to answer the question
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.680]   if he means something by free will that I don't believe in.
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.680]   So let's try out a definition
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.040]   and let the scripture shed light on this problem.
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.640]   I think Tyson will get the answer he's after
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.320]   at least the best I can give it.
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.520]   The technical definition of free will
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.280]   that creates the controversies with those like me
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.320]   who believe in the sovereignty of God over the human will,
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.320]   not just a general statement about the sovereignty of God,
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.920]   but God's sovereignty over the human will,
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.280]   that definition is this.
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.040]   Man's will is free
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.880]   if he has the power of ultimate self-determination.
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.320]   And what I mean by ultimate self-determination
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.240]   is that no power outside of man himself
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.120]   has ultimate or decisive control over what a man chooses,
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.720]   at least not when he's acting as a moral agent
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.840]   who must give an account to God.
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.840]   Neither other people, nor influences, nor God himself
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.600]   has decisive control over a person's choices.
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.880]   God and man and nature may have some influence,
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.240]   but this influence cannot be decisive.
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.400]   They may have a kind of causality,
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.040]   but not ultimate causality or decisive causality.
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.160]   Otherwise, the man would not be free on this definition
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.080]   that I'm unfolding.
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.080]   So Wesleyans and Arminians are insistent
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.200]   that for a person to believe on Christ and be saved,
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.160]   divine influence is indeed necessary.
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.080]   They call it prevenient grace,
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.840]   grace that has come before our faith
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.840]   and thus influences us toward Christ.
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.360]   But this influence on the Wesleyan and Arminian understanding,
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.760]   this influence cannot be decisive.
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.000]   The final and decisive and ultimate cause
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.360]   of our believing Christ is not the Holy Spirit.
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.680]   It is not divine grace.
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.080]   It is our own input.
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.880]   God may get the process of conversion started,
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.720]   but the decisive influence is provided by ourselves.
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.280]   This is what is meant by free will on this definition.
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.160]   It is ultimate or decisive self-determination.
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.900]   Now, if that's what Tyson means in his question,
[00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.800]   I can't answer his question
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.640]   because I don't think such a thing exists
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.640]   anywhere in the universe except in the will of God.
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.920]   Only God has free will
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.920]   in the sense of ultimate self-determination.
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.080]   And here are a few of the reasons why I think that,
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:04.080]   'cause I don't know whether Tyson agrees with that or not.
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.440]   Jesus talked about why Judas did not believe on him.
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.040]   John 6, 64, it says,
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.560]   "Jesus knew from the beginning
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.320]   "who those were who did not believe
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.120]   "and who it was who would betray him.
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.360]   "And he said, 'This is why I told you
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.280]   "'that no one can come to me
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.920]   "'unless it is granted him by the Father.'"
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.220]   In other words, no one can come to Jesus.
[00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:39.160]   That is, no one can believe unless God grants him the faith.
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.160]   Judas did not come to Jesus decisively, fully, savingly
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:49.360]   because it was not granted to him, Jesus says, by the Father.
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:55.000]   And Jesus takes the truth and generalizes it to all of us
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.160]   and says in this very verse,
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:02.160]   "No one," not just Judas, "No one can come to me
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.680]   "unless it is granted,
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.680]   "unless the decisive coming is granted by the Father."
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.820]   No one has the power of ultimate self-determination
[00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.780]   to get themselves to God.
[00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.680]   God gives or withholds the power to come.
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.680]   Nudges to come will not save anybody.
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.620]   What is given by God is the coming.
[00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:33.340]   Another reason I don't think ultimate self-determination
[00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.260]   exists in human beings is 2 Timothy 2:24,
[00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.320]   where Paul says, "The Lord's servant should correct
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.280]   "his opponents with gentleness.
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:48.280]   "God may perhaps grant that they will repent
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:53.080]   "and come to know the truth."
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.200]   So repentance is the flip side of the coin of faith
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.720]   with faith on the other side of the coin
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.080]   and faith embraces Christ.
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.680]   Repentance turns from embracing others.
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.920]   False reliance is so the gift of repentance
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.900]   is the gift of the coin.
[00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.940]   It's the gift of rejecting self-reliance
[00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:13.980]   and embracing Christ.
[00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:15.740]   It is the gift of salvation.
[00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:20.740]   And without the gift of God to cause us to repent
[00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:25.780]   and believe, none of us would be saved.
[00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:30.900]   Another reason is that John says in John 5, 1,
[00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:35.900]   1 John 5, 1, the epistle, "Everyone who believes
[00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:40.900]   "that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God."
[00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:46.060]   Self-willed faith does not bring about the new birth,
[00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:47.020]   just the opposite.
[00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:49.560]   The new birth brings about faith.
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:54.180]   Faith is therefore not the result of human self-determination
[00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.020]   but of new birth.
[00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:59.680]   One more reason among many, many more.
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:04.680]   Proverbs 21, 1, "The king's heart is a stream of water
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.220]   "in the hand of the Lord.
[00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:08.700]   "He turns it wherever he will."
[00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:11.500]   No king anywhere on earth has the power
[00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:14.200]   of ultimate self-determination.
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:18.980]   So I don't think such a thing exists except in God.
[00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.780]   God is ultimately self-determining
[00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:26.140]   but man is not ultimately and decisively self-determining.
[00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:29.720]   Nevertheless, and I think this gets at what Tyson
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:34.300]   is asking about, nevertheless, we are responsible,
[00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:38.420]   accountable for our preferences and our choices.
[00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:41.640]   If God is sovereign over the human will,
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:42.900]   are we responsible?
[00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:47.900]   Yes, we are, and the Bible says so over and over again.
[00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:51.640]   Our choices are our choices.
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.540]   They are true choices.
[00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:54.580]   We have a will.
[00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:56.020]   Our will is active.
[00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:58.500]   We are genuine moral agents.
[00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.260]   We will, as Jesus says, give an account
[00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.600]   for every careless word, Matthew 12, 36.
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:08.860]   Indeed, all of our preferences and choices and behavior,
[00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:12.060]   according to Romans 14, 12, we'll give an account of.
[00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:16.420]   Each of us will give an account of himself to God.
[00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:20.540]   Human beings do not have ultimate self-determination
[00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:24.340]   and we will all give an account to God
[00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:26.660]   for our preferences and our choices.
[00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:31.200]   So instead of speaking of the will as free or not,
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:34.300]   I prefer to speak of people as free or not
[00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:36.420]   because that's the way the Bible does.
[00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:38.900]   For freedom, Christ has set us free.
[00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:42.340]   Paul says in Galatians 5, 1, Christians are free
[00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:47.180]   from the bondage to sin and from the oppressive demand
[00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:50.180]   of having to perform our own salvation.
[00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:51.940]   Maybe the best way to end would be
[00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:56.620]   to quote this great liberation from Romans 6, 17.
[00:08:56.620 --> 00:09:00.620]   Thanks be to God, that's so important,
[00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:02.620]   and that's the way we should live as believers,
[00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:04.060]   with a heart brimming like this.
[00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:09.060]   Thanks be to God that you who were once slaves of sin
[00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:13.900]   have become obedient from the heart
[00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:16.220]   to the standard of teaching to which you were committed
[00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:19.940]   and having been set free from sin,
[00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:24.940]   have become slaves of righteousness.
[00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:28.500]   Such a great liberation text to close with
[00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.780]   and those are all really key texts.
[00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:32.220]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:33.740]   Actually, you might wanna jot these down
[00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.860]   and study the passages later by yourself.
[00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:37.680]   It would be worth the time.
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.900]   The texts mentioned in this podcast, again,
[00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:44.700]   included John chapter six, verses 64 and 65,
[00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:48.140]   2 Timothy 2, verses 24 and 25,
[00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:53.140]   1 John 5, 1, Proverbs 21, 1, Matthew 12, 36,
[00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:57.260]   Romans 14, 12, Galatians 5, 1,
[00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:01.860]   and finally Romans chapter six, verses 17 and 18.
[00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:05.700]   Such important texts to read and study.
