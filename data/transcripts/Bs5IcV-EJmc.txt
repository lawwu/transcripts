[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   First off, why would you want to pay your taxes by credit card?
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.320]   Because it is not free.
[00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.180]   There are fees.
[00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.940]   And the way I think about it is there's really only one reason, and that's that you're getting
[00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:08.760]   a positive ROI.
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:15.180]   Now, those fees range from as low as 1.75% all the way up to around 3%.
[00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.900]   We'll talk about that a little more, which means you need to be using a credit card that
[00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.440]   earns more than that for it to make sense.
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:28.380]   And I would argue a lot more than that, or at least a decent amount more than that, unless
[00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.560]   you're just interested in buying points.
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.920]   Now, that might be a thing you are interested in.
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.640]   There's no easy way to buy transferable points from most of the different banks out there.
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.660]   So this could be an opportunity to buy some transferable points.
[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:49.460]   But I think the really interesting opportunity is when you can use this to earn more value
[00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:50.620]   than what you're paying.
[00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.100]   And that could even be a spread on cash back.
