[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.580]   Rueben's been a part of our class for, let's see, the entire semester.
[00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.800]   And Rueben, just as the class came in, made an announcement today, and we're going to
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.400]   let him make this particular announcement to everybody that's watching by way of DVD
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.400]   as well.
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.480]   So Rueben, come here and make an announcement.
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.300]   And I want you to keep in mind that this particular announcement is part of the fruit or the benefit
[00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.880]   of marriage and the family counseling class.
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:39.160]   I have to say that the one who made the announcement was my roommate.
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.160]   So now I've been forced to come here.
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.160]   But gladly, I would say that I'm proposing tonight to my girlfriend, obviously.
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.160]   And I would say, yeah, it's kind of a fruit for this class.
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.160]   And also, well, this class has made me think if I was ready to get married.
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.160]   And I realized that I was.
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.160]   So I'm going to make an announcement.
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.160]   And I'm going to make an announcement tonight.
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.160]   And I'm going to make an announcement.

[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.160]   And I'm going to make an announcement tonight.

[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.160]   And I'm going to make an announcement tonight.
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.160]   And I'm going to make an announcement tonight.

[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.160]   And I'm going to make an announcement tonight.
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.160]   And I'm going to make an announcement tonight.
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.160]   And I'm going to make an announcement tonight.
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.160]   And I'm going to make an announcement tonight.
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.160]   And I'm going to make an announcement tonight.
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.160]   And I'm going to make an announcement tonight.
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.160]   And I'm going to make an announcement tonight.
[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.160]   And I'm going to make an announcement tonight.
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.160]   And I'm going to make an announcement tonight.
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:02:02.160]   And I'm going to make an announcement tonight.
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.160]   And I'm going to make an announcement tonight.
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.160]   And I'm going to make an announcement tonight.
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.160]   And I'm going to make an announcement tonight.
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.160]   And I'm going to make an announcement tonight.
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.160]   And I'm going to make an announcement tonight.
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.160]   And I'm going to make an announcement tonight.
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.160]   And I'm going to make an announcement tonight.
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.160]   And I'm going to make an announcement tonight.
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.160]   And I'm going to make an announcement tonight.
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.160]   And I'm going to make an announcement tonight.
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.160]   And I'm going to make an announcement tonight.
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.160]   And I'm going to make an announcement tonight.
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.160]   And I'm going to make an announcement tonight.
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.160]   And I'm going to make an announcement tonight.
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.160]   And I'm going to make an announcement tonight.
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.160]   And I'm going to make an announcement tonight.
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.160]   And I'm going to make an announcement tonight.
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.160]   And I'm going to make an announcement tonight.
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:43.160]   And I'm going to make an announcement tonight.
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:50.160]   And the funny thing about this particular story is that if you've ever had children,
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.160]   and if you've ever had multiple children, you realize how true this is,
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.160]   how parents go through sort of an evolution.
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.160]   On their first child, they're a certain way.
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.160]   On their second child, they're a little bit different.
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.160]   On their third child, they're a little bit different.
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.160]   And this kind of explains the evolution in regards to several different topics.
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.160]   Well, the first one is clothing.
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.160]   On the first baby, it said you begin wearing maternity clothes
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.160]   as soon as your OB/GYN confirms your pregnancy.
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.160]   On the second baby, you wear your regular clothes as long as possible.
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:31.160]   On the third baby, your maternity clothes are your regular clothes.
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.160]   And what about the baby's name?
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.160]   You watch couples naming their babies.
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.160]   You pour over baby name books and practice pronouncing
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.160]   and writing combinations of all your favorites.
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.160]   On the second baby, well, someone has to name their kid after great Aunt Mavis,
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.160]   and it might as well be you.
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.160]   On the third baby, you open the name book, close your eyes,
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.160]   you see where your finger falls.
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.160]   Oh, Bimbaldo, that'll work, perfect.
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.160]   So by the third baby, you don't care.
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.160]   What about preparing for birth?
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.160]   On the first baby, you practice your breathing religiously.
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.160]   On the second baby, you don't bother practicing
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.160]   because you remember the last time the breathing didn't help a thing at all.
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:16.160]   On the third baby, you ask for an epidural in your eighth month.
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.160]   What about worries?
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.160]   On the first baby, at the first sign of distress,
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.160]   a little whimper, a little frown, you run in and you pick up the baby.
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.160]   On the second baby, you pick the baby up
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.160]   when her wails threaten to wake the firstborn.
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.160]   On the third baby, you teach your three-year-old
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.160]   how to rewind the mechanical swing.
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.160]   What about activities?
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.160]   Well, you take your infant to baby gymnastics, baby swing,
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.160]   baby story hour on the first baby.
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.160]   Second baby, you take your infant to baby gymnastics.
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.160]   Third baby, you take your infant to the supermarket and the dry cleaners.
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.160]   How about getting out?
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.160]   On the first baby, the first time you leave your baby with a sitter,
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.160]   you call home five times.
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.160]   On the second baby, just before you walk out the door,
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.160]   you remember to leave a number where you can be reached.
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.160]   On the third baby, you leave instructions for the sitter
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.160]   to call only if she sees blood.
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.160]   And what about being at home?
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.160]   On the first baby, you spend a good bit of every day just gazing at the baby.
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.160]   On the second baby, you spend a bit of every day
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.160]   watching to be sure the older child isn't squeezing, poking, or hitting the child.
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:28.160]   On the third baby, you spend a little bit of every day hiding from the children.
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:34.160]   That seems to be the evolution of what happens with parents in regards to children.
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.160]   Well, we want to talk about this, and especially we want to talk about this
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.160]   in relationship to parenting in the 21st century.
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:47.160]   And we've chosen to start off this way because I believe that children
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:55.160]   are facing unique experiences today that you and I did not face when we were their age.
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:00.160]   In fact, your children will face experiences at a much younger age
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.160]   and make decisions about those experiences that you did not have to face
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.160]   until you were much older.
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:11.160]   Most Christian young people today experience so much so young,
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:16.160]   and the habits and responses that they're learning
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.160]   and they're forming in reaction to those experiences
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.160]   end up staying with them for the rest of their lives.
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:30.160]   As parents, I think our most critical role is to help our children develop
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:35.160]   the intellectual capacity to make informed, biblical decisions
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.160]   that really honor the Lord with their lives.
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.160]   This is what Ecclesiastes 12, 1 talks about,
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:45.160]   where to remember our Creator in the days of our youth.
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:50.160]   Before the evil days come, and the evil days there is really a reference to growing old
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.160]   when things get really hard and difficult.
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:59.160]   Before evil days come, and it becomes more and more difficult
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:07.160]   to establish godly or biblical habits.
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:11.160]   What we're saying here is that Christian parenting, really in the 21st century,
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.160]   presents a whole new set of challenges.
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:20.160]   If you're going to pastor or you're going to counsel couples that have children
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.160]   that are facing a variety of different struggles,
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:29.160]   you've got to understand the broader context in which they are growing up.
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:34.160]   Even though you and I have been 7 years of age, or 11, or 13, or 17,
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:40.160]   there is a sense in which we have never been the age that our children are or will be.
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:45.160]   Because you and I have not faced some of the choices that they've had to face.
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:51.160]   So how do you counsel parents in an MTV generation with Xbox and iPods
[00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:57.160]   and instant messaging in the midst of rapidly changing societal customs,
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:01.160]   homosexuality, lesbianism, not only accepted but even praised,
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:04.160]   new designer drugs and specialty alcoholic drinks,
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:08.160]   and ever-changing cultural morality,
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:15.160]   that obviously has a huge impact upon the Christian family.
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:21.160]   Because even though they may be very devoted and very holy
[00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:28.160]   and committed to raising their children in a godly way,
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:32.160]   it's difficult. They realize it's a difficult challenge.
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:39.160]   In fact, grab your Bible just for a moment and I want you to go over to 2 Timothy 3.
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:43.160]   This is not unanticipated in Scripture.
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:50.160]   It's always amazing to me when Paul describes the last days.
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:53.160]   Of course, as a pre-millennialist,
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:59.160]   I'm very committed to the fact that this is a description of what the last days will be like.
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:06.160]   Verse 1, "But realize this, that in the last days difficult times will come."
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.160]   Literally, the Greek here is dangerous times.
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.160]   Times or seasons or epochs will come.
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:16.160]   And then he gives a description of why these were going to be difficult.
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:23.160]   And it says here, "Men will be," first thing on the list, "lovers of self."
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.160]   And by the way, I believe that that little phrase,
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:30.160]   because of the way the Semitic mind usually puts together groupings of things,
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.160]   actually characterizes everything else in this list.
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:37.160]   Men will be lovers of self, and so as a result of that, they'll be lovers of money.
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.160]   They love self, so they'll be boastful.
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.160]   They love self because, and they'll be arrogant.
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.160]   They'll love self, they'll be revilers.
[00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:49.160]   They love self, and they'll be disobedient to parents.
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:52.160]   And because they love self, they'll be ungrateful.
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:57.160]   They'll be unholy, they'll be unloving in relationship to others, irreconcilable.
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:00.160]   Malicious gossips, without self-control, brutal.
[00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:03.160]   Haters of good, treacherous, reckless, conceited.
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.160]   Lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God.
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:09.160]   Holding to a form of godliness, although they have denied its power.
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:12.160]   And then it says, "Avoid such men as these."
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:16.160]   So, this is not unanticipated in Scripture.
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:20.160]   The fact that we live in a very dangerous day and age.
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:27.160]   There's a sense in which the challenges, in terms of the specifics, have changed.
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:33.160]   But children have not, and the way that children respond to things have not changed.
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:42.160]   And so, as Christian pastors, as Christian counselors, it's imperative that we help people.
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:46.160]   That we minister the Word of God to view the Scriptures, not as one of the answers.
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:50.160]   But as the answer for rearing children in the 21st century.
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.160]   I think that's vital.
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.160]   This is not just one answer among many.
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:11:01.160]   This is the authoritative answer, based upon the fact that this is the sufficient, inerrant, authoritative Word of God.
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:05.160]   Inspired by God.
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.160]   It is the ultimate answer.
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:16.160]   Now, in order to deal with this particular issue, let's go back to the Old Testament.
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:28.160]   And we've got to go to a particular text that I think has caused a lot of problems in misunderstanding.
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.160]   In Christian parenting and rearing children.
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:35.160]   And we're interested in Proverbs 22, verse 6.
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:40.160]   Proverbs 22, verse 6.
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:44.160]   This verse, probably, is one of the most quoted verses in the Bible when it comes to child rearing.
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:49.160]   And the way that you understand, or use this verse in counseling,
[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:54.160]   has a huge effect on the way that people will really rear their children.
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:12:01.160]   If they're conscientious Christian people who love the Word of God, it will have a huge effect.
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:06.160]   And the question is, how do we understand this particular verse?
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.160]   Or, we could ask it like this.
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.160]   What does the verse mean?
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:18.160]   Does it guarantee that if I bring up my child in the right way, when he or she is older, they will not depart from it?
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:23.160]   Well, the New American Standard Version translates this.
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:34.160]   Train up a child in the way he should go, and even when he is old, he will not depart from it.
[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:37.160]   So, when we ask the question, what does this verse mean?
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:40.160]   This is really a huge question.
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:46.160]   Does it really guarantee that if I bring up my child and give them the right kind of environment,
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:55.160]   and the right kind of circumstances, and the right kind of education, that my child will grow up loving the Lord?
[00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:58.160]   That's certainly one way you can take it.
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:03.160]   Or, in the past probably 10 years, I've also heard a new twist on this verse where this has to do,
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:08.160]   and this is usually a psychological twist, has to do with personality.
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:14.160]   You bring up a child and you let him go according to his own personality.
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:20.160]   For example, if you have a child that has a great appreciation for aesthetics or music,
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:24.160]   then you let him go down the route where they become musical.
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:37.160]   Or, if they have a great ability in the area of athletics, then you let him follow that propensity towards athletics.
[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:40.160]   Does it have to do with the giftedness of a child?
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.160]   Does it have to do with the personality of a child?
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:46.160]   That's a good question too.
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:58.160]   But by far, probably the most common interpretation of this is that if you bring up a child,
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:04.160]   and in the right way, with the right kind of discipline, the right kind of environment,
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:10.160]   when they grow up, they will not depart from the right way.
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:17.160]   In other words, it would be viewed as a guarantee.
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:21.160]   And there are a lot of Christian parents who view this verse this way.
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:27.160]   They think if you're able to shield your child from society and only provide them with the right kind of Christian influences,
[00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:31.160]   then they will grow up as good, solid Christians.
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:39.160]   And so, the tendency then is to shield the child away from all the negative influences that are out there in the world
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:44.160]   and just bring them up in a totally, just purely Christian environment.
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.160]   Obviously, you understand the problem with that thinking.
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:52.160]   The assumption is that all the bad influences are out there.
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:56.160]   When in reality, if you really understand what the Bible says about a child,
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.160]   the bad influences really don't begin out there.
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:02.160]   The bad influences begin in their own heart.
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:11.160]   It begins with their own propensities, their own passions, their own desires that tend towards evil.
[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:18.160]   And if you just define the environment as being the cause for the way in which the children go wrong,
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:28.160]   sort of like Skinner, though a child's life is like a tabula rasa, it's just a blank slate,
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:38.160]   and negative marks on that particular slate cause that child to grow up in a negative fashion.
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:43.160]   Well, Skinner would be proud of this kind of Christian parenting because it's all about the environment.
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:48.160]   It's the environment that causes the child to go wrong.
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:51.160]   It's the environment that marks that child's life for good or for bad.
[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:55.160]   So, you bring up a child in the good environment, the child will grow up good.
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:16:02.160]   You bring up a child in the bad environment, the child's going to grow up bad.
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:10.160]   That is traditional approach to child-rearing that is very behavioristic.
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:13.160]   And you can see this in a lot of Christian organizations across the country
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:17.160]   that promote a "Christian form of child-rearing."
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:21.160]   You read a lot of Christian books that are out there that promote a Christian form of child-rearing.
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:28.160]   A lot of that is very behavioristic, or if you take a look at exactly what they're saying, it's very Skinnerian.
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:32.160]   Now, we're not saying that you ignore the behavior of your child.
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:34.160]   We're not saying that at all.
[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:40.160]   But is it what we are establishing, is it the environment that determines the child's life?
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.160]   Is that really what determines life?
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:48.160]   It's interesting that here in the state of California several years ago, they did a series of studies.
[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:53.160]   In fact, they invested millions of dollars into taking career criminals
[00:16:53.160 --> 00:17:00.160]   and using this Skinnerian idea, giving them the best education possible, providing them with everything.
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:06.160]   So the theory is if you put those career criminals in a good environment with a good education,
[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:12.160]   then they will be naturally responsible citizens in society.
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:16.160]   And what they found out at the conclusion of their study, to their shock by the way,
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:22.160]   that they just had at the conclusion, once they graduated and gotten all their degrees and so on,
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:26.160]   they just now had really smart criminals.
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.160]   But they were still criminals.
[00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:30.160]   Their character had never changed.
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:32.160]   Their hearts had never changed.
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:38.160]   They were just more clever about what they were able to do.
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:41.160]   And that's the thinking here of a lot of Christians.
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:45.160]   You give your child the right environment, they're going to grow up right.
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:51.160]   And so a lot of Christian parents are very Skinnerian in their parenting, and they don't even know it.
[00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:59.160]   Well, it's true that if you read the English translation of the verse, you could take it that way.
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:03.160]   But it can also be properly understood another way.
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:08.160]   And it seems that the key phrase in this verse is a little phrase that's used in the English.
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:10.160]   It says, "In the way that he should go."
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:14.160]   The question is, what does that phrase mean?
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:22.160]   In fact, a similar Hebrew phraseology is used over in Proverbs 29 15.
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:26.160]   So if you want to grab your Bible just for a moment, put a marker here,
[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:30.160]   because we're going to come back to Proverbs 22 6.
[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:33.160]   But let's go over to Proverbs 29 15.
[00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:39.160]   And you notice the way the English translators here have chosen to translate this.
[00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:44.160]   It says, "The rod and reproof give instruction, but a child who," and here's our little phrase again,
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:48.160]   "who gets his own way brings shame to his mother."
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:52.160]   And in fact, that little phrase is footnoted, and you go to the footnote, and it says,
[00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:57.160]   "A child left to himself," and I really like that.
[00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:02.160]   That's probably getting at the core idea of this phrase.
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:06.160]   "But a child left to himself brings shame to his mother."
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:09.160]   That's the idea.
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:17.160]   "A child that's left to himself brings shame to his mother."
[00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:22.160]   Well, if that's the case, and you plug that back in, let's go back to Proverbs 22 6,
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:28.160]   and you were to take this similar phrase and train up a child and leave him to himself,
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:32.160]   and when he is old, he will not depart from it.
[00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:41.160]   Now that changes the entire sense of the verse, we could say.
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:46.160]   "If it is teaching that a child that is parented in such a way that the child is essentially left to himself
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:51.160]   or allowed to do his or her own thing."
[00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:54.160]   You know, I've had parents say that to me before in counseling.
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:57.160]   They've said that to me, but their whole philosophy of parenting is,
[00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:01.160]   "Well, you know, I'm just letting my kid learn in the school of hard knocks."
[00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:03.160]   That's the idea.
[00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:07.160]   "I'm just kind of letting that kid just learn by doing it the hard way."
[00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:13.160]   That's, in a sense, a laissez-faire approach to counseling.
[00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:17.160]   Or approach to parenting, I should say.
[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:20.160]   They're not getting involved in that child's life.
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:26.160]   They're not directing them in the right way.
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:37.160]   This also so changes the concept of the verse that we begin to sense that then it wouldn't be a guarantee.
[00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:43.160]   Instead, it would be a warning.
[00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:46.160]   It would be a warning.
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:54.160]   In fact, if you take a look at the Hebrew, it would go something like this.
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:59.160]   "Train up a child or really dedicate a child on the mouth of his way,"
[00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:03.160]   literally is the Hebrew, "on the mouth of his way."
[00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:08.160]   "And then when he is old, he will not turn aside from it."
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:11.160]   And that little phrase, "on the mouth of his way,"
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:19.160]   is an interesting little phrase there because it is an old Hebraism.
[00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:24.160]   Very, very old. It goes way back, ancient Hebrew.
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:29.160]   That means you let a child grow up according to what he wants to do
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:33.160]   or he says he will do on the mouth of his way.
[00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:36.160]   And when he is old, he will not depart from it.
[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:45.160]   You let him grow up according to his own opinion of himself and his environment and people.
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:52.160]   When he is old, he will not depart from it.
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:58.160]   The word for "train," the Hebrew word "hanach," means to dedicate.
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:08.160]   And it was actually used to dedicate a house or an image or the temple in the Old Testament.
[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:13.160]   And only here in Proverbs 22, 6 is the only place in the English Bible
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:19.160]   that we translate this word, "hanach," as "train."
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:27.160]   But the idea seems to be to dedicate or start.
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:32.160]   The concept behind the word means setting aside or narrowing or hedging in.
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:38.160]   So child training involves a narrowing of a child's conduct away from evil and towards godliness,
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:45.160]   starting him in the right direction.
[00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:52.160]   Or in some cases, it could be starting him in the mouth of his own way in the wrong direction,
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:54.160]   which is the propensity of his own heart.
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:57.160]   And that's the way I tend to see this.
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:08.160]   On the mouth of his way, according to what he wants to do.
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:13.160]   For example, this little phrase "upon the mouth of his way" is an old Hebrew idiom
[00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:16.160]   that means "according to" or "in accord with."
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:25.160]   A servant will respond upon the mouth or at the command of his superior, his master, back in ancient times.
[00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:32.160]   So, in this case, it would be the child responding to his own desires.
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:36.160]   You let a child grow up responding to his own desires,
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:44.160]   and when he is old, he will not be able to stop responding to his own desires.
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:49.160]   So, let's identify a principle here, if we can.
[00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:55.160]   We would say then that Proverbs 22.6 is not a promise.
[00:23:55.160 --> 00:24:04.160]   It is a warning for parents to be actively involved in their child's rearing.
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:11.160]   In fact, if we were to take it as a promise, that sort of violates the nature of a Hebrew proverb.
[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:18.160]   A proverb really is a literary device whereby a general truth is brought to bear upon a specific situation.
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:22.160]   Many of the proverbs are not intended to be absolute guarantees,
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:26.160]   like other parts of Scripture would be or other genres of Scripture would be.
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:35.160]   They are expressed truths that are necessarily conditioned by prevailing circumstances.
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:42.160]   We can see several examples of that in Proverbs, where Proverbs is stating a general truth.
[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:47.160]   Generally, this is true. There are exceptions to it, and God usually always gives the exceptions.
[00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:55.160]   Sometimes in the graduate program, I'll teach a class on Proverbs in counseling or Ecclesiastes in counseling,
[00:24:55.160 --> 00:25:01.160]   and one of the things I like to say is that Proverbs presents all the general rules,
[00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:08.160]   and Ecclesiastes all the exceptions to those rules.
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:16.160]   Now, if you take this as a promise, what you do is you place upon yourself exceptions or expectations
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:20.160]   that even the perfect parent would not.
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:24.160]   By the way, who is the perfect parent?
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:29.160]   God, right? God's the perfect parent.
[00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:35.160]   Well, what does God say about His own parenting?
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:45.160]   Grab your Bible just for a moment and go over to Isaiah chapter 1 and verse 2.
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:48.160]   "Listen, O heavens, and hear, O earth, for the Lord speaks.
[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:52.160]   Sons I have reared and brought up, but they have revolted against Me."
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:56.160]   Wow, that's the perfect parent speaking.
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:26:00.160]   "Sons I have reared and brought up, but they have revolted against Me."
[00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:06.160]   Did God ever do anything that was wrong towards His children? No.
[00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:13.160]   So He always responded to them perfectly.
[00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:17.160]   There are some parents who want to say, "If I had only been the perfect parent,
[00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:19.160]   then my kid wouldn't have turned out this way."
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:23.160]   No, they would have still turned out that way.
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:28.160]   Because it was in their heart to be that way.
[00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:33.160]   Now, that doesn't mean that we shouldn't do well by our children.
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:40.160]   That doesn't mean that we shouldn't try to do our best and be as good a godly parent as possible.
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:44.160]   But God is basically saying here, there are no guarantees.
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:54.160]   We bring them up the best way we know how, and then that kid, he or she, has a choice
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:57.160]   of whether or not they're going to follow the ways of the Lord,
[00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:08.160]   or whether or not they will not follow the ways of the Lord.
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:15.160]   So, He always, that is God always, did everything perfectly for His children,
[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:20.160]   and yet His sons revolted against Him.
[00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:30.160]   So, challenging the sinful heart of your child is going to be hard work that leaves no absolute guarantees.
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:35.160]   How many times have I sat across the desk from a Christian parent
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:39.160]   who really loved their kids and have done the best they possibly could.
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:44.160]   They weren't perfect, but they did the best they possibly could for their children.
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:49.160]   And their children grew up and ended up rejecting their father and mother's value system,
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:54.160]   rejecting what they stood for, rejecting even their father and mother's God
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:28:01.160]   and their commitment to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:05.160]   And in the process, just walked away from things of the Lord,
[00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:09.160]   and how much grief that brought to those parents' hearts.
[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:13.160]   Well, if you're a parent who takes Proverbs 22, 6 as a guarantee,
[00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:20.160]   then you begin to question the reliability of the Bible, or the credibility of the Bible.
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:24.160]   I mean, if the Bible guarantees me that my kids are going to turn out right
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:28.160]   if I bring them up the right way, then what's happened here?
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:32.160]   Well, the problem is that's not what the Bible does. The Bible doesn't do that.
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:38.160]   The Bible warns us that we need to do our best to parent our children,
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:44.160]   but there's no guarantees here. It's merely a warning.
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:51.160]   Secondly, I want you to see that there is a real balance here.
[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:56.160]   Biblical child-rearing must include a wise, progressive balance
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:29:00.160]   between structural and verbal discipline.
[00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:03.160]   And this is the text that we took a look at just a few moments ago
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:08.160]   over in Proverbs 29 and verse 15.
[00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:15.160]   He talks about the rod and reproof give wisdom.
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:20.160]   Both the rod, which is the physical punishment, children need that,
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:28.160]   and the verbal correction, which is the verbal punishment or verbal rebuke,
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:34.160]   are to be used in balance in child-rearing.
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:38.160]   Parenting requires a wise admonition of both types of discipline
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:44.160]   during the growth of a child, both rod and reproof.
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:49.160]   But a child, in contrast to that, who is left to himself or gets his own way,
[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:50.160]   will shame his mother.
[00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:53.160]   In other words, this is a child who hasn't had the proper rod
[00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:57.160]   and the proper reproof and instruction.
[00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:00.160]   The rod, in a sense, addresses the behavior.
[00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:09.160]   The reproof addresses the heart, the internal child.
[00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:13.160]   So you're addressing both.
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:16.160]   And failure to establish and maintain this balance
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:25.160]   will ultimately result in an unruly and frustrated child.
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:29.160]   A child who is not disciplined and is left to himself
[00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:34.160]   or allowed to do as he pleases and whatever he wants
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:36.160]   will become an unruly person.
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:42.160]   This kind of child will bring disgrace upon his parents.
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:45.160]   Now, there's a New Testament parallel to this.
[00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:46.160]   So grab your Bible just for a moment.
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:56.160]   Let's go over to Ephesians chapter 6 and verse 4.
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:31:02.160]   Ephesians chapter 6 and verse 4.
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:05.160]   "Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger
[00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:11.160]   and bring them up in the discipline and the instruction of the Lord."
[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:17.160]   You can see this same progressive balance here
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:22.160]   between structural and verbal discipline.
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:27.160]   The word "discipline" here in the New American Standard Bible
[00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:31.160]   is the Greek term paideia,
[00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:36.160]   which has to do with structural correction.
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:40.160]   This is equivalent to the rod there in Proverbs 29:15.
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:43.160]   It's the same thing.
[00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:49.160]   And then "instruction" is our word "nuthesia."
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:51.160]   That's where we get our word "nuthetic" from
[00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:54.160]   or "nuthetic counseling."
[00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:58.160]   It's a verbal correction by encouragement and reproof
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:01.160]   and warning and counsel.
[00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:03.160]   God has created every child with a conscience
[00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:06.160]   can be responsive to both the corrective training
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:10.160]   as well as the verbal admonition.
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:18.160]   That word "nuthesia" can mean admonish, warn, counsel.
[00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:21.160]   It can mean any of those ideas,
[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:23.160]   but that's what you want to do with the child,
[00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:28.160]   which helps to address that child's heart.
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:30.160]   Now, one of the best ways I like to illustrate this,
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:33.160]   especially in counseling for parents,
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:37.160]   is by putting out a chart something like this.
[00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:39.160]   From the time that a child is a little baby
[00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:41.160]   until they're a full-grown adult,
[00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:43.160]   probably around 20 years of age--
[00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:45.160]   that doesn't necessarily assume
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:47.160]   that they're totally mature as an adult,
[00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:50.160]   but at least they're 20 years of age--
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:52.160]   from that particular time,
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:54.160]   if we were to take this balance
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:56.160]   between the structural discipline
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:58.160]   and the verbal discipline,
[00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:02.160]   then it should look something like this.
[00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:04.160]   Because as a child is very young,
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:07.160]   that child, you can do all the verbal admonition you want.
[00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:11.160]   That child's not going to understand what you're saying.
[00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:15.160]   What they need is lots and lots of structural discipline.
[00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:19.160]   That's what they need.
[00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:23.160]   So, but as that child grows older,
[00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:27.160]   slowly there's less and less structural parameters,
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:34.160]   physical correction, and much more verbal correction.
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:38.160]   So, and this is where the rebuke comes in.
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:42.160]   The admonition, the instruction, the verbal correction,
[00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:49.160]   to the point where eventually that child has really all the--
[00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:51.160]   you've lost all opportunity to have
[00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:53.160]   any kind of physical correction in their life,
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:56.160]   but certainly you have the opportunity
[00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:59.160]   for a lot of verbal input.
[00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:01.160]   All of my children are at that age now.
[00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:05.160]   I have no physical correction left in their life.
[00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:08.160]   They're all adults, they're all functioning,
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:11.160]   and two daughters that have graduated from college
[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:13.160]   and are married, and now two sons
[00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:17.160]   that are about ready to graduate from college.
[00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:20.160]   But the opportunity for continuing admonition,
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:23.160]   instruction, and verbal correction is still there,
[00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:25.160]   and that's real key.
[00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:30.160]   We'll talk about that in a few minutes.
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:33.160]   So, as a child grows, there's less and less
[00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:35.160]   physical discipline and more and more
[00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:38.160]   moral or verbal discipline.
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:41.160]   And as a child grows and learns his or her environment,
[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:43.160]   the child has to grow in their understanding
[00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:53.160]   of how their own sinful heart is interacting
[00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:58.160]   with that environment, with those challenges,
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:01.160]   the lusts and the cravings that tend to come up
[00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:03.160]   from that heart, and ultimately the difference
[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:05.160]   that the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:08.160]   makes in their life.
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:10.160]   It starts in salvation but continues
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:13.160]   as the child grows in grace.
[00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:15.160]   So it's critical for Christian parents to learn
[00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:18.160]   how to gradually let up on making all the decisions
[00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:21.160]   for the child and instruct him or her
[00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:25.160]   on how to make godly decisions on their own.
[00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:27.160]   They may fail in their decision making,
[00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:29.160]   but the Christian home needs to be the kind of environment
[00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:31.160]   where they can be lovingly picked back up
[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:36.160]   and instructed on ultimately what went wrong.
[00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:39.160]   So, as a child is very young, much more rod
[00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:41.160]   than there is rebuke.
[00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:44.160]   But as the child grows older, much more rebuke
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:52.160]   and less and less rod.
[00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:54.160]   Now, remember this.
[00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:56.160]   Every disciplined event becomes an opportunity
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:36:00.160]   for the gospel.
[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:01.160]   Why?
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:03.160]   Because every time a child is disciplined,
[00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:06.160]   it's important that you help parents understand this.
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:08.160]   Every time a child is disciplined,
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:12.160]   a Christian parent should be saying to that child,
[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:16.160]   "What is it that God expects of you?
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:18.160]   What is it that God expects of you?"
[00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:23.160]   And the answer always is perfection.
[00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:29.160]   God expects that child to be perfect.
[00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:31.160]   We see, when a child is very young,
[00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:34.160]   that child assumes they can do that.
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:36.160]   "I can do that.
[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:38.160]   I can be perfect."
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:41.160]   But as time goes on and as more and more punishments come,
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:44.160]   because of their wicked sinful heart,
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:46.160]   they eventually, at some particular point,
[00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:47.160]   throw up their arms when you say,
[00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:49.160]   "What is it that God expects of you?"
[00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:53.160]   That child throws up his arms and says,
[00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:56.160]   "But I can't be perfect!"
[00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:59.160]   In frustration.
[00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:01.160]   And then, you understand,
[00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:05.160]   the doors are thrown wide open for the gospel.
[00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:11.160]   That's why you need Jesus Christ.
[00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:17.160]   That's why you need Jesus and His death on the cross.
[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:19.160]   You're right.
[00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:21.160]   You can't be perfect.
[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:26.160]   And it's like the lights come on for the kids.
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:29.160]   It's like, "Whoa!"
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:31.160]   Because up to this particular point,
[00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:35.160]   they think that Jesus is just an additive to their life.
[00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:38.160]   Now they understand that Jesus is not just an additive.
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:41.160]   It's not just a nice thing that I add to my life.
[00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:46.160]   Jesus Christ is my only hope.
[00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:48.160]   I can't be perfect.
[00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:50.160]   And my mom and my dad have reminded me
[00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:52.160]   that that's what God expects.
[00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:57.160]   Absolute, 100% perfection.
[00:37:57.160 --> 00:38:01.160]   Wow.
[00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:06.160]   Now, what we get in society and culture is something like this.
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:08.160]   And we get a lot of this today.
[00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:11.160]   We have homes that are not growing up in a biblical way,
[00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:14.160]   or they're not using this in the right way.
[00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:16.160]   And those homes look something like this.
[00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:20.160]   This is, in a sense, the laid-back style of parenting
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:23.160]   that has been popularized by Benjamin Spock.
[00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:27.160]   In American European culture, maybe you don't remember,
[00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:31.160]   but certainly I remember and my parents remember.
[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:34.160]   Benjamin Spock, back in the 1950s, 1960s, and '70s,
[00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:40.160]   had a huge influence upon American parents.
[00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:43.160]   Benjamin Spock, impressionistic child psychologist today,
[00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:46.160]   this is their view of what the home should be like.
[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:49.160]   That is, lots and lots of verbal correction,
[00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:55.160]   little or no rod or consequences.
[00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:57.160]   In fact, this is what we would call
[00:38:57.160 --> 00:39:00.160]   probably the permissive home.
[00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:04.160]   This is the permissive home.
[00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:06.160]   Parents are afraid to do anything
[00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:08.160]   that would wound the psyche of their children,
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:10.160]   so they rarely punish them.
[00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:12.160]   But they're always trying to provide positive reinforcement
[00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:15.160]   for good behavior, which is Skinnerian.
[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:18.160]   There's often lots of verbal instruction and admonition
[00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:21.160]   that's going on, seldom any worthwhile consequences
[00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:25.160]   for sinful behavior.
[00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:28.160]   And more often than not, if you find in your church
[00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:32.160]   or your counseling ministry single-parent homes,
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:36.160]   especially where mom is the custodial parent,
[00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:39.160]   it becomes this kind of a home frequently.
[00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:41.160]   Not always, but frequently.
[00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:43.160]   She believes that children have already suffered enough
[00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:46.160]   with the loss of their father, either by divorce or by death,
[00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:48.160]   and she can't stand to implement
[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:50.160]   any kind of painful consequences on the children,
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:53.160]   and frequently these children actually, as they grow up,
[00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:55.160]   lose respect for their mother
[00:39:55.160 --> 00:40:01.160]   and eventually grow up actually hating her.
[00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:04.160]   So sometimes you get homes that are extremely permissive,
[00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:07.160]   really laid-back homes,
[00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:10.160]   where there's very little rod,
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:15.160]   lots and lots of verbal admonition.
[00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:17.160]   Or you may get the opposite.
[00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:19.160]   You may find yourself in a church
[00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:21.160]   with a lot of homes this way.
[00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:24.160]   And this is the harsh home,
[00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:28.160]   and it has a very flat view of Christian parenting.
[00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:30.160]   For a couple like this,
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:33.160]   parenting is a set of do's and don'ts.
[00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:37.160]   Lots and lots of rod, very little verbal correction.
[00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:40.160]   In fact, if the kids ask the parents,
[00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:42.160]   "Why should I do that?"
[00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:47.160]   Well, the answer comes always, "Because I said so."
[00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:51.160]   All right?
[00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:55.160]   This type of home routinely produces an angry,
[00:40:55.160 --> 00:41:00.160]   exasperated child, like the previous home.
[00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:02.160]   And once this child is outside of the home,
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:04.160]   he or she are going to throw off all restraint
[00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:07.160]   and fully indulge their sinful natures.
[00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:10.160]   Mom and dad is usually often very demanding,
[00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:13.160]   very dictatorial with the children.
[00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:14.160]   Living in a home like this
[00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:17.160]   is like living in a military boot camp.
[00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:19.160]   Very difficult.
[00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:22.160]   Very little time is given to interaction with the children.
[00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:24.160]   The parents are viewed as cops
[00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:28.160]   that are lurking around the corner,
[00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:34.160]   trying to find every little infraction of the law.
[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:36.160]   And homes like this have parents
[00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:41.160]   that sometimes are in very high-demanding jobs
[00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:44.160]   or military-type situations,
[00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:46.160]   and they produce young girls
[00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:48.160]   with anorexia neurosa or bulimia
[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:50.160]   because this is the only area of their life
[00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:51.160]   that these girls find out
[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:56.160]   that they can have any control in.
[00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:58.160]   So you can have the permissive home,
[00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:00.160]   you can have the dictatorial home,
[00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:06.160]   or here's a type of home you can have as well.
[00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:08.160]   This particular home will produce a child
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:11.160]   that brings its mother shame
[00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:16.160]   or will be provoked to wrath or anger.
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:20.160]   This is the dictatorial home.
[00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:22.160]   There's another one.
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:26.160]   This particular home.
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:30.160]   And I often ask, "What's going on here in this home?"
[00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:33.160]   Well, usually, lots and lots of freedom
[00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:35.160]   right up to this particular age,
[00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:37.160]   and this is just a hypothetical age,
[00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:40.160]   so you can move this line either direction on this timeline
[00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:43.160]   of how this child has grown up.
[00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:45.160]   But what has happened here?
[00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:50.160]   Well, the parents get saved.
[00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:53.160]   Prior to their salvation, everybody--
[00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:57.160]   this is just kind of a loose home.
[00:42:57.160 --> 00:42:59.160]   But all of a sudden, they get saved,
[00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:00.160]   and these parents begin to think,
[00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:02.160]   "I've got to make up for lost time."
[00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:06.160]   And so, boy, they throw in the rules and regulations.
[00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:09.160]   And it's not uncommon for children in this type of home
[00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:12.160]   to wish their parents were back in their pagan days.
[00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:15.160]   Life has become miserable for them.
[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:17.160]   Mom and dad have good intentions,
[00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:19.160]   but they are inadvertently teaching their children
[00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:22.160]   that Christianity really is a bunch of rules
[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:24.160]   and harsh regulations.
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:27.160]   They hate it, and they ultimately will reject
[00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:29.160]   their parents' God.
[00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:32.160]   This type of home also will eventually produce a child
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:36.160]   that will bring shame or will be provoked to anger
[00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:40.160]   or--there in Ephesians 6:4, some translations have translated
[00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:44.160]   that Greek term "exasperation."
[00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:55.160]   Pure exasperation.
[00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:59.160]   Parogizomai--it's a present active imperative--
[00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:02.160]   has the idea to make anger or to bring one along
[00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:06.160]   to a deep-seated anger.
[00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:09.160]   And the preposition here in the compound
[00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:17.160]   indicates really an ongoing type of motion.
[00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:22.160]   So Paul warns, "Don't bring up your child in such a way
[00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:26.160]   that you provoke that child to anger."
[00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:30.160]   You can do that if you have a pet like a dog.
[00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:33.160]   If you have a dog, and that dog is a generally
[00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:36.160]   well-mannered dog, and you take a stick
[00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:38.160]   and you keep poking that dog and poking that dog,
[00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:42.160]   that dog is going to get angry at you and eventually bite you.
[00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:47.160]   Well, the same thing is true with a child like this.
[00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:49.160]   You keep poking the child and poking the child,
[00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:53.160]   it brings anger and exasperation out in this child.
[00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:59.160]   So this is what we call the new Christian home.
[00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:01.160]   So we would say this.
[00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:05.160]   Thirdly, then, the use of the rod involves the option
[00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:07.160]   of corporal punishment as well as other types
[00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:14.160]   of physical restraint and chastisement.
[00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:17.160]   Most older parents understand that the use
[00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:20.160]   of corporal punishment gradually has diminishing returns
[00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:23.160]   as the child physically grows older.
[00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:27.160]   When applied under control, not giving full vent
[00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:32.160]   to a person's anger, as Proverbs 29:11 talks about,
[00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:37.160]   the rod is effective while children are still young,
[00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:40.160]   small, juniors.
[00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:43.160]   As a child becomes the parent's physical equal
[00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:45.160]   in high school and college, the rod becomes
[00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:47.160]   an ineffective punishment.
[00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:51.160]   However, there are things that can equal the rod.
[00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:54.160]   Nowadays, you take away a child's cell phone
[00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:58.160]   and they think they've died.
[00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:03.160]   You take away their Nintendo or their iPod.
[00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:09.160]   You think this is a fate worse than death.
[00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:11.160]   In fact, God used a variety of methods
[00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:13.160]   to chastise his children.
[00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:16.160]   Proverbs' use of the rod can be taken in Hebrew poetry
[00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:18.160]   to be a metaphorical reference to other types
[00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:20.160]   of punishment as well.
[00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:24.160]   It doesn't always have to be literally a rod.
[00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:27.160]   A loving parent, Proverbs 13:24,
[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:30.160]   will inflict temporary discomfort on the children
[00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:32.160]   by spanking them, sometimes with a rod,
[00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:35.160]   or by causing them to be discomforted
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:43.160]   by something else similar.
[00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:50.160]   Proverbs 19:18, here the verse is an imperative.
[00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:52.160]   It says, "Discipline your son."
[00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:53.160]   It's a command.
[00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:57.160]   It's a strong warning against parental passivity.
[00:46:57.160 --> 00:47:00.160]   We have a responsibility to do that.
[00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:07.160]   So a child that's guilty of misdeeds has to be punished.
[00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:15.160]   That's Proverbs 19:18.
[00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:17.160]   To neglect this kind of discipline is going
[00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:22.160]   to contribute to the child's death, the Bible says.
[00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:25.160]   Now, we're not sure exactly what that death refers to.
[00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:29.160]   Maybe it referred to capital punishment under the law,
[00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:31.160]   Deuteronomy 21, verses 18 through 21,
[00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:34.160]   or to the danger of some kind of natural consequences
[00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:37.160]   that accompany a child's foolish behavior,
[00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:39.160]   like a law that says, "I don't want you to go
[00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:41.160]   and play in the street.
[00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:44.160]   Otherwise, you're going to get run over."
[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:48.160]   Ultimately, because of this misdeed and behavior,
[00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:53.160]   it ends up killing him.
[00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:54.160]   Children need discipline.
[00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:56.160]   In fact, grab your Bible for a moment.
[00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:59.160]   Let's go over to Proverbs 23.
[00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:03.160]   A little bit later on there in Proverbs,
[00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:09.160]   in verse 13, he says, "Do not hold back discipline
[00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:10.160]   from the child.
[00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:13.160]   Although you strike him with the rod, he will not die.
[00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:17.160]   You shall strike him with the rod and rescue his soul
[00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:21.160]   from Sheol."
[00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:25.160]   So the pain here that's caused by spanking can make
[00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:31.160]   the parent and the child think the child's going to die.
[00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:32.160]   But that's not so.
[00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:35.160]   The punishment will actually deliver the child from death,
[00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:38.160]   not cause his death.
[00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:44.160]   That punishment will help the child.
[00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:48.160]   So it's important to be willing to discipline a child,
[00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:53.160]   and that discipline is to be greater and more frequent
[00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:57.160]   when that child especially is younger.
[00:48:57.160 --> 00:48:59.160]   But then the other side of it has to do
[00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:01.160]   with verbal correction.
[00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:04.160]   Verbal correction then is just as important
[00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:10.160]   as that child especially grows up.
[00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:13.160]   Now, Proverbs really is full of parental pleas
[00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:16.160]   for the son to listen to his father's counsel.
[00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:18.160]   Clear back in chapter 2, verses 1 through 10,
[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:26.160]   you can see that strong if/then long extended sentences
[00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:29.160]   are set up there in Proverbs chapter 2.
[00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:33.160]   Simply punishing a child for misbehavior and announcing,
[00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:37.160]   now don't do that again, it's poor parenting.
[00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:44.160]   Parents should not be mere behaviorists.
[00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:46.160]   Lazy parents won't take the time to address
[00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:49.160]   the internal issues of a child's heart.
[00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:53.160]   Your goal is to speak to a child's heart.
[00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:59.160]   Help that child understand what's going on in their heart.
[00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:02.160]   Help them identify the desires that tend to rule his heart
[00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:08.160]   and in a sense become his functional gods
[00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:13.160]   that he bows down to.
[00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:15.160]   Several years ago, I'll never forget,
[00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:17.160]   I have twin boys and the boys were exposed
[00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:21.160]   to Nintendo for the first time.
[00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:23.160]   I'll never forget that experience
[00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:30.160]   and how the boys, they got into a fight with one another
[00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:32.160]   and I heard them yell and I went downstairs
[00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:34.160]   and I saw one twin with his fingers
[00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:38.160]   around the neck of the other one.
[00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:40.160]   So, you want to see depravity in your children,
[00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:44.160]   just give them Nintendo.
[00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:47.160]   Now, it'd be very easy to say, "All right, now stop that.
[00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:48.160]   I don't want to hear either of you two
[00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:51.160]   and give them a good whack and go on about your business."
[00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:53.160]   But to sit down with each one of those boys
[00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:57.160]   and to address their hearts.
[00:50:57.160 --> 00:50:59.160]   What was it in your heart that you wanted so much
[00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:01.160]   that you were willing to strangle your brother
[00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:06.160]   in order to get it?
[00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:09.160]   Or what about the other boy who was being strangled?
[00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:11.160]   What is it in your heart that you were willing to do
[00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:16.160]   to entice your brother to act in such a violent way towards you?
[00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:18.160]   What is it that you wanted so bad?
[00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:22.160]   I wanted to win that game more than anything else.
[00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:26.160]   That was more important than my relationship to my brother.
[00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:29.160]   That became, at that particular point, your functional God.
[00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:32.160]   That became the God that you bowed down to and worshipped.
[00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:36.160]   That's the desires that ruled your heart at that point.
[00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:39.160]   Help them identify how those impure desires
[00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:41.160]   dictate their attitudes and behaviors.
[00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:44.160]   How does that happen?
[00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:47.160]   That takes more time.
[00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:51.160]   Behavioristic parenting is very easy.
[00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:54.160]   That's for lazy parents.
[00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:56.160]   But when you're trying to address the internal issues
[00:51:56.160 --> 00:52:00.160]   of a child's heart, that takes a lot.
[00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:02.160]   A lot of time.
[00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:06.160]   So this is going to include rebuke, admonition,
[00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:10.160]   encouragement, help, entreaty, persuasion,
[00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:13.160]   all of those good biblical words
[00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:18.160]   to help a child understand the issues of his or her heart.
[00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:23.160]   Let me see if we can help you to understand this
[00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:26.160]   in terms of a chart here.
[00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:31.160]   I think this will help you.
[00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:36.160]   As that child grows,
[00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:39.160]   there's nothing you can do about it.
[00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:43.160]   You're going to lose your authority with that child.
[00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:46.160]   You can be a big, strong, mean parent,
[00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:50.160]   but you're still going to lose your authority.
[00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:53.160]   You can try to turn your home into a military boot camp
[00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:56.160]   and control every decision your child makes,
[00:52:56.160 --> 00:53:00.160]   and eventually your children are going to go AWOL
[00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:02.160]   when they get old.
[00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:04.160]   Maintaining tough discipline over the child
[00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:08.160]   as they grow older is not going to help.
[00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:10.160]   It's not going to help.
[00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:12.160]   Maintaining tough discipline over the child
[00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:18.160]   as they grow older will only build resentment.
[00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:20.160]   There are a lot of parents who do that.
[00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:23.160]   They have almost a military-type home
[00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:25.160]   from the time that child is born
[00:53:25.160 --> 00:53:27.160]   until that child becomes 20,
[00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:30.160]   and then when they turn 20, the parents send them off
[00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:32.160]   to probably a Christian school
[00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:34.160]   that is known for all its rules and regulations
[00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:37.160]   to try to hold on to them and maintain their life again.
[00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:39.160]   None of those children end up growing up
[00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:41.160]   or graduating from those schools
[00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:44.160]   and then rejecting everything.
[00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:51.160]   They never internalize their faith.
[00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:53.160]   But really, what should be happening,
[00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:56.160]   if you're properly admonishing your child on a verbal level,
[00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:59.160]   what should be happening is, as time goes on,
[00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:06.160]   your influence grows even though your authority decreases.
[00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:08.160]   If you want your children to respect you in the future
[00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:10.160]   and seek you out for advice,
[00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:14.160]   then you have to start building into their lives
[00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:17.160]   an understanding of their own heart motivations
[00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:19.160]   that is critical for godliness.
[00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:22.160]   They've got to be convinced from a young age
[00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:25.160]   that you have their best long-term values in mind
[00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:30.160]   every step of the way.
[00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:32.160]   I like the illustration that Ted Tripp uses
[00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:34.160]   in his book "Shepherding the Heart of a Child"
[00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:36.160]   when he talks about presidential advisors.
[00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:39.160]   He says, "Presidential advisors have no constitutional authority
[00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:41.160]   "in the United States Constitution."
[00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:43.160]   No constitutional authority at all.
[00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:45.160]   Nothing on the books.
[00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:47.160]   But they have plenty of influence
[00:54:47.160 --> 00:54:49.160]   in the decisions of a president.
[00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:52.160]   Same thing's true with parents of older children.
[00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:54.160]   Many of them have no authority at all
[00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:56.160]   in those kids' life any longer.
[00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:58.160]   Those children are adults now.
[00:54:58.160 --> 00:55:01.160]   But they have loads of influence
[00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:04.160]   because over the years they've built that in
[00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:10.160]   through constant, very patient admonition.
[00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:15.160]   Where you take the time to address their soul, their heart.
[00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:18.160]   You teach them how to make wise, godly decisions
[00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:23.160]   by taking stock of their own desires of their heart.
[00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:28.160]   It's that kind of thing.
[00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:34.160]   I know that as a parent with two daughters
[00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:36.160]   that are grown and married now,
[00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:40.160]   when my daughters and son-in-laws call my wife and I up
[00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:42.160]   and they're trying to make a decision
[00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:45.160]   and they seek our opinion about that decision,
[00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:47.160]   it's a great honor.
[00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:49.160]   What do you think about this, Mommy and Dad?
[00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:52.160]   Because they believe we'll give them the wisest decision
[00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:56.160]   we could give them from our perspective.
[00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:57.160]   But you know what?
[00:55:57.160 --> 00:55:58.160]   That doesn't happen automatically.
[00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:00.160]   There are some parents who think they expect their children
[00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:04.160]   to do that just by sheer fact that they're their parents.
[00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:08.160]   But the children don't respect them.
[00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:13.160]   You have to build that into your children over the years.
[00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:14.160]   Well, there's a final principle here
[00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:15.160]   and then we'll take a break.
[00:56:15.160 --> 00:56:18.160]   Harmony in your marriage is really vital
[00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:19.160]   to effective parenting.
[00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:22.160]   This is really critical to point out in counseling.
[00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:23.160]   Harmony in your marriage.
[00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:28.160]   Proverbs, let's go back to Proverbs 17, 1 again.
[00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:30.160]   "Better is a dry morsel and quietness with it
[00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:34.160]   than a house full of feasting with strife."
[00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:37.160]   This whole chapter of Proverbs 17
[00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:42.160]   relates closely to loosely or loosely to strife and peace.
[00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:47.160]   And here it starts off about strife and peace in the home.
[00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:49.160]   And we know this.
[00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:53.160]   It's very interesting how many children manifesting
[00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:55.160]   ADD and ADHD-like symptoms
[00:56:55.160 --> 00:56:57.160]   come from homes filled with marital strife.
[00:56:57.160 --> 00:56:59.160]   Now, I don't say that.
[00:56:59.160 --> 00:57:05.160]   National and international statistics say that.
[00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:06.160]   Why?
[00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:14.160]   Because children are a barometer of the home and the marriage.
[00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:17.160]   Children are a barometer of the home and the marriage.
[00:57:17.160 --> 00:57:19.160]   Yes, a child has its own choice,
[00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:24.160]   and a child can grow up and choose an evil, wicked way.
[00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:27.160]   But when children are especially young,
[00:57:27.160 --> 00:57:29.160]   their attitudes and behaviors reflect
[00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:36.160]   what's going on in that home.
[00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:38.160]   And there are an awful lot of church families out there
[00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:40.160]   that have beautiful houses,
[00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:44.160]   but they do not have an attractive Christian home
[00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:48.160]   because of strife.
[00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:51.160]   Strife that has just torn them apart.
[00:57:51.160 --> 00:57:58.160]   You know, it's better to have just dry morsel with quietness.
[00:57:58.160 --> 00:58:01.160]   I used to pastor in a location where all around us
[00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:02.160]   were beautiful, beautiful homes.
[00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:04.160]   In fact, some of them were so nice,
[00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:05.160]   they had big iron fences around them.
[00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:09.160]   You had to go up and press a little buzzer at the gate,
[00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:15.160]   and then a maid would answer the gate buzzer.
[00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:18.160]   And I counseled a lot of the homes and the couples
[00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:21.160]   that lived in those homes, and they had beautiful homes,
[00:58:21.160 --> 00:58:25.160]   indoor pools, indoor bowling alleys in these homes,
[00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:29.160]   but their homes were full of marital strife,
[00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:32.160]   and all of the children reflected it.
[00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:35.160]   I remember some of the young teenage children saying to me
[00:58:35.160 --> 00:58:38.160]   in counseling, "I would far rather that we lived
[00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:41.160]   in a little shack and Mom and Dad were at peace
[00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:48.160]   with each other than to have the home that we live in."
[00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:51.160]   And I believe those kids really meant that,
[00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:56.160]   and they reflected the whole attitude of Proverbs 17:1.
[00:58:56.160 --> 00:58:58.160]   A house that's full of feasting,
[00:58:58.160 --> 00:59:00.160]   that you can have anything that you want,
[00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:01.160]   anything you want to eat.
[00:59:01.160 --> 00:59:03.160]   It's an abundant house.
[00:59:03.160 --> 00:59:07.160]   It's a wealthy house, and yet it's a house full of strife.
[00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:11.160]   So harmony in the marriage is vital,
[00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:13.160]   vital to effective parenting.
[00:59:13.160 --> 00:59:16.160]   Oftentimes, you'll find out in your own counseling ministry,
[00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:20.160]   the place where you start is not with how the parents
[00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:21.160]   are dealing with the children.
[00:59:21.160 --> 00:59:23.160]   In fact, oftentimes, parents will come in,
[00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:26.160]   and they'll drag their kids into counseling,
[00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:30.160]   and they'll say to you, "Fix my kid."
[00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:32.160]   You know, the kid doesn't need fixed.
[00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:35.160]   Mom and Dad needs fixed.
[00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:41.160]   They don't want to hear that, but that's the real issue.
[00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:45.160]   Okay, we want to talk about God's design
[00:59:45.160 --> 00:59:48.160]   for blended families next, and this is one of those topics
[00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:51.160]   where I wish we had several hours to work with,
[00:59:51.160 --> 00:59:52.160]   and we don't.
[00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:55.160]   We only have one hour to deal with this particular issue,
[00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:59.160]   but I do want to set some of the basic background framework
[00:59:59.160 --> 01:00:06.160]   for this, for counseling this kind of a situation.
[01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:08.160]   In fact, I think you're going to find out in your own
[01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:11.160]   counseling ministries that dealing with blended family
[01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:14.160]   conflicts is going to be one of the most challenging types
[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:17.160]   of counseling that you'll face.
[01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:20.160]   Now, the whole label "blended families" is really
[01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:24.160]   a secular label that is somewhat misleading.
[01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:28.160]   In fact, the usage of the label by most people
[01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:33.160]   and psychologists create, I believe, a lot of ambiguity
[01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:35.160]   and typifies the reason why there's so much struggle
[01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:41.160]   and difficulty in resolving the problem that it represents.
[01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:44.160]   Two distinct people with their respective children
[01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:50.160]   who are properly married do not form a blended family.
[01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:52.160]   They form a family.
[01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:56.160]   Whether they or their children wish to acknowledge it or not,
[01:00:56.160 --> 01:01:02.160]   they are one family in God's eyes, not blended.
[01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:05.160]   So I think we have to resist the human tendency to think of them
[01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:08.160]   as two distinct families living under one roof
[01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:12.160]   who have to put up or cope with one another.
[01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:15.160]   If they're legitimately married, the Bible says,
[01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:18.160]   "What God has joined together, they're no longer two,
[01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:21.160]   but now they're one."
[01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:24.160]   And I realize they may not feel like they're a family,
[01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:28.160]   they may not function like they're one family,
[01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:30.160]   and they certainly may not consider themselves
[01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:34.160]   to be a family.
[01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:39.160]   But that does not change the fact that they are.
[01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:43.160]   I spent six years in the military,
[01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:45.160]   and when I first got in the military,
[01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:48.160]   I didn't function like a soldier, I didn't think like a soldier,
[01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:54.160]   but that did not change the fact that I was a soldier.
[01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:57.160]   In other words, at the very core of their problems
[01:01:57.160 --> 01:02:03.160]   is the way that the members of this family
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:08.160]   thinks about themselves.
[01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:11.160]   Sometimes I prefer actually calling this,
[01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:13.160]   rather than blended family,
[01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:16.160]   a step-family with step-parenting
[01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:18.160]   and step-partnering problems,
[01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:25.160]   because ultimately that's where the real struggle lies.
[01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:27.160]   Now, what I would like to do is I'd like to give you
[01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:30.160]   a typical scenario that you may face in your ministry
[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:33.160]   when counseling a family like this.
[01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:36.160]   And if this scenario sounds like any particular family you know,
[01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:38.160]   it's only by coincidence,
[01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:42.160]   because the case study's generally fictitious,
[01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:50.160]   but it is built upon my own counseling experiences.
[01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:54.160]   Now, according to national statistics on family life in America,
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:56.160]   the most typical step-family with problems
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:59.160]   have a divorced father whose biological children
[01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:04.160]   live with their biological mother, his ex-wife.
[01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:07.160]   And this divorced father now has remarried a divorced woman
[01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:09.160]   with an average of two biological children of her own
[01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:11.160]   still living with her.
[01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:17.160]   That's your average step-family.
[01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:19.160]   Now, the case study that I want to present to you
[01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:22.160]   is a slight variation on that theme.
[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:29.160]   And I've specifically and deliberately picked the variations
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:32.160]   in order to highlight some important features here
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:37.160]   that I think will be important in your own ministry.
[01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:43.160]   So I want to take a look at a couple by the name of Larry and Judy.
[01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:46.160]   Larry and Judy.
[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:48.160]   They are a couple who were previously married
[01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:52.160]   and they found each other at church and immediately hit it off.
[01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:55.160]   Larry had been divorced for less than two years,
[01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:59.160]   but Judy had been widowed for almost eight years.
[01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:02.160]   Everyone at home believed that they were the ideal couple.
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:06.160]   In fact, a couple of self-appointed matchmakers at their church
[01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:09.160]   took credit for putting the two together.
[01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:11.160]   And by the way, as a sideline parenthesis,
[01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:13.160]   it's always amazing to me how these matchmakers
[01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:15.160]   fade into the background when it becomes obvious
[01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:21.160]   this new couple is having problems.
[01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:25.160]   Judy has two teenage daughters and a nine-year-old son
[01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:28.160]   from their first marriage living with her.
[01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:32.160]   Larry has a daughter of 13 years and a son of 10
[01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:36.160]   that lives with his ex-wife.
[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:38.160]   During their courtship, everybody was excited
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:41.160]   except for Judy's teenage daughters,
[01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:43.160]   who stood afar off from the whole thing,
[01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:46.160]   and they were very polite, but they were confused
[01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:48.160]   and didn't know what to think.
[01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:51.160]   On the one hand, they were both happy that Mom seemed to be so happy,
[01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:53.160]   happier than they could remember her for years.
[01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:55.160]   And on the other hand, they were not comfortable with the fact
[01:04:55.160 --> 01:05:00.160]   that Judy--or that Larry was taking so much of Mom's time
[01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:04.160]   and was beginning to act a little like a father figure with them.
[01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:05.160]   He wasn't their father.
[01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:07.160]   Their father was in heaven,
[01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:14.160]   and he could never take their father or replace their father.
[01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:17.160]   Any suggestion of that was really repulsive to them.
[01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:21.160]   Judy's son didn't seem to mind Larry's sudden intrusion into their home
[01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:24.160]   because he was only one when his father had died,
[01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:28.160]   and he always wanted a dad.
[01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:32.160]   Larry's ex-wife had left him for another man,
[01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:34.160]   who she was living with and refused to return
[01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:37.160]   even after going through church discipline.
[01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:40.160]   The divorce seemed to be fresh in the minds of Larry's two children
[01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:45.160]   when he introduced them to their future stepmother, Judy.
[01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:47.160]   They disliked her from the beginning.
[01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:51.160]   After all, they still hoped Mom and Dad would eventually get back together again,
[01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:55.160]   and this new stepmother was a serious threat to that dream.
[01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:59.160]   At least their biological mom had not married her boyfriend.
[01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:02.160]   Both Larry and Judy noticed the awkwardness and the tension
[01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:05.160]   when they first took a picnic with the two sets of children.
[01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:08.160]   Both attributed it to adjustment jitters,
[01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:12.160]   which would only be a temporary thing.
[01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:17.160]   Once everyone got settled in, everything would work out, they reasoned.
[01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:19.160]   Even Larry's ex-wife didn't like the idea of Judy,
[01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:21.160]   not because she wanted to come back to Larry,
[01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:26.160]   but if Larry married Judy, then the courts would view that as a more stable home
[01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:31.160]   and she potentially could lose custody of her daughter and her son.
[01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:35.160]   Well, in spite of all these red flags and the excitement of their romance
[01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:37.160]   and believing that would eventually blow over,
[01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:40.160]   Larry and Judy decided to marry.
[01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:43.160]   With the exception of Judy's youngest son,
[01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:46.160]   both sets of children did not want to come to the wedding.
[01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:49.160]   In fact, one of Judy's daughters showed up in a black dress
[01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:52.160]   to protest the marriage.
[01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:58.160]   By the way, that actually happened in the counseling situation.
[01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:02.160]   Judy was angry and hurt, but withheld her comments
[01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:04.160]   to try to preserve the happiness of the occasion.
[01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:06.160]   She tried to smooth it over with Larry by saying,
[01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:10.160]   "You know, teenagers, changes are always hard on them.
[01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:12.160]   She'll get over it soon."
[01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:17.160]   Regardless of Judy's efforts to smooth it over, Larry did worry.
[01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:20.160]   After a dreamy honeymoon on the Isle of Maui,
[01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:24.160]   the newlyweds returned to a tension-filled household.
[01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:27.160]   Both Larry and Judy were determined to make it work.
[01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:30.160]   Larry found out that Judy's daughters greeted him with a silence treatment.
[01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:33.160]   He decided to make the best of it by treating them kindly
[01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:37.160]   until six weeks had passed and things were only worse.
[01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:40.160]   Every time they had a problem with homework,
[01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:42.160]   they would always go to their mother.
[01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:46.160]   When Larry was home alone with them, they refused his help.
[01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:49.160]   Larry was reaching the boiling point.
[01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:53.160]   He found that he and Judy were arguing more and more about the children.
[01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:55.160]   And to make matters worse, when Larry's children visited,
[01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:59.160]   they didn't like Judy's cooking and would often refuse to eat.
[01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:01.160]   On weekends, when they were in the home,
[01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:04.160]   a turf war between the two sets of children would break out,
[01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:06.160]   and Judy's girls let Larry's daughter know
[01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:10.160]   that she was not welcome in their home.
[01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:14.160]   Furthermore, even though Judy's 10-year-old son
[01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:17.160]   enjoyed having Larry as his new father,
[01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:20.160]   he resented Larry's biological son coming on weekends.
[01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:22.160]   He felt that Larry favored his son
[01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:25.160]   and would leave him out of their times together.
[01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:30.160]   He looked for times to secretly remind Larry's son
[01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:34.160]   that he had his father most of the time
[01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:38.160]   and sought to drive a wedge between Larry and his son.
[01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:40.160]   And it was beginning to work.
[01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:42.160]   Larry noticed that his biological son
[01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:45.160]   was speaking more and more favorably about his ex-wife's boyfriend
[01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:47.160]   and all the fun that they were having,
[01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:49.160]   going to amusement parks and ball games.
[01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:52.160]   This left Larry with a sinking feeling inside,
[01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:55.160]   especially since this boyfriend was not a Christian
[01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:57.160]   and refused to go to church.
[01:08:57.160 --> 01:08:59.160]   Then add to the fact that Larry's church
[01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:02.160]   had disciplined his new girlfriend for leaving Larry,
[01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:05.160]   so he was sour on Christians and church.
[01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:08.160]   To make matters worse, his influence on Larry's son
[01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:12.160]   was a bad one that resulted in a bad attitude and vocabulary.
[01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:15.160]   Every weekend, it seemed that Larry spent half of his time
[01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:18.160]   trying to correct bad attitudes and behavior
[01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:20.160]   in both his daughter and son.
[01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:23.160]   From Larry's perspective, he thought he would see some improvement
[01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:25.160]   after six months of marriage.
[01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:27.160]   But the opposite seemed to be true.
[01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:32.160]   Instead of peace, things in the family were beginning to unravel.
[01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:34.160]   Judy noticed the same thing.
[01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:36.160]   She was beginning to realize that she didn't like the way
[01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:38.160]   that Larry ran the household.
[01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:41.160]   It was not the way that she and her children were used to.
[01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:42.160]   They didn't like his rules.
[01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:43.160]   They were rigid and flexible.
[01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:45.160]   She found herself siding with her daughters
[01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:49.160]   when they denounced, "That's not the way that mom does it."
[01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:53.160]   Larry, too, noted they had very different parenting styles,
[01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:55.160]   and her daughters didn't accept his new role
[01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:57.160]   as head of the household.
[01:09:57.160 --> 01:10:00.160]   Increasingly, he discovered that if he tried to exercise discipline
[01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:02.160]   or use any kind of parental authority over them,
[01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:06.160]   he was overruled when they appealed to their mother.
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:08.160]   All their dreams of having a loving Christian home
[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:11.160]   were quickly vanishing.
[01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:15.160]   After a year, so much resentment and bitterness had built up
[01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:19.160]   that it was impossible to have fun together as a family.
[01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:26.160]   The tension in the household was so thick you could cut it with a knife.
[01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:29.160]   Larry was spending more and more of his time at the office,
[01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:32.160]   and Judy and the kids seemed to be happy with that.
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:34.160]   Their dream had turned into a horrid nightmare.
[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:37.160]   Even people at church knew something was wrong.
[01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:40.160]   Judy's daughters could say nothing good about their stepdad.
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:43.160]   They would always refer to him with disgust as "That Larry,"
[01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:47.160]   not as a father, dad, or even stepdad.
[01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:49.160]   People could also see that Larry and Judy
[01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:51.160]   were not the happy Christians they used to be.
[01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:53.160]   It seemed like they were dying on the inside.
[01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:56.160]   There was no joy in their lives, just mere existence.
[01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:58.160]   Their goal became a simple one--
[01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:02.160]   just make it through another day.
[01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:05.160]   18 months into their marriage, Larry and a close friend
[01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:07.160]   were playing some golf when Larry dropped a bomb
[01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:10.160]   by announcing that he was thinking of divorcing Judy.
[01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:13.160]   "She doesn't respect me. Her daughters despise me.
[01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:15.160]   My children hate her.
[01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:20.160]   The only person that seems to remotely like having me around is her son."
[01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:24.160]   "Do you know what is ironic?" he said stoically to his golfing buddy.
[01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:29.160]   "After my first divorce, I was determined to never allow this to happen again.
[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:32.160]   I wanted to have the best Christian home possible.
[01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:36.160]   I really tried, but I was overruled and frustrated at every turn.
[01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:40.160]   I almost can't believe that I'm saying this."
[01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:43.160]   "Do you love Judy?" his friend prodded.
[01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:46.160]   "I don't know. I don't feel anything anymore.
[01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:49.160]   All my emotions are gone. I'm cold and empty inside,
[01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:53.160]   going about my responsibilities every day like a robot.
[01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:56.160]   I know this is not the way that the Christian life is supposed to be.
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:58.160]   Frankly, I've given up hope for this marriage,
[01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:02.160]   and if I read Judy right, she has too.
[01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:08.160]   I've tried everything, but I believe that we'd both be happier living apart.
[01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:11.160]   At least I know her children would be."
[01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:14.160]   "Everything" is a pretty big statement.
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:17.160]   "Have you tried everything?" his friend remarked.
[01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:20.160]   "Have you and Judy tried going to one of the pastors
[01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:23.160]   to get some biblical answers for your problems?"
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:25.160]   "No," he shot back.
[01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:27.160]   "I know what they're going to tell me to do,
[01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:29.160]   pray about it and have devotions with the family.
[01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:33.160]   I did that, and Judy's daughters fought me every step of the way.
[01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:36.160]   It was war every time I tried to be a spiritual leader."
[01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:39.160]   "Hey, give our pastors more credit than that.
[01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:41.160]   There are hard issues here that need to be addressed,
[01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:44.160]   and I think that you need to try to get some good biblical help.
[01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:46.160]   After what happened in your first marriage,
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:49.160]   I'd hate to see you give up so easily."
[01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:53.160]   Larry's friend was right.
[01:12:53.160 --> 01:13:02.160]   So Larry and Judy sit in front of you for their first counseling session.
[01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:05.160]   Tension is thick.
[01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:08.160]   What are you going to do?
[01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:10.160]   [laughs]
[01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:14.160]   Victoria says, "I'm going to defer to Andrew."
[01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:16.160]   All right, let me give you some background.
[01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:18.160]   First of all, when you come upon situations like this,
[01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:21.160]   you've got to understand that one of the top things
[01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:24.160]   that stepfamilies need is hope.
[01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:27.160]   Usually, most of them, when they finally come into counseling,
[01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:30.160]   they are at their wits' end.
[01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:36.160]   In other words, they are hopeless.
[01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:38.160]   The first order of business,
[01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:42.160]   after you have thoroughly listened to the situation
[01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:46.160]   and gathered good data,
[01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:49.160]   is to give this couple hope.
[01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:52.160]   This problem is not bigger than God.
[01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:55.160]   This problem did not catch God by surprise.
[01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:58.160]   We're not open theists.
[01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:01.160]   Neither is the Bible.
[01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:04.160]   This problem is not beyond God's help,
[01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:07.160]   and God has provided concrete answers
[01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:10.160]   for problems like this in His Word,
[01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:12.160]   and they need hope,
[01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:17.160]   and they need it in the first counseling session.
[01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:19.160]   One of the things you need to do
[01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:23.160]   is help them start broadly with broad hope.
[01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:25.160]   There are great passages in the Bible,
[01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:30.160]   like Romans 8, 28, and 29.
[01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:32.160]   "All things work together for good to them
[01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:35.160]   that are called according to His purpose."
[01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:39.160]   1 Corinthians 10 and verse 13.
[01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:42.160]   "There is no temptation taken you except for what is common to man,
[01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:43.160]   and God is faithful.
[01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:46.160]   He will not allow you to be tempted above what you're able,
[01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:54.160]   but with that temptation He will always provide a way of escape."
[01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:58.160]   And then there's Romans chapter 15 and verse 4,
[01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:00.160]   which talks about, through endurance
[01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:02.160]   and the encouragement of the Scriptures,
[01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:06.160]   "We might have hope."
[01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:09.160]   It says there.
[01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:10.160]   Through endurance.
[01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:17.160]   That has to do with persevering in terms of obedience.
[01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:18.160]   And the encouragement,
[01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:23.160]   that comes from the very promises of Scripture.
[01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:25.160]   Verse 4 says, "For whatever is written in earlier times
[01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:26.160]   is written for our instruction,
[01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:27.160]   so that through perseverance
[01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:29.160]   and the encouragement of the Scriptures,
[01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:32.160]   we might have hope."
[01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:34.160]   And then later on in verse 13, He says,
[01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:37.160]   "Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace
[01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:39.160]   and believing so that you will abound in hope
[01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:41.160]   by the power of the Holy Spirit."
[01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:42.160]   Now I realize the context here
[01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:44.160]   is not about blended family strife.
[01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:47.160]   That's not the context.
[01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:51.160]   But certainly He is developing a broad theological principle
[01:15:51.160 --> 01:16:00.160]   that is applicable even to step family problems.
[01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:14.160]   And then, of course, there's 1 Peter chapter 1 and verse 3.
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:17.160]   "Blessed be the God and Father of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:18.160]   who according to His great mercy
[01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:22.160]   has caused us to be born again to a living hope
[01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:26.160]   through the resurrection of Jesus from the dead."
[01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:29.160]   That's a living hope.
[01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:35.160]   That's what we have.
[01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:36.160]   I mean, imagine,
[01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:38.160]   what's the greatest problem that man faces?
[01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:43.160]   I think the answer will be death, the curse of death.
[01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:47.160]   And our God has conquered that in Christ.
[01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:48.160]   That's the biggest mountain out there.
[01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:51.160]   And so if God has conquered that bigger mountain,
[01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:53.160]   then certainly this lesser mountain
[01:16:53.160 --> 01:17:01.160]   of blended family problems can be conquered as well.
[01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:02.160]   Yes?
[01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:20.160]   [indistinct]
[01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:23.160]   Well, usually, the question you're asking me,
[01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:24.160]   how do you give people hope
[01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:26.160]   who are really totally hopeless?
[01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:28.160]   You've got to understand that people like this
[01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:30.160]   are focused entirely on the problem,
[01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:32.160]   and they've been focused on this particular problem
[01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:34.160]   for such a long time
[01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:37.160]   that that's all they see is the problem.
[01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:39.160]   They don't see anything beyond that.
[01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:41.160]   They just see the problem.
[01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:44.160]   And when you're taking them to these broad-based verses,
[01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:46.160]   you're causing them to step back
[01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:48.160]   and see the bigger picture.
[01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:50.160]   When all they see is the problem,
[01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:51.160]   God is not in the picture.
[01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:53.160]   But when they step back and see God operating
[01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:55.160]   through his control and his sovereignty
[01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:57.160]   in the events of their lives,
[01:17:57.160 --> 01:18:00.160]   then all of a sudden hope begins to come back,
[01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:03.160]   that yes, God is still at work here
[01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:06.160]   even though things seem to be so hopeless,
[01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:09.160]   like with Larry and Judy's home.
[01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:10.160]   And he is.
[01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:13.160]   He is very definitely at work here.
[01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:16.160]   Or like I like to say in counseling,
[01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:18.160]   God is up to something.
[01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:22.160]   He's up to something good.
[01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:23.160]   So you're causing them to step back
[01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:25.160]   and take a look at the bigger picture,
[01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:27.160]   not just focusing on their problem.
[01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:29.160]   They're looking at God.
[01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:31.160]   Sometimes I like to say it like this to counselees.
[01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:34.160]   I know this problem looks like a huge mountain in your life,
[01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:36.160]   but I want you to step back and look.
[01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:38.160]   God is standing behind and above this mountain.
[01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:43.160]   He's bigger than this problem.
[01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:47.160]   I want them to have a concept of God's absolute sovereignty
[01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:53.160]   over all these events for their good.
[01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:56.160]   This is what Joseph did, wasn't it, in Genesis 50-20?
[01:18:56.160 --> 01:18:59.160]   You intended all this for evil, Joseph said to his brothers,
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:04.160]   but God has intended it for good,
[01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:07.160]   the saving of many lives.
[01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:11.160]   So Larry and Judy needs to have a faithful biblical counselor
[01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:14.160]   take these verses apart and minister hope
[01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:17.160]   to their despairing hearts.
[01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:20.160]   Now, not only that,
[01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:28.160]   but stepfamilies also need specific hope.
[01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:30.160]   And when I say that, specific hope,
[01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:33.160]   I'm talking about the fact that they need to own
[01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:35.160]   their own personal responsibility
[01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:40.160]   for their attitudes and actions.
[01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:43.160]   And I'm afraid that this is not what contemporary psychology does.
[01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:48.160]   Contemporary psychology always makes you a victim of your problem.
[01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:52.160]   Contemporary psychology does not help people own responsibility
[01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:56.160]   for their own feelings and actions.
[01:19:56.160 --> 01:20:00.160]   Most psychologists, Christians and otherwise,
[01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:03.160]   will label this family dysfunctional.
[01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:06.160]   This is a dysfunctional stepfamily.
[01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:11.160]   Even systems therapy will do the same thing.
[01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:14.160]   Ackerman's whole view on this thing is that
[01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:17.160]   this family is essentially dysfunctional,
[01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:20.160]   which gives the impression that a unique combination of people
[01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:22.160]   in this particular stepfamily,
[01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:26.160]   with their destructive or distinctive personalities,
[01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:29.160]   combined to form an incompatible set of relationships
[01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:32.160]   that is beyond their ability to change.
[01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:36.160]   Since these personalities from contemporary psychology
[01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:43.160]   are fixed and established or ingrained,
[01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:46.160]   it's believed they have to learn to accept the differences
[01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:48.160]   and make the best of them.
[01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:50.160]   So the unique combination of adversarial personalities
[01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:52.160]   are the cause of the problem.
[01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:54.160]   It's sort of like making a family of pit bulls
[01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:56.160]   live in harmony with a family of poodles.
[01:20:56.160 --> 01:21:01.160]   It's not going to be pretty.
[01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:04.160]   So you have to just kind of help them
[01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:07.160]   to accept one another, adjust to one another,
[01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:11.160]   you'll hear them say.
[01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:14.160]   One article from Minarth Meyer Publications says this,
[01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:16.160]   and by the way, this article goes on for several pages
[01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:19.160]   without a single reference to the Bible or Scripture
[01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:22.160]   in counseling "blended families."
[01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:25.160]   It says this, "If the parents do their job
[01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:27.160]   "and face their issues, the family will come through
[01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:29.160]   "the crisis and work to make adjustments."
[01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:31.160]   That's really key.
[01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:33.160]   "Work to make adjustments that they learn
[01:21:33.160 --> 01:21:35.160]   "through counseling must be made.
[01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:38.160]   "These adjustments include negotiation of roles."
[01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:40.160]   Wait a minute.
[01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:42.160]   I thought roles were fixed in Scripture.
[01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:44.160]   Negotiation of roles.
[01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:46.160]   Relationship building.
[01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:48.160]   I don't have a problem with that.
[01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:50.160]   Validation of family rules, traditions, and customs.
[01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:54.160]   I will have a problem with that if those traditional rules
[01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:56.160]   and customs are not biblical.
[01:21:56.160 --> 01:21:59.160]   Validation of the new family unit.
[01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:02.160]   Okay, that's okay with me.
[01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:06.160]   Now, the key where I think, though, in that definition
[01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:08.160]   is the word "adjustment."
[01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:10.160]   Families need to adjust to one another.
[01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:12.160]   Not a single word is given in the article,
[01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:14.160]   the personal responsibility for change when it comes
[01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:17.160]   to interaction with other members of the family.
[01:22:17.160 --> 01:22:19.160]   And you see, what I'm saying is that kind of a treatment
[01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:23.160]   of the problem predicates the peace and harmony of the home
[01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:27.160]   upon everyone making external adjustments,
[01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:30.160]   seeking to change and grow.
[01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:34.160]   And I believe that kind of counsel strips stepfamilies
[01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:36.160]   of genuine hope.
[01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:39.160]   If the family is truly dysfunctional due to unchangeable
[01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:42.160]   personalities, then it's stuck in a hopeless quagmire
[01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:46.160]   of endless adjusting and coping.
[01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:52.160]   That amounts to nothing more than age-old heresy
[01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:54.160]   of asceticism.
[01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:57.160]   It means you just resign yourself to a notion that you
[01:22:57.160 --> 01:23:00.160]   have to suffer through the indignities of the other
[01:23:00.160 --> 01:23:03.160]   members of your stepfamily by practicing personal
[01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:07.160]   self-abasement.
[01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:09.160]   That kind of attitude's not biblical at all.
[01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:12.160]   Colossians 2:23 says, "These things are matters which have
[01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:14.160]   to be sure the appearance of wisdom and self-made religion
[01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:17.160]   and self-abasement and severe treatment of the body,
[01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:20.160]   but they are of no value against fleshly indulgences."
[01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:23.160]   In other words, all the self-abasement, self-restraint
[01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:27.160]   is externalism that will never bring the passions of the flesh
[01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:30.160]   under control, the desires of the heart.
[01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:33.160]   They'll be of no value against fleshly indulgences.
[01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:39.160]   There's no complete change that really needs to be there
[01:23:39.160 --> 01:23:42.160]   that starts in the heart.
[01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:44.160]   If, however, the members of the family, beginning with Larry
[01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:48.160]   and Judy, are willing and convinced that they can change
[01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:51.160]   and grow from the heart, then hope returns, a sense of
[01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:55.160]   expectation and re-energized commitment returns.
[01:23:55.160 --> 01:23:59.160]   By the end of your first session in counseling Larry and Judy,
[01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:03.160]   they should be ready to re-engage this battle and begin
[01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:09.160]   to make changes in their own personal lives as individuals
[01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:13.160]   that desperately need to be made.
[01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:16.160]   In counseling, you have to win that battle up front.
[01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:22.160]   It's a fleshly battle, and the battle front is in the heart.
[01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:29.160]   You have to view your role as that of an ideological warrior.
[01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:35.160]   He talks about speculations here, that which is lifted up,
[01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:36.160]   higher exalted.
[01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:39.160]   It has to do with high-sounding ideas that are not based upon
[01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:43.160]   truth but more related to man's ideas about life rather than
[01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:45.160]   God's ideas.
[01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:50.160]   And every lofty thing, to lift oneself up, it means to exalt
[01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:55.160]   oneself, one's own ideas or something that belongs to you.
[01:24:55.160 --> 01:24:58.160]   For our purposes, we could say that many step-parents exalt
[01:24:58.160 --> 01:25:01.160]   their biological children or family to a higher plane of
[01:25:01.160 --> 01:25:08.160]   priority than God gives them.
[01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:12.160]   In other words, I realize that 2 Corinthians 10, again, is not
[01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:19.160]   within context of dealing with step-family strife either, but
[01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:22.160]   there is a theological principle that is related here, and that
[01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:26.160]   is that we have a tendency in dealing with stress and
[01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:33.160]   circumstances of life, which 2 Corinthians 10 is about, to
[01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:37.160]   elevate human ideas and human ways of thinking above God's
[01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:40.160]   ideas and God's way of viewing those things.
[01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:43.160]   And you're going to find step-families to do the same
[01:25:43.160 --> 01:25:44.160]   thing.
[01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:48.160]   They will elevate their ideas on how to deal with this
[01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:53.160]   particular problem above God's ideas.
[01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:57.160]   And I'll give you some examples of this.
[01:25:57.160 --> 01:26:00.160]   So there's a sense in which, as a counselor, you are an
[01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:06.160]   ideological warrior.
[01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:09.160]   Like the Apostle Paul who sees himself as going to war in his
[01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:13.160]   ministry of the word to bring such a foreign enemy of thought
[01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:18.160]   into captivity and to make it obedient to Christ in verse 5.
[01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:21.160]   One of the first battle fronts in this war is that most
[01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:27.160]   biological parents in step-family relationships operate
[01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:32.160]   with a low view of marriage.
[01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:33.160]   They don't think so.
[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:36.160]   In fact, if you confront them, they'll never admit this, but
[01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:43.160]   step-parents have to be taught a high view of marriage.
[01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:45.160]   So one stronghold to be assaulted by the counselor is
[01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:48.160]   this false doctrine held by many step-parents, whether by
[01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:52.160]   statement or by practice, they advance the notion here, "My
[01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:55.160]   children come first."
[01:26:55.160 --> 01:26:58.160]   That reveals a low view of marriage, high view of kids,
[01:26:58.160 --> 01:27:02.160]   low view of marriage.
[01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:04.160]   Another way to say this, sometimes you'll hear people
[01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:10.160]   say, "Blood is thicker than water."
[01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:15.160]   Or there was a national campaign a few years back that
[01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:20.160]   was entitled, "Children First."
[01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:23.160]   And a lot of step-family problems are rooted in this
[01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:28.160]   kind of thinking, this kind of ideology, and it prevails, and
[01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:31.160]   it's very, very strong.
[01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:34.160]   And they don't even realize that it's a problem because
[01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:37.160]   like fish in water, fish don't know they're in water because
[01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:39.160]   they're used to water all the time.
[01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:41.160]   Well, they live in this culture and they don't even realize
[01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:44.160]   that this is a problem in terms of their thinking.
[01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:47.160]   They don't even understand it.
[01:27:47.160 --> 01:27:49.160]   So you've got to engage this wrong notion with the
[01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:50.160]   Scripture.
[01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:53.160]   The Bible teaches us from the beginning that marriage takes
[01:27:53.160 --> 01:27:56.160]   precedence over children.
[01:27:56.160 --> 01:27:59.160]   Wow, that's really critical.
[01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:00.160]   Where do we get that?
[01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:03.160]   Well, you get that back in Genesis 2 and verse 24 from the
[01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:06.160]   very beginning in the first relationship.
[01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:08.160]   We looked at this earlier.
[01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:10.160]   "For this reason, a man shall leave his father and mother
[01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:13.160]   and be united to his wife, and they shall become one flesh."
[01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:18.160]   So from the very beginning, even before Adam and Eve were
[01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:23.160]   parents, God is admonishing them that it's the role and
[01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:26.160]   responsibility of children to leave their parents and to
[01:28:26.160 --> 01:28:28.160]   cling to their spouse.
[01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:32.160]   So the parent-child relationship is a temporary one.
[01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:38.160]   The husband-wife relationship is a permanent one.
[01:28:38.160 --> 01:28:46.160]   It's a permanent one.
[01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:49.160]   Reuben's going to be asking his girlfriend to make a
[01:28:49.160 --> 01:28:55.160]   permanent commitment tonight, a break, a change.
[01:28:55.160 --> 01:29:00.160]   All right, that's a pretty serious commitment.
[01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:08.160]   So from the beginning, the Bible teaches that marriage
[01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:11.160]   takes precedence here.
[01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:13.160]   But I've got to warn you that most of them believe even
[01:29:13.160 --> 01:29:15.160]   though their marriage is threatened, they still have a
[01:29:15.160 --> 01:29:17.160]   high view of marriage.
[01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:20.160]   I've never found a situation in counseling this kind of
[01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:24.160]   problem where their concept of marriage was too high.
[01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:26.160]   I've never seen that.
[01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:28.160]   In fact, just the opposite.
[01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:32.160]   So let me make eight observations here about this to
[01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:35.160]   help you in dealing with stepfamilies.
[01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:39.160]   Number one, husband-and-wife relationship is intended by
[01:29:39.160 --> 01:29:43.160]   God to be the permanent relationship, and just because
[01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:46.160]   this is your second marriage does not make it any less of a
[01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:51.160]   marriage in God's eyes.
[01:29:51.160 --> 01:29:57.160]   The husband-wife relationship is intended to be a permanent
[01:29:57.160 --> 01:30:02.160]   relationship.
[01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:05.160]   "For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother,"
[01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:08.160]   Genesis 2:24.
[01:30:08.160 --> 01:30:14.160]   And that's to be for good, for life.
[01:30:14.160 --> 01:30:17.160]   You remember when God gave this admonition in Genesis 2:24,
[01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:20.160]   they were going to live forever.
[01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:26.160]   So this was a forever type of commitment originally.
[01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:32.160]   Now because of sin and now death reigning, it's for life as
[01:30:32.160 --> 01:30:36.160]   we know it.
[01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:38.160]   So the husband-wife relationship, even though this
[01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:46.160]   is the second marriage, is always to take priority.
[01:30:46.160 --> 01:30:49.160]   Secondly, the parent-child relationship is intended by
[01:30:49.160 --> 01:30:54.160]   God to be temporary relationship.
[01:30:54.160 --> 01:30:56.160]   Now here's what often happens.
[01:30:56.160 --> 01:31:00.160]   Because the mother or the father have a longer standing,
[01:31:00.160 --> 01:31:04.160]   oftentimes years of relationship with their children prior to
[01:31:04.160 --> 01:31:09.160]   this second spouse coming into their life, their tendency is
[01:31:09.160 --> 01:31:13.160]   to always gravitate towards the children and prefer their
[01:31:13.160 --> 01:31:15.160]   children over their spouse.
[01:31:15.160 --> 01:31:18.160]   That's always the tendency because there's already a
[01:31:18.160 --> 01:31:20.160]   history there.
[01:31:20.160 --> 01:31:23.160]   You already have a history of relationship.
[01:31:23.160 --> 01:31:26.160]   This other person, no matter how much initially they say
[01:31:26.160 --> 01:31:29.160]   that they love that other person, is still new to them
[01:31:29.160 --> 01:31:31.160]   comparatively.
[01:31:31.160 --> 01:31:33.160]   They haven't had the years of relationship.
[01:31:33.160 --> 01:31:36.160]   They haven't gone through any struggles with this person.
[01:31:36.160 --> 01:31:38.160]   And so there's not the kind of history that you have with
[01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:40.160]   your children.
[01:31:40.160 --> 01:31:43.160]   Not to mention the fact you're biologically related to your
[01:31:43.160 --> 01:31:44.160]   children.
[01:31:44.160 --> 01:31:50.160]   You're not biologically related to your spouse.
[01:31:50.160 --> 01:31:54.160]   So somehow in human thinking, that makes that a more
[01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:57.160]   permanent bond.
[01:31:57.160 --> 01:32:02.160]   But in God's thinking, that relationship with the child is
[01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:10.160]   not as permanent as the relationship to the spouse.
[01:32:10.160 --> 01:32:14.160]   And in fact, we have a biblical responsibility to make our
[01:32:14.160 --> 01:32:17.160]   relationship to our spouse permanent and to rear our
[01:32:17.160 --> 01:32:21.160]   children in such a way as to leave the home, not stay in
[01:32:21.160 --> 01:32:23.160]   the home.
[01:32:23.160 --> 01:32:27.160]   And we help them to do that when we make our priority to
[01:32:27.160 --> 01:32:31.160]   our spouse number one.
[01:32:31.160 --> 01:32:34.160]   So the parent-child relationship is intended by God to be a
[01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:38.160]   temporary relationship.
[01:32:38.160 --> 01:32:43.160]   Thirdly, your biological children, and in this
[01:32:43.160 --> 01:32:48.160]   particular case, stepchildren, must be reared to leave the
[01:32:48.160 --> 01:32:54.160]   home, not stay in the home.
[01:32:54.160 --> 01:32:57.160]   They must be reared to leave the home.
[01:32:57.160 --> 01:33:02.160]   Most stepparents, however, treat their children as if their
[01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:05.160]   children are always going to be a part of that home.
[01:33:05.160 --> 01:33:08.160]   They've already lost their spouse through death or
[01:33:08.160 --> 01:33:11.160]   divorce, and that has hurt them a lot.
[01:33:11.160 --> 01:33:14.160]   So they're going to hold on to their children even more
[01:33:14.160 --> 01:33:20.160]   tenaciously than a normal home, intact home would, or normal
[01:33:20.160 --> 01:33:22.160]   parents would.
[01:33:22.160 --> 01:33:25.160]   So this is very, very difficult.
[01:33:25.160 --> 01:33:31.160]   After losing a spouse by death or divorce, to turn around and
[01:33:31.160 --> 01:33:35.160]   to let go of your kids, which is the last remnants of that
[01:33:35.160 --> 01:33:42.160]   original home, is very, very tough for a stepparent to do.
[01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:49.160]   Not impossible, but it's going to be tough.
[01:33:49.160 --> 01:33:51.160]   Yet I want you to understand that this is exactly what the
[01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:56.160]   children need to see, which brings us to number four.
[01:33:56.160 --> 01:34:00.160]   Your example of setting their stepfather or stepmother ahead
[01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:04.160]   of them as children is the model that they need to see for
[01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:07.160]   their own future marriage.
[01:34:07.160 --> 01:34:10.160]   We see this in creation in Genesis 2, verse 18, through
[01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:12.160]   chapter 4 and verse 1.
[01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:14.160]   We see it in Paul's description of the Christian home in
[01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:18.160]   Ephesians 5, verse 22 through 6, 5.
[01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:21.160]   We see it in the qualification of elders in 1 Timothy 3.
[01:34:21.160 --> 01:34:25.160]   The priority is always given to the husband and wife
[01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:27.160]   relationship first.
[01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:34.160]   The children are always second.
[01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:37.160]   Now, I see theological significance there, much the
[01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:40.160]   same way that the Apostle Paul saw theological significance
[01:34:40.160 --> 01:34:46.160]   in the order of creation when he was talking about women who
[01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:52.160]   need to remain silent in church in 1 Timothy 2.
[01:34:52.160 --> 01:34:55.160]   And he says in verse 13, "For it was Adam who was first
[01:34:55.160 --> 01:34:57.160]   created and then Eve."
[01:34:57.160 --> 01:35:00.160]   So the Apostle Paul saw theological significance in the
[01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:04.160]   order of creation, creating Adam first and then Eve.
[01:35:04.160 --> 01:35:09.160]   I see theological significance in the order of all of these
[01:35:09.160 --> 01:35:13.160]   passages preferring the husband and wife relationship over the
[01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:15.160]   parent-child relationship.
[01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:19.160]   So there is, I believe, theological significance in that
[01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:23.160]   alone.
[01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:26.160]   And it's something that these stepchildren and your
[01:35:26.160 --> 01:35:29.160]   biological children need to see.
[01:35:29.160 --> 01:35:35.160]   They need to see their dad putting their stepmother first.
[01:35:35.160 --> 01:35:41.160]   They need to see their mother putting their stepfather first
[01:35:41.160 --> 01:35:44.160]   because that becomes the model that they need to carry into
[01:35:44.160 --> 01:35:47.160]   their future relationship and permanent relationship in the
[01:35:47.160 --> 01:35:51.160]   home.
[01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:54.160]   Well, as we said, there's that old saying, "Blood is thicker
[01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:58.160]   than water," but really from a biblical perspective, marriage
[01:35:58.160 --> 01:36:01.160]   is thicker than blood.
[01:36:01.160 --> 01:36:05.160]   You may be blood-related to your children, but your
[01:36:05.160 --> 01:36:10.160]   commitment to them is temporary.
[01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:13.160]   However, even though you are not blood-related to your spouse,
[01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:25.160]   your commitment to them is for a lifetime.
[01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:32.160]   And this comes in the big and the small choices of life, how
[01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:38.160]   you treat your wife or your husband that is your children's
[01:36:38.160 --> 01:36:48.160]   step-parent in preferring them, honoring them, esteeming them,
[01:36:48.160 --> 01:36:54.160]   talking about them, in doing loving things for them, in
[01:36:54.160 --> 01:36:58.160]   caring for them has to be seen by the children and has to be
[01:36:58.160 --> 01:37:04.160]   seen by your spouse.
[01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:08.160]   This is where the belief that marriage is thicker than blood
[01:37:08.160 --> 01:37:14.160]   becomes so important here.
[01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:20.160]   Number six, the powerful and very natural parental compulsion
[01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:23.160]   to love their children must be surrendered to the higher
[01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:34.160]   priority of being a godly mate and loving spouse.
[01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:38.160]   It's going to be very easy for them to follow their flesh on
[01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:42.160]   this, and their flesh will say, "Love your children first,"
[01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:45.160]   because everything in their natural tendencies will tell
[01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:47.160]   them to do that.
[01:37:47.160 --> 01:37:52.160]   Love your children first.
[01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:54.160]   But it's like anything else in life.
[01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:57.160]   Are we going to let our passions rule us, or our natural
[01:37:57.160 --> 01:38:00.160]   desires will rule us, or are we going to allow what God says
[01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:02.160]   rule us?
[01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:04.160]   It's like everything else in life.
[01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:11.160]   And it's important for your counselee to understand that.
[01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:14.160]   Sometimes I'll actually have them make a list of specific
[01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:18.160]   ways that they can show their children and their stepchildren
[01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:22.160]   that they love their father or mother.
[01:38:22.160 --> 01:38:24.160]   And how are you going to do that?
[01:38:24.160 --> 01:38:25.160]   How are you going to demonstrate it?
[01:38:25.160 --> 01:38:27.160]   In fact, when they really start doing this and start doing this
[01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:30.160]   seriously, if these stepchildren are really observant,
[01:38:30.160 --> 01:38:33.160]   they're not going to like it at all because they realize they're
[01:38:33.160 --> 01:38:37.160]   losing status with their biological parent.
[01:38:37.160 --> 01:38:38.160]   And they get angry.
[01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:40.160]   They get upset.
[01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:42.160]   They start causing more problems.
[01:38:42.160 --> 01:38:47.160]   And you have to prepare these parents on how to deal with
[01:38:47.160 --> 01:38:51.160]   those problems when they start to come up.
[01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:55.160]   But you cannot give in to these natural parental compulsions to
[01:38:55.160 --> 01:38:58.160]   love your children more than your spouse.
[01:38:58.160 --> 01:39:03.160]   You'll get yourself into trouble.
[01:39:03.160 --> 01:39:09.160]   Number seven, not only that, but a child-centered home,
[01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:11.160]   whether it is a first or second marriage,
[01:39:11.160 --> 01:39:14.160]   will always experience trouble because children will eventually
[01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:16.160]   grow up and leave.
[01:39:16.160 --> 01:39:19.160]   You can't stop that.
[01:39:19.160 --> 01:39:22.160]   That leaves you as a couple with a relationship in shambles.
[01:39:22.160 --> 01:39:27.160]   Little or no investment or time or energy has been given to it
[01:39:27.160 --> 01:39:33.160]   over the years.
[01:39:33.160 --> 01:39:38.160]   And we talked about this earlier in our class about how when you
[01:39:38.160 --> 01:39:42.160]   have a husband and wife who make their children the center of the
[01:39:42.160 --> 01:39:46.160]   home, then there have been many marriages who have existed for
[01:39:46.160 --> 01:39:49.160]   20, 25 years, who even call themselves Christian marriage.
[01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:51.160]   And once the children grew up and left the home,
[01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:53.160]   there was no reason for the husband and wife to be together.
[01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:55.160]   And to the shock of everybody in the church,
[01:39:55.160 --> 01:39:56.160]   this couple's getting a divorce.
[01:39:56.160 --> 01:39:58.160]   And they say, I don't understand it.
[01:39:58.160 --> 01:40:01.160]   I mean, we thought that they had a happy Christian home for
[01:40:01.160 --> 01:40:02.160]   years.
[01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:04.160]   But the problem is they made their children the center of the
[01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:05.160]   home.
[01:40:05.160 --> 01:40:06.160]   And once you move that center out,
[01:40:06.160 --> 01:40:08.160]   there's no reason for mom and dad to be together.
[01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:10.160]   That's never to be the case.
[01:40:10.160 --> 01:40:12.160]   The husband and wife relationship is always the center of the
[01:40:12.160 --> 01:40:13.160]   home.
[01:40:13.160 --> 01:40:15.160]   The children revolve around that.
[01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:17.160]   And if the children grow up and leave,
[01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:23.160]   you still have an intact home.
[01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:32.160]   Then number eight, the fleshly and sinful passions and desires
[01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:34.160]   of your biological children.
[01:40:34.160 --> 01:40:36.160]   Well, because Proverbs 22, 15 says,
[01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:39.160]   "Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child."
[01:40:39.160 --> 01:40:43.160]   Will always pit you as a biological parent against their
[01:40:43.160 --> 01:40:47.160]   step-parent, your spouse, if you allow your home to be
[01:40:47.160 --> 01:40:50.160]   child-centered.
[01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:54.160]   They will naturally, the children will naturally work
[01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:57.160]   that against your marriage.
[01:40:57.160 --> 01:41:00.160]   They will prey on your parental affections and use them to
[01:41:00.160 --> 01:41:03.160]   drive a wedge between you and your spouse for their own
[01:41:03.160 --> 01:41:05.160]   self-centered purposes.
[01:41:05.160 --> 01:41:07.160]   And when you allow yourself to be manipulated,
[01:41:07.160 --> 01:41:10.160]   you are pandering their sinful nature.
[01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:13.160]   And in this way, you're hurting both your marriage and your
[01:41:13.160 --> 01:41:19.160]   children.
[01:41:19.160 --> 01:41:22.160]   This is why I say the contemporary approach in
[01:41:22.160 --> 01:41:25.160]   psychology, if you read the step-family,
[01:41:25.160 --> 01:41:27.160]   blended-family materials that are out there,
[01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:31.160]   the contemporary approach in psychology today is undermining
[01:41:31.160 --> 01:41:37.160]   the step-family as a couple because they're making them
[01:41:37.160 --> 01:41:40.160]   victim of dysfunctional elements,
[01:41:40.160 --> 01:41:43.160]   relationships, personalities that seem to be fixed.
[01:41:43.160 --> 01:41:46.160]   They're making them victims of what's going on and just
[01:41:46.160 --> 01:41:49.160]   learning adjustment and coping mechanisms on how to deal with
[01:41:49.160 --> 01:41:50.160]   people.
[01:41:50.160 --> 01:41:53.160]   I hate those words, adjustment and coping.
[01:41:53.160 --> 01:41:57.160]   It's like I've got to adjust and cope with you, all right?
[01:41:57.160 --> 01:41:58.160]   That means put up with you.
[01:41:58.160 --> 01:42:00.160]   But in my heart, I really don't want to do that.
[01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:01.160]   That's terrible.
[01:42:01.160 --> 01:42:05.160]   That's just turning everybody in the home into Pharisees.
[01:42:05.160 --> 01:42:08.160]   No, we're not--the Bible's not teaching people to adjust and
[01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:10.160]   cope with one another.
[01:42:10.160 --> 01:42:13.160]   The Bible is teaching them how to be godly with one another,
[01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:15.160]   how to be Christ-like with one another,
[01:42:15.160 --> 01:42:18.160]   how to assume biblical roles and be content in those biblical
[01:42:18.160 --> 01:42:21.160]   roles, how to genuinely love one another,
[01:42:21.160 --> 01:42:24.160]   even if that other person happens to be,
[01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:29.160]   like Matthew 5, 43 through 48, your enemy.
[01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:33.160]   Even that's the case.
[01:42:33.160 --> 01:42:35.160]   So instead of being a dysfunctional home,
[01:42:35.160 --> 01:42:38.160]   it's a sinful home where people are allowing their sinful
[01:42:38.160 --> 01:42:41.160]   passions to rule.
[01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:46.160]   In this case, the kids don't want anybody from outside their
[01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:51.160]   immediate biological relatedness to their parent to interrupt
[01:42:51.160 --> 01:42:55.160]   what they've got going on.
[01:42:55.160 --> 01:42:59.160]   And the parent wants to favor their biological child because
[01:42:59.160 --> 01:43:03.160]   their child's already suffered enough through death or divorce.
[01:43:03.160 --> 01:43:06.160]   So sinful passions tend to rule rather than God's priorities
[01:43:06.160 --> 01:43:10.160]   ruling.
[01:43:10.160 --> 01:43:12.160]   So we would say something like this.
[01:43:12.160 --> 01:43:15.160]   The genuine Christian home, remember this,
[01:43:15.160 --> 01:43:19.160]   the genuine Christian home rejects the notion,
[01:43:19.160 --> 01:43:25.160]   "My children come first."
[01:43:25.160 --> 01:43:30.160]   God always comes first.
[01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:37.160]   Before the children, the spouse comes first.
[01:43:37.160 --> 01:43:45.160]   Your spouse has to be your first human priority.
[01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:48.160]   Now like I said at the beginning of this particular section,
[01:43:48.160 --> 01:43:54.160]   I wish we had lots more time in our particular class to work on
[01:43:54.160 --> 01:44:00.160]   this issue because there are so many little side tributaries
[01:44:00.160 --> 01:44:03.160]   that we could go down literally and pursue from a biblical
[01:44:03.160 --> 01:44:06.160]   standpoint that blended families get into.
[01:44:06.160 --> 01:44:08.160]   But I wanted to give you, in a sense,
[01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:13.160]   a basic frame of work from which to counsel people.
[01:44:13.160 --> 01:44:15.160]   And hopefully you can build upon that with your own counseling
[01:44:15.160 --> 01:44:18.160]   ministry.
[01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:19.160]   Thank you.
[01:44:19.160 --> 01:44:20.160]   [end]
[01:44:20.160 --> 01:44:21.160]   [end]
