[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.960]   Well, how often should I question my salvation?
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.320]   That is a question we get often.
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.440]   It's a big one, and today it comes from a woman who listens to the podcast named Kinsey.
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.940]   "Hello Pastor Jon, and thank you for your ministry over the years.
[00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.080]   My question has to do with whether or not we should regularly question our salvation.
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.480]   My husband and I were discussing this the other day, and we fell on opposite sides.
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.360]   One saying it's good to examine ourselves often in order to determine whether or not
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.400]   we are saved, the other saying it's more beneficial to regularly evaluate our faithfulness and
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.600]   fruitfulness rather than questioning salvation itself.
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.280]   We studied together 2 Corinthians 13 verse 5.
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.260]   Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith.
[00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.260]   Test yourselves."
[00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.480]   But Pastor Jon, what do you think?
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.520]   Should professing Christians question their own salvation, and how often?
[00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.720]   I want to suggest that we distinguish between testing ourselves to see if we are in the
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:10.800]   faith on the one hand, and living so as to confirm that we are in the faith on the other
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.000]   hand.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:20.240]   I think there is a psychological difference and a strategic difference, strategy difference,
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.240]   between these two.
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:29.160]   So let me give two texts, one for each of these strategies, and then draw out some distinctions
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.680]   that might help.
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:39.560]   Kenzie is asking specifically about 2 Corinthians 13 verse 5, "Examine yourselves to see whether
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.520]   you are in the faith."
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.440]   That's what she means by testing your salvation or questioning your salvation.
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:52.960]   Test yourselves, or do you not realize this about yourselves that Christ is in you?
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:59.800]   So he's very hopeful for the Corinthians, but there are some he's not sure of.
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.400]   Unless you indeed fail to meet the test.
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:10.580]   And the other text is 2 Peter 1.10, "Therefore, brothers, be all the more diligent to confirm
[00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.520]   your calling and election," or you could say salvation.
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:20.740]   "For if you practice these qualities, you will never fall."
[00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:27.560]   And I'm suggesting that there's a difference between the urgency of the self-test in 2
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:36.640]   Corinthians 13.5 and the ongoing ordinary life of confirmation that we really are among
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:44.040]   the elect, really have been effectually called, that is, really have been brought to saving
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.040]   faith.
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:51.520]   In a sense, the bottom line in both cases is, show that you're a real Christian, born
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.620]   again, justified, on your way to heaven.
[00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:02.520]   But there's a difference between being told, "Test yourself to see if you're saved," and
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.920]   being told, "Live so as to confirm your election."
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:15.120]   One of the reasons I think there's a significant difference here is because in the context
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:22.400]   of 2 Corinthians, there is some real conflict between Paul and some people at Corinth who
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.160]   have given significant evidence that they may not be true Christians.
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:40.480]   For example, just a few verses before 13.5, namely in 12.21, Paul says, "I fear that when
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:47.640]   I come again I may have to mourn over many of those who sinned earlier and have not repented
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.600]   of the impurity, sexual immorality, and sensuality that they have practiced."
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:59.620]   In other words, here are people who have not repented of their sins and so are on the brink
[00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.820]   of being excommunicated.
[00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:09.480]   And then just a few verses later, 13.3, Paul says, "You seek proof that Christ is speaking
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.480]   in me?"
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:16.940]   Now, that word "proof" there is the same word he uses two verses later in verse 5, only
[00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:24.720]   here he says they're putting him to the test to prove that he's real in his speaking.
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:30.400]   So when he gets to verse 5, he says, "Actually, folks, you should be testing yourselves, you
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.680]   unrepentant folks, you should be testing yourselves to see if you are in the faith."
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:42.680]   So I'm inclined to think that what brought Paul to say this with as much urgency as he
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:48.680]   did is that he's been dealing with an unrepentant crowd who claim to be Christians, but they're
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.720]   actually totally out of character.
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:58.680]   They're living in sin, they're not repenting, while they're claiming to be Christians.
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:06.200]   So I'm inferring from this and the other ways that Paul deals with Christians that the command
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:13.600]   "test yourself to see if you are in the faith" is not a command that he ordinarily gives
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:20.920]   as a regular part of a Christian life, or that we should regularly, like part of our
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:28.120]   morning devotion, say, do it, and the way he means it there in verse 5 of 2 Corinthians
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.120]   13.
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:35.760]   This is a command that is especially appropriate when somebody is living a life that is out
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.840]   of step with their profession of faith and gives significant evidence that they may not
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.700]   be real Christians.
[00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:51.040]   So the question, "How often should we do this?" seems to imply it should be an ordinarily
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:56.840]   daily kind of, or maybe weekly part of the Christian walk, when in fact, I don't think
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:57.840]   that.
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:03.880]   I think Paul would say this kind of test is something extraordinary and to be done at
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:09.960]   critical points in your life when you have drifted away from walking in step with the
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:18.040]   Spirit and have been called out, probably by somebody or maybe by your own conscience,
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.080]   are you a real Christian?
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:26.920]   Now that brings me to 2 Peter 1.10, which I think does describe the more regular way
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:33.060]   to think about the relationship between our faith and the evidence of our life that we
[00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.240]   are truly Christians.
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:41.280]   So Peter says, "Therefore, brothers, be all the more diligent to confirm," and that's
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:47.520]   just a standard procedure, "be all the more diligent to confirm your calling and your
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:51.480]   election, for if you practice these qualities, you'll never fall."
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:58.160]   And by "these qualities," he's referring back to verses 5 to 8, "In faith seek to have
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:03.200]   virtue, in virtue knowledge, in knowledge self-control, in self-control endurance, in
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:08.960]   endurance godliness, in godliness brotherly affection, in brotherly affection love."
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:16.200]   In other words, living this way is how you confirm your calling and election.
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:22.480]   So I don't think Peter is saying, now in this critical moment of serious failure, as in
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:26.880]   2 Corinthians, "Seek to confirm your calling and your election."
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.120]   I don't think he means that.
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:36.580]   I think he means, "Live your life in such a way that it ordinarily confirms your calling
[00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:38.580]   and your election.
[00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:43.080]   Take your daily stand on your justification by faith.
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:52.880]   Be confident that on the basis of Christ alone, God counts you righteous, and then walk in
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:08:00.200]   happy, obedient faith, and virtue, and knowledge, and self-control, and godliness, and brotherly
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:03.280]   affection, and love for the glory of Christ."
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:10.000]   And if the question arises in your heart, "But might I not deceive myself and think
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.720]   I'm a Christian when I'm not?"
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:15.880]   Here's what the writer of Hebrews says about that.
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:20.840]   "Take care, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief leading you
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.440]   to fall away from the living God."
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:24.440]   What's the solution?
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:31.280]   "Exhort one another every day, as long as it is called today, that none of you may be
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.560]   hardened by the deceitfulness of sin."
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:38.200]   So that's his answer to the question, "Well, I might be deceived."
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.780]   No.
[00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:45.300]   In fellowship with other people, encouraging us with the promises of God, giving us the
[00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:51.720]   warnings of God, and keeping their eyes on our life and faith, that's the prescribed
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:55.560]   way by which we avoid being self-deceived.
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:57.600]   So bottom line answer.
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:05.480]   Do the serious critical test of 2 Corinthians 13:5 when someone warns you that no longer
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:12.600]   does your life appear to be confirming your Christian claim.
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:17.760]   This should set off alarm bells in you, and you might be in serious trouble.
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:23.280]   So do that kind of serious self-analysis, which can be very frightening, very difficult,
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.600]   but very, very important.
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:34.540]   But always, day by day, have the seriousness to pursue a life of holiness that confirms
[00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:40.680]   your calling and your election, and live in fellowship with those who will encourage you
[00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.680]   in this day by day.
[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:43.680]   Excellent.
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:44.680]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:45.680]   And thank you for listening to the podcast.
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.520]   Kenzie, thank you for the wonderful and important question.

[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.440]   Well we are going to break for the weekend and return next week with a question from
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:11.320]   a discouraged pastor who thinks his church should be further along in holiness.
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:14.760]   How does he and how do we all bear with immature Christians?
[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:16.920]   It's a really great question.
[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:18.940]   We will hear from Pastor John on Monday.
[00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:19.940]   I'm Tony Reinke.
[00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:20.940]   Thanks for listening to the podcast.
[00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:22.520]   Have a great weekend.
