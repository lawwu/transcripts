[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.420]   Pick up your phone, dipshit.
[00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.000]   Hello?
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.020]   Sax.
[00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.640]   Yeah, I'll be ready in like two minutes, okay?
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:09.980]   I'm sorry.
[00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:10.840]   Let's go.
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.300]   Splash some water on your face.
[00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.760]   Take a couple of whatever you need.
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.980]   Some *** and ***.
[00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:16.640]   Let's go.
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:17.300]   We're waiting.
[00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.580]   Okay.
[00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:18.720]   I'll be there in two minutes.
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:18.940]   Okay.
[00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:19.520]   Okay, hurry up.
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.860]   It's your chance to get max airtime.
[00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.340]   Are we really going to record that, Freeberg?
[00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.980]   Listen, Freeberg's out.
[00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.220]   That means you're going to get, by default, 33.3% of airtime.
[00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.360]   It's going to be your biggest week ever.
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.180]   I'm coming, I'm coming.
[00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.100]   Let your winners ride.
[00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.980]   Rain Man, David Sass.
[00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.700]   We open sourced it to the fans, and they've just gone crazy with it.
[00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.340]   Love you guys.
[00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.540]   Nice.
[00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.040]   Queen of Kinwa.
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.240]   Hey, everybody.
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.660]   Hey, everybody.
[00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.600]   Welcome to another episode of the All In Podcast.
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.800]   With us today, the dictator himself, Chamath Palihapiti,
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.780]   and the Rain Man.
[00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.100]   David Sacks.
[00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.300]   I'm J. Cal.
[00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.480]   And the Queen of Kinwa.
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.980]   Quit the show.
[00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:05.820]   Where is the Queen?
[00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.800]   He quit the show, I think.
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:08.400]   I think he quit.
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.440]   So we're looking for a science person.
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:16.440]   If you know anybody, email scienceguy@theallinpodcast.com if you want to
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.040]   apply for the science position here.
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.480]   No, he couldn't make it.
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.100]   He was-
[00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.120]   Freeberg's moving.
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.020]   He's moving.
[00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.800]   He's moving.
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:28.500]   I guess we can say that without invading his privacy, but he's not going to be able to.
[00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.740]   we do a show anyway, because there's so much going on. And I
[00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.920]   think we should start with this. Do we want to start with the
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.740]   COVID stuff again for the third episode in a row? And then back
[00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:39.820]   into COVID? Oh,
[00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.420]   fuck COVID. And then we should just do COVID quickly, because I
[00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.200]   think, you know, as much as the audience complained about it, we
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.000]   got a lot of comments saying, Why are you talking about COVID
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   so much, we were ahead of the curve, and predicting the sole
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.880]   new delta wave. You know, we told people I was coming, I
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.160]   think it was a useful service. So people might not want to hear
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.140]   it. But it was, I think, I would say we're probably two weeks
[00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.880]   ahead of the
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.620]   I think that we've gotten a couple things actually right. The
[00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.920]   a couple weeks ahead of other people. Yeah. So
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.980]   yeah, I mean, it was pretty obvious that this was going to
[00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:17.320]   race through the places that had low vaccination. And having the
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:23.680]   breakthrough cases is I don't think anybody anticipated that.
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.080]   And the thing we did it to over the last week on
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.360]   Twitter, I'm seeing this big debate on whether vaccinated
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.840]   people can spread the Delta variant. And I'm like, guys,
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.320]   didn't you see the show two weeks ago, we covered this. Yeah,
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.600]   I got it. I was vaccinated. I got it from someone who was
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.700]   vaccinated. This is no, you know, Delta variant has slipped
[00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.620]   the vaccine. It still prevents the most serious cases.
[00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.840]   Generally speaking, we need to see it as a spectrum of
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.800]   protection, rather than completely binary. But yeah,
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.740]   absolutely. You can get it and pass it on if you're vaccinated.
[00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:55.040]   Like we know that and we said we told the audience that's the way we're going to do it.
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.040]   But yeah, absolutely. You can get it and pass it on if you're vaccinated. Like we know that and we said we told the audience that's the way we're going to do it.
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.800]   Like we know that and we said we told the audience that three weeks ago.
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.000]   The other thing we predicted was, you know, that this is going
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.980]   to be incredibly disruptive, and it's going to create another
[00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.180]   debate of lock and potential lockdowns and mask mandates. And
[00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.000]   most of all, we discussed and we you know, we had, I think, a
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.140]   pretty vibrant debate between all of us about under what
[00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.660]   circumstances does your decision to not get vaccinated impact
[00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.000]   everybody else vis a vis the petri dish of the next variant of the Delta variant.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   So we're going to have to wait and see what happens. But I'm
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   going to have to wait and see what happens. But I'm
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   going to have to wait and see what happens. But I'm
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   going to have to wait and see what happens. But I'm
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   going to have to wait and see what happens. But I'm
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   going to have to wait and see what happens. But I'm
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.020]   going to have to wait and see what happens. But I'm going to
[00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:27.140]   the petri dish of the next variant that's coming. Hopefully
[00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.700]   that'll be less deadly, less contagious, which is tends to be
[00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.600]   how these things go. But we also predicted some people are
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.540]   just going to start requiring vaccines, vaccine cards, and we
[00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.500]   mentioned what's happening in France. And I don't know what
[00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.220]   examples you've seen this week. Yeah,
[00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.040]   I thought last week when you made vaccine passports, the
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.280]   main issue I thought, well, let's put it this way. I think
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.400]   that was actually turned out to be great moderation, because
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.940]   what has been the big issue all
[00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.440]   over the world since the last episode vaccine passports, you
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.660]   saw it with Naftali Bennett in Israel, they are not taking any
[00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.500]   of this vaccine hesitancy. There's 9 million people in that
[00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.320]   country, 8 million are vaccinated, they're telling the
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.660]   last million, you got to go get vaccinated, he has laid down the
[00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.160]   law saying enough is enough a billion people have gotten
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.180]   vaccinated. It works. And for the last million of you who
[00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.220]   haven't gotten vaccinated, if you want to attend any function
[00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.980]   with more than 100 people, if you want to go to synagogue, if
[00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:22.880]   you want to go to a sports
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.080]   game, if you want to go to the mall, you have to be vaccinated,
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.800]   or you're going to get tested that day at your own expense.
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.820]   Everywhere you go, it's going to be so they're going to make it
[00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.860]   a real pain in the ass until you get vaccinated. You then
[00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.700]   separately had Roger Goodell basically doing the same thing
[00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.600]   in the NFL saying to players you will first of all, all the
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.420]   coaches have to get vaccinated. There was an anti vax coach who
[00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.700]   got fired. And then they don't have as much power with the
[00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.820]   players because the players have a union but Goodell said to them,
[00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.120]   listen, if you don't get vaccinated, you're going to get
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.440]   tested every day that you go to work. And if the team if there's
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.440]   an outbreak on the team and you guys miss a game, you're going
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.380]   to lose all of your salary, we're not going to put up with
[00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.820]   apparently there's a game last year during the during COVID,
[00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:17.600]   where it was a Ravens Steelers game. And half of the one of
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.220]   those teams, the Ravens, half of the first string was out with
[00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.760]   COVID or they were in isolation.
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.180]   protocol because they're around players, you know, obviously, if you're in a locker room,
[00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.360]   one player gets everyone's gonna be exposed. Right. So it turned out to be like one of the
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:35.920]   worst games that the NFL put on last year and get all saying we're not gonna put out product like
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:41.480]   that anymore. If you are the reason why the team misses a game, guess what you and all of your
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:46.560]   teammates are going to lose your salary. And since there's only 17 games in NFL season, you're
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.880]   talking about real real money. So you had Goodell doing that. And now you have Facebook and Google
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.880]   basically coming out saying, in order to go back to the office, you have to be vaccinated. Now it's
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:01.400]   a little bit of the soft, it's sort of more of the the iron fist beneath the velvet glove, because
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.680]   they are offering testing. So if you don't get vaccinated, you can get a test every time you go
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.720]   to the office. But unlike Israel, which is making you pay for it, you know, Facebook and Google are
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.760]   so rich, they're going to pay for it. So basically, what you're seeing here is that government is not
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:21.000]   in the US is not required to mandate federal workers. Otherwise, you have to get tested
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:29.760]   weekly. This is beyond now debatable. I think the funny thing is the Republicans, I think somewhere
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:34.200]   along the way realized, oh, my God, we're going to lose the midterm elections, they have found a way
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:41.280]   to find a single modality and behavior to steal defeat from the jaws of victory. You know, I think
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:47.640]   that the Republicans were probably trending to basically win back the house. And now I don't think
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.120]   that's the case. And you have a bunch of these people who are like, Oh, we're going to lose the
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:55.240]   race. And you have a bunch of these red state governors who are literally flipping their shit
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:00.760]   right now trying to figure out how to get their folks vaccinated. Many of these people may not
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:04.520]   even be able to vote come midterms, because they're either going to be dead or still sick. I
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:12.680]   mean, it's, it's, we've learned a lot. And at this point, you're being left with folks there. Again,
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.520]   there are people who do it for religious reasons. I get it. There are people that you know,
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.960]   are going to sort of like live off the grid and live by themselves. I get them too.
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:25.240]   But the folks that want to be a tax on the system or use public resources, I don't understand. And
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:29.240]   they're basically going to get singled out and discriminated against. And
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:34.600]   the carrot and the stick method here, I think is going to work because we saw a bunch of people
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:39.640]   sign up to get vaccinated in France once they said this, you can't go to a cafe or a bar. And I think
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:44.520]   that the lot of the people who are not vaccinated are probably enjoying going out and having a life.
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:49.640]   Danny Meyer, the restaurant tour in New York from Union Square Cafe and Gramercy Tavern, one of the
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:54.600]   most famous restaurant tours of all time, announced on CNBC this morning, that he'll be requiring
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:08:01.400]   vaccines for all staff and customers. What do we think of that restaurant saying you've got to show
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:06.120]   a vax card on the way in? If I love it, listen to me, if I'm going to go in, and I'm going to spend
[00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:12.440]   two or $3,000 on wine, and then a couple thousand bucks on a tip. I don't want some asshole who's
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:17.720]   gonna get me sick there. It's bad enough that I still may get sick. And by the way, Danny Meyers
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:24.040]   restaurants are not like, you know, fucking, you know, Red Robin. These are extremely high end
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:30.520]   places. The idea that you can get a communicable respiratory disease and spend $5,000 is
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:32.760]   bullsh*t. Untenable, untenable.
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:33.480]   Non-starter.
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:40.840]   Sax, I mean, listen, you've, you, very interesting last episode, I felt like you were
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:47.400]   really trying to balance your belief in freedom and people being able to make decisions,
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:53.720]   themselves with, you know, the reality that we can't be close forever. How has the last week
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.640]   changed your thinking? And what do you think of the Danny Meyer?
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:09:02.280]   I like what Danny Meyer did in this sense, he wants to create a certain experience for
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:08.200]   his clientele. And he knows that his clientele are more likely to go dine in his restaurants.
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:12.760]   If there's a vaccine policy at his restaurants, he's not saying the policy for the whole country,
[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:17.080]   he's setting it for his establishment, he has every right to be able to do that.
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:21.160]   And he believes that will help his bottom line. And he's probably right about that.
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:26.360]   Similarly, Roger Goodell, same thing. I mean, he took a tough line because he knows that if
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:30.760]   he wants the NFL to put out a great product every week, they can't be canceling games
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:35.560]   because of COVID outbreaks. You know, they can't have the first string players out with COVID.
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:39.640]   So he made a smart business decision. I think people should have the freedom and the right to
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:46.760]   do that. Now, I still have, let's call it a reservation about government requiring it.
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:52.440]   Not because I don't see the benefit, I definitely see the health benefit. But just because I don't
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:58.120]   like giving government the power to, you know, stick a stick a needle in your arm.
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:02.920]   If you're a government employee, I do think the government has added power.
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:05.720]   We talked about this last week, they can make it a job requirement.
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:12.040]   And, you know, what's interesting in California, California said, if you're a state employee,
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:15.800]   you got to get vaccinated. But the one group they singled out were the teachers.
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:21.400]   Because, you know, Gavin Newsom has no guts to stand up the teachers union whatsoever. And I
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:26.600]   find it so ironic that early in the pandemic, we had this big debate about whether the teachers
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:30.840]   would go back to school in the fall. And the teachers union said we won't go back unless
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:35.000]   we're first in line for the vaccine. Well, guess what, they got that. Now they're saying they're
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.960]   not going to go back if you make us get back. I mean, you can't win with moving the goalposts.
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:46.120]   I mean, people want to post they want to work from home. They it's kind of ridiculous. There's one
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:50.440]   group that needs to do it most and they should be the one it's kind of like the army and teachers
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:55.800]   and healthcare workers. They should be given a mandate. If you want this job, you must be
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:11:00.040]   vaccinated. You cannot be in the army, in the military and not be vaccinated because we need
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:07.160]   you in close quarters on a helicopter to go whack Osama bin Laden. We can't have a COVID outbreak in
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:12.600]   the Navy SEALs. When we got to go. I'm okay with that. I think I think every employer has the right
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.800]   to require it if they believe it's going to impact job performance. Now, I want to go back to the
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:20.520]   point that you made about the midterm elections. I because I there's a part I agree with and a part
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:27.320]   I disagree with. So the part I agree with is that the Republicans were cruising to, you know, a
[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:34.680]   midterm slacking and now the the whole vaccine hesitancy issue. I think there was a prospect
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:41.800]   of that causing damage that Republicans not because most Republicans are vaccine hesitant,
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:45.480]   but rather because Republican politicians were not out for
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:49.080]   out front enough on getting vaccines. But look, there's a difference between reality and
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:54.360]   perception here. Here's the reality. Every single Republican governor, every single one has been
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:12:00.360]   vaccinated and has supported the vaccine. Mitch McConnell is vaccinated sports vaccine. Kevin
[00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:06.120]   McCarthy put out a statement you even have the House Minority Whip Scalise get vaccinated on
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:10.440]   on live TV. Why had he not been vaccinated because he already had COVID and he didn't actually think
[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:15.160]   he needed but he got the vaccine anyway, to basically double down. You had Sarah Huckabee
[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:19.720]   Sanders come out and say that she was getting the Trump she called it the Trump vaccine.
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:24.760]   Yes, please. If they put the Trump logo on it, right? I mean, she understands right? Like this
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:30.760]   is probably you know, Operation Lightspeed or Warp Speed or whatever was probably the biggest
[00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:35.000]   operation operation fuck up the midterms. That's what the Republican should call this. Yeah,
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:41.400]   well, so look, I mean, the Republican politicians in the main support vaccines. The problem is that
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:44.840]   they were being a little bit too quiet about it. And as a result of that you have the fringe
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:50.840]   people, the Marjorie Taylor greens, and so forth. They were occupying too much airspace around this
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:56.200]   issue. And you know, frankly, you know, right now, I think that I think the Democrats are going to
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:13:02.280]   keep those. I wouldn't I wouldn't necessarily go that far. But because I think that I think the
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:06.840]   Republican problem was not that they're vaccine hesitant, but rather that they were just being a
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:12.360]   little too quiet about it. But now I think that's changed. I mean, there's not a single major
[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:14.520]   Republican politician who isn't strongly involved.
[00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:44.200]   I mean, I think that's a really simple offering for them. New
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:50.920]   information, new strain, new approach. Listen, we didn't anticipate Delta would happen. This is 10
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:55.160]   times more people to save face basically, they can save face, you got a perfect offer. Listen,
[00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:59.480]   there's new information here. This thing is even the CDC hasn't officially changed their policy
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:03.400]   yet. I mean, it's coming, right? We know it's coming. They've always been behind the curve.
[00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:08.200]   We predicted the policy change on the show, anywhere from two weeks to two months before
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:13.880]   they actually do it. But look on the vaccine, I don't discern a difference in position.
[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:17.480]   I don't see any difference in position on the vaccine itself, between Republican governors and
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:22.760]   Democrat governors. They both are advocating it. They're both allowing private organizations to
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:29.720]   require it. But none of them, to my knowledge, have either had the guts or the temerity, however,
[00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:34.280]   you want to see it to actually require it. Oh, I love that word temerity, temerity.
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:37.720]   Not really used, not used enough. And just putting a cap in this before we
[00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:42.760]   move on to what's going on in China. We talked about implementing this and how do you implement
[00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:43.080]   it? Yeah, absolutely. So, you know, we talked about implementing this and how do you implement it?
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:48.360]   Well, we don't need to have a national registry. People have vaccine cards, you bring your vaccine
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:54.520]   card, you show it. And then of course, people go to Well, what happens if you create a fact?
[00:14:54.520 --> 00:15:00.520]   Can anybody create a fake vaccine card? Yes, of course you can. But the FBI has put out
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:07.240]   a statement now because of Lollapalooza, the music festival. They are saying do not buy a
[00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:11.960]   fake vaccine card. Because if you want to have no mask at Lollapalooza, you have to
[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:19.720]   show your vaccine card and they said the FBI is tweeting about this. It's illegal, it endangers
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:23.400]   yourself and those around you. And it's a federal crime that could lead to hefty fines or prison
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:29.880]   time. Oh my god. Yeah. So show us your papers. Just get the vaccine and just get the vaccine,
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:36.120]   folks. Why are we really not? Oh, my God. It's quickly becoming a Darwin Award. This is quickly
[00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:39.880]   moving into Darwin Award territory. We are. I talked to my doctor and I was like,
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:42.440]   I want to get the Moderna or J&J. Which one should I get?
[00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:45.640]   And they're like, we got the Pfizer already. I'm like, I want to take a second. Like,
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:48.280]   I don't think that's gonna make a difference. I was like, I think it's totally gonna make a
[00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:51.800]   difference. It was like when we got off the pod last week. And they're like, yeah, I was like,
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:54.680]   well, just give me the third shot of Pfizer then and they're like, well, that's not necessary
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:58.440]   either. I'm like, I don't care if it's not necessary. I want it. Give me the third shot
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:02.760]   of Pfizer. And then I opened up Drudge Report yesterday. And it's like third shot of vaccine
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:06.600]   of Pfizer in Israel or whatever. They're just gonna start giving people a third shot. Yeah,
[00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:08.040]   I just want to get ahead of the curve.
[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:12.120]   You're exactly right. But by the way, there's one other piece of news that came out that I think is
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:18.120]   very positive on COVID, which is the availability of these oral antivirals, the pills.
[00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:21.160]   That you can take when you get an early case of it.
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:25.480]   Right. So it's like what they have for Tamiflu with the flu, like no one should ever die of the
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:30.760]   flu because Tamiflu is like completely effective at stopping it provided you take Tamiflu early
[00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:35.880]   in the case. So I think that you know, with the reduced effectiveness of vaccine, what we're going
[00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:41.800]   to have to do is supplement the vaccines and the boosters with home testing. And then you
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:47.240]   know, these oral antivirals so that you get you take a test, you discover you got COVID and you
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:52.280]   immediately get prescribed, you know, one of these these pills and the pharma companies are coming
[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:56.120]   out. There's like three different pharma companies coming out with these oral antivirals. And if
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:17:01.400]   Freeburg were here, he could tell us all about it. Freeburg explain the science behind this.
[00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:05.320]   You know what the science can go fuck itself. Hey, Danny Meyer, chill a great bottle of white
[00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:10.920]   burgundy because I'm coming baby. I'm vaccinated and I'm coming. Let's go baby, vaxxed and ready to go.
[00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:18.680]   Oh my lord. All right. The China situation has been perplexing to me. You know, my position was
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:24.680]   always be careful working in China or investing in China. We're investing in Chinese companies
[00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:29.000]   because they could change the rules at any time and change the rules they have in the past
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:35.800]   year we talked about obviously and financial and Jack Ma going MIA,
[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:41.160]   ByteDance a CEO and founder, stepping down as CEO amid Chinese regulations and
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:50.760]   all this scrutiny. And then we have DD last week being pulled from the App Store in an unprecedented
[00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:57.080]   penalty where you're not allowed to download DD and the existing users can use it. And then on
[00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:05.160]   top of that, all the educational companies this week, were told that they cannot operate as for
[00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:10.840]   profit companies and these companies have gone public in Hong Kong and in the West. And this has
[00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:17.320]   caused such an acute effect SoftBank is clearing a bunch of its Uber position to cover their losses
[00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:23.400]   in DD. And then there is the story of Larry Chan, who is a Chinese education entrepreneur, he was
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:30.680]   worth 15 billion in January. Now he's lost 99% of his net worth. According to Bloomberg, he founded
[00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:37.080]   Gaotu Teichido or Techido, which is a Chinese online tutoring firm as we know education is huge
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:39.560]   in China.
[00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:47.880]   That company, Gaotu, peaked at $140 a share in January and has fallen to $3 a share.
[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:54.840]   Big sordid story there. Tencent lost 100 billion in market cap in three days earlier this week as
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:59.480]   China cracked down on what they call the monopoly and music rights. So while we debate what happens
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:04.280]   with the monopolies here in the United States, China just literally told them, and here's the
[00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:08.440]   quote from the BBC article, "The company and its affiliated businesses have been told that they can
[00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:10.200]   no longer engage in exclusive deals over music rights. They are no longer engaged in exclusive deals over
[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:14.200]   music rights and must dissolve any existing agreements within 30 days." I mean, this would be
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:20.120]   like Biden just saying, the App Store is now open, you have to let other app stores in Apple or,
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:24.760]   you know, just coming down and saying to Amazon, you can't sell Amazon Basics anymore in 30 days,
[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:31.560]   no more Amazon Basics at the site. What do we, what do you think the end game is here? Is this a
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:36.520]   because China seems like they are very deliberate and they plan in centuries. What is happening
[00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:38.600]   here? There's the short term and the long term. I think what's happening here is that the long term,
[00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:45.400]   I think what's happening in the short term is that the same thing that we are talking about
[00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:51.080]   in the United States that Sachs is, you know, very eloquently, basically, I think led most
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:56.360]   everybody in just really framing for a lot of people is this idea that, you know, we have
[00:19:56.360 --> 00:20:01.400]   privatized free speech, and we have put the distribution of information into the hands of
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:08.280]   three or four founders, CEO oligarchs. That's also true in China. And when you look under the hood,
[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:14.200]   of the major internet companies, there's four or five guys that are in charge. And so I think that
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:21.640]   in the United States, politicians feel increasingly uneasy with those folks having power because it's
[00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:26.920]   applied indiscriminately. Trump gets banned, Trump may not get banned, this person gets distribution,
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:31.080]   this article is considered misinformation, that article is considered disinformation, this article
[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:36.920]   is suppressed. It's a dangerous place to be. And in China, they were just like, enough's enough.
[00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:37.960]   So I think the short term,
[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:42.280]   as it relates to the internet companies was basically a realization that we are not going
[00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:48.440]   to allow any more devolution of power from the Chinese Communist Party to and into the hands
[00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:51.880]   of these internet entrepreneurs. So that was, that was sort of like the
[00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:55.320]   So it's a move out of fear, they're scared, they're gonna lose their power base.
[00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:58.040]   Not scared. I think they're just smart. And they were like,
[00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:02.920]   we're not going to allow this to happen. So they don't have to deal with Section 230 or any
[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:07.640]   law like that. I think it was just a realization that we want them to understand who is
[00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:13.480]   boss. Right. And so there was a wave of resignations, there was now all of this
[00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:19.240]   market cap upheaval. And this is now where we get to sort of like the appetizer. And I think in the
[00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:27.160]   appetizer, what they're basically saying is, we will control how money is made and who makes money.
[00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:32.040]   And I think that that sets up the really difficult thing that I think happens, which is about the
[00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:37.320]   long term. So in this in this thing, what's happening right now is China, very firmly telling
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:45.560]   everybody, we are firmly in control, there is no private market. And there is no capital market
[00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:50.680]   without our approval. And that's a really big statement. And in fact, it was such a big
[00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:55.400]   statement that I think the Chinese security authorities and had like a conference call
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:59.560]   at Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, all these folks were invited. And you know, the vice chairman,
[00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:04.360]   basically, his quote was something to the effect of, we promise that any more changes will at least
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:07.000]   let you know, not a there's nothing here.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.840]   Nothing, nothing to see here, or there's nothing more to come. It's just more that
[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:14.680]   as we decide new rules, we'll make sure that we give you guys enough warning.
[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:20.920]   So it's very much firmly saying, we know exactly how money is made, we will decide who makes money
[00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:25.000]   in what way. And we're going to make sure that, you know, all of this wealth creation
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:31.640]   happens under terms that we define. And I think that the setup for the long term, the long term
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:36.280]   in China is complicated. It is an enormous demographic time bomb. We've talked about this
[00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:36.680]   before.
[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:42.600]   By the end of 2100, China's population will shrink from 1.1 1.2 billion people down to about
[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:48.680]   700 million people. Right? So they had very progressive, quote unquote, under their
[00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:54.520]   framework, laws of one child policy to basically make it economically viable in the 60s and 70s.
[00:22:54.520 --> 00:23:00.360]   There was such a number of people, those people were able to get great jobs in the,
[00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:06.360]   you know, 80s and 90s and 2000s. And now they've realized, oh, wow, we made a huge,
[00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:11.080]   huge miscalculation, because now there is just not enough people. And so China is going to shrink.
[00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:17.000]   And I think that honestly, I think Xi Jinping probably thinks the simplest way to solve this
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:22.200]   is to basically nationalize a lot of the economy over time. And so I, if I was a betting man,
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:26.200]   which I am general, but I'm not in China, because I just don't understand the market. It's super
[00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:29.960]   complicated. Casino, it's a stupid place to bet. I'm not going to say that I just think that I
[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:35.800]   don't know the market. Well, I mean, they changed the rules of the game. Hold on, let me just finish.
[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:40.280]   What I think, I think that what we're starting, what we're starting to see is the beginning
[00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:46.360]   of nationalizations. And I think it's going to start in technology universe, because those are
[00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:50.760]   the critical assets that the Chinese need to own for the future. So that's, in my opinion,
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:56.200]   what's happening. I think it's really important. What's going on there. And yeah,
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:58.680]   yeah. Sax, when you look at this, we've been talking about,
[00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:04.440]   you know, this, these two great competitors, America and China and who's gonna win? How does
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:05.240]   China win?
[00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:09.400]   If this would seem not having a vibrant,
[00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:17.160]   entrepreneurial, you know, socialist, communist hybrid, is this the end of that experiment? And
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:21.480]   now it's just going to go all national? And then that doesn't that make it easier for the West to
[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:25.800]   win? If China is just going to say we're going to, we're going to operate everything, and they don't
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:30.360]   have a competition of ideas? If they go that far, I think it's really interesting, actually,
[00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:34.440]   to compare what's happening in China with what's happening on the US in the US, because on the
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:34.680]   surface, China is going to win. But if they go all national, then China is going to win. And if they
[00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:35.400]   go all national, then China is going to win. But if they go all national, then China is going to win.
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:40.440]   Both countries are having this debate about whether big tech needs to be reined in broken up
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:44.760]   controlled. We're having that debate in the US and obviously they're having some version of it in
[00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:50.040]   China, but it's a little bit like the the civil rights debate, right, where you know, we have our
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:55.800]   civil rights issue in the US. And you know, they have Shinzen, you know, they have the Uyghurs,
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:25:01.240]   you know, it's like a whole order of magnitude different in terms of the way they react. And I
[00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:01.720]   think there's, I would say there's three main differences here. One is that China is going to win.
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:01.720]   The other is that China is going to win. And I think there's, I would say there's three main differences here.
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:01.720]   And I think there's, I would say there's three main differences here.
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:04.920]   And I think there's, I would say there's three main differences here.
[00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:12.520]   Between the Chinese approach, and the US approach. Number one, data privacy, we have a concept of
[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:18.680]   separation between private companies and the data they control, and the data that the US government
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:22.920]   can get its hands on. And the US government typically has to get a warrant and go through
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:27.800]   a corporate scene to get that data. What China is doing, they've now passed a law, basically saying
[00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:31.640]   all these companies, your data belongs to us. If we want it, we get it, they're taking it, they're
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:31.680]   taking it. And we're going to have to get it back. And so, you know, we're going to have to get it back.
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:31.700]   And so, you know, we're going to have to get it back. And so, you know, we're going to have to get it back.
[00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:35.380]   You're taking operational control over the data, and you know, they're going to use it. Okay.
[00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:41.140]   That's a big difference. Number two, I think that China seems to be really worried about
[00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:48.740]   these big tech companies, not just in terms of whether they might engage in anti competitive
[00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:53.380]   practices or consumer harm, sort of those conventional antitrust concepts in the United
[00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:59.940]   States. But they're concerned about these big tech moguls becoming power centers in China.
[00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:01.660]   And you saw this with Jack Ma, right?
[00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:07.900]   I mean, clearly, the CCP had a problem with the way that Jack Ma had become a figure that people
[00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:12.540]   rallied around him, they looked to him, they cared about what he had to say. And all of a sudden, yes,
[00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:17.740]   the ant IPO was put on hold. But it was more than that, right? You know, this was not just like, you
[00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:21.740]   know, what the SEC would have done. All of a sudden, Jack Ma disappears, he goes into some sort
[00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:27.500]   of house arrest, he comes out three months later, looking kind of emaciated. You know, they are
[00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:31.580]   putting the the fear of God in, you know, these big tech moguls in a way that we wouldn't even know.
[00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:35.820]   And they would never do in the US. I mean, look, I don't want Tim Cook to engage in anti competitive
[00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:39.740]   practices. But I don't want anything bad happening to Tim Cook, I don't think the guy should be under
[00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:44.060]   house arrest. If he wants to donate his money to political causes and speak out as a private
[00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:48.460]   citizen, he has every right to do that. And I'll defend his right to do that no matter, you know,
[00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:52.620]   how much I want, you know, Apple to be reined in that they don't have that, that again, that
[00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:57.660]   separate concept in China. And I think the last thing that's going on here, that's different,
[00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:01.500]   is you saw China put the kibosh on there are 34
[00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:08.140]   IPOs of major China, Chinese tech companies that were scheduled to IPO in US markets, and
[00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:13.580]   they have sort of shut that pipeline down. And what it appears to be to they appear to be saying
[00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:18.620]   is that, you know, we've talked about reshoring strategic industries back to the US like
[00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:23.980]   pharmaceutical manufacturing, they seem to be saying we are going to reshore the IPO business,
[00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:31.420]   we do not want you big Chinese tech companies IPO on American markets on American exchanges, we are
[00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:36.700]   bringing that business back to China. And that is why I think you're seeing, you know, giant ripple
[00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:42.380]   effects now, because I mean, to touch my point about decoupling, we now it looks like are going
[00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:49.100]   to be decoupling our financial markets. And, you know, that's why you're seeing, you know, gigantic
[00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:50.140]   hits to the valuation.
[00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:54.620]   That's a would you would you agree with me that the decoupling of these financial markets might be
[00:27:54.620 --> 00:28:00.700]   in the best interest of humanity and ultimately the decoupling of these two economies if we don't
[00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:01.340]   see eye to eye about that?
[00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:02.380]   Yeah, I mean, I think it's a good point. I think it's a good point. I think it's a good point. I
[00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:02.460]   think it's a good point. I think it's a good point. I think it's a good point. I think it's a good point.
[00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:06.860]   And how to treat people. Maybe it's good that we have a little more distance between the two
[00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:11.900]   markets. I mean, it's hard to know if engagement is the better process. But it doesn't seem like
[00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:17.020]   the Chinese Communist Party wants to have anything to do with democracy,
[00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:20.300]   anything to do with free markets, they want to control all the markets.
[00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:24.220]   Yeah, I mean, you could see, but you know, in a way,
[00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:31.260]   the product that the US was exporting to China was was our financial markets and not and it
[00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:36.700]   is I think a good way, right? So that I think the bad version of this is when China is able to buy up
[00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:42.700]   ownership in critical strategic centers in the US and that affects people's speech rights over here.
[00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:49.420]   But this is not China buying up ownership in the US. This was China acting as a consumer of US
[00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:55.420]   financial markets. And I think it's different, right? When we're selling products over there,
[00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:57.180]   that helps correct our trade balance, right?
[00:28:57.180 --> 00:29:01.180]   This is why I don't have a problem with Elon selling cars over in China. He's
[00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:06.300]   helping our trade balance. Okay, but so but they're kind of canceling that they're kind of
[00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:11.580]   saying we're going to reshore this industry, we want to have a domestic, you know, market.
[00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:14.860]   This is creating a mono economy,
[00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:21.100]   right? It's like, it's going to blur the lines between public and private ownership. And it's
[00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:30.140]   going to basically make it one huge pot from which the Chinese government can take and put it back
[00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:31.100]   into as a deal.
[00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:34.220]   And I think it's a very, very important point. I think it's a very important point. And I think it's
[00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:35.020]   a very important point. And I think it's a very important point. And I think it's a very important
[00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:40.220]   point. So if you're a CEO, and they don't like you, you're going to resign, right? If you're a
[00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:45.820]   company, and they're worried about your propensity to be a little too frisky on your own, they'll
[00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:49.420]   rein you in the live the live, they use cybersecurity law or something else. But the
[00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:55.660]   point is that I think that we shouldn't take this as free market regulators having their way. This
[00:29:55.660 --> 00:30:01.020]   isn't Lina Khan implementing, you know, some laws, this is a top down
[00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:08.220]   decision to nationalize large parts of the economy, starting with technology. And I know
[00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:15.980]   that for some people that may seem unfathomable, but if I'm a betting man, which I am, that's what
[00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:22.060]   I would bet on that this is the beginning of the beginning of an attempt to pull these companies in.
[00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:27.420]   I mean, at the end, what David said is true. The Chinese government owns the data of Chinese
[00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:30.940]   companies. So at the end of the day, the Chinese government also owns the
[00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:34.380]   users and it also owns the revenues. It just hasn't told you yet.
[00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:39.660]   Yeah, in a way, it's like the Chinese government in our government is trying to officiate the game
[00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:45.980]   fairly, and create a really competitive, vibrant game. And I think what the Chinese
[00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:48.700]   government just said is the game's over. Like there is no game. Yeah,
[00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:55.660]   no, there's a game it just has it just has one because it has an Uber CEO, it made a bunch of
[00:30:55.660 --> 00:31:00.860]   CEOs, general managers in a large corporation that report through a reporting chain,
[00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:02.860]   and they're like, Oh, we're gonna get the best of this. And then they're like, Oh, we're gonna get a lot of money.
[00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:06.460]   But there's no more game in terms of building companies and investing in China. Like,
[00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:12.140]   how is the West ever going to trust? How is Goldman Sachs or Sequoia, you know, launching a
[00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:16.540]   venture firm there or retail investors or hedge fund investors? How are they ever going to want
[00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:20.780]   to participate in that market? Because so look, for example, when you invest in China, right,
[00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:25.660]   or if you set up a fund, you know, there are two pools of capital, right? There's the local remember
[00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:30.380]   denominated investment vehicles, and then there's the US dollar denominated investment vehicles. And
[00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:35.340]   you do that to segregate where the capital comes from. So it's not too difficult for the Chinese
[00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:41.100]   government to basically say, you know what, I'm going to actually make a constraint on dollar
[00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:46.940]   inflows, so that you know, the remember denominated investment funds that are from Chinese investors
[00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:51.340]   into Chinese companies needs to be above a certain percentage, call it two thirds, right, or call it
[00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:55.740]   80%. They can make all these decisions, because these are all just rules that are completely under
[00:31:55.740 --> 00:32:00.700]   the control. So I think that people who don't think this is going to happen, are probably
[00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:05.660]   going to have to reconsider. I think it's a very, very difficult question. And I think it's a very,
[00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:09.660]   very difficult question. I think it's a very difficult question. And I think it's a very,
[00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:11.900]   very difficult question. And I think it's a very difficult question. And I think it's a very, very,
[00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:15.020]   very difficult question. I think it's a very, very difficult question. And I think it's a very, very,
[00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:18.780]   very difficult question. And I think it's a very, very difficult question. And I think it's a very,
[00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:21.980]   very difficult question. And I think it's a very, very difficult question. And I think it's a very,
[00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:23.420]   very difficult question. And I think it's a very, very difficult question. And I think it's a very,
[00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:24.780]   very difficult question. And I think it's a very, very difficult question. And I think it's a very,
[00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:28.940]   very difficult question. And I think it's a very, very difficult question. And I think it's a very,
[00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:31.020]   very difficult question. And I think it's a very, very difficult question. And I think it's a very,
[00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:33.020]   very difficult question. And I think it's a very, very difficult question. And I think it's a very,
[00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:35.020]   very difficult question. And I think it's a very, very difficult question. And I think it's a very,
[00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:36.940]   very difficult question. And I think it's a very, very difficult question. And I think it's a very,
[00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:39.020]   very difficult question. And I think it's a very, very difficult question. And I think it's a very,
[00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:41.020]   very difficult question. And I think it's a very, very difficult question. And I think it's a very,
[00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:43.020]   very difficult question. And I think it's a very, very difficult question. And I think it's a very,
[00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:45.020]   very difficult question. And I think it's a very, very difficult question. And I think it's a very,
[00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:47.020]   very difficult question. And I think it's a very, very difficult question. And I think it's a very,
[00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:49.020]   very difficult question. And I think it's a very, very difficult question. And I think it's a very,
[00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:51.020]   very difficult question. And I think it's a very, very difficult question. And I think it's a very,
[00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:53.020]   very difficult question. And I think it's a very, very difficult question. And I think it's a very,
[00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:55.020]   very difficult question. And I think it's a very, very difficult question. And I think it's a very,
[00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:57.020]   very difficult question. And I think it's a very, very difficult question. And I think it's a very,
[00:32:57.020 --> 00:32:59.020]   very difficult question. And I think it's a very, very difficult question. And I think it's a very,
