[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   The following is my conversation with my new friend, Mr. Goose.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   He's quite shy, quite distant, but underneath there is a depth that I would love to explore.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   I was wondering if you could tell me about art.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   What do you think is beautiful in this world?
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   How do you think of beauty?
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   And everything you've seen on these trails, and everything you've eaten,
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   what do you find beautiful?
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   What do you think of Bukowski, who said, "To do a dangerous thing with style."
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   That's what I call art.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   You clearly have style.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   The way you're distant makes me long for your attention.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   I feel like that's a precondition for being a great artist.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   Where are you going?
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   I'm sorry I didn't prepare for this conversation as much as I could have.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   You can't always run away from yourself.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   I hope you find what you're looking for, Mr. Goose.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   I hope you find it in those green bushes your heart pushes you toward,
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   or out there in the sea.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Take care of yourself, Mr. Goose. Thank you.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Thank you for at least giving me a chance.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Goodbye.
