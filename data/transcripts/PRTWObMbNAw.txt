[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.040]   Hi, my name is Rachel. I'm a wife and a mom of school-age kids from northern Indiana.
[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:14.360]   I've been a Desiring God ministry partner for 14 years, and you are listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast with Jon Typer.
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:22.920]   Rachel has an important story to share with us, and I want you to hear it.
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.760]   It's about the importance of Bible faithfulness. That in a moment. But on this theme of carefulness with God's Word,
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.640]   we have a question today from a listener named David about how progressive can a progressive Christian get?
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.480]   Here's what he asks.
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.440]   Dear Pastor John, thank you for this podcast. I have a colleague who would define himself as a progressive Christian.
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.400]   He believes homosexual practice is holy and people engaged in such acts are qualified to be leaders in the church.
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.900]   He also believes the Old Testament is completely metaphorical and cannot be trusted in any historical way.
[00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.480]   I believe both beliefs fly against what the Bible teaches and teaches about itself. My question is this,
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.920]   can you contradict the Bible at these levels and still be considered a Christian?
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.280]   I know it's impossible to have an infallible understanding of the whole Bible and that we will err in many ways.
[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:15.440]   I'm sure I do. But also, isn't there a line that cannot and must not be crossed, Pastor John? How progressively
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.920]   Christian can a real Christian get?
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:25.920]   So let me think out loud with you for just a moment about a couple of the words
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:34.400]   used in this question, and then I'll get right to giving as clear and biblical an answer as I can.
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.680]   Let's take the word
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.880]   "progressive." The reason this word has come to refer to people and
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:49.680]   views that go beyond what has historically been considered true to the Bible is
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.760]   not because the idea of progress
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.320]   is bad in itself. All of us want to see progress
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.400]   toward truth and goodness and beauty. The reason the word
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.240]   "progressive" has taken on the meaning it has is
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.160]   because it has come to imply a progress away
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.360]   from the truth and toward error,
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.320]   progress away
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.800]   from biblical holiness toward
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.720]   morality. And here's a really interesting and, I think, significant thing,
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.280]   namely, that the idea of progressiveness
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.280]   is in the Bible. Even the word and
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.920]   the idea are in the Bible. I didn't know this until a few years ago when I was trying to do
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:49.160]   careful translation of 2 John. So here's 2 John 1 7-9. It goes like this,
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.280]   "Many deceivers have gone out into the world,
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:03:00.280]   those who do not confess the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh. Such a one is the deceiver and the Antichrist.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.040]   Watch yourselves,
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.600]   so that you may not lose what you have worked for, but may win a full reward." And here comes
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.040]   everyone who
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:18.440]   goes on ahead. Now the Greek there is "pro-ago," who progresses. So you could translate it
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.680]   "Everyone who progresses,"
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.240]   or you could say, to bring it right up to date, "Everyone who is progressive and
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.560]   does not abide in
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.120]   the teaching of Christ does not have God."
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:41.720]   So here is a use of the word "progress" or "going on ahead" in the sense of leaving
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:48.000]   true teaching behind. In other words, a person can forsake the Christian faith,
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.320]   not just by swerving
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:57.640]   to the right or to the left, but by going ahead, straight ahead, and leaving behind
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.560]   the truth and
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.280]   grasping for things that are coming, things that do not fit with
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.240]   the faith once for all delivered to the saints, though they may fit the spirit of the age.
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.880]   So we have a yellow flag
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.000]   waving—I suppose I should say red flag—
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.680]   waving in the Bible,
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.840]   "Beware! Beware of those who get frustrated with abiding,
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.160]   standing firm." You could stick in the word "conserving."
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.720]   You've got the political polls.
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:38.880]   Let's just stay with the Bible words. "Abiding, standing firm in the teaching of Christ,
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:45.520]   holding fast to old, sure truth, and who are restless."
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:53.360]   The alternative is that they get restless with the old and the firm and the true, and they want change and they want newness,
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.040]   especially change that fits the spirit of the times.
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.040]   Now, of course,
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.620]   lots of non-essential things
[00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.480]   need change from age to age and culture to culture,
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.600]   and that's not an issue here. But lots of essential things
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.360]   do not need to change and must not change if we are to be faithful
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.480]   Christians. Now, the second word
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.420]   that I wanted to make a comment about is the word "considered"
[00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.040]   in his question. David asks,
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.600]   "Can you contradict the Bible
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.080]   at these levels that he
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.240]   itemized
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.900]   and still be
[00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.900]   considered a Christian?"
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:45.760]   That's a good way to ask the question. He didn't say, "Can you contradict the Bible at these levels and be a Christian?"
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.780]   Now, the answer to that question is more complicated,
[00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:56.340]   because the person might be on the brink of repenting from a temporarily
[00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:00.720]   destructive, unbiblical, heretical view, and we can't see it.
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:07.680]   He might have dipped into it, been gripped by it, be on the brink of repentance, come out of it, prove to be a long-term
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:12.560]   great Christian, and we can't see any of that. Only God can see things like that.
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.080]   Our job in the church is not
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:24.480]   to make final, decisive, infallible decisions about who is truly born again and who isn't.
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.720]   Our job
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.140]   is to decide who should be considered
[00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:36.000]   a Christian—that is, who should belong to the visible church
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.440]   and who should be disciplined or
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.380]   excommunicated from
[00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:44.400]   the visible church.
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.080]   And we make these decisions not because we're God,
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:54.320]   but because we are called to form judgments on the basis of what we can see
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:07:00.080]   and what we can hear and what we know in the Bible. God looks on the heart.
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:05.840]   We look on the fruit of the heart—namely, what a person believes
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.400]   and how a person acts.
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:13.380]   So with those two clarifications of progressive and considered,
[00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:16.960]   my answer to the question is this.
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.040]   Yes,
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.040]   there is a line
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:27.760]   which a person may cross which puts him in a position of rightly being
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:30.000]   considered
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   a non-Christian,
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.280]   having once professed to be a Christian, because
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.100]   of some unrepentant behavior
[00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:44.020]   or some belief that the Bible itself shows to undermine salvation.
[00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:49.680]   Let's just take one of David's examples. He says that his colleague believes
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.560]   homosexual practice is holy
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:57.120]   and people engaged in such acts are qualified to be leaders
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.360]   in the church.
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.360]   So there are two questions here.
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.740]   One is whether
[00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:05.100]   practicing
[00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:10.060]   homosexual acts without repentance puts one in a position where he should be
[00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:12.020]   considered
[00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:14.020]   a non-Christian, and the other is
[00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:17.220]   whether a person who celebrates
[00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:24.100]   that homosexual practice as good and pleasing to God, who may not themselves practice,
[00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:26.420]   should be considered
[00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:27.860]   a Christian.
[00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:30.500]   Little anecdote. In June of
[00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:38.180]   2002, the Synod of the Anglican Diocese of New Westminster in Vancouver, Canada
[00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:42.420]   authorized its bishop to produce a service
[00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:44.660]   for blessing
[00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:46.660]   same-sex unions.
[00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:49.060]   J.I. Packer,
[00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:51.060]   who has gone to be with the Lord now,
[00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:53.940]   a longtime member of that
[00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:56.260]   church, that denomination,
[00:08:56.660 --> 00:09:00.740]   walked out. He walked out. This is hard to imagine. This is
[00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:05.300]   "gentleman to the max," right? You spent a lot of time with Packer.
[00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.700]   Oh, totally. I don't know if it's easy for you.
[00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:11.620]   It's not easy for me to imagine J.I. Packer standing up and in
[00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:16.100]   rejection of something so serious that he would actually walk out.
[00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:24.420]   So here's what he wrote in January of 2003, and the title of the article in CT, you can go find it, is "Why I Walked."
[00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:31.380]   Why did I walk out with the others? Because this decision, taken in its context,
[00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:38.740]   1) falsifies the gospel of Christ, 2) abandons the authority of Scripture, 3)
[00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:41.520]   jeopardizes the salvation
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:49.460]   of fellow human beings, and 4) betrays the church in its God-appointed role as the bastion of the bulwark of divine truth.
[00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:53.540]   Now, why did he say that blessing
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:56.640]   homosexual unions
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:00.980]   falsifies the gospel? That's probably the most serious of the four.
[00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:07.220]   Because of 1 Corinthians 6, 9, and 10. He explained, but I'll just put my own words here.
[00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:12.900]   The text says, "Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God?
[00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:20.660]   Do not be deceived. Neither the sexually immoral, nor the idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality,
[00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:26.600]   nor thieves, nor greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers,
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.940]   nor swindlers,
[00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:31.940]   will inherit the kingdom of God."
[00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:34.660]   That's 1 Corinthians 6, 9, and 10.
[00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:40.500]   Now, the gospel of Jesus, the death of Jesus for sinners,
[00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:45.700]   is meant to rescue people for the kingdom of God,
[00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:48.980]   not keep them out of the kingdom of God.
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:57.360]   Therefore, when you celebrate the very behaviors which keep a person out of the kingdom of God, you are
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.840]   anti-gospel.
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:06.480]   You are pointing people into the very sin that Jesus died to rescue the people from.
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:11.600]   This is a falsification of the gospel. It is saying,
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:18.580]   "Jesus did not die for this." It doesn't need to be died for. It's beautiful.
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:21.280]   It's not damning.
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:23.680]   So, my conclusion is
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:30.660]   that both the person who persistently and unrepentantly carries on with adultery,
[00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:33.120]   theft,
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.460]   greed,
[00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:36.460]   homosexual practice, etc.,
[00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:39.360]   and the person who celebrates
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:42.720]   that person's self-destructive course,
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:46.160]   should not be considered Christians.
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:51.620]   That is, they should be disciplined as a church. They should be excluded
[00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:58.580]   from the visible church in the hope that the seriousness of that act would bring them to their senses
[00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:01.120]   and restore them
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.120]   to Christ and to
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:08.180]   fellowship. So, one principle then I close with—one principle
[00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:14.260]   for decisions about which beliefs and which behaviors
[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:18.240]   are in this category of seriousness—is
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:21.120]   whether there is biblical evidence
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:24.880]   that they actually undermine the gospel.
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:28.880]   The closer they get to jeopardizing souls
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:32.240]   in this way, the more fitting it is
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:36.980]   that their advocates should be considered non-Christian.
[00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:40.960]   What we do with the Bible matters infinitely. Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:45.600]   And speaking of the importance of our faithfulness to the text of Scripture and why that matters,
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:50.020]   I want you to hear Rachel's story. She lives with her husband and kids in northern Indiana.
[00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:56.640]   You heard her voice earlier, and she shares this conviction with us. We don't play games with the Bible.
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:00.240]   We preach what it says, verse by verse, without shame.
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:04.800]   Rachel's on the phone with me now to share a little of her journey. Rachel,
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:09.360]   thanks for taking some time out of your schedule. I know your days are very full and busy with little ones.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.240]   Share with us how you first learned of John Piper the preacher.
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:19.060]   I first heard of John Piper in 1999.
[00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:24.560]   I was a teenager headed off to college in a few weeks, and my grandma kind of
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:30.720]   convinced me or strong-armed me maybe into helping at a missionary conference in the kitchen.
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:34.480]   So it was August, and it was hot, and it was a kitchen.
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:42.320]   But there was a family at this missionary conference from the Twin Cities, and this guy was so excited to introduce his pastor to me.
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:47.600]   And so he popped in this cassette into his cassette player,
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:50.960]   and it was John Piper preaching
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:53.580]   somewhere in Romans.
[00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:55.580]   That was actually a pretty
[00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:58.720]   unremarkable event for me at the time, because I
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:01.520]   grew up with expository preaching. So
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:07.360]   he was preaching through Romans. My pastor back home had been preaching through Romans for several years,
[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:09.200]   and
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.200]   I thought that that was what
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.900]   churches did.
[00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:18.480]   Pastors got up, and they took the next five verses of Scripture and talked about it.
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:23.540]   And then you came back, and you took the next five verses the next week. Well, then I went off to college,
[00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:30.800]   and I grew a lot in college. I learned that I heard John Piper's name again and
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:37.600]   picked up his book and read Desiring God, which was helpful in learning to frame a worldview,
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:42.240]   to think about what I believed and why I believed it and how it affected the way I actually lived.
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:45.840]   I got married, and we went off, you know, started our own
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:50.500]   married life together, and we were just going to find a good, solid, expositional,
[00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:53.520]   gimmick-free church, and that was not
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:55.440]   easy.
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.600]   We discovered that that was actually quite hard to find.
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:01.620]   So for 20 years, we kind of experienced
[00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:04.400]   church extremes.
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:07.280]   We experienced church
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:15.440]   where there was a great emphasis placed on fruit without tending the root of faith and love for Christ.
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.920]   We learned that you can
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:20.160]   actually be in a place where
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.380]   theology is
[00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:24.560]   loved more than Christ is, and
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:29.440]   that was difficult. And then we also experienced church which
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:35.040]   had great love for Christ and wonderful people, full of wonderful people who served our
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:37.920]   children and loved the Lord and
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:40.800]   had wonderful community,
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.080]   but
[00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:47.680]   we would struggle on Sunday mornings with sermons there, just because the sermons were kind of like a box of chocolates.
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:51.280]   You didn't know any given Sunday what you were going to get. So
[00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:54.560]   DG for us for 20 years was
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:57.360]   a constant resource of
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:59.580]   solid,
[00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:01.680]   consistent, biblical teaching—
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:06.880]   a place where we could go if we had specific questions on a certain issue, but
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:09.920]   also mainly just
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:12.400]   for consistent food
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:15.920]   to feed our souls when we weren't getting that somewhere else.
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:18.480]   Powerful. Thank you, Rachel.
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:25.200]   You're talking right now to several listeners of the podcast, some of who are struggling in the same way—hungry for a church that preaches
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:27.200]   the Bible expositionally
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:30.640]   and for a church that loves Christ with great affection. So
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:36.560]   speak to our listeners now who turn to Desiring God for Resources for faithful Bible teaching,
[00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:42.880]   but maybe have never thought it is important to also support the work that we do here. What would you say to them?
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:47.120]   I would actually echo something that I heard Randy Alcorn say
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:50.160]   a few years ago.
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:54.880]   He said something to the effect that if you believe the Word of God is true,
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:56.640]   and
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:58.640]   it's clear,
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:04.400]   you need to seek out ministries who believe that and support them, because there are getting to be fewer and fewer of them.
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:08.080]   And that struck a chord with me.
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:10.960]   That's why
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:14.560]   we began giving. It's why we're still giving.
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:21.380]   The fact that anybody all over the world can go to DG and get solid resources
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:25.360]   that are based on the Word of God
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:32.800]   for free, no registration. They don't even have to give an email. Any poor college student living on ramen can go get it.
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:36.560]   It is a blessing. It's been a blessing to us. It's been a blessing to many.
[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:42.960]   I would encourage anyone to support Desiring God who has benefited from it.
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:50.640]   Wow. Well, 14 years of supporting Desiring God is a huge and strategic investment in our work, Rachel. Thank you. You're welcome.
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:54.880]   So many precious friends have come alongside us and said, "You know what?
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:57.760]   The Bible is true and the Bible is clear, and where the Bible is clear,
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:00.880]   we need to believe it and love it and proclaim it on Sunday mornings."
[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:05.200]   And then we need to seek out ministries that believe it too and support them, because
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:11.280]   the pressure to compromise what the Bible makes clear, that pressure is all around us, as Pastor John talked about a moment ago.
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:15.060]   If you believe Desiring God is standing firm on the truths of Scripture,
[00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:19.040]   would you consider joining Rachel to become a monthly ministry partner with us?
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:24.240]   Much of our financial support comes from folks who give on average $30 a month.
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:32.320]   To set up monthly giving, go to give.desiringgod.org. That's give.desiringgod.org.
[00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:38.580]   Always appreciated. I'm your host Tony Rehnke, Pastor John and I return on Monday. We'll see you then.
[00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:41.540]   You
[00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:43.540]   You
[00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:53.540]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
