[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320]   - Hello, it's Sam from Financial Samurai
[00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.720]   and long time no speak.
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.240]   Thought we'd talk about some random things
[00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.200]   this December 2020, the year's almost over
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.920]   and I've got my wife here, Sydney, with me.
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.240]   - Hello, everybody.
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.400]   - So, how did you enjoy our dinner
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.160]   at the French Laundry the other week?
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.200]   - Oh, it was incredible.
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.600]   - Was it amaze-ball?
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.800]   It was like unbelievable, right?
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.920]   Did you see Gavin?
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:24.760]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.880]   - You know, it wasn't just 12 people,
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.920]   it was like 22 people.
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:28.760]   That was pretty cool.
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.600]   And then, you know, the next day,
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.720]   our San Francisco mayor, London Breed,
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.560]   was out there celebrating a birthday with eight people.
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.280]   - Oh, yeah, yeah, we were there for that, too.
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.920]   - Oh, yeah, that was sweet.
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.440]   You know, it was like, you know how they say
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.600]   it's only $350 a head?
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.400]   I mean, it was more like, come on, $1,200 a head.
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.080]   - Right, and we had our kids there, too, right?
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.760]   - We had the kids.
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.680]   And yeah, it was the socialites,
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.720]   basically the father of the socialite
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.400]   is a billionaire in China.
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.240]   And so, you know what?
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.360]   You know, politicians, money, power,
[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.240]   they all come together.
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.840]   And where do you think this culture all starts out?
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.720]   - Maybe it starts at preschool?
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.240]   - Oh, yeah, you mean all those preschools
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.880]   that we got rejected to?
[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:14.720]   - Probably.
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.000]   - Man, we just didn't fit.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.360]   We didn't fit the mold.
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.880]   You know, this is one of the problems
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.800]   with not having day jobs
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.320]   and not really being LinkedInable or anything.
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.520]   You know, when they look us up, they see nothing.
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.040]   - They're lost, right?
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.560]   - I mean, I guess.
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.120]   You know, I was thinking one of the good things
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.520]   about the pandemic is that since we got rejected
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.440]   from six of these preschools,
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.200]   and we got into one, but we pulled them out.
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.920]   But anyway, we got rejected by six of these top preschools
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.280]   and given this pandemic,
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.360]   we wouldn't have sent our kids to the school anyway, right?
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.200]   - I don't think so.
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.280]   I wouldn't have wanted to send them
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.600]   in the middle of the pandemic.
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.120]   I would feel silly.
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.360]   - Yeah, I mean, like why bother?
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.200]   Like we're both--
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.440]   - Because we have the option and the flexibility.
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.280]   - Right.
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.920]   So I mean, if we had day jobs
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.160]   or we had to work, you know, whatever,
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.280]   eight, nine hours a day, probably,
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.640]   or maybe we'd send him back.
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:11.960]   So the good thing about the pandemic again
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.680]   is that a lot of these preschools were shut down
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.160]   for several months.
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.880]   And so we were kind of all equal.
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.120]   But they're all back in session now.
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.960]   - A lot of them, yeah.
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:22.800]   - A lot of them are.
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.720]   And well, we wouldn't have gone anyway.
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.280]   So it is what it is.
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.800]   We're gonna try again in 2021.
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.560]   And we'll find out whether we get into anywhere
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.440]   in the spring of 2021.
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.440]   So it feels like the year has gone by quicker now.
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.280]   Don't you think?
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.280]   - So fast.
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.120]   - So fast, right?
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.360]   Our daughter is gonna be one years old in December.
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.320]   And it's kind of happy sad.
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.280]   Happy that she's grown and progressed so much,
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.520]   but sad that she's no longer a baby.
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.160]   - I know, it's gone too fast for me.
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.480]   Which I guess in a pandemic is a good thing, right?
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.960]   Because I know some people have really been struggling
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:01.840]   during this pandemic.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.640]   It's been hard for everybody.
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.120]   - I mean, we were struggling too.
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.280]   - Some people more than others for sure.
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:13.520]   And I think all of us are itching to go back to normal
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.840]   or pre-pandemic normal.
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:16.920]   - Semi-normal life.
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.800]   - Yeah, and so in that regard,
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.760]   I guess it's good that time has gone fast
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.960]   that we haven't had too hard of a time.
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.520]   - Yeah, although you probably have had
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.880]   maybe a relatively easier time than I have
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.200]   because I'm more of a extrovert.
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.880]   So I like to go out more,
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.840]   hang out with people more and do stuff.
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.640]   And so it kind of, being at home all day.
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.000]   - Wasn't that new for me
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.840]   because I was kind of already doing that
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.640]   while I was pregnant and not that mobile
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.120]   and not feeling that well.
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.160]   I was home a lot already.
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.040]   - Right, you're home more often than I was.
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.440]   But I've been used to being at home obviously since 2012,
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.400]   since I left the work.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.240]   - Right.
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.680]   - So what do you think about the vaccine?
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.800]   Do you think you're gonna take it?
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.880]   Are you happy that you're not gonna be one of the first
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.680]   three or four stages to take it?
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.520]   - I think it's fantastic that they've come so far
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.000]   and that it sounds like things are going well.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   I think the UK approved the Pfizer vaccine this morning.
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.840]   So I think it's great that we get the first responders,
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.520]   the people who need it the most first.
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.360]   - The doctors, yeah.
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.840]   - The doctors, the people over 65
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.880]   or who have preexisting medical conditions.
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.840]   I'm not in a rush to get the vaccine,
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.600]   I think because I don't feel I need it
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.640]   that urgently by any means.
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.640]   So I think the people who need it should get it first.
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:50.480]   - For sure.
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.040]   - And the way to look at it is you're like the last bucket
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.880]   to get the vaccine.
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:54.700]   - Right.
[00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.320]   - Is that every person who does get the vaccine
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.840]   helps increase herd immunity, right?
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:01.680]   - I would think so, yeah.
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.640]   - Helps protect the people who don't
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.160]   or who haven't gotten it yet.
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.000]   - Right.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.400]   - And I think, yeah, who knows exactly for sure
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.000]   how effective it is.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.400]   It's been rushed through the system
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.840]   although there's been plenty of trials.
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.440]   So I don't know, I don't think I'm in a rush
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.480]   to get it either actually.
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.400]   I'm happy to wait my turn
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.120]   which sounds like it'll be in April or May
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.140]   and then just try to stay safe during the winter
[00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:30.800]   because last winter we all got sick.
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:31.640]   - Yep.
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:35.760]   - And in retrospect, I'm hoping that we all got COVID
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.440]   because that would mean that we have some antibodies now
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:39.280]   but who knows?
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.800]   - Yeah, we just don't know.
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.880]   - We just don't know, we just don't know.
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.720]   So how was November?
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.400]   How was Thanksgiving and Halloween?
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.200]   - Thanksgiving and Halloween were fun.
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.880]   I really love celebrating the holidays with our family
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.520]   and Thanksgiving this year, I really tried to help our son
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.200]   understand what it means to be thankful.
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.360]   I think now that he's three and a half,
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.440]   it's really a good time to help instill
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.000]   some good values in him.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.440]   It's challenging 'cause he doesn't have
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.200]   a very long attention span
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.040]   and he's always silly and whatnot
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:17.080]   but I think he really started to grasp
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.440]   what it means to be thankful.
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.280]   - Yeah.
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.880]   - So that felt good.
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:21.840]   - Well, that's good.
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.880]   And I'm actually wondering for all you listeners out there
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.560]   with sons and daughters,
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.880]   whether boys are harder to raise than girls.
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:33.320]   It seems so far that it's been easier to raise our daughter
[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:37.040]   in the infancy stage and I'm not sure whether it's because
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.520]   she has a easier going personality
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.880]   or because she's younger and she hasn't got to
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.200]   the terrible twos and three major years yet
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.000]   or whether we're more confident parents.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.040]   What do you think?
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.840]   - I think it's a mixture of a lot of different things.
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.520]   I think it personality is part of it for sure.
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.160]   I think we're also much more relaxed
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.440]   second time as second time parents.
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:00.280]   - Right.
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:04.320]   - And she naturally has had to learn to be patient
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:09.320]   from day one because we've got her brother to juggle.
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:13.340]   And one of the things we talked about before she was born
[00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:17.180]   is making sure that he didn't build a resentment
[00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:18.620]   towards her.
[00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:22.500]   So we wanted, let's say both of them were crying,
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:26.020]   we wanted to be able to approach our son first
[00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:30.180]   since he is more aware of what's going on
[00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:31.340]   and can remember, yeah.
[00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:34.500]   And to help address his needs.
[00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:35.420]   - First, yeah.
[00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:38.880]   - And then get to her, not say we're gonna ignore her
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:42.020]   obviously if she's in some urgent situation,
[00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:47.020]   but we wanted to kind of help her learn to be patient
[00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:51.820]   and also make sure his needs are getting addressed.
[00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:54.100]   - So do you think it's easier or harder
[00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:56.220]   to raise a girl than a boy?
[00:07:56.220 --> 00:08:02.100]   - Well, I mean, just, I don't know if it has to do
[00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:05.180]   with gender or if it just has to do with personality,
[00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:09.380]   but she just seems more calm than he was as a baby.
[00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:14.380]   He was much more spunky and feisty, I guess.
[00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:16.780]   - I think the word is feisty.
[00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:17.620]   - Feisty.
[00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:18.440]   - 'Cause she's pretty spunky too.
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:19.700]   - Yeah, she's a little, yeah.
[00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:21.780]   He was quite feisty.
[00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:22.620]   - Right.
[00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:24.620]   So I'd love to hear from all of you listeners
[00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:26.460]   who have sons and daughters,
[00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:28.700]   whether you think raising a boy is easier
[00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:31.140]   or a daughter in the initial stages.
[00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:32.620]   I've heard consistent feedback
[00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:36.100]   that raising a boy is harder initially
[00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:38.660]   and then easier as he gets older.
[00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:40.860]   And for girls, it's the exact opposite
[00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:43.860]   where raising girls is easier when they're younger
[00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:47.140]   and it becomes more difficult as they get older.
[00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:48.300]   What are your thoughts?
[00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:51.700]   - I think so.
[00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:53.860]   Just based on my own experience,
[00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:57.380]   I know I was a lot closer with both my parents
[00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:01.100]   when I was young and I was very moody as a teenager.
[00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:02.220]   - Why were you so moody?
[00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:04.020]   - I didn't get into trouble,
[00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:05.820]   but I remember being very moody
[00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:09.380]   and I think it's just from hormones and all that stuff.
[00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:10.220]   - Is that right?
[00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:14.020]   - So my mother and I clashed a lot in my teenage years
[00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:16.860]   'cause I just remember I was grouchy all the time.
[00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:18.380]   (laughing)
[00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:19.780]   - Yeah, moody and grouchy,
[00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:21.740]   these are like a couple of traits
[00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:25.700]   that are probably gonna keep on coming up over time.
[00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:29.180]   It's weird because I don't think I'm really grouchy or moody.
[00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:31.060]   I mean, if I'm starving
[00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:33.660]   and something's not going smoothly as planned,
[00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:35.100]   I'll probably get a little grouchy.
[00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:37.060]   - Right, I think you're pretty even keeled.
[00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:38.940]   - You're pretty even keeled as well.
[00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:39.780]   - Yeah.
[00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:41.620]   - Well, so it is kind of interesting
[00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:44.220]   if you don't have kids now and you have kids,
[00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:47.300]   you're gonna have some pretty moody and grouchy
[00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:50.740]   years ahead of you, which you just have to get used to.
[00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:52.580]   So let's switch over to the future.
[00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:55.100]   How are you feeling about 2021?
[00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:57.460]   - I think I'm feeling pretty good about it
[00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:00.340]   since the vaccine progress has been good
[00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:03.700]   and I think we've done a pretty good job
[00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:07.380]   of getting used to the current normal per se.
[00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:10.860]   So I think with vaccines coming out,
[00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:12.860]   I think things should only get better.
[00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:14.380]   - Yeah, I guess you're right.
[00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:18.220]   I mean, after 10 months of the pandemic,
[00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:21.540]   lockdowns, just being cautious,
[00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:24.380]   anything seems like an upside.
[00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:28.500]   - Yeah, and I also try not to watch the news too much
[00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:31.820]   'cause I feel like mainstream media loves--
[00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:33.020]   - Loves doom.
[00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:37.340]   - Doom and gloom and fear and all that stuff.
[00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:40.580]   So I don't read the news too much
[00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:45.580]   because it's just, it's too depressing and too disturbing.
[00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:51.620]   I think we all benefit more from positive thinking.
[00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:54.300]   - Now, that's something that I've been trying to do
[00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:57.020]   in the newsletters is to stay positive,
[00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:58.220]   to focus on the positives,
[00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:00.420]   because you can look at both sides of the situation
[00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:03.900]   all the time and why just focus on the negative,
[00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:04.900]   focus on the positive.
[00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:08.660]   So if you have gotten sick, for example,
[00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:11.140]   in November, like our son got sick,
[00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:14.580]   well, the positive is that hopefully
[00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:17.220]   that will boost his immunity system going forward
[00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:19.580]   for this winter, because for nine months,
[00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:21.860]   he wasn't exposed to anything really.
[00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:23.220]   And then I think when we brought him back
[00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:25.820]   to the science museum, the viral load
[00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:28.580]   or the bacterial load or whatever kind of overwhelmed him.
[00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:30.620]   So he was sick and he wasn't sick for long.
[00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:32.060]   It was like four or five days.
[00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:34.780]   - Yeah, he was actually in great spirits
[00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:38.580]   considering he kept saying, "Oh, I'm fine."
[00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:40.820]   Even though he still had a runny nose and whatever.
[00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:45.380]   So I was glad that it didn't affect his spirit
[00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:50.380]   or his mood that much, even though he had his symptoms.
[00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:53.500]   - So a pessimist would say, "Oh, he got sick.
[00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:57.500]   "Maybe he got COVID and that's a terrible time
[00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:58.340]   "for five days."
[00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:00.540]   And an optimist, I look at it optimistically
[00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:03.340]   and say, "Look, he needs to build his immune system."
[00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:04.500]   That's kind of one of the benefits
[00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:06.060]   of going to preschool, getting sick,
[00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:07.380]   hopefully not getting terribly sick,
[00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:09.860]   but getting sick enough where you just kind of
[00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:12.220]   build your immunity over time.
[00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:15.700]   So I feel like, okay, he wasn't sick for nine months,
[00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:18.700]   whereas in preschool, he was off and on sick for--
[00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:19.780]   - Every three weeks.
[00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:22.020]   - Every three weeks, it was crazy.
[00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:23.900]   So I feel like this is a great way
[00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:26.100]   for us to build our immunity once again.
[00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:26.940]   - Yeah.
[00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:29.340]   - So for 2021, I'm positive.
[00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:31.740]   I have max allocation.
[00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:34.660]   Well, we have max allocation to equities.
[00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:38.420]   We're also very highly allocated towards real estate.
[00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:40.700]   And I wanna be buying the dip.
[00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:42.780]   I wanna be buying the dip every time the S&P 500
[00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:45.340]   goes down by over 1%.
[00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:47.300]   At the end of the day, we've got at least
[00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:51.340]   two highly efficacious vaccines.
[00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:52.540]   You know, like the measles vaccine?
[00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:53.660]   There's no more measles.
[00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:57.500]   And that's because the vaccine has a 97% efficacy.
[00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:00.420]   That's something to think about when you're hearing
[00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:04.660]   Moderna and Pfizer have a 95% efficacy.
[00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:07.020]   That's unbelievable.
[00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:08.780]   We've got a supportive Fed.
[00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:12.060]   So the Fed futures market has indicated
[00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:14.420]   that the Fed funds rate will stay
[00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:18.740]   at zero to 0.125% for years.
[00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:22.140]   I mean, we're talking 2024, 2025.
[00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:24.620]   I mean, so with interest rates this low,
[00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:27.140]   I mean, we've got a floor on interest rates,
[00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:28.580]   or maybe it's a ceiling on interest rates
[00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:30.380]   that aren't gonna go higher for a while.
[00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:34.060]   So you should continue to see strong borrowing
[00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:37.180]   across consumer debt, mortgage debt, all that.
[00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:39.380]   That should help support the economy.
[00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:43.820]   - In addition, you're seeing the S&P 500 dividend yield
[00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:46.540]   much higher than the 10-year bond yield.
[00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:48.420]   Although the 10-year bond yield, watch out, folks,
[00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:50.300]   it's creeping back to 1%.
[00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:52.660]   Today, it's about 0.95%.
[00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:54.260]   So obviously higher interest rates
[00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:57.020]   mean higher borrowing costs.
[00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:01.460]   And also it means that equities are less attractive
[00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:03.260]   relatively than it was before, right?
[00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.460]   So the ratio of the S&P 500 dividend yield
[00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:08.940]   to the 10-year bond yield has declined.
[00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:13.420]   It hit a peak of about 3.15 in April, March, April 2020.
[00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:17.700]   And now it's only, actually it's only around two now.
[00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:22.340]   But anything above one is a relatively bullish indicator.
[00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:25.540]   I'm also really excited about big city living again.
[00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:27.580]   And that's why we're looking for opportunities
[00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:30.620]   to purchase real estate in places like San Francisco
[00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:31.720]   and New York City.
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:36.140]   I really believe it's gonna be a rush back to the cities
[00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:38.580]   because that is where the network effects are.
[00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:42.780]   That is where the opportunities to land your good gig is.
[00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:45.540]   And that's just the way it's always been.
[00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:46.660]   We've gone through,
[00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:50.540]   I remember living in San Francisco in 2001,
[00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:52.260]   right after the dot-com bubble.
[00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.740]   It was dead for, I don't know, a year or two, two years.
[00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:57.700]   I remember the restaurants were really quiet
[00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:01.820]   and then boom, shakalaka, everything came back.
[00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:05.980]   And it was kind of similar in 2008, 2009, 2010,
[00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:10.460]   not as bad as I think the 2001 dot-com bubble.
[00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:13.300]   So it's just the same thing over and over again.
[00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:16.460]   And you just can't fight human nature.
[00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:19.900]   But temporarily, I think it's really nice
[00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:23.420]   to have more space and less traffic.
[00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:25.060]   Finally, I just wanna talk a little bit
[00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:27.000]   about Financial Samurai.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.100]   It's been over 11 and a half years
[00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:30.640]   since we started the site.
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:33.500]   And I'm getting kind of tired.
[00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:34.340]   I really am.
[00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:37.220]   I mean, I think 2020 has really
[00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:39.780]   kind of beaten up a lot of people.
[00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:43.460]   And I'm proud that there has never been a week missed
[00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:45.720]   during the pandemic when there hasn't been
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:48.220]   three posts published a week
[00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:51.500]   or a newsletter published on average every week.
[00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:53.180]   I'm tired.
[00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:54.980]   I mean, are there some things in 2021
[00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:58.260]   you wanna downshift a little bit?
[00:15:58.260 --> 00:15:59.680]   - For me, not really.
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:02.980]   I've actually enjoyed getting back to work this year,
[00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:04.920]   albeit part-time.
[00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:07.620]   I'm hoping to continue that and actually get--
[00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:08.900]   - Oh, you got a job?
[00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:09.740]   - What?
[00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:11.420]   - Wait, wait, wait, you're gonna get a part-time job?
[00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:14.340]   - No, I'm talking about working on FS.
[00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:16.020]   - Oh, okay.
[00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:16.860]   - Come on.
[00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:18.300]   - I thought I was gonna finally convince you
[00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:20.580]   to go back to work so we can get healthcare benefits
[00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:22.020]   and make some big bucks.
[00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:25.700]   - I am back to work on our family business.
[00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:26.700]   - Oh.
[00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:28.300]   - I love our family business.
[00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:32.040]   And I'm gonna continue to do more.
[00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:35.140]   I really like having a good balance
[00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:37.460]   between family and work.
[00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:41.820]   And it's challenging sometimes being at home with the kids.
[00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:43.860]   Like our son will come up and be like,
[00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:45.140]   "Mommy, I miss you,"
[00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:47.380]   like right when I'm in the middle of something.
[00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:50.440]   So it's easy to get distracted,
[00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:53.340]   but I am using the evenings more
[00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:55.460]   after the kids are asleep
[00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:58.860]   and especially the mornings to try and get more things done.
[00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:00.500]   And I'm having a good time
[00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:03.100]   and I wanna take more off of your plate.
[00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:04.060]   - Okay, well, good.
[00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:06.460]   So that means in 2021,
[00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:08.140]   I'm gonna check out more.
[00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:08.980]   - Yeah.
[00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:09.800]   - Okay, good.
[00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:10.940]   Just take it easier.
[00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:11.860]   - Yeah.
[00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:14.460]   - Joe Biden, sounds like he's gonna be president.
[00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:16.660]   So maybe taxes will be raised.
[00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:20.380]   Maybe there'll be more healthcare subsidies for more people.
[00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:21.220]   I don't know.
[00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:22.060]   - Yeah, I don't know.
[00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:24.740]   - Maybe we can just kick back a little bit more.
[00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:26.660]   - Well, we are saving some money
[00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:28.540]   on our health insurance in 2021.
[00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:29.380]   - Oh yeah.
[00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:31.660]   - Because we did go down a plan.
[00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:33.420]   So hopefully we'll all stay healthy
[00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:35.620]   and then we'll be able to benefit
[00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:37.380]   from a cheaper plan.
[00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:40.060]   - Right, by like $300 a month, right?
[00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:40.900]   - Yeah, something like that.
[00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:42.500]   - Yeah, I mean, better than a poke in the eye.
[00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:46.580]   $300, well, actually that can't buy you one meal
[00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:47.660]   at French Laundry.
[00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:49.540]   (laughing)
[00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:51.340]   I mean, it can buy you like 80%,
[00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:54.060]   no, maybe 60% of one person's meal.
[00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:56.500]   - Okay, so like one little morsel.
[00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:57.620]   - Of corn.
[00:17:57.620 --> 00:17:58.460]   - Yeah.
[00:17:58.460 --> 00:17:59.540]   (laughing)
[00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:01.380]   - Okay, so there you have it folks.
[00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:05.220]   In 2021, I'm gonna fade into the background.
[00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:07.540]   My wife's gonna take over.
[00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:09.060]   I'm gonna do more childcare, obviously,
[00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:12.820]   'cause we gotta be balanced and have an equal opportunity
[00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:15.160]   and equal duty household.
[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:16.660]   So that's it.
[00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:17.780]   - All right, thanks everybody.
[00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:18.620]   Happy holidays.
[00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:19.920]   - Happy holidays.
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:21.940]   I'm not sure if we're gonna record more.
[00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:23.440]   We're just trying to take it easier
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:26.820]   for the last 25 days of the year.
[00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:30.180]   Maybe get our mental health and physical health up to par.
[00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:31.780]   'Cause it's not over yet.
[00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:34.020]   We can still complete our goals that we set out
[00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:36.180]   for at the beginning of the year.
[00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:38.980]   - I like to get excited about thinking about new goals,
[00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:42.180]   but it's important not to forget the goals
[00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:44.540]   that we set for this year that we haven't completed.
[00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:47.180]   - Our new goals, let's see,
[00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:50.860]   new goal is to review our old goals and complete them.
[00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:53.500]   All right guys, I hope everyone is well.
[00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:55.980]   And if you enjoyed this podcast,
[00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:58.020]   please subscribe, leave a positive review,
[00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:00.620]   'cause we're not getting paid
[00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:02.640]   and there's not a lot of motivation
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:04.600]   to spend too much time on these podcasts
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:07.520]   because we're so tired and we have so much to do.
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:10.880]   So any positive comments are motivating
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.420]   and any negative comments are like,
[00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:15.400]   oh, okay, let's just take it easy.
[00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:16.240]   Take care guys.
