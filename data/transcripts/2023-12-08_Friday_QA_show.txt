[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.780]   The holidays start here at Ralph's, with a variety of options to celebrate traditions
[00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:06.060]   old and new.
[00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.860]   You could do a classic herb roasted turkey, or spice it up and make turkey tacos.
[00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.560]   Serve up a go-to shrimp cocktail, or use Simple Truth wild-caught shrimp for your first Cajun
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.560]   risotto.
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.620]   Make creamy mac and cheese, or a spinach artichoke fondue from our selection of Murray's cheese.
[00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.700]   No matter how you shop, Ralph's has all the freshest ingredients to embrace all your
[00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.420]   holiday traditions, Ralph's, fresh for everyone.
[00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.420]   It's Friday, and that means live Q&A.
[00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:51.880]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.580]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while
[00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.340]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.340]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.340]   I am your host.
[00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.340]   Today is Friday, December 8, 2023.
[00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:05.340]   Almost to the end of the year.
[00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:10.740]   I hope that you are on track for any last minute goal accomplishment here at the end
[00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.580]   of the year, and I hope that your 2024 planning is well underway.
[00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:25.060]   Here at Radical Personal Finance, each and every Friday in which I can arrange the appropriate
[00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.540]   recording technology, we record a live Q&A show.
[00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.140]   It works just like call-in talk radio.
[00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.080]   You call in, talk about anything you want, ask any questions, raise any topics, give
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.700]   me any feedback, argue with me.
[00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:35.700]   I love it.
[00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.020]   I wish some of you guys would call in and argue with me.
[00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.020]   I love a good argument.
[00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.100]   I don't get enough of it.
[00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.100]   You guys are very kind.
[00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.080]   If you would like to join me on one of these Friday Q&A shows, you can do that by becoming
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.080]   a patron of the show.
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.620]   You go to patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance, patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance, sign up
[00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.740]   to support the show on Patreon, and that will gain access for you to one of these Friday
[00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.020]   Q&A shows.
[00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.420]   So I welcome your presence next week.
[00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.860]   Today we begin with Annette in North Carolina.
[00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:02.860]   Annette, welcome to the show.
[00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:03.860]   How can I serve you today?
[00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.100]   Joshua, and I appreciate you taking my call.
[00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.900]   You have worked extensively with your children on foreign language.
[00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.980]   Can you recommend two to three Spanish resources for a 10th grader?
[00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.340]   At what level is the 10th grader currently?
[00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.260]   The first level.
[00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.740]   So total new beginner?
[00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:26.740]   New beginner.
[00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:27.740]   Yes.
[00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.300]   So I'll give you three.
[00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:42.940]   The first thing I would begin with is by going to the website refold.la.
[00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:49.860]   It's refold.la.
[00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:58.220]   That website is a project of a team of guys that basically have put together their most
[00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:07.380]   comprehensive start to how do you learn a language with major excellence.
[00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.380]   The only one that I remember the name of, it was started by Matt versus Japan who achieved
[00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.980]   a very high level of Japanese, doing all Japanese all the time, and he's been very popular in
[00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:16.980]   those circles.
[00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.420]   He had a previous company that he did.
[00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:19.420]   He moved to Refold.
[00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.300]   I think he's still involved, but I'm not sure, et cetera.
[00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:27.180]   There is a comprehensive guide at refold.la that is interesting to read.
[00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:33.400]   It's probably the best single source of how to learn a language completely all the way
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.780]   through starting from nothing.
[00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:42.260]   The guys that coordinate that are focused on developing a very high level of fluency.
[00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.220]   So they're not just trying to get through a high school class.
[00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.340]   So the guide is useful.
[00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:54.180]   However, the resource that I'm recommending to you is the vocabulary deck that they sell
[00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.380]   for Anki.
[00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:05.060]   They have a vocabulary deck that is called ES1K, Spanish 1,000, the Espanol 1,000.
[00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.940]   ES1K vocabulary deck.
[00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:16.340]   And what they have done is they have created a 1,000 word deck of flashcards for Spanish
[00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:23.220]   that takes away all of the cognates, so the obvious easy words that are the same in Spanish
[00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:30.140]   and English, but just pronounced similar, and they've used the highest frequency vocabulary.
[00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:37.300]   They've turned those into Anki flashcards for the free program Anki, and those flashcards
[00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:44.460]   feature the word in Spanish, the word in English, an audio reading of the word by a native speaker,
[00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:53.980]   as well as a sentence of the audio speaker, reader of the word, just simply reading that
[00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:54.980]   sentence.
[00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.100]   I think they charge, I don't know, 20 bucks, something like that for it, but it is an ideal
[00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.900]   first set of flashcards to learn for the Spanish language.
[00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.060]   They have it for about a half a dozen languages, Spanish is one of the ones that they include.
[00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.460]   Because really, until you get 1,000 words under your belt, one of the first things you
[00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.060]   want to just do is study and learn 1,000 words as quickly as possible.
[00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:22.140]   To be clear, you're only trying to recognize the word when you hear it in the foreign language.
[00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:28.180]   But doing flashcard word study is a really great way to get started with language acquisition,
[00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.580]   and that's the best resource that I know of.
[00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:35.940]   Ideally, this would go on your 10th grade student's phone or mobile device, and would
[00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.900]   allow basically micro study sessions.
[00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:44.580]   What I would try to see him or her do would be to spend 10 minutes in the morning, 10
[00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.460]   minutes at noon, 10 minutes in the evening just doing some flashcards on Anki.
[00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.380]   You want to be able to recognize those 1,000 words as quickly as possible.
[00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:59.100]   Now, concurrent with this, the second resource I would suggest is on YouTube.
[00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:05.980]   There is a YouTube channel, and it's also a Patreon page called Ayon Academy, A-Y-A-N,
[00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:07.900]   Ayon Academy.
[00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:14.900]   If you go to Ayon Academy and look for Spanish, you will find that they have a number of books
[00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.900]   available.
[00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:24.620]   They have Poco a Poco, they have Learn Spanish by the Natural Method, Poco a Poco, they have
[00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.300]   several other Spanish courses.
[00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:33.860]   If you sign up for their – the first ones are free on YouTube.
[00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:39.620]   It looks like they have about 40 – excuse me, it looks like they have about 20 or so
[00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:43.440]   of their videos for Poco a Poco for free on YouTube.
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.840]   But you'll sign up for their Patreon page, it's pretty inexpensive, and then you get
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.460]   audio reading of that.
[00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:54.860]   You can download the Poco a Poco book, and what this is is this is a natural method book.
[00:06:54.860 --> 00:07:00.380]   And a natural method means basically how can we create a story that is so simple and so
[00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:07.220]   straightforward that even somebody who has very little exposure to the language can understand
[00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:09.580]   it right from the very beginning.
[00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:14.500]   And I think this is a really good way to start because it allows you to get quick exposure
[00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.580]   to a lot of vocabulary in a very straightforward way.
[00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:21.420]   And so you can download for free the Poco a Poco book and their other Spanish courses.
[00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:26.860]   They have probably two or three of them available on their Patreon page, and then you can listen
[00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:27.860]   to the audio.
[00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:31.140]   So I would spend some time doing that as well.
[00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:38.820]   Then the third resource that I would use for a 10th grader is I would sign up for the website
[00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:47.300]   link, l-i-n-g-q.com, link.com, and I would start going through their link mini stories.
[00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:52.420]   And this you do on a computer or on a mobile device, and you read through the stories.
[00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:57.260]   And the way you do it is you start with a mini story, and then you read through it using
[00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.660]   a feature in that program that's called sentence mode.
[00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:03.740]   And you need to learn how to use the program and mark the words that you know and don't
[00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:04.740]   know.
[00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:08.060]   But go through their initial mini stories as a good starting point.
[00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:12.420]   And what you can do, the benefit of that, is that these stories are simple.
[00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:15.600]   The stories themselves are about two minutes per story.
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:19.740]   And what they do is they have a very simple story, and it takes about two minutes.
[00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:24.380]   The first time it's done in first person, so, excuse me, the first time it's done in
[00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:25.720]   the third person.
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:30.580]   So I think the first one is like Marcus wakes up in the morning, Marcus has a cup of coffee,
[00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:34.540]   then he drives to work in his car, et cetera, he's a cook in a restaurant.
[00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:37.620]   And so it does this little two-minute story in the third person.
[00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:40.780]   And it repeats the exact same story in the first person.
[00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:47.260]   So my name is Marcus, I wake up in the morning at six o'clock, I have a cup of coffee before
[00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.420]   I go to work, I drive my car to work, et cetera.
[00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:51.020]   So it does it in the first person.
[00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:54.940]   And then it takes about three minutes of questioning about the story.
[00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:57.860]   And the questions are basically another form of repetition.
[00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:00.820]   So is Marcus a cook in a restaurant?
[00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:02.460]   Yes, Marcus is a cook in a restaurant.
[00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:03.620]   Does Marcus wake up early?
[00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:06.220]   Yes, Marcus wakes up at six o'clock in the morning.
[00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:09.020]   Does Marcus drive to work in his car or does he take the bus?
[00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:10.460]   Marcus drives to work in his car.
[00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:16.700]   And they're super, super repetitive, but the story format is a really good way of understanding
[00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:17.940]   the language.
[00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:25.140]   And so if you start with those three resources, then in the course of a couple to four weeks,
[00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:30.180]   like basically less than a month, very quickly your learner should acquire a couple thousand
[00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:33.540]   words of Spanish vocabulary.
[00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:41.620]   And at that point in time, it's very simple to go directly to native language content,
[00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:46.900]   very directly to native language, sorry, native speaker content, hopefully that is leveled
[00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:49.300]   or that you can level in some way.
[00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:53.220]   And then it's just a matter of choosing resources that are a good fit for the student.
[00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:56.060]   So if the student, it's really good to spend a lot of time listening.
[00:09:56.060 --> 00:10:01.820]   So if the student is into TV shows, he or she likes to watch TV or soap operas or something
[00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:05.740]   like that, you look for things on Netflix and you listen to those, or you look for YouTube
[00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:06.740]   series.
[00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:10.740]   If the student is a reader and is willing to read, you do lots of reading.
[00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:18.060]   And as quickly as possible, you try to get to things that are interesting to the student
[00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:23.820]   based upon the subject matter.
[00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:29.940]   And so depending on the motivation of the student, I would say one to two, maybe three
[00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:36.220]   months maximum, you could consume all of those resources, the 60 mini stories, the Poco a
[00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:41.700]   Poco book, and learn the thousand flashcards, and you're fully ready for native language
[00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:42.740]   material.
[00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:47.700]   And then you'll just want to put in some crutches that will help the student to, excuse me,
[00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:50.780]   native speaker material, that you'll want to put in some crutches that will help the
[00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:55.540]   student to use that native speaker material effectively.
[00:10:55.540 --> 00:11:01.420]   So there are a couple of, for example, for TV or YouTube, you can either take the transcripts
[00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:06.260]   from that and you can read them with a dictionary using a program like LingQ, or you can use
[00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:12.820]   a couple of Chrome extensions to automatically show you the subtitles as well as the translation
[00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:14.060]   if you still need translation.
[00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:18.140]   As quickly as possible, you want to get just to native language subtitles underneath it.
[00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:20.340]   For reading, LingQ is the best resource.
[00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:23.540]   There are a couple of other software programs that are free and other people that have kind
[00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:25.520]   of built similar things.
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:30.900]   Or but basically, and then also there's lots and lots of leveled material available for
[00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:32.580]   listening and for reading.
[00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:37.920]   So there are graded readers, there is, you know, Spanish news in slow Spanish or simple
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:40.140]   Spanish podcasts, things like that.
[00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:44.300]   And so you basically use those tools to make it accessible.
[00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:46.100]   And then it's just a matter of ticking up the hours.
[00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:50.620]   And the goal is to get to, with Spanish, an initial goal should be about 650 hours.
[00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:54.100]   The goal is to get 650 hours as quickly as possible.
[00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:59.860]   And so if you can find content that will suck the student in, then you can get to the point
[00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:02.980]   of two to four hours a day would be really great.
[00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:06.780]   And we're not just doing it for, it's not study, you're doing some study, some word
[00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:08.620]   cards, flashcards, etc.
[00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:11.540]   But the study could be limited to about 20-30 minutes.
[00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:15.740]   But if you're getting two to three hours of content exposure using interesting books,
[00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:20.060]   interesting shows, interesting podcasts, interesting YouTube channels, etc., then in three hours
[00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:25.020]   a day, you're at, what, a couple hundred days to get to 650 hours, a few hundred hours to
[00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:26.220]   a few hundred days.
[00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:31.940]   So Spanish to an upper level, intermediate level, basically about a B2, my target would
[00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:35.720]   be getting there in about a year if the student is motivated.
[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:36.720]   But that's how I would do it.
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:39.740]   And those are the three resources I would begin with.
[00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:44.060]   So how do you spell the Anki, is that O-N-K-I or what?
[00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:45.060]   It's A-N-K-I.
[00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:46.060]   Anki.
[00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:47.060]   A-N-K-I.
[00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:48.060]   I've seen it.
[00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:49.060]   Yeah.
[00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:50.060]   I've seen it.
[00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:51.060]   Okay.
[00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:52.060]   Okay.
[00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:53.060]   Thank you.
[00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:54.060]   And have a Merry Christmas.
[00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:55.060]   My pleasure.
[00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:56.060]   We go on to Adele in the state of Texas.
[00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:57.060]   Adele, welcome to the show.
[00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:58.060]   How can I serve you today?
[00:12:58.060 --> 00:12:59.060]   Hi.
[00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:00.060]   Thanks for taking my call.
[00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:09.060]   I have two questions, and I guess I just need to get a second opinion, force of action.
[00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:16.060]   One is, my first question is, my mother passed away and I have a small inheritance coming.
[00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:17.060]   I'm Canadian.
[00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:19.060]   I now live in Idaho.
[00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:26.060]   I have 200,000 Canadians coming my way that needs to be transferred from the executor's
[00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:33.060]   account to me in Idaho, and I'm looking for the cheapest way to transfer money from Canada
[00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:34.060]   to the U.S.
[00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:36.060]   I've done a little research.
[00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:43.060]   It seems like Y might be the best way to go, like an online money transfer service, because
[00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:48.060]   they offer international money transfers at lower rates and better exchange rates and
[00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:50.060]   actual real exchange rates without markup.
[00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:55.340]   But I just wanted to check with you and see your opinion on that.
[00:13:55.340 --> 00:14:00.780]   For that amount of money, I would just do a bank-to-bank transfer using an international
[00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:03.300]   transfer, or Y's is also fine.
[00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:09.540]   I don't see any clear reason why you would choose one or the other, so I would just do
[00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:12.540]   an ACH transfer.
[00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:19.100]   It's relatively simple and arrives in a few days, and generally the fees are pretty reasonable.
[00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:23.300]   And then the other comment would just be, consider just keeping the money in a Canadian
[00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:24.300]   bank account.
[00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:31.420]   Unless you need the money today, etc., then because it's so accessible, it could be worthwhile
[00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:34.500]   just keeping the money in a Canadian bank account, and possibly even in Canadian dollars,
[00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:37.620]   and then just use it when you need to using a debit card.
[00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:40.020]   That would be the other simple solution.
[00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:46.340]   Because the exchange rates are so poor right now for Canadians in the U.S.
[00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:47.900]   You yourself are Canadian.
[00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:50.060]   Do you go back to Canada and visit?
[00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:59.940]   I do, but it's going to become rarer and rarer as I have no more immediate.
[00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:05.500]   The direct answer to your question is, I would just do a wire transfer, an ACH transfer from
[00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:06.820]   bank account to bank account.
[00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:07.820]   That will solve it.
[00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:11.820]   It's done, squared away, just taken care of.
[00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:13.900]   You can use WISE if necessary.
[00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:15.380]   Lots of people love WISE.
[00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:17.620]   It's fine.
[00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:20.340]   So I don't know what the best rates would be with that.
[00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:22.420]   You would have to check that yourself.
[00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:30.980]   But my comment is simply that there are benefits to having different currencies in your portfolio,
[00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:34.580]   and there are benefits to having bank accounts in multiple countries.
[00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:40.980]   So because there are benefits to that, if somebody comes into a situation in which it's
[00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:46.240]   convenient to have a bank account in a friendly country like Canada or in another currency
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:51.260]   like the Canadian dollar, then my only comment is you might consider just keeping it there
[00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:55.100]   in Canada and keeping it in the Canadian dollar.
[00:15:55.100 --> 00:16:01.100]   Now if you have a prediction about the strength or weakness of the Canadian dollar, then of
[00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:03.580]   course you should follow your prediction.
[00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:08.420]   But a lot of times it's useful to have some money that is in another currency even though
[00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:10.940]   the exchange rates fluctuate.
[00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:16.180]   And since it's so easy to have a Canadian bank account, and many Canadians or many people
[00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:21.260]   in Idaho will go to Canada on occasion, then just keep some of it in Canadian dollars.
[00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:25.340]   And if or when you go to Canada, then spend from your Canadian bank account.
[00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:29.940]   And then if you want to spend in the United States, if you have an account that has a
[00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:34.100]   debit card attached to it, you just go to an ATM and you get money out or you just spend
[00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:37.820]   from your Canadian account when it's convenient to do it.
[00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:42.500]   So it all has to do with what is your use of the money.
[00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:46.500]   If you needed this money today to pay off some bills or do something urgent, then of
[00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:48.340]   course that wouldn't be applicable.
[00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:51.420]   But if you're just going to take the money and stick it into a savings account in the
[00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:57.140]   United States, then consider just keeping some of it in Canada for the diversification
[00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:58.140]   benefits.
[00:16:58.140 --> 00:16:59.140]   Gotcha.
[00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:00.140]   Okay.
[00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:01.140]   Thank you.
[00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:02.700]   I mean, that's a good point.
[00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:08.620]   And on that note, my second question is about how to use this money wisely.
[00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:12.860]   The holidays start here at Ralph's with a variety of options to celebrate traditions
[00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:14.140]   old and new.
[00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:18.940]   You could do a classic herb roasted turkey or spice it up and make turkey tacos, serve
[00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:24.620]   up a go-to shrimp cocktail, or use Simple Truth wild-caught shrimp for your first Cajun
[00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:25.620]   risotto.
[00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:29.500]   You could do a creamy mac and cheese or a spinach artichoke fondue from our selection
[00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:30.700]   of Murray's cheese.
[00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:35.620]   No matter how you shop, Ralph's has all the freshest ingredients to embrace all your holiday
[00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:36.620]   traditions.
[00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:37.620]   Ralph's.
[00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:38.620]   Fresh for everyone.
[00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:41.980]   The first thing I want to do is pay off some high-interest debts.
[00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:50.220]   And the second is probably just restock the war chest and have the emergency fund replenished.
[00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:53.820]   The next I'm thinking about doing is maybe investing in some crypto.
[00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:56.980]   I purchased your crypto course.
[00:17:56.980 --> 00:18:01.940]   And then investing in myself, I'm looking at starting a new online business.
[00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:04.260]   Would you have any other advice?
[00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:07.860]   It's not a lot of money, but I want to be smart with it.
[00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:10.940]   What you're describing is the smart way to do it.
[00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:17.060]   So in a perfect world with you and me behaving as perfectly rational persons rather than
[00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:25.700]   emotional humans, coming into a windfall of any kind, meaning an inheritance or an extra
[00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:31.100]   bonus at work or winning a lottery payment or a prize of some kind, ideally we would
[00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:37.140]   always have an itemized list of financial goals pre-established that we've been thinking
[00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:42.300]   about for six months or a year, et cetera, and then we just go down our list of goals.
[00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:48.620]   But of course, we don't do that, but that's the ideal thing.
[00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:49.820]   That would be the ideal thing.
[00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:55.140]   And the reason I pointed out is that I don't think that windfalls should be treated any
[00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:57.300]   differently than anything else.
[00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:02.260]   So what I'm trying to get people to not do by making my funny little joke is not to say,
[00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:03.260]   "Oh, there's a windfall.
[00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:04.260]   Let me go and spend it."
[00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:05.540]   Or, "Hey, here's a windfall.
[00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:11.060]   I have to save this in my mother's honor," or something like that.
[00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:17.860]   Those kinds of emotional things have their place, but ideally the money should just be
[00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:22.100]   a way to move us forward on the board game of life.
[00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:24.500]   Okay, skip forward 15 spaces.
[00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:25.500]   Great.
[00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:27.260]   So what you described, I think, is an ideal order.
[00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:31.900]   So if you have high interest rate debt at the moment, then that would negate everything
[00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:35.220]   I said about keep the money in Canada and stick it in a savings account.
[00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:37.500]   No, pay off the high interest rate debt.
[00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:38.500]   That's a great thing.
[00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:41.900]   If it comes to establishing and kind of beefing up your emergency fund, great.
[00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:43.860]   That's a smart move.
[00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:45.420]   And so definitely beef it up.
[00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:55.980]   You might put most of it into the bank and then keep $3,000 in Canada or something like
[00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:56.980]   that.
[00:19:56.980 --> 00:20:01.340]   By the way, back to the previous question before I continue, just note that your simplest
[00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:07.620]   thing might just simply be to open an account at a Canadian bank and then have a Canadian
[00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:11.060]   dollar account and a U.S. dollar account and then just write your checks out of the U.S.
[00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:12.300]   dollar account.
[00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:17.860]   So you can live in the United States, use a Canadian bank account and just pay off your
[00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:26.660]   debts directly from it, and that will probably give you the best conversion transfer because
[00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:31.100]   you're just converting at the bank itself, just moving it from your Canadian dollar account
[00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:32.580]   to your U.S. dollar account.
[00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:35.700]   So from what you're saying, since you have a bunch of expenses here, that might be the
[00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:37.500]   simplest way to do it as well.
[00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:44.580]   Then in terms of down the list, crypto or Bitcoin specifically or something else, that's
[00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:47.500]   okay if you value what it's for.
[00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:53.540]   But remember that for public record, my course is not about speculating on Bitcoin, etc.
[00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:57.700]   It's a matter of acquiring Bitcoin because you want it and want to use it for the long
[00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:58.700]   term.
[00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:05.300]   So if you have, I don't make predictions in that course or even in general about you're
[00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:06.700]   going to make a fortune with Bitcoin.
[00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:12.100]   So just be clear that if you have other investment opportunities, you should weigh those against
[00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:15.060]   purchasing Bitcoin or any other investment.
[00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:18.700]   And then your best investment is generally going to be into yourself.
[00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:20.420]   That's where you get your highest rate of return.
[00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:26.580]   So if you know of some way to invest into yourself, then you should generally prioritize
[00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:33.060]   that over and above everything that relies on an external market or player, such as Bitcoin
[00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:35.660]   or such as mutual funds, etc.
[00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:38.540]   So I like your list and I think that's a rational list.
[00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:39.540]   Okay.
[00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:41.140]   Thank you so much, Joshua.
[00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:42.140]   I appreciate it.
[00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:43.140]   My pleasure.
[00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:45.780]   We go on to Jordan in New York.
[00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:46.780]   Jordan, welcome to the show.
[00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:47.780]   How can I serve you today?
[00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:48.780]   Hey, thanks so much.
[00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:50.820]   I appreciate you taking the time.
[00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:51.820]   My pleasure.
[00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:52.820]   Okay.
[00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:57.900]   I don't have a super well-formed question, but it certainly goes to the area of real
[00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:58.900]   estate.
[00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:00.940]   I own three investment properties.
[00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:07.100]   I have my salary and my wife's salary combined.
[00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:14.300]   Active income is around $200,000 and I'm not understanding how I properly deduct expenses
[00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:18.180]   from my passive losses against my active income.
[00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:22.540]   And I think I can't do that because I make too much money, in which case I'd like to
[00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:27.300]   understand better where I can benefit from those passive losses down the line.
[00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:37.780]   Passive losses are only deductible to $3,000 per year against other active income.
[00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:42.580]   When you have passive gains and passive losses, you net your passive gains against your passive
[00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:52.380]   losses and you cannot take excess losses against your active income beyond $3,000 per year.
[00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:53.860]   You can bank the loss.
[00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:57.060]   So let's say you have a $50,000 passive loss this year.
[00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:02.300]   You can bank it and take it out $3,000 a year at a time, but you cannot net your passive
[00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:08.140]   losses against your active gains in any way other than the $3,000 limit.
[00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:12.860]   So if I'm experiencing larger passive losses, is there some planning I should do down the
[00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:14.280]   line to benefit from that?
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:16.860]   You can try to turn them into active losses.
[00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:18.660]   That's what you should try to do.
[00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:24.540]   And so in real estate, there are three designations that a real estate investor can have.
[00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:29.660]   That of a passive investor, that of an active investor, and that of a full-time professional.
[00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:35.620]   And so one of the things that some real estate professionals try to do is they try to convert
[00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:41.580]   themselves into that full-time professional status because in that situation, their losses
[00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:48.260]   now become active losses and they can be deductible against other forms of income.
[00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:53.500]   There's a clear test as to what is necessary for you to become a full-time professional.
[00:23:53.500 --> 00:24:00.040]   It is doable, but it's only doable if that's genuinely your actual full-time endeavor.
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:06.020]   And so what works for a lot of people is if you have a husband and a wife team, what many
[00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:11.780]   people will do is let's say the husband has a job or a business or something that's his
[00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:17.580]   primary activity, but the wife becomes a full-time active investor.
[00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:22.740]   And she gets a real estate license, she manages the properties, she racks up the hours, etc.
[00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:28.880]   And that allows them to claim that full-time status and deduct all of their losses against
[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:30.420]   other forms of income.
[00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:31.900]   Got it.
[00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:33.220]   That actually is a great idea.
[00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:37.220]   My wife will be leaving her full-time job when we have a baby in February.
[00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:39.580]   So that is a possibility for next year for sure.
[00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:40.580]   It's a possibility.
[00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:41.580]   Just look up the rules.
[00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:45.700]   I don't have them on the top of my head, but a quick web search will find them for you.
[00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:48.840]   How do I become a full-time active real estate investor?
[00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:53.500]   She needs to be genuinely dedicating a significant amount of time to the real estate business.
[00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:55.040]   That needs to be documented.
[00:24:55.040 --> 00:25:00.180]   This is an area of abuse, and so it's not uncommon to be audited.
[00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:04.060]   So she just needs to document her time, document her training, document her activity, and that
[00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:05.200]   can work out well.
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:11.040]   And I think that that structure is in many cases the most efficient structure for a husband
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:12.640]   and wife to build their wealth.
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:17.060]   You have your job and/or business that is disconnected from the family's investments,
[00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:21.620]   and she spends her time curating and taking care of the family investments.
[00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:25.940]   And that allows you to deduct more of the expenses against your business income.
[00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:30.200]   It allows you to have a very efficient structure, and it allows her to be looking for the big
[00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:33.600]   wins while you create the income and the active income.
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:38.840]   So I like that structure of a husband and wife team very much if she's interested and
[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:39.840]   willing to do it.
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:40.840]   Great.
[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:41.840]   I appreciate that.
[00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:44.060]   Can I ask one more short question?
[00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:45.200]   Go ahead.
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:49.760]   I have, in the past, I've pretty much always prepared my own taxes, or I've had a sort
[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:53.640]   of family friend prepare them, who's been fine, but I think I need something a little
[00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:55.760]   more sophisticated.
[00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:58.360]   Where would you suggest I start with that?
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:05.320]   I, in general, don't think that tax preparation is sophisticated.
[00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:12.720]   So you may want to solicit good tax advice, but there is a difference between tax preparation
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:15.120]   and tax advice.
[00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:22.200]   In general, tax preparation is absurdly easy if you have good records.
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:28.160]   And so if you have good detailed records, and you have carefully documented all of your
[00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:34.400]   transactions, you have your receipts ready, et cetera, then the tax preparer is basically
[00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:36.040]   a functionary.
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:39.780]   He's not really doing anything except putting numbers in the computer.
[00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:43.120]   And you yourself can put those numbers in the computer pretty well.
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:49.560]   So my first question for someone like you is, how good is your bookkeeping?
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:56.400]   Most of your big wins, from tax preparation perspective, come down to your skill with
[00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.400]   bookkeeping.
[00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:58.400]   Do you have receipts?
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:03.320]   Do you have receipts for the $23 that you spent at Home Depot to go and get a replacement
[00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:11.760]   part to fix something at the house, and now you can expense that properly, that $23?
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:17.680]   So if you have that stuff, and you can basically go to your bookkeeping software of choice
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:23.520]   and say, print out my end of year report, then you can pretty much go to just about
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:29.620]   any generic tax preparation software, and you can enter the numbers yourself.
[00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:32.240]   Because that's all your accountant is going to do.
[00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:36.840]   Even if you go to a local accounting office, generally speaking, your accountant is having
[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:42.160]   his interns or his team in India or somebody do that.
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:44.280]   So that's tax preparation.
[00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:50.000]   If you don't have good bookkeeping, then you're going to wind up overpaying on tax preparation,
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.440]   because now your tax accountant is trying to figure out end of year bookkeeping.
[00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:56.800]   And so you should probably fix your bookkeeping issues.
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:28:00.600]   If you need to fix your bookkeeping issues, then fix them with a-- and you don't want
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:02.740]   to do it yourself-- fix them with a bookkeeper.
[00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:08.240]   Just hire a bookkeeper and work with that person separately.
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:10.160]   So now let's flip to tax advice.
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:12.120]   How do you get good tax advice?
[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:16.880]   You may be able to find somebody who specializes in working with real estate investors who
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:19.720]   can give you excellent tax advice.
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:25.880]   I have found that most of the time, your best source of real estate tax advice, though,
[00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:32.720]   will come from another DIY real estate investor who's really into it, and/or just from good
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:35.840]   studying the tax books.
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:41.160]   Tax planning for real estate is fairly simple and fairly straightforward, but it's largely
[00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:49.840]   a matter of understanding the distinctions of how property is categorized, what expenses
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:53.480]   are deductible versus what expenses are depreciable.
[00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:55.680]   And it's pretty straightforward.
[00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:58.760]   It's pretty well documented in books at this point in time.
[00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:06.120]   And so if you just invest in a handful of good books, then you're going to know most
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:09.880]   of what there is to be known about this, especially if you're just doing single family rentals
[00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:11.480]   or just basic stuff.
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:13.120]   There's no secrets out there.
[00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:15.520]   It's just a matter of finding the right reference manuals.
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:19.720]   I would suggest to you John Reed's book, Aggressive Tax Avoidance for Real Estate Investors.
[00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:21.800]   This is probably your best starting point.
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:25.760]   Again, that's John Reed, Aggressive Tax Avoidance for Real Estate Investors.
[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:30.320]   And if you go through that and you're careful about your bookkeeping, you'll have most of
[00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:32.280]   your planning ideas.
[00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:36.520]   And so at the level you're describing, I don't know, unless you find someone in your local
[00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:42.120]   investors club or someone locally who specializes in working with real estate investors, I'm
[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:46.380]   not sure that you even need someone to do that.
[00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:52.760]   The people who really benefit from a very knowledgeable accountant are people who are
[00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:56.880]   using the accountant's bookkeeping services in their business and who find someone who
[00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:02.440]   can do a lot of proactive planning or the people who just need the services of simplifying
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:03.440]   their life.
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:08.520]   I'm not against hiring accountants, but what I have found is that people often have this
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:12.080]   expectation that somehow I'm going to magically hire this accountant and he's going to give
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:13.600]   me all kinds of advice.
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:17.280]   And then the accountant is a functionary who does a great job preparing the tax returns,
[00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:18.280]   et cetera.
[00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:19.280]   And like, well, where was all the advice?
[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:22.040]   Well, you got to do it yourself.
[00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:27.560]   And most, the best, the people who pay the least taxes are those who take an interest
[00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:32.240]   in the subject and educate themselves very detailed in a very careful way about the tax
[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:33.240]   code.
[00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:37.400]   And then once they have that education, they will know more than the accountant about their
[00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:39.440]   specific area.
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:43.480]   It's always this way because a professional has to have a broad range of experience and
[00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:45.600]   a broad range of expertise.
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:47.840]   You only have to have a very narrow range of experience.
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:53.560]   And so your knowledge can actually go much deeper than my knowledge can because you just
[00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:58.360]   have to worry about the specifics of your thing where I have to go and try to absorb
[00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:01.160]   a body of knowledge across a broad basis.
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:06.880]   So how to find a good accountant, barring everything I've just said, I would start by
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:07.880]   asking around.
[00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:11.440]   I would call if you're involved in real estate investment club, I would ask people if they
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:15.840]   know people who are specializing in real estate, and then I would call my wealthy friends and
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:19.380]   I would just simply get a referral and or use another professional.
[00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:22.040]   So professionals are good at referring people around.
[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:25.560]   When I was an insurance agent, I would have referred you to six different accountants
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:28.360]   and done a good job with those referrals.
[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:33.040]   And so call people that you know who are professionals, et cetera, and try to find somebody based
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:34.040]   upon that as well.
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:35.040]   That's a good way to go about it.
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:36.040]   Okay.
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:37.040]   Thank you.
[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:38.040]   That's very helpful.
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:39.040]   I appreciate it.
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:40.040]   My pleasure.
[00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:42.800]   We go on to Jason in Washington, D.C.
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:43.800]   Jason, welcome to the show.
[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:45.800]   Glad to serve you today.
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:46.840]   Hi, Joshua.
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:49.200]   Thank you for taking my call.
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:54.660]   So I wanted to get your input and perspective on our planning here.
[00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:59.880]   So about two years ago, we turned our townhome into a rental home after buying a primary
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:00.880]   home.
[00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:03.540]   So we've had this rental for two years.
[00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:08.840]   It's my understanding that we can sell our rental property without capital gains tax
[00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:12.640]   within the three or five-year rule.
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:17.880]   So I'm looking to get input and perspective from you if we should sell or keep the rental.
[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:23.080]   A little bit of background, we have a property management company managing it for the last
[00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:24.080]   two years.
[00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:26.880]   It has been a very smooth process.
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:31.760]   Not a lot of expenses as far as things going wrong with the property.
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:37.300]   The property is currently income producing roughly about $900 per month after property
[00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:39.200]   management fees.
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:45.360]   We've had about $1,000 worth of fixes in the last, well, each year of things we've had
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:47.320]   to fix.
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:50.280]   And our income is roughly around $240.
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:56.340]   So we haven't really realized any tax benefits from that.
[00:32:56.340 --> 00:33:03.280]   So I'm just swirling around in my head on should we sell to avoid the capital gains
[00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:08.000]   and realize a large sum from selling the property?
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.760]   Is there any additional information I can give you to kind of maybe help?
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:17.640]   If you sold the property, what would you expect the total sales price to be that a buyer would
[00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:21.040]   buy it in today's market?
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:24.600]   It looks like roughly $468,000.
[00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:26.680]   What is your tax basis in the property?
[00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:29.880]   How much did you pay for it?
[00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:32.880]   $235,000.
[00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:39.920]   And do you have any guesses on what you would pay in terms of sales costs, real estate agents,
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:42.960]   et cetera, if you sold it out of the $468,000?
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:52.200]   From my understanding, it's 6%, so let's say 6 to 8%.
[00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:59.760]   So basically, you have an opportunity right now for two things.
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:04.800]   The first thing is – actually, there are three factors that you could consider.
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:05.800]   Let me go to three.
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:12.140]   Number one, the first thing you can consider is simply this particular property.
[00:34:12.140 --> 00:34:18.000]   Is this property a good rental that you would be excited to buy over again?
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:23.960]   Or is this a property that's okay, it's okay, but it's not great?
[00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:28.320]   If you have a property that you – there are properties that are great to live in.
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:30.440]   There are properties that are great as rentals.
[00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:34.760]   And so you just want to ask yourself, would I buy this particular property over again
[00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:35.760]   as a rental?
[00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:42.840]   If it were on the market today for $468,000, would I buy this specific property for $468,000
[00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:48.120]   today as a rental, or is there something that is more compelling?
[00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:55.600]   It may be that in your area, there is a property that you could buy for $468,000 that would
[00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:57.880]   be more compelling as a rental.
[00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:02.840]   And if so, you should always think about getting rid of bad rentals and buying better rentals.
[00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:10.200]   So most real estate investors who have a large portfolio of properties have a few that – this
[00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:12.520]   property just doesn't do that great.
[00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:14.320]   It doesn't rent very easily.
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:17.580]   It's a little awkward or something like that, and they trade those properties out when they
[00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:21.880]   have an opportunity and to sell them and go to somewhere else.
[00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:23.720]   And so that's the first question you should ask.
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:28.320]   The second question you should ask would involve some sense of market timing.
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:32.320]   You look at your local market and you ask yourself, is this a good time for me to be
[00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:35.000]   selling a piece of property, taking some profits?
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:39.680]   Is there something that might change in the local market?
[00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:43.120]   Or is this a good time where, no, I definitely want to keep it because things could change
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:44.120]   in the future?
[00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:49.120]   I'm not going to even open my mouth on that because you have a DC area code phone number,
[00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:53.280]   and it just seems like everything in DC just continues to go up.
[00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:55.920]   But you make your own assessment of that.
[00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:59.200]   Number three is then the tax consideration.
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:06.600]   So you have an opportunity to reset and to go from a $235,000 tax basis, and let's say
[00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:12.720]   you sell the property for $468,000, and let's say you clear $415,000 or $420,000, whatever
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:13.720]   it winds up being.
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:14.840]   So let's just call it for easy math.
[00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:17.640]   Let's say you clear $200,000 tax-free.
[00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:25.000]   Would you rather take advantage of this factor to take your $200,000 tax-free, or is there
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.640]   some compelling reason why you wouldn't want to take the $200,000 tax-free?
[00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:34.120]   Compelling reasons why you wouldn't would be things like, this house is fantastic.
[00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:36.480]   I know that everything on this house is fixed.
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:40.200]   I know that there's not a bit of cost that's going to come out of it.
[00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:44.920]   But I don't necessarily know that about some other place, or just things like that.
[00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:48.080]   Once this three years passes, yeah, you're going to lose the chance to access the money
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:49.080]   tax-free.
[00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:52.200]   And in the future, you would have to pay capital gains taxes.
[00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:58.480]   And so in general, the bias, especially when you've got $200,000-something of gain, general
[00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:02.160]   the bias would be take your tax-free gain.
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:07.060]   And even if you turn around and you sell this property, and you buy literally the property
[00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:14.420]   next door, at least you get a step-up in basis, and you restart with a $468,000 tax basis,
[00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:18.260]   and you've taken your tax-free gain from moving from the property.
[00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:21.480]   But those are the three factors, and then you would just have to decide how to weight
[00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:26.600]   them based upon the individual circumstances of this particular house, as compared to alternative
[00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:33.000]   houses, this particular market, as compared to the future, and then the value of that
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:38.080]   tax-free gain now, versus something inherent to the property itself.
[00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:40.480]   I see.
[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:46.000]   And so let me ask, does this impact your advice as well?
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.760]   So I mean, we're not really investors at all.
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:51.440]   We just happen to buy a new home.
[00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:59.140]   Our agent said, "Hey, your mortgage is only $2,800, and you can rent for $2,800."
[00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:02.340]   And we're like, "Oh, okay, well, let's move forward with that."
[00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:09.720]   So we're not heavy investors and real estate enthusiasts in that sense.
[00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:15.240]   Given that information, does that impact any of the advice you've given?
[00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:17.960]   It's good to acquire and keep assets.
[00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:23.960]   The people who tend to be the wealthiest in the long-term are those who just buy assets
[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:26.380]   and hold them forever.
[00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:33.000]   So if you wind up in a situation where you've bought this asset and you own it, your wealth
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.120]   will probably be the greatest in the long-term if you just keep it.
[00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:40.840]   For example, you probably have a very low mortgage interest rate because you bought
[00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:43.280]   this property when interest rates were low.
[00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:46.660]   And so you can just sit here with this property, and the tenant will pay it off for you, and
[00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:48.320]   you'll have that for the rest of your life.
[00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:53.980]   But if you sell it today, and you're not really real estate people, then there's a good chance
[00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:59.400]   that you're going to wind up spending the gain or putting it in something else that
[00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:01.880]   may not be – and you may not save it.
[00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:06.860]   So it's hard for me to answer because it's a personalized thing, as always.
[00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:12.040]   If you're going to take the money from the sale of the property, and you're going to
[00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:18.100]   consume it instead of investing it, then you would be better off just keeping this property
[00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:22.880]   so that the money is not consumed, even though in the future, you'll probably wind up paying
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:26.000]   a little bit more long-term capital gains tax.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:30.480]   And so what you said, "We're not really real estate people," then in general, I would
[00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:33.920]   say you're probably going to be richer in the long run if you don't sell it, you just
[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:40.600]   keep it, let the property management people manage it, and because you're just acquiring
[00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:45.440]   an asset and keeping it and not consuming it, then you'll probably be wealthier in
[00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:47.280]   the long run because of it.
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:51.560]   But that's the framework, is are you going to consume it or not?
[00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:54.440]   If you – this is a convenient way to do it.
[00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:58.720]   There's a lot of people out there who don't mind owning a few properties, who wouldn't
[00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:02.880]   go out and buy a rental property, but they don't mind accumulating a few.
[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:08.960]   And since it's so easy, you occupied the property with traditional financing, you've
[00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:13.760]   already got a mortgage locked in, you don't need to do anything, then based upon what
[00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:18.400]   you said, my bias would be to say, "Just keep it, let the tenant pay off the mortgage
[00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:23.400]   for you, and in the future, when that's done, you'll have a very valuable asset,
[00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:26.880]   it'll continue to increase in value, as long as you don't get too much trouble from
[00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:31.240]   the tenants, it's reasonable, the property management company is doing a good job, you'll
[00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:35.840]   probably be happier to just keep it and let the asset continue to accumulate rather than
[00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:40.240]   selling it and having to face the risk of, "What do I spend the money on?
[00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:41.240]   Do I consume it?
[00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:43.160]   And also, what do I invest it in?"
[00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:44.960]   And you probably don't want to go out and find another house.
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:49.600]   So this is one of those behavioral finance things where there's a technical answer,
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:53.080]   which is kind of what I gave you, but there's also just the behavioral answer, which is
[00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:55.960]   to say, "It's always better to acquire assets and keep them for the long term than
[00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:57.720]   it is to be shuffling things around."
[00:40:57.720 --> 00:40:58.720]   Understood.
[00:40:58.720 --> 00:40:59.720]   Understood.
[00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:02.200]   Do I have time for another question?
[00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:03.200]   Sure.
[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:04.200]   Go ahead.
[00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:11.320]   And so with that, in keeping it, I've been looking at LLC or land trust, and is there
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:15.840]   any benefit if we're going to keep it to start looking at those or one of those or something
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:19.760]   else to go for protection, I guess it would be?
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:20.760]   No.
[00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:21.760]   In my opinion, no.
[00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:22.760]   Okay.
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:23.760]   No.
[00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:31.520]   So the answer to an LLC is if you – so there are technical reasons such as ease of transfer
[00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:36.200]   or something like that that you want to transfer the LLC.
[00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:41.080]   People promote LLCs as a significant form of asset protection.
[00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:49.120]   I'm pretty ambivalent about whether it's actually effective or not, or even necessary.
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:54.320]   If you're talking about you own a house and a rental property, I don't think that's
[00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:56.860]   in any way necessary.
[00:41:56.860 --> 00:42:02.400]   And it seems to me that it's more of a benefit to the lawyer who's drawing up the LLC than
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:04.120]   it's likely to be for you.
[00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:09.400]   I mean, I'm just – I love the topics of asset protection and whatnot.
[00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:15.000]   I'm just so deeply skeptical of so much of it that chances are if you do – and you
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.720]   have to – by the way, you have to do things properly.
[00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:21.680]   And if you do things properly, the idea of you going out and setting up an LLC just – what's
[00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:22.680]   the point?
[00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:24.280]   What does doing it properly mean?
[00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:28.560]   Well, make sure the house is in good condition, that it's up to code, that everything's
[00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:29.560]   working in it.
[00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:33.160]   You're not going to have some electrical fire because you did something stupid and
[00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:34.160]   didn't follow the code.
[00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:38.160]   Make sure you've got proper management in place, and then make sure you have proper
[00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:39.320]   insurance in place.
[00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:44.160]   But you just generally don't need to ever do anything beyond good insurance in order
[00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:45.160]   to be protected.
[00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:46.400]   That's why you have insurance.
[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:51.320]   And so when you go and start setting up LLCs and whatnot, it's expensive to set them
[00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:52.320]   up.
[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:54.680]   It's expensive to maintain them, especially for someone like you who's not doing them
[00:42:54.680 --> 00:43:00.440]   and not in the business yourself, doesn't have already the relationships established.
[00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:03.560]   And the protection that they offer, I think, is quite modest.
[00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:06.840]   And if you have one, first thing that's going to happen if you get sued is the LLC
[00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:09.360]   is going to get sued and you're going to get sued.
[00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:14.520]   And then in terms of setting it up in a land trust, I think the biggest benefit of a land
[00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:17.360]   trust is regarding privacy.
[00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:21.000]   But at this point in time, you have no privacy because you already owned it.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   And so what's the point of transferring it from a house to a trust when you were clearly
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:29.680]   on the deed as the previous owner?
[00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:32.800]   So no, I wouldn't bother with any of that stuff from what you're describing to me so
[00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:33.800]   far.
[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:37.360]   Truly appreciate it, Joshua.
[00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:38.360]   Thank you so much.
[00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:39.360]   My pleasure.
[00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:41.760]   We go to Nevada to Blair.
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:42.760]   Blair, welcome to the show.
[00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:43.760]   How can I serve you today?
[00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:44.760]   Hey, Josh.
[00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:45.760]   How are you doing today?
[00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:46.760]   Blair Wilson.
[00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:47.760]   How are you?
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:48.760]   Doing great.
[00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:49.760]   Thanks for taking my call.
[00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:54.640]   I had maybe two quick questions if you have the time for it.
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:58.320]   First one is around the idea of financial minimalism.
[00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:05.520]   I'm getting fatigued with modern society, how I've got multiple bank accounts now, different
[00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:09.560]   retirement vehicles, different custodians, different credit cards.
[00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:14.600]   And I think about the fact that if I were to pass today, I would hate for somebody to
[00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:16.720]   deal with all of this stuff.
[00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:23.200]   And I get nervous, obviously, about having everything consolidated under one roof for
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:24.360]   one vendor.
[00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:28.880]   But any approaches you've taken, I've heard you talk in the past that, you know, when
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:35.280]   I die, I'd love to have a twin bed in my child's house and, you know, go out easy.
[00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:37.880]   But any thoughts on how to approach this logically?
[00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:38.880]   Yeah.
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:48.280]   I can't, in good faith, suggest extreme minimalism on something so important as banking.
[00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:49.280]   I can't.
[00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:56.440]   Like, I have had so many bank accounts flagged just for stupid things and I can't access
[00:44:56.440 --> 00:45:02.680]   my money that the idea of having one bank account makes me just like wake up in shivers.
[00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:07.880]   Now, I don't think that's necessarily for everyone, but I do think that having multiple
[00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:11.640]   banks and multiple bank accounts is really important.
[00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:17.160]   Just for mundane things, you know, again, fraud, fraud alerts, travel alerts, they don't
[00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:22.400]   take this particular brand of card or there's an issue in the computer glitch and, you know,
[00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:26.880]   Bank of America can't process, what was the issue a couple of weeks ago, they can't process
[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:29.600]   deposits, things like that.
[00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:35.040]   I'm probably really sensitive to this due to my internationally oriented lifestyle,
[00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:39.460]   but I still think it's a significant ongoing thing for most people and you got to be careful
[00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:40.460]   of it.
[00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:44.000]   If you had it, just imagine you had all your money in one checking account and you use
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:49.780]   a debit card somewhere and then somebody fraudulently charges your debit card and wipes out your
[00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:55.160]   main account and yes, of course, you'll eventually be able to get that money back because it
[00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:59.840]   was fraudulent and it's protected by the guarantees, but in the meantime, everything else in your
[00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:01.580]   structure falls apart.
[00:46:01.580 --> 00:46:07.360]   So I don't think that the goal should be to just have one bank account for most of us.
[00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:10.160]   And so how many is too many?
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:13.120]   Well, it would depend on circumstances.
[00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:18.480]   It's kind of silly, but my answer to that is the rule of three.
[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:21.680]   So two is one, one is none, three is for me.
[00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:22.680]   That's what I say.
[00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:24.040]   Two is one, one is none, three is for me.
[00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:25.560]   I have a podcast on it.
[00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:28.280]   You can go back and find it.
[00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:33.200]   And then what I want to do is I want to say two is one, one is none, three is for me,
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:35.960]   and I want complementary redundancy.
[00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:42.600]   And so what I try to do in every area is I try to choose three things that are complementary
[00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:45.720]   and that are redundant, but have different features.
[00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:53.080]   So for banking, I would like to have one banking relationship with a large national bank, one
[00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:56.600]   of the big monster mega banks that has ATMs everywhere, etc.
[00:46:56.600 --> 00:47:02.280]   I would like to have one banking relationship with a small local credit union that can be
[00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:04.880]   near my house or can be on the other side of the country.
[00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:08.240]   And then the third one, we can fill it in with a couple of things.
[00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:15.120]   So if I have a banking relationship with a large monster mega bank and I have a small
[00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:19.600]   local credit union, then the third bank that I might fill in might be a small local or
[00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:21.840]   regional bank on the other side of the country.
[00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:22.840]   I would do that.
[00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:26.060]   So I have a little bit of privacy around that particular account if someone's doing an asset
[00:47:26.060 --> 00:47:28.480]   search on me or something like that.
[00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:31.040]   I might choose an account that has more features.
[00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:35.440]   So let's say we would choose an online bank account where I get a higher interest rate
[00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:39.480]   or easy to set up multiple accounts for my bookkeeping, things like that.
[00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:45.160]   I might choose a bank that gives me something like fee-free international ATM card distributions.
[00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:49.840]   So I might choose one of the banks that offers that and refunds all my fees.
[00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:56.900]   So I'm looking just for what's a feature that I don't have in my first two banks so that
[00:47:56.900 --> 00:47:57.900]   they're different.
[00:47:57.900 --> 00:47:59.380]   And I have a reason to have all three of them.
[00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:00.860]   It's not just to have to have three.
[00:48:00.860 --> 00:48:01.860]   I think it's stupid.
[00:48:01.860 --> 00:48:02.860]   No, it's too stupid.
[00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:03.860]   I shouldn't use that word.
[00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:09.420]   I think it's not like what's the point of having an account at Wells Fargo, Bank of
[00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:13.900]   America, and Chase unless they're all the same.
[00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:14.900]   It doesn't matter.
[00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:17.100]   Pick one and then supplement with something else.
[00:48:17.100 --> 00:48:19.140]   Again, supplement with the credit union.
[00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:23.220]   Supplement with the Charles Schwab checking account that gives you international fee-free
[00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:25.340]   transfers, things like that.
[00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:27.740]   And then so to me, that makes sense.
[00:48:27.740 --> 00:48:29.860]   You judge it for yourself, but to me, that makes sense.
[00:48:29.860 --> 00:48:35.500]   Now, you can have a simple lifestyle set up with that, but having three bank accounts
[00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:38.580]   is not a problem create for your executor.
[00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:39.580]   It's three bank accounts.
[00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:40.580]   Three accounts.
[00:48:40.580 --> 00:48:45.700]   Here's a notice of so-and-so's death or I've got to do this thing with his accounts.
[00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:47.900]   Here's my power of attorney, et cetera.
[00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:52.400]   You'll probably have one primary account that you use, and then you'll set up some structure
[00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:58.180]   where your income will flow into this account and it'll be dispersed in a simple way.
[00:48:58.180 --> 00:48:59.540]   Same thing with investment accounts.
[00:48:59.540 --> 00:49:06.660]   So investment accounts, you want them to be as simple as possible, but not so simple that
[00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:09.300]   you miss out on something that's important to you.
[00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:13.060]   Now, just like with banks, we're going to have FDIC insurance, with investment accounts,
[00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:14.780]   we're going to have CIFIC insurance.
[00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:22.740]   So I don't get too worried if somebody has one large investment account and everything's
[00:49:22.740 --> 00:49:26.840]   in one place, especially if it's with a good provider, et cetera.
[00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:29.500]   There is insurance, et cetera.
[00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:36.880]   But to have everything in one place, even though regulators and whatnot do a pretty
[00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:43.180]   good job of watching out for fraud and things like that, just imagine having your life savings
[00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:50.820]   in one institution, and that institution goes belly up, somebody commits fraud, et cetera.
[00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:56.640]   Even if you're legally protected in the long run, to sit back and wait for a court case
[00:49:56.640 --> 00:50:02.980]   and wait for a representative of the court, a trustee, to go through and release your
[00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:08.140]   funds and things like that from one institution, to me, that's just an unacceptable risk.
[00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:11.500]   And so we want to have at least two or three accounts.
[00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:17.900]   And so probably something like an 80/20 approach is right, that we'll have 80% of our money
[00:50:17.900 --> 00:50:20.460]   with our primary account.
[00:50:20.460 --> 00:50:25.780]   Our primary, it might be your 401(k) or it might be someplace you keep an IRA, but let's
[00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:28.100]   go ahead and just keep 20% in somewhere else.
[00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:33.220]   And so look for two is one, one is none, three is for me, and look for complementary redundancy.
[00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:40.420]   And so look for a platform if you're custodianing, if you're seeking a new custodian for investment
[00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:46.260]   accounts, look for a platform that offers you better trading services or lower fees
[00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:50.180]   or better transfers or a nice checking account attached, et cetera.
[00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:54.780]   And look for just some way to set it up that makes sense to you.
[00:50:54.780 --> 00:50:55.780]   That would be my thought.
[00:50:55.780 --> 00:51:00.500]   Where I think simplicity is really excellent, though, and where it really matters is not
[00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:04.880]   the number of accounts, but rather the daily structure.
[00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:10.020]   And so I'm an advocate for some people of things like tracking their money, budgeting,
[00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:11.020]   et cetera.
[00:51:11.020 --> 00:51:14.880]   But I often actually tell people to stop worrying so much about it.
[00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:21.200]   And so it's not uncommon for me in private consultations to talk with someone and to
[00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:23.460]   say, listen, let's set up some simple rules.
[00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:31.260]   Simple rule number one is you set up an automatic contribution into your employer-sponsored
[00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:35.100]   retirement plans, and you max them out every single year, no matter what.
[00:51:35.100 --> 00:51:43.700]   So the beauty of that is simply that if you do that, you're going to be rich, done.
[00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:52.340]   Simple rule number two is that you put 80% of your remaining check into a checking account,
[00:51:52.340 --> 00:51:55.280]   20% goes to a savings account at a different bank.
[00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:58.580]   Simple rule number three is you never borrow money.
[00:51:58.580 --> 00:52:02.300]   And if you do that, you probably don't have that many expenses.
[00:52:02.300 --> 00:52:08.020]   And so someone who's in a situation like that I don't think needs to engage in complicated
[00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:09.740]   financial tracking, et cetera.
[00:52:09.740 --> 00:52:12.420]   Just pull up in your checking account and see if you have money.
[00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:13.620]   And if you have money, spend it.
[00:52:13.620 --> 00:52:16.140]   If you don't have money, then don't spend it.
[00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:18.980]   And if you mess something up and there's a bill or something that's going to bounce,
[00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:22.460]   then have that savings account there where it just automatically pulls from that and
[00:52:22.460 --> 00:52:25.980]   then recognize, hey, I need to stop spending money because I just had to have an overdraft
[00:52:25.980 --> 00:52:31.060]   protection from the savings account to pay my electricity bill or something like that.
[00:52:31.060 --> 00:52:35.900]   I think that works fine if you set it up in advance and if you know I'm investing, I don't
[00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:38.020]   borrow money, and have some simple rules.
[00:52:38.020 --> 00:52:40.580]   And to me, that's what a lot of us really want with regard to simplicity.
[00:52:40.580 --> 00:52:44.620]   It's not that it's burdensome to have too many accounts.
[00:52:44.620 --> 00:52:50.580]   It's rather that it's burdensome to spend hours a week trying to track every $0.37 transaction.
[00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:56.560]   And so let's set up some kind of simple financial system that allows you to systematically just
[00:52:56.560 --> 00:53:00.020]   spend money on the things that you want to spend money and know that you're totally fine
[00:53:00.020 --> 00:53:03.180]   to do that because you've taken care of the important things first.
[00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:05.220]   No, that's great.
[00:53:05.220 --> 00:53:09.380]   I appreciate the philosophy on that and really great insight.
[00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:10.380]   I appreciate that.
[00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:11.380]   Good.
[00:53:11.380 --> 00:53:12.380]   You had a second question?
[00:53:12.380 --> 00:53:13.380]   Yeah, just real quick.
[00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:19.700]   I know you've hit on this in the past and I couldn't find when, but I consume way too
[00:53:19.700 --> 00:53:20.700]   much content.
[00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:25.540]   And I remember you saying, making a comment about if you're pressed for time or if you're
[00:53:25.540 --> 00:53:31.060]   prioritizing things, it's better to, your approach would be to listen to books versus
[00:53:31.060 --> 00:53:32.060]   listen to podcasts.
[00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:36.820]   And I wondered if you could just unpack that again real quick.
[00:53:36.820 --> 00:53:38.180]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:53:38.180 --> 00:53:47.460]   When I create a podcast, I generally am talking mostly extemporaneously off of something that
[00:53:47.460 --> 00:53:50.020]   has been on my mind for a while.
[00:53:50.020 --> 00:53:54.780]   It's not fair to say that I sit down and just hit record.
[00:53:54.780 --> 00:53:55.860]   That's not true at all.
[00:53:55.860 --> 00:54:01.460]   I spend hours and hours and hours and hours thinking about a podcast topic when I do a
[00:54:01.460 --> 00:54:11.420]   podcast, but generally speaking, my preparation to record a podcast is somewhere between zero
[00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:17.860]   to 20 minutes of kind of jotting some notes down, something like that.
[00:54:17.860 --> 00:54:19.580]   I'm a skilled speaker.
[00:54:19.580 --> 00:54:21.660]   Most of the time I can stay on track.
[00:54:21.660 --> 00:54:25.980]   Most of the time I can deliver what I want to deliver.
[00:54:25.980 --> 00:54:30.780]   A lot of times, I'll hit record, I'll get five minutes in and I'll say, "Nah, I'm going
[00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:31.780]   to stop.
[00:54:31.780 --> 00:54:34.580]   I'm going to pivot and start again," and do something like that.
[00:54:34.580 --> 00:54:40.380]   But at the end of the day, I think most podcasters, let's say you listen to an hour podcast, the
[00:54:40.380 --> 00:54:46.980]   podcaster is drawing on his life experience, his just thinking about subjects generally
[00:54:46.980 --> 00:54:52.900]   speaking, and about an hour of preparation for an hour of content.
[00:54:52.900 --> 00:55:02.700]   That's a pretty low ratio of pithiness for a podcast.
[00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:07.780]   I might be underselling it because the pithiness comes from all the other stuff.
[00:55:07.780 --> 00:55:15.500]   For example, I just gave you a speech extemporaneously with zero preparation, but that speech about
[00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:20.380]   your question about financial minimalism, I've been thinking about that for years and
[00:55:20.380 --> 00:55:22.980]   years and years.
[00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:25.840]   It's unfair to say that there was no preparation for it.
[00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:30.660]   There was a lot of preparation for it, but in terms of my delivery of it, I didn't have
[00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:32.540]   the examples planned out.
[00:55:32.540 --> 00:55:37.940]   That's just all extemporaneous speaking of me trying to identify good or useful examples.
[00:55:37.940 --> 00:55:44.260]   The pithiness of a podcast is much lower than a book or a magazine article or a journal
[00:55:44.260 --> 00:55:46.300]   article in terms of preparation.
[00:55:46.300 --> 00:55:54.100]   When someone writes a book, then generally speaking, there are hundreds and hundreds
[00:55:54.100 --> 00:55:58.180]   and hundreds of hours spent writing the content.
[00:55:58.180 --> 00:56:06.440]   The process of writing naturally distills your thoughts to the essence of the content.
[00:56:06.440 --> 00:56:11.220]   You edit yourself when you're writing to make sure that you're being as clear as possible.
[00:56:11.220 --> 00:56:17.480]   Then normally, prior to writing, minimum, you're spending hundreds of hours of focus
[00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:23.340]   targeted research, and in many cases, thousands of hours of focus targeted research.
[00:56:23.340 --> 00:56:28.740]   That research is generally of a much more scholarly nature than a quick web search for
[00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:32.540]   an article to spark a podcaster's thinking.
[00:56:32.540 --> 00:56:37.260]   You're spending time understanding the books that have been written on this topic that
[00:56:37.260 --> 00:56:44.000]   you're writing a book on, and then those authors before you have done that process as well.
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:49.940]   The research that you do preparing for a book represents thousands and thousands and thousands
[00:56:49.940 --> 00:56:56.040]   of man hours for, in many cases, at least decades, and most of the time, centuries or
[00:56:56.040 --> 00:56:58.600]   perhaps even millennia.
[00:56:58.600 --> 00:57:07.020]   In many cases, many books, many subjects, we're reaching back 2,000, 3,000, 4,000 years,
[00:57:07.020 --> 00:57:13.380]   and we're tracing that thinking process up to today in order to talk about what we're
[00:57:13.380 --> 00:57:14.380]   doing.
[00:57:14.380 --> 00:57:17.280]   That doesn't happen in podcasts generally.
[00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:24.860]   In terms of sheer bang for the buck of pithiness and insights and carefully considered thoughts
[00:57:24.860 --> 00:57:31.660]   and careful research, an audio book blows every podcast in the world out of the water.
[00:57:31.660 --> 00:57:33.500]   So what's the point of a podcast?
[00:57:33.500 --> 00:57:45.540]   Well, a podcast really shines with bringing thinking current and giving specific application.
[00:57:45.540 --> 00:57:49.520]   That's where podcasts are fantastic.
[00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:55.060]   When you write a book, because the creation and editing process is so involved that it's
[00:57:55.060 --> 00:57:58.480]   always necessarily out of date.
[00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:02.300]   Even if the author is doing everything he can to get it done, a professionally published
[00:58:02.300 --> 00:58:08.220]   and recorded book is six months, 12 months out of date at the fastest it could possibly
[00:58:08.220 --> 00:58:09.500]   be done.
[00:58:09.500 --> 00:58:15.640]   And so when you have a podcast episode with an author, for example, what you give up in
[00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:21.700]   terms of clarity or pithiness of content, you gain back in terms of current cutting
[00:58:21.700 --> 00:58:24.940]   edge insight into a current situation.
[00:58:24.940 --> 00:58:28.060]   You also gain it in terms of topic application.
[00:58:28.060 --> 00:58:32.500]   And so the ability to take something that doesn't fit the carefully edited nature of
[00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:37.620]   a book and talk about it on an ad hoc basis, that's where a podcast really shines.
[00:58:37.620 --> 00:58:44.420]   Because due to the intense editing process of the book, that in and of itself makes it
[00:58:44.420 --> 00:58:51.980]   so pithy, it automatically culls out the number of topics that an author will write about
[00:58:51.980 --> 00:58:58.700]   to just what fits the thesis of the book and just what he can support in terms of evidence
[00:58:58.700 --> 00:59:01.780]   and research and good arguments, etc.
[00:59:01.780 --> 00:59:02.900]   But a podcast is not that way.
[00:59:02.900 --> 00:59:06.840]   If a guy pulls out a microphone or pulls out his phone and just shoots something, he may
[00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:11.100]   just have seven minutes of content, but it's seven minutes of interesting content.
[00:59:11.100 --> 00:59:17.540]   And because he feels good about the ephemeral nature of the podcast or the YouTube or whatever
[00:59:17.540 --> 00:59:22.100]   the current thing is, it's ephemeral content.
[00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:28.620]   And so he doesn't have to go and prove this out with 15 cited resources.
[00:59:28.620 --> 00:59:32.180]   And if all he has to say is seven minutes, that's all he has to say.
[00:59:32.180 --> 00:59:36.380]   So as I see it, there's a great balance here that should be achieved.
[00:59:36.380 --> 00:59:41.380]   And it's not that you should only choose one or the other, but that you should be thoughtful
[00:59:41.380 --> 00:59:47.020]   about why you're consuming the content and then making sure that you're consuming content
[00:59:47.020 --> 00:59:48.620]   that's feeding you.
[00:59:48.620 --> 00:59:55.440]   I don't think 80% of our listening should be YouTube or podcasts.
[00:59:55.440 --> 01:00:01.700]   I think maybe it's not 80% books, but I think at least 50% should be books.
[01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:12.260]   Because the medium creates the message and the kind of person who consumes books is going
[01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:18.100]   to be forced, like it or not, to be a deeper, more thoughtful person.
[01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:22.820]   Someone who thinks more critically, who thinks on a deeper level, and who has a wider degree
[01:00:22.820 --> 01:00:26.660]   of exposure than someone who listens to podcasts or YouTube.
[01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:33.340]   But if the person only consumes books, they may be missing out on the group conversation
[01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:37.260]   and also on the current application of it.
[01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:42.100]   I guess that would be the other thing I should have pointed out with regards to a podcast.
[01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:43.340]   Writing is hard.
[01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:44.500]   Writing is really hard.
[01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:46.900]   And good writing is really hard.
[01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:49.100]   Publishing is really hard.
[01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:50.980]   Shooting a YouTube video, not so hard.
[01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:58.060]   And so I think there are a lot of people who would never be writers who can create other
[01:00:58.060 --> 01:01:00.140]   forms of content.
[01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:08.020]   And because they're creating something useful in that format, but because they're good thinkers,
[01:01:08.020 --> 01:01:11.220]   then we should go and pursue them for their thinking ability and other kinds of people
[01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:12.600]   who don't write the books.
[01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:18.440]   So I think a balance is warranted, but it shouldn't just be all podcasts.
[01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:27.940]   And if we really want to master a domain, there is no better path, no faster path, and
[01:01:27.940 --> 01:01:37.060]   truly no other possible path than mastering the books that form the core canon of that
[01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:38.140]   domain.
[01:01:38.140 --> 01:01:42.580]   And then once those books are mastered, we can put on the beautiful frosting of current
[01:01:42.580 --> 01:01:45.040]   exposure with all of the other stuff.
[01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:51.220]   But without the books, it's very hard to be a deep and skilled thinker in a topic just
[01:01:51.220 --> 01:01:53.620]   from listening to YouTube or podcasts.
[01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:54.620]   Awesome.
[01:01:54.620 --> 01:02:00.520]   That's exactly what I wanted you to articulate, so thank you for adding that value.
[01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:02.940]   And Merry Christmas to you and your family, Josh.
[01:02:02.940 --> 01:02:03.940]   Appreciate all you do.
[01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:05.280]   And to you and yours.
[01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:07.620]   We go to the great state of Kansas.
[01:02:07.620 --> 01:02:08.620]   Welcome to the show.
[01:02:08.620 --> 01:02:09.620]   How can I serve you today?
[01:02:09.620 --> 01:02:13.440]   How to crush your performance review with Postmates.

[01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:24.540]   What's that?
[01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:25.540]   Imposter syndrome?
[01:02:25.540 --> 01:02:29.620]   Man, you'll punch it in the face, because those gifts you added to the presentation
[01:02:29.620 --> 01:02:33.100]   do make an impact that your boss does recognize.
[01:02:33.100 --> 01:02:34.100]   Get coffee on Postmates.

[01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:40.920]   Hey, Joshua.
[01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:43.440]   Thank you for taking the call.
[01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:47.640]   Got a question about paper.
[01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:52.280]   I know you've been traveling a lot and have been for a while, and you're out of the U.S.
[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:53.280]   and all that good stuff.
[01:02:53.280 --> 01:03:00.680]   I was wondering what your approach is to paper documents, important documents.
[01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:03.240]   Do you just make everything digital?
[01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:04.240]   Do you have a system?
[01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:05.960]   Have you ever given any thought to that?
[01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:10.880]   I'm trying to reduce a lot of clutter and stuff in the house and just want to know what
[01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:11.880]   your thoughts are on that.
[01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:12.880]   Yes.
[01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:20.120]   I've given it a lot of thought, and I have done a lot of different things.
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:23.680]   Be more specific with the clutter or the paper that is annoying you.
[01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:27.160]   What do you want to reduce and get rid of?
[01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:33.800]   Well, we try to go paperless with a lot of the bills and just normal stuff that comes
[01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:34.800]   in the mail.
[01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:44.000]   So we've reduced a lot of that, but I don't really know what to do with some things like
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:52.720]   auto records or even some artwork from the kid's school.
[01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:57.280]   The random things that you just think, "I might need this someday."
[01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:01.800]   I don't know if I just inherited this from my parents or something, but I don't really
[01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:07.640]   have a good way to think about what to keep and how to keep it, and if digitizing it is
[01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:12.640]   really any better than storing it in a file cabinet.
[01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:13.640]   Right.
[01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:20.820]   It's a complex subject that could go different ways, but I'll give you some of my experiences
[01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:23.080]   and hopefully those will inform you.
[01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:33.560]   First, I don't think that stuff, including paper, is generally bothersome in and of itself.
[01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:38.520]   It's disorganized stuff that is generally bothersome.
[01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:46.840]   So I would ask, can you begin by simply organizing your things a little bit better and set up
[01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:50.120]   an organizational system that will work for you?
[01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:57.700]   I don't think pursuing a 100% paperless system is smart or advisable, even though in many
[01:04:57.700 --> 01:05:00.400]   cases it's technically possible.
[01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:06.140]   And so we all need some kind of organization system that works.
[01:05:06.140 --> 01:05:15.040]   For paper, the key is some kind of file drawer or file box or file cabinet or file bag, a
[01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:17.940]   set of manila folders, and a labeler.
[01:05:17.940 --> 01:05:20.280]   Do you own a labeler?
[01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:23.080]   Yes, we do, actually.
[01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:24.080]   Perfect.
[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:25.080]   Labeler is life-changing.
[01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:31.200]   And so you should give yourself full freedom to label things quickly and freely and just
[01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:32.760]   do it.
[01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:37.240]   And having your paper organized is going to be the first step.
[01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:41.000]   So even if you were to digitize it, you first need to organize it.
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:46.680]   So the organization system is file folders and a file cabinet or file box, etc.
[01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:51.880]   And it's pretty easy to do that and worth doing.
[01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:53.560]   It's necessary to do that if you're going to digitize.
[01:05:53.560 --> 01:06:00.700]   The only reason you wouldn't want to just keep that system would be if there were some
[01:06:00.700 --> 01:06:03.640]   compelling reason why you needed to digitize.
[01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:07.560]   So when I was going traveling full time, I digitized everything.
[01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:09.920]   I digitized a 2,000 book library.
[01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:11.920]   I did destructive scanning.
[01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:13.920]   I chopped off the spines of all my books.
[01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:19.200]   I bought a fancy duplex scanner, and I scanned all my books, and I got rid of everything,
[01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:20.200]   every book.
[01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:21.600]   I digitized all my papers.
[01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:23.320]   I digitized all my old journals.
[01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:27.240]   I chopped up my yearbooks and digitized those, and I got rid of everything.
[01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:32.840]   I regret some of that stuff, specifically because digital files have their own issues.
[01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:34.680]   So I backed some of my journals, right?
[01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:36.400]   I had 10 years of personal journals.
[01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:37.820]   I digitized them all.
[01:06:37.820 --> 01:06:40.200]   I was worried a little bit about it from a privacy perspective.
[01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:42.040]   I was like, "I'll just go ahead and digitize these things."
[01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:44.640]   So I digitized them, and I shredded them.
[01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:51.800]   Well then I put them on a computer system, and because they were important to me, I encrypted
[01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:52.800]   them.
[01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:53.800]   I password protected them.
[01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:57.760]   I backed them up on an encrypted disk, and that encrypted disk, I can't get into it because
[01:06:57.760 --> 01:06:59.520]   I forgot my password.
[01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:02.280]   Now that's a stupid, stupid thing to do.
[01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:06.600]   Eventually I'll find a copy of them, and I probably have them a few backups, but it's
[01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:07.600]   an example.
[01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:09.200]   In theory, I should be smart, right?
[01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:11.240]   In theory, I should know what I'm doing.
[01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:13.920]   At the time, I used this password every day.
[01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:20.080]   I had it all squared away, and I said, "There's no chance of my forgetting this."
[01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:23.240]   But then I went on, did something else, and I came back some months later, and I couldn't
[01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:25.080]   reproduce the password.
[01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:30.840]   So that was frustrating, but again, it's not the end of the world, but it's frustrating.
[01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:32.120]   So here I am.
[01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:36.400]   I should know what I'm doing, and I make a stupid mistake like that.
[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:37.400]   I've worked with clients.
[01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:44.400]   I have a client that lost a few million dollars' worth of Bitcoin on a drive that was backed
[01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:46.320]   up with a password and can't come up with a password.
[01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:48.360]   He's tried to crack it, et cetera.
[01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:49.520]   It's gone.
[01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:55.600]   So digital things have their own danger, and it's not the perfect solution.
[01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:56.880]   So start with organization.
[01:07:56.880 --> 01:07:58.680]   That's step one.
[01:07:58.680 --> 01:08:04.520]   Things that have a low cost can just be gotten rid of right there.
[01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:09.600]   So if you have bills, paper bills or something that comes in, most of that stuff doesn't
[01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:12.240]   need any kind of filing or organization.
[01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:16.560]   It needs to be shredded, and most of that stuff should be digitized.
[01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:22.200]   So I think the simplest way to do that, to digitize those kinds of things, is to set
[01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:26.600]   up obviously an account, and if you're going to have email, then I would just set up a
[01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:29.320]   separate email account that is exclusively for this.
[01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:33.520]   It should probably be an account like ProtonMail or other encrypted email service.
[01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:36.320]   Just have everything go there, and you only log into it when you need to go and check
[01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:37.880]   a statement or something.
[01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:41.320]   So there's no point in having paper coming in for that stuff.
[01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:46.160]   Paper is a significant identity theft risk problem.
[01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:50.080]   It is much better for you to have monthly statements and things like that delivered
[01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:55.800]   digitally due to the identity theft risks of having those documents sitting in your
[01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:56.800]   mailbox.
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:58.360]   So I think that makes a lot of sense.
[01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:05.360]   When it comes to records, educational records, things like that, it's not that burdensome
[01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:10.400]   to have a file folder for each child.
[01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:16.660]   I think they should be digitized in case they're lost, but they should also be kept as hard
[01:09:16.660 --> 01:09:20.880]   copy in case the digital file gets corrupted.
[01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:27.440]   There's not any reason why you shouldn't have a couple of boxes of important papers in your
[01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:31.320]   life, even if they're stored off-site or something like that.
[01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:32.320]   We can do that.
[01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:37.080]   And there are good reasons to need and want those things that you may not perceive now.
[01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:40.360]   I'll give two examples from my own life.
[01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:44.880]   This is unique to me with my internationalization and stuff, but first of all, I have children
[01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:48.280]   who have been born outside of the United States.
[01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:54.720]   And if those children ever want to pass along citizenship, U.S. citizenship to their children,
[01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:59.440]   and if they were married to – I won't go into all the details – but they need
[01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:06.400]   to demonstrate that they have lived in the United States prior to a certain age.
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:11.200]   And so if they don't have physical copies of that to be able to demonstrate at a certain
[01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:16.300]   time, then something extremely valuable like a citizenship could be lost.
[01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:19.320]   This happened a number of years ago when I was interacting with something for one of
[01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:25.800]   my wife's things, and we needed to come up with documentation of her maiden name.
[01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:30.720]   And if we didn't have copies of her passports, copies of her old driver's license and things
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:36.360]   like that of her maiden name, then it would have been troublesome.
[01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:40.160]   Things like old driver's licenses that have your address on them, a lot of times you need
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:43.400]   to verify for a credit check system now.
[01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:46.760]   Who did you reside at 123 Maple Street?
[01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:52.120]   And you get four addresses deep, and it's hard to remember what was my address at that
[01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:53.120]   point in time.
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:55.840]   But you've got to fill out 10 years of address history or something like that.
[01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:59.320]   And so having hard copy records of that stuff is really important.
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:06.040]   Things like Social Security cards, identity documents, obviously last wills and testaments,
[01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:08.240]   statements of deeds, etc.
[01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:11.920]   That stuff all needs to be kept, and it needs to be kept for the long term.
[01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:16.160]   It should be digitized as a backup in case your house burns down, but it shouldn't be
[01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:17.160]   gotten rid of.
[01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:18.440]   It should be maintained.
[01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:25.140]   So I would say organization solves a lot of the frustration that people have with stuff.
[01:11:25.140 --> 01:11:29.040]   And organization will help you to diminish stuff in general.
[01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:34.240]   And I think the best solution for most organizing stuff is a system of files and boxes.
[01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:37.300]   And so for paper, files and boxes is good.
[01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:43.280]   For other stuff too, I myself, I use Ziploc bags, gallon bags, or I use a lot of clear
[01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:46.520]   transparent bags.
[01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:50.520]   Like for example, if you buy a set of sheets or pillowcases, things like that, it comes
[01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:53.520]   in these little just clears, I save all those things.
[01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:56.260]   And I use them to organize things that are like.
[01:11:56.260 --> 01:11:58.860]   And so I label everything.
[01:11:58.860 --> 01:12:04.000]   And if you just have a bag or a folder and it's labeled, and you put something in it,
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:08.720]   even if it's one simple thing, then you now know this thing belongs and I have it.
[01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:09.720]   I'll give you an example.
[01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:12.340]   I have a trampoline for my children.
[01:12:12.340 --> 01:12:17.440]   And if you've ever set up one of these trampolines, you know that you need a trampoline spring
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:20.280]   tool in order to put those springs on and off.
[01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:23.240]   And if you don't have this tool, it's a nightmare to put these springs on and off.
[01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:24.900]   But if you have the tool, it's easy.
[01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:28.320]   So when I bought the trampoline, I had this trampoline spring tool.
[01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:29.320]   I don't want to lose this.
[01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:34.240]   I take the trampoline spring tool, I put it into a gallon size Ziploc bag.
[01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:35.240]   It's clear.
[01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:36.240]   I know what's in it.
[01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:37.240]   I fold it closed.
[01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:41.760]   I take my label maker and I put on it trampoline spring tool and I put a label on the bag and
[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:48.160]   I put it in my stack of my shelves or in some cases I've used bins, boxes, et cetera, and
[01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:49.520]   I just toss it in there.
[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:53.740]   And so sometimes when I'm looking for something, I go in and I just pull everything out.
[01:12:53.740 --> 01:12:57.240]   Because everything's bagged, it's all filed in a sense, it's labeled, et cetera, then
[01:12:57.240 --> 01:13:03.160]   I know like these are things that I've intentionally kept and it's a lot more like I don't have
[01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:08.240]   any angst about it like I would if it were just sitting on a random shelf in a workshop
[01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:09.760]   or something like that.
[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:11.320]   And so same thing with paper.
[01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:17.120]   You do need the paper and it would be only certain people who would ever want to get
[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:18.480]   rid of that stuff.
[01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:20.760]   And one final comment.
[01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:24.220]   I think I have most of the paperless solutions.
[01:13:24.220 --> 01:13:26.120]   I have several scanners.
[01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:27.480]   I have a duplex scanner.
[01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:29.820]   I also have an overhead book scanner now.
[01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:32.080]   It doesn't work well, but I have it.
[01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:34.200]   I have all the devices.
[01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:37.960]   I have all the files swapping around.
[01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:42.200]   I have it pretty well synchronized, et cetera.
[01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:47.680]   I think we overestimate the value and the pleasure of using those things.
[01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:50.560]   And so simple things like books.
[01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:52.920]   I regret digitizing my entire library.
[01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:55.040]   I did a podcast episode on it.
[01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:57.080]   I regret digitizing my entire library.
[01:13:57.080 --> 01:14:01.680]   I wish I had taken about a third of those books and just put them in storage because
[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:05.680]   I've had to go back and buy some of them again because I want the hard copy.
[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:11.000]   With my children and their education, I buy all of their books even though a lot of times
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:14.720]   they're totally free on Kindle and I can just put them on their e-reader on their Kindle
[01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:15.720]   device.
[01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:19.240]   But our brains work better with placement.
[01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:24.960]   And for things that are actually important, especially learning things, the sense of location,
[01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:28.360]   our brains are designed to locate objects.
[01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:34.760]   And so having a location on a page or a location in a book, a physical tangible book, is a
[01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:45.680]   really important and powerful learning tool when compared to having everything digital.
[01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:50.120]   You cannot remember things as effectively when they're presented to you digitally as
[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:51.800]   when they are physical.
[01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:55.080]   And then even the best systems have trouble.
[01:14:55.080 --> 01:15:00.480]   I have been trying for three years to find a book in my library, in my electronic library.
[01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:06.280]   Years ago I bought this book and it was full of – it had these just wonderful financial
[01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:08.400]   stories and parables.
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:13.960]   It was – I read it aloud to my wife at the breakfast table and it was fantastic.
[01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:15.560]   I loved the book.
[01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:18.040]   I digitized it along with all of my other books.
[01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:19.200]   I know it's in my library.
[01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:21.920]   I have a Caliber library, it has 5,000 books on it.
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:23.480]   I know it's there.
[01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:28.660]   But search as I might, I cannot remember the author, I can't remember the name, I cannot
[01:15:28.660 --> 01:15:30.480]   find this book in my library.
[01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:35.280]   At some point I have to go through and just sit there and go through every single one
[01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:37.680]   of my 5,000 books and find them.
[01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:40.200]   But it's very frustrating to me because there have been many times where I've wanted to
[01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:44.920]   create a podcast episode and I can't find it.
[01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:48.200]   And I want to go to that book and read one of the stories and use it as inspiration to
[01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:51.960]   create a podcast episode but I don't have it and I can't lay my hands on it.
[01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:57.480]   And so there's real value in having physical objects, physical books, et cetera.
[01:15:57.480 --> 01:15:59.800]   There's also real value in having digital stuff.
[01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:03.400]   A lot of times when I'm creating a podcast, the fact that I can go to my computer and
[01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:07.560]   I can pull up any paper, any book, et cetera, and I remember where most of the stuff is,
[01:16:07.560 --> 01:16:09.280]   is in and of itself very valuable.
[01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:16.240]   So I'm going to stop there and I'm just going to say that going digital is useful
[01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:18.760]   but don't go too digital.
[01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:24.320]   If you go digital, keep the important hard copy stuff and create a filing system that
[01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:30.200]   makes that work because there's a decent chance that 50 years from now some of that stuff
[01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:31.520]   will be needed.
[01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:38.000]   And physical objects are much more permanent for your child to demonstrate his American
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:43.120]   ancestry or something like that when he's off living in France so that his kid can get
[01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:45.440]   U.S. citizenship.
[01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:50.320]   That stuff, those important physical things are much more important than, "Oh, we've
[01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:53.960]   got all that sitting on this device over here."
[01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:59.160]   There are also very compelling benefits to having digital stuff but you need to be super
[01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:05.800]   careful and don't go there too quickly because I think my story of forgetting my password
[01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:10.280]   for all the scans of all of my journals and things like that, my story is more common
[01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:13.160]   than uncommon.
[01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:18.120]   And we have to learn how to do a better job with our digital management especially when
[01:17:18.120 --> 01:17:19.200]   everything's upgrading.
[01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:21.720]   So is that helpful at all?
[01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:22.720]   Yes.
[01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:23.720]   Yes.
[01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:30.560]   I actually have had a similar, well actually I had a drive fail before I got a chance to
[01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:36.800]   back it up and so I've lost a few digital things in my day as well.
[01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:44.440]   But your framework about organization, I guess step one is to just kind of put things in
[01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:48.000]   perspective because I think that'll help out a lot.
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:54.080]   One quick question, like a follow-up question if I may, on some of the important things.
[01:17:54.080 --> 01:18:01.120]   Do you have any recommendation, especially if you're traveling, what documents or what
[01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:05.680]   you would carry them in or take them in just to kind of keep those things secure like Social
[01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:08.840]   Security cards or birth certificates and stuff like that?
[01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:14.360]   In general I try not to travel with things like that.
[01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:19.440]   So something like Social Security cards specifically, there's zero reason why you would ever need
[01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:21.580]   a Social Security card abroad.
[01:18:21.580 --> 01:18:25.600]   Now birth certificates on the other hand, I do often travel with them, especially if
[01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:29.080]   I'm going somewhere to do an immigration program or something like that, I do often travel
[01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:30.080]   with those.
[01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:38.800]   I use, specifically I use a bag that's made by Eagle Creek, is the manufacturer.
[01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:41.360]   Eagle Creek makes a lot of bags and travel products.
[01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:48.360]   They have a, is it Eagle Creek Packet, I'll give you the specific.
[01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:56.820]   I think it's called Eagle Creek Packet Folder and they have three sizes and the nice thing
[01:18:56.820 --> 01:19:10.800]   about them is, I used to know this brand name off the top of my head, the nice thing about
[01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:19.760]   them is they are, I'll come up with it in a moment, it's Eagle Creek bag and they have
[01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:21.760]   three different sets.
[01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:26.180]   It's from their Packet Cube line, but they're not packing cubes, they are, here we go, Eagle
[01:19:26.180 --> 01:19:33.120]   Creek Packet, okay, so evidently it was the brand name, Eagle Creek Packet Organizer Bags.
[01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:38.280]   So Eagle Creek Packet, P-A-C-K-I-T Organizer Bags.
[01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:45.380]   They have small, medium, large and what's nice about them is they are made of a mesh
[01:19:45.380 --> 01:19:54.300]   material and then inside of the mesh they have a plastic, like a P-U-L liner, a plastic
[01:19:54.300 --> 01:19:55.300]   liner inside.
[01:19:55.300 --> 01:20:00.340]   Now that liner does eventually break down, but that protects it from water damage and
[01:20:00.340 --> 01:20:02.980]   the large size is perfect for documents.
[01:20:02.980 --> 01:20:06.580]   You can fit into it all your documents, slide it in your bag, it's perfect for documents
[01:20:06.580 --> 01:20:15.900]   and so I use it for documents and they come in red, blue and black and I have all the
[01:20:15.900 --> 01:20:18.500]   different colors and I use those usually.
[01:20:18.500 --> 01:20:21.980]   I also just use a gallon size Ziploc bag.
[01:20:21.980 --> 01:20:25.700]   If you use a gallon size Ziploc bag, you can fit into that an eight and a half by eleven
[01:20:25.700 --> 01:20:29.660]   sheet of paper, you have to just kind of put it down just a tiny bit to zip the bag and
[01:20:29.660 --> 01:20:31.620]   then it'll stretch itself out.
[01:20:31.620 --> 01:20:36.940]   So the way that I organize stuff, being mobile actually, I don't have a filing cabinet.
[01:20:36.940 --> 01:20:44.660]   What I do is I have all of my family documents organized in Ziploc bags.
[01:20:44.660 --> 01:20:50.860]   So I have one for me, I have one for my wife and for each of my children and any document
[01:20:50.860 --> 01:20:54.820]   that pertains to the person goes into the Ziploc bag.
[01:20:54.820 --> 01:20:59.300]   Everything's labeled and then I put all of those Ziploc bags inside one of these Eagle
[01:20:59.300 --> 01:21:05.900]   Creek packet bags, the large size and it's bright red and it's in with my safe and so
[01:21:05.900 --> 01:21:09.980]   if I need to leave the house, that's what I'm grabbing.
[01:21:09.980 --> 01:21:13.700]   It's red, it's ready to go and if there's a fire or I have to evacuate or something
[01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:18.660]   like that, that's the bag that I take and it has everything ready to go and it's all
[01:21:18.660 --> 01:21:24.340]   organized, it has my dog's vaccine records, it has all the social security cards for the
[01:21:24.340 --> 01:21:30.180]   children, it has anything that is document related so that if I had to go and leave in
[01:21:30.180 --> 01:21:34.140]   the middle of the night, I have the bag of records and I grab that and go.
[01:21:34.140 --> 01:21:38.420]   And so that's what I do is I use those Eagle Creek bags and Ziploc bags as the primary
[01:21:38.420 --> 01:21:39.940]   organization method.
[01:21:39.940 --> 01:21:47.420]   And I really like that because file cabinets have their place but the scenario that I'm
[01:21:47.420 --> 01:21:52.620]   describing is in some cases more likely than needing it in another case and so I want to
[01:21:52.620 --> 01:21:59.900]   be able to grab a bag and in that bag and I'm a prepper and I'm also like this international
[01:21:59.900 --> 01:22:00.900]   prepper.
[01:22:00.900 --> 01:22:06.620]   So I have basically like seven copies of each of my family's birth certificates, three of
[01:22:06.620 --> 01:22:08.740]   them are apostilled, four of them are not.
[01:22:08.740 --> 01:22:15.860]   I've got notarized copies of my marriage records, I've got everything there ready to go because
[01:22:15.860 --> 01:22:21.620]   of my international experience where I was found wanting and I've got fingerprint cards
[01:22:21.620 --> 01:22:26.140]   done from my wife and me ready to go and then I also keep a whole backup set of that stuff
[01:22:26.140 --> 01:22:27.400]   in another country.
[01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:31.980]   And so if my house did burn down then I would call someone else.
[01:22:31.980 --> 01:22:37.020]   So back to your traveling question, so that's what I use to carry the stuff but in general
[01:22:37.020 --> 01:22:41.820]   you don't want to carry too much of the stuff because paper is simultaneously a benefit
[01:22:41.820 --> 01:22:46.900]   and also a downside and so what I have is I have a password system.
[01:22:46.900 --> 01:22:51.660]   All of my documents, all my credit cards, my driver's licenses, my passports, everything
[01:22:51.660 --> 01:22:58.420]   like that, all of that stuff I have digitized and then backed up in an encrypted system
[01:22:58.420 --> 01:23:06.020]   with a password so that even if everything is stolen from me, like if my phone is stolen,
[01:23:06.020 --> 01:23:12.540]   my bag is stolen, my passport is stolen, etc. all I need is access to a computer, it can
[01:23:12.540 --> 01:23:21.180]   be anyone's computer, it can be anyone's computer, it can be an internet cafe, etc., public computer,
[01:23:21.180 --> 01:23:27.020]   all I need is access to a computer and I can go gain access to my documents and I can print
[01:23:27.020 --> 01:23:28.900]   whatever I need to demonstrate my identity.
[01:23:28.900 --> 01:23:32.740]   So years ago I had my passport stolen, I had to go to the US embassy and I had to get a
[01:23:32.740 --> 01:23:38.220]   new passport and I learned at that moment that if you can't prove your identity it takes
[01:23:38.220 --> 01:23:40.660]   a really long time to get this handled.
[01:23:40.660 --> 01:23:44.500]   If you can demonstrate your identity though, you can get it done pretty quickly and so
[01:23:44.500 --> 01:23:49.520]   this is of course accessible on all my digital devices so if I have my phone and my passport
[01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:54.260]   gets stolen I can just pull out my phone and look here's a copy of the passport so that
[01:23:54.260 --> 01:23:58.920]   the consulate will give me an emergency passport to get me home but then I also have it set
[01:23:58.920 --> 01:24:03.300]   up so that I can access it from any computer regardless of whether it's my phone or not
[01:24:03.300 --> 01:24:06.820]   and that's what I would recommend is that the most important thing with traveling is
[01:24:06.820 --> 01:24:09.360]   to have basically one backup with you.
[01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:14.540]   We used to, all the travel gurus used to recommend having a paper copy, I think that still makes
[01:24:14.540 --> 01:24:17.680]   sense and again depending on the trip.
[01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:23.340]   So when I do an overland trip across borders internationally I do a couple things.
[01:24:23.340 --> 01:24:28.860]   Number one is you always need a stack of copies with you and this is where, forgive the long
[01:24:28.860 --> 01:24:31.020]   answer, hopefully it's at least a little interesting.
[01:24:31.020 --> 01:24:37.740]   If you're going to Europe for two weeks and you're flying from New York to Paris, you
[01:24:37.740 --> 01:24:40.980]   don't need much of this stuff because it's super simple, you just need a passport and
[01:24:40.980 --> 01:24:45.980]   if you have a picture of it on your phone or if you have one paper copy of it that's
[01:24:45.980 --> 01:24:47.340]   all you're going to need.
[01:24:47.340 --> 01:24:51.740]   On the other hand if you're traveling with a vehicle across borders at every single border,
[01:24:51.740 --> 01:24:55.900]   well depending on where you are, not everyone, but a lot of times you need to have multiple
[01:24:55.900 --> 01:25:03.100]   copies of your vehicle ownership documents, your passport, your driver's license, your
[01:25:03.100 --> 01:25:08.420]   insurance information and you've got to have all of them and a lot of times you'll go across
[01:25:08.420 --> 01:25:12.820]   a border and they'll keep one of your documents at both sides and so now you've got eight
[01:25:12.820 --> 01:25:16.380]   pieces of paper that slides away at every document.
[01:25:16.380 --> 01:25:21.020]   And sometimes it can be very hectic depending on the border and so what I do in those cases
[01:25:21.020 --> 01:25:26.900]   is I make color copies of the originals and then I never give them the original unless
[01:25:26.900 --> 01:25:29.820]   they figure out that it's the color copy.
[01:25:29.820 --> 01:25:34.780]   And so that's a useful strategy and in countries where you're required to have your passport
[01:25:34.780 --> 01:25:40.060]   on you, then and it's quite literally the law, but you don't want to take the risk of
[01:25:40.060 --> 01:25:45.940]   carrying the passport, then you go ahead and make a high quality color copy, laminate it
[01:25:45.940 --> 01:25:50.200]   and then basically just plead ignorance about the actual law.
[01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:54.260]   So that way you're probably close enough to being legal without actually having your passport
[01:25:54.260 --> 01:25:56.140]   in your pocket the whole time.
[01:25:56.140 --> 01:25:58.300]   And I've never had any trouble with that.
[01:25:58.300 --> 01:26:02.780]   So you can say, look, here's a copy of my passport and make it a nice color copy that
[01:26:02.780 --> 01:26:07.000]   clearly it's the passport and if we go back to my hotel, back at the hotel safe, there's
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:08.060]   my original version.
[01:26:08.060 --> 01:26:09.660]   So that's how I do it.
[01:26:09.660 --> 01:26:14.700]   I use the Eagle Creek packet organizer bags, the large size is perfect for papers.
[01:26:14.700 --> 01:26:20.560]   I use a Ziploc bags to keep things organized inside of that.
[01:26:20.560 --> 01:26:27.000]   And then based upon the country that you're traveling to, you and the mode of transportation,
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:32.760]   that's where you may need more of those copies and things like that, or you may just it's
[01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:33.760]   not necessary at all.
[01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:34.760]   There's my answer.
[01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:35.760]   Perfect.
[01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:36.760]   Thank you.
[01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:42.200]   You're the perfect guy to answer that question, so that's what I wanted to call it.
[01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:43.200]   Thank you, Joshua.
[01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:44.200]   My pleasure.
[01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:49.400]   You know, you do enough international stuff, all the, like I recommend to people, I teach
[01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:53.660]   this in my international skate plan course, like get your multiple, get your birth certificates,
[01:26:53.660 --> 01:26:54.660]   get your school records.
[01:26:54.660 --> 01:26:58.400]   I have, and I've just learned like all that stuff is important.
[01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:00.400]   So you can add that to your prepping.
[01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:05.720]   I have a sealed version, a sealed copy of college transcripts, high school transcripts,
[01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:09.040]   like everything is done away because I have needed it and not had it.
[01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:12.120]   And so I resolved, I better make sure that I have this next time.
[01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:13.120]   Kyle in Washington.
[01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:14.120]   Welcome to the show.
[01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:15.120]   Have a great day.
[01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:16.120]   Hi there.
[01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:24.000]   Gabriel Custodio's first episode of his podcast is also a good starting point when you're
[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:27.800]   trying to figure out what to throw away and what to keep, although he is a fairly minimal
[01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:33.200]   type of guy, not to discount the last 20 minutes of you talking.
[01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:35.160]   So that's just for the uninitiated.
[01:27:35.160 --> 01:27:38.040]   It's called Watchman Privacy and you can find it.
[01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:40.600]   He has it on YouTube and all the podcast feeds.
[01:27:40.600 --> 01:27:45.120]   So find the Watchman Privacy Podcast, great podcast anyway, and go back and find episode
[01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:46.680]   one and hear his take on that.
[01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:47.680]   Yeah.
[01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:51.360]   In 15 minutes, he'll give you hours and hours of stuff to do.
[01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:54.360]   That's always how it is.
[01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:55.360]   Yeah.
[01:27:55.360 --> 01:28:00.320]   I have a radical Christian father's question.
[01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:08.840]   So one thing I'm noticing at my church and other churches in this area in which I live
[01:28:08.840 --> 01:28:20.360]   where there are a lot of small church communities is they, I find myself connecting, connecting
[01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:21.360]   is the wrong word.
[01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:29.000]   I find myself relating to and having more in common with the women at the church because
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:38.240]   they are the ones leading their families and it's frustrating me to find the type of fellowship
[01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:44.440]   that I'm looking for in these groups of men because they seem to be following their wives
[01:28:44.440 --> 01:28:47.120]   and not the other way around.
[01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:53.120]   And I'm just curious, I'm assuming you run into that.
[01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:59.640]   You push that an awful lot when you did that podcast and I'm curious if you have any kind
[01:28:59.640 --> 01:29:04.440]   of, you know, me going and preaching to all these guys and saying, you guys are doing
[01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:05.440]   it wrong.
[01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:10.080]   I'm not going to make any friends that way and I'm not sure how to go about working around
[01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:13.520]   this difficulty I'm experiencing.
[01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:18.520]   Is there a particular denominational tradition that you yourself are involved in where you're
[01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:22.480]   finding this more than in another place?
[01:29:22.480 --> 01:29:33.320]   No, I go to a Catholic church and I went to, when I started back going, I went to pretty
[01:29:33.320 --> 01:29:37.720]   much every church that was within a half an hour of me.
[01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:47.200]   And I didn't stay long enough to say that this is definitive, but I see the women run
[01:29:47.200 --> 01:29:49.280]   a lot of the church operations.
[01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:54.400]   There are a few men that volunteer, typically older, retired gentlemen, but the guys with
[01:29:54.400 --> 01:29:58.080]   kids that are my age just aren't.
[01:29:58.080 --> 01:30:05.920]   And I felt as though I saw it as a general rule, don't get me wrong, there are exceptions
[01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:13.720]   just like I'm the exception in my mind, but I'm not seeing it any different if I go to,
[01:30:13.720 --> 01:30:18.600]   you know, a non-denominational church or however you want it to be called versus the one that
[01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:20.200]   I'm currently a member in.
[01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:27.480]   Right, well, it is, I can certainly easily understand what you're saying.
[01:30:27.480 --> 01:30:29.800]   It is a continual problem.
[01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:35.800]   It's not a problem everywhere though, but the reasoning strikes right at the heart of
[01:30:35.800 --> 01:30:43.880]   where we are as a culture and it's basically largely due to the cultural revolution in
[01:30:43.880 --> 01:30:50.520]   the United States and in many places of the various waves of feminism and it goes all
[01:30:50.520 --> 01:30:54.040]   the way back to the first part of the 20th century.
[01:30:54.040 --> 01:31:02.640]   But the responses to this change and vary depending on where you go and what you're
[01:31:02.640 --> 01:31:03.640]   exposed to, etc.
[01:31:03.640 --> 01:31:09.480]   And so there are, if you want to see more stronger men who are patriarchs of their family,
[01:31:09.480 --> 01:31:14.180]   there's a lot of us out there and in the future there will be a lot more, but there has been
[01:31:14.180 --> 01:31:17.720]   an enormous sifting happening.
[01:31:17.720 --> 01:31:20.640]   So I'll just tell my story briefly.
[01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:29.440]   Today I clearly and wholeheartedly identify with patriarchy, but it was not always that
[01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:30.440]   way.
[01:31:30.440 --> 01:31:38.480]   I grew up in a fairly conservative Christian world where male leadership was emphasized,
[01:31:38.480 --> 01:31:45.920]   but because of the cultural play, the cultural pressure in the wake of the feminist revolution,
[01:31:45.920 --> 01:31:55.440]   egalitarianism, etc., I was never super comfortable with that strong male approach.
[01:31:55.440 --> 01:32:01.480]   Specifically I remember one time when I was in college, and I wasn't a hardcore lefty
[01:32:01.480 --> 01:32:07.840]   or anything, but this pressure was really strong, including in Christian circles.
[01:32:07.840 --> 01:32:12.080]   And I remember I was in college one time and I went to my dad and I specifically rebuked
[01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:19.920]   my dad for some of his language, because instead of using gender-inclusive language, he had
[01:32:19.920 --> 01:32:23.120]   this thing that he said, and I'll skip the details, but he had this thing that he said
[01:32:23.120 --> 01:32:25.960]   that was specifically very exclusive.
[01:32:25.960 --> 01:32:26.960]   It was not gender-inclusive.
[01:32:26.960 --> 01:32:30.560]   And I said, "Dad, why do you have to say it that way?
[01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:34.280]   Why can't you say it in the more inclusive way?"
[01:32:34.280 --> 01:32:38.940]   And he wasn't offended, I don't even remember what he said, but anyway, years later I went
[01:32:38.940 --> 01:32:40.520]   back to him and I said, "Dad, you know what?
[01:32:40.520 --> 01:32:42.080]   You were completely right."
[01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:46.320]   And I was a fool for thinking of it, but it took me a decade to get there.
[01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:51.020]   It took me a decade of watching, it took me a decade of experience, it took me a decade.
[01:32:51.020 --> 01:32:54.320]   So specifically let's briefly touch on Christian doctrine.
[01:32:54.320 --> 01:33:02.320]   There are three basic views that we can categorize, that we can lump in together Christian views
[01:33:02.320 --> 01:33:12.680]   on male and female dynamics, and I think this would be a proper categorization that would
[01:33:12.680 --> 01:33:14.560]   include the vast majority.
[01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:18.120]   And you'll find many Christians in each of these three categories.
[01:33:18.120 --> 01:33:26.240]   So the first category is egalitarianism, and egalitarianism would say that there is no
[01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:32.720]   real difference between men and women, and therefore men and women can do all of the
[01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:37.980]   same things, men and women have all the same functions, there's no difference.
[01:33:37.980 --> 01:33:41.800]   After all, the Bible says there is now no more male and female, no more Jew and Greek,
[01:33:41.800 --> 01:33:45.960]   so therefore we're all the same, and that would be the egalitarian position.
[01:33:45.960 --> 01:33:54.440]   This would be very common in many specific Christian traditions, and I'll get to the
[01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:59.080]   causal factors of this in a moment, but most of the mainline Protestant denominations would
[01:33:59.080 --> 01:34:01.400]   have this position.
[01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:07.160]   Roman Catholicism is unique because you have from the top level, you do not have this at
[01:34:07.160 --> 01:34:12.120]   all, but there are strong elements within Roman Catholicism to see this change.
[01:34:12.120 --> 01:34:18.220]   The Anglican Church is now basically totally egalitarian, and so you go many places and
[01:34:18.220 --> 01:34:21.800]   you find women pastors and women everything, this, that, and the others.
[01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:24.660]   That's the egalitarian position.
[01:34:24.660 --> 01:34:27.880]   Then you have the complementarian position.
[01:34:27.880 --> 01:34:34.640]   The complementarian position, as best I can come out, as best I can figure it out, came
[01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:39.560]   out really in about the – that term started to be used – and by the way, to be clear,
[01:34:39.560 --> 01:34:43.120]   I'm no historical theologian, so if I'm wrong on this, this is just my best understanding
[01:34:43.120 --> 01:34:48.800]   at the moment – but that really came out in about the 1980s and 1990s, when you had
[01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:54.920]   a strong liberalizing influence from the mainline Christian denominations against broader evangelical
[01:34:54.920 --> 01:34:55.920]   Christianity.
[01:34:55.920 --> 01:34:58.880]   And again, remember the cultural context of this.
[01:34:58.880 --> 01:35:03.080]   We go all the way back to women's suffrage with the 13th Amendment in the United States,
[01:35:03.080 --> 01:35:07.160]   all of the first wave feminism, second wave feminism, all the way through, the strong
[01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:13.560]   feminist cultural movement invaded the Christian Church to a strong degree.
[01:35:13.560 --> 01:35:18.840]   And so that was where you started to have a lot of the Protestant denominations would
[01:35:18.840 --> 01:35:24.000]   say, "Yes, okay, we'll go ahead and we'll bow our knees to feminism, and we'll accept
[01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:25.480]   this movement."
[01:35:25.480 --> 01:35:31.480]   And then in response to that, you had basically the complementarian position start to be developed.
[01:35:31.480 --> 01:35:36.040]   And what complementarians want to do is they generally want to thread the needle, and they
[01:35:36.040 --> 01:35:37.260]   want to say this.
[01:35:37.260 --> 01:35:43.000]   They want to say that men and women are ontologically equal, meaning that in their being, in their
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:46.640]   personhood, they are equal in the eyes of God.
[01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:53.040]   But God has ordained functional differences between them, and that basically men and women
[01:35:53.040 --> 01:35:54.240]   are called differently.
[01:35:54.240 --> 01:36:01.240]   And so this would be the most, I think, widely represented position amongst a lot of evangelical
[01:36:01.240 --> 01:36:03.520]   Christianity.
[01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:08.360]   And I'm not as current on Roman Catholicism, but this would be widely represented there
[01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:10.540]   as well.
[01:36:10.540 --> 01:36:16.960]   So complementarism is, for a long time, I thought that was the conservative position.
[01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:24.960]   And about 10 years ago, I started thinking about patriarchy and all of the various issues,
[01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:29.480]   primarily because I was continually accused of patriarchy, right, down with the patriarchy
[01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:31.440]   and all the cultural movements.
[01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:34.840]   And in the beginning, I myself dismissed patriarchy.
[01:36:34.840 --> 01:36:39.480]   I was like, "I'm fine with complementarianism."
[01:36:39.480 --> 01:36:44.820]   But I started to think about it, and I started to read a little bit more, and I came to the
[01:36:44.820 --> 01:36:50.600]   conviction over time that, wait a second, complementarianism doesn't work because it
[01:36:50.600 --> 01:36:55.000]   doesn't—I wish I could articulate this further.
[01:36:55.000 --> 01:37:00.540]   It's the kind of thing that, in order to be proper, it needs thought to express properly.
[01:37:00.540 --> 01:37:04.420]   But I came to the conclusion that complementarianism was silly.
[01:37:04.420 --> 01:37:07.920]   Not silly because a lot of people believe in it, but I came to the conclusion that the
[01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:16.360]   Bible itself is patriarchal, and that a patriarchal society is the best-functioning society.
[01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:22.440]   And it's hard to express that in an appropriate way, given our current context, but it just
[01:37:22.440 --> 01:37:24.580]   simply works better.
[01:37:24.580 --> 01:37:29.280]   There are those who defend it as differently, but you look at the complete falling apart,
[01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:34.840]   you say, in many churches, in many parts of society, and to me, it's obvious evidence.
[01:37:34.840 --> 01:37:41.640]   So back to churches, the New Testament is crystal clear that all leadership in the church
[01:37:41.640 --> 01:37:45.800]   is to be male, but that's only defined to certain things.
[01:37:45.800 --> 01:37:50.160]   And so, for example, you'll say, well, some conservative denominations, right, the Southern
[01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:54.600]   Baptists will say, well, only preachers have to be men, but then they'll have women praying
[01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:59.200]   on stage, they'll have women leading worship, they'll have women doing all these things.
[01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:05.920]   And I kind of have this conclusion, I think I believe it, I'm pretty sure it's true, but
[01:38:05.920 --> 01:38:08.840]   basically, that men are just lazy.
[01:38:08.840 --> 01:38:15.880]   And the reason that God has instituted patriarchy in a scriptural context is to get men to do
[01:38:15.880 --> 01:38:16.880]   things.
[01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:21.480]   Because as a man, if I can sit back and just let my wife do something, that's the easiest
[01:38:21.480 --> 01:38:23.040]   thing in the world.
[01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:29.080]   But that leads to complete and total destruction of my family if I do that on an ongoing basis.
[01:38:29.080 --> 01:38:35.520]   And so if I weren't specifically commanded by God to lead, and that all of the responsibility
[01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:41.240]   is on my shoulders to do it, then I would probably be happy to sit back and not do so
[01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:42.240]   much.
[01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:46.760]   And what's remarkable to me is that it was about a decade ago that I came to that grudging
[01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:50.280]   realization that if it's to be, it's up to me, and I got to do this.
[01:38:50.280 --> 01:38:53.760]   And I've got to express, it's my responsibility.
[01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:57.040]   And I don't put anything on my wife, it's my responsibility.
[01:38:57.040 --> 01:38:59.120]   And that started to work good.
[01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:03.920]   What's been fascinating to me is I have watched very closely male and female dynamics over
[01:39:03.920 --> 01:39:09.400]   the last decade, and we see a complete collapse of dating culture, a complete collapse of
[01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:12.760]   relationship formation, a complete collapse of family formation.
[01:39:12.760 --> 01:39:17.160]   I'm talking broadly, not even just in Christianity, just across the culture.
[01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:24.600]   And I'm always amazed at the things that men and women thought they wanted that the feminist
[01:39:24.600 --> 01:39:26.880]   revolution didn't deliver.
[01:39:26.880 --> 01:39:32.480]   And I think we see a lot of response in people going kind of the direction that I've gone.
[01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:36.480]   And so there's a tendency often to try to soften that.
[01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:43.640]   There's a tendency to change and say, "Well, I'm a patriarch, but I don't say, 'Woman,
[01:39:43.640 --> 01:39:44.640]   get me a beer.'"
[01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:49.240]   I've tried to even stop qualifying, because I used to do all that stuff, and I realized
[01:39:49.240 --> 01:39:54.120]   that, "No, Joshua, just put the responsibility on yourself, be clear, and move forward."
[01:39:54.120 --> 01:39:58.400]   And so there are, I think, a lot of people, and I watch some of the Christian conversations,
[01:39:58.400 --> 01:40:02.420]   there are a lot of Christian conversations and people that come to that position.
[01:40:02.420 --> 01:40:03.600]   But there are a couple of problems.
[01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:07.920]   Number one, it's very uncomfortable, because it puts you out of the cultural norm.
[01:40:07.920 --> 01:40:14.760]   And so while I'm happy to respond honestly to a sincere question from you, it's not particularly
[01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:20.120]   comfortable for me to talk about this stuff in public.
[01:40:20.120 --> 01:40:21.600]   So a lot of guys aren't going to do it.
[01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:26.360]   Number two, it takes people a time to come to it, and also it takes a while for us to
[01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:28.800]   recognize what has happened.
[01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:31.540]   And so across Christendom, this is happening.
[01:40:31.540 --> 01:40:40.660]   But as women have become dominant in churches, it creates a major problem.
[01:40:40.660 --> 01:40:43.840]   They feminize the church experience.
[01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:47.880]   The pastors start preaching to women, which is repulsive to men.
[01:40:47.880 --> 01:40:51.680]   Then there are fewer men in the churches, and fewer men who are willing to actually
[01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:54.120]   step in and lead, so it becomes more feminine.
[01:40:54.120 --> 01:40:57.440]   And so then the whole experience of church becomes more feminine, and it just goes on
[01:40:57.440 --> 01:40:58.440]   and on and on.
[01:40:58.440 --> 01:41:03.660]   And I basically can't stand visiting or going to a lot of churches because of how effeminate
[01:41:03.660 --> 01:41:04.840]   they are.
[01:41:04.840 --> 01:41:08.600]   And the preachers themselves are often effeminate.
[01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:11.820]   They don't express any kind of admirable masculinity.
[01:41:11.820 --> 01:41:15.680]   They don't express any kind of – they're not men that you want to follow in the first
[01:41:15.680 --> 01:41:16.680]   place.
[01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:20.480]   They're so dominated by their wives and by the women in the church that they can't even
[01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:22.120]   stand up and preach.
[01:41:22.120 --> 01:41:25.020]   And I'll tell you – forgive me if I'm on a roll, but I'm trying to answer it forthrightly
[01:41:25.020 --> 01:41:28.680]   – here's where the clearest expression of this is.
[01:41:28.680 --> 01:41:30.760]   For me, it comes down to Father's Day.
[01:41:30.760 --> 01:41:35.280]   I've said this before, and I don't want to put poison, but it's really true, is that
[01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:40.360]   I think the worst day for men to ever go to church is on Father's Day.
[01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:42.980]   Basically men should never go to church on Father's Day.
[01:41:42.980 --> 01:41:46.980]   If you compare in most churches – and again, I'm not super involved in Roman Catholicism,
[01:41:46.980 --> 01:41:50.100]   I don't know what they preach about there – but in evangelical churches, if you go
[01:41:50.100 --> 01:41:57.380]   to church on Mother's Day, you will hear the most uplifting sermon about how wonderful
[01:41:57.380 --> 01:42:02.060]   our mothers are, and our mothers are wonderful, and we honor them, and they sacrifice for
[01:42:02.060 --> 01:42:03.060]   us, etc.
[01:42:03.060 --> 01:42:07.300]   And they're just so wonderful, and we appreciate them, and God has told us to honor our mothers.
[01:42:07.300 --> 01:42:12.620]   And the preacher goes on and on and on and on about how great women are, etc.
[01:42:12.620 --> 01:42:17.900]   You go to church on Father's Day, preacher stands up and says, "Men, we got to do better.
[01:42:17.900 --> 01:42:21.620]   After all, God has called you to be a man, and you're called to serve God, and so you
[01:42:21.620 --> 01:42:24.620]   have to love your family, and you have to serve your family, and whatnot."
[01:42:24.620 --> 01:42:29.840]   And he goes on for 60 minutes haranguing the men for not being good enough.
[01:42:29.840 --> 01:42:35.960]   Not a single bit of just respect and admiration for simply their maleness, their sexual identity
[01:42:35.960 --> 01:42:37.800]   of simply being men.
[01:42:37.800 --> 01:42:38.860]   And it's disgusting.
[01:42:38.860 --> 01:42:44.460]   And what happens is that that goes into these men, and it kind of creates the same thing
[01:42:44.460 --> 01:42:48.540]   that you're talking about, that you see, and it creates men who go through the world thinking
[01:42:48.540 --> 01:42:51.860]   that I don't measure up, I'm not worthy of respect because I got all this stuff wrong
[01:42:51.860 --> 01:42:53.020]   with me.
[01:42:53.020 --> 01:42:57.620]   And it's the same thing with our boys, it's the same thing with men, it's a complete catastrophe.
[01:42:57.620 --> 01:43:01.180]   So there are places where that, I think, is finally coming out, and where it's talked
[01:43:01.180 --> 01:43:02.660]   about, etc.
[01:43:02.660 --> 01:43:06.780]   But in order to find them, you've got to find a very conservative, you've got to find a
[01:43:06.780 --> 01:43:12.500]   conservative church, or a conservative denomination, and you've got to have a conservative denomination
[01:43:12.500 --> 01:43:15.180]   that is willing to stand on a couple things.
[01:43:15.180 --> 01:43:19.160]   Perhaps in your tradition, it would be the tradition of the church, but in general it
[01:43:19.160 --> 01:43:24.140]   has to do with believing in the authority and the inerrancy of Scripture.
[01:43:24.140 --> 01:43:28.660]   Because the New Testament, and the Old Testament, all the way through the Bible is absolutely
[01:43:28.660 --> 01:43:29.660]   patriarchal.
[01:43:29.660 --> 01:43:31.100]   I used to think it wasn't.
[01:43:31.100 --> 01:43:34.740]   I used to want to say, like, to the people who said, "Overthrow the patriarchy," I used
[01:43:34.740 --> 01:43:37.740]   to want to say, "Oh, well, you know, come on, the Bible raises up women."
[01:43:37.740 --> 01:43:38.980]   And all that stuff is true.
[01:43:38.980 --> 01:43:44.220]   Like, Jesus treated women much better, women are incredibly highly praised, Christianity
[01:43:44.220 --> 01:43:46.460]   revolutionized the world of women.
[01:43:46.460 --> 01:43:52.580]   It completely transformed the role of women in society on a complete basis.
[01:43:52.580 --> 01:43:56.900]   And so all that's interesting and true and completely irrelevant to where we are today.
[01:43:56.900 --> 01:44:00.380]   Today we've got to flip back to the other and recognize what the Scripture says.
[01:44:00.380 --> 01:44:04.500]   And so there are denominations where it's very clear.
[01:44:04.500 --> 01:44:10.380]   In Roman Catholicism, I would say you probably need to go to a Latin Mass.
[01:44:10.380 --> 01:44:14.100]   And if you find a Latin Mass, that's where you're going to find a lot of the men who
[01:44:14.100 --> 01:44:15.980]   are willing to stand up and lead.
[01:44:15.980 --> 01:44:26.100]   Because there's a flow of tradition that leads to the Latin Mass and all of that stuff that
[01:44:26.100 --> 01:44:28.340]   leads to men just saying, "Okay, I got to do it.
[01:44:28.340 --> 01:44:29.340]   I got to lead.
[01:44:29.340 --> 01:44:30.340]   I got to be strong.
[01:44:30.340 --> 01:44:31.700]   I got to take responsibility."
[01:44:31.700 --> 01:44:35.020]   In evangelical circles, there's a strong movement of that.
[01:44:35.020 --> 01:44:41.220]   In Reform circles, you can find it in a lot of fundamentalist gatherings.
[01:44:41.220 --> 01:44:45.020]   And so depending on kind of where you're going, basically you've got to find people who have
[01:44:45.020 --> 01:44:50.460]   a high view of Scripture and who are willing to submit themselves to what Scripture says.
[01:44:50.460 --> 01:44:55.860]   And I think that this is, in many ways, it's probably one of the biggest changes that is
[01:44:55.860 --> 01:44:57.860]   happening and will happen.
[01:44:57.860 --> 01:45:05.780]   Because in an appropriate relationship where men lead, to me it's obvious that women are
[01:45:05.780 --> 01:45:06.780]   happy.
[01:45:06.780 --> 01:45:12.780]   And when they're cared for and loved and lifted up, etc., and they're married to strong men,
[01:45:12.780 --> 01:45:16.460]   it leads to peace in the home and it passes on through the generations.
[01:45:16.460 --> 01:45:22.460]   I have almost no marriage problems, primarily because my entire life I grew up watching
[01:45:22.460 --> 01:45:27.820]   a happy, healthy marriage where my father was a strong man, my mother was a strong woman,
[01:45:27.820 --> 01:45:34.980]   they had a very clear hierarchy in the home, and watching the piece of that shows me how
[01:45:34.980 --> 01:45:35.980]   to do it.
[01:45:35.980 --> 01:45:42.300]   And so I try to—I'll finish with this—but what's frustrating a lot of times is that
[01:45:42.300 --> 01:45:47.300]   we often tend to be reactionary to the events of the day.
[01:45:47.300 --> 01:45:53.500]   And I especially am guilty of this—oh, sorry, I'm not guilty of this—so if somebody sees
[01:45:53.500 --> 01:45:58.620]   that, you know what, you're painting a building and the building is white and you're trying
[01:45:58.620 --> 01:46:02.060]   to get the building green.
[01:46:02.060 --> 01:46:05.660]   And one guy comes out and covers the building with red paint.
[01:46:05.660 --> 01:46:09.980]   Well, another guy comes out and starts using blue paint because he's trying to go the exact
[01:46:09.980 --> 01:46:10.980]   opposite direction.
[01:46:10.980 --> 01:46:13.700]   Now, at the end of the day, it winds up being green.
[01:46:13.700 --> 01:46:18.580]   But what happens in the meantime is that people get so latched on to a certain subject that
[01:46:18.580 --> 01:46:22.900]   they preach their message to an extreme degree.
[01:46:22.900 --> 01:46:27.660]   And a lot of times I think what we need to do is we need to understand why people are
[01:46:27.660 --> 01:46:31.420]   super hardcore about extremism, but just shoot straight up the middle.
[01:46:31.420 --> 01:46:36.900]   So to this subject, what you see right now is I see just some crazy stuff.
[01:46:36.900 --> 01:46:42.060]   Like you look—I follow the Manosphere and the Red Pill movement and whatnot, and I look
[01:46:42.060 --> 01:46:46.860]   at some of the guys, the things that these guys are doing, and the people who are popular,
[01:46:46.860 --> 01:46:51.380]   and I want nothing to do with them because they're a bunch of toxic—I'd like to use
[01:46:51.380 --> 01:46:53.100]   profane language—they're just toxic.
[01:46:53.100 --> 01:46:59.260]   I don't even know the smear that I could use that would express the feeling of my heart.
[01:46:59.260 --> 01:47:04.540]   And a lot of these guys, they're just—they're terrible human beings.
[01:47:04.540 --> 01:47:12.900]   And they put on this coat of masculinity, and it turns into slave drivers or just like
[01:47:12.900 --> 01:47:17.940]   a totally corrupt expression of this that I want nothing to do with.
[01:47:17.940 --> 01:47:22.460]   But then on the flip side, they think that it's only that, or roll over and wear your
[01:47:22.460 --> 01:47:24.460]   male feminist shirt.
[01:47:24.460 --> 01:47:25.640]   And it's just nonsense.
[01:47:25.640 --> 01:47:26.980]   You can do both.
[01:47:26.980 --> 01:47:30.000]   You can be a strong leader who is full of love.
[01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:34.100]   My favorite version of it is Aubrey Anderlin's Man of Steel and Velvet, and that's what I
[01:47:34.100 --> 01:47:35.100]   aspire to do.
[01:47:35.100 --> 01:47:39.820]   I want to be a man of absolute steel, and I want to be a man of velvet, because that's
[01:47:39.820 --> 01:47:41.460]   who Jesus was.
[01:47:41.460 --> 01:47:44.380]   And that is, to me, the aspiration that we have.
[01:47:44.380 --> 01:47:49.380]   And it may be that we have to, at this stage in time, we have to have a little bit more
[01:47:49.380 --> 01:47:54.900]   steel than we necessarily used to have, but it can change.
[01:47:54.900 --> 01:48:00.580]   And what is amazing is—what I think will happen in the future is every—sorry, I'm
[01:48:00.580 --> 01:48:07.340]   too long, but here's my final comment—all female-dominated churches eventually wither
[01:48:07.340 --> 01:48:08.900]   up and blow away.
[01:48:08.900 --> 01:48:11.020]   And there are a few basic reasons for that.
[01:48:11.020 --> 01:48:18.480]   Number one, men can attract men into church.
[01:48:18.480 --> 01:48:24.500]   Male-dominated churches can attract women, but female-dominated churches do not attract
[01:48:24.500 --> 01:48:25.500]   men.
[01:48:25.500 --> 01:48:26.500]   They repulse men.
[01:48:26.500 --> 01:48:31.180]   And so I have found that a lot of the strongest men don't even bother to go to church.
[01:48:31.180 --> 01:48:32.460]   They go other places.
[01:48:32.460 --> 01:48:35.140]   They still have their beliefs, but they're forming other communities, because the churches
[01:48:35.140 --> 01:48:37.180]   themselves are just repulsive.
[01:48:37.180 --> 01:48:38.180]   And it's everything.
[01:48:38.180 --> 01:48:39.620]   And it's people they don't even realize.
[01:48:39.620 --> 01:48:45.020]   It's effeminate music, it's effeminate pastors, it's pastors unwilling to tackle hard subjects,
[01:48:45.020 --> 01:48:46.020]   etc.
[01:48:46.020 --> 01:48:51.100]   Also, female-dominated churches often tend to collapse because they don't execute church
[01:48:51.100 --> 01:48:52.380]   discipline.
[01:48:52.380 --> 01:48:55.900]   Women do not want to execute church discipline.
[01:48:55.900 --> 01:48:57.580]   They don't want to excommunicate people.
[01:48:57.580 --> 01:48:59.700]   They don't want to bring discipline on their members.
[01:48:59.700 --> 01:49:03.380]   And then because of that, people—everything gets accepted.
[01:49:03.380 --> 01:49:08.180]   And when everything gets accepted, we stand for nothing, and the whole thing collapses.
[01:49:08.180 --> 01:49:13.780]   And so basically in the fullness of—and then what happens, it gets worse, is you attract
[01:49:13.780 --> 01:49:17.820]   more women, it becomes more and more feminized, it becomes more and more feminized, you have
[01:49:17.820 --> 01:49:24.180]   fewer men, and basically the pastor is preaching to a congregation of 70% women, women who
[01:49:24.180 --> 01:49:27.360]   come without their husbands, single women, etc.
[01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:31.660]   There's 30% men, but the 30% men themselves are not very masculine and strong, and eventually
[01:49:31.660 --> 01:49:32.660]   the thing falls apart.
[01:49:32.660 --> 01:49:36.780]   The problem is it takes decades and centuries for that to happen, but you've seen that happen
[01:49:36.780 --> 01:49:41.380]   clearly in evangelical Christianity in the United States with the absolute collapse of
[01:49:41.380 --> 01:49:43.540]   mainline Protestant denominations.
[01:49:43.540 --> 01:49:49.740]   So it can go the other way, though, is that when men get clear and they start to express
[01:49:49.740 --> 01:49:55.380]   themselves in a masculine way, and they start to talk about masculine things, it changes
[01:49:55.380 --> 01:49:58.380]   everything, and it's attractive to men.
[01:49:58.380 --> 01:50:01.620]   And when it's attractive to men, it's attractive to women, and those churches grow.
[01:50:01.620 --> 01:50:05.300]   And I could point to various denominations, I could point to various churches where you
[01:50:05.300 --> 01:50:10.340]   see that happening across the United States, and it's actually influencing a lot of the
[01:50:10.340 --> 01:50:13.540]   public debates, etc.
[01:50:13.540 --> 01:50:18.660]   And it leads to even things, I mean, again, have you ever been, I'll stop with it, but
[01:50:18.660 --> 01:50:21.460]   have you gone to a Latin Mass in the Roman Catholic tradition?
[01:50:21.460 --> 01:50:24.900]   No, not for a long time.
[01:50:24.900 --> 01:50:31.260]   You should go to a Latin Mass and compare it to the vernacular Mass that you may attend,
[01:50:31.260 --> 01:50:36.660]   and what I would bet you, here's a cold drink on my tab the next time we see you.
[01:50:36.660 --> 01:50:41.380]   You go to the Latin Mass, you'll see families that are about three times more common and
[01:50:41.380 --> 01:50:46.820]   much bigger, you'll see a lot more men, you'll see a lot more people who are serious about
[01:50:46.820 --> 01:50:48.580]   their faith, etc.
[01:50:48.580 --> 01:50:55.980]   It's just obvious from just watching them walk in, and what you will see is, you'll
[01:50:55.980 --> 01:50:58.020]   see what you're looking for if you go to there.
[01:50:58.020 --> 01:51:02.100]   And again, there are evangelical denominations, the same thing.
[01:51:02.100 --> 01:51:06.820]   But you're right that it is a significant thing that's happening across the culture,
[01:51:06.820 --> 01:51:10.580]   and it is affecting Christianity in a strong way.
[01:51:10.580 --> 01:51:14.220]   But there are out there, there are plenty of guys out there who are recognizing their
[01:51:14.220 --> 01:51:19.380]   responsibility, who are stepping up, and who are changing things.
[01:51:19.380 --> 01:51:20.500]   It's affecting the women too.
[01:51:20.500 --> 01:51:26.700]   The women feel the same way, a woman I was speaking with last time, she was poo-pooing
[01:51:26.700 --> 01:51:37.460]   the softness of Vatican II and all the speech, you know, all the easiness that got implemented
[01:51:37.460 --> 01:51:41.420]   when that came through the church, and how she wanted it to be, you know, where's the
[01:51:41.420 --> 01:51:47.980]   fasting, where's the penance, where's this all going, and where's the softness coming
[01:51:47.980 --> 01:51:48.980]   from?
[01:51:48.980 --> 01:51:54.300]   And we were talking about attending, it's a good suggestion, an Eastern Church service
[01:51:54.300 --> 01:52:01.260]   for that same reason, you know, where you're standing the whole time, and yeah, anyhow,
[01:52:01.260 --> 01:52:07.180]   I knew I'd get you going, I appreciate it, and it gives me a good place to start.
[01:52:07.180 --> 01:52:11.980]   And I intend to have these difficult conversations with the men around here, and I'm not the
[01:52:11.980 --> 01:52:17.500]   only guy that wants to have that conversation, and that wants to put that group together.
[01:52:17.500 --> 01:52:21.660]   And so I think, like you say, keep looking.
[01:52:21.660 --> 01:52:27.420]   One more, just like little data point.
[01:52:27.420 --> 01:52:34.480]   When I was growing up, I had zero exposure to Eastern Orthodoxy, zero.
[01:52:34.480 --> 01:52:37.860]   If somebody had asked me what it was, I didn't have a clue.
[01:52:37.860 --> 01:52:43.060]   I knew what evangelicals or Protestants were, I knew Roman Catholics, I had friends who
[01:52:43.060 --> 01:52:44.060]   were both.
[01:52:44.060 --> 01:52:46.980]   I didn't know anybody who was Eastern Orthodox.
[01:52:46.980 --> 01:52:53.580]   Over the last five years, I see nothing but Eastern Orthodox stuff, and I think this is
[01:52:53.580 --> 01:52:59.700]   a big reason, because finding liberal traditions within Orthodoxy is very much harder to find
[01:52:59.700 --> 01:53:03.620]   than it is in Roman Catholicism or in Protestantism.
[01:53:03.620 --> 01:53:11.220]   And the people that I watch who are attracted to Eastern Orthodoxy are generally strong
[01:53:11.220 --> 01:53:16.220]   masculine guys who just recognize how toxic so much of the rest of it is.
[01:53:16.220 --> 01:53:19.820]   And so, to your point, it's that there's something interesting.
[01:53:19.820 --> 01:53:25.180]   I ran into an Orthodox priest in an airport recently, and I was talking to him, and there's
[01:53:25.180 --> 01:53:31.460]   something about it where their tradition is attracting people for this specific reason.
[01:53:31.460 --> 01:53:35.340]   And I think what people are finding is that their doctrinal convictions in many cases
[01:53:35.340 --> 01:53:39.700]   are quite fluid, and they're more visceral than they are intellectual.
[01:53:39.700 --> 01:53:44.940]   And so it's interesting for theologians to sit around and argue about our distinctions
[01:53:44.940 --> 01:53:49.260]   and our doctrinal understandings among branches of Christianity and all of our denominations.
[01:53:49.260 --> 01:53:54.900]   But at the end of the day, most people don't have the patience for that, and they go where
[01:53:54.900 --> 01:53:57.820]   they feel something, and I mean that on a visceral level.
[01:53:57.820 --> 01:54:00.780]   Does this outfit have a future, as Gary North used to say?
[01:54:00.780 --> 01:54:02.340]   Are we going somewhere?
[01:54:02.340 --> 01:54:06.060]   And it's pretty obvious that some places are going somewhere and some places aren't, and
[01:54:06.060 --> 01:54:11.340]   that's what you can feel without even digging into the doctrine at all.
[01:54:11.340 --> 01:54:12.340]   Yeah.
[01:54:12.340 --> 01:54:13.340]   All right.
[01:54:13.340 --> 01:54:15.060]   Well, thank you very much.
[01:54:15.060 --> 01:54:16.060]   Yes.
[01:54:16.060 --> 01:54:17.060]   Thank you.
[01:54:17.060 --> 01:54:18.060]   All right.
[01:54:18.060 --> 01:54:19.060]   My pleasure.
[01:54:19.060 --> 01:54:20.060]   Fun questions.
[01:54:20.060 --> 01:54:21.060]   Like we said, Open Line Friday.
[01:54:21.060 --> 01:54:22.060]   Had two other callers that jumped off.
[01:54:22.060 --> 01:54:23.060]   That's fine.
[01:54:23.060 --> 01:54:24.060]   A two-hour show is plenty.
[01:54:24.060 --> 01:54:26.660]   I hope you enjoyed today's Friday Q&A show.
[01:54:26.660 --> 01:54:27.860]   Remember, these shows are open to you.
[01:54:27.860 --> 01:54:28.860]   I'll do my best.
[01:54:28.860 --> 01:54:31.940]   I'll always answer honestly, even when it's difficult, or even if you want to talk about
[01:54:31.940 --> 01:54:37.500]   the patriarchy, down with the patriarchy, smash the patriarchy, or promote the patriarchy.
[01:54:37.500 --> 01:54:39.620]   We'll try to answer honestly.
[01:54:39.620 --> 01:54:45.700]   So if you'd like to join me on next week's show, just go to patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance.
[01:54:45.700 --> 01:54:50.300]   Remember last few days, sign up for the event in Panama, expatmoney.com/radical.
[01:54:50.300 --> 01:54:55.100]   Sign up for the event that I'm hosting in Panama, expatmoney.com/radical.
[01:54:55.100 --> 01:55:04.060]   Answered several questions today on infrastructure, and ironically, I didn't plant the questions,
[01:55:04.060 --> 01:55:08.020]   but I've been thinking about that because I think I'm going to release a little mini
[01:55:08.020 --> 01:55:09.420]   course here.
[01:55:09.420 --> 01:55:12.540]   Part of it basically just like resetting your financial infrastructure.
[01:55:12.540 --> 01:55:18.120]   So today's show motivates me to get that done here more quickly, and I think if this was
[01:55:18.120 --> 01:55:26.020]   useful for you, any of these infrastructure questions, keep your ears open for that course
[01:55:26.020 --> 01:55:27.860]   that hopefully will come out soon.
[01:55:27.860 --> 01:55:30.740]   And those of you who have been waiting on the retirement course to be finished, I'm
[01:55:30.740 --> 01:55:31.740]   still working on it.
[01:55:31.740 --> 01:55:39.220]   Just want to make a good version B, the non-beta version coming out, non-beta, the alpha version.
[01:55:39.220 --> 01:55:40.220]   Thank you for listening.
[01:55:40.220 --> 01:55:41.220]   Have a great weekend.
[01:55:41.220 --> 01:56:09.940]   Talk with you very soon.
[01:56:09.940 --> 01:56:20.780]   Bye.
