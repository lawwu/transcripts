[00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.620]   We'll start, as always, with questions about deep work.
[00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.900]   Our first question comes from Sabine, who asks,
[00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.320]   in your opinion, is it worth time blocking days
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.920]   that don't involve jumping around
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.160]   with different types of tasks?
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.080]   There's some elaboration here.
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.520]   Sabine says, I am self-employed and on a regular basis
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.280]   have days when I work on my routine work projects that
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.200]   can take two days to finish without having
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.760]   to switch to anything else.
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.280]   I think that's completely fine to non-time block really
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.840]   focused days, or days where maybe you're not
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.800]   doing too much professionally, except for maybe one thing.
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.440]   So it's a weekend day that you largely aren't working,
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.520]   but you're going to write for three hours.
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.640]   No need to time block that.
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.760]   Or if it's a regular weekday and you're coding all day,
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:56.920]   you know what you're doing.
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.600]   You use Scrum, here's the feature story
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.880]   you're working on, and that's what you're locked into.
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.800]   I think the time block in those occasions,
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.720]   though it's fine to do, might feel like it's
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.800]   an exercise in just formalism.
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.160]   I think it's completely fine not to time block those days.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.800]   I probably time block 90% of my work days.
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.040]   But there's work days I don't have to.
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.080]   I mean, sometimes it's because it's routine, too.
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.620]   That's the other thing I'll throw in.
[00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.360]   I mean, I know if it's a Monday for me,
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.200]   I got to drive to campus, I'm going to teach,
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.120]   then teaching is followed almost immediately by office hours.
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.240]   And then office hours actually take me pretty late
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.840]   into the day, and sometimes it's pretty clear.
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.640]   I prep in the morning, I go to campus, I teach,
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.560]   I do office hours.
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.760]   I'll often have maybe one variable block in that day.
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.440]   What do I do right after office hours?
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.440]   And sometimes if that's the only variable that's different,
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.960]   it feels weird to write it down.
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.960]   So I'm with you.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.360]   Time blocking is useful when it's
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.520]   unclear what you want to do with your time,
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.080]   or your plan is way too complicated to keep track of.
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.400]   But if it's one thing, or it's a schedule
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.780]   you've done week after week after week with very minimal
[00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:05.960]   changes, it's fine by me.
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.680]   I'm not going to be mad at you if you don't time block that.
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.040]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
