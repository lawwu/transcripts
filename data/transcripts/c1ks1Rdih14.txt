[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640]   There seems to be a bit of a vibe shift happening in tech.
[00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.120]   Two great examples this week.
[00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.120]   - I think one of my great advantages
[00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.040]   is that I have very low expectations.
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.000]   People with very high expectations have very low resilience
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.400]   and unfortunately, resilience matters in success.
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.440]   I don't know how to teach it to you
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.320]   except for I hope suffering happens to you.
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.800]   - I love burning the short sellers.
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.000]   Like almost nothing makes a human happier
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   than taking the lines of (beep)
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.440]   away from these short sellers who are going short
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.820]   on a truly great American company, not just ours,
[00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.680]   but I just love pulling down great American companies
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.160]   so that they can pay for their (beep)
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.960]   - It seems like a lot of people are less worried
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.040]   about cancel culture as they were three years ago.
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.480]   People are speaking their mind more,
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.160]   which is positive and refreshing.
