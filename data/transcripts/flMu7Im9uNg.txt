[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.680]   What is hyper-Calvinism and how do we avoid it? It's a question from a
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.040]   listener named Andrew. Hello Pastor John and thank you for this podcast. In the
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.880]   wake of your helpful new book, Coronavirus and Christ, one theologian
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.080]   said of you, "Piper's thinking is sometimes Calvinism raised to the nth
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.280]   power. That's not where it belongs." I disagree. I think that's exactly
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.280]   where it belongs. An elevated and consistent Calvinism maintained
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:37.040]   throughout one's entire ministry from private devotions to the pulpit and into
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.920]   those rare moments when the Christian is called to speak into current events. For
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.520]   your model of consistency, I thank God. As for myself, I was recently called a
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.700]   hyper-Calvinist by someone online for something I said. There's no need to go
[00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.920]   into exactly what I said. I simply want to know from you, what is a hyper-Calvinist?
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.120]   Is that what you're being accused of? When does Calvinism go wrong? How do we
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.080]   sustain our strong Calvinistic convictions to the nth degree without
[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.160]   slipping into hyper-Calvinism? Pastor John, what would you say? Let me state the
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:18.600]   absolutely crucial thing here first and then back up to the specific question
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.400]   and then circle back again at the end and end on the absolutely crucial thing.
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:30.160]   So, in my judgment, the absolutely crucial thing is that we submit all of our
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:36.360]   thinking to what the Bible teaches—all of the Bible. Not just select parts of it,
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:45.160]   but all of it, rightly understood—the whole counsel of God. And when I say
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:52.320]   submit our thinking to what the Bible teaches, I include bringing our thinking
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.480]   into biblical balance as well as biblical truthfulness. Wherever someone
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:06.000]   stands on any issue, it is possible to emphasize that issue to the exclusion of
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:14.640]   other issues. And in that sense, any issue may become a hyper-issue, meaning an
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:22.280]   over-emphasis on some part of the Bible that silences other important parts of
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.800]   the Bible. That's hyper—hyper-anything. So that's the absolutely crucial thing.
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:35.040]   Believe and teach what the whole Bible, rightly understood, teaches, and believe
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:42.360]   it and teach it in biblical proportion, biblical balance, so that no scripture is
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:50.800]   used to silence the meaning and importance of other scriptures. So now to
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:57.320]   the specific question, what is hyper-Calvinism? I think probably the most
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:05.240]   common historic meaning for the term is that hyper-Calvinism refers to a
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:12.760]   distortion of historic Calvinism, and the distortion says—remember now, I'm reading a
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:20.780]   distortion—the distortion says it is inappropriate and unbiblical to invite
[00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:27.360]   people to Christ unless they give some evidence of being among the elect. That's
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:34.440]   a distortion, that's a falsehood. And the net effect of this viewpoint is to put a
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.920]   governor on the indiscriminate preaching of the gospel and the wholehearted
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.500]   engagement in world missions. You can hear it in the voice of a preacher who
[00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.080]   when William Carey wanted to go to India said, "Sit down, young man, when God wants
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.600]   to reach the nations, he'll do it without your help." In other words, don't you go
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.600]   out there and preach the gospel indiscriminately to those pagans? You
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.880]   might, you know, tempt somebody to embrace the gospel when they're not
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:06.080]   elect. That's hyper-Calvinism. In other words, the emphasis is put so
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:13.840]   completely on the unconditional election of God and the spiritual deadness of man
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.120]   and the sovereignty of grace in conversion, all of which are true. The
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:27.040]   emphasis is put so heavily on those three that the irrational and unbiblical
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:35.960]   inference is drawn, namely, that we should not say to any non-elect person who's
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:41.560]   spiritually dead, "Repent, believe, come to Christ." We should never preach like that.
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.720]   We should never indiscriminately say to a whole crowd of people, many of whom
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.880]   would be non-elect, "Come to Christ, repent, believe." Now the reason I say that's
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:58.760]   irrational and unbiblical, to draw that inference from election and deadness and
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:07.160]   sovereign grace, is this. It's irrational because nothing in reason says that
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:16.280]   summoning a spiritually dead sinner to repent might not be the means God uses
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:22.240]   to perform the miracle of making him alive, and thus demonstrating he is elect.
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:30.600]   And I say it's unbiblical because the Bible tells us, "Preach the gospel to
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:38.520]   everyone, and the sheep will hear the shepherd's voice in the preaching and
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:47.360]   follow him." John 10:27. So our job is not to know ahead of time who the sheep are.
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:54.520]   Our job is to preach the unsearchable riches of Christ, pray for converting
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:06:02.280]   power, and plead for people to repent and trust God. Trust him to do his
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:10.240]   regenerating work. God raises the dead. He raises the dead, and he grants faith, and
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:16.280]   he does it through preaching. So we're supposed to say precisely to dead bones,
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:22.640]   "Live! Live! Why would you die?" That's the way we should preach indiscriminately to
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:27.000]   all people, offering the gospel to everyone and trusting God to call his
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:34.640]   own. Now, here's another contemporary form of hyper-Calvinism that is common among
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:42.720]   some Reformed groups. Just like the old hyper-Calvinism was hesitant to offer
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:50.280]   gospel salvation to someone who might not be elect, so this contemporary form
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:56.600]   of hyper-Calvinism is hesitant to offer gospel assurance to professing
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:03.160]   Christians who might not be elect. Now, I had a conversation with a man who held
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:09.520]   this view recently in one of my trips, and my conclusion was this. He so
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:17.400]   emphasized the danger of giving false assurance to possibly fake Christians
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:24.160]   that he preached in such a way as to withhold true assurance from real
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:30.840]   Christians. That's how a good concern becomes a hyper-concern. And you
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:36.580]   can smell it, because the tone of the congregation is not the tone of Romans
[00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:44.760]   8, which is so radically bent on helping Christians be gloriously bold in their
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:51.560]   assurance that nothing can separate us from the love of God in Christ. So those
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:59.440]   are two forms of hyper-Calvinism, and the way to avoid both of them is Bible,
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:09.960]   Bible, Bible. The whole Bible, unashamed, uncompromising, in biblical balance. So my
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:16.000]   response to somebody who says, "Piper takes his Calvinism to the nth degree,
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:24.560]   nth power," my response to that would be to say, "Well, nth degree has no meaning to
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:32.200]   me. It has no content. You can't know if it's true. I can't know if it's true or
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:37.080]   false, what they're saying, because it doesn't carry any meaning." The
[00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:45.800]   question is, does Piper submit his so-called Calvinism to the Bible? Does he
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:51.240]   bring it into alignment with the truth of the whole Bible? Does he bring it into
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:57.280]   balance with the way the Bible teaches the sovereignty of God? Does Piper—here
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:01.400]   are the key questions, and I invite everybody to ask them of me and of
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:07.720]   everything I've ever said—does Piper silence important biblical teachings by
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:15.040]   his Calvinism? Does Piper silence the responsibility of man? Does he silence
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:21.480]   the reality of secondary causes like Satan and sinful man in the suffering
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:26.680]   and sin of the world? Does he silence the reality of the Holy Spirit and that the
[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:32.880]   Holy Spirit can be grieved, or that Jesus wept over Jerusalem? Does he silence the
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:38.800]   biblical reality that we should hold our hands out to a world bent on destruction
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:46.760]   and plead with them with tears to repent? If Piper uses his Calvinism to silence
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:53.120]   truth, true and important biblical teachings, then Piper is moving into
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:59.320]   hyper-Calvinism. Now whether that's happening is not helped or clarified at
[00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:06.840]   all by saying Piper's Calvinism is to the nth degree. What use is that? But
[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:11.840]   here's where the rubber meets the road. It often comes down to being thoroughly
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:19.200]   biblical versus silencing Scripture with philosophical assumptions. The modern
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:26.000]   world operates with the philosophical assumption that human willpower has the
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:34.720]   capacity for ultimate, final, decisive self-determination in the moment of
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:42.600]   conversion to Christ. That is the reigning modern philosophical assumption.
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:48.120]   When I say modern, I mean say two, three hundred years. Whatever divine influences
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:56.240]   there are, the modern world says we, we humans, provide the final, ultimate,
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:04.880]   decisive cause in our conversion to Christ. That assumption, then, is brought
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:09.680]   to the Bible. It's not found in the Bible. You can't find that assumption anywhere
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:16.280]   in the Bible. That assumption, that assertion, is brought to the Bible and it
[00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:23.440]   causes many people to call Calvinism hyper-Calvinism. By labeling it
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:31.040]   hyper-Calvinism, by labeling ordinary Bible-balanced Calvinism hyper-Calvinism,
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:36.320]   you can blow smoke over the clear biblical reality that there is no such
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:42.000]   thing in the Bible or in the world as ultimate, final, decisive human
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.480]   self-determination in conversion to Christ. So we end back where we started
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:54.280]   with the main thing. Bible, Bible, Bible. Not philosophy, not philosophy, not
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:12:00.240]   assumptions, not modern American love affair with free will. No, no, no. Bible,
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:07.680]   Bible, Bible. Not modern assumptions, not the darling of human self-determination
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:14.960]   in conversion, but Bible, the whole counsel of God in biblical proportion.
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:21.240]   Amen. The Bible and all of it. Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for listening.

[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:44.200]   Well, recessions are killjoys. They destroy small businesses, they disrupt life, they
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:50.560]   take away our normalcy, and they seem to cost us our happiness. Or do they? So what
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:54.040]   has God up to in this recession? We'll find out by reviewing what John Pepper
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:58.480]   said in the last recession. With that, we're back on Wednesday. Until then, I'm
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:02.280]   Tony Reinke. We'll see you next time.
