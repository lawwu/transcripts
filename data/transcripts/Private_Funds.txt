[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400]   Hello, everybody. It's Sam from Financial Samurai. And in this episode, I'm going to
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:10.040]   talk about private funds and why I invest in private funds and why you might want to
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:16.080]   invest in private funds as well. So, so far in 2022, the public stock market has done
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.040]   terribly, right? It's down about 10% at the time of this recording. Nasdaq's down worse.
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:29.800]   There are individual stocks like MetaFacebook, Roku, PayPal, so many of these tech names
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.280]   that are really popular, have been really popular over the past several years, have
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.760]   completely round-tripped over the past one, two years. Now, we all know that investing
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.260]   in the S&P 500, the Nasdaq, the Dow Jones, the basically major indices, generally tends
[00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:51.160]   to do well over the long run. And if you can invest in a low-cost index fund or ETF, even
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:57.000]   better, right? Because those fees really drag down returns. And when you invest in a private
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.880]   fund, for example, I invested in a Kleiner Perkins Venture Fund, actually invested in
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:07.360]   two funds, the Kleiner Perkins 20 and the Kleiner Perkins Select 2 Fund. Now, this is
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:14.840]   venture capital, early stage growth investing. So risky. However, it's very different from
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.500]   the public markets, right? You're investing at a different stage in a company's growth
[00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.240]   curve. Now, investing in these two private funds does not come cheap. The management
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:33.680]   fee is 1.5% to 2.5%. But it fades over time. And the funds charge 20% to 30% of profits.
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.760]   It's called carry. And that increases after a return hurdle has been met. So in other
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.520]   words, if you want to make a lot of money, folks, you had best become a venture capitalist
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.400]   with a lot of assets under management. Join one of the big firms. You're probably going
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.680]   to do very well because, frankly, the limited partners, that's what I am, investors in the
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:02:00.400]   fund won't really know how well you're doing until maybe year 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. By then,
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.920]   you've collected a lot of fees, and you probably have opened up another fund. But this is not
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.120]   a podcast episode on where you should work to make the most amount of money. This is
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:14.880]   an episode to talk about why you might want to consider investing in private funds in
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.640]   your diversified portfolio and net worth. So let me just share seven reasons. The first
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:27.560]   reason diversification and potential outperformance. The majority of investors should invest 80%
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.080]   to 100% of their public investment capital in low cost index ETFs or funds. At the end
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.160]   of the day, it's very hard to outperform any index, roughly 80% of active fund managers
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:44.840]   underperform their respective indices over a 10 year period. However, if you just invest
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:51.360]   in index funds, you're never going to be able to outperform index fund investors and building
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.760]   wealth is about trying to outperform your peers. So you can use that money to improve
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.760]   the quality of your life and buy more things, I guess. If you invest in a private fund,
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.120]   let's say venture capital fund, who knows it could find the next Google or Facebook,
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.920]   and you could have outstanding returns or an outstanding IRR for the life of the fund.
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.680]   But if you don't invest in such funds, you're never going to be able to outperform. Sure,
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.480]   the chances are low that you're going to outperform, but you're never going to outperform if you
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:28.720]   just hug the index. Two, more gains are accruing to private investors. This is actually very
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.440]   important. Private funds like venture capital funds are investing in earlier stages of a
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.880]   company's life. And if the fund is able to identify a promising company early, the returns
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:45.200]   could be massive. Companies are going public, they're going IPO later and later in their
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:52.600]   company's life cycle. So for example, Microsoft went public for $777 million in 1986. That's
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:58.160]   equivalent to about 1.9 billion in market cap in today's dollars. Meanwhile, Uber went
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:04.720]   public in May 2019, with a market capitalization of 82 billion. And if you look at a company
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:10.920]   like Stripe, the fintech payments company, it's roughly valued at 100 billion, but some
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:16.960]   people have told me it's valued at 200 billion. Now, as a retail investor, you're going to
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:23.400]   go buy the company valued between 100 to $200 billion, with growth rates not as fast as
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.840]   they were in the beginning years. I would say good luck to that. Good luck to that.
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:35.200]   I own Amazon stock. It's one and a half trillion market cap company. It is highly unlikely
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.760]   it's going to be a big outperformer going forward due to the large numbers. I'd rather
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.440]   invest some capital in smaller companies that could take market share or reinvent the market
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.480]   altogether. All right, let's look at the third reason why you might want to invest in private
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:55.200]   funds. Dampen portfolio volatility. The more capital you have, the more you worry about
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:01.200]   loss. As a result, you seek to dampen your portfolio's volatility with private investments.
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:06.840]   Since private funds do not have a daily market value update, unlike publicly traded stocks,
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:12.280]   you may go under the illusion that your private fund investments are more stable. As a private
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:17.360]   fund investor, you're going to get a monthly, quarterly, and at least yearly update. So
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:23.360]   it's not every single day. And that can really put a damper on your psyche, on your day to
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:29.680]   day mood. If you have a lot of money invested in the stock market, for example. For me personally,
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.800]   the reason why I have no more than 35% of my net worth in stocks is because any more
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.640]   and I start really getting bummed out because I've already done the math and I've gone through
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:45.680]   many bear markets before since 1997, the Asian financial crisis. And I know myself. So you've
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:51.440]   got to know yourself. And if you don't like volatility, especially as you get wealthier,
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.240]   private funds help really dampen that volatility. All right, reason number four, you gain access
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:02.320]   to investments you simply don't have. So any of us can buy any stock and pretty much any
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:08.720]   bond we want to for no fees, you know. However, not everybody can invest in a promising private
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:14.040]   company without connections and a glowing reputation. There's a ton of liquidity out
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:18.760]   there chasing the best private companies. And by investing in a private fund with experienced
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:26.240]   operators, you gain access to their deal flow. So paying that fee is gaining access to people's
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:31.960]   connections that you otherwise don't have. Our fifth reason to invest in private funds,
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:36.600]   the opportunity to co invest. So sometimes when a private fund invests in a company,
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:42.320]   the company may offer up the opportunity for the limited partners to co invest. Co investing
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:47.360]   is when the limited partner directly invests additional capital in the company alongside
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.400]   that fund, right? It's a co. So for example, let's say, you know, the client of Perkins
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:56.840]   20 fund leads a 40 million series A round in a hot fintech startup in San Francisco.
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:01.880]   And then the fintech CEO asks, you know, KP 20s managing partner whether his fund has
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:08.720]   any limited partners who could be very synergistic and help him or her grow his business. And
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.840]   then the managing partner says, Hey, I know this guy named Sam who runs financial samurai,
[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:17.760]   a well read personal finance site with a million readers a month, who could help promote your
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:24.800]   product if he sees a good fit. They connect me to the founder, I like the business, I
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:29.540]   write about it, and it's just a win win. And I just disclosed I'm an investor in this company.
[00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:35.160]   So if you are also a savvy investor, and you believe, wow, the fund has really identified
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:41.840]   a great individual investment, you can add more capital to press your bets. All right,
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:46.240]   that's sixth reason to invest in private funds. And this is something I don't think many people
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:52.600]   think about, you have more opportunities to network. I personally don't really like networking
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:58.240]   for networking sake, I just like to meet people who I, you know, when I play tennis or softball.
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:03.040]   But once you invest in a private fund, you join a family of limited partners with similar
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:07.320]   goals, right goal is to make money in that fund. But goal is to invest in the things
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:13.840]   the fund cares about. If you need some advice, want a warm introduction, or need to get some
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:19.160]   deal done, you might have an easier time getting some help from another limited partner. Heck,
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:24.000]   if COVID ever goes away, which I think it soon will in 2022, fingers crossed, there
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.360]   might even be a holiday party for the limited partners. So being a fellow limited partner
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:34.360]   acts as a screening mechanism, right? One, you need enough capital to invest in the fund.
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:38.880]   Two, you need to know people to be able to invest in that fund. So it's kind of like
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:43.680]   being more responsive to alumni of your school, they seek your help, you know, through a cold
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:48.240]   email or whatnot, you're probably going to be more likely to respond, right? Because
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:53.320]   you want to help the community that helped you. It's just natural human nature. And if
[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:59.360]   the private fund actually does well, you have the immediate ability to invest in the next
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:04.240]   fund and in the next one. So imagine if you started with Sequoia, which is the preeminent
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:09.840]   VC fund, and you started investing in them when they first started, you could have invested
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:14.280]   in every single one of the funds and you would have crushed it because they have crushed
[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:20.840]   it. And the thing is, nobody very few people can allocate capital to Sequoia funds because
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:25.400]   they've done so well, there's just too much demand for their funds. So if you are still
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:30.320]   aggressive in your financial independence journey, you know, you're working a day job,
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:35.840]   you want to network more investing in private funds is very powerful, you can network as
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:40.040]   much as you want, or as little as you want. For me, I'm just to stand back, right? Who
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:46.120]   cares? But for you, if you're trying to build a business or do something that limited partnership
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:50.960]   club could be very valuable to you. All right, the seventh reason for investing in private
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:56.680]   funds, it forces you to keep on investing over several years during bull markets and
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:02.000]   bear markets. After committing a certain amount of capital to a private fund, not all of it
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.280]   is called at once. Instead, your commitment may be called over a one to three year period
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:11.800]   usually, these are capital calls, right? So for example, let's say you commit $100,000
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:18.280]   to a fund, you might have a capital call of 20% of the 100,000 or $20,000 when it closes
[00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:24.800]   or the first quarter after it closes, and then followed by 10% capital calls, you know,
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:29.080]   every quarter for the next eight quarters. So capital call schedule keeps you invested
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:33.800]   through good times and bad times. For me, I really like that because it forces me to
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:37.800]   invest no matter what. It's like I don't have to think about Oh, you know, the stock market's
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:43.960]   down 10% should I be allocating 10% of my cash, 20% 50% all that stuff takes a lot of
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:49.320]   energy. But if you have a capital call schedule, where you just have to follow it because you
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:55.200]   have agreed to be a limited partner. It's, it's very stress free, just okay, I'm going
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:11:00.080]   to send that money in, they are going to invest the money how I see fit. I've already done
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:06.360]   the due diligence on the managers and their track record. It's very freeing. This is something
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:09.640]   I can't really explain. But it's just very freeing when you let someone else manage your
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:13.920]   money that you trust. All right, I know I said there were seven reasons to invest in
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:18.520]   private funds. But here's an eighth reason for good measure. Investing in private funds
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:24.520]   forces you to hold for the long term. They generally have five to 10 year life cycles
[00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:29.400]   before your capital is returned to you. Therefore, you're forced to invest for this period of
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:35.200]   time, the longer the investment time horizon, the greater your chance of making more money.
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:39.120]   If you're investing in public securities with zero cost to liquidate, it's much easier to
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:43.680]   panic sell. I'm sure plenty of people did in March 2020. I'm sure plenty of people did
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:51.760]   in 2018 2019 is just human nature. Public investments can be a tantalizing source of
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:55.760]   capital every time there's a downturn or some type of emergency. Whereas when you invest
[00:11:55.760 --> 00:12:01.160]   in a private fund, you are committed for the duration of that fund. You can access the
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:06.920]   capital without getting a lot of backlash, a lot of stink eye, you're committed, they're
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:12.040]   committed. Now, obviously, there are negatives to investing in a private fund. Biggest one
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:17.960]   are the high fees, the fees are so high compared to index fund. I mean, it's like 10 x 20 x
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:23.440]   higher. But the hope is you're going to have higher returns. But the reality is oftentimes
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:28.800]   these private funds don't return as much as a respective index fund. So you have a double
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:33.520]   whammy there. Another negative is tax time come tax time, you've got to keep track of
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:38.400]   all your K ones for these private funds. If you do it yourself, it's a lot of work. If
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:43.400]   you pay an accountant do it, every single K one filing costs money. The final negative
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:50.040]   is a lack of liquidity. Yes, you can stop meeting the capital calls. Nobody can force
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:55.040]   you to do anything, but you're going to be blackballed from the fund in any future funds.
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:59.280]   And then you might work word might get around that says, you know what, you don't commit
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:03.640]   to what you sign, and you're not going to be invited to future funds. So if you want
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:07.760]   to invest in a private fund, make sure you allocate only the capital you're willing not
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:15.240]   to touch for the duration of the fund. Personally, I love long holding periods. Every time capital
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:20.680]   comes in, you know, it feels good. But if you have an investor mentality in a high inflation
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:25.520]   environment, you kind of start stressing you start wondering how am I going to reinvest
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:30.520]   this capital so it doesn't lose too much purchasing power from inflation. And then you start thinking,
[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:35.320]   well, if I invest in this stock, or this bond, or this asset, it's going to do well, it's
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:39.440]   not going to do well. And with private funds, you've already just decided, okay, this is
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:43.960]   where you want to allocate your capital with some smart, hopefully people, and they're
[00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:48.120]   going to do the work for you. So you don't have to stress about it as much. Currently,
[00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:53.720]   I invest about 10 to 15% of my capital into private funds. And I plan to continue going
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:59.200]   forward, I might increase it to try to manage volatility and risk. For those of you wondering
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:04.600]   how to gain access and invest in private funds. Well, there's really no easy way to do it.
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:08.040]   There's no like centralized website. And you know what there probably is, but I don't know
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:14.240]   of one. Here's the strategy if you want to invest in a very promising private fund. One,
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:18.160]   you either need to have to have worked at the fund or work at the fund, know someone
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:24.480]   who works at the fund, get introduced, proactively reach out and see if there are any synergies
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:30.320]   you can provide, or come from one of the companies the fund has invested in. A lot of private
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:36.240]   funds have quote anchor investors from institutional funds, endowments and ultra high net worth
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:41.600]   individuals. Once the anchor investors are in the fund managers and anchor investors
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:46.960]   invite smaller investors. It's just how it goes. It just goes from top to the bottom.
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:53.520]   And so imagine if you're like a whale and you invest $10 million or $50 million into
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:58.440]   a billion dollar fund, but you have friends from high school or college who are interested
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:04.520]   in investing 50,000, 100,000, 200,000. They can probably get in because you are the anchor
[00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:10.020]   investor. So again, it's a lot to do with who you know, a lot of these private funds
[00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:15.760]   have what they call friends and family round. So that's where the opportunity for most of
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:21.400]   us lie. And here's the thing, the jobs act that was passed in 2012 has helped democratize
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:26.240]   access to private funds. You know, you've seen a plethora of real estate crowdfunding
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:33.200]   platforms, some like fundrise, for example, rise to over 210,000 investors managing over
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:40.000]   $2.5 billion under management. In the past, investors like you and I couldn't invest in
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.920]   high quality commercial real estate, unless we had millions and millions of dollars. And
[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:50.240]   now we can. And you also see other platforms where you can invest in art, in wine, in all
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:56.040]   sorts of things, thanks to the passage of the jobs act. Of course, then it's up to you
[00:15:56.040 --> 00:16:01.920]   to carefully do your research and vet these private funds. Because frankly, everything
[00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:07.680]   tends to sound great before you invest. And of course, not everything will make you money.
[00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:12.120]   So that's all folks. I hope you enjoyed my talk on private funds. If you enjoyed this
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:16.800]   podcast, I'd love a positive review and a subscription. Tell your friends. It's the
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:20.920]   way I get motivated to keep on recording and keep on writing. Thanks so much.
