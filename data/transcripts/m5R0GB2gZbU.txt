[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.200]   - Here is today's email question.
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.440]   Hello Pastor John, my name is Eli, I'm 21,
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.000]   and I'm from Philly.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.120]   I have a question concerning God's sovereignty.
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.720]   In the Bible, it seems like a couple of times
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.000]   we read where God makes someone sin
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.120]   for the benefit of his chosen people.
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.720]   For example, in Exodus 7, verses one to five,
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.520]   where we see God telling Moses and Aaron,
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.180]   I will harden Pharaoh's heart,
[00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.500]   and though I multiply my signs and wonders
[00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.760]   in the land of Egypt, Pharaoh will not listen to you.
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.520]   And Romans 9, 18, it is affirmed by saying,
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.280]   so then he has mercy on whomever he wills,
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.040]   and he hardens whomever he wills.
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.520]   I've spoken to many Christian brothers,
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.880]   even ones who are far older than I am,
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.460]   who seem to disagree with me time and time again
[00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.420]   that God can in fact make someone sin,
[00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.800]   judge them for it, and still be a righteous, good God.
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.280]   What I get from those conversations
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.220]   is that they are ultimately questioning God
[00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.560]   just as Job did, that it's not about
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.120]   whether God can do it or not,
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.320]   it's whether they, created humans,
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.680]   feel like it's right or not right for God,
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.120]   our Creator, to do such things with us.
[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.400]   So can God in fact make someone sin,
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.100]   judge them for it, and still be righteous,
[00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.900]   just, and a good God?
[00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:21.280]   - The words that we use to describe God's causality,
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.760]   his causing in relation to evil
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.600]   make a really big difference in how people hear
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.040]   and respond to what the Bible teaches.
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.540]   Words don't make the final difference, but they do matter.
[00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.620]   Other things can hinder people from agreeing
[00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.600]   with what the Bible teaches besides just words,
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.360]   but words matter.
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.360]   And the reason they matter is that they carry associations
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.760]   and connotations which may be different
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.320]   from person to person, so we need to try
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.640]   to use words that carry as much truth
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.920]   of the Bible as possible and minimize
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.420]   the false connotations and associations
[00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.420]   that may rise in people's minds when they hear the word.
[00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.640]   Now that's an impossible task, ultimately.
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.880]   You can't make people hear what you intend
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.440]   if they have all kinds of associations
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.720]   with the necessary words that you don't intend.
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.200]   You can't make it happen, but we should at least try,
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.440]   which is why we're so dependent on the Holy Spirit
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.960]   and the communication of biblical truth,
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.280]   one of the reasons why.
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.400]   Now, when I say all that, I'm thinking about the phrase,
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.760]   can God in fact make someone sin?
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.700]   The word make probably, for many people,
[00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.980]   carries the connotation, force someone
[00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.980]   to act against His will, or turn someone into a robot
[00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:05.220]   so that it is not really they who are sinning, but God.
[00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.660]   Now, both of those associations or connotations
[00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.380]   to the word make sin are false.
[00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.460]   So if I say God makes someone sin
[00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.620]   and that, those connotations is what they hear,
[00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.500]   they have to reject what I say.
[00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.660]   They have to.
[00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.420]   They'd be right to, if that's what they think I mean.
[00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.300]   Their rejection would mean God does not force anyone
[00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.820]   to sin against His will, and they'd be right.
[00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.300]   Or it would mean God does not turn anyone into a robot
[00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.540]   so that their sinning is not theirs, but God's,
[00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.640]   and they'd be right.
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.640]   So we need to find words that express the truth
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.740]   that Eli is seeing.
[00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.140]   He's really seeing in the Bible,
[00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.380]   and avoid, if we can, words that carry
[00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.660]   those false connotations.
[00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.860]   Maybe we can't, maybe we can.
[00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.340]   We should at least try.
[00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.260]   If people wanna put meaning on our words
[00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.580]   or in our mouths that we don't intend, we can't stop them,
[00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.020]   but we can at least try to be as clear as possible.
[00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.860]   So what if I said, instead of make people sin,
[00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.220]   what if I said, God governs all things in this world,
[00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.180]   and even sin is not outside His control?
[00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.740]   Would it get the same response?
[00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.340]   Maybe, maybe not.
[00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.820]   Or what if I said, God rules the world
[00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.220]   and everything that happens in it?
[00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:39.220]   Or what if I said, God foresees all that will come,
[00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.940]   and He can stop anything He pleases from happening,
[00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.220]   or He can permit it to happen,
[00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.340]   and if He stops it or permits it,
[00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.620]   He thus controls whether it happens?
[00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.220]   What if I talked like that?
[00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.140]   I think I am saying what Eli wants to say,
[00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:04.980]   and I think if that's what he wants to say, he's right.
[00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.740]   And clearly, in all of this,
[00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.620]   human accountability in the Bible is affirmed and sustained,
[00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.620]   and therefore God is righteous to judge all sin,
[00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.380]   either in Christ or in hell.
[00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.380]   Now, what do I base that on?
[00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.700]   So let me just give a few texts here.
[00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.540]   Number one, Ephesians 1:11.
[00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.660]   The Bible teaches that, well, I'll just read it.
[00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.540]   In Him, we have obtained an inheritance,
[00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.380]   having been predestined according to the purpose
[00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.100]   of Him who works all things
[00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.220]   according to the counsel of His will.
[00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.900]   So God works all things
[00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.580]   according to the counsel of His will.
[00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.980]   Number two, the Bible teaches that Satan
[00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.300]   is the cause of many sins,
[00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.620]   but Satan is not ultimately out of God's control.
[00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:00.340]   He operates only by permission from God.
[00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.100]   Therefore, God can always restrain Satan,
[00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.060]   put limits on Satan to any degree He pleases,
[00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.060]   and therefore God governs what Satan does.
[00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.180]   See Job, see Peter's denials.
[00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:17.540]   Third, when Joseph's brothers in the Old Testament
[00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:19.860]   sold him into slavery, they sinned.
[00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:24.860]   Both Genesis and Psalms teach that this was planned
[00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.420]   and ordained and brought about by God.
[00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:31.980]   Psalm 105, God had sent a man ahead of them,
[00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.740]   Joseph, who was sold as a slave.
[00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.500]   God sent him.
[00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:40.700]   That was what happened when he was sold as a slave.
[00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.980]   And Joseph himself describes the event
[00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:45.940]   in Genesis 50, verse 20,
[00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:50.220]   when he says, "As for you, you brothers,
[00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:53.860]   you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good."
[00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.660]   It doesn't say God used it for good.
[00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.260]   They had a meaning, it was an evil meaning.
[00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.100]   God had a meaning, it was a good meaning.
[00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.620]   And He brought about salvation
[00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:06.340]   for the people of God and the redemption
[00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:08.580]   that would one day come through the seed.
[00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:13.300]   So yes, God was in, on, controlling, governing,
[00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:15.780]   bringing about what happened there.
[00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:19.020]   And number four, when they were in Egypt,
[00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:22.420]   the psalmist says, this is perhaps the most blatant
[00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:25.100]   statement of all of what Eli's saying,
[00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:27.140]   Psalm 105, verse 25,
[00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:31.020]   God turned their hearts to hate the people,
[00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:33.620]   to deal craftily with his servants.
[00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.900]   This is a strong statement of God's sovereignty,
[00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:41.900]   and we should receive it and assume that God can do that
[00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:47.180]   without removing the real willing and real responsibility
[00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:52.060]   of the Egyptians in sinning against Israel.
[00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:54.700]   And one more, and this is the most important
[00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:56.940]   because it relates to the gospel.
[00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:00.180]   I don't think it's possible consistently
[00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:03.380]   to believe in the gospel if you reject
[00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:07.140]   that God can bring about His will
[00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:11.620]   by the sins of people that He governs.
[00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:15.540]   Because it says in Acts 4, 27,
[00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:18.500]   truly in this city, they were gathered together
[00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.340]   against your holy servant, Jesus,
[00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:23.220]   whom you anointed, both Herod, Pontius Pilate,
[00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:25.860]   along with Gentiles and the peoples of Israel,
[00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:30.300]   to do whatever your hand and your plan
[00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:32.500]   had predestined to take place.
[00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:35.500]   So Herod's mockery and purple cloak,
[00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:40.500]   Pilate's expedient accession to the will of the mob,
[00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:45.660]   Israel's plotting and envy and cry to crucify Him,
[00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:49.540]   crucify Him, and the soldiers' crown of thorns,
[00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:52.180]   their scoffing and their gambling,
[00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:56.420]   all of that was sin, and all of it was planned
[00:08:56.420 --> 00:09:01.420]   and ruled, ordained, scripted ahead of time by God.
[00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:06.100]   Whatever your hand and your plan had predestined
[00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:09.180]   to take place took place at Calvary.
[00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:14.100]   So I agree with what Eli means.
[00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:19.100]   God governs all sins, and people are responsible
[00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:21.740]   for those sins that they commit.
[00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:24.260]   It is they who will them and commit them,
[00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:28.100]   and God is righteous to judge them.
[00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:33.100]   And at the heart of this truth is the gospel of Jesus,
[00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:36.300]   bearing the sins of all who trust Him,
[00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:41.180]   and there would be no glorious gospel of God
[00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:45.380]   without this glorious sovereignty of God.
[00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:46.460]   - Pastor John, thank you.
[00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:48.220]   These are hard truths to grasp,
[00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:50.380]   and if you need more time and more details,
[00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:53.060]   be sure to see the book that John Pepper wrote
[00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:54.140]   on this very theme.
[00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:56.980]   The book is titled Spectacular Sins,
[00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:58.980]   and it's a book you can download for free online
[00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:02.500]   at desiringgod.org/books.
[00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:04.780]   Pastor John and I return tomorrow to close out the week.
[00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:05.700]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:08.300]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John Podcast.
[00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:10.880]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.460]   (upbeat music)
