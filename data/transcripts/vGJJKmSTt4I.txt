[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.960]   Last time in episode 233, you gave us a brief summary of events during your three-week trip
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.680]   to Ethiopia and the UAE.
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.160]   And knowing you, Pastor John, I presume you returned with some fresh theological thoughts
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.640]   simmering in your mind as well.
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.720]   So is there anything theologically you want to share with us from your trip?
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.640]   One of the things that keeps simmering, Tony, since I got back, and it probably is the most
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.080]   significant theological, missiological insight that I got in the trip, which was like an
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.800]   education for me, came out of a lecture I was giving on the sovereignty of God.
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.400]   And when I was done, I mean, I really stressed God's absolute sovereignty over all things.
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.560]   He controls all things for the good of His people and the glory of His name.
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:54.720]   And a question raised his hand, and he said, "Now, that sounds a lot like the Muslim view
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.840]   of God's sovereignty."
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:04.040]   And you hear here in the UAE, "If God wills, if God wills, if God wills," all the time.
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:12.560]   And in the Muslim view, God can do anything He wants, and they actually use the name "Capricious"
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:13.560]   for God.
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:23.040]   I was standing in the second biggest mosque in the world in front of the biggest wall
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.240]   of the 100 names of God under the biggest chandelier of its kind, standing on the biggest
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.560]   hand-woven carpet.
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.760]   This is all the way they describe it when you're there.
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.080]   And one of those names at the top, my friend Mike was there explaining them to me.
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.320]   He's just pointing out name after name written in Arabic, and he said, "That one up there
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.120]   is usually translated 'Capricious,' which means God is free.
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.600]   He can do anything He wants."
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.680]   Now here's what I realized as I tried to think through, what's the difference between my
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:59.880]   view of the biblical sovereignty of God and the Muslim view of God as Capricious?
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:08.000]   Other names of God that they have on that wall are wise and just and kind and compassionate.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.520]   And I thought to myself, "You know, the name 'Capricious' virtually cancels out those,
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:22.440]   because if God can do anything He wants," meaning if you're standing before Him and
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.240]   He can just flick you off to hell or flick you off to heaven capriciously, without reference
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.560]   to His kindness, without reference to His justice, without reference to His compassion,
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.800]   then what good are those names?
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.680]   They're meaningless if there's this overarching sense of capriciousness.
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:47.680]   And I think that really on the street governs a lot of what Muslims feel.
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:54.720]   They know that God is like that, and therefore, "Okay, sara, sara, in the end of the day I'll
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.520]   do the best I can with my five acts of devotion, but He can do with me whatever He wants at
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.800]   the end of the day, and I may go to heaven, I may go to hell."
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.480]   So here's the new insight.
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:16.460]   At the center of our religion, at the center of Christianity, is Romans 3, 25, which goes
[00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:25.040]   like this, "God put Christ forward as a propitiation by His blood to be received by faith."
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:31.640]   This was to show God's righteousness or justice, because in His divine forbearance He had passed
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.120]   over former sins.
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.600]   Now right there is the center of our faith.
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:44.520]   God sent Christ, and He sent Him to die in order to be a propitiation, that is, to remove
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.740]   His own wrath.
[00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:52.880]   God loved us by removing His own wrath from us by having Jesus in His blood absorb the
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.460]   wrath which was owing to our sin.
[00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:59.300]   There's the heart of the Christian gospel.
[00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:06.180]   And He says the reason He did it was to show His justice or His righteousness.
[00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.080]   Why did He need to show His justice and righteousness?
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:16.200]   It says, end of verse 25, "Because in His divine forbearance He had passed over former
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.200]   sins."
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.480]   Now think that through and what it means for God's sovereignty.
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:26.520]   God had been passing over sins, so He had been forgiving Abraham and forgiving David,
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.320]   his adultery and his murder of Uriah.
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.400]   He'd just been passing over these sins.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.960]   Now what did that look like?
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:39.680]   Well Paul said it looked like He was unjust, because it looked like He was accepting the
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.280]   belittling of His glory, which is what sin is.
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.400]   All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:54.520]   So here is God acting as if the belittling and the dishonoring of His glory didn't matter.
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.360]   And that's unjust of God.
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.920]   That's unrighteous of Him to treat the infinitely valuable glory of God as though it were not
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:02.920]   valuable.
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:09.800]   And therefore God, in order to vindicate His righteousness and demonstrate His just
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:16.120]   allegiance to the value of His glory, sends His Son to fix that.
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:24.060]   Now that is something that in Islam would never be necessary, because God doesn't have
[00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.040]   to do anything to fix anything.
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:37.720]   God is free to take a person like David, say, "I'll just let your murder of Uriah and your
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.360]   rape of Bathsheba, we'll just let it go.
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.480]   I'm free to do that."
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:47.800]   Well, what I realize now is that the sovereignty of God as the Bible presents it is that it
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.320]   is in the constellation of other attributes of God.
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:06:02.880]   His justice and His mercy and His grace and His wisdom, so that when God passes over a
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:11.200]   rape and a murder, something's got to give, something's got to be done in the universe,
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.360]   not just to say, "Well, God is capricious, He can do what He wants," but rather, "God
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:20.720]   is just and He is holy and He doesn't let sin be swept under the rug of the universe,
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.120]   and therefore what will He do?
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:27.600]   He will send His own Son into the world in order to demonstrate the righteousness of
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.600]   God."
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:35.320]   So, the upshot is that Christian views of God's sovereignty and Muslim views of God's
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:41.720]   sovereignty are profoundly different, because in the Christian view, His sovereignty is
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:50.680]   being guided and shaped by the other attributes from within God.
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:57.240]   Muslims tend to feel like if God has to yield to some sense of justice or some sense of
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:02.400]   righteousness or mercy or compassion, then He's limited.
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:07.960]   But the answer is He's not limited, because those attributes are not outside of Him, govern
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.640]   Him like controllers from another source.
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:11.800]   They are inside of Him.
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:12.800]   They're who He is.
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:20.520]   And so it was a great illumination to me that right at the center of our faith is an act
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:30.280]   of God that shows how His sovereignty coheres with His righteousness, and I think this is
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:39.240]   one of the reasons why Muslims find the gospel, the substitutionary death of Christ, so difficult
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.240]   to understand.
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:44.240]   It's not just that in their tradition Christ didn't die and didn't rise from the dead.
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:49.720]   I think all of that is quite secondary to the fact that given their view of God, such
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:57.480]   a thing is preposterous, that God, being as free as He is, would never need to send His
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:02.240]   Son into the world to die in order to vindicate His righteousness.
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.240]   Very interesting, and much in here to think about.
