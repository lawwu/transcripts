[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.060]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.060]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:14.940]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.400]   Today, my guest is Dr. Alyssa Epple.
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.300]   Dr. Epple is a professor of psychiatry
[00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.540]   and behavioral sciences
[00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.180]   at the University of California, San Francisco.
[00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.940]   She is also the director of the Center on Aging,
[00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.720]   Metabolism, and Emotions.
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.920]   Dr. Epple's laboratory focuses on stress
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.760]   and the many impacts that it has on our brain and body,
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.880]   both negative and positive.
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.380]   For instance, her laboratory has shown
[00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.880]   that particular forms of stress change our telomeres,
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.800]   which are a component of the genetic machinery of our cells
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.080]   that impacts how quickly our cells and therefore we age.
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.120]   We also discuss exciting work from Dr. Epple's laboratory,
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.840]   exploring how stress impacts our behavioral choices,
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.180]   in particular, which foods we elect to eat
[00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.800]   and how we experience those foods.
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.080]   Today, you'll learn how stress
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.380]   and your interpretation of your stress
[00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.660]   impacts the different aspects of your biology and psychology.
[00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.620]   You'll also learn about several important stress
[00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.380]   interventions that Dr. Epple's laboratory has explored,
[00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.440]   including meditation and breath work
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.920]   can profoundly influence the way
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.900]   that stress impacts your brain and body,
[00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.860]   both for better or for worse.
[00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.640]   She's also explored how specific dietary interventions,
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.160]   such as omega-3 fatty acid intake,
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.000]   impacts stress and our response to stress.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.080]   And a key and important feature, I believe,
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.600]   of Dr. Epple's work is how stress and stress interventions
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.460]   vary in their effectiveness,
[00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.000]   depending on whether or not the subjects in her experiments
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.680]   are male versus female and their social status.
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.920]   By the end of today's episode,
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.920]   I assure you, you will have a much more thorough
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.240]   understanding of what stress is
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.960]   and how it changes our biology and psychology,
[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.160]   as well as the specific stress interventions
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.360]   that are going to be most optimal for you
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.760]   in reducing the negative effects of stress
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.200]   on the aging process and on negative behavioral choices,
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.100]   and also how to leverage stress
[00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.120]   in order to maximize the positive effects
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.520]   that stress can have on cellular metabolism,
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.240]   mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.960]   To learn more about the work from Dr. Epple's laboratory,
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.120]   as well as to learn more about her books,
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.000]   entitled "The Telomere Effect,"
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   and now more recently, "The Stress Prescription,"
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.720]   you can find links to those in the show note captions.
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.400]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.900]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.020]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.580]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.380]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.440]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.180]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.160]   Our first sponsor is Thesus.
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.180]   Thesus makes custom nootropics.
[00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.320]   And frankly, I'm not a fan of the word nootropics
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.560]   because it translates to smart drugs.
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.660]   And as a neurobiologist, I can tell you
[00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.600]   that our brain has neural circuits and chemicals
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.200]   that underlie, for instance, our ability to focus
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.800]   or to task switch or to be creative.
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.080]   There is no one specific circuit or category of chemicals
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.900]   in the brain that allow us to be smart.
[00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.800]   Thesus understands this and has developed nootropics
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.460]   that are customized to different types of mental operations.
[00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.440]   What do I mean by that?
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.080]   Well, they have formulas that can put your brain
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.880]   into a state of increased clarity or focus or creativity,
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.000]   or that can give you more overall energy
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.480]   for things like physical exercise.
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.600]   I often take the Thesus clarity formula
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.040]   prior to long bouts of cognitive work,
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.720]   and I'll use their energy formula
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.380]   prior to doing any kind of really intense physical exercise.
[00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.220]   If you'd like to try
[00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.080]   your own personalized nootropic starter kit,
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.200]   go online to takethesis.com/huberman.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.920]   You'll take a brief three-minute quiz,
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.180]   and Thesus will send you four different formulas
[00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.860]   to try in your first month.
[00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.320]   Again, that's takethesis.com/huberman.
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.120]   And if you use the code Huberman at checkout,
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.220]   you'll get 10% off your order.
[00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.080]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.840]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.800]   with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.720]   I've talked many times before on this podcast
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.460]   and on other podcasts about the critical relationship
[00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.760]   between sleep and body temperature.
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.880]   Put simply, in order to fall asleep
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.140]   and stay asleep deeply throughout the night,
[00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.860]   your body needs to drop by about one to three degrees
[00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.040]   in its core body temperature.
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.120]   And conversely, waking up involves one to three degree
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.400]   increases in your core body temperature.
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.360]   So it's very important that you control the temperature
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.460]   of your sleeping environment,
[00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:18.720]   which also includes the temperature of your mattress.
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.320]   That's what Eight Sleep mattress covers allow you to do.
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.360]   So for instance, I tend to run hot during the night,
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.900]   so I have my mattress set to be pretty cool
[00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:26.880]   at the beginning of the night,
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.400]   and then to get progressively cooler
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.740]   and then warm toward morning when I want to wake up.
[00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.000]   And in doing this, it's allowed me
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.520]   to really optimize my sleep.
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.920]   And I sleep much more deeply
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.840]   and I get far more rapid eye movement sleep
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.180]   than I ever did prior to using Eight Sleep.
[00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.440]   If you'd like to try Eight Sleep,
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.820]   you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman
[00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.820]   to save $150 off their pod three cover.
[00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.580]   Eight Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK,
[00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.760]   select countries in the EU, and Australia.
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.480]   Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman.
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.600]   Today's episode is also brought to us by HVMN Ketone IQ.
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.440]   Ketone IQ is a supplement that increases blood ketones.
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.360]   I think most people out there
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.200]   have heard of the ketogenic diet.
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.440]   However, most people out there, including myself,
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.340]   do not follow a ketogenic diet.
[00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.220]   Despite not following a ketogenic diet,
[00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.520]   I make it a point to increase my blood ketones
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.400]   through the use of Ketone IQ.
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.900]   The reason for that is that ketones
[00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.480]   are one of the brain's preferred sources of fuel.
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.560]   I find that by taking Ketone IQ,
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.080]   I have elevated levels of focus
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.920]   for several hours afterwards.
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.080]   It also allows me to do physical training
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.980]   or mental work fasted.
[00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:29.200]   And in addition to that,
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.960]   I focus much better when I take Ketone IQ
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.520]   as opposed to fasted alone.
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:34.900]   So many people like me find that
[00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.780]   whether or not they follow a ketogenic diet
[00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.380]   or a more typical diet,
[00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:39.920]   supplementing with Ketone IQ
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.000]   and thereby increasing their blood ketones
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.240]   allows them to do more focused mental work
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.380]   and physical work, even when fasted or when a bit hungry.
[00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:48.860]   So if you'd like to try Ketone IQ,
[00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.920]   go to hvmn.com and use the code Huberman
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.600]   to get 20% off your order.
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.680]   Again, that's hvmn.com and use the code Huberman
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:57.960]   to get 20% off.
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.100]   The Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.940]   is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.
[00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:02.260]   To find the supplements we discuss
[00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:03.480]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.120]   you can go to Live Momentus, spelled O-U-S,
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.680]   livemomentus.com/huberman.
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.060]   And I should just mention that the library
[00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.240]   of those supplements is constantly expanding.
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.400]   Again, that's livemomentus.com/huberman.
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.440]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Alyssa Epple.
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.880]   Dr. Epple, welcome.
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:20.940]   - Thank you.
[00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.180]   - So great to have you here.
[00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:23.940]   We have colleagues in common
[00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:27.760]   and topics of interest related to our laboratories in common.
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.480]   So I've got a lot of questions today.
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:33.040]   I'd love to just kick off by you explaining a little bit
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.920]   about the different forms of stress.
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.600]   You know, we hear stress, stress is bad, stress can kill us.
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.860]   No one likes to feel stressed, et cetera.
[00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.240]   But as you and I both know, that's not the entire picture.
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.540]   So I'd love for you to just educate us a bit
[00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:48.640]   on what stress is and what it isn't,
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.500]   where it can be problematic
[00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.620]   and where perhaps it can even be beneficial.
[00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:56.060]   - So as a stress scientist,
[00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:00.700]   it is a word I use a lot, but it has to be broken down
[00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:04.340]   because it has so many different kind of dimensions
[00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:05.180]   and meanings.
[00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:06.440]   So there's good and bad stress.
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.060]   There's acute and chronic stress.
[00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.140]   And, you know, technically it just means
[00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:14.560]   anytime we feel overwhelmed that we feel like
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.980]   the demands are too much for our resources.
[00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:20.640]   So that's kind of a very technical way to put it.
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:25.480]   But really so much of life is about meeting challenges
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:28.380]   and we're never going to get rid of
[00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:30.520]   different stressful situations in life.
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.500]   If anything, they are increasing.
[00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:36.820]   And so it really comes down to not the stressors
[00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:40.580]   or what's happens to us, but really how we respond,
[00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:42.100]   the stress response.
[00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.920]   So that's a distinction that we're still trying to get
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:48.060]   the field to talk about stress in a more specific way
[00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:49.180]   so that we can think about,
[00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:51.960]   well, what situations are in your life?
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.580]   They might be difficult, ongoing situations
[00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:56.900]   like caregiving or work stress,
[00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:01.900]   or worrying about health, your own or someone's.
[00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:06.460]   And then there's, how are you coping with it?
[00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:08.260]   So when something happens,
[00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.900]   we mount a stress response and we recover.
[00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:13.580]   And that's beautiful, no harm done.
[00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:14.420]   We need that.
[00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:16.100]   And that's why we're here still alive
[00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:17.860]   is that survival response.
[00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.980]   It's a problem these days of just,
[00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:22.500]   we keep it alive in our head.
[00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:23.780]   We keep it alive with our thoughts.
[00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:27.240]   Our thoughts are the most common form of stress.
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:30.220]   - Even though I expected that we would get into tools
[00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:32.200]   to combat stress a little bit later,
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.380]   since you have now told us that our thoughts
[00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:39.640]   are the biggest sort of propagator of internal stress,
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:43.660]   what to your knowledge is the best way
[00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:48.660]   or what are the best ways for us to manage overthinking
[00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:50.860]   and ruminating on stressful topics?
[00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:53.460]   Because I certainly experienced stress.
[00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:56.900]   And when I do, I have tools related to breath work,
[00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:00.900]   running, exercise, sleep, non-sleep, deep rest.
[00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.060]   I'm a huge fan of all these sorts of things.
[00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:05.360]   But when we succumb to stress
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:08.500]   and the thinking patterns take over
[00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:10.920]   where the gears are turning and they won't stop turning,
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.980]   what does the science tell us about ways
[00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:15.100]   to manage those thoughts?
[00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:17.520]   Should we work with them in the sense
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.940]   that we try and rationalize
[00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:23.940]   or understand the basis of the stress
[00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:26.540]   or should we try and divert our thinking away
[00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:28.660]   or is there some other tool that I'm unaware of?
[00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:30.100]   - Yes, yes, both and.
[00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:35.900]   So I like to bin it in three categories.
[00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:39.820]   So one is we, well, I'll just say, first of all,
[00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:43.760]   we have to have some awareness of how our mind works
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:47.380]   or we're just like a subject
[00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:49.340]   to thinking our thoughts are real,
[00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:51.900]   thinking that it's helpful to keep ruminating
[00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:54.480]   and problem solving because that's our tendency
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:58.140]   is to go toward whatever we think there's threat or risk
[00:09:58.140 --> 00:09:59.600]   and to problem solve that.
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.200]   You could just be stuck there all day
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:04.160]   in this kind of threat mode or red mind state.
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.600]   And that's just a shame.
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:10.600]   We don't need to turn on that stress response all the time,
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.940]   but that's where we are as a society.
[00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:16.420]   So that's why I wrote the stress rescription.
[00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:20.800]   Take any survey, even pre-pandemic and people feel,
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:24.880]   the majority of people feel an overwhelming amount of stress.
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:29.880]   So even this past year, 46% of adults report
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:32.500]   feeling overwhelmed by stress.
[00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:33.740]   And then you break it down and you're like,
[00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:36.060]   ooh, this is really bad for young adults
[00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:38.500]   and women and people of color.
[00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:42.720]   So we have these groups that are targeted for marginalization
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:46.740]   that are feeling an extremely high amount of stress
[00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:48.340]   in most of those subgroups.
[00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:49.180]   So bottom, yeah.
[00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:51.800]   - Wouldn't you argue that most everyone
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.020]   is feeling more stressed now?
[00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:55.420]   Or is it just, or what do the data say?
[00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:59.560]   - Yeah, so I think that we're,
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:05.100]   we come with different levels of awareness of our stress.
[00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:08.340]   And so when I find someone who really doesn't feel
[00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:12.460]   a lot of stress, sometimes I can see right through that
[00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:14.060]   and they're just not aware.
[00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:15.940]   And sometimes it really is true.
[00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:17.700]   They're often in a different stage of life
[00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:20.300]   and they control their environment a lot.
[00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:21.760]   And they've been through a lot.
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:25.460]   I mean, one of the big patterns
[00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:28.780]   in the population levels of stress
[00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:33.600]   is that the older people are less stressed, period.
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:37.020]   If you're over 65, you have been through so much,
[00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:39.940]   solved so much, you just have a better perspective
[00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:41.460]   on life and on stressors.
[00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:44.620]   And then our adults, our young adults have like four times
[00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:46.940]   the level of stress as our older adults.
[00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:49.980]   So we do, we don't have to wait till we get older,
[00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:52.620]   but there certainly is true wisdom and resilience
[00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:54.740]   that comes with age for many people.
[00:11:54.740 --> 00:12:00.380]   Often we're so used to feeling daily stress
[00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:04.260]   from our urban and modern life that we don't notice it.
[00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:05.100]   We're just used to it.
[00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:06.220]   And so we're going through the day
[00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:09.260]   with kind of like clenched hands and just, you know,
[00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.200]   for listeners, just even just taking a check in now
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:16.700]   and noticing how you might be holding stress in your body.
[00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:18.100]   That's a huge clue.
[00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:21.160]   It's a huge place where we accumulate tension.
[00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.300]   So we might not be aware that we're stressed,
[00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:24.780]   but we're clenching our hands.
[00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:29.260]   And in fact, my taxi driver who drove me here
[00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:35.580]   let me know that he's exactly that point
[00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:39.460]   that he doesn't realize he's stressed until he realizes
[00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:42.020]   that he's tensing his shoulders and his fists.
[00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:44.780]   And so great signal, you know, doing a check-in
[00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:47.500]   to like notice where in our body we're holding stress
[00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.680]   is step one to releasing it.
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:53.380]   - So going back to this notion of overthinking,
[00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:56.620]   what are the tools that are most efficient
[00:12:56.620 --> 00:13:00.360]   for dealing with overthinking or ruminating
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:04.820]   when people just can't seem to let go of the thing
[00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:07.860]   that's the stress or thinking about not the stress
[00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:10.580]   in their body, but the thing that caused the stress,
[00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:13.540]   the difficult conversation, the thing that irked them
[00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:15.500]   on social media or in their personal life
[00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:18.620]   or professional life or simply out in the world?
[00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:22.380]   - So I wish I had one answer,
[00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:25.140]   but I'm gonna say lots of strategies tackle that.
[00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:28.660]   And so in those three bins, one are top-down strategies
[00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:31.540]   of awareness and things that we can say to ourselves
[00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:36.540]   since our beliefs and mindsets can really help us
[00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:38.900]   release stress, view stress more positively.
[00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:42.940]   The second bucket is not that the mind changes the body,
[00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:44.120]   but the body changes the mind.
[00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:45.540]   And those are the set of strategies
[00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:47.340]   that you tend to use the most, right?
[00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:50.300]   Where we're working stress out of the body,
[00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:52.740]   we're metabolizing it, we're burning it up
[00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:56.880]   and we get relief, changes our amygdala activity
[00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:59.800]   and moves us to more an experiential state
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:02.380]   where we're more in our somatosensory cortex.
[00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:05.900]   And then the third bucket is change the scene,
[00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:09.700]   just getting away from all the stress triggers
[00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:14.700]   that we have in our office or in the city
[00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:19.480]   and being in an environment that we find calming.
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.360]   It might even just be a corner of the house,
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.400]   but implanting what I call safety signals,
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:27.040]   we're just these animals that are conditioned to signals,
[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.640]   whether we're aware of it or not.
[00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:32.480]   So having things like comforting pets,
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:36.400]   pictures, smells, music, why not?
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:38.960]   We need those, they help, they add up.
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:42.200]   - I like the idea of having a small physical space,
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:44.280]   or I suppose it could be a large physical space,
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:46.720]   but for most people who don't have the resources,
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:49.380]   some small predesignated physical space
[00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:54.380]   that represents a safe zone and creating,
[00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:58.580]   or I should say populating that safe zone with things,
[00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:02.080]   as you said, as a visual neuroscientist originally,
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:04.060]   I guess now I study stress,
[00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:06.380]   but as a visual neuroscientist,
[00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:09.740]   we know that photographs are extremely powerful cues
[00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:10.860]   for the memory system,
[00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:13.680]   especially actual physical photographs.
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:17.740]   And I believe there's some work on this
[00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:20.340]   that if people keep a photograph of something
[00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:22.260]   that draws positive memories,
[00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.700]   that that photograph actually, they keep it with them,
[00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:26.580]   that it actually can be a positive cue
[00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:30.540]   for alleviating stress and just enhancing mood.
[00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:32.260]   This is probably done less so nowadays
[00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:33.900]   because everyone keeps things on their phones
[00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:35.580]   and it's just kind of a scroll through,
[00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:39.860]   but in any event, when we talk about stress,
[00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:43.420]   it's clear that there's short-term,
[00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:45.000]   medium-term, long-term stress.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.400]   You studied all these different forms of stress.
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:51.460]   If you would be so kind as to just give us an overview
[00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:54.140]   of the different forms of stress,
[00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:57.700]   how we can learn to recognize those,
[00:15:57.700 --> 00:15:59.700]   and then I'd love to transition from there
[00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:01.820]   into talking about some of the work
[00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:04.220]   that you've been doing on stress and stress-related eating
[00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:07.660]   and stress and how it relates to aging in particular.
[00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:09.200]   But before we do that,
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:11.500]   to make sure everyone's on the same page,
[00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:13.540]   if you could just pepper our minds
[00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:17.000]   with knowledge about stress in all its beautiful
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.660]   and not so beautiful forms.
[00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:24.620]   - So when we think about stress,
[00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:27.260]   we usually think feeling stress, reporting stress,
[00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:28.280]   and that's important.
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:30.880]   What our body is doing is also important
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:32.580]   and it's not always related to our mind.
[00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:35.540]   So measuring levels of the nervous system
[00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:38.100]   and how vigilant we are is another way
[00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:39.980]   that we can understand stress.
[00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:42.140]   And that's particularly important and interesting
[00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:44.900]   because that's how stress gets under the skin
[00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:47.300]   and we might not be aware, we might not report stress,
[00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:49.140]   but we're still holding tension
[00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:53.120]   and being much more sympathetically dominated,
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:57.900]   meaning that our body is vigilant and scanning for cues
[00:16:57.900 --> 00:16:59.180]   and we don't feel safe.
[00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:02.300]   And so we're mobilizing a lot more energy
[00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:04.360]   than we need to.
[00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:08.060]   And stress is so expensive to the body.
[00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:13.060]   The stress response uses a tremendous amount of energy, ATP,
[00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:16.080]   that's made by our mitochondria.
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:18.900]   And if we have that kind of vigilant stress response
[00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:21.020]   on all day, we're just gonna feel exhausted.
[00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:22.740]   And we all feel exhausted at this stage
[00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:24.980]   of the kind of long shadow of the pandemic.
[00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:26.300]   And it's really no mystery
[00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:29.340]   because we're not good at turning the stress response off.
[00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:31.800]   And that's what we wanna really focus on
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:34.580]   is understanding we need to mount a big stress response
[00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:37.820]   to cope with things when we need extra energy,
[00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:41.900]   but then we can actually let our body relax
[00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:43.220]   and we can turn it off.
[00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:44.900]   And that's where the rumination comes in.
[00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:48.740]   We wanna catch ourselves rehearsing and reliving stress
[00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:52.580]   or worrying about the next thing, saying right now, I'm safe.
[00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:55.500]   And there's the breathing strategies, I'm right with you,
[00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:59.740]   where those are the most direct and fast path
[00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:02.260]   to reducing stress in the body, period.
[00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:04.800]   - Yeah, our colleague, David Spiegel,
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:07.080]   our associate chair of psychiatry at Stanford
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:10.260]   and also a colleague of yours as well,
[00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:13.140]   has I think said it best,
[00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:14.880]   which is that breathing is unique
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:16.960]   among the functions of the brain
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:19.100]   'cause it really originates as a brain function
[00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:20.700]   and then extends of course to the body
[00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:21.980]   in that it represents a bridge
[00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:24.860]   between the conscious and the unconscious
[00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:27.620]   because at any given moment we're breathing.
[00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:30.060]   And of course, at any given moment,
[00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:31.860]   we can take control of our breathing.
[00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:34.500]   There are very few brain circuits
[00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:36.260]   that impact the body in that way.
[00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:39.200]   Like I can't suddenly just change my rate of digestion
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:42.340]   because I decide to, but we can do that with breathing.
[00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:45.500]   We will definitely get into some of the work
[00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.780]   that you've been doing on breath work in particular.
[00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:49.680]   I know you have a study that's actually explored
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:51.260]   the Wim Hof method quite directly.
[00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:53.900]   One of the few studies that I'm aware of that's done that.
[00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:56.100]   So we'll get to that a little bit later.
[00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:59.660]   So you describe stress as a way
[00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:02.300]   that the body and mind mobilize energy.
[00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:04.220]   - Yeah, and I didn't quite answer your question.
[00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:06.620]   So there's that acute stress response
[00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:11.120]   when everything, every hormone and cell in our body
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:13.220]   is having a stress response
[00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:18.220]   and that is allowing us to reorient, focus, problem solve.
[00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:22.900]   It's really beautiful how much we can increase our capacity
[00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:24.580]   to do things during stress.
[00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:28.740]   And then if it lasts minutes or hours,
[00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:30.460]   we eventually recover.
[00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:35.180]   And that is what happens all day
[00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:38.980]   in a small, to small extents with daily stressors.
[00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:40.760]   We don't necessarily get so threatened
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:42.640]   that we release a lot of cortisol,
[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:45.020]   but our nervous system is going up and down all day.
[00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:49.080]   Then there's kind of moderate stressful events
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:52.820]   that maybe take days or months to cope with.
[00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:56.420]   And what's important there is that noticing like right now,
[00:19:56.420 --> 00:20:00.900]   am I really coping acutely with something or can I restore?
[00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:03.100]   So that kind of daily restoration is very important.
[00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:06.300]   And then there are chronically stressful situations
[00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:07.740]   that go on for years.
[00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:09.340]   Many of us, not all of us,
[00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:11.220]   but many of us have those in our life.
[00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:13.340]   These are situations,
[00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:15.260]   I'll just use caregiving as an example,
[00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:17.780]   that we can't change.
[00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:20.080]   We can't change other people.
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:23.320]   We can't change certain situations or resources.
[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:28.320]   And we can be thinking about them,
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:30.320]   chronically problem solving,
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:33.320]   trying to wish things were different,
[00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:36.960]   or we can use acceptance, radical acceptance strategies
[00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:40.240]   and other strategies to live well with them.
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:42.680]   And so that's a really important strategy
[00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:47.680]   for people who feel like their life
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.840]   is going to be stressful forever
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:52.900]   because of X or Y, that's not true.
[00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:55.220]   You have a harder life, you're gonna do more coping,
[00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:58.620]   but you can actually be dealing
[00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:01.020]   with uncontrollable chronic stress
[00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:04.940]   in ways that it's not gonna take that toll on your body.
[00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:06.480]   I mean, I study chronic stress
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:07.620]   and how it accelerates cell aging.
[00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:08.620]   And I can tell you,
[00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:10.840]   there's so much variance between people.
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:11.820]   People are so different.
[00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:13.060]   So among caregivers,
[00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:16.620]   some of them look as biologically young or younger
[00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:17.900]   than our controls.
[00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:21.140]   People with no identifiable big tough situation
[00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:21.980]   in their life.
[00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:26.840]   - I love to hear about the lack of inevitability
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:28.760]   around aging and stress.
[00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:32.820]   I realized that there's a big landscape of discussion
[00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:34.480]   around aging and stress for us to cover,
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:37.000]   but since you brought it up,
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.900]   in one of your papers, there's a beautiful graph.
[00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:41.920]   And since a lot of people are listening, not watching,
[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:44.980]   and we don't use visual diagrams for that reason,
[00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:46.980]   I'll try and explain this as best I can.
[00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:51.920]   You distinguish between optimal aging,
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:54.420]   typical aging and accelerated aging.
[00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:56.660]   And I think everyone I can imagine
[00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:58.580]   would want optimal aging, right?
[00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:00.720]   Certainly not accelerated aging.
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:03.460]   And what's interesting about this graph in your paper
[00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:07.280]   is that while of course it appears that toxic stress,
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:10.740]   chronically unmitigated stress
[00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:15.220]   that makes us feel like we are at the world's mercy
[00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:19.080]   or the other people's mercy will accelerate aging.
[00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:21.800]   It turns out that underexposure to stress
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:25.080]   leads to more rapid aging than what you describe
[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:28.100]   as ideal amounts of stress.
[00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:33.100]   In other words, that no stress is not the answer,
[00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:35.400]   rather to have some stress is ideal
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:38.460]   if you want to have so-called optimal aging.
[00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:39.920]   Can you explain a little bit
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:42.580]   about the mechanisms behind that?
[00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:45.220]   Maybe this is a good opportunity also to tell us
[00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:46.600]   about your telomere work.
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:50.340]   So the questions are,
[00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:54.740]   how does one measure optimal versus accelerated aging?
[00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:57.760]   And why would it be that some stress is better
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:02.380]   than no stress when it comes to aging ideally?
[00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:07.580]   - So having no stress means we're not really living.
[00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:11.620]   Like we're not engaging in the gifts of life,
[00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:15.260]   which inevitably have some challenge and risk.
[00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:17.260]   And let me give you an example.
[00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:21.780]   One study took elderly people who were tired
[00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:26.660]   and society kind of labels them as you're kind of done
[00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:28.460]   with your meaningful work in life
[00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:33.460]   and you are pretty much not able to contribute to society.
[00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:36.660]   I mean, there's so many negative stereotypes
[00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:39.180]   that people then kind of embody and then live.
[00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:43.060]   And this program brought them to work in schools
[00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:46.460]   and tutor young at-risk students.
[00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:49.100]   And what happened to them is they went
[00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:52.340]   from feeling maybe safe and under-stressed
[00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:57.340]   to feeling challenged, but generative.
[00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:59.740]   They were feeling more purpose.
[00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:02.120]   They were feeling like they were growing
[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:06.100]   and they were feeling like their day had more meaning.
[00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:07.900]   They had more relationships.
[00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:11.820]   They had these caring relationships with the students.
[00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:15.340]   The students had all sorts of issues and troubles,
[00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:18.460]   drugs and maybe not having lunch, poverty.
[00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:20.680]   And so they felt the stress of that,
[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:23.220]   but they also saw how much they could help
[00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:25.220]   with their support and their tutoring.
[00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:29.860]   And in this study, they took images of the hippocampus
[00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:32.160]   and those who engaged in the program,
[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:34.820]   particularly the men, actually had growth
[00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:36.940]   of their hippocampus during this program.
[00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:40.620]   So at any stage in life, we can be growing
[00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:43.620]   and challenging ourselves even in our much later years
[00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:45.460]   and growing our brain.
[00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:47.260]   And you know more than anyone,
[00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:50.780]   what does that hippocampal growth mean for their wellbeing
[00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:53.020]   and their cognitive function?
[00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:55.060]   - Yeah, it's interesting that hippocampus, of course,
[00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:59.360]   a brain area involved in formation and recall of memories,
[00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:01.300]   mostly formation of memories.
[00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:03.300]   It's super interesting because it's so plastic.
[00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:06.780]   It's so amenable to the addition of new memories.
[00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:10.800]   I think the most striking study to me is the one,
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:13.420]   and I should point out that most of the data say
[00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:16.200]   that the addition of new neurons is not the main reason
[00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:19.620]   for improvements in memory, but it is one of them.
[00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:22.140]   But Rusty Gage down at the Salk Institute did a study
[00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:24.260]   in the, I think the early 2000s,
[00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:27.120]   where they took terminally ill people
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:29.420]   and these people agreed to have their bodies injected
[00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:32.780]   with a dye that would label new neurons.
[00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:35.460]   And then after they died, their brains were processed
[00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:38.860]   and they didn't die from the dye injection, by the way,
[00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:41.620]   folks that died from other causes, they were terminally ill.
[00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:44.820]   And what they discovered was that even in terminally ill
[00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:49.620]   or, and some of these people were quite old,
[00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:53.520]   those people were still generating new neurons,
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:55.980]   especially in the context of still trying to learn
[00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:57.600]   and acquire new information.
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:59.820]   So of course they're dead,
[00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:01.580]   so they can't apply that information after that.
[00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:02.820]   But of course, none of us can, right?
[00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:03.660]   None of the information that-
[00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:05.660]   - Yeah, but why not up to when you die, right?
[00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:06.500]   - Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:08.140]   - So one other example of this,
[00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:09.380]   my colleague Dave Almeida,
[00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:11.860]   he measures daily stressful events
[00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:13.700]   in huge national populations
[00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:17.420]   and a small percentage of people report no stressors.
[00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:19.360]   And so you wonder like, what's happening?
[00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:20.580]   Are they not engaging in life?
[00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:22.380]   Are they really not having stressors?
[00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:24.740]   It looks like they are,
[00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:26.620]   it's not just that they're not getting stressed by things,
[00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:29.320]   they're not really going out and doing much.
[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:32.860]   And what he found is that their level of kind of memory
[00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:35.540]   and cognition, their cognitive health
[00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:37.680]   was significantly lower.
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:40.100]   So you can imagine the hippocampal,
[00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:44.260]   the lack of those neuro progenitor cells,
[00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:47.020]   they're just not being stimulated.
[00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:47.900]   - It's super interesting.
[00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:49.200]   I wasn't aware of that result,
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:50.340]   so I appreciate you sharing it.
[00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:52.340]   I almost have to wonder if it's like exercise
[00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:55.380]   where so many people,
[00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:57.700]   I think now everybody hopefully understands
[00:26:57.700 --> 00:26:59.780]   that exercise is going to lower blood pressure,
[00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:03.340]   reduce resting heart rate, improve musculoskeletal function
[00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:05.380]   and bone density, all that stuff.
[00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:07.840]   But that if you took a snapshot of the bodily response
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:11.140]   during exercise, blood pressure is way, way up,
[00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:14.900]   heart rate is way, way up, stress hormones are way up,
[00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:16.340]   cortisol is through the roof
[00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:18.780]   during a hard workout and immediately afterwards.
[00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:21.100]   And yet that sets in motion a series of adaptations
[00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:23.840]   that brings you to a better place most of the time.
[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:25.980]   I almost wonder if stress is the same.
[00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:29.700]   Is there any evidence that short bouts of stress
[00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:31.540]   provided that they're managed well,
[00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:35.160]   meaning that we don't spend the next 24 or 48 hours
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:36.420]   ruminating on the stressor,
[00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:38.140]   but that we're able to move through the stressor
[00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:39.740]   and resolve it in some way,
[00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:41.780]   that that's actually beneficial for us
[00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:43.960]   because of the mobilization of energy stores
[00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:46.940]   and maybe even changing our threshold
[00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:50.060]   for reacting to stressors in the future?
[00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:51.220]   - It's a great question.
[00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:54.540]   And it's one that I have been chewing on for a while
[00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:57.820]   because we know, as you said, that physical stressors,
[00:27:57.820 --> 00:27:59.620]   when they're short and repeated,
[00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:02.120]   like high intensity interval training,
[00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:06.120]   they are promoting not just aerobic fitness,
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:07.240]   but stress fitness.
[00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:10.660]   People feel less rumination, less depression, less anxiety.
[00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:13.420]   So they're kind of tuning up the nervous system.
[00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:15.740]   What about psychological stressors?
[00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:18.500]   And we know two things.
[00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:22.460]   So one is, I do think that there is a level of engagement
[00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:27.180]   with moderate stressors that when we are used to them,
[00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:30.220]   we get fit and our stress resilience builds,
[00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:32.300]   meaning we're less threatened by them.
[00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:34.440]   So let me go deep into that.
[00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:38.220]   Two people can approach the exact same stressor
[00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:40.980]   and one person is having
[00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:44.120]   a pretty overreactive stress response
[00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:46.100]   where they basically are feeling
[00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:47.260]   their survival is threatened.
[00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:50.480]   So it's high cortisol, high vasoconstriction,
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:53.300]   and blood pressure goes up equally in both,
[00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:56.080]   but the person who's feeling super threatened,
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:29:00.260]   either their survival or their social survival, their ego,
[00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:01.340]   their blood pressure went up
[00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:03.200]   because of the vasoconstriction.
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:06.580]   The other person who is viewing the same stressor as,
[00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:10.100]   I can do this, this is a great challenge and opportunity.
[00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:11.740]   I have what it takes.
[00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:13.100]   Those types of thoughts
[00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:15.340]   generate a different hemodynamic response,
[00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:18.380]   which is actually more cardiac output.
[00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:20.940]   So blood pressure is going up, but in this healthier way,
[00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:24.280]   more oxygenation to the brain, better problem solving.
[00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:26.820]   They're able to maintain this positive outlook.
[00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:29.100]   So we've measured this threat challenge response
[00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:31.700]   in many lab studies and we know lots of things.
[00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:34.540]   So if you're having more of the challenge response,
[00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:36.680]   at the end of it, you're less inflamed.
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:39.280]   So just in the lab, within an hour or two,
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:40.980]   we see that they didn't trigger
[00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:43.180]   all that pro-inflammatory response.
[00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:45.140]   And their telomeres tend to be longer,
[00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:47.020]   which is a measure we can talk more about,
[00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:50.140]   but basically it looks like they have
[00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:53.260]   a slower speed of aging.
[00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:55.100]   - That is super interesting.
[00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:58.940]   You call this a stress challenge response?
[00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:02.260]   - So we could call this kind of a two,
[00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:03.360]   to be really simplistic,
[00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:07.020]   two types of psychological stress response,
[00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:09.800]   feeling threatened, like you're going to fail,
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:13.900]   you're embarrassed, that social pain response we know well,
[00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:17.860]   that feels terrible, but also that huge stress response
[00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:22.520]   when we feel it in our stomach, our heart is pounding.
[00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:25.080]   It's just an over-exaggerated response.
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:27.760]   That response biologically is different
[00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:30.320]   and the thoughts that go with it are different
[00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:31.940]   and we recover a lot slower.
[00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:33.780]   And then there's the challenge response,
[00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:38.780]   which is this, it's more of that kind of activated,
[00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:41.100]   excited response.
[00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:44.600]   And the beauty is that there are lots of studies out there
[00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:47.380]   done by emotions and social psychologists
[00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:50.400]   that tilt people toward the challenge response.
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:52.820]   We can actually promote that challenge response.
[00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:54.580]   And so when you asked about like,
[00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:58.420]   is it good to have a repeated stress response?
[00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:01.060]   Yes, if it's manageable, right?
[00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:04.500]   Then we're kind of building the muscle of stress resilience.
[00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:06.020]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:08.940]   and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.
[00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:11.380]   Athletic Greens, now called AG1,
[00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:13.740]   is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:16.640]   that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:19.340]   I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,
[00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:21.540]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:23.140]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:25.220]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:27.200]   once or usually twice a day
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:29.120]   is that it gets to be the probiotics
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:30.800]   that I need for gut health.
[00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:31.900]   Our gut is very important.
[00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:34.460]   It's populated by gut microbiota
[00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:36.220]   that communicate with the brain, the immune system,
[00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:38.620]   and basically all the biological systems of our body
[00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:42.260]   to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.
[00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:44.120]   And those probiotics in Athletic Greens
[00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:47.940]   are optimal and vital for microbiota health.
[00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:49.500]   In addition, Athletic Greens contains
[00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:51.420]   a number of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals
[00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:53.300]   that make sure that all of my foundational
[00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:56.760]   nutritional needs are met, and it tastes great.
[00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:58.220]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:01.600]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:03.580]   and they'll give you five free travel packs
[00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:05.900]   that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:07.180]   while you're on the road, in the car,
[00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:08.460]   on the plane, et cetera.
[00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:11.880]   And they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:14.580]   Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:15.940]   to get the five free travel packs
[00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:19.040]   and the year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:23.580]   What are the sorts of things that people, I, can do
[00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:25.700]   in order, including me, I should say,
[00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:30.660]   can do in order to wage that challenge response?
[00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:32.700]   Is this purely based on mindset?
[00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:36.660]   Like, instead of saying, why me, why this, why now?
[00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:38.280]   I can't believe this is happening.
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:41.300]   Is it a mental pivot to, okay,
[00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:44.100]   this is a great opportunity for growth.
[00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:45.540]   I don't know how I'm going to manage this,
[00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:46.800]   but I'll manage this.
[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:49.220]   You know, you want to stop me,
[00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:51.380]   you got to kill me type of mindset.
[00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:55.540]   Is that the switch that then the body follows?
[00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:56.860]   'Cause this is an interesting instance
[00:32:56.860 --> 00:33:01.860]   where most all the stress mitigation work that my lab does
[00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:04.120]   is focused on using the body to control the mind.
[00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:04.960]   But here we're talking about
[00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:06.880]   the mind controlling the body first
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:08.620]   and then the body following suit,
[00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:11.300]   which I find equally fascinating.
[00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:14.240]   So are there some specific mental scripts
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:18.260]   that people follow and are we all able
[00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:20.140]   to follow those scripts?
[00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:23.500]   - Yes, to some extent, we control the script.
[00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:26.440]   We can use that script to prepare ourselves
[00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:28.680]   going into a stressful situation.
[00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:31.120]   And we can use it at any point during the stressor.
[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:33.220]   So some of us are just wired
[00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:35.140]   to have a big threat response period.
[00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:38.500]   Maybe it's, you know, it's epigenetics we've inherited.
[00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:41.140]   Maybe it's early trauma that has shaped us
[00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:44.240]   to have this exaggerated emotional response.
[00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:45.880]   And yes, we and others have found that.
[00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:49.580]   Trauma sensitizes our emotional stress response
[00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:51.700]   so that we are feeling more threatened.
[00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:54.400]   But that's okay because that's the part we can't control.
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:57.900]   And we just have to have a lot of self-compassion
[00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:01.200]   and awareness that, okay, this is what I do.
[00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:05.300]   My body reacts like this, but what happens next?
[00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:08.780]   That's when we can start to use those statements,
[00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:11.860]   self-comforting, self-compassion, distancing.
[00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:12.940]   There's all sorts of statements
[00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:16.020]   that allow us to then recover more quickly.
[00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:22.220]   - So when we want to shift from a threatened response
[00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:24.080]   to a kind of challenge response,
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:28.100]   are there any data that dictate whether or not
[00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:31.340]   we should keep those statements in our head,
[00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:33.420]   write them down, say them out loud?
[00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:34.340]   I guess what I'm trying to do here
[00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:35.540]   is trying to get to a little bit more
[00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:40.380]   of the meat of the actionable, since a lot of our listeners,
[00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:43.940]   I think we'll be, as I am, very excited about the idea
[00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:46.740]   that a mere shift in our mentality about stress
[00:34:46.740 --> 00:34:48.540]   can give us the opposite outcome.
[00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:50.340]   I mean, before you were talking about vasoconstriction
[00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:54.200]   and inflammation and all these bad things,
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:56.100]   to put it lightly.
[00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:59.880]   And then in the challenge response to stress,
[00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:02.240]   getting the exact opposite, more vasodilation,
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:05.060]   more resources used and more positive effects
[00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:06.380]   on the brain and body.
[00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:10.220]   So what are some, if you can recall from the papers,
[00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:11.060]   if not, that's fine.
[00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:11.900]   - No, no, I can give you some statements.
[00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:14.860]   - But I'm just curious what those specific tools might be.
[00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:17.660]   - Every statement you said, Andrew, is good.
[00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:18.620]   It's a good one.
[00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:21.580]   The whole trick here is that people need to find
[00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:25.960]   the strength statements, the stress shields, I call them,
[00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:28.900]   that fit them, that feels right and that they believe.
[00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:33.580]   And so I list a bunch of options in chapter three,
[00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:36.540]   which is called be the lion instead of the gazelle.
[00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:39.700]   So the lion and gazelle are both high blood pressure,
[00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:42.220]   high stress, and the lion's chasing the gazelle,
[00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:44.820]   but the gazelle's having this total threat
[00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:48.260]   vasoconstriction response 'cause she might die.
[00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:50.620]   Lion might get dinner, right?
[00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:52.440]   So it's needing to mount the stress response
[00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:55.980]   because it's so excited to get the tasty dinner
[00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:57.820]   for the next few days.
[00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:00.900]   And so the lion is having that challenge response.
[00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:04.260]   And so we can remind ourselves, be the lion.
[00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:06.220]   It's not that we're always lion or gazelle.
[00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:08.100]   We get to shape that.
[00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:10.140]   And so some of those statements are,
[00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:13.180]   well, let's say right when we're going into it,
[00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:15.020]   list your resources.
[00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:17.480]   Have you ever dealt with any situation like this?
[00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:19.760]   Remind yourself of past successes.
[00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:22.780]   Remind yourself of someone you can call or text
[00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:24.700]   or feel supported by.
[00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:27.900]   Remind yourself that this outcome is not gonna affect
[00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:29.760]   your life in 10 years or five years.
[00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:33.600]   That's a distancing kind of perspective taking.
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:35.060]   So there's all these strategies
[00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:37.500]   and you gotta use what works for you.
[00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:39.740]   It's telling yourself, I got this, I can do it.
[00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:40.980]   I can get through it.
[00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:42.300]   I have what it takes.
[00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:44.660]   Those are all good shields.
[00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:48.660]   And another set is, some of us feel really stressed out
[00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:49.500]   by stress.
[00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:51.840]   Like once we feel our heart racing,
[00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:56.340]   that leads to, oh no, this is bad for me.
[00:36:56.340 --> 00:37:00.120]   And so rather than getting stressed by stress,
[00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:02.120]   we actually want to remind ourselves
[00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:05.400]   that this stress response is empowering.
[00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:08.080]   This is going to help me cope.
[00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:10.060]   My body's excited.
[00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:13.640]   My body is doing just what it should right now.
[00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:18.040]   So that reframing in studies by Wendy Mendez and others,
[00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:20.640]   my colleagues who do this reappraisal research,
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:22.400]   they have basically trained people
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:24.280]   to view stress as positive.
[00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:27.220]   During the stressful situations in the lab,
[00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:28.980]   people do better.
[00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:30.080]   They perform better.
[00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:31.640]   They feel more positive emotion.
[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:33.280]   They problem solve better.
[00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:34.820]   They recover more quickly.
[00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:37.360]   So pretty powerful stuff.
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:39.380]   - Yeah, that is powerful stuff.
[00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:41.720]   I'm wondering if we can talk about the relationship
[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:43.720]   between stress and eating.
[00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:45.880]   And I think that's also a great opportunity
[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:47.660]   for us to talk about the opioid system.
[00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:48.740]   A lot of people are familiar
[00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:53.060]   with the so-called opioid epidemic and opioid crisis.
[00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:57.880]   Sadly, far too many people are dying of fentanyl overdoses.
[00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:01.720]   And we all know about the OxyContin epidemic
[00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:03.800]   and all of these people addicted to opioids.
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:06.940]   And that's not really what this is about.
[00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:10.140]   What we're about to talk about is the fact
[00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:13.260]   that we have an opioid system within us
[00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:16.100]   that is neurons and other cell types
[00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:17.580]   that can reduce, excuse me,
[00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:20.020]   can release substances into our brain and body
[00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:23.100]   that make us feel less pain and make us feel sedated,
[00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:25.420]   but at a healthy level, right?
[00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:28.960]   And yet there are a lot of things besides drugs
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:31.700]   that can activate this opioid system.
[00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:34.580]   I think sex activates the endogenous opioid system.
[00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:37.220]   As far as I last read, there was a paper out recently,
[00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:39.460]   but also food can do it.
[00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:41.580]   And again, to healthy levels,
[00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:43.840]   provided the context is healthy, of course.
[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:47.700]   What is the relationship between stress and eating
[00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:50.080]   and eating and the opioid system?
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:54.140]   - Stress and eating is an interesting one.
[00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:57.300]   So most people, when they feel stressed,
[00:38:57.300 --> 00:38:58.980]   or I'm just gonna ask you,
[00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:01.500]   do you eat more or less when you're stressed?
[00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:02.940]   - Less, definitely.
[00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:05.620]   I feel like I can go two, three days without food
[00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:07.460]   when I'm really stressed.
[00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:11.760]   But I came up in a profession where, sadly for me,
[00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:14.380]   all-nighters were part of the regular
[00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:16.540]   until pretty recently, a couple of years ago,
[00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:18.740]   and I just called an end to that.
[00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:21.900]   And no, it wasn't just because of procrastination.
[00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:23.680]   It was just work overload.
[00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:26.260]   But I can go a long period of time without eating,
[00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:27.620]   although I love to eat.
[00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:30.340]   So I do point out that I do love to eat.
[00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:31.540]   - And what does the body feel like
[00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:32.860]   when you're in that stress state,
[00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:33.860]   when you're not even hungry,
[00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:36.860]   you're kind of shut down in your digestion?
[00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:39.620]   - That I have enough energy from my neural resources,
[00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:41.100]   from adrenaline.
[00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:44.740]   And generally those periods of time when I'm not hungry
[00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:49.460]   coincide with a hyper-focus on the stressor,
[00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:53.700]   the deadline, whatever it is in life that needs tending to.
[00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:57.240]   And food just doesn't appeal to me as much.
[00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:59.580]   It doesn't taste as good and it's not as enticing.
[00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:03.100]   - Yeah, so we think that either your type
[00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:06.660]   of body temperament is high sympathetic.
[00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:09.180]   And so when you have a big stress response,
[00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:11.980]   your digestion is pretty much shut down.
[00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:13.660]   Like it would be the opposite.
[00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:14.620]   Eating would be the opposite
[00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:16.540]   of what your body's telling you to do.
[00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:18.620]   - I'm just going to forgive me for interrupting.
[00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:20.780]   For those of you hearing sympathetic,
[00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:21.920]   we're not talking about sympathy.
[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:23.960]   We're talking about the sympathetic arm
[00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:25.060]   of the autonomic nervous system,
[00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:27.300]   which is the so-called fight or flight arm
[00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:28.500]   as opposed to the parasympathetic.
[00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:29.740]   In any event, sorry to interrupt,
[00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:32.880]   but want to make sure that sometimes people hear sympathy
[00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:35.060]   and then I think emotional sympathy.
[00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:37.420]   I like to think I have that too, but okay.
[00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:41.140]   So I tend to lean more towards the sympathetic,
[00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:44.740]   meaning more alertness arousal
[00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:46.820]   on the seesaw of the autonomic nervous system.
[00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:49.700]   - And I'm a high sympathetic reactor.
[00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:51.540]   I lose weight when I go through,
[00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:52.840]   like writing my dissertation.
[00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:55.020]   I looked like a skeleton at the end.
[00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:57.340]   But that's not what most people complain about.
[00:40:57.340 --> 00:40:58.280]   It's not weight loss.
[00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:01.140]   Most people complain about overeating or binge eating
[00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:02.940]   when they're emotional, when they're stressed.
[00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:05.640]   And so that's the more common pattern.
[00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:09.340]   And that looks different
[00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:11.340]   both in the brain and biologically.
[00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:16.340]   And so what it looks like is that the stress response
[00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:21.820]   is driving cravings and also let's say high insulin
[00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:24.340]   or an insulin resistant state.
[00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:26.100]   And what goes along with that
[00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:28.820]   is tending to be overweight or have obesity.
[00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:32.540]   And so just by whether it's through conditioning
[00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:36.100]   or genetics, having that kind of larger body
[00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:39.580]   with a big stress eating temperament, that is a challenge
[00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:40.420]   in life.
[00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:42.620]   And I've been, you know, I've worked with people
[00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:44.940]   with different eating conditions, eating disorders,
[00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:49.940]   binge eating, and it is a, what's hard about it
[00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:52.860]   is number one, it's very common in normative
[00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:57.780]   to just feel like you can't feel satiated.
[00:41:57.780 --> 00:41:59.640]   So it's this compulsive eating tendency
[00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:01.640]   that stress brings you to.
[00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:05.980]   And so what it means, we measure this,
[00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:06.820]   it's very easy to measure.
[00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:09.760]   It means that people feel like they can't control
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:11.520]   their eating, they don't get full.
[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:15.580]   They think about food a lot.
[00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:18.480]   And so stress kind of exacerbates that tendency.
[00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:21.440]   And that is a, you know, it's a common phenotype.
[00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:23.800]   Like we've studied it and maybe 50% of people
[00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:25.600]   with obesity have that.
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:27.300]   Do lean people have that?
[00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:30.380]   Some, not many, like less than 20%.
[00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:34.020]   But what they also have is this tremendous kind of diet,
[00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:36.280]   what we call dietary strain or control over their eating.
[00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:40.860]   So they're able to not overeat,
[00:42:40.860 --> 00:42:43.840]   even though they're thinking about food a lot.
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:47.300]   So that's, that is, you know, that explains that unusual
[00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:51.540]   body of someone who's really more,
[00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:54.000]   still has those compulsive traits.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.280]   So why does this matter?
[00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:59.160]   This makes it really hard to eat well,
[00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:00.560]   'cause when you're stressed,
[00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:03.140]   you're craving the comfort food, the high fat,
[00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:07.340]   high sugar, high salt, depending on your temperament.
[00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:12.260]   And that is, that means with repeated bouts of stress,
[00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:13.540]   you're just gonna be gaining weight,
[00:43:13.540 --> 00:43:16.000]   and particularly in the intra-abdominal area.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:16.840]   That's what we've seen.
[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:18.080]   We've seen it cross-sexually.
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:20.940]   We've seen it in rat studies and mice studies.
[00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:22.420]   And now we've seen it in people.
[00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:24.600]   And many, for about 10 years, I studied this.
[00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:27.320]   And the question was, is what's happening in people
[00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:28.800]   the same thing that's happening in mice?
[00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:31.440]   If you stress them out and you give them Oreos,
[00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:33.580]   the mice develop binge eating.
[00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:36.280]   They get really compulsive and they get this, you know,
[00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:39.460]   terrible metabolic health profile, metabolic syndrome,
[00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:43.380]   where their round, you know, their belly fat
[00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:45.520]   basically expands like a cushion.
[00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:47.580]   And that's 'cause that's this really good,
[00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:49.360]   immediate source of energy during stress.
[00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:51.680]   So like, we're really well-wired to,
[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:53.700]   if our body thinks we're under chronic stress,
[00:43:53.700 --> 00:43:56.540]   we're gonna store stress fat or abdominal fat,
[00:43:56.540 --> 00:43:58.980]   so we can just mobilize that in a second.
[00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:01.360]   And then the second question we've asked is,
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:04.160]   can you reverse that with different interventions?
[00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:07.040]   Can you block the compulsive eating?
[00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:09.860]   So I can tell you what we found there.
[00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:11.520]   But the opioid system that you mentioned
[00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:13.240]   is certainly involved.
[00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:16.940]   And in studies with people,
[00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:18.900]   lean people and people with obesity,
[00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:21.280]   my colleague, Rajita Sinha at Yale,
[00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:24.520]   has basically found that when you stress them out,
[00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:29.480]   people with obesity are having a different reward response.
[00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:32.840]   And the more insulin resistant they are,
[00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:36.240]   the more their reward center lights up during stress.
[00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:38.560]   - And what's causal there?
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:40.120]   Like, what's the chicken, what's the egg?
[00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:42.300]   So, 'cause I can imagine these were people
[00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:46.100]   that at one time were not obese who got stressed.
[00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:52.180]   The opioid system reacted in a particularly potent way
[00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:56.240]   to food, and they were able to clamp their stress,
[00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:58.520]   and so then they become binge eaters
[00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:01.200]   in the context of stress.
[00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:04.280]   And that leads to insulin insensitivity.
[00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:05.120]   - Exactly.
[00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:07.920]   - I could also imagine that they were insulin insensitive,
[00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:09.120]   therefore they need to eat more
[00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:14.040]   in order to feel kind of an increase in satiety,
[00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:18.960]   as we know this now, based on brain and body mechanisms.
[00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:23.280]   And then that set off a cascade of things leading to obesity.
[00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:27.060]   Not that it necessarily matters, but what's causal?
[00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:27.900]   Do we know if stress-
[00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:29.100]   - Oh, I think it really does matter.
[00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:32.900]   I think there's been a mistake of kind of confounding
[00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:37.900]   all obesity with food addiction and metabolic disease,
[00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:39.520]   and it's completely heterogeneous.
[00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:41.400]   So I think it's the developmental path
[00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:45.300]   that you're describing, which is that there's a tendency
[00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:48.760]   toward having a bigger reward response
[00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:50.960]   and hunger during stress.
[00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:53.120]   So it becomes a way of coping, a lifestyle,
[00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:56.600]   and that is a pathway toward obesity.
[00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:59.500]   And so some obese people
[00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:03.420]   have a dysregulated stress response, but not all of them.
[00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:06.040]   I mean, it really is a certain type of person.
[00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:09.440]   So that's why we target people with cravings.
[00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:11.240]   In all of our intervention studies now,
[00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:15.080]   we wanna know who has more of the compulsive eating type,
[00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:18.560]   because they need a different set of skills
[00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:23.560]   to cope with stress and to lose weight if that's their goal.
[00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:26.680]   - There's a drug, I'm sure you're familiar with naltrexone,
[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:28.760]   which can block the opioid receptor.
[00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:30.960]   It's used to block the opioid receptor
[00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:33.020]   in the context of different types of addiction.
[00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:35.160]   Have people tried to use naltrexone
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:36.440]   in the context of binge eating,
[00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:37.920]   and does it help people lose weight?
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:41.240]   Because it presumably reduces
[00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:44.240]   some of the rewarding properties of food.
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:47.320]   - That's one of the very few drug combinations
[00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:48.540]   that has been used for binge eating.
[00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:51.840]   So it was a combination of naltrexone and wellbutrin.
[00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:53.160]   And I'm not sure at this moment
[00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:56.060]   how much that's favored for binge eating,
[00:46:56.060 --> 00:46:57.840]   but certainly the early trials showed
[00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:00.760]   that it really does damp down on the compulsive eating.
[00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:04.440]   - Interesting, so is that a commonly prescribed kit
[00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:06.240]   of drugs now for obesity?
[00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:07.580]   I know there's a lot of excitement nowadays
[00:47:07.580 --> 00:47:11.760]   about these semaglutide analogs,
[00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:14.240]   because they do seem very effective in blocking hunger,
[00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:15.740]   especially in type 2 diabetics.
[00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:16.720]   I don't know if you're familiar with it,
[00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:18.720]   but there's all the rage,
[00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:20.760]   mostly because people saw the before and after photos
[00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:22.840]   of Elon, he had his shirt off on a boat,
[00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:25.360]   and there were some not so nice comments made about him.
[00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:28.000]   And then sometime later, he was quite a bit lighter,
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.040]   and he announced that he had been taking
[00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:32.480]   one of these semaglutide agonists.
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:35.520]   - Yeah, I really hope that we come up
[00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:38.200]   with safe and effective drugs.
[00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:43.200]   And one thing to think about is that the challenge
[00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:46.360]   that we all have, particularly if we're prone to obesity,
[00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:48.040]   is the toxic food environment,
[00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:49.600]   and particularly the refined sugar.
[00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:52.640]   And regardless of what we're on metformin
[00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:55.320]   or one of these drugs, we override it with our diet.
[00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:59.020]   And really, the improved nutrition is the only way
[00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:00.640]   to solve it as a public health problem.
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:03.040]   I mean, the drug companies are saying everyone should be,
[00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:04.200]   everyone with a certain BMI
[00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:05.480]   should be on one of these new drugs,
[00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:06.920]   and it's just rubbish,
[00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:10.000]   and it's not going to lead to long-term health.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.680]   - Well, I know you have a colleague there at UCSF,
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:16.000]   Dr. Robert Lustig, who's been talking about
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:17.800]   sugars and hidden sugars for years
[00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:18.920]   and the problems with that,
[00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:21.120]   and we don't want to demonize sugar
[00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:24.060]   as the only cause of the obesity epidemic,
[00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:25.160]   but it's certainly one of them.
[00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:27.520]   At least that's my belief, according to the data.
[00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:30.040]   - Yes, and Rob is the biggest proponent
[00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:34.680]   of helping people understand the big problem and the root
[00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:37.040]   is in the processed food and the sugar,
[00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:39.200]   and that the drugs don't touch that.
[00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:43.400]   We just, we override effects of any drugs with our diet.
[00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:48.400]   And so it's been a losing battle really
[00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:54.660]   because of the force of big food and big pharma.
[00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:57.920]   So let me go back to the compulsive eating.
[00:48:57.920 --> 00:49:01.840]   So there are some clues about how to break that cycle.
[00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:05.200]   So one is in our weight loss trials
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:07.560]   or our healthy mindful eating trials,
[00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:11.000]   we find that mindful eating
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.560]   is not gonna cause a lot of weight loss period,
[00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:16.440]   but the people who benefit most from learning
[00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:18.780]   this kind of calm self-regulation
[00:49:18.780 --> 00:49:22.380]   where you check in with your hunger, you slow down,
[00:49:22.380 --> 00:49:25.160]   you increase your awareness of your body,
[00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:27.440]   so interoceptive awareness,
[00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:32.440]   that type of skill is really critical
[00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:35.180]   for people with compulsive eating.
[00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:37.800]   And so in our trials, we find that if they,
[00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:39.640]   people with compulsive eating, if they get that,
[00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:41.920]   if they get randomized to the mindful eating,
[00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:44.940]   they do better in terms of their insulin resistance
[00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:47.580]   and their glucose and their long-term weight loss.
[00:49:47.580 --> 00:49:49.080]   So that's one good clue.
[00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:52.800]   Another is the positive stress pathway
[00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:55.800]   looks important for breaking the compulsive eating cycle.
[00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:58.560]   So high intensity interval training,
[00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:01.400]   or maybe some of these other ways
[00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:03.600]   that we've been talking about
[00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:06.560]   to increase the bodily stress in these short-term ways
[00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:10.640]   to metabolize stress in our body can help with the cravings.
[00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:12.800]   - So what would that look like in the context of,
[00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:15.460]   let's say somebody has the opposite phenotype to me.
[00:50:15.460 --> 00:50:16.300]   They get stressed
[00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:18.300]   and they find themselves reaching for snack food
[00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:20.680]   or that they simply can't reach satiety.
[00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:22.880]   They just want to eat and eat and eat.
[00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:24.040]   What are some of the,
[00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:25.760]   aside from naltrexone and wellbutrin
[00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:28.040]   and some of these prescription approaches,
[00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:30.660]   'cause I always say while I value,
[00:50:30.660 --> 00:50:33.060]   certainly value prescription drugs in certain contexts,
[00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:35.160]   I always feel like behavior should come first,
[00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:39.400]   dos and don'ts, then nutrition, then supplementation,
[00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:42.340]   and then if and only if it still needed prescription drugs.
[00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:44.720]   But that's just my bias based on my observations.
[00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:45.880]   - Pretty reasonable.
[00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:47.120]   - I like to think so.
[00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:51.520]   It also is a, it starts at a zero cost endeavor.
[00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:53.280]   I mean, behaviors require time,
[00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:56.240]   but it certainly includes everybody,
[00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:58.160]   not just those that have insurance
[00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:00.960]   or that live in a particular region of the US or the world.
[00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:03.500]   So anyway, that's my bias.
[00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:04.600]   And at least for the time being,
[00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:06.280]   I'm sticking with it.
[00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:07.780]   It's the basis of a lot of what we talk about
[00:51:07.780 --> 00:51:08.620]   on this podcast.
[00:51:08.620 --> 00:51:12.600]   But nonetheless, if somebody is finding themselves
[00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:15.360]   in that category of binge eating
[00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:16.560]   or heading towards binge eating
[00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:20.060]   or using food to comfort or alleviate stress,
[00:51:20.060 --> 00:51:25.000]   how should they intervene in their own thoughts and behavior?
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:28.440]   - We talked about the bins, top-down strategies,
[00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:30.160]   changing the body, changing the scene.
[00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:31.060]   We need all of those.
[00:51:31.060 --> 00:51:33.800]   I mean, the compulsive drive to eat
[00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:36.840]   is one of our strongest impulses
[00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:38.700]   if we've developed that pathway.
[00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:42.640]   And so we train people, for example,
[00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:47.460]   in mindful awareness of separating out emotions from hunger.
[00:51:47.460 --> 00:51:48.960]   So they get really wrapped up together.
[00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:50.860]   So just labeling how you're feeling,
[00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:53.280]   labeling your hunger from one to 10,
[00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:56.820]   and figuring out, am I really hungry or is it boredom?
[00:51:56.820 --> 00:51:57.660]   That helps people.
[00:51:57.660 --> 00:52:00.160]   And if you do that check-in right before you eat,
[00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:01.360]   that helps the most.
[00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:04.120]   So that's the top-down mindful check-in.
[00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:09.120]   The other thing we help people do is like ride the craving,
[00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:11.640]   surf the urge.
[00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:16.640]   So we deal a lot with soda drinkers and it is addictive.
[00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:18.960]   And there is nothing worse
[00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:21.260]   than drinking sugar soda for our body.
[00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:26.260]   So we help people by having them watch their craving pass
[00:52:26.260 --> 00:52:30.880]   and knowing that it's a matter of time
[00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:34.840]   that they can surf the urge without jumping to consuming.
[00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:37.040]   And so that practice helps some people,
[00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:39.100]   especially with practice.
[00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:42.400]   The pushups, the taking a walk, the changing the scene,
[00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:44.440]   getting away from food
[00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:47.160]   is always gonna be a huge, strong strategy
[00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:49.460]   if you can get yourself away from it.
[00:52:49.460 --> 00:52:51.640]   The problem is, as you know,
[00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:53.680]   is that the cravings get you to the buffet.
[00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:57.080]   They drive you to the soda, et cetera.
[00:52:57.080 --> 00:53:00.160]   And so just creating safe environments,
[00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:01.400]   both at home and in the workplace
[00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:03.400]   where you don't have soda is really important.
[00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:05.480]   So we try that at UCSF.
[00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:08.520]   My colleagues and I, including Rob Lustig,
[00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:10.520]   the anti-sugar doctor,
[00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:14.840]   we just saw the absurdity of being a medical center.
[00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:17.120]   People come with these chronic diseases
[00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:19.720]   and what are they served in the cafeteria
[00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:21.820]   or even at their bedside?
[00:53:21.820 --> 00:53:22.720]   Sugared Coke.
[00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:24.640]   - In the hospital. - In the hospital.
[00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:27.160]   And so my colleague, Laura Schmidt,
[00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:30.440]   who's partly responsible for the soda tax,
[00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:34.140]   she rallied all the...
[00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:35.920]   We went top down to administration,
[00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:37.560]   but bottom up to vendors,
[00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:38.680]   got rid of all the soda
[00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:40.800]   in all of our hospitals and campuses.
[00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:42.160]   And we found two things.
[00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:46.880]   Number one, people who were heavy drinkers
[00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:50.960]   lost weight in the most important place, their waste.
[00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:52.920]   - Heavy soda drinkers? - Mm-hmm.
[00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:55.200]   So when we took it out of the workplace,
[00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:57.760]   they actually, their health improved.
[00:53:57.760 --> 00:54:02.240]   And number two, those with compulsive eating,
[00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:04.200]   they score high on our little scale
[00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:06.600]   for reward-based drive.
[00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:09.660]   It didn't help them.
[00:54:09.660 --> 00:54:14.320]   So then we randomized half of them to get some extra boost.
[00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:15.600]   We call it motivational interviewing
[00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:17.520]   where we're really supporting them more
[00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:19.720]   and helping them think of goals
[00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:22.520]   like being with their grandchildren, not getting diabetes.
[00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:27.360]   And that little bit of support helped them tremendously.
[00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:29.820]   And so now we're trying to roll that out
[00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:32.160]   in a big controlled trial.
[00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:35.000]   But at least a hundred hospitals have adopted
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:38.300]   the stop selling sugary drinks
[00:54:38.300 --> 00:54:40.080]   because people don't want to be sick,
[00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:43.160]   but they can't help it if they have the reward drive.
[00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:44.720]   And if they have the compulsivity
[00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:45.840]   and it's right there at work,
[00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:47.820]   we're just working against health.
[00:54:47.820 --> 00:54:49.900]   - That's super interesting.
[00:54:49.900 --> 00:54:53.300]   I think that for most of us,
[00:54:53.300 --> 00:54:55.500]   we think about soda as the kind of thing
[00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:57.760]   that maybe we had every once in a while
[00:54:57.760 --> 00:54:59.300]   or that we drank more when we were kids.
[00:54:59.300 --> 00:55:02.460]   I seem to have lost my appetite for soda at some point.
[00:55:02.460 --> 00:55:04.400]   - You just know too much. - Teen years.
[00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:07.600]   Maybe, or just at some point I started to feel
[00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:09.340]   like there were better alternatives.
[00:55:09.340 --> 00:55:11.660]   And you know- - Like what?
[00:55:11.660 --> 00:55:13.520]   - Well, okay, well- - People want ideas.
[00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:14.580]   - Yeah, well, full confession.
[00:55:14.580 --> 00:55:18.840]   I mean, okay, most of my non-water beverage consumption
[00:55:18.840 --> 00:55:23.240]   is going to be either coffee, usually black coffee,
[00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:25.780]   or nowadays I sometimes will throw some ketones in there,
[00:55:25.780 --> 00:55:27.180]   not 'cause I'm on a ketogenic diet,
[00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:30.660]   but for, I do feel like it makes my level of focus
[00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:31.500]   and cognition better.
[00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:32.460]   - Is that what you were pouring in this morning?
[00:55:32.460 --> 00:55:34.580]   - Yeah, I do use it before podcasts
[00:55:34.580 --> 00:55:36.180]   and we're prepping for podcasts.
[00:55:36.180 --> 00:55:42.040]   There are good data showing that we can all utilize ketones
[00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:44.980]   as a brain fuel, even if we're not on ketogenic diet.
[00:55:44.980 --> 00:55:47.660]   That's clear to me based on my experience
[00:55:47.660 --> 00:55:50.800]   and the data as I see them and understand them.
[00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:55.580]   Or yerba mate tea, which is just a caffeinated tea
[00:55:55.580 --> 00:55:58.040]   from South America, which I like very much.
[00:55:58.040 --> 00:56:03.240]   However, I am guilty of drinking the occasional diet soda
[00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:04.320]   every once in a while.
[00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:06.680]   And I know that some of my audience will just gasp,
[00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:07.520]   how could I do that?
[00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:09.000]   But we're talking about the occasional diet coke.
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:11.100]   - Diet soda. - The occasional diet coke.
[00:56:11.100 --> 00:56:13.940]   Mostly 'cause I don't like the taste of sugary soda.
[00:56:13.940 --> 00:56:16.360]   And I actually really like the taste of diet soda.
[00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:19.560]   Aspartame is a particularly rewarding taste for me.
[00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:23.920]   And as a consequence, I try and avoid drinking it more than,
[00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:28.660]   I might have a can of diet coke once a month maximum,
[00:56:28.660 --> 00:56:30.460]   usually on a plane or something like that.
[00:56:30.460 --> 00:56:32.400]   So that's the extent of it.
[00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:35.780]   But if I have the choice between a really great coffee
[00:56:35.780 --> 00:56:37.420]   and a soda, it's going to be coffee.
[00:56:37.420 --> 00:56:40.500]   Or yerba mate in a soda, it's going to be yerba mate.
[00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:43.220]   Or food and soda, I'm going to eat instead.
[00:56:43.220 --> 00:56:44.380]   And so that's me.
[00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:47.060]   But I do recall, as a teenager,
[00:56:47.060 --> 00:56:48.440]   soda was kind of a default.
[00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:50.080]   You would just kind of go to the soda fountain
[00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:50.920]   and fill the drink.
[00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:52.860]   It felt like such a rewarding thing.
[00:56:52.860 --> 00:56:55.640]   And I think the reason we're drilling into this more deeply
[00:56:55.640 --> 00:56:57.420]   is it sounds to me based on what you said earlier
[00:56:57.420 --> 00:56:58.920]   in my read of the literature,
[00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:03.660]   also brings me the idea that drinking sugar
[00:57:03.660 --> 00:57:05.780]   in the form of liquid is one of the worst things
[00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:08.060]   that we can do in terms of our bodily regulation
[00:57:08.060 --> 00:57:09.380]   of insulin and glucose.
[00:57:09.380 --> 00:57:12.700]   I don't want to use the words empty calories
[00:57:12.700 --> 00:57:14.020]   because that's kind of a loaded phrase,
[00:57:14.020 --> 00:57:15.480]   but it is essentially empty calories.
[00:57:15.480 --> 00:57:16.320]   It doesn't involve-
[00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:17.140]   - Well, it's harmful calories.
[00:57:17.140 --> 00:57:17.980]   They're not empty.
[00:57:17.980 --> 00:57:19.480]   - Yeah, I mean, there are no amino acids in there.
[00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:20.920]   There are no essential fatty acids.
[00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:22.220]   And there aren't many carbohydrates
[00:57:22.220 --> 00:57:25.220]   that you can really utilize for long-term bouts
[00:57:25.220 --> 00:57:26.580]   of mental or physical work.
[00:57:26.580 --> 00:57:31.580]   So do you view soda as one of the worst,
[00:57:31.580 --> 00:57:34.660]   certainly not the best,
[00:57:34.660 --> 00:57:36.580]   but one of the worst culprits out there?
[00:57:36.580 --> 00:57:37.740]   I mean, it is really prominent,
[00:57:37.740 --> 00:57:40.340]   especially nowadays also we should include energy drinks.
[00:57:40.340 --> 00:57:42.940]   A lot of kids, especially males, by the way,
[00:57:42.940 --> 00:57:44.580]   it's almost, this is crazy.
[00:57:44.580 --> 00:57:49.580]   It's almost 95% of energy drink consumption is males.
[00:57:49.580 --> 00:57:50.620]   - Interesting.
[00:57:50.620 --> 00:57:51.820]   - And I don't know what it is.
[00:57:51.820 --> 00:57:52.820]   Maybe it's the packaging
[00:57:52.820 --> 00:57:55.240]   or how the marketing has been pitched.
[00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:56.860]   But by the way, as soon as I say that,
[00:57:56.860 --> 00:57:58.140]   someone will be in the YouTube comments
[00:57:58.140 --> 00:57:59.540]   telling me that that's completely false,
[00:57:59.540 --> 00:58:01.660]   but we can point you to the data.
[00:58:01.660 --> 00:58:03.540]   So what are your thoughts on sugary drinks
[00:58:03.540 --> 00:58:04.600]   and what that's doing?
[00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:07.880]   Do you think this is a reaction
[00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:09.980]   to how much stress people are experiencing?
[00:58:09.980 --> 00:58:13.540]   Is this like people's attempt to inoculate their stress,
[00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:15.940]   or is it simply that it tastes good and it's easy to consume
[00:58:15.940 --> 00:58:18.200]   and it's relatively inexpensive?
[00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:21.920]   - People have not, and we have not really studied
[00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:25.780]   the sugary drinks in the same way we have studied
[00:58:25.780 --> 00:58:27.980]   the comfort food and the binge eating.
[00:58:27.980 --> 00:58:32.980]   And so my guess is that it is part of a stress response,
[00:58:32.980 --> 00:58:38.840]   but even more than that, it's part of the hedonic cycle.
[00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:40.900]   So when you get the sugar,
[00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:42.660]   especially if it's packed with caffeine,
[00:58:42.660 --> 00:58:44.580]   that's gonna be a more addictive drink,
[00:58:44.580 --> 00:58:49.420]   you get this really feel-good response right away.
[00:58:49.420 --> 00:58:53.480]   And then you get the low and it's the hedonic withdrawal,
[00:58:53.480 --> 00:58:56.340]   so which is this, you actually feel bad
[00:58:56.340 --> 00:58:58.680]   when it's been a while since you've had it.
[00:58:58.680 --> 00:59:01.020]   And so then it drives the compulsivity.
[00:59:01.020 --> 00:59:02.720]   You want it again because you wanna,
[00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:03.560]   not 'cause you wanna feel good,
[00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:05.380]   you wanna get rid of feeling bad.
[00:59:05.380 --> 00:59:07.940]   So that's what happens with both food addiction,
[00:59:07.940 --> 00:59:09.860]   and we think that happens with sugary drinks.
[00:59:09.860 --> 00:59:12.900]   Now, let me tell you that when you asked,
[00:59:12.900 --> 00:59:14.920]   is a sugary drink one of the worst things
[00:59:14.920 --> 00:59:16.260]   we can do for our health?
[00:59:16.260 --> 00:59:21.260]   Yes, because sugary food doesn't go to our brain
[00:59:21.260 --> 00:59:25.560]   as quickly as a liquid sugar, a sugary drink.
[00:59:25.560 --> 00:59:28.260]   So think about cocaine and crack.
[00:59:28.260 --> 00:59:30.580]   Crack goes to the brain immediately
[00:59:30.580 --> 00:59:32.460]   and it's that much more addictive.
[00:59:32.460 --> 00:59:34.740]   That's how we think of liquid sugar.
[00:59:34.740 --> 00:59:38.020]   The view on sugar, I think is starting to change.
[00:59:38.020 --> 00:59:39.420]   And I think in the years to come,
[00:59:39.420 --> 00:59:42.540]   provided folks like you and Dr. Lustig
[00:59:42.540 --> 00:59:46.680]   continue to be vocal about it, which I hope you will,
[00:59:46.680 --> 00:59:49.940]   I think it's gonna shift things quite a bit.
[00:59:49.940 --> 00:59:52.380]   I look at it a little bit like trans fats.
[00:59:52.380 --> 00:59:54.180]   You know, when I was growing up, people ate margarine
[00:59:54.180 --> 00:59:57.760]   and now like trans fats are banned in many cities.
[00:59:57.760 --> 00:59:59.180]   It's kind of incredible how these things
[00:59:59.180 --> 01:00:01.820]   have changed over time.
[01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:04.300]   And it requires an effort, not just on social media,
[01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:09.300]   but podcasts and I think also lobbying our politicians,
[01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:11.420]   really getting them to understand
[01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:13.420]   just how pernicious this stuff is.
[01:00:13.420 --> 01:00:15.780]   - There's a lot of social norms that go into like,
[01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:19.740]   what's good for all of us as a group or community
[01:00:19.740 --> 01:00:21.140]   and what's personal choice.
[01:00:21.140 --> 01:00:22.500]   It's very fiery.
[01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:24.960]   You know, I've heard a colleague talking about
[01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:27.820]   how bringing junk food or soda to work
[01:00:27.820 --> 01:00:29.200]   is like passive smoking.
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:30.480]   You're like, you're bringing something
[01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:32.100]   and that's gonna pollute other people's health
[01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:33.020]   and you shouldn't do it.
[01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:34.860]   So that's much more edgy
[01:00:34.860 --> 01:00:37.040]   and people will fight them on that.
[01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:40.340]   But the basic reality is, yeah,
[01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:42.400]   we're gonna eat the donuts if they're in front of us.
[01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:46.540]   And so it is much more considerate to bring a bowl of fruit.
[01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:47.580]   - I do love a good donut.
[01:00:47.580 --> 01:00:50.260]   - Oh, me too, that's my weakness.
[01:00:50.260 --> 01:00:51.780]   - A certain circuit in my brain.
[01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:52.940]   I'm glad you brought up smoking.
[01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:54.040]   I don't want to take us off topic,
[01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:56.780]   but as long as we're venturing into these general,
[01:00:56.780 --> 01:00:59.420]   or I should say more general and yet really important themes
[01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:01.980]   around public health and food.
[01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:04.640]   Yes, I learned something interesting about smoking
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:06.980]   and why so few people now smoke.
[01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:11.980]   I always thought that the campaigns around smoking
[01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:13.580]   and how terrible it is for us,
[01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:16.140]   showing pictures of lungs that are, you know,
[01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:18.900]   caked with all this tar and like, you know, cancer
[01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:21.620]   and all this stuff was the effective message.
[01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:23.260]   But what I learned was that
[01:01:23.260 --> 01:01:25.660]   one of the most effective messaging systems
[01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:28.380]   in the battle against smoking
[01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:31.180]   was to get young people to stop smoking,
[01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:33.460]   not by telling them it was bad for them,
[01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:38.460]   but by showing them videos of these rich men
[01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:40.100]   sitting around tables,
[01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:42.660]   cackling about the fact that they're making so much money
[01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:45.220]   on the health problems of other people because of smoking.
[01:01:45.220 --> 01:01:47.220]   In other words, what they did is they made
[01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:50.780]   being a non-smoker anti-establishment.
[01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:52.060]   And so I find it very interesting
[01:01:52.060 --> 01:01:54.420]   anytime there's something like soda
[01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:55.720]   or highly processed foods
[01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:57.960]   that are so woven into the establishment,
[01:01:57.960 --> 01:02:00.900]   it seems like we can tell people
[01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:03.660]   until we're blue in the face
[01:02:03.660 --> 01:02:06.580]   about all the health concerns with these things.
[01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:08.220]   You know, sugar is bad and this is bad.
[01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:09.620]   Highly processed food is bad.
[01:02:09.620 --> 01:02:11.260]   Some people might change their behavior,
[01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:13.260]   but it seems like for the younger generation,
[01:02:13.260 --> 01:02:14.340]   the thing that's most effective
[01:02:14.340 --> 01:02:16.500]   is to activate their sense of rebellion.
[01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:18.060]   This has been true for probably
[01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:19.240]   hundreds of thousands of years,
[01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:21.640]   but it's certainly true in the last hundred years.
[01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:26.640]   And let them see that there is a very strong big food,
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:29.900]   sometimes big pharma, but certainly big food system
[01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:31.440]   that is working against them.
[01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:34.200]   And that in order to take control of their health,
[01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:36.720]   actually we want to activate their sense of rebellion
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:37.560]   so that they're like,
[01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:39.220]   no, I'm going to take excellent care of myself.
[01:02:39.220 --> 01:02:41.460]   I'm not going to fall victim to this monetary scheme.
[01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:43.420]   And here, I'm not pointing to any conspiracy.
[01:02:43.420 --> 01:02:44.700]   I mean, this has been seen with smoking.
[01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:46.940]   This has been seen with a number of different pharmaceuticals.
[01:02:46.940 --> 01:02:48.980]   Again, not all pharmaceuticals are bad.
[01:02:48.980 --> 01:02:51.500]   This is true of a number of different aspects
[01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:53.500]   of kind of big marketing.
[01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:55.500]   - Absolutely, it's like pull the blinders off,
[01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:59.340]   let people know that we're vulnerable to all the marketing
[01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:02.340]   and that there really are suppression of data
[01:03:02.340 --> 01:03:03.180]   behind a lot of it.
[01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:07.140]   So it's happening with eating disorders too.
[01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:09.320]   Eric Stice, who's at Stanford with you,
[01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:12.980]   has been using this method, we call it dissonance,
[01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:16.100]   showing people with eating disorders
[01:03:16.100 --> 01:03:18.340]   how the food industry has been manipulative
[01:03:18.340 --> 01:03:22.660]   and has tried to design foods for addiction
[01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:26.200]   for the highest bang for the buck with dopamine, et cetera.
[01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:29.340]   And so that has helped reduce eating disorders
[01:03:29.340 --> 01:03:30.660]   in these studies.
[01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:34.220]   And it has even helped reduce reward drive.
[01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:37.260]   Isn't that amazing that the dissonance could do that?
[01:03:37.260 --> 01:03:38.360]   - So interesting.
[01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:40.460]   Yeah, I think what it's telling us is that
[01:03:40.460 --> 01:03:45.140]   few things are as strong as the no, I won't,
[01:03:45.140 --> 01:03:48.800]   I refuse to your response in terms of changing behavior,
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:50.920]   especially when there's something to push against.
[01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:52.540]   So it's not just a battle with ourselves.
[01:03:52.540 --> 01:03:54.780]   I want the soda, but I'm not going to drink it.
[01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:57.040]   It becomes a, well, I want it, but I want it
[01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:58.920]   because you are making me think I want it.
[01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:00.420]   I don't actually want that.
[01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:03.000]   So I don't know, maybe this is getting me back
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.780]   into my teenage mindset, but I think a sense of rebellion,
[01:04:05.780 --> 01:04:08.060]   provided it's in the direction of health,
[01:04:08.060 --> 01:04:10.640]   one's own health and the health of others, of course,
[01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:11.680]   can be a positive thing.
[01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:13.640]   - Yeah, well, we do that with the mindful eating.
[01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:16.240]   We really, we have them bring in the junkiest processed food
[01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:17.980]   they can think of, like a Twinkie,
[01:04:17.980 --> 01:04:21.880]   and eat that really slowly and mindfully.
[01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:23.740]   And few people finish it and they're like,
[01:04:23.740 --> 01:04:26.400]   that actually wasn't nearly as good as the picture of it
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:27.520]   and the idea of it.
[01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:30.960]   And so it's like that reward predictive error
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:35.140]   that you've talked about where they think the brain
[01:04:35.140 --> 01:04:37.800]   is driving them to have it because of the advertising
[01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:40.240]   and their expectation that they'll feel good.
[01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:42.320]   But if they're really paying attention,
[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:45.480]   it's a very disappointing experience.
[01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:48.860]   Versus we also have people savor a piece of good chocolate,
[01:04:48.860 --> 01:04:50.400]   whichever they like, milk or dark.
[01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:54.620]   And that experience teaches them to eat slowly
[01:04:54.620 --> 01:04:58.460]   and really enjoy small amounts of rewarding food
[01:04:58.460 --> 01:05:01.620]   so that they're not, they don't need to feel full and binge.
[01:05:01.620 --> 01:05:02.820]   - Oh, so interesting.
[01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:05.340]   Dark or milk chocolate?
[01:05:05.340 --> 01:05:07.420]   - Dark. - Yeah, likewise.
[01:05:07.420 --> 01:05:09.220]   I actually like the 100% chocolate.
[01:05:09.220 --> 01:05:12.300]   There's one brand of Venezuelan chocolate that's 100%,
[01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:13.880]   which sounds, it might sound awful,
[01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:16.160]   but it's actually quite good.
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:18.240]   I think that was the first time I could actually taste
[01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:20.320]   the real elements of chocolate.
[01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:22.200]   - Interesting, yeah, that is not rewarding.
[01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:23.120]   It's way too bitter for me.
[01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:26.360]   I need the mouthfeel, you know, give me some fat in it.
[01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:29.700]   - Oh my, well, yeah, it's hard to find, but it's out there.
[01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:31.260]   I'd like to just take a brief moment
[01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:33.100]   and thank one of our podcast sponsors,
[01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:34.400]   which is InsideTracker.
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:37.060]   InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[01:05:37.060 --> 01:05:39.640]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:41.200]   to help you better understand your body
[01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:43.080]   and help you reach your health goals.
[01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:45.360]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:47.480]   for the simple reason that blood work
[01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:49.720]   is the only way that you can monitor the markers,
[01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:52.800]   such as hormone markers, lipids, metabolic factors, et cetera,
[01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:55.520]   that impact your immediate and long-term health.
[01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:57.640]   One major challenge with blood work, however,
[01:05:57.640 --> 01:05:59.160]   is that most of the time,
[01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:01.880]   it does not come back with any information about what to do
[01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:04.120]   in order to move the values for hormones,
[01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:05.980]   metabolic factors, lipids, et cetera,
[01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:07.420]   into the ranges that you want.
[01:06:07.420 --> 01:06:09.880]   With InsideTracker, changing those values
[01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:11.040]   becomes very straightforward
[01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:13.980]   because it has a personalized dashboard that you can use
[01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:17.000]   to address the nutrition-based, behavior-based,
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.760]   supplement-based approaches that you can use
[01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:21.900]   in order to move those values into the ranges
[01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:24.920]   that are optimal for you, your vitality, and your longevity.
[01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:26.660]   InsideTracker now includes a measurement
[01:06:26.660 --> 01:06:30.320]   of apolipoprotein B, so-called apoB, in their ultimate plan.
[01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:32.960]   ApoB is a key marker of cardiovascular health,
[01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:34.720]   and therefore, there's extreme value
[01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:36.720]   to knowing your apoB levels.
[01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:38.120]   If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
[01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:40.860]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman
[01:06:40.860 --> 01:06:43.200]   to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans.
[01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:46.080]   Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman
[01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:47.560]   to get 20% off.
[01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:51.880]   So while we're talking about stress, eating, obesity,
[01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:55.040]   and here, we've also broadened the discussion
[01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:56.400]   to include different generations.
[01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:58.440]   We're talking about teens and adults.
[01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:00.600]   I'd love for you to share with us your findings
[01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:04.040]   around this study that you did of pregnant women
[01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:09.040]   and how stress and pregnancy and different patterns of eating
[01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:11.840]   and physiological changes
[01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:14.440]   that people experience during pregnancy.
[01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:15.960]   Could you share with us what those findings were?
[01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:17.040]   Because I think those are relevant,
[01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:18.500]   not just to people who are pregnant
[01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:20.840]   or planning to become pregnant, but to everybody,
[01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:23.860]   'cause I think they shed light on how we manage stress
[01:07:23.860 --> 01:07:26.360]   and sometimes how we fail to manage stress.
[01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:29.160]   - Yeah, so with overweight and obesity,
[01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:32.060]   we know we can't just change calories.
[01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:33.220]   It's just not gonna work.
[01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:35.260]   The next stressful event's gonna come along,
[01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:38.340]   and people will go back to what their brain
[01:07:38.340 --> 01:07:41.320]   is driving them to do, is to binge on comfort food.
[01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:45.840]   And so we've done these interventions with men and women
[01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:48.120]   that show that we can help them regulate
[01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:52.020]   using some of these mindful eating strategies, checking in.
[01:07:52.020 --> 01:07:54.900]   We wanted to do this with pregnant women
[01:07:54.900 --> 01:07:58.320]   because when you have excess weight and you're pregnant,
[01:07:58.320 --> 01:07:59.320]   you're really vulnerable
[01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:01.920]   to gaining excessive weight during pregnancy,
[01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:05.480]   which is not healthy for the mom or the offspring.
[01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:08.080]   So we did this study.
[01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:12.240]   It took us probably 10 years total to get the grant
[01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:16.320]   and recruit groups of 10 women
[01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:18.360]   who are pregnant in the same stage
[01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:21.400]   and give them this training in mindful eating,
[01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:23.840]   mindful nutrition, and stress reduction.
[01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:26.560]   And then my colleague, Nikki Bush,
[01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:29.600]   has been following the babies for,
[01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:32.360]   I think it's been almost 10 years since then.
[01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:34.680]   And here's what we found.
[01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:37.960]   First of all, we couldn't stop excess weight gain.
[01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:41.200]   The women in the control group gained about,
[01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:43.520]   about 60% of them gained excess weight during pregnancy
[01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:44.960]   and same with our mindful group.
[01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:46.680]   So maybe it's end of story,
[01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:49.000]   you'd stop there and say it fails, don't do it.
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.440]   There have been so many beautiful developments
[01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:54.640]   in the women who got the training
[01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:57.840]   that we just keep being shocked
[01:08:57.840 --> 01:09:01.240]   by how impactful this stress reduction training was.
[01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:02.860]   It was just two months of their life,
[01:09:02.860 --> 01:09:06.060]   but pregnancy is a very critical period
[01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:09.640]   when these women were changing their habits
[01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:11.740]   and they're very motivated to help their baby.
[01:09:11.740 --> 01:09:13.640]   So here's what we found.
[01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:15.680]   Within that first month of the intervention,
[01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:17.600]   they all got this oral glucose tolerance test.
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:19.240]   So they all got, they got a blood test
[01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:24.240]   to see how well their body was metabolizing food, sugar.
[01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:26.840]   And so it's like a pre-diabetes test.
[01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:29.680]   And what we found was that twice as many women
[01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:32.020]   in the no treatment control group
[01:09:32.020 --> 01:09:34.440]   had impaired glucose tolerance during pregnancy.
[01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:37.200]   It's a common high risk.
[01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:42.200]   And half that many women had this in the mindfulness group.
[01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:44.400]   So by reducing stress,
[01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:47.800]   they improved their insulin sensitivity during pregnancy.
[01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:51.040]   So imagine what that's doing to the baby too.
[01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:55.360]   Then the babies have come out with less obesity,
[01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:58.780]   less illnesses in their first year of life,
[01:09:58.780 --> 01:10:02.000]   and more of this kind of healthy stress response
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.860]   when they've been stressed out in the lab study.
[01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:08.400]   And so then eight years later,
[01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:10.240]   we looked at the mental health of the mom.
[01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:12.360]   So right after the intervention, eight weeks later,
[01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:14.740]   everyone in our mindfulness stress direction group
[01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:15.580]   felt great.
[01:10:15.580 --> 01:10:16.640]   They felt less depressed.
[01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:18.660]   They had less stress and less anxiety.
[01:10:18.660 --> 01:10:19.660]   That's what you'd expect, right?
[01:10:19.660 --> 01:10:21.260]   I mean, they'd just gone to a weekly class.
[01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:22.880]   They got all this support.
[01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:24.000]   But eight years later,
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.100]   they still showed improved mental health.
[01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:31.280]   Every year that we measured them, they still looked better.
[01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:34.340]   So it's probably one of the longest studies
[01:10:34.340 --> 01:10:36.960]   looking at long-term effects of a mindfulness training.
[01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:38.680]   And I don't think it was a coincidence
[01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:39.620]   that it was during pregnancy.
[01:10:39.620 --> 01:10:43.200]   I think this is a very important time to have these skills.
[01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:46.640]   And being in a group adds that social support piece
[01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:48.400]   that we know is powerful.
[01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:49.840]   - That's an incredible result.
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:50.680]   Could you share with us
[01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:53.000]   what the mindfulness intervention was
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.300]   and when it was initiated, when it was stopped?
[01:10:55.300 --> 01:10:58.040]   So we're talking about 10 minutes a day of meditation,
[01:10:58.040 --> 01:10:59.880]   as many details as you can possibly give us,
[01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:01.320]   because I know,
[01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:03.560]   even though I don't think I'll ever be pregnant,
[01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:04.580]   I don't plan on it.
[01:11:04.580 --> 01:11:06.620]   - You never know.
[01:11:06.620 --> 01:11:07.940]   - Well, yeah.
[01:11:07.940 --> 01:11:12.400]   Zero minus one probability in my mind,
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:14.740]   but anyway, maybe other people have other ideas for me,
[01:11:14.740 --> 01:11:17.680]   but zero minus one probability in my mind.
[01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:20.440]   And yet I'm very interested
[01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:23.340]   in this mindfulness intervention
[01:11:23.340 --> 01:11:25.620]   because it sounds like a very potent one.
[01:11:25.620 --> 01:11:28.880]   So much so that it's having a multi-generational impact.
[01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:33.360]   So how many minutes a day, how many days per week?
[01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:36.080]   We had them, they met once a week.
[01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:37.440]   They had little reminder cards.
[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:39.880]   I mean, we need all the reminders we can.
[01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:42.800]   Post-its on the fridge, timers in our phone
[01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:44.760]   to do this mindful check-in.
[01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:48.560]   And so they were during the week doing this check-in
[01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:53.560]   and it was simply a mindful check-in closing their eyes
[01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:58.920]   and feeling their body, labeling their emotions.
[01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:01.080]   So it was mindful breathing.
[01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:03.160]   And then it was some movement.
[01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:05.680]   And we taught them prenatal yoga,
[01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:07.520]   but really any mind-body movement,
[01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:08.680]   people like different things.
[01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:13.680]   There's Qigong, there's even just slow walking
[01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:15.760]   would have worked.
[01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:20.760]   So it was mindful check-in, breathe, move my body.
[01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:24.340]   That's what the reminder card said.
[01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:29.340]   So close your eyes and look inside, do slow breathing.
[01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:30.880]   They also put their hands on their belly.
[01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:34.800]   And so they felt that they were taking care of their baby
[01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:36.760]   and then more movement.
[01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:39.580]   So they did increase their walking.
[01:12:39.580 --> 01:12:43.840]   And the mindful of check-ins are,
[01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:46.180]   as we were talking about at the very beginning,
[01:12:46.180 --> 01:12:48.400]   I would say necessary, but not sufficient.
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:50.460]   We've got to stop during the day
[01:12:50.460 --> 01:12:52.080]   and check in and look inside.
[01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:54.560]   If we're not aware of where our mind is,
[01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:58.820]   we are just subject to believing the stressful thoughts,
[01:12:58.820 --> 01:13:00.720]   thinking that we need to keep ruminating.
[01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:02.240]   They're sticky thoughts.
[01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:04.560]   So the mindful check-in is really important.
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:07.480]   And then I think the breathing, as we've talked about,
[01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:10.760]   is probably the more direct way
[01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:13.760]   that they're influencing the prenatal environment,
[01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:17.240]   the uterine environment to reduce the stress
[01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:20.440]   that the baby's being exposed to.
[01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:23.280]   And the movement refocuses us from our mind
[01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:27.720]   and our ruminative thoughts to the experiences,
[01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:29.200]   to what we feel in the body.
[01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:31.680]   There's even been a study that showed
[01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:34.440]   that overweight people with a lot of cravings,
[01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:36.080]   if they do the body scan,
[01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:39.640]   that's simply focusing on the body from the head to the toe,
[01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:43.680]   just reminding ourselves to focus on each part of the body,
[01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:45.600]   breathe into it, release tension.
[01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:47.340]   It's very basic and simple.
[01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:51.620]   The body scan significantly reduced cravings.
[01:13:51.620 --> 01:13:55.240]   I mean, to me, it's really hard to reduce cravings.
[01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:58.920]   So just that refocusing on the body
[01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:02.180]   took away stress, anxieties, self-referential thoughts,
[01:14:02.180 --> 01:14:05.160]   that kind of our favorite topic, thinking about ourself,
[01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:07.040]   thinking negative thoughts about ourself,
[01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:10.620]   to relaxing, feeling ease, feeling wellbeing.
[01:14:10.620 --> 01:14:14.160]   - I can't help but ask about what that body scan
[01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:15.640]   might've been doing at a little bit more
[01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:17.840]   of a mechanistic level.
[01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:20.260]   Some of the listeners might be familiar with these terms,
[01:14:20.260 --> 01:14:23.560]   but some won't, so I'll just briefly define them.
[01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:26.600]   We can perceive things in terms of exteroception
[01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:28.360]   or basically paying attention to
[01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:30.720]   and focusing on things beyond the confines of our skin
[01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:31.820]   or interoception.
[01:14:31.820 --> 01:14:34.920]   I realize you know all this, but for their sake-
[01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:37.240]   - No one really understands interoception, go for it.
[01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:40.600]   - So an interoception, essentially the sensory innervation
[01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:43.400]   of the internal organs, of our own skin,
[01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:46.100]   that includes proprioception, which is our knowledge
[01:14:46.100 --> 01:14:47.600]   or our sense of where our limbs are,
[01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:50.360]   where we are relative to gravity, all that stuff.
[01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:54.240]   And it raises this body scan result,
[01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:58.560]   that is the fact that a brief body scan can reduce cravings,
[01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:00.600]   raises this question in my mind, which is,
[01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:04.160]   is craving a heightened sense of interoception
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:05.760]   or heightened sense of exteroception?
[01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:07.720]   So I could think of one form of craving where,
[01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:10.620]   for instance, the donut, again, donuts for me,
[01:15:10.620 --> 01:15:13.520]   is in front of me and I'm thinking that, I want that.
[01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:16.080]   And so I'm almost in complete exteroception,
[01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:17.120]   but I'm tethered to it.
[01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:20.160]   Like my internal world is tethered to the donut.
[01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:23.520]   It's almost like the donut is in control of me briefly.
[01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:25.460]   Okay, and then I eat it.
[01:15:25.460 --> 01:15:27.120]   But if I-- - It's hijacked
[01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:28.440]   your prefrontal cortex.
[01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:30.240]   - It's hijacked everything, yeah.
[01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:33.080]   And then if I do a body scan, so I'm putting myself
[01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:37.240]   in this experiment and it's kind of a hypothetical scenario,
[01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:38.320]   I'm putting myself into this experiment.
[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:43.320]   I do a body scan, which without question is shifting me
[01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:45.480]   more towards interoception, right?
[01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:47.840]   I'm focusing on my skin, my heart rate, all these things,
[01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:50.160]   interoception, so I could see how that would draw
[01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:53.000]   my attention off of the external stimulus
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:54.600]   and reduce craving.
[01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:57.480]   And that makes me wonder whether or not craving
[01:15:57.480 --> 01:16:02.480]   is a form of exteroception where our interoception
[01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:07.480]   is just exquisitely locked to exteroception.
[01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:10.440]   And if so, 'cause I do think this is a remarkable result.
[01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:11.920]   It is very hard to stop cravings.
[01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:14.600]   I mean, we had a guest on here, a former colleague of mine
[01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:16.680]   at Stanford who's now the chair of neurosurgery
[01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:20.660]   at UPenn School of Medicine, which is Casey Halpern.
[01:16:20.660 --> 01:16:23.780]   I mean, they literally drill down through the skull
[01:16:23.780 --> 01:16:25.340]   of people who have binge eating disorder
[01:16:25.340 --> 01:16:27.640]   and start stimulating different brain areas
[01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:29.380]   because these people are so out of control
[01:16:29.380 --> 01:16:30.260]   in terms of their binge eating.
[01:16:30.260 --> 01:16:31.700]   I mean, that's the kind of intervention
[01:16:31.700 --> 01:16:34.500]   that is considered necessary for a lot of folks
[01:16:34.500 --> 01:16:35.660]   who binge eat.
[01:16:35.660 --> 01:16:38.820]   So here you're telling me a body scan in some individuals
[01:16:38.820 --> 01:16:40.700]   can reduce that, and I have to wonder whether or not
[01:16:40.700 --> 01:16:43.580]   it's somehow breaking that interoceptive,
[01:16:43.580 --> 01:16:45.460]   exteroceptive tether.
[01:16:45.460 --> 01:16:47.940]   Anyway, I'm speculating here, but I'd love your thoughts
[01:16:47.940 --> 01:16:51.620]   on craving and binging and breaking binging.
[01:16:51.620 --> 01:16:56.340]   Do you think that there are behavioral interventions
[01:16:56.340 --> 01:16:58.620]   that could be layered on top of body scans?
[01:16:58.620 --> 01:17:01.060]   Should we all be doing body scans routinely?
[01:17:01.060 --> 01:17:02.580]   - Yes, why not?
[01:17:02.580 --> 01:17:04.040]   And some people aren't going to like that.
[01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:07.040]   Lying down is maybe not comfortable.
[01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:10.340]   And so any mind-body activity is going to do the same.
[01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:13.940]   It's going to be, I think, breaking that link
[01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:14.980]   that you talked about.
[01:17:14.980 --> 01:17:17.940]   - Yeah, I find this whole interoceptive, exteroceptive
[01:17:17.940 --> 01:17:21.180]   balance thing, one of the more interesting conversations
[01:17:21.180 --> 01:17:23.660]   these days in neuroscience, because we're finally
[01:17:23.660 --> 01:17:25.980]   starting to understand what some of the circuitries are,
[01:17:25.980 --> 01:17:28.340]   and they do link to these reward pathways.
[01:17:28.340 --> 01:17:30.940]   In any event, getting back to the relationship
[01:17:30.940 --> 01:17:33.740]   between stress and food, and maybe even just weaving back
[01:17:33.740 --> 01:17:36.160]   a little bit to the opioid system,
[01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:41.700]   have there been any long-term studies of stress intervention?
[01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:43.460]   You know, in the studies that we do in our laboratory,
[01:17:43.460 --> 01:17:45.800]   we get people for a month, they do one intervention,
[01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:47.400]   we swap them to another intervention,
[01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:49.240]   and in a month, we analyze data.
[01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:50.700]   It takes a couple of years to do all that,
[01:17:50.700 --> 01:17:52.960]   but we write papers and we move on.
[01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:55.860]   Sounds like your laboratory has been involved
[01:17:55.860 --> 01:17:58.100]   in doing a lot of studies where you're examining people
[01:17:58.100 --> 01:18:00.660]   over a very long period of time, even their children.
[01:18:00.660 --> 01:18:04.060]   What can we learn about the long-term outcomes
[01:18:04.060 --> 01:18:06.100]   of things like body scans, meditation,
[01:18:06.100 --> 01:18:08.500]   and then we'll get into breath work?
[01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:11.940]   - There haven't been that many long-term studies
[01:18:11.940 --> 01:18:14.540]   of stress interventions.
[01:18:14.540 --> 01:18:17.120]   Now that you mention it, I think the meditation studies
[01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:19.100]   are probably the best example.
[01:18:19.100 --> 01:18:22.740]   There are some studies that have either followed people
[01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:25.580]   who have taken up meditation,
[01:18:25.580 --> 01:18:27.100]   or just these cross-sectional studies
[01:18:27.100 --> 01:18:29.360]   where you compare a long-term meditator
[01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:31.520]   to someone who's never meditated.
[01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:33.840]   And they are interesting.
[01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:36.540]   I mean, let's talk about the cross-sectional studies.
[01:18:36.540 --> 01:18:40.140]   You're already studying someone who eats like kale chips
[01:18:40.140 --> 01:18:40.980]   instead of potato chips.
[01:18:40.980 --> 01:18:42.020]   So there's a lot of differences
[01:18:42.020 --> 01:18:44.040]   in who decides to be a meditator.
[01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:49.660]   In terms of the health and biology,
[01:18:49.660 --> 01:18:53.660]   we have found that there is slower biological aging,
[01:18:53.660 --> 01:18:55.840]   and other people have found that.
[01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:57.640]   In these meditation interventions we do,
[01:18:57.640 --> 01:18:59.380]   the short-term ones,
[01:18:59.380 --> 01:19:03.180]   the inflammatory pathways of gene expression
[01:19:03.180 --> 01:19:05.440]   are dampened way down.
[01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:08.660]   And cross-sectionally, other people like Elizabeth Hoggi
[01:19:08.660 --> 01:19:11.220]   have found longer telomeres in the meditators
[01:19:11.220 --> 01:19:13.420]   versus the controls.
[01:19:13.420 --> 01:19:16.260]   So we haven't really found telomere lengthening
[01:19:16.260 --> 01:19:18.340]   in our short-term meditation studies,
[01:19:18.340 --> 01:19:22.420]   but we do find boosts in telomerase activity,
[01:19:22.420 --> 01:19:25.340]   which is this enzyme that protects our cell aging,
[01:19:25.340 --> 01:19:28.660]   slows our cell aging, rebuilds the telomeres.
[01:19:28.660 --> 01:19:33.620]   So those are studies that suggest
[01:19:33.620 --> 01:19:35.840]   if someone were to continue meditating,
[01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:39.000]   they might keep up that slower rate of aging.
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:40.920]   So there's one study we did,
[01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:44.720]   which I think was particularly fun.
[01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:47.800]   We went to a retreat center where Deepak Chopra
[01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:50.820]   leads this one-week transcendental meditation retreat.
[01:19:50.820 --> 01:19:53.860]   So people got a mantra and they were focusing
[01:19:53.860 --> 01:19:58.520]   for probably eight hours a day on different yoga,
[01:19:58.520 --> 01:20:01.000]   meditation, and reflective exercises.
[01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:05.980]   And then we had half the group just walk around the resort,
[01:20:05.980 --> 01:20:09.460]   take walks, hear some boring health talks.
[01:20:09.460 --> 01:20:11.220]   So that was our control group.
[01:20:11.220 --> 01:20:13.140]   And what we found from that study
[01:20:13.140 --> 01:20:16.740]   was that in the short run, a week later,
[01:20:16.740 --> 01:20:20.020]   everyone felt fantastic after the week, right?
[01:20:20.020 --> 01:20:22.100]   They weren't allowed to bring their laptop and work,
[01:20:22.100 --> 01:20:25.660]   and they ate this great anti-inflammatory diet,
[01:20:25.660 --> 01:20:27.100]   an Ayurvedic diet.
[01:20:27.100 --> 01:20:29.020]   And then the gene expression pathways
[01:20:29.020 --> 01:20:32.260]   were like night and day from day one to the last day.
[01:20:32.260 --> 01:20:36.280]   And our model of machine learning model
[01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:38.660]   was able to identify people over 90%.
[01:20:38.660 --> 01:20:41.440]   It could say whether they were on day one or day seven.
[01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:44.260]   And the difference really emerged over the long run.
[01:20:44.260 --> 01:20:47.780]   We went and we followed them about 10 months later,
[01:20:47.780 --> 01:20:51.340]   and we found that not everyone felt great.
[01:20:51.340 --> 01:20:54.780]   10 months later, the group who learned meditation
[01:20:54.780 --> 01:20:56.580]   still had lower depression,
[01:20:56.580 --> 01:20:59.100]   but the control group bounced right back up.
[01:20:59.100 --> 01:21:00.380]   And then we looked a little bit further
[01:21:00.380 --> 01:21:02.860]   and we saw that people with early adversity
[01:21:02.860 --> 01:21:06.140]   benefited the most from the meditation condition.
[01:21:06.140 --> 01:21:08.940]   - Oh, what was the meditation condition?
[01:21:08.940 --> 01:21:10.460]   How long per day?
[01:21:10.460 --> 01:21:12.340]   - Yeah, well, so they did,
[01:21:12.340 --> 01:21:15.940]   they learned transcendental, primordial sound meditation,
[01:21:15.940 --> 01:21:17.220]   which is similar to TM,
[01:21:17.220 --> 01:21:22.220]   where you have a focused attention on a word over and over,
[01:21:22.300 --> 01:21:26.700]   but there's also more awareness of the body.
[01:21:26.700 --> 01:21:31.560]   And that was, I couldn't say how many minutes a day,
[01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:34.340]   but it was on and off during the day.
[01:21:34.340 --> 01:21:35.840]   - Okay, so repeatedly,
[01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:38.420]   but for a fairly short period of time, one week.
[01:21:38.420 --> 01:21:39.740]   - Yeah, right.
[01:21:39.740 --> 01:21:40.580]   - Yeah, I've never done
[01:21:40.580 --> 01:21:42.340]   one of these extended meditation retreats.
[01:21:42.340 --> 01:21:43.420]   - Are you interested?
[01:21:43.420 --> 01:21:44.920]   - Well, various people in my life have told me
[01:21:44.920 --> 01:21:46.920]   that I needed to go do a silent meditation,
[01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:49.420]   but they probably were emphasizing the silent part.
[01:21:51.140 --> 01:21:52.420]   I recommend them.
[01:21:52.420 --> 01:21:55.240]   I think there are amazing ways to get to know the mind
[01:21:55.240 --> 01:22:00.240]   and to really calm the body in ways like a quantum shift
[01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:03.700]   in our level of stress that we don't get.
[01:22:03.700 --> 01:22:06.100]   It's very hard to get in short balance.
[01:22:06.100 --> 01:22:08.060]   - I do a daily meditation practice,
[01:22:08.060 --> 01:22:10.040]   but it's a relatively brief meditation practice.
[01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:12.380]   I do tend to focus more on things like deliberate
[01:22:12.380 --> 01:22:15.780]   cold exposure and breath work and exercise and sunlight
[01:22:15.780 --> 01:22:17.620]   and all the things I talk about on the podcast.
[01:22:17.620 --> 01:22:21.780]   But I'm certainly not averse to doing a longer meditation.
[01:22:21.780 --> 01:22:25.420]   Are all of these TM meditations,
[01:22:25.420 --> 01:22:26.820]   are they silent meditations?
[01:22:26.820 --> 01:22:31.700]   And they range from what, two days to a week, is that?
[01:22:31.700 --> 01:22:34.180]   - Well, the retreats, you can always find a retreat
[01:22:34.180 --> 01:22:37.140]   that's half a day, one day, a week, two weeks.
[01:22:37.140 --> 01:22:39.900]   So you don't go right into a two week, you work up to it.
[01:22:39.900 --> 01:22:40.900]   So the longest I've ever done
[01:22:40.900 --> 01:22:44.520]   is a two week silent meditation retreat.
[01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:49.320]   And that was after 10 years of doing yearly shorter retreats.
[01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:52.960]   And then when you, I think it would be too hard
[01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:56.160]   and stressful if you haven't been able to,
[01:22:56.160 --> 01:22:57.320]   I mean, meditation would be stressful
[01:22:57.320 --> 01:22:59.380]   if you think that you're failing at it.
[01:22:59.380 --> 01:23:03.480]   And so you need to have kind of developed the skill
[01:23:03.480 --> 01:23:05.400]   a little bit before you go on the retreats.
[01:23:05.400 --> 01:23:07.920]   And so lots of classes can do that in online.
[01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:10.480]   But I think the short bouts every day are,
[01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:12.880]   that is what is the most important message for people,
[01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:14.520]   for managing daily stress.
[01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:16.760]   And that's in the stress prescription,
[01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:21.400]   it's very much about how we can do short daily nudges
[01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:23.480]   to reduce our stress arousal.
[01:23:23.480 --> 01:23:27.120]   So breathing is one of the best body-based examples
[01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:29.160]   of getting right there, but there are other ways.
[01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:33.000]   So being in nature, that's a really strong stimulus,
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:37.240]   an environment that sends all sorts of safety signals to us.
[01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:39.060]   - Yeah, certainly it's not an either or,
[01:23:39.060 --> 01:23:41.680]   but it seems like nowadays, a lot of the discussion
[01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:43.380]   that used to be had around meditation
[01:23:43.380 --> 01:23:45.640]   and its ability to evoke neuroplasticity
[01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:47.880]   and things of that sort has shifted over to
[01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:51.760]   an increased focus on psychedelics,
[01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:53.260]   is the common theme on this podcast.
[01:23:53.260 --> 01:23:56.720]   But it just seems like in taking the pulse of social media
[01:23:56.720 --> 01:23:57.560]   and the landscape out there,
[01:23:57.560 --> 01:24:00.360]   there's so much excitement about psilocybin,
[01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:02.680]   both in microdose and macrodose and MDMA
[01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:05.720]   and some of the other trials that are out there,
[01:24:05.720 --> 01:24:08.760]   that many people are starting to forget
[01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:12.340]   the incredibly rich and vast literature supporting the use
[01:24:12.340 --> 01:24:15.680]   of even brief meditation practices for reshaping the mind.
[01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:17.840]   So I'm glad that we're talking about meditation.
[01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:22.620]   - But I mean, even going into plant medicine experiences
[01:24:22.620 --> 01:24:25.120]   is enhanced if you have a little bit of training
[01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:27.360]   in how to, in metacognition,
[01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:29.320]   how to view the mind and thoughts.
[01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:31.160]   You can observe the whole experience
[01:24:31.160 --> 01:24:35.020]   with that much more kind of calmness, skill and wisdom,
[01:24:35.020 --> 01:24:38.080]   knowing this is just the mind doing these cool things.
[01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:39.920]   So it's not, they're not separate.
[01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:42.800]   And then I think that the psilocybin experiences
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:44.960]   enhance daily meditation.
[01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:47.600]   So they really go well together.
[01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:52.560]   - Yeah, and then just as a little editorial on psychedelics,
[01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:55.100]   what's interesting, I think, about the clinical data
[01:24:55.100 --> 01:24:58.360]   is that we think of the psychedelic journey
[01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:00.560]   as the time in which all the changes occur
[01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:03.080]   because it has all these properties of hallucinations
[01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:04.600]   and altered thinking, et cetera,
[01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:07.080]   that acts as kind of a gravitational pull
[01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:10.040]   around our ideas about what psychedelics do.
[01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:12.920]   But it's actually in the window after the psychedelic journey
[01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:14.820]   that the actual rewiring of the brain takes place.
[01:25:14.820 --> 01:25:17.280]   So when people talk about integration afterwards,
[01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:19.140]   they're not just talking about the few hours
[01:25:19.140 --> 01:25:21.040]   where they're parachuting back down
[01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:25.820]   to typical consciousness, let's call it that,
[01:25:25.820 --> 01:25:27.020]   but that there's these long,
[01:25:27.020 --> 01:25:30.360]   perhaps even weeks or month long tail of plasticity.
[01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:32.680]   And that's actually when most of the rewiring is happening
[01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:34.720]   and which I find really interesting,
[01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:36.200]   which is not unlike meditation
[01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:38.080]   where, sure, in one bout of meditation,
[01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:40.640]   you might see an adjustment or rewiring of the brain,
[01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:43.120]   but at least from the book "Altered Traits,"
[01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:44.860]   which I'm a big fan of,
[01:25:44.860 --> 01:25:47.480]   talked about these daily repeated short meditations
[01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:51.340]   or these longer TM retreats, as they're sometimes called,
[01:25:51.340 --> 01:25:54.900]   in inducing this big-time brain plasticity.
[01:25:54.900 --> 01:25:56.920]   All right, well, now I'm going to have to do it,
[01:25:56.920 --> 01:25:59.360]   and I'll report back to everybody what my experience was,
[01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:00.960]   although I might do it silently.
[01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:03.640]   I'd love to talk a little bit
[01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:05.400]   about some of the other health metrics
[01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:06.320]   that you've explored,
[01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:08.360]   not just in the context of mindfulness,
[01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:12.720]   but I'm particularly intrigued by a graph here.
[01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:14.360]   I'm showing my really nerdy side.
[01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:15.880]   There's a graph in one of your papers.
[01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:18.040]   It's the Picard paper, 2018.
[01:26:18.040 --> 01:26:20.680]   We will provide a link to this in the show note captions
[01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:21.900]   if people want to take a look,
[01:26:21.900 --> 01:26:23.900]   but it essentially describes the relationship
[01:26:23.900 --> 01:26:26.800]   between mitochondrial health and mood
[01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:29.280]   in the context of people
[01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:32.080]   who have different type of mood tendencies.
[01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:35.120]   If you would be willing to just kind of describe
[01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:36.740]   the top contour of that study
[01:26:36.740 --> 01:26:39.800]   and some of the points that you find most interesting.
[01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:41.160]   I think it's a fascinating study,
[01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:42.960]   and I'm so glad you did it,
[01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:44.560]   but I'll let you tell us about it.
[01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:46.780]   - Yeah, we've done these in-depth studies
[01:26:46.780 --> 01:26:48.500]   where we are looking at people
[01:26:48.500 --> 01:26:51.200]   under a lot of daily demand, caregivers,
[01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:53.800]   and then we look at normal people,
[01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:56.040]   parents of neurotypical children
[01:26:56.040 --> 01:26:57.220]   who still have a lot of stress,
[01:26:57.220 --> 01:26:59.040]   but we then ask,
[01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:03.360]   do people under chronic stress have accelerated aging?
[01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:06.020]   So we look at telomeres, epigenetics, mitochondrial health,
[01:27:06.020 --> 01:27:09.800]   and then what explains those who look really good,
[01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:12.720]   who look resilient and don't look vulnerable?
[01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:14.040]   And so then we can find out like,
[01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:15.600]   what's the magic sauce in the day
[01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:17.520]   that protects them from chronic stress?
[01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:21.640]   So Martin Picard, my colleague who has been obsessed
[01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:24.960]   with mitochondrial health as a pathway
[01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:29.040]   to understanding both stress and really health and disease,
[01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:31.600]   he has developed a way to measure
[01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:33.640]   the mitochondrial health in humans.
[01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:36.040]   So we can measure a bunch of enzymes
[01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:38.560]   and then we can adjust it for how many mitochondria we have.
[01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:40.520]   So we have this really nice index
[01:27:40.520 --> 01:27:42.680]   we can get from the blood.
[01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:47.160]   And in this study of young mothers
[01:27:47.160 --> 01:27:51.720]   who had either typical children or children with autism,
[01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:55.280]   we found that the caregiving moms
[01:27:55.280 --> 01:28:00.280]   had significantly lower or dampened mitochondrial activity.
[01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:05.640]   What that means is they can't produce as much energy.
[01:28:05.640 --> 01:28:08.560]   So if they're feeling more exhausted
[01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:10.760]   from the chronic stress, we know why.
[01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:13.600]   I mean, it really is a, it was quite dramatic.
[01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:16.040]   Martin commented some of those low levels
[01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:18.680]   even looked like people with some genetic reasons
[01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:21.400]   to have low mitochondrial activity.
[01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:23.080]   But here's the beauty of that study.
[01:28:23.080 --> 01:28:26.800]   We then get to look within their day at their mood
[01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:28.800]   and ask, well, what about the caregivers
[01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:32.640]   who have really great mitochondrial enzymes
[01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:36.240]   and thus should be making a lot of ATP?
[01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:38.840]   They had more positive emotions,
[01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:40.800]   both waking up and in the evening,
[01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:42.600]   but especially in the evening.
[01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:43.960]   And what's so interesting in that
[01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:48.320]   is all of these daily diary studies of stress and mood.
[01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:52.440]   One of the things we know that matters for long-term health
[01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:55.800]   is how positive you feel at night.
[01:28:55.800 --> 01:28:57.400]   So especially on a stressful day.
[01:28:57.400 --> 01:28:59.120]   So at the end of a stressful day,
[01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:02.480]   can you muster some feelings of content,
[01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:04.920]   ease, confidence, joy?
[01:29:04.920 --> 01:29:05.960]   Do you have any of that?
[01:29:05.960 --> 01:29:08.480]   Or has it just wiped out your positivity?
[01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:13.280]   And so for people who feel either lower negative
[01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:14.880]   or higher positive,
[01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:17.640]   they tend to have better health trajectories.
[01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:19.640]   So like a decade later, less depression,
[01:29:19.640 --> 01:29:22.400]   less heart disease, less early death.
[01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:25.320]   So that's why we care so much about daily moods.
[01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:28.480]   And in our study, it looks like the daily mood
[01:29:28.480 --> 01:29:31.840]   was really quite correlated with the mitochondria levels
[01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:33.040]   that same day.
[01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:36.000]   And we measured mood like days away from that,
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:37.520]   it was much less correlated.
[01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:39.800]   So that's just our first study on this,
[01:29:39.800 --> 01:29:42.960]   but it really leads us to think that our mitochondria
[01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:47.000]   are sensitive to our thoughts and our feelings,
[01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.520]   probably on a daily basis.
[01:29:49.520 --> 01:29:50.680]   - Incredible.
[01:29:50.680 --> 01:29:53.680]   So for those of us that find ourselves in it
[01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:56.320]   in a state of chronic stress,
[01:29:56.320 --> 01:29:57.840]   and here I'm talking about the kind of stress
[01:29:57.840 --> 01:29:59.240]   that you mentioned before,
[01:29:59.240 --> 01:30:04.240]   which is there is unlikely to be a simple solution.
[01:30:04.240 --> 01:30:06.960]   Like we're just going to be grappling with this thing.
[01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:09.680]   And you mentioned the words radical acceptance,
[01:30:09.680 --> 01:30:12.320]   which I'd like to drill into a little bit too.
[01:30:12.320 --> 01:30:14.760]   'Cause this is a theme in the self-help literature.
[01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:16.880]   And it's a theme in that now I think
[01:30:16.880 --> 01:30:19.520]   in the formal psychology literature,
[01:30:19.520 --> 01:30:24.520]   I actually was talking to a dialectical psychology expert
[01:30:24.520 --> 01:30:27.840]   recently, I think that's the correct title.
[01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:30.200]   - Dialectical behavioral therapy?
[01:30:30.200 --> 01:30:31.040]   - Correct, yeah.
[01:30:31.040 --> 01:30:32.920]   - That's a common, great one.
[01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:34.360]   - Yeah, you're correct.
[01:30:34.360 --> 01:30:37.240]   I was grasping and that's correct.
[01:30:37.240 --> 01:30:40.400]   And they were talking about some of the misconceptions
[01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:42.320]   about radical acceptance,
[01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:44.440]   because I think a lot of people hear the words
[01:30:44.440 --> 01:30:46.740]   radical acceptance, at least this is what they told me
[01:30:46.740 --> 01:30:49.120]   and think, oh, that means that you have to just accept
[01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:50.800]   what is and deal with it.
[01:30:50.800 --> 01:30:52.420]   There's another form of radical acceptance,
[01:30:52.420 --> 01:30:54.160]   which is I radically accept the fact
[01:30:54.160 --> 01:30:55.960]   that I'm not going to deal with this, right?
[01:30:55.960 --> 01:30:57.320]   I'm going to walk away from it.
[01:30:57.320 --> 01:30:59.800]   But what you're talking about is chronic stress
[01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:03.280]   of the sort that really the stressor,
[01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:08.160]   the fact that a very close relative or family member
[01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:10.880]   is dealing with a lifelong condition,
[01:31:10.880 --> 01:31:14.840]   or the fact that we can't extract ourselves
[01:31:14.840 --> 01:31:17.880]   from a situation, that we are not in full agency
[01:31:17.880 --> 01:31:19.520]   to remove the stressor,
[01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:24.240]   that radical acceptance of that fact
[01:31:24.240 --> 01:31:28.620]   then can ratchet into an understanding of, okay,
[01:31:28.620 --> 01:31:30.360]   and yet there are tools that we can use
[01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:32.360]   to not just offset the negative health effects,
[01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:34.760]   but maybe even thrive in the context of this,
[01:31:34.760 --> 01:31:37.120]   essentially turning what initially was thought of
[01:31:37.120 --> 01:31:38.520]   as a curse into a blessing,
[01:31:38.520 --> 01:31:40.080]   at least biologically speaking.
[01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:45.200]   What are the data around the practices
[01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:49.240]   that can help make that conversion possible?
[01:31:49.240 --> 01:31:50.940]   I realize there's a lot of psychological work
[01:31:50.940 --> 01:31:51.780]   that needs to be done.
[01:31:51.780 --> 01:31:55.840]   Ongoing people need coping mechanisms, support groups.
[01:31:55.840 --> 01:31:57.400]   Always better to have more social support
[01:31:57.400 --> 01:31:58.900]   than less, of course.
[01:31:58.900 --> 01:32:03.080]   But are we, again, talking about
[01:32:03.080 --> 01:32:05.480]   a daily mindfulness practice,
[01:32:05.480 --> 01:32:08.800]   or is it daily mindfulness of a certain type?
[01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:10.740]   What do we know about best practices
[01:32:10.740 --> 01:32:15.220]   for mitigating these essentially non-negotiable stressors?
[01:32:15.220 --> 01:32:22.300]   - It's a great question, and it's not a quick answer.
[01:32:22.300 --> 01:32:25.540]   I think it is partly how we view life
[01:32:25.540 --> 01:32:29.660]   and our purpose in our own life.
[01:32:29.660 --> 01:32:32.840]   What's this game that we were born into?
[01:32:32.840 --> 01:32:35.800]   And even just the idea that bad things shouldn't happen
[01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:39.100]   sets us up for vulnerability to feel victimized,
[01:32:39.100 --> 01:32:44.100]   to feel like we can't accept bad things that have happened.
[01:32:44.100 --> 01:32:49.820]   So just stepping back and asking everyone listening,
[01:32:49.820 --> 01:32:53.480]   do you have a situation in your life
[01:32:53.480 --> 01:32:56.820]   that is unwanted and you can't change?
[01:32:56.820 --> 01:33:01.080]   It could be small, it could be huge.
[01:33:01.080 --> 01:33:05.580]   How much time do you spend thinking about this?
[01:33:07.480 --> 01:33:12.400]   The more we spend time trying to problem solve or worry
[01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:14.740]   or just wishing things were different,
[01:33:14.740 --> 01:33:20.280]   the more we are creating a chronic stress state.
[01:33:20.280 --> 01:33:27.440]   And so just even taking that first kind of step back
[01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:30.520]   to get perspective on what are the situations in my life
[01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:34.480]   that stress me out and which of these can I circle those
[01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:36.500]   that I can't change?
[01:33:36.500 --> 01:33:38.840]   They're on my list, so they're on my mind.
[01:33:38.840 --> 01:33:40.600]   They're still upsetting.
[01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:42.220]   They haven't receded it in the background,
[01:33:42.220 --> 01:33:43.380]   they haven't gone away.
[01:33:43.380 --> 01:33:46.660]   Just that recognition of this isn't gonna go away
[01:33:46.660 --> 01:33:51.660]   is incredibly powerful because we can, as I say,
[01:33:51.660 --> 01:33:56.940]   put the baggage down and give ourselves some relief
[01:33:56.940 --> 01:34:01.000]   and some freedom from the big space it holds
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.180]   in our mind and in our body.
[01:34:03.180 --> 01:34:05.860]   And this is not a one-time thing, it's a practice.
[01:34:05.860 --> 01:34:09.220]   Radical acceptance is something we practice over and over
[01:34:09.220 --> 01:34:13.980]   to help us loosen our grip on unwanted situations,
[01:34:13.980 --> 01:34:17.040]   on letting them control our wellbeing
[01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:20.220]   and taking up this mental real estate
[01:34:20.220 --> 01:34:22.340]   that's so precious, our attention.
[01:34:22.340 --> 01:34:28.260]   So there are statements that we can say that help us
[01:34:28.260 --> 01:34:34.400]   and there are a few metaphors.
[01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:38.500]   So I'm an expert at this because I'm a caregiver
[01:34:38.500 --> 01:34:42.580]   and I often need to refocus
[01:34:42.580 --> 01:34:44.600]   from wishing things were different,
[01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:49.600]   trying to solve things to really radical acceptance
[01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:54.600]   of this is how things are right now, this is the reality.
[01:34:54.600 --> 01:35:00.140]   And by just reminding ourselves
[01:35:00.140 --> 01:35:01.940]   that there is freedom within that,
[01:35:01.940 --> 01:35:04.100]   that there are things that you can do,
[01:35:04.100 --> 01:35:06.800]   you can actually live better,
[01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:09.120]   live well with these situations.
[01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:11.400]   So let me tell you what we found from our caregivers.
[01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:13.640]   We measure where their mind is at night.
[01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:16.980]   We ping them and we say, in the last five minutes,
[01:35:16.980 --> 01:35:20.240]   how much have you been wishing things were different?
[01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:22.820]   How much have you been engaged and focused
[01:35:22.820 --> 01:35:26.160]   in what you're doing right before we pinged you?
[01:35:26.160 --> 01:35:30.820]   And just those two questions tell us so much
[01:35:30.820 --> 01:35:33.280]   about that person's wellbeing.
[01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:36.980]   So people, and actually, yes, the caregivers
[01:35:36.980 --> 01:35:40.980]   are doing more of what I'll call suffering,
[01:35:40.980 --> 01:35:42.520]   wishing things were different,
[01:35:42.520 --> 01:35:44.360]   not being present for their lives.
[01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:46.540]   But regardless of that difference,
[01:35:46.540 --> 01:35:48.940]   whether people are a caregiver or not,
[01:35:48.940 --> 01:35:51.040]   this negative mind-wandering state
[01:35:51.040 --> 01:35:54.700]   of not being present for your evening,
[01:35:54.700 --> 01:35:57.740]   wishing things were different instead of being engaged,
[01:35:57.740 --> 01:36:01.500]   predicts more unhappiness.
[01:36:01.500 --> 01:36:05.320]   It predicts shorter telomeres.
[01:36:05.320 --> 01:36:08.380]   So it suggests that it's a pattern
[01:36:08.380 --> 01:36:11.780]   that has gone on for days, months, and years
[01:36:11.780 --> 01:36:13.760]   that has been wearing on them.
[01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:17.080]   And so some of the metaphors
[01:36:17.080 --> 01:36:19.200]   that I think are helpful for this
[01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:21.640]   are thinking of yourself,
[01:36:21.640 --> 01:36:23.220]   think of this unwanted situation,
[01:36:23.220 --> 01:36:26.800]   and think of how you're pulling a rope
[01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:28.400]   that's attached to a brick wall.
[01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:33.140]   And you're doing that because you care.
[01:36:33.140 --> 01:36:36.140]   You want things to be better for yourself or this person
[01:36:36.140 --> 01:36:39.700]   or a group.
[01:36:39.700 --> 01:36:42.680]   I mean, it's something you're passionate about.
[01:36:42.680 --> 01:36:44.180]   And so you're pulling and pulling,
[01:36:44.180 --> 01:36:45.180]   and every day you're pulling.
[01:36:45.180 --> 01:36:47.540]   And you can't move that brick wall.
[01:36:47.540 --> 01:36:49.300]   So the only thing that's happening
[01:36:49.300 --> 01:36:51.180]   is that you're chafing your hands,
[01:36:51.180 --> 01:36:53.220]   that chronic tension.
[01:36:53.220 --> 01:36:57.180]   What if you just drop the rope?
[01:36:58.820 --> 01:37:02.260]   I say that to myself, "Drop the rope."
[01:37:02.260 --> 01:37:04.140]   When I start getting going
[01:37:04.140 --> 01:37:06.480]   on trying to solve unsolvable problems,
[01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:09.360]   the brick wall's still there, it's never gonna move,
[01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:11.240]   yet my hands are free.
[01:37:11.240 --> 01:37:15.500]   And so I can be freed up to live in the ways
[01:37:15.500 --> 01:37:17.180]   that I do have control over,
[01:37:17.180 --> 01:37:19.840]   to do things that help around the edges.
[01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:21.700]   So I was just talking with someone
[01:37:21.700 --> 01:37:25.040]   who's just so concerned about their aging parents
[01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:28.060]   and them not getting the care they need,
[01:37:28.060 --> 01:37:29.540]   not taking care of themselves.
[01:37:29.540 --> 01:37:31.060]   Things aren't going well.
[01:37:31.060 --> 01:37:33.620]   But there was so little that they could do
[01:37:33.620 --> 01:37:34.980]   to help their parents.
[01:37:34.980 --> 01:37:38.460]   And so by dropping the rope for them
[01:37:38.460 --> 01:37:41.260]   meant realizing there were things they could do,
[01:37:41.260 --> 01:37:43.180]   being present, being loving,
[01:37:43.180 --> 01:37:48.340]   doing the little bit of care that they could from a distance
[01:37:48.340 --> 01:37:49.680]   was all they could do.
[01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:51.220]   And that's enough.
[01:37:51.220 --> 01:37:54.620]   That loving presence is like a gift
[01:37:54.620 --> 01:37:58.400]   that we don't realize that we always have that to give.
[01:37:58.400 --> 01:38:00.740]   - Where do you think the tendency
[01:38:00.740 --> 01:38:03.620]   for us to try and pull on brick walls comes from?
[01:38:03.620 --> 01:38:05.760]   I mean, it's so non-adaptive.
[01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:10.740]   And I've also heard it stated that people do this
[01:38:10.740 --> 01:38:14.040]   in the reverse direction to, meaning in time,
[01:38:14.040 --> 01:38:18.020]   trying to control the past through current behaviors,
[01:38:18.020 --> 01:38:20.020]   as well as try and control the future.
[01:38:20.020 --> 01:38:23.020]   - So give me an example of that.
[01:38:23.020 --> 01:38:25.420]   - Yeah, this is something I learned from a guest we had
[01:38:25.420 --> 01:38:27.740]   on here, Dr. Paul Conte, he's a psychiatrist
[01:38:27.740 --> 01:38:30.100]   who, extremely skilled psychiatrist
[01:38:30.100 --> 01:38:31.220]   who wrote a book on trauma,
[01:38:31.220 --> 01:38:34.620]   which I think is the best book on trauma, frankly.
[01:38:34.620 --> 01:38:37.460]   And he talked about how the limbic system
[01:38:37.460 --> 01:38:40.540]   that engages these fight or flight responses
[01:38:40.540 --> 01:38:42.040]   has no sense of time.
[01:38:42.040 --> 01:38:45.720]   And that's why developmental scripts get reactivated,
[01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:50.720]   in particular parent-child or caretaker-child neural circuits
[01:38:51.700 --> 01:38:53.340]   that were engaged in those relationships
[01:38:53.340 --> 01:38:54.660]   when we were really young,
[01:38:54.660 --> 01:38:56.660]   get reactivated in adult relationships.
[01:38:56.660 --> 01:38:59.620]   I mean, in some sense, it doesn't make any sense,
[01:38:59.620 --> 01:39:01.480]   like why wouldn't the human mind have separate circuits
[01:39:01.480 --> 01:39:03.300]   for adult, like romantic attachment
[01:39:03.300 --> 01:39:04.640]   versus child-parent attachment?
[01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:05.900]   This is all sounding very Freudian,
[01:39:05.900 --> 01:39:08.680]   and yet when you look at the neural imaging,
[01:39:08.680 --> 01:39:10.500]   it's like you get one set of circuits
[01:39:10.500 --> 01:39:12.340]   for understanding of relationship.
[01:39:12.340 --> 01:39:13.880]   Of course, you adjust according to context
[01:39:13.880 --> 01:39:15.060]   and they get repurposed.
[01:39:15.060 --> 01:39:17.780]   You don't just set that aside, say that was for childhood.
[01:39:17.780 --> 01:39:20.540]   What he said was that the limbic system
[01:39:20.540 --> 01:39:24.860]   and the stress system, when it's activated,
[01:39:24.860 --> 01:39:27.460]   distorts our perception of time.
[01:39:27.460 --> 01:39:32.140]   And that this is what he was saying leads to the,
[01:39:32.140 --> 01:39:33.860]   what's sometimes called the repetition compulsion.
[01:39:33.860 --> 01:39:36.680]   People try and will repeat the same,
[01:39:36.680 --> 01:39:39.100]   place themselves into mildly
[01:39:39.100 --> 01:39:42.860]   to severely traumatic circumstances over and over again,
[01:39:42.860 --> 01:39:44.940]   despite the presence of a trauma.
[01:39:44.940 --> 01:39:46.180]   It doesn't have to be childhood trauma.
[01:39:46.180 --> 01:39:47.540]   You think, well, that doesn't make any sense.
[01:39:47.540 --> 01:39:49.060]   It's like the most illogical thing in the world.
[01:39:49.060 --> 01:39:50.220]   Like you get burned on the stove
[01:39:50.220 --> 01:39:51.940]   and you keep going back to the stove.
[01:39:51.940 --> 01:39:54.120]   And the idea is that these circuits,
[01:39:54.120 --> 01:39:55.100]   when they get activated,
[01:39:55.100 --> 01:39:58.900]   really engage entire cognitive scripts.
[01:39:58.900 --> 01:40:00.260]   They make it very hard to escape.
[01:40:00.260 --> 01:40:01.740]   It's like it pulls you into a story
[01:40:01.740 --> 01:40:05.660]   that is exquisitely hard to get away from.
[01:40:05.660 --> 01:40:07.460]   And so that this repetition compulsion
[01:40:07.460 --> 01:40:09.860]   is an attempt to try and rewrite the story.
[01:40:09.860 --> 01:40:12.740]   And this is a theory, not just a Freudian psychology,
[01:40:12.740 --> 01:40:13.980]   but a kind of modern trauma
[01:40:13.980 --> 01:40:16.580]   and neuroscience-informed trauma therapies.
[01:40:16.580 --> 01:40:19.620]   In any event, as you described,
[01:40:19.620 --> 01:40:21.420]   this pulling on a brick wall,
[01:40:21.420 --> 01:40:24.100]   I find it a very compelling image
[01:40:24.100 --> 01:40:29.100]   and one that makes total sense to try and drop the rope,
[01:40:29.100 --> 01:40:30.380]   as you describe it,
[01:40:30.380 --> 01:40:33.280]   because of the incredibly high energetic demand
[01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:34.600]   that pulling on that rope represents.
[01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:39.180]   As you said, it's sort of a way of diverting resources
[01:40:39.180 --> 01:40:43.060]   towards something that has no conclusion, right?
[01:40:43.060 --> 01:40:44.200]   And in dropping the rope,
[01:40:44.200 --> 01:40:46.940]   you can divert those resources towards other things.
[01:40:46.940 --> 01:40:48.960]   So I was just curious, again,
[01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:50.680]   I wasn't consulted the design phase
[01:40:50.680 --> 01:40:51.680]   and I'm assuming you weren't either,
[01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:55.840]   but I wonder what in us as scientists,
[01:40:55.840 --> 01:40:58.140]   I'm just kind of doing the Gedanken experiment here.
[01:40:58.140 --> 01:41:01.160]   I wonder what in us as human beings compels us
[01:41:01.160 --> 01:41:04.440]   to try and change what we, the unchangeable.
[01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:12.560]   - We really, really, really love control.
[01:41:12.560 --> 01:41:15.020]   And we want to control the future,
[01:41:15.880 --> 01:41:19.160]   not just because it makes us feel powerful and happy,
[01:41:19.160 --> 01:41:22.680]   but because then we can relax.
[01:41:22.680 --> 01:41:25.800]   If we know what's gonna happen next, if it's predictable,
[01:41:25.800 --> 01:41:28.960]   we're that much happier.
[01:41:28.960 --> 01:41:31.120]   We're not vigilant and looking ahead
[01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:34.200]   and being prepared for what might happen.
[01:41:34.200 --> 01:41:35.220]   So let me ask you that.
[01:41:35.220 --> 01:41:38.760]   So I have two whole chapters in the stress prescription.
[01:41:38.760 --> 01:41:42.080]   One is on uncertainty and one is on control.
[01:41:42.080 --> 01:41:46.920]   And these drive us crazy until we can somewhat master
[01:41:46.920 --> 01:41:50.060]   and understand how little control we have
[01:41:50.060 --> 01:41:53.440]   and how much uncertainty there is and will always be.
[01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:54.760]   So let me ask you this.
[01:41:54.760 --> 01:41:56.900]   If you couldn't plan your day tomorrow
[01:41:56.900 --> 01:42:03.060]   and you wanted to know with certainty what your plans were,
[01:42:03.060 --> 01:42:08.060]   what was gonna happen, how much ease and relaxation
[01:42:08.060 --> 01:42:11.420]   would you feel at the not knowing
[01:42:11.420 --> 01:42:12.560]   what's gonna happen tomorrow?
[01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:14.000]   - Very little.
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:15.880]   - So like on a one through 10 scale,
[01:42:15.880 --> 01:42:18.780]   how much would that drive you crazy tomorrow?
[01:42:18.780 --> 01:42:21.740]   - Tomorrow is a Saturday, so I'm a little more flexible.
[01:42:21.740 --> 01:42:22.580]   - On Monday.
[01:42:22.580 --> 01:42:26.160]   - Oh no, Mondays are mine.
[01:42:26.160 --> 01:42:27.000]   I own Monday.
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:27.820]   No, I'm kidding.
[01:42:27.820 --> 01:42:28.660]   I'm just kidding.
[01:42:28.660 --> 01:42:29.500]   I love Mondays.
[01:42:29.500 --> 01:42:31.000]   It's always been my favorite day of the week.
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:34.400]   Even when I was in school.
[01:42:34.400 --> 01:42:39.380]   Yeah, that would be a six, six out of 10.
[01:42:39.380 --> 01:42:42.360]   And that's not unusual.
[01:42:42.360 --> 01:42:45.520]   And we have a scale to measure how comfortable people are
[01:42:45.520 --> 01:42:46.680]   with certainty.
[01:42:46.680 --> 01:42:51.520]   And what we already knew was that being comfortable
[01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:55.760]   with uncertainty is a beautiful but rare resilience factor.
[01:42:55.760 --> 01:42:59.800]   People who tolerate uncertainty have much less anxiety
[01:42:59.800 --> 01:43:00.720]   and depression.
[01:43:00.720 --> 01:43:02.640]   And when stressful things happen,
[01:43:02.640 --> 01:43:03.920]   they get over it more quickly.
[01:43:03.920 --> 01:43:06.000]   So we measured this during the pandemic.
[01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:10.700]   And what we found was that intolerance of uncertainty,
[01:43:10.700 --> 01:43:13.080]   pretty strongly predicted pandemic,
[01:43:13.080 --> 01:43:18.080]   anxiety, PTSD, depression, and distress about the fires,
[01:43:18.080 --> 01:43:21.560]   the climate situation in California.
[01:43:21.560 --> 01:43:23.580]   So this is interesting.
[01:43:23.580 --> 01:43:25.720]   I mean, is this like a fixed personality
[01:43:25.720 --> 01:43:28.420]   and we're just stuck with our rigidity
[01:43:28.420 --> 01:43:30.100]   around wanting certainty?
[01:43:30.100 --> 01:43:33.860]   Or is this something that we like a muscle that we can build?
[01:43:33.860 --> 01:43:36.920]   So I think it's the latter.
[01:43:36.920 --> 01:43:39.580]   And I think there are practices we can do
[01:43:39.580 --> 01:43:44.180]   that help us feel ease with the uncertain future.
[01:43:44.180 --> 01:43:46.760]   Some of these mindful check-ins,
[01:43:46.760 --> 01:43:50.600]   noticing that we are carrying around uncertainty stress
[01:43:50.600 --> 01:43:52.960]   is one way.
[01:43:52.960 --> 01:43:55.820]   And then reframing uncertainty
[01:43:55.820 --> 01:43:59.880]   as the beauty of the mystery of life
[01:43:59.880 --> 01:44:04.340]   and the freedom that we can feel when we realize
[01:44:04.340 --> 01:44:06.460]   we don't control tomorrow.
[01:44:06.460 --> 01:44:09.980]   We just go with it and we do our best
[01:44:09.980 --> 01:44:13.900]   and what delight there is in just viewing things
[01:44:13.900 --> 01:44:16.740]   with curiosity and just seeing what emerges.
[01:44:16.740 --> 01:44:18.060]   So even just our posture,
[01:44:18.060 --> 01:44:21.060]   well, here's an exercise for dealing with uncertainty.
[01:44:21.060 --> 01:44:23.700]   Instead of like kind of that alert posture
[01:44:23.700 --> 01:44:25.300]   when we're like trying to take it all in
[01:44:25.300 --> 01:44:30.000]   and predict the next second and like just lean back
[01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:33.040]   and take some slow breaths.
[01:44:33.040 --> 01:44:35.680]   We know that's gonna help orient us
[01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:38.940]   and realize that we can actually face time in that way
[01:44:38.940 --> 01:44:43.940]   by letting it come to us and receiving what happens.
[01:44:43.940 --> 01:44:48.320]   And that's a completely different body stance
[01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:51.200]   than our usual go mode during the day.
[01:44:51.200 --> 01:44:52.920]   And that's just a way of saying,
[01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.720]   I am in a receptive mode
[01:44:56.720 --> 01:45:01.000]   and I'm going to just be curious about what arises.
[01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.680]   And so I actually learned that on a meditation retreat
[01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:06.160]   because I tend to be type A
[01:45:06.160 --> 01:45:08.840]   and I leave a retreat going from like very relaxed
[01:45:08.840 --> 01:45:12.080]   to like that leaning forward tense of like,
[01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:13.640]   where's the to-do list?
[01:45:13.640 --> 01:45:16.680]   And so carrying with me that posture of like,
[01:45:16.680 --> 01:45:21.680]   just see, let time unfold as it will
[01:45:22.600 --> 01:45:24.240]   without trying to control things.
[01:45:24.240 --> 01:45:26.200]   - It's really interesting.
[01:45:26.200 --> 01:45:27.240]   It gets right to the heart of something
[01:45:27.240 --> 01:45:28.840]   that I spent a lot of time thinking about
[01:45:28.840 --> 01:45:31.900]   in the context of stress management
[01:45:31.900 --> 01:45:35.160]   and also just general thriving,
[01:45:35.160 --> 01:45:39.480]   which is that I think that about half of the messages
[01:45:39.480 --> 01:45:43.720]   that we get related to stress and mind-body interventions
[01:45:43.720 --> 01:45:46.500]   relate to adopting this forward center of mass.
[01:45:48.680 --> 01:45:53.680]   This idea of, okay, stress can give us early dementia,
[01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:54.920]   stress can limit our sleep,
[01:45:54.920 --> 01:45:56.480]   stress can impair our cognition,
[01:45:56.480 --> 01:45:59.520]   or stress can make us more resilient.
[01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:00.920]   Stress can activate all sorts
[01:46:00.920 --> 01:46:03.480]   of positive anti-inflammatory pathways as well,
[01:46:03.480 --> 01:46:04.600]   that the mindset matters.
[01:46:04.600 --> 01:46:07.280]   And here I'm doing a terrible job of it,
[01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:11.760]   but I'm trying to scrape off and capture the top contour
[01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:15.240]   of the beautiful work of my colleague, Dr. Aaliyah Crum,
[01:46:15.240 --> 01:46:17.980]   who's been on this podcast
[01:46:17.980 --> 01:46:20.580]   and is a huge fan of her work as well.
[01:46:20.580 --> 01:46:24.440]   And that mindset matters because it shapes physiology
[01:46:24.440 --> 01:46:27.540]   for sure, her data point to that.
[01:46:27.540 --> 01:46:29.720]   So there are these kind of forward center of mass
[01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:34.200]   type approaches, and these are abundant on social media.
[01:46:34.200 --> 01:46:37.760]   Different people come to mind.
[01:46:37.760 --> 01:46:41.020]   Different archetypes really have emerged,
[01:46:41.020 --> 01:46:42.720]   millions and millions of followers
[01:46:42.720 --> 01:46:45.920]   that are the archetypes of when challenge arises,
[01:46:45.920 --> 01:46:48.840]   you smash into it, you go through it, right?
[01:46:48.840 --> 01:46:52.100]   And then on the other hand,
[01:46:52.100 --> 01:46:54.180]   there are these stress mitigation techniques,
[01:46:54.180 --> 01:46:57.340]   both mental and physical, body-oriented, mind-oriented,
[01:46:57.340 --> 01:46:59.880]   et cetera, that are more of the sort that you described
[01:46:59.880 --> 01:47:04.740]   that are, they're not being back on your heels, so to speak,
[01:47:04.740 --> 01:47:06.800]   like letting things bulldoze you,
[01:47:06.800 --> 01:47:09.420]   but are more of this receptive mode
[01:47:09.420 --> 01:47:11.380]   and have more of an awareness mode.
[01:47:11.380 --> 01:47:12.220]   - Exactly.
[01:47:12.220 --> 01:47:15.600]   - And I think that since here we are at the table
[01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:19.620]   to researchers who focus on these issues a lot,
[01:47:19.620 --> 01:47:22.980]   do you think it's fair for us to adopt
[01:47:22.980 --> 01:47:24.920]   a sort of a general framework and model
[01:47:24.920 --> 01:47:27.300]   that perhaps people can adopt for themselves if they like,
[01:47:27.300 --> 01:47:30.080]   that of course it's not an either or,
[01:47:30.080 --> 01:47:33.500]   but that having both of these in one's kit of tools
[01:47:33.500 --> 01:47:35.320]   could be valuable?
[01:47:35.320 --> 01:47:38.960]   Because one is less energetically demanding,
[01:47:38.960 --> 01:47:42.520]   but of course offers less opportunity for agency,
[01:47:42.520 --> 01:47:44.640]   or at least apparently so, that's the leaning back.
[01:47:44.640 --> 01:47:46.620]   And then the other is,
[01:47:46.620 --> 01:47:48.940]   certainly gives an opportunity for agency,
[01:47:48.940 --> 01:47:52.460]   but we know from a hundred years or more of psychology
[01:47:52.460 --> 01:47:54.120]   and psychiatric literature,
[01:47:54.120 --> 01:47:56.920]   and from the emerging literature on stress mitigation,
[01:47:56.920 --> 01:47:59.860]   that it's work.
[01:47:59.860 --> 01:48:02.680]   It's not something that is without a cost.
[01:48:02.680 --> 01:48:05.040]   It can get you far better results
[01:48:05.040 --> 01:48:08.100]   than it were you to just let stress bulldoze you,
[01:48:08.100 --> 01:48:09.360]   but that it's work.
[01:48:09.360 --> 01:48:12.020]   And so we have to emphasize that work
[01:48:12.020 --> 01:48:14.080]   in very deliberate ways.
[01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:16.360]   - Exactly, I couldn't agree more.
[01:48:16.360 --> 01:48:20.400]   It's work, when we know it's productive, we should work.
[01:48:20.400 --> 01:48:23.560]   And when we know there's a brick wall, we should let go.
[01:48:23.560 --> 01:48:25.900]   So I think of it, I like this forward mass idea.
[01:48:25.900 --> 01:48:30.720]   I think of it as you muscle it and or you release it,
[01:48:30.720 --> 01:48:32.200]   and we need both.
[01:48:32.200 --> 01:48:36.760]   And so that letting go is a really important wise,
[01:48:36.760 --> 01:48:41.460]   discerning way to mitigate stress in the right situations
[01:48:41.460 --> 01:48:42.580]   in the right time.
[01:48:42.580 --> 01:48:44.960]   And we can't muscle through everything, right?
[01:48:44.960 --> 01:48:46.580]   So another way I like to think about it
[01:48:46.580 --> 01:48:48.780]   is just the waves of life.
[01:48:48.780 --> 01:48:52.480]   Like, I mean, we are in an ocean and we have small waves,
[01:48:52.480 --> 01:48:53.400]   we have big waves.
[01:48:53.400 --> 01:48:56.080]   Some of these tidal waves are gonna hit all of us,
[01:48:56.080 --> 01:48:59.940]   the global stressors, the climate disasters that will come.
[01:48:59.940 --> 01:49:02.940]   And so when we're not in the middle of a wave,
[01:49:02.940 --> 01:49:06.880]   which is when we need to muscle it, we're between waves.
[01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:11.880]   How much control do we have to fight the tide there?
[01:49:12.660 --> 01:49:13.940]   Some.
[01:49:13.940 --> 01:49:15.420]   It's not black or white.
[01:49:15.420 --> 01:49:18.400]   We can't fight a rip tide,
[01:49:18.400 --> 01:49:21.820]   we need to go the direction of the tide,
[01:49:21.820 --> 01:49:25.740]   but we can have some control on our direction.
[01:49:25.740 --> 01:49:28.940]   And it kind of goes back to our colleague,
[01:49:28.940 --> 01:49:33.380]   Robert Sapolsky's very biologically based idea of us having,
[01:49:33.380 --> 01:49:36.100]   he's a little bit extreme with a no free will.
[01:49:36.100 --> 01:49:40.380]   We are influenced by all of these things around us,
[01:49:40.380 --> 01:49:43.980]   as well as all of our biological,
[01:49:43.980 --> 01:49:49.980]   I'll say brilliant evolutionary animal instincts.
[01:49:49.980 --> 01:49:52.200]   So given all of that,
[01:49:52.200 --> 01:49:57.200]   we have some deterministic forces on us.
[01:49:57.200 --> 01:50:02.660]   And within that, we get to ease up between the waves
[01:50:02.660 --> 01:50:05.560]   when we can, we get to change our direction.
[01:50:05.560 --> 01:50:07.920]   We're always gonna be hit by the next wave.
[01:50:07.920 --> 01:50:12.180]   And so it's this skillful surfing or navigating
[01:50:12.180 --> 01:50:16.240]   that we can do better when we realize,
[01:50:16.240 --> 01:50:19.780]   when we control things, when we can truly feel safe
[01:50:19.780 --> 01:50:23.320]   and have ease versus when we need to kind of gently paddle.
[01:50:23.320 --> 01:50:28.740]   - What do you think is the value of journaling
[01:50:28.740 --> 01:50:32.820]   and placing one's own narrative on stressful circumstances,
[01:50:32.820 --> 01:50:35.520]   especially these non-negotiable circumstances?
[01:50:35.520 --> 01:50:36.860]   Again, I'm fascinated by these
[01:50:36.860 --> 01:50:38.380]   because I think it's a category of stress
[01:50:38.380 --> 01:50:42.260]   that's not often talked about and yet is so prominent.
[01:50:42.260 --> 01:50:43.540]   So people will say, okay,
[01:50:43.540 --> 01:50:44.500]   dealing with short-term stress.
[01:50:44.500 --> 01:50:47.420]   Okay, well, I would say like use physiological size
[01:50:47.420 --> 01:50:48.680]   or raise your stress threshold.
[01:50:48.680 --> 01:50:50.780]   And we'll get back to that in a little bit
[01:50:50.780 --> 01:50:52.820]   as it relates to the work you're doing with breath work.
[01:50:52.820 --> 01:50:57.740]   But so many stressors are gonna take a year or five years.
[01:50:57.740 --> 01:51:01.580]   We don't know the uncertainty that you mentioned earlier
[01:51:01.580 --> 01:51:05.340]   or the certainty that this is gonna go on forever.
[01:51:05.340 --> 01:51:10.340]   And so for people that are listening to this
[01:51:10.340 --> 01:51:14.520]   and want to start to adopt practices,
[01:51:14.520 --> 01:51:20.140]   do you think that spending some time creating a written
[01:51:20.140 --> 01:51:22.540]   or a spoken narrative is helpful?
[01:51:22.540 --> 01:51:24.820]   I mean, we hear this, but are there any data
[01:51:24.820 --> 01:51:27.820]   that support the use of journaling as a tool?
[01:51:27.820 --> 01:51:30.160]   I seem to recall that there are a few studies out there,
[01:51:30.160 --> 01:51:32.180]   but I can't remember exactly.
[01:51:32.180 --> 01:51:36.620]   Yeah, definitely creating a coherent narrative
[01:51:36.620 --> 01:51:40.900]   is critical to our ability to make sense,
[01:51:40.900 --> 01:51:43.380]   find meaning, find resolution,
[01:51:43.380 --> 01:51:47.220]   have a social identity around our lived experience,
[01:51:47.220 --> 01:51:48.220]   what happens to us.
[01:51:48.220 --> 01:51:50.660]   So narrative is kind of everything, right?
[01:51:50.660 --> 01:51:53.100]   In stress research, it's not what happens to us,
[01:51:53.100 --> 01:51:54.180]   it's how we're interpreting it
[01:51:54.180 --> 01:51:57.680]   and how we're responding to it.
[01:51:57.680 --> 01:51:59.800]   And I've heard you say the exact same thing
[01:51:59.800 --> 01:52:01.860]   when you've talked about what is stress.
[01:52:01.860 --> 01:52:04.620]   It's really what narrative we're creating around it.
[01:52:04.620 --> 01:52:06.900]   So I think a narrative of purpose,
[01:52:06.900 --> 01:52:10.380]   fill in the blank about what's meaningful to you,
[01:52:10.380 --> 01:52:13.500]   but that is why we're different than just
[01:52:13.500 --> 01:52:17.780]   the rats that we study or the monkeys.
[01:52:17.780 --> 01:52:21.640]   They have these amazing stress responses
[01:52:21.640 --> 01:52:25.620]   that we have them too, and we can't control that,
[01:52:25.620 --> 01:52:29.300]   but we have the ability to do this projection to the future,
[01:52:29.300 --> 01:52:31.300]   to ask what is our purpose in life,
[01:52:31.300 --> 01:52:35.740]   to see and know that we are going to die
[01:52:35.740 --> 01:52:39.860]   and we can have some control over how we live
[01:52:39.860 --> 01:52:42.980]   and maybe even how we die and how we want to be remembered.
[01:52:42.980 --> 01:52:44.640]   That is so beautiful.
[01:52:44.640 --> 01:52:48.260]   That helps us rise above this being monkeys in clothes.
[01:52:48.260 --> 01:52:54.180]   - I'd love before we wrap for us to return to this question
[01:52:54.180 --> 01:52:56.920]   about breath work and the study that you're doing.
[01:52:56.920 --> 01:52:58.820]   I've known about your work for a very long time,
[01:52:58.820 --> 01:53:00.100]   admired it for a very long time.
[01:53:00.100 --> 01:53:02.820]   And one of the things that excited me
[01:53:02.820 --> 01:53:04.140]   about being able to sit down with you today
[01:53:04.140 --> 01:53:07.020]   is that our laboratories studied breath work,
[01:53:07.020 --> 01:53:08.360]   your laboratory studying breath work.
[01:53:08.360 --> 01:53:12.100]   And I know that you've been doing a study
[01:53:12.100 --> 01:53:15.020]   on the so-called Wim Hof method,
[01:53:15.020 --> 01:53:17.580]   which I'll let you familiarize our listeners to.
[01:53:17.580 --> 01:53:19.460]   Some of them are familiar with the Wim Hof method,
[01:53:19.460 --> 01:53:20.300]   others are not.
[01:53:20.300 --> 01:53:21.660]   I think a lot of people think of Wim
[01:53:21.660 --> 01:53:23.660]   in terms of his role as the ice man
[01:53:23.660 --> 01:53:24.860]   'cause of cold exposure.
[01:53:24.860 --> 01:53:27.220]   But of course he has breath work practices
[01:53:27.220 --> 01:53:31.480]   that mirror things like Tummo breathing and other things.
[01:53:31.480 --> 01:53:33.140]   But maybe you could tell us a little bit
[01:53:33.140 --> 01:53:34.340]   about what you're doing there
[01:53:34.340 --> 01:53:36.300]   and what you're interested in discovering.
[01:53:36.300 --> 01:53:38.160]   I realize it's too early to give us the results,
[01:53:38.160 --> 01:53:41.060]   but hopefully we'll come back and do that another time.
[01:53:41.060 --> 01:53:43.280]   But what is the study?
[01:53:43.280 --> 01:53:44.700]   What motivated the study?
[01:53:44.700 --> 01:53:47.440]   And maybe I can convince you to give us a little teaser
[01:53:47.440 --> 01:53:48.460]   of what you're discovering.
[01:53:48.460 --> 01:53:53.460]   - So for many years, I mean, I think my first paper
[01:53:54.980 --> 01:53:57.460]   when I was a graduate student with Boost McEwen
[01:53:57.460 --> 01:54:01.860]   was about this idea of positive physiological stress.
[01:54:01.860 --> 01:54:06.320]   And so I've always been wanting to really understand
[01:54:06.320 --> 01:54:08.940]   what's positive stress, how can we induce it?
[01:54:08.940 --> 01:54:11.600]   And instead for too many years,
[01:54:11.600 --> 01:54:13.220]   I've been studying the dark side,
[01:54:13.220 --> 01:54:15.820]   toxic stress, trauma, caregiving,
[01:54:15.820 --> 01:54:18.860]   and how that can take a toll on the body
[01:54:18.860 --> 01:54:21.520]   without the right resilience and resources.
[01:54:21.520 --> 01:54:26.520]   And now I'm very excited about the opportunity
[01:54:26.520 --> 01:54:34.580]   to just focus on different ways that we can stress out
[01:54:34.580 --> 01:54:37.780]   our body and mind in short-term bursts
[01:54:37.780 --> 01:54:40.000]   that might promote stress resilience.
[01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:44.660]   And the body-based strategies are concrete, they're quick,
[01:54:44.660 --> 01:54:49.060]   they're also my favorite strategies.
[01:54:49.060 --> 01:54:51.600]   I probably have internalized a lot of the mindsets
[01:54:51.600 --> 01:54:53.880]   and the things that I've learned from meditation.
[01:54:53.880 --> 01:54:56.800]   And what I feel the biggest bang for the buck is,
[01:54:56.800 --> 01:55:00.860]   you know, if I'm waking up like super jittery
[01:55:00.860 --> 01:55:04.080]   with a big stress response because of X or Y,
[01:55:04.080 --> 01:55:08.480]   it is actually something like a HIIT type workout
[01:55:08.480 --> 01:55:10.680]   or taking the dogs for like a really brisk walk
[01:55:10.680 --> 01:55:13.340]   or like burning up that energy in my body
[01:55:13.340 --> 01:55:18.220]   is a very big effect size for me personally.
[01:55:18.220 --> 01:55:20.580]   Everyone has their, you know, different ways
[01:55:20.580 --> 01:55:25.540]   that they can see the biggest shifts in daily stress.
[01:55:25.540 --> 01:55:28.500]   So I've been looking for ways to create positive stress
[01:55:28.500 --> 01:55:30.820]   besides exercise, we all know about exercise.
[01:55:30.820 --> 01:55:34.380]   And I met Wim Hof at a meeting
[01:55:34.380 --> 01:55:38.280]   where we talked kind of back to back.
[01:55:38.280 --> 01:55:41.660]   And so we hadn't, I had kind of heard something about,
[01:55:41.660 --> 01:55:44.080]   you know, crazy ice man climbing up the Himalayas.
[01:55:44.080 --> 01:55:44.920]   I really hadn't.
[01:55:44.920 --> 01:55:48.060]   - I think he has 27 or more world records
[01:55:48.060 --> 01:55:49.880]   for that sort of thing, yeah.
[01:55:49.880 --> 01:55:51.940]   - So he, so I got to hear,
[01:55:51.940 --> 01:55:55.700]   I got to do the breathing with him during this conference
[01:55:55.700 --> 01:55:58.060]   and I just felt like elation afterward.
[01:55:58.060 --> 01:55:59.940]   I was like, what was that?
[01:55:59.940 --> 01:56:02.500]   And then he heard about telomeres and he was like,
[01:56:02.500 --> 01:56:05.420]   I need to know if my method is affecting cell aging.
[01:56:05.420 --> 01:56:06.900]   He loves research.
[01:56:06.900 --> 01:56:10.740]   And so we, he helped us design a study
[01:56:10.740 --> 01:56:12.940]   that we've been working on at UCSF
[01:56:12.940 --> 01:56:16.420]   with my colleagues, Wendy Mendez and Eric Prather.
[01:56:16.420 --> 01:56:18.080]   It's been many years and it's funded
[01:56:18.080 --> 01:56:20.780]   by the John W. Brick Foundation,
[01:56:20.780 --> 01:56:24.540]   which is very focused on what are non-drug ways
[01:56:24.540 --> 01:56:26.740]   that we can help mental health.
[01:56:26.740 --> 01:56:29.100]   So it was a very good fit for all of us to come together,
[01:56:29.100 --> 01:56:30.300]   design the study.
[01:56:30.300 --> 01:56:35.300]   And we have been basically comparing low arousal,
[01:56:35.300 --> 01:56:38.920]   relaxation methods, mindfulness, slow breathing
[01:56:38.920 --> 01:56:42.980]   to positive stress, exercise and Wim Hof method.
[01:56:42.980 --> 01:56:46.780]   And one of the things that we've learned in a big way
[01:56:46.780 --> 01:56:49.460]   is that regardless of whether we're creating
[01:56:49.460 --> 01:56:53.520]   deep states of ease or hermetic stress in the body,
[01:56:53.520 --> 01:56:56.340]   that short-term burst of either aerobic activity
[01:56:56.340 --> 01:57:01.220]   or the extreme breathing, people feel better, period.
[01:57:01.220 --> 01:57:03.500]   So three weeks later after this experiment
[01:57:03.500 --> 01:57:05.420]   of doing their practice every day,
[01:57:05.420 --> 01:57:06.920]   they were either randomly assigned
[01:57:06.920 --> 01:57:09.380]   to the high arousal or the low arousal,
[01:57:09.380 --> 01:57:11.700]   the level of stress, anxiety and depression
[01:57:11.700 --> 01:57:14.460]   fell dramatically in everyone.
[01:57:14.460 --> 01:57:18.860]   So many paths to changes in stress.
[01:57:18.860 --> 01:57:22.540]   There are probably very different physiological pathways
[01:57:22.540 --> 01:57:25.140]   and we can talk about that more
[01:57:25.140 --> 01:57:28.900]   when we get to really look in depth
[01:57:28.900 --> 01:57:32.180]   at our physiological data as well as our blood-based data.
[01:57:32.180 --> 01:57:35.820]   But what we do know is that the Wim Hof method
[01:57:35.820 --> 01:57:40.660]   did create daily positive emotion that increased over time,
[01:57:40.660 --> 01:57:43.980]   just like your study on sighing.
[01:57:43.980 --> 01:57:46.020]   And so even though there are different mechanisms,
[01:57:46.020 --> 01:57:50.620]   they were selectively boosting feelings of positivity.
[01:57:50.620 --> 01:57:51.660]   I love that.
[01:57:51.660 --> 01:57:53.460]   You know, that's very unusual
[01:57:53.460 --> 01:57:56.100]   to get a very selective positive effect.
[01:57:56.100 --> 01:57:57.820]   - Super interesting.
[01:57:57.820 --> 01:58:00.320]   I can't wait to hear more about the data.
[01:58:00.320 --> 01:58:04.040]   So I gather, and by the way, no is a perfectly fine answer.
[01:58:04.040 --> 01:58:05.800]   I gather that you're not gonna tell us about
[01:58:05.800 --> 01:58:08.260]   whether or not there are telomere changes yet,
[01:58:08.260 --> 01:58:11.780]   or maybe that's not possible to detect
[01:58:11.780 --> 01:58:13.480]   in this kind of short-term study.
[01:58:13.480 --> 01:58:16.220]   - So what we're going to look at,
[01:58:16.220 --> 01:58:19.340]   we don't really think that telomeres
[01:58:19.340 --> 01:58:23.820]   can change very quickly and telomerase may.
[01:58:23.820 --> 01:58:27.220]   So we're gonna look at mitochondrial enzymes, telomerase,
[01:58:27.220 --> 01:58:29.120]   and gene expression patterns.
[01:58:29.120 --> 01:58:32.560]   And as you know, we can look at many different mechanisms
[01:58:32.560 --> 01:58:34.460]   and pathways with gene expression patterns,
[01:58:34.460 --> 01:58:37.020]   especially with these new kind of assays
[01:58:37.020 --> 01:58:38.940]   where you can look at, you know,
[01:58:38.940 --> 01:58:43.940]   7,000 different proteins like the somalogic.
[01:58:43.940 --> 01:58:46.700]   And so we'll get to see, well, what's the pattern?
[01:58:46.700 --> 01:58:49.140]   You know, did we really change patterns of acute stress
[01:58:49.140 --> 01:58:52.980]   with these different types of stress resilience interventions
[01:58:52.980 --> 01:58:56.120]   and in terms of the physiological reactivity,
[01:58:56.120 --> 01:58:59.780]   there are ways that we can
[01:58:59.780 --> 01:59:04.900]   examine both the stress response system,
[01:59:04.900 --> 01:59:07.380]   the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic
[01:59:07.380 --> 01:59:08.660]   response system.
[01:59:08.660 --> 01:59:10.860]   And I will tell you that
[01:59:10.860 --> 01:59:12.820]   while we're still preparing the results,
[01:59:12.820 --> 01:59:15.300]   there were very different profiles
[01:59:15.300 --> 01:59:17.100]   from the different interventions
[01:59:17.100 --> 01:59:20.820]   that make us think that there's a lot of specificity,
[01:59:20.820 --> 01:59:23.060]   even though everyone feels better,
[01:59:23.060 --> 01:59:25.500]   the way that they got there is very different,
[01:59:25.500 --> 01:59:27.140]   the ways that we're impacting both
[01:59:27.140 --> 01:59:28.740]   the nervous system and the brain.
[01:59:28.740 --> 01:59:30.720]   - Incredible.
[01:59:30.720 --> 01:59:32.100]   And I have to say,
[01:59:32.100 --> 01:59:33.920]   when I heard that you were studying Wim Hof Method,
[01:59:33.920 --> 01:59:37.380]   I was positively delighted
[01:59:37.380 --> 01:59:42.380]   because I find that there are so few
[01:59:42.380 --> 01:59:48.120]   serious researchers in the realm of modern science
[01:59:48.120 --> 01:59:51.540]   that are both explorers and then take what they've,
[01:59:51.540 --> 01:59:53.940]   you know, gleaned from those explorations
[01:59:53.940 --> 01:59:55.380]   and then take it to the laboratory
[01:59:55.380 --> 01:59:59.100]   and put rigor on those and really try and parse mechanism
[01:59:59.100 --> 02:00:01.060]   with, of course, all the open-mindedness
[02:00:01.060 --> 02:00:02.900]   to whatever the outcome happens to be, right?
[02:00:02.900 --> 02:00:04.780]   I mean, good science involves
[02:00:04.780 --> 02:00:06.660]   not necessarily asking questions alone,
[02:00:06.660 --> 02:00:09.540]   but raising hypotheses and being comfortable
[02:00:09.540 --> 02:00:12.620]   for those hypotheses to be correct or not correct.
[02:00:12.620 --> 02:00:15.700]   And I find your work to be just so incredibly
[02:00:15.700 --> 02:00:17.560]   creative and brave in that way.
[02:00:17.560 --> 02:00:19.360]   And I love the way that you've meshed
[02:00:19.360 --> 02:00:22.300]   different aspects of your own personal journey
[02:00:22.300 --> 02:00:23.500]   into these different practices.
[02:00:23.500 --> 02:00:24.460]   I don't know what came first,
[02:00:24.460 --> 02:00:28.100]   the science of the practices, but I have my guesses,
[02:00:28.100 --> 02:00:32.940]   but I must say it's very refreshing
[02:00:32.940 --> 02:00:37.380]   and I think it's exactly what the world needs right now
[02:00:37.380 --> 02:00:40.460]   in terms of tools for mental health and physical health,
[02:00:40.460 --> 02:00:45.460]   because far too many studies try and isolate variables
[02:00:45.460 --> 02:00:47.620]   without understanding a larger context of like,
[02:00:47.620 --> 02:00:48.940]   what are the different types of stressors?
[02:00:48.940 --> 02:00:50.340]   And clearly you're addressing that.
[02:00:50.340 --> 02:00:52.300]   Or, you know, there's this thing, breath work,
[02:00:52.300 --> 02:00:53.120]   that some people might think,
[02:00:53.120 --> 02:00:54.980]   oh, you know, the Iceman Wim Hof,
[02:00:54.980 --> 02:00:57.620]   it's really esoteric and, you know, kind of crazy.
[02:00:58.300 --> 02:01:00.620]   I'm certainly not saying that, but you say,
[02:01:00.620 --> 02:01:02.680]   well, what are the critical elements from that
[02:01:02.680 --> 02:01:03.980]   that we might be able to extract
[02:01:03.980 --> 02:01:06.500]   to understand this positive eustress phenomenon?
[02:01:06.500 --> 02:01:09.780]   So I just, I want to, first of all, just say thank you
[02:01:09.780 --> 02:01:12.180]   for doing the incredibly important work you do.
[02:01:12.180 --> 02:01:13.020]   - And thank you.
[02:01:13.020 --> 02:01:16.520]   I mean, we were so delighted to see the paper you did
[02:01:16.520 --> 02:01:18.480]   with David Spiegel and to know
[02:01:18.480 --> 02:01:19.900]   that you're pursuing this path.
[02:01:19.900 --> 02:01:24.820]   And it's very reassuring with your rigor
[02:01:24.820 --> 02:01:26.840]   and your, you know, depth of background.
[02:01:26.840 --> 02:01:28.000]   I agree with you.
[02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:29.660]   These are the types of studies we need.
[02:01:29.660 --> 02:01:34.660]   Releasing the inherent power of rejuvenation
[02:01:34.660 --> 02:01:39.260]   that's in our body is, it's relatively untapped
[02:01:39.260 --> 02:01:41.540]   in these rigorous controlled studies.
[02:01:41.540 --> 02:01:45.340]   And we just can't reduce inflammation with a drug.
[02:01:45.340 --> 02:01:47.120]   We can't reduce stress with a drug.
[02:01:47.120 --> 02:01:50.020]   We desperately need to learn how to use, you know,
[02:01:50.020 --> 02:01:53.140]   the whole range of the nervous system from the acute stress
[02:01:53.140 --> 02:01:57.460]   to the deep relaxation to heal and to promote
[02:01:57.460 --> 02:01:59.660]   these healthy resilient states.
[02:01:59.660 --> 02:02:00.940]   - Couldn't agree more.
[02:02:00.940 --> 02:02:04.800]   And UCSF is very, very fortunate to have you.
[02:02:04.800 --> 02:02:06.080]   And should they ever forget that,
[02:02:06.080 --> 02:02:07.560]   please come to Stanford instead.
[02:02:07.560 --> 02:02:09.720]   Maybe we can recruit you away from UCSF.
[02:02:09.720 --> 02:02:12.600]   And I'm here, I'm being friendly to my colleagues at UCSF,
[02:02:12.600 --> 02:02:15.840]   but they better treat you right or else we're coming for you.
[02:02:15.840 --> 02:02:19.580]   And I also just want to thank you for taking the time today
[02:02:19.580 --> 02:02:21.000]   to share this information.
[02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:22.500]   Also, you've written wonderful books.
[02:02:22.500 --> 02:02:24.100]   We will provide a link to the newest one.
[02:02:24.100 --> 02:02:26.520]   And I'll, of course, cue people to that
[02:02:26.520 --> 02:02:29.660]   because it sounds like a very rich source of information
[02:02:29.660 --> 02:02:31.660]   and actionable tools that people can take
[02:02:31.660 --> 02:02:33.460]   in terms of mitigating stress.
[02:02:33.460 --> 02:02:36.320]   And I love the idea that there's this discussion
[02:02:36.320 --> 02:02:39.980]   about certainty and control to elements
[02:02:39.980 --> 02:02:44.260]   that are very prominent in my life, better or for worse.
[02:02:44.260 --> 02:02:45.600]   [laughing]
[02:02:45.600 --> 02:02:46.780]   - All of us, all of us.
[02:02:46.780 --> 02:02:49.420]   - Yeah, and so really thank you for the work you're doing.
[02:02:49.420 --> 02:02:52.580]   Thank you for taking the time to share that work through books
[02:02:52.580 --> 02:02:54.980]   and through podcasts and especially today on this one.
[02:02:54.980 --> 02:02:58.740]   I know I speak on behalf of many, many people
[02:02:58.740 --> 02:03:00.620]   and I just really want to extend my gratitude.
[02:03:00.620 --> 02:03:01.460]   - Thank you so much.
[02:03:01.460 --> 02:03:04.860]   And thank you for your podcast.
[02:03:04.860 --> 02:03:07.200]   - Well, it's a labor of love and it's days like today
[02:03:07.200 --> 02:03:09.220]   and discussions like this that make it worthwhile.
[02:03:09.220 --> 02:03:11.220]   So thank you. - Thanks, Andrew.
[02:03:11.220 --> 02:03:13.040]   - Thank you for joining me for today's discussion
[02:03:13.040 --> 02:03:17.220]   all about stress, aging and metabolism with Dr. Alyssa Apple.
[02:03:17.220 --> 02:03:19.620]   Hope you enjoyed the conversation as much as I did.
[02:03:19.620 --> 02:03:20.500]   If you'd like to learn more
[02:03:20.500 --> 02:03:22.460]   about Dr. Apple's laboratories work
[02:03:22.460 --> 02:03:23.940]   or if you'd like to learn about her books
[02:03:23.940 --> 02:03:26.980]   such as the telomere effect and the stress prescription
[02:03:26.980 --> 02:03:29.420]   please see the links in the show note captions.
[02:03:29.420 --> 02:03:31.780]   If you're learning from and or enjoying this podcast

[02:03:39.980 --> 02:03:42.180]   And in addition on both Spotify and Apple
[02:03:42.180 --> 02:03:44.500]   you can leave us up to a five-star review.
[02:03:44.500 --> 02:03:45.740]   If you have questions for me
[02:03:45.740 --> 02:03:48.640]   or topics you'd like me to cover on the Huberman Lab Podcast
[02:03:48.640 --> 02:03:50.500]   or guests that you'd like me to consider inviting
[02:03:50.500 --> 02:03:51.980]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast
[02:03:51.980 --> 02:03:54.140]   please put that in the comments on YouTube.
[02:03:54.140 --> 02:03:56.180]   I do read all the comments.
[02:03:56.180 --> 02:03:58.500]   In addition, please check out the sponsors mentioned
[02:03:58.500 --> 02:04:00.340]   that beginning and throughout today's episode
[02:04:00.340 --> 02:04:02.580]   that's the best way to support this podcast.
[02:04:02.580 --> 02:04:04.060]   Not so much on today's episode
[02:04:04.060 --> 02:04:05.440]   but on various previous episodes
[02:04:05.440 --> 02:04:08.140]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast we discuss supplements.
[02:04:08.140 --> 02:04:10.040]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody
[02:04:10.040 --> 02:04:12.100]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:04:12.100 --> 02:04:15.120]   for things like enhancing sleep, focus and hormone support.
[02:04:15.120 --> 02:04:17.020]   The Huberman Lab Podcast is proud to have partnered
[02:04:17.020 --> 02:04:18.400]   with Momentous Supplements.
[02:04:18.400 --> 02:04:20.140]   If you'd like to hear more about the supplements
[02:04:20.140 --> 02:04:21.880]   discussed on the Huberman Lab Podcast
[02:04:21.880 --> 02:04:25.880]   please go to livemomentous.com/huberman.
[02:04:25.880 --> 02:04:28.580]   Again, that's livemomentous.com/huberman.
[02:04:28.580 --> 02:04:30.800]   If you're not already following the Huberman Lab Podcast
[02:04:30.800 --> 02:04:34.200]   on social media, we are Huberman Lab on Instagram,
[02:04:34.200 --> 02:04:36.180]   Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn.
[02:04:36.180 --> 02:04:38.860]   And on all those places, I focus on material
[02:04:38.860 --> 02:04:40.580]   that somewhat overlaps with content
[02:04:40.580 --> 02:04:41.780]   from the Huberman Lab Podcast
[02:04:41.780 --> 02:04:43.640]   but often is distinct from the content
[02:04:43.640 --> 02:04:45.100]   covered on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[02:04:45.100 --> 02:04:48.100]   So again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media channels.
[02:04:48.100 --> 02:04:49.900]   For those of you that haven't already subscribed
[02:04:49.900 --> 02:04:51.960]   to our so-called neural network newsletter,
[02:04:51.960 --> 02:04:55.060]   this is a completely zero cost monthly newsletter
[02:04:55.060 --> 02:04:57.260]   that has summaries of podcast episodes
[02:04:57.260 --> 02:04:58.620]   and so-called toolkits.
[02:04:58.620 --> 02:05:02.520]   Toolkits are lists of about a page to two pages long
[02:05:02.520 --> 02:05:04.980]   that give the critical tools for instance
[02:05:04.980 --> 02:05:07.020]   for optimizing sleep or for neuroplasticity
[02:05:07.020 --> 02:05:09.340]   or deliberate cold exposure or deliberate heat exposure,
[02:05:09.340 --> 02:05:10.380]   optimizing dopamine.
[02:05:10.380 --> 02:05:12.740]   Again, all available to you at zero cost.
[02:05:12.740 --> 02:05:14.760]   You simply go to HubermanLab.com,
[02:05:14.760 --> 02:05:16.760]   go to the Menu tab in the corner,
[02:05:16.760 --> 02:05:18.000]   scroll down to Newsletter.
[02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:19.000]   You provide us your email.
[02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.160]   We do not share your email with anybody.
[02:05:21.160 --> 02:05:24.420]   And in addition to that, there are samples of toolkits
[02:05:24.420 --> 02:05:27.760]   on the HubermanLab.com website, again, under Newsletter,
[02:05:27.760 --> 02:05:29.940]   and you don't even have to sign up to access those.
[02:05:29.940 --> 02:05:31.320]   But I think most people do end up signing up
[02:05:31.320 --> 02:05:32.160]   for the newsletter
[02:05:32.160 --> 02:05:33.920]   because it's rich with useful information
[02:05:33.920 --> 02:05:35.760]   and again, completely zero cost.
[02:05:35.760 --> 02:05:37.780]   Thank you again for joining me for today's discussion
[02:05:37.780 --> 02:05:39.160]   with Dr. Alyssa Epple,
[02:05:39.160 --> 02:05:41.740]   all about stress, aging, and metabolism.
[02:05:41.740 --> 02:05:43.860]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:05:43.860 --> 02:05:45.660]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:05:45.660 --> 02:05:48.240]   [upbeat music]
[02:05:48.240 --> 02:05:50.820]   (upbeat music)
