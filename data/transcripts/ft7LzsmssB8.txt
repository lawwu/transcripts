[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.520]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:13.280]   Paul's second epistle to the Corinthians in chapter four, and I am going to read the
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.640]   first six verses.
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:24.520]   Therefore, seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not, but
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:31.040]   have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:38.360]   word of God deceitfully, but by manifestation of the truth, commending ourselves to every
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.640]   man's conscience in the sight of God.
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.600]   But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost, in whom the God of this world
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:55.240]   hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.440]   of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:06.960]   For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord, and ourselves, you are servants
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.600]   for Jesus' sake.
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:17.320]   For God, who commended the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:26.000]   to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.200]   We come back to a consideration of this great and important statement.
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.960]   We have been looking at it for a number of Sunday evenings, and we are doing so for this
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:36.960]   reason.
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.120]   The great apostle here tells us how he preached.
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:46.560]   He tells us that he had renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, that he does not walk
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.480]   in craftiness, neither does he handle the word of God deceitfully.
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.480]   He was very careful as to how he did preach this word.
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.560]   He was not concerned about personal popularity.
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.560]   He was not merely concerned to interest people, and to attract them, and to entertain them.
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.840]   These he had renounced.
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.760]   He has nothing to do with them at all.
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.680]   He tells us why, and that is what we are interested in.
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:20.240]   He tells us that he has renounced all that, because he knows that everything he does is
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.480]   done in the sight of God.
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.960]   He is not concerned about human opinion; he is concerned about the opinion of God.
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:36.880]   He knows he has got to stand before him, to stand before the judgment throne of Christ,
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.280]   as he tells us in the next chapter, and give an account of the deeds done in the body,
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.160]   whether good or bad.
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.400]   And the moment a man realizes that he has got to render up an account of his stewardship
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.560]   and of his life to God, well then, he does not become very concerned about what men and
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.400]   women may think about him.
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.520]   That is what the apostle tells us, but he has got other reasons.
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:07.120]   He is not merely giving his own opinions; he is not there to tell them what he thinks
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.040]   about life, and this and that.
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.040]   No, no.
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.280]   He is handling, as he says, the word of God.
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.920]   He is concerned about manifesting what he calls the truth.
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.760]   So it is not his at all; it has been given to him.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:31.560]   He has received it by revelation, and therefore all he is concerned to do is that he does
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.920]   not in any way stand between the people and this revelation that has been given to him.
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:45.080]   God, he says, has shined into his heart in order that he might receive this knowledge
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.040]   himself and might in turn pass it on.
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.760]   So that is another reason why he preaches as he does.
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.160]   And then, of course, he adds to this two other considerations, and that is that he is very
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.280]   concerned about the people who are listening.
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.400]   He says he makes himself their servant, for Jesus' sake.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.320]   He is prepared to be all things to all men that he might by all means save some.
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:17.280]   In other words, the apostles realize that the eternal destiny of men and women depended
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:23.420]   upon their belief in, or their rejection of, this message that he is preaching to them.
[00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.360]   And it is a very solemn thought.
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:32.040]   You see, that is what makes a service like this different from the meetings of the world.
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.280]   Your eternal destiny does not depend upon what politicians or statesmen may say.
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.360]   I am not criticizing them in saying that; that is their business and their to-do-it.
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.200]   Your eternal destiny does not depend upon what the critics say about drama, music, art,
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.160]   painting, anything you like; it is very interesting, very important.
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:55.000]   But your eternal destiny does not depend upon it, but it does depend upon this.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.760]   And so the apostle is very careful.
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:07.840]   But his greatest reason of all is that this is what he calls the gospel, good news.
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:13.720]   He has got a message of good news to men and women, and what we are concerned about is
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:20.640]   to show how this gospel comes to us as good news.
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.320]   Now then, it does it in this way.
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:29.000]   He does it, he says, by giving us light.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.840]   God who commended the light to shine out of darkness hath shined in our hearts to give
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:41.320]   the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:49.840]   The gospel of Jesus Christ gives us light, it gives us knowledge, it gives us information,
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.720]   it is a teaching.
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.920]   It is not a mere matter of opinion, I say.
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:59.400]   It is not just something that plays on our feelings; it is knowledge, it is instruction,
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.400]   information.
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.400]   It enlightens.
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:07.400]   It comes to people who are in darkness, and it gives them light.
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.120]   On what does it give light?
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:16.080]   Well, we have already seen that it gives us light on our own state and condition by nature,
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.080]   that we are like the cosmos was at the beginning when it was without form and void.
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.680]   We are all like that morally and spiritually.
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:33.480]   And then we saw last Sunday that it gives us light on the glory of Jesus Christ.
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:40.760]   We preach not ourselves, says Paul, but Christ Jesus the Lord, and ourselves you are servants
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:41.760]   for Jesus' sake.
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:46.400]   He says again, he says, "The God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:58.360]   believe not, lest the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ should shine unto them."
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.360]   Very well.
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.740]   The gospel gives us light and knowledge on those two things.
[00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:07.000]   It tells us the truth about ourselves.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.480]   It brings us to see the truth about the Lord Jesus Christ as the Son of God, the image
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:14.480]   of God.
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:20.200]   Now, that is, of course, Christianity, that the Son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ, has
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.600]   been in this world.
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.960]   The tragedy of the world tonight is that it does not know that.
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.360]   It knows it in a sense, but it does not realise it.
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:35.080]   Men are living as if the Son of God had never been into this world, but he has been.
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:42.080]   The image of God, God's own Son, has been in this world, and he has done certain things.
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.200]   And the tragedy of the world is that it does not know that.
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:46.560]   Well now then, why did he come?
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:47.560]   What did he come for?
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:51.520]   And that brings us to our matter this evening.
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:08:01.440]   He came into this world in order that we might learn about the glory of God, God who commended
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:08.040]   the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, what for?
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:20.800]   Well, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:25.840]   Now here is a most extraordinary thing.
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:28.080]   What if I were to ask a question at this point?
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:31.320]   What is the ultimate object of the gospel?
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:34.080]   Have you ever thought of that question?
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:37.040]   What answer would you give to that question?
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:41.520]   What is the real purpose of the Christian message, the Christian gospel, the Christian
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.920]   way of salvation?
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:46.440]   Why did the Son of God ever come into this world?
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.680]   Why did he die upon the cross?
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.400]   Why was he buried and why did he rise again?
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:59.400]   What is the ultimate end and aim and goal and object of Christianity?
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:02.040]   What would be your answer to that question?
[00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:05.360]   Well the Apostle's answer, you notice, is this.
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:18.040]   He says the object, the end of it all is to bring us to a knowledge of the glory of God.
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:24.280]   Will you not agree with me that the measure of our state and sinfulness is just this?
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:30.080]   Is our failure to realize that that is the ultimate end and goal of Christianity?
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:36.000]   To bring us to a knowledge of God, the glory of God.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.280]   Do we ever think about that?
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:41.200]   Is that our instinctive way of thinking about Christianity?
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.720]   I'm afraid it isn't.
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:47.520]   We are all so subjective, aren't we?
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:54.040]   We all start with ourselves and we end with ourselves, our problem, our difficulty, our
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.040]   needs.
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:10:00.720]   And I'm afraid it's true of most of us to say that we've often even regarded God
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:04.080]   simply as a sort of agency to help us.
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:09.200]   We find ourselves in trouble, we're unhappy, we fail in our lives, we've tried this and
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.200]   we've tried that.
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:14.000]   Ah, we say, I wonder whether Christianity can help me, I wonder whether God can help
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   me.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.320]   Isn't that our approach?
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.520]   It starts with us, it ends with us.
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:26.880]   I'm at the center and I'm even prepared to make use of the Almighty God as someone
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.000]   who can help me.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   I'm at the center.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.920]   Now that's the approach so often, isn't it?
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:38.840]   And it is because that is so frequently the approach that we are what we are and we know
[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:45.120]   so little about the blessings and the glories and the joy of this Christian life.
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:48.120]   Now the Apostle Paul, you see, was entirely different.
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.760]   He glories in this.
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:55.200]   "Oh," he says, "I'm preaching for this reason, God who commanded the light to shine
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:11:01.680]   out of darkness, he's shined in my heart and he's given me the knowledge of the glory
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:04.680]   of God."
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:08.600]   And to the Apostle that was everything.
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:13.560]   He goes on in this chapter to say about the terrible troubles that were surrounding him.
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:20.320]   "If ever a man had troubles in this world, it was this Apostle Paul, persecuted, harassed,
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:24.400]   suffering from ill health, everything going against him, people letting him down."
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:28.920]   Read the rest of this chapter for yourselves and you'll see that he was a man who was
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:32.400]   literally hemmed in by troubles and trials and tribulations.
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:37.720]   But this is how he puts it, "Our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:44.640]   a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory, while we look not at the things which
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:48.620]   are seen, but at the things which are not seen.
[00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:53.800]   For the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal."
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:12:00.500]   Nothing mattered to this man, he'd now seen the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:04.320]   And that, he says, is the one thing that matters in a world like this.
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.800]   This is the gospel.
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:12.520]   It can bring us to our knowledge, the light of the knowledge of the glory of God.
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:17.440]   Well now then, why should we consider this?
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.760]   Is there somebody saying that at this moment?
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:25.560]   Are you saying to yourself, "Well, dear me, with the world as it is tonight, is that what
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:26.960]   he's going to talk about?
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.640]   The glory of God.
[00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:35.440]   With a world full of problems, with all the tensions, we hoped we'd have a word which
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:39.840]   would tell the statesmen how to act, and how to solve their problems, international and
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:41.580]   racial and continental.
[00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:46.960]   We wanted something practical, and here he's going to talk about the glory of God, remote.
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:50.560]   Something that could be done if you're unholy, and if there was no trouble in the world,
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.520]   and if everything was perfect.
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:53.960]   Are you saying that to yourself?
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:59.920]   Well, let me try and show you the unutterable folly of such a position.
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:03.520]   Why does the apostle glory in this?
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:06.880]   Well, here are his answers.
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:13.960]   This knowledge of the glory of God is man's supreme need.
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:24.880]   Now then, the knowledge of the glory of God, I repeat, is man's supreme need.
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:30.980]   Of all the needs of the human race at this minute, this is the greatest.
[00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:35.680]   How do you prove that to someone like this?
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:43.800]   It is man's ignorance of the glory of God that ultimately accounts for every single
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.800]   one of his troubles.
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.840]   Now that's a great assertion, isn't it?
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:52.720]   But I'm here to demonstrate.
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:58.040]   I am arguing that man's supreme need is to know the glory of God because it is his ignorance
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:02.600]   of that glory that accounts for the fact that he is as he is at this moment.
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:10.800]   I'm thinking of the whole state of the world, and I'm thinking of men as individual units.
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:19.520]   All unhappiness is due to this, all rivalry and jealousy due to this, all tension between
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:22.840]   nations and in the nations entirely due to this.
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:30.760]   Well, how, says someone well like this, man's real troubles arise from the fact that he
[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:33.480]   doesn't know the truth about himself.
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:38.400]   Isn't that true?
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:44.080]   What is the real ultimate cause of all distresses and the strains and the heartaches and the
[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:46.040]   unhappiness in the world this evening?
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:55.320]   Isn't it just that desire, lust, a man wanting something that doesn't belong to him, but
[00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:58.800]   he wants it, and he's determined to get it.
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:02.440]   Hence the trouble, hence the strain, it's the same between nations.
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:07.320]   Why do you have these iron curtains, bamboo curtains, and all these other curtains that
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:08.760]   we're talking so much about today?
[00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:09.760]   What's it due to?
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:15.840]   Well, you see, in the last analysis, it's all due to pride.
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:19.960]   This nation is defending what it's got, the other nation wants it.
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:22.960]   Isn't that the whole story of the human race?
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.520]   That's where you get your quarrels, that's where you get your wars.
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:29.800]   When scum walls amongst you, asks the Apostle James, answers his question by saying, even
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:33.640]   of your lusts that are in you, you desire to have, and you have not.
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:37.920]   Now, I don't care what single problem you may put before me, I can show you that it's
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:46.440]   ultimately due to the fact that men and women do not have a right view of themselves.
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:50.240]   We all set ourselves up as little gods.
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:53.720]   We set up our needs and our desires.
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:57.440]   We claim we have a right to them, unless we have them, we become angry, and we insist
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:03.960]   upon having them, and we begin to take them, hence the trouble.
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:09.080]   And I say, it's all due to this, that man doesn't realize the truth about himself.
[00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:13.120]   Man is not the center of the universe, he thinks he is.
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:19.000]   We become laws unto ourselves, we arrogate unto ourselves powers and positions, and everybody
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.920]   else does the same, hence the discord and the trouble and the confusion.
[00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:30.960]   And it's all because men is ignorant of the glory of God.
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:36.280]   You see, that's how trouble came into the world, the world was paradise until men, failing
[00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:41.200]   to realize the truth about the glory of God, rebelled against him and fell.
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:43.400]   And it's continued ever since.
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:52.240]   If only all men and women knew something about the glory of God, they would be humbled, they'd
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:58.840]   be abased, they'd cease to set themselves up as authorities, selfishness would disappear,
[00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:04.920]   we'd all be looking into the face of God and be content with acting as his servants, living
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:10.240]   a happy, harmonious life together, and all of us living to the glory of God.
[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:13.600]   But man doesn't know that.
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:19.160]   And that, I say, is the ultimate cause of all his troubles.
[00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:24.480]   It started at the fall, it has persisted ever since.
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:32.600]   Man, because he doesn't realize that he's a creature created by God, always finds himself
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:34.880]   in trouble.
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:40.000]   Because though man doesn't know it, he is utterly dependent upon God and upon God's
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   goodness.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   God made us for himself, he has made us in such a way that we can't function harmoniously
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.100]   except we're rightly related to him.
[00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:53.320]   This is the law of man's being and constitution.
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:18:00.280]   And because he is dependent upon God and upon God's blessing, if he doesn't obey God he
[00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:08.080]   loses that blessing, and the result of losing that blessing is always and invariably misery
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:09.080]   and unhappiness.
[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:13.120]   Hence, I say, the state of the world this very evening.
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:22.280]   Not only that, when man sins against God, he puts himself under the wrath of God.
[00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:26.440]   He is even under the curse of God.
[00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:32.880]   And that is the explanation of the state of the whole universe at this present time.
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:38.160]   This is how the Bible puts this, "The wicked, it says, are like the troubled sea, when it
[00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:43.500]   cannot rest, whose waters throw up mire and dirt."
[00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:46.960]   What a terrible description of the world tonight, isn't it like the troubled sea?
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:51.920]   Can't you see the churning and the motion and the movement, lashing itself, falling
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:57.000]   back, and the mud and the mire and the dirt that are thrown up, isn't it obvious everywhere?
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.920]   Look at your Sunday papers, look at the whole of life.
[00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:07.680]   You see this mud and mire, the wicked are like the troubled sea, they're under the curse
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:16.760]   of God, or as the great Saint Augustine put it, "Thou hast made us for thyself, and our
[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:22.640]   hearts are restless until they find their rest in thee."
[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:25.680]   There is no rest for man apart from God.
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:29.160]   Do what he will, and he's done so much in this century.
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:33.800]   He's never been so clever, he's never known so much, he's never multiplied his discoveries
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:34.800]   so much.
[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:37.480]   Life ought to be perfect, but it isn't.
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:38.480]   Why?
[00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:43.560]   Because man is ignorant of the glory of God.
[00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:50.160]   If only men saw God, and they'd see themselves, and all would be well.
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:54.000]   This is the essential cause of all our ills.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.280]   So when I preach on the glory of God, I'm not preaching something irrelevant, remote
[00:19:58.280 --> 00:19:59.280]   from life.
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:03.080]   It's the most urgent problem confronting the world this evening.
[00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:07.520]   It's the only hope.
[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:11.520]   But let me give you a second reason for considering this question of the knowledge of the glory
[00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:14.680]   of God.
[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:19.760]   And it's a very alarming one, but it's very true.
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:31.000]   Ignorance of the glory of God will be the cause of men's final condemnation.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:38.300]   You know, this is why the Apostle Paul had renounced the hidden things of dishonesty.
[00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:43.680]   This is why he was so desperately serious and urgent.
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:49.960]   He knew that everybody at the end would have to stand in the presence of God and to be
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:50.960]   examined.
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:54.480]   And on what shall we be examined?
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:59.440]   What is man going to be examined on when he dies and stands before God?
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:07.440]   And the answer is this, his knowledge of the glory of God.
[00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:08.440]   Where do I find that?
[00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:10.400]   Well, listen to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:15.960]   A clever man came to him one day with one of the trick-catch questions and said, "Good
[00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:22.840]   master, which is the first and the greatest commandment of the law?"
[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:27.640]   And our Lord looked at him and said, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:32.000]   and all thy soul, and all thy mind and all thy strength.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.420]   That is the first and the chiefest commandment."
[00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:43.320]   You see, the Jews had got 613 rules and regulations in their law, and they were arguing about
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:45.840]   them, which was the greatest, this ought to be done, that ought to be done.
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:52.360]   Christ says, "Here's the first, love God with the whole of your being."
[00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:57.240]   And you do that because of the glory of God.
[00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:04.600]   The chief end of man is to glorify God and to enjoy him forever.
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:06.040]   Why did man ever make God?
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:07.560]   Here's the answer.
[00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:11.400]   God made man in order that he might glorify himself through man.
[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:13.920]   Man was made to glorify God.
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:17.240]   God made him the Lord of creation, put everything under his hand.
[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:18.240]   Why?
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:20.560]   Well, because he'd made him in his own image.
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:29.520]   Man was meant to be a kind of reflection of God, to minister to the glory of God.
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:33.720]   And therefore I say that every one of us will be judged at the end as to whether we have
[00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:36.720]   glorified God or whether we've not.
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:40.800]   Let me put it as simply and as plainly as I can, my dear friend, you will not be asked
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:44.880]   in the day of judgment how many times you got drunk, how many times you smoked or did
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:45.880]   this or that.
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:52.540]   But you will be asked, "Have you lived to the glory of God?
[00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:56.880]   Was your life governed by God's glory?"
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:05.560]   That is the very one question that will confront us all in the final judgment.
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:09.000]   I must go on repeating this because we are given the impression that Christianity is
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.080]   everything else.
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:14.440]   You will not be asked, you know, your views on the racial question or on any one of these
[00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:15.440]   questions.
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:22.400]   You will be asked as to whether you have lived to the glory of God, whether that governed
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:26.320]   your whole life and you lived for him.
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:32.320]   He demands that because he has made us for himself and he expects us to live to his glory.
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:37.200]   So I'm arguing there's nothing so urgent for us this evening as to know something about
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:42.640]   the knowledge of the glory of God.
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:46.760]   Bonds may burst or bonds may not be used.
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:50.440]   There may be another world war, there may not be another world war, but we've all got
[00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:51.760]   to die.
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:57.600]   And at the end we stand before God and here's the only question, "Did you know God's glory?
[00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:58.600]   Were you governed by it?
[00:23:58.600 --> 00:23:59.960]   Did you live for it?
[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:03.560]   Was this the thing that was there over and above you always?
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:08.320]   You were made for this?"
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:12.280]   That's why the apostle glories in this gospel.
[00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:19.640]   It has given him the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:25.320]   But thank God I go on to this other point, which is this.
[00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:30.560]   This is the only knowledge that can deliver man out of his troubles and predicament.
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:31.560]   It follows of necessity.
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:34.120]   I needn't stay with this.
[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:38.720]   If man's troubles are due to his ignorance of the glory of God, well, the knowledge of
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:44.160]   the glory of God will solve his problems.
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:50.720]   And if only all men and women bowed down before God this night and worshipped him and said,
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:55.600]   "Lord, lead us, guide us, we are ready to listen to thy commandments," you know all
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:58.240]   the problems would be solved.
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:01.540]   There'd be no need for these people to march backwards and forwards.
[00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:03.760]   There'd be no need for these people to make their protests.
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:05.460]   There'd be no threat of war.
[00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:07.000]   You could abolish your law courts.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.520]   You wouldn't need anything at all.
[00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:10.120]   You could banish your police force.
[00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:15.840]   If only everybody went down and said, "God, I want to keep thy commandments, enable me
[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:19.640]   to the knowledge of the glory of God," it solves the problems.
[00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:20.640]   It delivers.
[00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:23.400]   Isn't that the message of the Bible?
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:32.560]   The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and isn't the modern world proving that?
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:35.960]   Our statesmen are wise men, yes, but they can't solve the problems.
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:36.960]   Why?
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:40.720]   You say they can give us education, they can spend millions on schools, that's surely
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:41.720]   going to solve it.
[00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:45.360]   If only everybody's educated, nobody will ever steal again, nobody will ever get drunk
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:48.540]   again, nobody will ever commit murder again, there'll be no more divorce if people are
[00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:49.540]   only educated.
[00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:51.120]   Do you really believe that?
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:54.640]   Of course you don't.
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:26:01.880]   The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:07.040]   And it doesn't matter what you know and what you don't know, if you don't know this, it
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:09.320]   won't deliver you.
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:17.600]   The world is as it is because of this ignorance, and this is the only knowledge that can deliver
[00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:19.640]   men.
[00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:25.240]   Now the apostle, of course, had experienced this himself.
[00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:30.800]   He'd known the restlessness of that old pharisaical life.
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:36.120]   He'd known the failure and the fear of it all, but once he'd seen this.
[00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:38.240]   He was a new man.
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:39.840]   His problems were solved.
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:44.760]   He's reminded these Corinthians already in the first epistle of the same thing.
[00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:48.560]   He's got a terrible statement there in the sixth chapter of the first epistle.
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:54.600]   He puts it very plainly, listen to this, "Be not deceived," he says, "neither fornicators
[00:26:54.600 --> 00:27:00.960]   nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:05.560]   thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit
[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:06.840]   the kingdom of God.
[00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:18.000]   And such were some of you, but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:23.160]   in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God."
[00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:26.600]   You see, this town of Corinth was a very cosmopolitan town.
[00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:32.680]   It was a seaport town, with all the characteristics of such a town, a kind of great mercantile
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:33.680]   city.
[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:37.440]   People came from all countries, different languages, different races, and there they
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:39.660]   all mixed, and the vice and the evil.
[00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:40.660]   It was horrible.
[00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:41.660]   There he describes it.
[00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:47.020]   "Such," he says, "were some of you, but they're no longer that.
[00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:48.020]   They were that.
[00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:49.320]   They are no longer that."
[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:50.320]   Why?
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:51.320]   Well, they've been washed.
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:52.320]   They've been sanctified.
[00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:53.320]   They've been justified.
[00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:58.280]   They've had this knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:04.240]   My dear friends, there is nothing on earth tonight that can solve the moral, the ethical,
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:10.440]   the political, the social problem save this blessed gospel, this knowledge of the glory
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:11.440]   of God.
[00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:14.600]   That's why we should consider it.
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:15.600]   But wait a minute.
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:19.040]   Let me take a second point.
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:26.080]   The Apostle not only tells us that this knowledge is our greatest need, he tells us that there's
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:32.480]   only one way whereby we can arrive at this knowledge.
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:35.600]   And this is essentially important again.
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:42.520]   There's only one way, really, to know the glory of God.
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:43.520]   What is it?
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:49.000]   Well, there are many partial ways in which we can arrive at bits of information about
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.080]   God.
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:57.440]   Any man who reasons truly must believe in God.
[00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:00.080]   You can't explain the universe apart from God.
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:01.080]   It's not accident.
[00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:03.200]   It can't be.
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:09.240]   All the delicacy and the subtlety and balance of life, this can't be the result of accident.
[00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:12.520]   Reason should bring a man to believe in God.
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:14.760]   The great medieval philosophers worked it out.
[00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:16.780]   You can read it for yourselves.
[00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:19.220]   I accept their arguments as far as they go.
[00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:23.440]   They bring us to a belief in an absolute.
[00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:27.040]   The study of nature does the same thing.
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:33.120]   The order, the design, the arrangement, it all should lead us to believe in God.
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:38.940]   Likewise, history should lead us in the same direction.
[00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:47.920]   But all these at their very best and highest will never bring us to a true knowledge of
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:50.640]   the glory of God.
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:54.000]   They'll tell us about God as the creator.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.120]   They will tell us something about the power of God, but that isn't the essential glory
[00:29:58.120 --> 00:29:59.120]   of God.
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:06.840]   No, no, it is still true to say that no man hath seen God at any time.
[00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:09.820]   God dwelleth in a light that is unapproachable.
[00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:12.200]   No man can see God and live.
[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:17.200]   Listen to the Apostle's description of him in writing to Timothy, "Who only hath immortality
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:24.640]   dwelling in the light which no man can approach, whom no man hath seen nor can see, to whom
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:27.880]   be glory and power everlasting.
[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:29.300]   Amen."
[00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:32.600]   The glory of God.
[00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:37.720]   Man is too sinful, he's too small, he's too weak.
[00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:40.640]   He marvels at the power of an atom.
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:44.440]   He's astonished at the light of the flesh.
[00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:53.560]   But multiply that by infinity and there you have some dim conception of the glory of the
[00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:56.540]   everlasting God.
[00:30:56.540 --> 00:31:00.280]   And men by seeking cannot find God.
[00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:02.520]   He's tried to throughout the centuries.
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:07.520]   Your Greek philosophers have tried it, but the Apostle says the world by wisdom, by philosophy,
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:08.640]   knew not God.
[00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:09.960]   You can't get there.
[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:13.380]   You can find a creator, a master mind behind the universe.
[00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:14.960]   You can see some source of power.
[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:20.760]   Yes, but you don't know God, God in all his ultimate glory.
[00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:21.760]   Man cannot get there.
[00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:24.800]   He's weak, he's fallible, he's sinful, he's frail.
[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:28.480]   He can't stand the sight.
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:33.360]   The Apostle has already been working out this argument.
[00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:40.260]   In the previous chapter, he has reminded these people of what happened on one occasion when
[00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:44.800]   Moses the servant of God went up onto the mount to meet with God and to have the Ten
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:47.880]   Commandments.
[00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:48.880]   And you remember the story.
[00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:52.240]   Moses came down and the people were expecting him.
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:54.640]   And they saw him coming and they rushed forward to meet him.
[00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:57.720]   Suddenly they saw him and they fell back in terror and alarm.
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:01.200]   Oh, it was the brightness of his face.
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:07.800]   Moses' face was shining and they couldn't stand the sight.
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:09.940]   Why was his face shining?
[00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:13.120]   Because he'd been in the presence of God.
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:16.640]   Something of the light of the glory of God was on the face of Moses and it was too much
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:17.640]   for the people.
[00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:20.200]   Moses had to put on a veil.
[00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:21.800]   They fell back in terror.
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:23.880]   Just the reflection on the face of Moses.
[00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:25.480]   Well, what of the thing itself?
[00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:28.280]   Well, you see, it's utterly impossible.
[00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:30.960]   Man can never attain unto this.
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:33.160]   No, no.
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:39.520]   There is only one way whereby we can ever come to the knowledge of the glory of God.
[00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:43.000]   And it is the way in which the Apostle tells us.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:53.880]   The light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:57.240]   Here it is, the glory of Christ.
[00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:59.640]   He is the only begotten of the Father.
[00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:04.120]   We beheld his glory, says John, full of grace and truth.
[00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:08.500]   Here is one who can say, "I am the way, the truth, and the life.
[00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:11.000]   No man cometh unto the Father but by me.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:16.760]   You'll arrive at the Creator at a great mind, but the Father, no, no, only in me.
[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:22.800]   He who hath seen me hath seen the Father.
[00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:26.840]   He is the express image of his person, the brightness of God's glory.
[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:32.320]   God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time, passed unto the Fathers by
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:37.360]   the Prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son.
[00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:45.080]   Here he is, in the face of Jesus Christ, the only way to see the glory of God.
[00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:52.080]   Well, that brings me to my third and my last point, which is this.
[00:33:52.080 --> 00:34:01.960]   What is this knowledge that we have of God's glory in the face of Jesus Christ?
[00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:07.000]   What is this thing that thrilled this great apostle?
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:12.760]   What is this knowledge that makes him feel ready to give his life to lay it down in order
[00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:14.800]   that men may have this knowledge?
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:18.520]   What is it?
[00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:27.000]   What is this knowledge of the glory of God, which we obtain alone in the Lord Jesus Christ?
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.720]   You see, God is essentially glory.
[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:33.720]   We can't conceive of God.
[00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:35.040]   God is absolute.
[00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:37.320]   God is eternal.
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:38.320]   God is infinite.
[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:40.400]   God is everywhere, omnipresent.
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:42.160]   He is omniscient.
[00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:47.840]   All his attributes are eternal and absolute.
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:53.880]   But what shines out in every attribute of God is his glory.
[00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:55.320]   What does it mean?
[00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:59.400]   Well, look at it for a moment.
[00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:07.520]   As you see it in his holiness, it is in and through the Lord Jesus Christ we rarely get
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:14.440]   a true conception of the holiness of God.
[00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:18.960]   What do we know about the holiness of God, my friends?
[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:23.960]   Do we understand why the children of Israel were not allowed to touch that holy mount
[00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:26.720]   on which the commandments were given to them?
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:31.600]   Do you understand why it was that a man like Isaiah, when he had his vision of God, said,
[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:33.000]   "Woe is unto me.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   I am undone.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.820]   I am a man of unclean lips"?
[00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:42.760]   Why was it, when John had his vision of the Lord Jesus Christ on Patmos, that he fell
[00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:44.480]   down as one dead?
[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:49.200]   What made Paul himself fall on the road to Damascus, helpless on his back when he looked
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:50.480]   into the face of Christ?
[00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:51.480]   What is this?
[00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:55.800]   Well, this is the glory of the holiness of God.
[00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:57.480]   Where do you see it in Christ?
[00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:01.960]   Well, look at it in his holy life.
[00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:06.240]   Here is one who never sinned.
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:11.280]   Here is one who never did any wrong at all.
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:14.300]   You and I can't live a day without committing sin.
[00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:19.280]   Here is one who never sinned, tempted in all points like as we are, yet without sin.
[00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:22.400]   Look at his holy, spotless, pure life.
[00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:26.700]   No evil, nothing wrong.
[00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:36.400]   But remember he subjected himself to God's law, made of a woman, made under the law.
[00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:39.440]   Don't you see the holiness of God there?
[00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:41.960]   Why does the Son of God submit himself to the law?
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:47.960]   Well, it is in order to show the holiness of God and of his law.
[00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:52.880]   Have you ever noticed our Lord's teaching about God?
[00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:54.800]   Have you ever noticed how he prays?
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:57.000]   This is how he teaches men to pray.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:04.280]   "Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name."
[00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:07.200]   "Hallowed be thy name."
[00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:08.720]   Listen to him praying himself.
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:09.720]   How does he pray?
[00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:10.720]   What does he say?
[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:11.720]   Does he say, "Dear Father?"
[00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:12.720]   No, no.
[00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:13.720]   Does he say, "Dear God?"
[00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:14.720]   Certainly not.
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:20.560]   He says, "Holy Father, the holiness of God."
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:23.560]   You only see it in the face of Jesus Christ, truly.
[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:27.960]   It is as you look at him, you see the glory of the holiness of God.
[00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:31.820]   But what am I speaking of?
[00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:39.780]   Look at this Jesus of Nazareth, crucified upon a cross on Calvary's Hill.
[00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:42.300]   What is he doing there?
[00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:44.940]   Why is he there?
[00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:45.940]   What ever took him there?
[00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:46.940]   He's never sinned.
[00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:48.300]   He's done no wrong.
[00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:50.560]   Why is he there?
[00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:53.940]   And you know, there's only one answer to that question.
[00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:59.180]   It is because of the holiness of God.
[00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:03.620]   God is of such a pure countenance that he cannot look upon sin.
[00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:07.660]   God is light and in him is no darkness at all.
[00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:11.900]   Nothing which is sinful can dwell in the presence of God.
[00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:15.860]   And all men are sinful, and therefore all men are incapable of being in the presence
[00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:16.860]   of God.
[00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:17.860]   What's he doing there?
[00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:23.360]   I say he's there because of the holiness of God, this holiness which is intolerant
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:29.940]   of sin, which must punish sin, and which does punish sin.
[00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:35.580]   The Son of God is on that cross on Calvary because your sins and mine are being punished
[00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:36.580]   there.
[00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:42.560]   The holiness of God, the justice of God, the righteousness of God is proclaiming itself.
[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:48.380]   The glory of God in his holiness is seen in the face of Jesus Christ upon the cross on
[00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:51.220]   Calvary's Hill.
[00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:54.420]   You won't see that anywhere else.
[00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:59.260]   The Ten Commandments tell us about the holiness of God.
[00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:04.220]   They tell us about his hatred of sin, many other teachings do.
[00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:09.820]   But if you really want to know something about the holiness of God, you must go to Calvary
[00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:12.460]   and there you'll see it.
[00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:20.060]   The holiness is such that sin must be punished, and even in his only Son.
[00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:25.380]   Such is the God before whom we stand at this moment, and before whom we'll all have to
[00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:28.700]   stand in the Last Judgment.
[00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:35.020]   But look at it for a moment in terms of how we see the wisdom of God, the glory of God
[00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:42.260]   in his wisdom, in the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:47.260]   We can tell something about the wisdom of God from creation and from nature.
[00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:49.320]   Have you ever noticed God's handiwork?
[00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:51.940]   Have you ever noticed the pattern of these flowers?
[00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:57.100]   You can dissect them, pull off the petals, look at the stamens, everything arranged perfectly.
[00:39:57.100 --> 00:39:58.100]   What a mind!
[00:39:58.100 --> 00:40:01.700]   It's the mind of the Creator, it's the mind of God.
[00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:05.980]   Look at it, spring, summer, autumn, winter.
[00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:10.540]   Look at it in the sun, look at it in the moon, the stars, the way in which the world turns
[00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:13.300]   round, moves in its orbit round the sun.
[00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:15.580]   What a mind!
[00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:22.060]   The mind of the great planner of the universe, God, the everlasting Creator and the sustainer
[00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:24.540]   and the organiser of the whole of life.
[00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:27.580]   "Ah," you say, "there is the wisdom of God."
[00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:37.220]   I agree, but you know that's only a very partial glimpse into the wisdom of God.
[00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:45.060]   If you really want to know the wisdom of God, you've got to look into the face of Jesus
[00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:46.060]   Christ.
[00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:47.060]   Why?
[00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:49.860]   Well, for this reason.
[00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:58.500]   Here is the problem confronting the Almighty God in his wisdom.
[00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:10.300]   How can he forgive sinful men and receive them unto himself and still remain the holy
[00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:12.940]   God that he is?
[00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:15.940]   Have you ever thought of that problem?
[00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:18.580]   That's the problem.
[00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:24.960]   God is utterly holy, he is righteous, he is pure, he is just.
[00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:28.780]   How can he forgive men?
[00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:33.020]   How can he receive men unto himself?
[00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:39.940]   And here is the astounding thing, which you only see in the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:47.020]   God, in his everlasting wisdom and the glory of his wisdom, has evolved a plan and a scheme
[00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:55.020]   whereby to do this impossible thing, and the way is the way that is depicted in the Gospel.
[00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:59.900]   He planned it before the world, and this is the plan.
[00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:10.300]   He will send his only begotten Son into the world, he'll give him a human nature, he'll
[00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:16.460]   get him to be born as a babe out of the womb of a woman called Mary.
[00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:20.300]   Humanity's gone wrong, humanity's sinful, humanity's under the curse.
[00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:21.300]   How to save it?
[00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:22.300]   There's only one way.
[00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:25.020]   There must be a new humanity.
[00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:33.660]   So God, who made the first Adam, creates in his own Son a second Adam, a second man.
[00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:37.900]   Here is one who's not born out of natural wedlock, here is one who doesn't descend as
[00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:39.060]   everybody else.
[00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:44.860]   He's a miracle, he's born of a virgin, he's made, he's made and given a new humanity,
[00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:47.300]   he starts off a new race of men.
[00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:58.900]   God sends his own Son, and then having sent the Son, the Son becomes responsible for us
[00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:05.540]   and our sins, and the Father lays our sins upon him.
[00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:09.260]   And as I've told you, he deals with them there, he punishes him for us.
[00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:15.420]   Here's the way of God, sin must be punished, well he does punish it in his Son, and because
[00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:22.060]   the Son is God, he's too big to be killed by it, he rises, having borne the punishment.
[00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:29.060]   God is just and the justifier of him that believeth in Jesus.
[00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:34.460]   God has found the way to reconcile men unto himself.
[00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:42.700]   How to forgive us our trespasses, how to make us his children, this is the wisdom of God.
[00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:47.340]   Men couldn't think of it, man was trying to save himself and couldn't and failed.
[00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:52.540]   God sends it in Christ, here is the wisdom of God in the face of Jesus Christ, the plan
[00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:55.340]   of salvation, the new humanity.
[00:43:55.340 --> 00:43:58.940]   Those who believe in Christ are delivered, they're forgiven, they're introduced into
[00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:03.940]   Christ, they become members of a new kingdom, and it's going on and on and on, the wisdom
[00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:11.260]   of God, the glory of God's wisdom, in the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:16.620]   You don't see it anywhere else, and the apostle, this apostle Paul tells us in writing to the
[00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:22.020]   Ephesians, that it is through men and women like us who are in the church, that God is
[00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:27.820]   at the end going to show his manifold wisdom, even to the principalities and powers in the
[00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:29.620]   heavenly places.
[00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:37.620]   Oh, the wisdom of God in the face of Jesus Christ, then think of his love for a moment.
[00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:43.420]   People think they know all about the love of God, but my dear friend, you know nothing
[00:44:43.420 --> 00:44:49.660]   about the glory of God's love until you see it in the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:44:49.660 --> 00:45:04.860]   Oh, well, I've already told you, this is love, that God so loved the world that he gave his
[00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:14.780]   only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting
[00:45:14.780 --> 00:45:18.540]   life.
[00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:22.780]   You know nothing about the love of God unless you know that.
[00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:25.580]   This is the measure of God's love.
[00:45:25.580 --> 00:45:29.900]   This is the glory of God's love, not that he says, "I'll forgive you and pretend I haven't
[00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:30.900]   seen it."
[00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:32.500]   That's what you think of God's love, isn't it?
[00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:37.260]   You think that God is like ourselves, "Ah, it's all right, pretend I haven't seen it,
[00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:39.900]   God can't do that, God is holy and just and righteous."
[00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:42.500]   No, no, that's not God's love.
[00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:54.300]   This is love, that God sent his only Son into this evil, sinful world.
[00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:56.220]   He lived a life here.
[00:45:56.220 --> 00:46:00.580]   He endured the contradiction of sinners against himself.
[00:46:00.580 --> 00:46:07.180]   He went to that cross and God the Father put on him our iniquities.
[00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:13.660]   God on his own innocent loving Son put your sins and mine and punished him for you.
[00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:18.020]   Rebel, sinner as you are, he did that for you.
[00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:21.640]   That's the love of God.
[00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:26.060]   And if you don't see that, you've never seen the love of God.
[00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:30.380]   It is there the love of God shines out in all its glory.
[00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:35.620]   In the face of Jesus Christ, Paul saw it, you see, on the road to Damascus, the Son
[00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:41.700]   of God who loved me and who gave himself for me, he says, "Oh, the glory of God that should
[00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:44.460]   have done that for me."
[00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:46.820]   That's why he preaches it.
[00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:54.060]   The glory of God in his love is only seen in the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:59.560]   God did that that you and I might be forgiven, that we might be reconciled, that we might
[00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:01.540]   become the children of God.
[00:47:01.540 --> 00:47:08.500]   And I end with a last word about the power of God, the glory of God's power, as again
[00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:13.020]   seen only in the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:47:13.020 --> 00:47:14.020]   What do I mean?
[00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:15.020]   Well, I mean this.
[00:47:15.020 --> 00:47:21.480]   Oh, it was a wonderful thing that God did at the beginning when he said, "Let there
[00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:22.480]   be light."
[00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:23.820]   And there was light.
[00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:32.500]   What power, out of the chaos to produce order, with a mere word of a fiat, "Let there be
[00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:36.620]   light," and there was light, that's power.
[00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:40.380]   He just says, "He spake," and it is done.
[00:47:40.380 --> 00:47:42.380]   That's tremendous power.
[00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:47.460]   But you know, we know nothing about the glory of God's power unless and except we look at
[00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:50.780]   it again in the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:47:50.780 --> 00:47:53.540]   I like always to listen to the thunder.
[00:47:53.540 --> 00:47:57.980]   It tells me about the power of God, the flash of the lightning, the power of God.
[00:47:57.980 --> 00:47:59.220]   He holds it all.
[00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:01.180]   He plays with the whole cosmos.
[00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:02.180]   That's God's power.
[00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:09.980]   But, oh, that's nothing in contrast with what we find in the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:48:09.980 --> 00:48:14.300]   Go back again and look at their birth.
[00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:17.620]   There's a mighty miracle.
[00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:24.740]   It was infinitely more difficult than creating the world to send his son as the babe of Bethlehem.
[00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:27.340]   The virgin birth, the glorious miracle.
[00:48:27.340 --> 00:48:31.940]   It's not surprising the angels sang the power of God in the birth of his son.
[00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:34.140]   Then look at the miracles of Jesus Christ.
[00:48:34.140 --> 00:48:36.420]   The blind receive their sight, the lame walk.
[00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:38.780]   The lepers are cleansed, the deaf are made to hear.
[00:48:38.780 --> 00:48:41.380]   The lame leap, the dead are raised.
[00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:43.060]   "Who's this?" said everybody.
[00:48:43.060 --> 00:48:44.860]   "Read your Gospels.
[00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:45.860]   Listen to the people."
[00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:48.260]   They said, "We have seen strange things today."
[00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:49.740]   They said, "Who is this?
[00:48:49.740 --> 00:48:54.620]   Who is this that can command the raging of the sea and silence the howling of the gale?
[00:48:54.620 --> 00:48:58.420]   Who is this?"
[00:48:58.420 --> 00:49:00.180]   He was a puzzle and a problem.
[00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:07.540]   His power, the multiplicity of his miracles, there was no end to his power, dead and raising.
[00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:10.060]   It's the power of God again.
[00:49:10.060 --> 00:49:12.460]   The world has never seen anybody like him.
[00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:13.720]   He stands alone.
[00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:15.020]   He's quite unique.
[00:49:15.020 --> 00:49:21.060]   His miraculous power is a manifestation of the glory of God's power.
[00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:25.820]   But you know, that isn't where you rarely see the glory of the power of God.
[00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:27.340]   Where, then?
[00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:33.260]   Oh, it's in the mighty and the glorious resurrection.
[00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:43.940]   There he is, nailed to the tree, dies in apparent weakness, and the mob is shouting and jeering
[00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:49.540]   and laughing, "Ah, thou that settest thou us, the Son of God, if thou be the Son of
[00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:53.780]   God, come down, save thyself, show your power."
[00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:59.220]   But he dies in weakness, he's buried, there he is in a grave, stone is rolled on the face
[00:49:59.220 --> 00:50:08.700]   of the grave, finished, end, soldiers guarding it, but suddenly, an empty grave, he's risen,
[00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:14.820]   cursed asunder, the bench of death, he's risen triumphant, o'er the grave, watch this, this
[00:50:14.820 --> 00:50:23.540]   is the power of God, conquering death and hell, Hades, the grave, and Satan, principalities
[00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:29.500]   and powers, being put to an open shame.
[00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:37.740]   It's there you see the power of God, in the face of the risen Christ, the last enemy that
[00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:41.220]   shall be conquered is death.
[00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:46.820]   Nobody can conquer death, all your great patriarchs, they had to die, all your great captains and
[00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:51.660]   kings, they're all dead, all your brilliant scientists, split the atom, control power,
[00:50:51.660 --> 00:50:57.300]   they've all got to die, death, the last enemy, no one can stand up to death, here is one
[00:50:57.300 --> 00:51:02.900]   who's conquered it, and conquered the devil at the same time, the mightiest power in the
[00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:08.900]   universe, next to God himself, defeated, and the power is seen, the glory of the power
[00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:17.700]   is evident, in the face of the risen Christ, and as a result of that, he can even give
[00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:24.860]   us new life, he can come to a man who's the most besotted sinner in the land, yes, guilty
[00:51:24.860 --> 00:51:30.180]   of all the things that Paul has mentioned in 1 Corinthians 6, 9, effeminate abusers
[00:51:30.180 --> 00:51:35.300]   of themselves with mankind, men who are slaves to drink and passions, and every evil, have
[00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:40.200]   lost their everything, and can lift them up, and put new life and power into them.
[00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:44.740]   This is the power of God, in the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:50.980]   But wait a minute, there is more to come.
[00:51:50.980 --> 00:51:56.700]   This Christ who has conquered death in the grave, ascended into heaven, and there he
[00:51:56.700 --> 00:52:03.740]   is, seated at the right hand of God, waiting until his enemies shall be made his footstool.
[00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:07.980]   And they're going to be made his footstool.
[00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:09.980]   You want me to talk about communism?
[00:52:09.980 --> 00:52:13.140]   Well, I'll tell you something about it.
[00:52:13.140 --> 00:52:16.900]   You want me to talk about science?
[00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:21.800]   You want me to talk about great world powers, and armies, and bombs?
[00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:27.500]   You want very well, I'll answer your request.
[00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:35.060]   They're all going to be destroyed, every one of them.
[00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:41.740]   Every great power that has ever raised itself against this Christ has been humbled, destroyed,
[00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:42.740]   and removed.
[00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:47.180]   It doesn't matter what it is, nor who it is.
[00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:56.140]   Any power that doesn't give God the glory is going down, down to defeat, down to extinction.
[00:52:56.140 --> 00:52:59.420]   And they're all going to be conquered.
[00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:05.860]   This same Christ is going to come back, conquering and to conquer.
[00:53:05.860 --> 00:53:09.660]   He's already defeated the devil, he's going to destroy him finally.
[00:53:09.660 --> 00:53:14.960]   And everybody who belongs to him, read when you go home, the 17th chapter of the book
[00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:20.020]   of Revelation, and there you'll find kings, and queens, and princes, and merchants, and
[00:53:20.020 --> 00:53:24.020]   nations, all who followed the devil, they're all going to be destroyed.
[00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:29.340]   Babylon the Great is fallen, is fallen.
[00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:34.180]   Hell and death and everything are going to be cast into the lake of fire and finally
[00:53:34.180 --> 00:53:35.180]   destroyed.
[00:53:35.180 --> 00:53:41.900]   The power of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:53:41.900 --> 00:53:47.100]   Christ will come back to the world and destroy his every enemy.
[00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:53.180]   He'll destroy evil in its every shape and form.
[00:53:53.180 --> 00:53:58.780]   There is going to be a new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness.
[00:53:58.780 --> 00:54:04.860]   And the kingdom of God and of Christ shall be complete, and all outside it go to everlasting
[00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:07.660]   destruction.
[00:54:07.660 --> 00:54:10.420]   What a wonderful picture.
[00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:14.260]   What a glorious vision this is.
[00:54:14.260 --> 00:54:16.300]   Why is Christ doing all this?
[00:54:16.300 --> 00:54:17.740]   Well, this is the end.
[00:54:17.740 --> 00:54:19.980]   It is all to the glory of God.
[00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:26.340]   And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject
[00:54:26.340 --> 00:54:34.740]   unto him that put all things unto him, that God may be all in all.
[00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:40.020]   The power that is in Christ is going to bring in this everlasting kingdom, and when he's
[00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:49.500]   brought it in, he will hand it back to the Father, that God may be all and in all.
[00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:57.340]   And even the Son of God, our blessed Savior, shall hand everything unto him.
[00:54:57.340 --> 00:55:07.580]   And the Son, even the Son himself, shall be subject unto him.
[00:55:07.580 --> 00:55:11.700]   That's the object of the gospel, to bring us to that knowledge.
[00:55:11.700 --> 00:55:14.980]   Did you know these things?
[00:55:14.980 --> 00:55:17.860]   Had you seen these things?
[00:55:17.860 --> 00:55:22.500]   Are you living your life in the light of these things?
[00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:27.020]   Tell me, what do you see tonight?
[00:55:27.020 --> 00:55:31.020]   You only see the nightlife of London?
[00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:35.620]   You only see the Commonwealth Conference that's about to be held?
[00:55:35.620 --> 00:55:40.900]   Do you only see the struggle between America and Russia and China?
[00:55:40.900 --> 00:55:43.220]   What are you really seeing?
[00:55:43.220 --> 00:55:44.980]   What's your view of life?
[00:55:44.980 --> 00:55:52.380]   Here's the only sane view of life, the glory of God.
[00:55:52.380 --> 00:55:55.620]   All these other things are going to disappear.
[00:55:55.620 --> 00:56:00.820]   All the kingdoms and all their glory shall become the kingdoms of our God and of his
[00:56:00.820 --> 00:56:01.820]   Christ.
[00:56:01.820 --> 00:56:03.500]   But you say, "I'm living in the world."
[00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:04.500]   No, I know you are.
[00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:05.980]   You can do nothing about it, you know.
[00:56:05.980 --> 00:56:07.580]   This is what's going to happen.
[00:56:07.580 --> 00:56:11.780]   The one thing that matters for you and for me is this, where am I going to be when that
[00:56:11.780 --> 00:56:15.260]   glorious day comes?
[00:56:15.260 --> 00:56:18.220]   That's the one thing that matters.
[00:56:18.220 --> 00:56:26.900]   Have you seen tonight that your supreme and greatest need is to have the light of the
[00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:31.940]   knowledge of the glory of God?
[00:56:31.940 --> 00:56:34.340]   You can have it if you want it.
[00:56:34.340 --> 00:56:43.500]   Turn to Jesus Christ, ask him to show it to you, plead with him, go to him in your helplessness,
[00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:47.540]   in your ignorance, say, "Oh, give me a glimpse of this."
[00:56:47.540 --> 00:56:55.620]   Shine into my heart, Holy Spirit, truth divine, dawn upon this soul of mine, word of God and
[00:56:55.620 --> 00:56:56.620]   inward light.
[00:56:56.620 --> 00:57:00.420]   Clear my spirit, clear my sight.
[00:57:00.420 --> 00:57:02.860]   Ask him to do it.
[00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:12.380]   Ask him to shine into your heart, revealing this glory of God in this manifold manner,
[00:57:12.380 --> 00:57:16.420]   in the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:57:16.420 --> 00:57:18.120]   Amen.
