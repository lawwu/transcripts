[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.580]   Christmas will be here in a couple of days and this is the season when I'm reminded of a powerful line from John Donne the
[00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.740]   17th century poet and pastor in his Christmas Day sermon way back in
[00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.400]   1626 he said this quote
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.360]   Christ's birth and his death were but one
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:23.500]   Continual act and his Christmas Day and his Good Friday are but the evening and morning of one and the same day
[00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.320]   end quote
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.320]   There's a sobriety about Bethlehem
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:35.400]   Even there within the text with the slaughter of the innocents all the early signals tell us that the birth of Jesus is not all glee
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.480]   And joy, but it will be a story tinged from the very beginning
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.200]   with sacrifice and bloodshed
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:48.960]   In fact the meaning of Christ's birth will not make sense unless we see how deeply the incarnation is embedded
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:56.640]   Within a grand storyline of atonement and sacrifice in the Bible story from Genesis to Revelation
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:03.240]   So on occasional Fridays, I call dr. Don Carson Carson is the co-founder and president of the gospel coalition
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.760]   And he's also the editor of the NIV's under Vince study Bible man
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.080]   He takes up a theme in biblical theology for us on those occasional Fridays
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.920]   And it just so happens that today in the shadow of Christmas. We are talking about sacrifice
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.560]   Here's dr. Carson to explain
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.680]   One might think that in western
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.360]   secular
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:31.600]   Thought the notion of sacrifice and especially blood sacrifice sounds primitive and obsolete
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.240]   Something that doesn't make any sense anymore
[00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:43.560]   But the notion of sacrifice is enduring in every culture in one fashion or another we admire the sacrifices for example of
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.000]   our soldiers who
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.200]   Perhaps sacrifice themselves in order to save a batch of their mates for that. We give the Medal of Honor posthumously and
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.120]   Honor their sacrifice. I remember when I was a high school student reading a story
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.320]   I was brought up in French it was by a French writer called Gui de Montpassant
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.320]   Concerning this
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.640]   couple
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.760]   childless deeply deeply in love
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:15.480]   Long married she had gorgeous gorgeous long hair and they were dirt poor
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.200]   She would have really liked a certain silver clasp that she had
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.520]   her eye on to
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.880]   to
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:29.240]   Set off the hair and hold it together and so on and he for his part no less poor both of them hard-working
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:34.240]   But with barely enough money to survive he had inherited his grandfather's
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:40.360]   watch and he would have dearly dearly loved to have a silver chain to
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.480]   Wear the wrong watch it was a pocket watch and he wanted a silver chain
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.960]   But of course neither of them could could afford what they wanted and then that Christmas
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:57.560]   She cut off her hair which could be used for a variety of things a century and a half ago and earned enough money
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.360]   To buy him a silver chain
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.600]   And he sold the watch in order to buy her a clasp for her hair
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.960]   And that's all of the story was but in in both cases. There was a an image of sacrifice
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:16.520]   Out of love for the other person and in this case there was irony built into it of course
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.360]   so we are moved by stories of sacrifice and
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:27.400]   We need to become aware of how sacrifice works as a theme in all of the Bible and finally brings us to the cross
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.600]   the first possible mention of
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.480]   sacrifice in the Bible is in Genesis 321
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:40.440]   Where God chooses to cover Adam and Eve to cover their nakedness by selecting the skins of animals
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.480]   He could have used something else they had used fig leaves
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:50.480]   Now there's no specific mention that this was an atonement for sin or the like there's no way that one should read back
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:58.560]   complex later sacrificial theology into Genesis 321, but you stick it on a trajectory and it's
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:04.000]   Seminal it's a covering that involves the death of another creature
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.880]   And that's the first mention of that sort of thing
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.000]   It prefigures as it were
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.320]   The sacrifices that are still to be unpacked
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:23.160]   then there are many many sacrifices in the Old Testament before anything is
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.160]   ritualized or concretized in law, it's almost as if
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:35.800]   Sacrifices hardwired into early humankind both in pagan circles and in believing circles
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:42.120]   So in chapter 4 verses 3 to 5 there are sacrifices being offered by
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.760]   Cain and Abel and
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:50.080]   Even Cain the prototypical evil doer according to 1st John 3
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.080]   11 and 12
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:05:00.040]   Is offering a sacrifice and you learn there that some sacrifices are acceptable and some are not Noah offers sacrifice following the flood in Genesis 8
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:06.600]   Abraham offers sacrifices on various altars mentioned in Genesis 12 Genesis 13
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:12.520]   and of course there is the great theme of the sacrifice of Isaac in Genesis 22 or the
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:17.240]   near sacrifice of Isaac when God himself in fact provides a
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:24.160]   Sacrificial lamb and the son is saved which becomes a paradigmatic of God's own sacrifice see Hebrews
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.160]   11 17 to 19 and once the law comes the law of Moses
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:34.640]   there are many sacrifices that are required a morning and evening sacrifice and
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.200]   sacrifices that are not always of animals, but but but
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.200]   sometimes of
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.960]   grain or vegetables
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.920]   But the two dominant sacrifices are Passover and Day of Atonement
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:56.160]   Passover is connected with Israel's very identity since the first Passover in Exodus 12
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.240]   takes place as
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:04.120]   The people of God are called out of slavery and on the way toward the promised land to constitute themselves
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.560]   under God as a nation and
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:14.400]   Eventually this this first Passover is tied in a symbol aden way to Jesus death see John
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:21.760]   1914 to 16 Paul goes so far as to say Christ our Passover has been sacrificed for us
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.960]   in first Corinthians 5 6 to 8 and
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:30.880]   So the Passover meal in which a lamb has been slaughtered and its blood
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:37.080]   sprinkled on the two doorposts and the lintel of the house and the whole animal is eaten in the house and
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:44.680]   reminds the people of the first Passover when they escaped slavery when God redeemed them from the land of of
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.880]   Slavery and
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:51.840]   because the blood was on the doorpost and the lintel
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:56.360]   Therefore the the angel of death passed over the house
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:02.720]   And hence the term Passover passed over the house and everyone in the house was spared including the firstborn son who was otherwise
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:10.200]   Killed so that became a way of looking for looking back to the past and that great act of redemption
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:14.520]   But because it was repeated year after year after year after year century after century
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:19.840]   Eventually thoughtful people would start asking. What does this point forward to it points back?
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:26.040]   But what does it point forward to and in the New Testament the answer to that is Christ's sacrifice the ultimate Passover
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:29.280]   In which his sacrifice his blood
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:36.960]   Spilt on our behalf means that death and destruction pass over his blood-bought people, too
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.960]   And then of course, there's the Day of Atonement
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:41.920]   Sacrifice was ritually
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:48.840]   instilled in Israel through a variety of feasts and so on but the great passage that deals with
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:52.600]   The Day of Atonement is Leviticus 16 here
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:08:00.720]   There is the blood of a bull and goat taken by the high priest to cover both his own sins and the sins of the people
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:10.160]   Taken behind the veil in the tabernacle later the temple only once a year on the prescribed date only by the high priest and
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.320]   sprinkled on top of the Ark of the Covenant and
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:16.980]   If anyone approached the presence of God in this way
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:22.200]   Without the blood or if it wasn't the high priest or on some other date
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.840]   Then that person was to be killed
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:30.640]   You just do not approach God except by the sacrifice and the stipulations that he himself
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:35.120]   carefully prescribes and so this becomes really
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:38.600]   Crucial in Israel
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:44.680]   Sadly on some occasions the ritual becomes more important than what it is pointing to
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:50.320]   there are careful precautions and preparations that are stipulated by the law and
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:54.160]   These preparations include not only
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.160]   elements of the sacrifice itself
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:00.800]   But of the priest and what he wears and his ablutions and and so on all designed to show
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:07.280]   That there is nothing more important for human beings than to have sins atoned for to have sins covered
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:11.240]   paid for so that men and women can be reconciled to the Living God and
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:17.760]   Everything is stipulated by God with sanctions if if people ignore what God stipulates
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.840]   Then there are great
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:28.640]   sacrificial passages to that point forward nothing more dramatic than Isaiah 52 13 to the end of 53
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:34.080]   where the ideal lamb is wounded for our transgressions and bruised for our iniquities and
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:38.560]   the beating that fell on him was for our peace and healing and
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:46.080]   he sees the the the agony of his own soul and and is is satisfied by
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:52.520]   By this sacrifice on our behalf, but it still has to be said that sacrifice is not
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:55.640]   automatically effective
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:10:03.440]   for for example that there is a vilification of Old Testament sacrifice by prophets when the sacrifice is offered as a
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:09.800]   Cover-up for heartless greed and selfishness when it's merely religious duty and the like
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.440]   See for example Isaiah 1
[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:17.120]   10 to 13 1st Samuel 15 22 and 23
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:21.480]   This does the Lord require sacrifice or does he require obedience or Micah 6?
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:26.440]   6 to 8 where sacrifice is being used as a an excuse for not
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:30.880]   pursuing righteousness and the like in which case all the sacrifice in the world is is
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:37.760]   Merely ritual. It's a stench in the Lord's nostrils. He cannot stand it because it's it reeks of hypocrisy
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.720]   So the Psalms for example
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.840]   hallow
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.840]   lawful and heartfelt sacrifice
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:49.400]   Psalm 4 5 Psalm 5 3 Psalm 50 verse 5
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:54.160]   but even at the same time they point to the reality behind the act and
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:11:00.480]   And insist on sincerity of heart. So that brings us to the New Testament and before we go any farther
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:07.240]   It's it's worth pausing for a moment to think carefully about some of the terms we use
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:15.240]   Atonement for example is God's work on sinners behalf to reconcile them to him
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.720]   It's a generic term that is very very broad
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:26.120]   There is a need for it because we're alienated from God and stand under God's righteous judgment
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:34.640]   The means for it are prescribed in the Old Testament and together these means point forward to the ultimate sacrifice
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:42.520]   Christ Jesus himself and that's where we need to stop and think about some theological terms like
[00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:45.880]   expiation and propitiation by expiation
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:52.120]   We mean that the sacrifice cancels the sin. So the object of expiation is the sin
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:54.920]   Christ's sacrifice
[00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:57.000]   cancels sin by
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.720]   taking the guilt and
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:04.280]   Absorbing it paying for it suffering taking it on himself
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:11.400]   But propitiation the object of the verb to propitiate is not sin, but wrath
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:19.560]   Propitiation is the sacrifice by which God is propitiated that is made propitious made favorable and it's
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:26.840]   Reasonable simply because God stands over against us both in love and in wrath
[00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:31.120]   he stands over against us in wrath because he's a holy God and
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:34.240]   must respond with perfect righteousness and
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:41.280]   Therefore judgment against our sin, but he stands over against us in love because he is that kind of God
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:46.760]   So some people have objected to the notion of propitiation because they say God
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:53.240]   So loves the world that he gives his son if he's already so favorably disposed to the world that he gives his son
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:55.920]   Then how can you speak of turning aside his wrath?
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:02.080]   But what that neglects is that God stands over against us both in love and in wrath
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:07.220]   He stands over against us in wrath as a function of his holiness. He stands over against us in love
[00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:10.840]   as a function is very of his very character and
[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:15.920]   Thus the sacrifice of Christ is presented in Scripture as simultaneously
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:23.360]   Canceling sin and turning aside the wrath of God. It's a mistake to pit propitiation and expiation
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:27.320]   Against each other. They're both taught in Scripture
[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:34.280]   And I suspect that both are hiding behind the words used in that great atonement passage of Romans chapter 3
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:36.560]   verses 21 to 26
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:44.480]   One has to remember that before reading those verses Romans 3 21 to 26 one is supposed to read Romans 1 18
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.080]   to
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.500]   320 that huge passage
[00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:52.000]   outlines all the human sin that
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:59.040]   Requires atonement if there's to be any cleansing and it begins the wrath of God is disclosed from heaven in other words
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:03.840]   The sacrifice that is presented deals with the wrath of God as a function of God's own holiness
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:11.480]   so Christ sheds his blood in the New Testament the blood of Christ and the cross of Christ and
[00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:15.480]   the atonement of Christ the death of Christ
[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:20.680]   Are all referring to the same thing that is Christ's sacrifice on our behalf
[00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:23.400]   some want the
[00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:31.000]   Shedding of blood and the sacrifice of Christ to be merely exemplary or merely celebratory. That is something that provides an example
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:37.120]   Or something that is celebrates the love of God, but don't want to call it substitutionary
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:40.080]   But Christ dies in our place
[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:47.480]   There are so many biblical texts that insist on that point. That's what cancels sin and turns aside the wrath of God
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:52.440]   So he took our sin in his own body on the tree
[00:14:52.440 --> 00:15:00.440]   And that's why Christians still insist on an expression such as penal substitution. Now, of course, there are different elements of
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:03.480]   Truth that are depicted in the cross
[00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:06.000]   Christ is our representative
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.640]   He becomes a human being and dies as one of us standing in for us
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:16.040]   But he is also our substitute. He demonstrates his love toward us on the cross
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:21.480]   But he does so precisely by bearing our punishment. That's why we speak of penal substitution
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:25.840]   And in my view penal substitution though
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:32.640]   It's not the only means of appropriate expression to depict the sacrifice of Christ. It is foundational and
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.080]   and
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:36.080]   not merely
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:37.160]   metaphorical
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:42.960]   And probably is the one that best grounds all the rest of the ways of talking about the cross of Christ
[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:49.040]   Perhaps perhaps it should also be said that Christ's sacrifice unlike the sacrifices of the Old Testament
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:56.840]   Are once for all Christ cries just before he dies it is finished. There is no more sacrifice for sin
[00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:59.400]   Hebrews insists
[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:05.480]   Hebrews 9 depicts Christ as the ultimate fulfillment of the great day of atonement passages and
[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:11.200]   And thus the New Testament insists that Christ brings all of these sacrificial themes
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:13.720]   together in himself and
[00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:20.880]   of course the the sacrifice of Christ is inevitably tied to the priesthood theme and to the temple theme and
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:23.160]   to the Jerusalem theme
[00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:24.520]   because
[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:28.800]   The sacrifices were offered in the temple in Jerusalem by the priests
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:36.600]   And and thus all of these themes come together in spectacular fulfillment in the vision of Revelation 21 and 22
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:40.400]   Where so many of these things come to a certain kind of climax?
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:43.440]   Two more details that I should mention
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:48.840]   during his earthly ministry the Lord Jesus performed healings and
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:54.520]   Raised the dead and cast out demons preached the gospel and so on the very interesting
[00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:58.120]   passage Matthew chapter 8 verses 14 to 17
[00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:01.080]   insists that when he was
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:04.120]   Healing the sick and casting out demons. He was actually fulfilling
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:12.400]   Isaiah 53 and so people have asked in the healing of people and this healing is paid for by the sacrifice
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.640]   depicted in Isaiah 53
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:21.360]   Does this mean there is healing in the atonement and if there is why does such healing take place?
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:23.360]   before the cross
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:26.640]   That is it takes place while Jesus is in his earthly ministry
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:32.000]   Heading toward the cross and to this two things must be said first of course
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:40.120]   There's healing in the atonement all the blessings that come to us from God are secured ultimately through the atonement
[00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:47.160]   Including resurrection bodies the fact that God is patient with us and forbearing and doesn't just wipe us out is
[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:51.840]   A function of the fact that his dear son has now paid for our sins
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:56.080]   So of course this healing in the atonement the question is not whether this healing in the atonement
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:18:02.160]   The question is when do we receive all the benefits of the atonement some of these benefits we receive right away
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:08.720]   But physical healing in its most ultimate sense takes place at the consummation when we gain resurrection
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.560]   Bodies all secured at the end of the day by the cross of Christ
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.600]   So of course there's healing in the atonement
[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:21.640]   But it doesn't follow that we always get the healing right now that we want which is why for example the Apostle Paul has to leave
[00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:25.160]   Trophimus behind because he's sick
[00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:31.440]   It's not that Paul forgot to pray for him or that that his prayers weren't particularly effective that day some some sicknesses are not going
[00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:33.440]   to get healed now until the end and
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:35.440]   Yet there are
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:37.440]   instances where God's
[00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:43.360]   Miraculous healing that does a point to the ultimate healing that takes place at the end and in both cases
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:45.360]   They're secured by the cross of Christ
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:50.360]   But the fact remains that the healings that Jesus performs are
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:58.760]   Themselves a function of Christ's cross work which when Jesus performs the healing has not yet taken place in other words the effect of
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:03.640]   Christ's cross work runs backward in time as well as forward in time
[00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:07.760]   And that's merely a function of the fact that God knows Christ knows
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:11.880]   What Christ has come to do there is a sense as?
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:17.800]   Revelation puts it in chapters 13 and 17 that Christ is the lamb who was slain before the foundation of the world
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:25.600]   Not literally, but in God's mind. It's it's already a done deal and thus there is a sense in which Jesus healings done before the cross
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:32.880]   Find their effective payment in the cross which is still around the corner and thus point forward to the cross
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:38.400]   Just as any healing in the book of Acts for example points back to the cross and the resurrection
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:46.240]   What have already taken place as the crucial step in bringing about the ultimate healing that arrives with the consummation of the return of Christ?
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:51.400]   And the last thing to be said although it is true that
[00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:58.320]   Christ's sacrifice is once for all and it pays for our sins and it grounds our
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:01.480]   Forgiveness it grounds our assurance before God
[00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:05.560]   We don't have to earn our way to the presence of God all of these things
[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:10.000]   Flow from the cross they flow from the sacrifice of Christ they flow from a shed blood
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.960]   Yet at the same time when for example in Matthew
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:18.360]   16 or mark 10
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:25.360]   Jesus announces clearly that the Messiah must be crucified and rise again the third day the apostles aren't ready to accept it
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:32.280]   Jesus insists that it's the case and then also says that his disciples are to take up their cross and follow him and
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:35.600]   In that sense Christians are called to sacrifice, too
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:42.840]   So in first Peter 2 where this is very strong the uniqueness of Christ's sacrifice is greatly stressed
[00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:46.680]   He bore our sin in his own body on the tree
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:50.520]   That's unique, but at the same time Peter can say
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:55.520]   That Jesus went to the cross leaving us an example that we should follow in his steps
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:58.120]   So there is an exemplary
[00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:00.280]   component to the cross of Christ
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:06.640]   That's why the Apostle Paul can pray. Oh that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his suffering
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:11.160]   He wants to be conformed to Christ and it's why elsewhere
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:18.520]   Paul can write to the Philippians and say it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe on his name
[00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:23.880]   But also to suffer for his sake so there is a sense in which we are to take up our cross
[00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:31.800]   Gladly and follow Christ on the way to the cross not because any suffering that we endure
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:34.280]   atones for the sins of others
[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:36.880]   But because it does identify us with Christ
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:44.800]   We want to go where Jesus went Paul can go so far as to say that he'd like to fill up the afflictions
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:45.920]   of Christ
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:47.920]   that is to say
[00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:55.320]   Christ through his body the church still suffers Jesus identifies with his body the church it still suffers
[00:21:55.320 --> 00:22:00.800]   it's almost as if there's a quota a top amount of suffering that the church must endure and
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:05.000]   Paul is prepared to take more than his share as it were precisely
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.680]   by filling up the
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.680]   afflictions of Christ in this way to
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:12.600]   Enable some fellow Christians to suffer a little less
[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:17.720]   So in our day and generation when dark clouds are looming
[00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:20.720]   Far from complaining that it's not fair
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:26.800]   We need ourselves to take up the example of the early apostles who rejoiced when they were beaten up
[00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:32.640]   Because they were found worthy to suffer for the name so in that sense Christ's sacrifice is
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:34.560]   Perpetual
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:38.040]   Perpetually effective rather it's unique it does not recur
[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:41.480]   It cannot be copied or imitated
[00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:49.520]   But the Lord's table points back to it and our own sufferings are to be aligned with it that we in turn ourselves
[00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:52.440]   May commend the cross of Christ to others today
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:58.400]   Amen that is a helpful and valuable overview from his home office that was dr.
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:01.240]   Don Carson the co-founder and president of the gospel coalition
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:08.840]   Well, it's time for us to celebrate Christmas this weekend and for John Piper and on behalf of the entire team at desiring
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:13.800]   God org we would like to extend to you all a very Merry Christmas
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:20.200]   And we pray that it would be a season to draw you near to Christ to see the magnificent glory of
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:25.840]   His sacrifice a sacrifice which begins in the little town of Bethlehem
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:28.960]   I'm your host Tony Reinke. We'll see you on Monday
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:30.960]   You
