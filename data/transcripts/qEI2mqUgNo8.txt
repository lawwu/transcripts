[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880]   I should like to call your attention this morning to the words which are to be found
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:13.120]   in Paul's epistle to the Ephesians in the fourth chapter, verses 4, 5, and 6.
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:21.320]   Verses 4, 5, and 6 in the fourth chapter of Paul's epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:29.520]   There is one body and one spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling,
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:38.160]   one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is above all and through
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.600]   all and in you all.
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:50.800]   I am calling attention once more to this statement contained in these three verses, in which
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:58.520]   the great apostle gives particular reasons to the members of this church at Ephesus and
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:07.880]   through them to us and to all Christians everywhere and at all times for being diligent always
[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:14.280]   to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.960]   That is his first practical application of the great doctrine which he has been laying
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.960]   down, you remember, in the first three chapters of this epistle.
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.240]   And having laid down his doctrine, he now comes and says, "I therefore, the prisoner
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:34.000]   of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called."
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.040]   And then comes the appeal, "That with all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.840]   for bearing one another in love, endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.840]   of peace."
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.200]   And he says, "Now there are very good reasons why you should do this.
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.760]   The unity is there already."
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:00.820]   And in these three verses he describes the character, the nature of this essential unity
[00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.020]   that is in the church.
[00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.960]   This is not something men create, it is already there.
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:17.560]   One body, one Spirit, one hope of your calling, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.040]   and Father of all, who is above all and through all and in you all.
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.960]   Well now, we saw last Sunday morning that the apostle therefore puts his doctrine of
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:34.760]   the unity of the church essentially in terms of the doctrine of the blessed Holy Trinity.
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:41.320]   You notice the first three items, grouped together in verse 4, are around the person
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.040]   of the Holy Spirit.
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.520]   The second three in verse 5 are around the person of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:56.440]   And then in the sixth verse, the last is God himself, the Eternal Father.
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:02.320]   So that we must be clear in our minds always when we are thinking of unity in connection
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.720]   with the church.
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.920]   We must be clear that it must be thought of always in terms which correspond to this.
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:16.560]   We must never think of it in any terms lower than this whole conception of the triunity
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.440]   of the Godhead, the three in one and the one in three.
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.720]   Now we are considering at the moment in particular the first group, the group found in verse
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.960]   4, the group around the person and the work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:38.920]   And last Sunday morning we looked at that first statement, one body.
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.400]   And we saw that the church is not a loose collection of people.
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.960]   The church is unlike any human society.
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:52.240]   There is an organic unity about the life of the church which can be thought of very conveniently
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:58.880]   in terms of the essential, vital, organic unity that is, of course, the characteristic
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.560]   of our human frames.
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.200]   Our bodies are not collections of parts.
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.520]   There is a wholeness.
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.960]   These parts are parts of the body and the whole is greater than the summation of the
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.360]   parts.
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.240]   And that is a principle that we must never lose sight of.
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:22.680]   The church is not just an odd gathering or a loose gathering or a collection of people.
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:31.240]   There is about her this internal, essential unity that we can see depicted and illustrated
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:37.520]   there in this very illustration of which the apostle is so fond.
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:44.960]   But now having looked at that, we pass on, by a kind of logical necessity, by a kind
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:53.480]   of inevitability, to the second item, the second term that he uses.
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:59.440]   Because at once we all must feel a number of questions arising within us, and here is
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.340]   obviously the first question.
[00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:06.200]   If the church is the body of Christ, and if the church is like a body, well, the question
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.320]   is where does it come from?
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.560]   How has the body been formed?
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.360]   How has it ever come into being?
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.160]   What constitutes the life of the body?
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.800]   What is it that enables the body to function?
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.080]   What is it that makes the body a living, vital organism?
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.000]   It is quite an inevitable question, isn't it?
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.400]   And the apostle obviously had the same question in his mind, because he answers it at once.
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.080]   And his answer is the Holy Spirit.
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:50.320]   One body and one Spirit, with a capital S. Not a kind of spirit of friendship or of camaraderie
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.920]   or of brotherliness and what we call fellowship and kindness.
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:55.920]   No, no.
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:00.100]   It is the Holy Spirit himself, one Spirit.
[00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:07.360]   In other words, the church is the result of the activity of the Holy Spirit himself.
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.660]   It is he who operates in the church, in the production of the church, in the maintenance
[00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.000]   and the well-being of the life of the church.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:22.920]   And again, therefore, the apostle is anxious to show how inevitable is this doctrine of
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:31.200]   the unity of the church because of the fact that the Holy Spirit is here in the very centre
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.920]   of the body and is the life and being of the organism.
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:36.920]   Very well.
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:40.280]   Let us observe what he has to say.
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.320]   He says one Spirit.
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:48.480]   Now this is an important bit of doctrine again.
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:58.160]   There is only one Holy Spirit and he is indivisible.
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:04.640]   Now that is really the whole basis of everything the apostle has got to say here.
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:14.160]   I wonder whether we realise this as we ought, that there is only one Holy Spirit who is
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:20.280]   a person and therefore indivisible.
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:25.520]   Now there are many evil spirits.
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.540]   Had you noticed that?
[00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:32.960]   In the sixth chapter of this epistle, in the tenth verse and so on, the apostle will be
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:37.640]   saying to us that we wrestle not against flesh and blood, well, against what?
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:45.120]   Against principalities and powers and the rulers, all in the plural, you notice, of
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:50.320]   the darkness of this world, spiritual wickedness in high places.
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:54.080]   There is a plurality of evil spirits.
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:08:06.520]   There are thousands, perhaps millions, of evil spirits, but there is only one Holy Spirit.
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:12.200]   There is not a multiplicity of holy spirits corresponding to the multiplicity of evil
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.200]   spirits.
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:17.320]   Oh no, only one, this blessed person.
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:22.560]   Now this, it seems to me, is something that we tend to forget.
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:28.320]   And that is why, of course, he is called the Holy Spirit, to differentiate him once and
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:32.800]   forever from all these other spirits.
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:35.160]   You get the same thing, of course, coming out in the Gospels.
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:41.240]   Do you remember the case of the poor men of Gadara whom our Lord healed?
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.440]   And do you remember the statement that the devils made to him?
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:47.480]   They said, "We are legion."
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.520]   It was not merely one evil spirit in that poor man.
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:55.800]   There was in that man a legion of evil spirits.
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:09:01.600]   And do you remember that illustration our Lord uses, that if you cast out the evil spirit
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:06.640]   by some merely human power, well, then he will come back and bring seven more with him,
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:07.960]   even worse than himself.
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.720]   There are many such evil spirits.
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:18.560]   The biblical teaching is that there is a great kingdom of evil headed up by the devil, Satan,
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:21.800]   the prince of the power of the air.
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:31.160]   But he has his emissaries, he has his officials, he has his underlings, he has all sorts of
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:39.120]   persons and of characters and of natures that he implies, principalities, powers, rulers
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:43.480]   of the darkness of this world, spiritual wickedness in the high places.
[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:51.640]   There is a great mass of them, a host of them, a legion of them.
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:59.000]   But there is only one Holy Spirit, not a multiplicity here.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:08.040]   There is one blessed person, the third person, in the blessed Holy Trinity.
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:14.480]   And it is he who is responsible for the Church and creates the unity of the Church.
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:22.040]   And therefore this unity is indivisible because the person of the Spirit is obviously something
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:25.160]   that you cannot divide.
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:32.400]   Very well then, it behoves us to go on from that, to consider it more in detail.
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:43.200]   But let us always bear this in mind, that the Spirit in the Church is not an influence.
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:49.080]   We must never speak of him as "it," as we often tend to do.
[00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.520]   The Holy Spirit is a person.
[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:55.600]   He is as much a person as the Father, he is as much a person as the Son.
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:00.960]   When he shall come, says our Lord, he will do this and that.
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:09.920]   Not an influence, not some kind of commodity, not a force, not a mere power, but the person
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.600]   himself.
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:16.560]   And for that reason I say, indivisible.
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:21.760]   And then of course we can deduce certain other truths from this, which again all help to
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:28.200]   bring out and to emphasize the indivisibility and therefore the unity.
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:36.540]   Because it is the Holy Spirit and because the work is his work, we are entitled to say
[00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:42.060]   that he always does the same work.
[00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:47.040]   And it is because he does the same work in us all that there is this essential unity
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.040]   in the Church.
[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:53.800]   Now, I must not be misunderstood at this point.
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:12:01.000]   There are, of course, superficial variations in the work that he does.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:09.280]   There are minor and superficial manifestations and differences in the manifestations of the
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:10.280]   work.
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:13.080]   But it is all essentially one.
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:19.280]   It has often been pointed out that there are no two flowers that are absolutely identical.
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:23.580]   They belong to the same family, to the same group, same species, whatever you call it.
[00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:25.580]   But there are no two of them that are identical.
[00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:28.920]   You have never seen two buttercups that are absolutely identical.
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:35.000]   They are both buttercups, but there is just some little difference, as in the members
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   of a family.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.600]   They have got the same blood, they are the same family, but no two are identical.
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.160]   They may almost appear to be, so that you cannot differentiate.
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.680]   And yet there is always some difference.
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:47.120]   Well, now, that, I say, applies in the Christian life.
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:50.160]   It is the work of the Holy Spirit, and it is always the same work.
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.520]   Yes, but Christian people are not like peas in a pub.
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:55.200]   They are not like postage stamps.
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:13:01.560]   And it is important to remember this, because that is one of the best ways of differentiating
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:04.960]   between the work of the Holy Spirit and the work of men.
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:08.800]   Men in his mass production tend to repeat things almost identically.
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:12.760]   There is that exact sameness.
[00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:15.120]   Psychology does the same thing.
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:22.960]   It produces the same sort of person in every respect, even in these details that are immaterial.
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:28.560]   And it is one of the ways in which the spurious and the false and the counterfeit always tend
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:31.120]   to give themselves away.
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:37.600]   The Holy Spirit does the work, and it is always essentially the same work.
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.400]   What I mean is this.
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:44.920]   Take for instance the work of preparation.
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:51.040]   Now when we were dealing with the second chapter, and looking at the teaching towards the end
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:56.480]   of that second chapter about a year ago, you remember we had to deal with this very point
[00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:02.800]   in which all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord.
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:09.160]   And we saw that all the stones in this temple, this building, the church, all have to be
[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:13.800]   prepared, and they are prepared before they are brought to be put into the building.
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:18.400]   The work is done far away in the quarry, as it were, so that there should be no noise
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:21.600]   as the actual building is being built up.
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.760]   But there is a work of preparation.
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:27.760]   The stones as they are in the quarry are not all right.
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:33.520]   They have to be trimmed and shaped and so on in order that they may take their appropriate
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:37.000]   positions and thus together build up the wall.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:45.680]   Well now, it is in that way exactly that this work of preparation is absolutely essential
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:46.680]   in us.
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:53.940]   A great deal has to be done to the natural man before he can become a member of the body
[00:14:53.940 --> 00:15:01.280]   of Christ, or a stone or a brick in this glorious edifice which is the temple of God.
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:06.680]   Now don't you see at once that it is failure to remember that and to realize that, that
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:13.600]   accounts for most of the problems in the life of the Christian church today as it has always
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:18.840]   accounted for them throughout the centuries.
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:19.840]   What do I mean?
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:27.240]   I mean this, that the visible church, alas, is composed of many who have never undergone
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:31.660]   this work of preparation.
[00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:35.260]   But you see, while they may belong to the visible church, they do not belong to the
[00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.360]   invisible church.
[00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:42.240]   There are all sorts of ways and means whereby we become members of the visible church.
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:44.080]   We are familiar with them, are we not?
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:48.080]   It is sometimes a pure accident of nationality.
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:52.120]   If you are born in a country like this, at least if you were until comparatively recently,
[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:55.960]   the probability was that you would be brought up in a religious atmosphere.
[00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:59.520]   There are other countries in the world called pagan in which that is not true.
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:04.040]   So it may be entirely decided by the fact whether you are brought up in Great Britain
[00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:08.800]   or say in Japan or China or one of the countries of South America.
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:16.040]   And then it is often a pure accident of family and of a particular blood or tradition.
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:19.600]   All these are the factors.
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:24.680]   I am sure that there are many in this chapel at this moment who know exactly what I am
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:26.720]   saying.
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:32.280]   You found yourself a member of the church not because the Holy Spirit had done anything
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:38.240]   in you or to you, but simply because of one of these accidents to which I am referring.
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:40.800]   I am giving you my own experience.
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:42.960]   Let me give it to you even in detail.
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:47.640]   When I was received as a full member of the Christian church, I was asked one question
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:49.800]   only.
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:51.480]   And you know what that question was.
[00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:53.240]   It was this.
[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:58.600]   What was the name of the brook, the little river, which our Lord and the disciples had
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:05.000]   to cross in going from the utter room to the place of trial?
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   That was the only question I was asked.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.680]   I did not remember the answer to that question, but I was received into the full membership
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:18.560]   of the Christian church.
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:20.200]   Now I am not romancing.
[00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:25.560]   I am stating to you something that literally has happened to me myself, and it has happened
[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:28.120]   to many of you.
[00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:34.080]   At a given age, the minister or the clergyman had a conversation with your parents.
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:39.360]   Isn't it about time he said or they said, it doesn't matter which, that he or she
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:44.320]   now became a full member of the church?
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:50.720]   And then perhaps you were given a little instruction, and in due time you were received into the
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:55.320]   membership of the church.
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:58.020]   You had no living experience.
[00:17:58.020 --> 00:17:59.920]   You really did not know what it was about fundamentally.
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:02.920]   It was the thing to do.
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:06.520]   You see, that is what happens in the visible church, but that is not what happens in the
[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.680]   invisible church.
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:12.080]   You can become a member of the visible church in that way, but you will never become a member
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:17.760]   of the body of Christ in that way.
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:23.960]   Before we become members of the body of Christ, the Holy Spirit does this work of inevitable
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:24.960]   preparation.
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:31.400]   You cannot be joined to him in all his glory and his purity as you are by nature, a child
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:35.760]   of wrath, even as others, dead in trespasses and sins.
[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:37.900]   It is impossible.
[00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:41.600]   But it does not happen.
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:48.440]   The apostle Paul himself makes this terribly plain and clear in his first epistle to the
[00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:49.720]   Corinthians.
[00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:51.600]   Let me read these words to you.
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:58.040]   "Know ye not," he says in chapter 6, verse 9, "know ye not that the unrighteous shall
[00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:02.240]   not inherit the kingdom of God?
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:09.540]   Be ye not deceived, neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate,
[00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:15.340]   nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor
[00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:20.620]   revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God, and such were some of
[00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:21.620]   you.
[00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:24.180]   But they are now in the kingdom.
[00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:25.180]   How has it happened?
[00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:26.180]   Here is the answer.
[00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:34.180]   "But ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord
[00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:38.980]   Jesus and by the Spirit of our God."
[00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:42.980]   That is how it has happened.
[00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:49.260]   Without this work of the Holy Spirit upon us, we are not and cannot be members of the
[00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:53.020]   body of Christ, and therefore, of course, there is no unity.
[00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:58.660]   That is why churches, individual churches, are divided often, and groups and collections
[00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:00.380]   of churches are divided.
[00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:05.380]   You see, the other elements are more important, the national element, national church, and
[00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:06.380]   so on.
[00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:07.380]   All that divides.
[00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:13.080]   Church of this country, church of another country, it is all so unscriptural and unspiritual.
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:18.220]   But these are the things that matter, and all the other man-made traditions.
[00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:24.180]   Hence, you see, all your divisions, because people have not realized that apart from the
[00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:27.540]   work of the Holy Spirit, you have not got a true church.
[00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:32.020]   You have not got the body of Christ, whatever you may have externally and in appearance.
[00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:34.340]   Very well, then, what is this work that he does?
[00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:42.800]   Well, let me remind you of these things, that we all may examine ourselves this morning.
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:47.660]   What is this preliminary work that the Holy Spirit must of necessity do before anybody
[00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:50.860]   can be a member of the body of Christ?
[00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:54.940]   First, conviction of sin.
[00:20:54.940 --> 00:21:05.340]   It is always the first thing he does, conviction of sin.
[00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:10.980]   There we were, satisfied with ourselves, content to go on, imagining all was well, that perhaps
[00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:15.840]   we were very good people, or perhaps knowing that we were bad people, but still no conviction
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:19.140]   of sin.
[00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:26.660]   But when the Holy Spirit begins to work, he convicts us of sin.
[00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:33.820]   When he shall come, he shall convict the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment
[00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:34.820]   to come.
[00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:41.660]   And he does, invariably, conviction of sin, and with it, of course, the two go together,
[00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:46.620]   the holiness of God.
[00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:49.700]   He makes us aware of God.
[00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:55.580]   We may have talked about God for years, we may have said our prayers to him, but we have
[00:21:55.580 --> 00:22:00.180]   never thought about him and we know nothing about him until the Holy Spirit begins to
[00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:01.660]   deal with us.
[00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:03.260]   And these two things happen together.
[00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:06.340]   I am made to see myself.
[00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:11.000]   I begin to understand that the trouble with me is not so much that I do things that I
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.300]   shouldn't do, but that I ever want to do them.
[00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:20.580]   And I am aware that there is something within me that is vile and rotten and wrong, a perverted
[00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:22.940]   and twisted nature.
[00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:25.820]   And I don't know God and I am an enemy against God.
[00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:28.340]   And there is a hatred of God in the depths of my heart.
[00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:32.060]   Oh, God is all right as long as he keeps his place, as it were, and doesn't interfere
[00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:33.100]   with me.
[00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:36.260]   And I can turn to him when I am in need and pray and so on.
[00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:40.380]   But I don't want God to dominate my life and I don't want to be guided by God.
[00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:41.380]   Isn't that it?
[00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:52.060]   The Holy Spirit awakens us to all this, conviction of sin, conviction of our lost condition,
[00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:55.620]   conviction of our emptiness and of our woe.
[00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:58.340]   Oh, I don't keep you with this.
[00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:06.300]   All I am concerned to show you is this, that when that happens, you see, there is one inevitable
[00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:10.300]   result and that is that we are humbled.
[00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:12.180]   We are brought down.
[00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:16.060]   We are made to see ourselves as we really are.
[00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:19.060]   Our pride goes.
[00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:28.340]   Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast save in the death of Christ my God.
[00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:36.460]   All the vain things that charm me most, I sacrifice them to thy blood.
[00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:38.340]   It brings us down.
[00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:41.780]   It destroys all pride.
[00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:46.100]   We have left in us to make us boast or to make us think we are better than anybody else
[00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:50.460]   because we see how thoroughly violent and rotten we are ourselves and we know that the
[00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:52.020]   same is true about them.
[00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:55.820]   There is no self any longer that is worth defending.
[00:23:55.820 --> 00:24:02.380]   There is nothing in us that is worth holding on to or anything to assert.
[00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:09.900]   Ah, the Apostle Paul, while he was Saul of Tarsus and before the Holy Spirit did this
[00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:17.140]   work in him, was a man who was a great boaster.
[00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:24.700]   Hebrew of the Hebrews, tribe of Benjamin, circumcised the eighth day, feet of Gamaliel,
[00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:30.980]   best scholar, marvellous, wonderful, exceeding all others in zeal and energy and in serving
[00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:35.500]   God, ah, yes.
[00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:38.940]   But what things were gained for me, them I counted but loss.
[00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:43.060]   It all became dung and refuse.
[00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:48.540]   And later on in writing to Timothy he says, "It is a faithful saying and worthy of all
[00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:56.820]   acceptation that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners of whom I am the chief."
[00:24:56.820 --> 00:25:02.780]   He is down in the dust.
[00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:06.180]   He has lost his pride, his boasting is everything.
[00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:07.180]   He is nothing.
[00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:13.180]   There is no greater sinner, he says, in the universe than I myself.
[00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:21.580]   Or if you prefer it in the words of Charles Wesley, "Just and holy is thy name.
[00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:31.380]   I am all unrighteousness, vile and full of sin I am."
[00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:33.620]   That is the work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:36.940]   And you know, if every member of the visible church felt like that, there would be no trouble
[00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:40.300]   at all, would there?
[00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:43.980]   You see, the work of the Holy Spirit guarantees unity.
[00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:50.300]   If we were all just down there in dust and ashes and shame and sorrow and seeing the
[00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:55.460]   vileness in ourselves, there of necessity would be unity.
[00:25:55.460 --> 00:26:02.340]   It is a unity in failure, a unity in sin, a unity in shame, a unity in utter helplessness
[00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:04.980]   and hopelessness.
[00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:13.900]   It is because the church is not convicted of sin that she is not one.
[00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:17.860]   You see, people are still holding on to things they can boast of, things they can glory in,
[00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:19.420]   and they are none of these things at all.
[00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:23.180]   They have not been brought down, they have not been humbled and humiliated, they have
[00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:28.460]   not seen their nothingness conviction of sin.
[00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:29.460]   But let me go on.
[00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:32.340]   The next thing then is, of course, quickening and regeneration.
[00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:36.740]   There is not an absolute order about these, but we have got to put them in some sort of
[00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:37.740]   order.
[00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:43.140]   These things seem to happen very much at the same time, but there is this quickening, regeneration,
[00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:47.180]   the giving of a new life.
[00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:50.940]   You cannot be a Christian without being born again.
[00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:55.820]   You remember how our Lord fixed that once and forever with Nicodemus.
[00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:59.740]   You cannot be a member of the body of Christ unless you have got something of his life
[00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:00.740]   in you.
[00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:01.740]   The thing is a sheer impossibility.
[00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:04.340]   There is no need to argue about it.
[00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:06.260]   You can join the church, be a member of a society.
[00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:10.020]   You cannot belong to Christ unless his life is in you.
[00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:16.900]   Regeneration, new birth, new creation, born again, it does not matter which term you use.
[00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:22.460]   You see, when we are made Christians, what the Holy Spirit does to us is not to improve
[00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:23.460]   us a little bit.
[00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:28.780]   He does not just get rid of a few spots and stains here and there and trim us up a bit
[00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:31.660]   and put on a new coat of paint and a little varnish on that.
[00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:35.380]   No, no, we have got to be remade from the very foundation.
[00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:39.140]   You have to quicken.
[00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:42.660]   New life, new nature.
[00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:47.300]   The Christian is a partaker of the divine nature.
[00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:54.740]   He is a member of the household of God, of the family of God.
[00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:58.300]   Now I remind you again that that does not mean, of course, that we are identical in
[00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:03.740]   every single detail, but it means we have all got this new life.
[00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:09.780]   And you see, this is the point, it is the same life in every one of us.
[00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:12.420]   How different we were before in every respect.
[00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:18.420]   Now we are all partakers together of the divine nature, this same essential life.
[00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:20.300]   We belong to the same family.
[00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:21.700]   We are related to one another.
[00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:25.540]   The same blood, as it were, is coursing through our arteries and veins.
[00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:31.820]   Here it is, all one and always the same, and the same in every one.
[00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:37.260]   There is not much real difficulty about unity in a church where all the members are born
[00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:39.020]   again.
[00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:46.100]   It is when we are not, you see, that the divisions inevitably arise.
[00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:50.940]   And that brings me on to the next thing he does where he enables us to exercise faith
[00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:54.620]   and gives us understanding.
[00:28:54.620 --> 00:29:00.380]   By grace are ye saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God.
[00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:03.340]   Faith and understanding.
[00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:07.940]   I am not staying with this this morning because I shall have to deal with it in verse 5, but
[00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:12.500]   the point is, you see, it is exactly the same faith once more.
[00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:13.500]   Who are we?
[00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:18.340]   Well, we are sharers, according to the epistle of Jude, in the common salvation.
[00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:25.420]   There is only one Saviour, one Lord, one faith, one baptism.
[00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:27.620]   There is only one work.
[00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:33.140]   There is only one blood that can cover me and my sins and put me right with God.
[00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:34.260]   Only one.
[00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:41.660]   There is none other name under heaven given amongst men whereby we must be saved.
[00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:46.820]   And the work of the Holy Spirit is to glorify him.
[00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:49.740]   So here we are, you see, we have all been licking the dust together.
[00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:53.540]   Then we have all been given this new life and we are now all looking together into the
[00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:56.140]   eyes of the same blessed person.
[00:29:56.140 --> 00:30:00.420]   And we have got no time to look at one another and to compare and contrast ourselves with
[00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:01.420]   one another.
[00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:06.020]   We are all looking at him and glorying in him and we are united in him.
[00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:13.980]   And there is no room, there is no time for division.
[00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:18.780]   And we have all got the same desires.
[00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:25.340]   Blessed are they that who hunger and thirst after righteousness.
[00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:29.900]   We are no longer seeking little offices or places of importance.
[00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:33.020]   We are hungering and thirsting after righteousness.
[00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:39.460]   Oh, isn't the tragedy of the Church that she has forgotten this doctrine?
[00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:45.020]   The body, one body, one spirit, the work of the Spirit is forgotten.
[00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:49.780]   And all these other ugly things raise up their heads and they cause schism and division and
[00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:51.220]   trouble.
[00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:52.220]   But we must face none.
[00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:53.900]   The next thing that he does is this.
[00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:58.620]   There is his work of preparation.
[00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:03.500]   The next work he does, of course, is the work of incorporation into the body.
[00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:08.020]   We have now been prepared and now he is going to incorporate us.
[00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:09.020]   And what does he do?
[00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:12.380]   Well, he unites us to the Lord Jesus Christ himself.
[00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:17.700]   And in doing so, he puts us into his body and we all, therefore, are united to one another.
[00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:23.300]   Listen to Paul saying it in that great statement in 1 Corinthians 12, verse 13.
[00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:31.220]   "For by one Spirit have we all been baptized into one body."
[00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:35.860]   You see, there it is once and forever.
[00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:42.780]   Whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free, we have all been made to
[00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:47.340]   drink into one Spirit.
[00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:53.340]   It is the Spirit that baptizes us into the body of Christ.
[00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:54.340]   It is his work.
[00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:55.340]   We are not aware of it.
[00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:58.500]   It is an unconscious work as far as we are concerned.
[00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:03.660]   But thus he has called us and he has quickened us and he has prepared us and he baptizes
[00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:05.140]   us into the body.
[00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:10.740]   And we are members of the body of Christ and share us in this great unity and therefore
[00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:13.340]   join to one another.
[00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:19.700]   I really could keep you at great length on every one of these headings that I am giving
[00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:20.700]   you.
[00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:24.460]   Work them out, my friends, for yourselves at leisure.
[00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:34.140]   The next point I make is this, that he then animates the life of the whole body himself.
[00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:36.100]   It is he who does that, you remember.
[00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:41.740]   Did you notice it in the reading at the beginning out of that first epistle to the Corinthians?
[00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:48.940]   In that third chapter, "Know ye not that ye are the temple of God and that the Spirit
[00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:52.300]   of God dwelleth in you?
[00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:57.700]   If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy.
[00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:01.460]   For the temple of God is holy, which temple you are."
[00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:03.580]   Now there he is talking about the church.
[00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:07.020]   When he says, "Know ye not that ye are the temple of God," he is speaking to the
[00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:08.860]   church collectively.
[00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:12.860]   In chapter 6 he is going to speak about the individual, and he says, "Know ye not that
[00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:16.260]   your bodies are the temples of the Holy Ghost?"
[00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:21.460]   But here it is the church.
[00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:28.480]   The Holy Spirit himself is the medium through which and by means of which the organic unity
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:31.540]   of the body is preserved.
[00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:39.020]   He is like the life of our physical bodies, or indeed, if you like, like the blood in
[00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:40.820]   our physical bodies.
[00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:47.220]   There is this unifying Spirit connecting them all together and making them one, as we saw
[00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:48.380]   last Sunday morning.
[00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:56.380]   The Holy Spirit is the life of the body, and when he is not there, the body is dead.
[00:33:56.380 --> 00:34:00.980]   That is why you can have a dead church.
[00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:05.460]   But this is not the invisible church that is never dead.
[00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:12.140]   That is always alive because he is always the life, and the animating and the unifying
[00:34:12.140 --> 00:34:21.780]   principle in the body makes it one and thus establishes the organic unity.
[00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:25.900]   And indeed, we can go on and add this.
[00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:34.380]   While he animates the whole body, he at the same time animates each separate part also.
[00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:41.140]   It is there, I say, in the contrast between 1 Corinthians 3, 16 and 17, and 1 Corinthians
[00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:44.260]   6, 19 and 20.
[00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:47.940]   Now this is a marvelous thing.
[00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:52.100]   It is a great mystery, but it is a fact.
[00:34:52.100 --> 00:35:02.700]   The Holy Spirit does exactly the same work of sanctification in every single one of us.
[00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:07.260]   Sanctification means being like the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:11.260]   And therefore all who are being sanctified must be similar because they are all becoming
[00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:13.900]   more and more like him.
[00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:16.780]   John says, "When we see him, we shall be like him."
[00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:20.620]   We will all be like him, perfectly sanctified.
[00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:27.460]   The spots and the wrinkles will all have gone and we will all be like him and all like one
[00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:30.580]   another.
[00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:36.140]   His work of sanctification in each is identical, but then you see he goes on and produces exactly
[00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:39.500]   the same fruit in all of us.
[00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:44.220]   And as you think of the unity of the church, think of this.
[00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:49.180]   When the Holy Spirit is in us and dwelling in us and controlling us as he should, he
[00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:51.940]   produces his own fruitiness.
[00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:53.940]   And his fruit is always the same.
[00:35:53.940 --> 00:36:00.060]   The fruit of the Spirit is always love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness,
[00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:03.140]   faith, meekness, temperance.
[00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:04.140]   Always the same.
[00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:08.740]   It does not matter whether you are looking at a Christian in England or in China or Japan
[00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:10.300]   or in Venezuela.
[00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:14.220]   The fruit of the Spirit is always the same.
[00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:21.060]   These blessed graces of the Spirit.
[00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:26.260]   And you see when they are present, there is of necessity unity.
[00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:29.980]   It is not something to appeal to people to produce.
[00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:32.260]   It is he alone who can produce it.
[00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:35.780]   It is always the result of his work and his activity.
[00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:40.060]   Or if you prefer it, look at it as you get it in 1 Corinthians 13, the great hymn of
[00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:41.060]   love.
[00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:44.420]   If only we were all like that, there would never be any more division.
[00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:50.900]   None of us would be puffed up.
[00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:54.540]   We would all be hoping all things, believing all things.
[00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:57.740]   We would have that love that never fails.
[00:36:57.740 --> 00:37:08.140]   Oh, you see, it is as the Spirit does his work that this unity comes into being.
[00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:09.660]   You know the thing that divides us?
[00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:13.020]   Well, let me tell you.
[00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:19.620]   What divides is the natural personality.
[00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:27.620]   Our natural personalities are sinful and they divide, don't they?
[00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:32.740]   They assert themselves and there is always the element of selfishness and of self.
[00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:37.540]   And there is a clash inevitably of personalities.
[00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:42.100]   When you become a Christian, you don't lose your personality in a fundamental sense, but
[00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:44.820]   you are no longer governed by your personality.
[00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:47.700]   Your personality is governed by the Holy Spirit.
[00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:56.220]   And through your personality, the graces, the fruit of the Spirit, begins to show itself.
[00:37:56.220 --> 00:38:01.540]   And that is what happens, you see, when the Holy Spirit is resident and is producing his
[00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:05.500]   blessed and his glorious fruit.
[00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:10.540]   We all recognize it when we see it and we love it in one another.
[00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:16.060]   And these awkward, angular personalities of ours no longer uproot themselves.
[00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:17.380]   We are all hidden.
[00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:21.500]   We are there as it were, but there is so much fruit that we cannot be seen.
[00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:22.940]   Nothing is to be seen but the fruit.
[00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:24.740]   And it is seen in all the others.
[00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:27.860]   And there is this blessed, wondrous unity.
[00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:33.140]   Now let me just give you this before I close, in the words of the great apostle himself.
[00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:37.540]   In the fifth chapter of his epistle to the Galatians, he really does put this great point
[00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:40.060]   once and forever so clearly.
[00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:46.060]   He contrasts there, you remember, what he calls the works of the flesh and the fruit
[00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:49.740]   of the Spirit.
[00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:52.540]   Now let me put it to you.
[00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:59.860]   You see, it is all the difference between factory products and the life of the fruit
[00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:00.860]   of the Spirit.
[00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:08.060]   This is how he puts it now, "The works of the flesh are manifest, which are these,
[00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:12.620]   adultery, and at once you have separated a husband and a wife, and you have come in and
[00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:19.660]   have done something you should not have done, you have already divided, fornication, uncleanness,
[00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:27.660]   lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions,
[00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:34.780]   heresies, envying, murders, drunkenness, revelings, and such like.
[00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:37.020]   Every one of them divides.
[00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:42.040]   Of the witch I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which
[00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:45.700]   do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God."
[00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:46.700]   How can they?
[00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:54.580]   It is division, it is war, it is ugly, it is foul.
[00:39:54.580 --> 00:40:04.180]   But the fruit of the Spirit, and from the clanging of the machines, and from the scrap
[00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:13.380]   and the castaways, and all the division, and all the noise and the bustle, you suddenly
[00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:18.540]   look at the most glorious landscape you have ever seen in your life, and at a magnificent
[00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:25.100]   orchard, and there it is, it has come quietly and unobserved.
[00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:32.540]   While we were sleeping and nobody was doing anything, but the fruit of the Spirit is love.
[00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:38.660]   And love at once unites, and joy and joy unites.
[00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:42.940]   The woman who found her lost coin went out and said to her neighbors, "Come in, let's
[00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:43.940]   have a feast together.
[00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:45.940]   I found the coin that I have lost."
[00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:49.940]   And the shepherd who had lost the sheep said the same, "Joy, it unites.
[00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:53.580]   Peace, of course, it is the opposite of war and division.
[00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:56.700]   Long-suffering, we have already considered that.
[00:40:56.700 --> 00:41:05.900]   Gentleness, goodness, faithfulness, meekness, temperance, holding back that lust, that desire,
[00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:10.540]   that thing you want and the other wants it, and you fight because it is all held back.
[00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:17.140]   Control, discipline, the fruit of the Spirit.
[00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:24.700]   And when he gives this fruit, you see, and produces it, there is no room left for division
[00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:32.060]   or discord because there is one body and one Spirit.
[00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:42.340]   The unity is there, and our business is just with all lowliness and meekness and with long-suffering
[00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:51.340]   forbearing one another to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
[00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:58.740]   Next Sunday morning, great Sunday morning, God willing, I shall go on with this.
[00:41:58.740 --> 00:42:03.100]   I have not finished what I must say about the work of the Spirit.
[00:42:03.100 --> 00:42:10.020]   So we will celebrate, God willing, great Sunday morning by going on and seeing how he, the
[00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:20.220]   Spirit of peace and of unity, coming in the form of a dove always, inevitably, always,
[00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:27.820]   is the bringer and the producer and the maintainer of peace.
[00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:30.500]   Has he done his work in you?
[00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:35.180]   Has he done the work of preparation, the work of incorporation?
[00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:46.380]   Is he dwelling in you and is he manifesting his gracious, glorious fruit in you?
[00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:49.660]   Amen.
[00:42:49.660 --> 00:42:53.580]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
