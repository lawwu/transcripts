[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080]   We apologise for the poor quality of the following recording of a sermon
[00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.880]   by the late Dr Martin Lloyd-Jones.
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.320]   Although we have digitally restored this to improve clarity,
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.200]   the quality is not as good as we would like.
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.760]   We do apologise for this but nevertheless
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.360]   hope that this sermon will be a great encouragement and a blessing to you.
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.920]   I should like to call your attention,
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.240]   and the attention of many of you once more,
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:33.680]   to that great incident which is recorded in the third chapter of the book of Exodus,
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:40.720]   the chapter which we read at the beginning, which starts, you remember, like this.
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.600]   "Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian.
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.760]   And he led the flock to the back side of the desert,
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.840]   and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb.
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.640]   And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.480]   in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush.
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.960]   And he looked, and behold, the bush burned with fire,
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.040]   and the bush was not consumed."
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.640]   We began the consideration of this mighty incident last Sunday night,
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:25.040]   and I then explained that we were doing so because of its momentous character.
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:32.720]   It's one of those crucial incidents in the Bible which we ignore and neglect only
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.880]   at the greatest conceivable peril to our souls.
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.640]   An incident to which reference is made very frequently in the scripture itself.
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.160]   We are interested in it because it presents to us what is, after all,
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:54.160]   the great and the central message of the scriptures, and that is God's way of salvation.
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.040]   That's the one and only theme of this book.
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.920]   It states it in many different forms.
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.600]   But there is perhaps an advantage in having it in a particularly dramatic form like this.
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:13.440]   I'm never tired of pointing out the people who say that they can't see any gospel in the Old Testament,
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.200]   and who are sometimes surprised that one in a gospel service such as this
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.440]   should preach from the Old Testament.
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.320]   I'm never tired of saying that the real trouble with them is this.
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:31.200]   A man who doesn't see the gospel in the Old Testament is a man who doesn't see it in the New either.
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.600]   Because the moment a man sees this gospel in the New, he'll find it everywhere in the Old.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.120]   And there is no doubt that that is why the Spirit of God led the early church
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.760]   to include these Old Testament scriptures with their new scriptures
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.040]   to form this book which we call the Bible.
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.520]   It's the same God in birth.
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.400]   It's the same covenant in birth.
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.920]   It's the same glorious purpose in birth.
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.640]   And indeed there's a sense in which you can't understand the New except you have the Old
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.000]   and have some understanding of the Old and its basic principles and postulates.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.840]   So the result is that you get these great pictures,
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.480]   these great demonstrations, if you like, of salvation in the Old Testament.
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.760]   And there is none that is more notable than this one.
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:28.000]   I've suggested that in the very picture of Moses himself we have it all.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.800]   Here it is, you see.
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.680]   Here's a man who spent 40 years looking after sheep.
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:41.200]   One of the most humble, menial tasks a man could ever perform, especially in those days.
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.560]   Don't imagine that I'm saying anything against shepherds.
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.200]   I have a great likeness for them.
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.360]   Some of the best men in the world have been shepherds.
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.440]   But that was the kind of task and calling which it was at that time.
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.800]   Now this man, there was a man who'd been brought up as the child of Pharaoh's daughter.
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.960]   He'd lived in the court in Egypt and he had great prospects ahead of him.
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:11.200]   But you remember that he was a Jew and a Hebrew and he knew it.
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.320]   And though he had these marvelous prospects,
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.560]   he couldn't forget the people to whom he belonged and certain things concerning them.
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.200]   He'd been taught them in his youth, God's purposes with respect to them.
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:28.400]   So he, in a sense, forsook all that for the sake of his people.
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.240]   He was concerned to do something for them.
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.480]   However, the plan went wrong, you remember.
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.480]   And he had to flee for his life.
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:40.960]   And there he is in this land of Midian, 40 long years looking after sheep.
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.480]   And I've no doubt that he'd become thoroughly discouraged
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.040]   and long since come to the conclusion that nothing would ever happen.
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.040]   It would be the same humdrum experience for the rest of his life.
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.280]   And the great dream and vision he once had in his youth of liberating his people
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.760]   would never come to fulfillment.
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.080]   And so we just read, "In the most casual way,
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.720]   now Moses kept the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law, the priest of Midian.
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.600]   And he led the flock to the backside of the desert."
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.680]   Not a very promising place to go to.
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.880]   You wouldn't imagine there'd be much grass and fodder there.
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.280]   However, he'd probably exhausted the supplies elsewhere.
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.680]   He does this most ordinary thing in a most ordinary way on a most ordinary day.
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:31.360]   And suddenly, this amazing sight confronts him.
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.440]   A burning, flaming bush.
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.680]   And yet the bush was not consumed.
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.160]   Now, I say that the whole story of salvation is there.
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.960]   There's frustrated mankind.
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.440]   There's mankind that's become even cynical
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.960]   and who's come to the conclusion long ago
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.480]   the only thing to do in a world like this is to make the best of a bad job
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:05.360]   and just go on, come day, go day,
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.640]   keeping things going, not expecting anything to happen.
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.040]   Ah, that's what sin does to a man.
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.920]   It so crackles his soul and his spirit
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.240]   that he even gives up hope of ever being put right.
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.560]   He's down, he's out.
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:26.720]   And then, suddenly and when he least expects it oftentimes,
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.920]   this amazing thing happens.
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:34.160]   And he learns for the first time that what matters in this life
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:39.280]   and in this world is not what man does, but what God does.
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:43.120]   And he learns that God has done something
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.520]   and he's confronted by it and there it is.
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:50.080]   Now, last Sunday night, I called attention hurriedly and very casually
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.720]   to some of the general characteristics of this.
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:07:00.560]   In other words, the murest tyrant in these matters must see at a glance
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:05.920]   that the great message of the scripture is the message of what is called revelation.
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:12.960]   A man is just leading a flock of sheep and looking for the pasture
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:16.720]   and suddenly something arrests him, he's looking at something,
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.440]   something has appeared before him, revelation.
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:24.160]   That's the whole message of the Bible, isn't it?
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.120]   It is the revelation of God
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.520]   and the revelation of man and sin and the relationship of man and God.
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.800]   But it all comes from God, it's revelation.
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:42.560]   And what's gone wrong with us is that we've forgotten our fundamental procedure.
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:49.440]   We've all been talking about quest and seeking and searching and request.
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:56.000]   My dear friends, the gospel starts with an entirely different term, revelation.
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:59.760]   What God does, what God sends.
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:05.920]   And here on the very surface, we come face to face with some of the great characteristics
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:06.720]   of revelation.
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.920]   That's the first, that it's always from God's side.
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:14.800]   I must emphasize that, whatever the consequences.
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:20.240]   The Bible starts by telling you and by telling me this,
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:26.960]   that we are in such a state and in such a condition that we can do nothing about ourselves.
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:30.320]   You don't like that, that's the gospel.
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:39.360]   By grace are we saved, through faith, and that's not of yourselves, it is the gift of God.
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:45.520]   It's not an accident that the first word in the Bible is this, God.
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:49.360]   In the beginning, God.
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:54.160]   And that's the characteristic of the book, it's all from God's side.
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.200]   And then the next thing, obviously, is that you never know when it's going to happen.
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.960]   I like that.
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:03.120]   We always think we know, don't we, and we make our plans, but
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:07.440]   a man who's fast to his plans doesn't know the Bible.
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:13.040]   The people in the Bible were always getting surprises, as Moses had that afternoon.
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.760]   That was the last thing he expected, but it happened.
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:17.600]   You never know when.
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:22.560]   At any moment, most surprisingly, it comes.
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:29.280]   It's all of God, you see, and we can't understand, and we can't forecast, and we can't foretell,
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.360]   and we don't even want to if we know the Bible.
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:34.320]   But it comes in an unusual manner.
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:40.000]   Moses undoubtedly had his ideas as to how God would reveal himself if he did,
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.840]   but he never imagined it was going to be by a burning bush.
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:50.720]   But you read the history of the church, go through your Bible, and you'll find that that's God's way.
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.040]   He never thought anything in the way that we think.
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:57.040]   Who would have thought that when the Son of God left the course of heaven and came on earth,
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:04.000]   he'd ever to be seen lying in swaddling clothes in a manger in a stable?
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   That's what I call divine humor.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.200]   Do you know what that means?
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:13.200]   Do you know what that means?
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:17.520]   Well, the great apostle Paul, in the great burst of eloquence, puts it like this, you remember.
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:25.120]   That's his way, says Paul, that's God's way of making foolish the wisdom of this world.
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:28.240]   Unconfounding the wise.
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:31.600]   Sends his Son to a stable.
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.400]   Born of a virgin.
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:35.760]   Most unusual.
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:36.960]   Most unexpected.
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.720]   Ah, but not only that mysterious.
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.120]   This book is burning and yet it's not consumed.
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:46.640]   It's on fire and yet it's still there.
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:49.600]   Impossible, but true, mysterious.
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:55.680]   If you don't read your Bible whenever you read it with the idea that you're going to read mystery,
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.400]   it's not surprising if you get nothing out of it.
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:04.320]   Come to the Bible expecting the mysterious, for it is mysterious.
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:06.640]   It's the mystery of godliness, says Paul again.
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.760]   And then the next thing, of course, is that it's miraculous.
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:18.720]   I don't apologize for miracles, I assert them.
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:22.160]   I've not got through if miracles haven't happened.
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:26.720]   The whole of salvation is miraculous from beginning to end.
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:31.200]   We preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord,
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:34.640]   and the whole power of the God within him, and it's miracle.
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.160]   This was a miracle.
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.480]   His birth was a miracle.
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.080]   His resurrection was a miracle.
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:41.280]   He worked miracles.
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.240]   It's all miracles.
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:48.320]   And to become a Christian is to undergo a miracle because it means a rebirth.
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:52.080]   Well, all that is here in the burning bush, isn't it?
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.920]   That's where we left it last Sunday night.
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:57.200]   Well, now then, we must proceed from that point.
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:00.160]   It's all supernatural and miraculous.
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:05.440]   Now, there is a beginning, I say, and that is what happens.
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:10.400]   You consult any person who's ever become a Christian and formerly wasn't a Christian,
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:16.000]   and you'll find that in some super form and to some degree, that's been his experience.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.960]   Going along, doing his work, studying in his profession,
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:25.680]   running his business, living a married life,
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:29.120]   all the normal, ordinary things of the world.
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:30.240]   "Aren't you good?"
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:33.680]   The man may have had certain ideas, but no, they've long since gone.
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:34.400]   He's given up.
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.440]   He's just now managing to keep going anyhow, somehow,
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.600]   and he's reached a stage in which he expects nothing.
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:41.760]   Suddenly, he's arrested.
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.840]   Something pulls him up.
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:44.720]   It doesn't matter what.
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:48.480]   The forms are almost endless in their very action.
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:53.280]   But can we become arrested by the fact that there is something outside ourselves
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:57.120]   that is demanding our attention, something, someone, attacking us,
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:58.240]   and we don't quite know what?
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:05.360]   There are many in this congregation who know exactly what I mean.
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:11.120]   This great process sometimes starts in a very vague manner.
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:16.640]   A man just finds himself gradually becoming different.
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:22.480]   He doesn't know quite why nor how, but he loses a taste for the things he used to like,
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:25.680]   and he can't get the same excitement,
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:28.160]   the same peak as he puts it out of them, as he used to have.
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:32.640]   He's just aware that there's something happening to him.
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:35.600]   There is something there that he doesn't understand.
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:38.240]   He can't fathom it, but he's being disturbed by something,
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.400]   and he's being arrested by something else.
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:41.920]   Oh, it may happen in an endless number,
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:44.240]   whereas a friend may invite him to a service,
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:48.000]   or may ask him to go somewhere with him and listen to a message, and so on.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.040]   Well, there it is, and he's aware of being attacked.
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:54.000]   He's being arrested, and yet he doesn't know.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.840]   Now, that's excellent.
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:56.640]   That's the beginning.
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:00.560]   But you see, it's just at that point a very real danger arises.
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:06.800]   And that's the thing that is emphasized in this episode and in its account, isn't it?
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:12.720]   There's a very real danger at this point, and Moses fell into it.
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:16.400]   And Moses said, I read in the third verse,
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:20.560]   "I will now turn aside and see this great fight.
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:23.520]   Why the book is not burnt?"
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:31.520]   Ah, he was a very able man, Moses, learned in culture,
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:36.240]   and cultured in the law and the learning of Egypt.
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:38.800]   We are told that about him, a highly intelligent person.
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:44.800]   And suddenly he becomes confronted by a most interesting phenomenon.
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:49.200]   And Moses says, I will turn aside.
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.120]   I'll leave the sheet there for the time being.
[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:57.600]   I will turn aside and investigate this most entrancing, intriguing phenomenon.
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:02.160]   What a book the Bible is.
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:07.760]   How well it knows this, and how contemporary it is.
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:11.040]   What a perfect description this is of many a man.
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:15.600]   Ah, yes, you see, something begins to happen, and then what happens?
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:18.800]   Well, he begins to become interested in the phenomenon.
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:26.960]   I'm not sure sometimes that this isn't perhaps the great danger at this present hour.
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:29.760]   The interest in phenomena.
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:31.760]   Have you noticed it?
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:38.720]   I suppose it's an inevitable result when you have an exhausted condition in mankind.
[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:40.960]   And we are all exhausted, let's admit it.
[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:43.360]   The two world wars have exhausted us.
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:46.960]   We've been tried, our hopes have been keyed up so often,
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:52.400]   and the prophecies have been so brightened but they've never been verified.
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:56.000]   The whole world of mankind is in a state of exhaustion.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.760]   And always when you get people in that condition, they become interested in the odd.
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:02.720]   Interested in phenomena.
[00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:06.160]   There's a great deal of interest in phenomena today.
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:11.520]   I think people are much more interested in phenomena than they were, say, ten years ago.
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:13.760]   I mean by that when I use the term phenomena.
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:17.040]   They say the one thing that matters is does the thing work?
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:18.000]   Is anything happening?
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.280]   Is anything taking place?
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:23.440]   If it isn't producing results, and if it is, well, they're interested.
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:26.720]   Interested in phenomena, a bush that's burning and yet not consumed.
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:27.280]   What is it?
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:34.320]   There are many people who are interested in religion as a phenomenon.
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:39.840]   There are many people who are interested even in religious experience
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:41.920]   as a phenomenon worthy of their analysis.
[00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:45.600]   Look out for this in the coming days.
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:51.360]   You'll find secularly minded men will be very interested in phenomena.
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:53.920]   That's their only interest, isn't it?
[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:56.000]   Nothing else, not spiritual at all.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.240]   But they're interested in anything odd, unusual.
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:16:59.280]   They don't care what it is.
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:02.800]   If it's conjuring, if it's spiritism, it doesn't matter.
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:05.600]   If something odd, unusual, inexplicably is taking place,
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:07.760]   they're always there and they're interested.
[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:10.800]   As the apostle Paul says of them, they have each been years,
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:13.840]   and they always want to hear something new, like the Athenians have always said.
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:17.200]   If there's a new phenomenon, they're after it, they must see it and investigate it.
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:20.640]   Moses did it all before them.
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:21.600]   We've all done it.
[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:25.040]   We've all, not a necessity to plead guilty concerning it.
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:28.080]   This has come in phases.
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:31.120]   You know, there are people, and I've known some of them,
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:37.200]   who are very interested even in conversion as a psychological phenomenon.
[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:42.960]   I remember once preaching and a minister came to me at the end.
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:45.360]   I'm sorry I said he was a minister.
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:46.480]   He was, unfortunately.
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:50.560]   He came to me at the end and this is what he said to me.
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:54.320]   He said, "You know, I don't agree with a word of what you say,
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:57.680]   but I thought you were doing something in this service."
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:00.400]   I didn't regard that as a compliment.
[00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:04.000]   The man didn't tell me anything about myself nor my preaching.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.760]   He told me a great deal about himself.
[00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:09.280]   You see, he didn't believe my truth.
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:11.200]   He was virtually saying truth doesn't matter.
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.960]   What matters is that something happened.
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:17.520]   He felt something vague.
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:20.720]   He wasn't interested in precise definition, but phenomena.
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:22.320]   It's an interesting phenomenon.
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:25.920]   And conversion, people say, so they've written their psychological studies
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:29.520]   of conversion and they've attempted to explain it psychologically.
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:34.320]   Indeed, interest in religion itself can be something quite dangerous
[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:41.600]   if you merely approach it in this spirit of detached and almost academic inquiry.
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:46.160]   But, you know, yes, it is, after all, one of the experiences of life
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.000]   and therefore we must know something about it.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.720]   And, of course, if your country and if you yourself
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:53.120]   and if the world happens to be in a bad state,
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:55.840]   well, if religion's got something to say or something to offer,
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:58.720]   well, let's have a look at it and let's see what it has got to say.
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:00.480]   Let's have a look and see what's going to happen.
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:06.160]   Religion as a phenomenon, a subject of study,
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:10.480]   something that you look on objectively from the outside.
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:13.520]   Now, Moses, I say, had fallen into this trap.
[00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:17.760]   He said, I will now turn aside and see this great sight.
[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:22.080]   Why the book is not burnt.
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:26.640]   But the moment he said it, God acted and God spoke.
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:28.000]   God will never allow that.
[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:31.520]   And what I want to emphasize tonight is just this,
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:35.920]   that until you get out of that attitude,
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:39.200]   you'll never know the blessings of Christian salvation.
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:44.480]   You'll never know the greatest gift that even God has to give to men.
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:46.880]   That's a fatal attitude.
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:51.280]   And God saved Moses out of it by crying out unto him.
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:54.240]   And when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see
[00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:58.720]   in this spirit of speculation and mere intellectual inquiry,
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:01.760]   God called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said,
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:04.960]   "Moses! Moses!"
[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:10.880]   And Moses said, "Here am I. Here am I."
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:14.480]   And then God began to speak to him.
[00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:18.880]   But you see, before anything can happen to this man,
[00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:20.800]   before the message can come to him,
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:23.440]   he has to be arrested in this way.
[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:26.960]   And God said to him, "Draw not nigh either."
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:30.400]   Take the attitude at once.
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:33.280]   Put off your shoes from off your feet
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:40.320]   for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:45.280]   Now this is absolutely vital and essential.
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:49.840]   And my dear friend, if you don't come to that,
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:53.760]   I say that the rest I'm going to say tonight will have no value for you.
[00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:57.920]   The approach is all important in these matters.
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:01.280]   But having arrested him in that way,
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:05.680]   now God begins to proceed to reveal himself to him
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:06.720]   and give him the message.
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:07.760]   And what is the message?
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:10.640]   Well, here again is one of those great principles
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:12.560]   underlined in the Bible from beginning to end.
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:17.040]   God's first message to men in that condition is
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:21.520]   the truth about himself, about God.
[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:26.640]   What God did to Moses was to speak about himself.
[00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:30.320]   Now that comes first.
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:34.080]   And it must always come first.
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:38.480]   Now here again is the point at which we all tend to go wrong, isn't it?
[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:43.520]   We start with ourselves and our needs and what we want
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:45.840]   and what we desire and what we'd like to have.
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:47.760]   That isn't the first message.
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:49.920]   The first message is about God.
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:54.160]   And as I've already reminded you, that's what the Bible always does.
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:58.160]   The great message of the Bible is, I say,
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:01.280]   to remind us and to tell us that everything begins with God
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:02.880]   and everything ends with God.
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:08.560]   "Of him and from him and through him and unto him are all things."
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:16.640]   I was never so seriously tempted to stop singing
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:20.320]   as I've been in this service tonight.
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:24.560]   I almost said, "Now tonight, instead of singing these great words,
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:27.840]   let's recite them so that we can think about them."
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:30.560]   I'm very fond of music.
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:33.200]   Tunes appeal to me, but they can be dangerous.
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:37.520]   Because they carry us away, don't they?
[00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:38.800]   And we forget what we are singing.
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:44.640]   Take those great words we've already been singing in our three hymns.
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:49.200]   If only we realized the truth of those words,
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:54.560]   if we only really believed that what a transformation would take place.
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:56.880]   But we don't.
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:01.360]   And it's only, I say, to the fact that we forget
[00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:07.040]   the God about whom we are concerned and with whom we have to do.
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:11.520]   But the Bible is very careful to warn us against this,
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:15.440]   because this is its first and its greatest message
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:16.480]   at the very beginning,
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:20.560]   to tell us and to remind us without end
[00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:23.680]   that the whole trouble with man
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:28.400]   is due to his wrong relationship to God.
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:34.720]   It's so obvious, and yet it's the thing we forget above everything else,
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:36.800]   that is the essential message of the Bible.
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:41.360]   That everything that goes wrong in man's life,
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:43.360]   individually or collectively,
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:46.800]   is ultimately due to the fact that man is in a state
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:49.920]   where man is in the wrong relationship to God.
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:53.280]   And that if we ever want to be put right,
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:55.680]   we must of necessity start here.
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:58.560]   And I want to go further and to say this,
[00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:02.400]   that if we don't start correctly at this site,
[00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:03.920]   we'll be wrong everywhere else.
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:08.560]   Now, I want to put that in this form.
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:14.080]   The test of any man's claim to have the Christian faith
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:20.880]   is finally what he says and what he believes about God
[00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:24.320]   and about his attitude to God.
[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:27.680]   Now, I want to say a word in a special manner
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:29.760]   to evangelical people who are present.
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:35.120]   Often we evangelicals say to one another about a man,
[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:40.080]   "Ah, yes, he spoke well, he spoke eloquently, he was learned,
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:44.240]   but, you know, we say the man didn't even mention the name of Christ."
[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:47.280]   Well, of course, we're quite right in what we say.
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:52.560]   And us, there are men who seem to be able to preach out of the Bible
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:54.400]   and they never mention the name of Christ.
[00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.400]   Christians who never mention the name of Christ.
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:58.800]   We say, "He didn't even mention the name of Christ."
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:00.640]   Quite right, my friends, but, you know,
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:03.600]   your danger and mine is almost the exact opposite of that.
[00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:09.520]   I am almost afraid to say it, but I must say it.
[00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:12.960]   I sometimes think that I know Christians
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:14.640]   who never mention the name of God.
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:18.960]   I mean God the Eternal Father.
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:22.000]   They never seem to talk about him.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.400]   But that's to be utterly unscriptural
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:29.040]   and that indeed is to deny the message of the Bible.
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:32.800]   I say that the ultimate test of a man's profession of Christianity
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:35.920]   is what he tells me about God.
[00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:40.320]   Now, I'm going to tell you why I'm emphasizing this.
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:47.920]   It is because we forget God, incredible though it may sound,
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:52.880]   that our methods go so wrong so frequently.
[00:25:52.880 --> 00:26:00.400]   Our message, the Church's message, it's because God is forgotten.
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:07.520]   It is because we forget God that there's so little true holiness
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:10.080]   and godliness in the world at the present time.
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:12.960]   I'm speaking of the Church as well as the world outside.
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:19.920]   We don't even use the term godly very frequently.
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:25.520]   We talk about people being keen instead of saying that they're godly.
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:29.280]   And you can be keen without being godly.
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:32.160]   And if God isn't there at the beginning,
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:34.960]   a man won't know why he needs to be put right with God.
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:39.600]   He wants a blessing, but what he needs is to be right with God.
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:45.520]   So, if we don't start where God himself starts, how can anything be right?
[00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:53.920]   And it is because we forget God that we're no longer interested in doctrine.
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:27:00.000]   That's the great tragedy of the Church in the last hundred years,
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:07.120]   her increasing loss of interest in doctrine, the great doctrines of the faith.
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:10.800]   And it's all because we don't start with God, we start with experience.
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:14.240]   We start on the experiential, the experimental level.
[00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:17.520]   And we're always anxious to get people to get something.
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:20.080]   My friends, we start by proclaiming God.
[00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:25.760]   And we do so because he does it himself.
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:30.560]   "Moses, Moses, draw not nigh,
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:38.320]   hither put off thy shoes from off thy feet; for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground;
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:42.320]   and then I am the God of thy fathers."
[00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:44.240]   And so on.
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:53.440]   May I say it again at the risk of being misunderstood?
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:02.880]   The whole business of Christianity, its first business, its fundamental business,
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:11.520]   its final business, is to bring us face to face with God.
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:18.320]   And a supposed gospel that doesn't bring men face to face with God
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:21.760]   is not a gospel, it's something else.
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:28.480]   And something else can give results, but this, its special concern is to bring us,
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:34.320]   as Moses was brought there, face to face with God, with God himself.
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:39.440]   I asked the question last Sunday night, I don't apologize for asking it again.
[00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:43.200]   Have you met God?
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:46.720]   Do you know God?
[00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:50.640]   Have you come face to face with God?
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:53.520]   That's the biggest question you'll ever face,
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:58.000]   and I press it upon you because the day is coming when you'll have to face him.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:06.640]   If this book is true, every one of us will come face to face with God.
[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:11.600]   And the business of the preacher is to get men to do it now,
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:16.480]   while the door of salvation is still open, and while they still can be reconciled to him.
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:20.400]   Well, very well, what does God tell us about himself?
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:23.440]   Let me remind you of some of the things that we are told in this chapter.
[00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:24.960]   I'm not going outside it at all.
[00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:29.920]   What God reveals, in other words, is something like this.
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:33.920]   First of all, he gives this great revelation about himself, his own being,
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:36.480]   if you like, his own name.
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:45.920]   We must learn to go back to the Bible and to read it and to watch the names of God.
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:53.840]   "I am," he says, "the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac,
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:55.440]   and the God of Jacob."
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:57.600]   And did you notice how he kept on repeating it?
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:00.560]   He's talking about himself.
[00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:02.800]   He's giving this revelation about himself.
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:06.240]   Yes, but then that great statement, "Poor Moses."
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:07.040]   He was alarmed.
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:07.840]   He was terrified.
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:08.960]   He couldn't understand all this.
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:10.080]   He was overwhelmed.
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:13.520]   And he says, "When I go and say that the God of our fathers has sent us,
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:15.280]   they'll say, 'What's his name?'"
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:23.600]   And God said, "Tell them, Moses, 'I am that I am.'"
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:30.640]   Do you know, my friends, I'm almost afraid to say these things.
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:34.480]   For I'm standing on holy ground and you are.
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:40.400]   And I'm talking like this, the pygmy that I am, in this pulpit,
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:44.320]   about this great and eternal being.
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:46.320]   "I am."
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:48.640]   That's all.
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:49.280]   "I am."
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:51.520]   Nobody else can say that.
[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:55.440]   "I am what I am.
[00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:57.360]   I am that I am."
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:03.440]   All the authorities say that it might be translated also, "I shall be what I shall be."
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:04.160]   Of course.
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:07.040]   If he is what he is, he will be what he will be.
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:08.560]   He was what he was.
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:10.080]   It means his eternity.
[00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:17.680]   The eternal and everlasting God.
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:21.360]   The self-existent God.
[00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:24.160]   The changeless God.
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:28.400]   The God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob.
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:30.720]   The God that was, the God that will be.
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:32.020]   God.
[00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:37.680]   How often have we stopped to think of that?
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:47.520]   How often have we paused to contemplate the being, the character, the nature, the attributes of God?
[00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:50.160]   Well, he revealed them to Moses.
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:55.040]   "Whom shall I say, 'Say, I am, hath sent me.'"
[00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:59.440]   The one who created everything out of nothing.
[00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:02.880]   The God who said, "Let there be light."
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:04.080]   And there was light.
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:07.840]   The power of God.
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:15.040]   His strength, his might, his absolute qualities and potentialities.
[00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:18.480]   The being of God.
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:22.160]   The majesty, the greatness of God.
[00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:27.200]   Go through your Bible and observe what happens to men who have come anywhere near God.
[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:28.480]   They all fall to the ground.
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:30.720]   They all get afraid as Moses did here.
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:31.680]   They hide their eyes.
[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:34.240]   They put their hands upon their mouths with Job.
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:35.280]   They say, "Hide us."
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:42.000]   The sight, the thought of God, the mere hem of his garment, if I may use that anthropomorphism,
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:42.560]   is enough.
[00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:45.200]   The majesty of God.
[00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:49.520]   No man shall see God and live.
[00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:56.320]   Even this man who was given this special revelation, this man Moses, when God put him in the cleft of
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:33:00.000]   the rock, he was only allowed to see his hinder parts, as we are told.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.800]   No man can look into the face of God and live in a world like this.
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:07.760]   That's God.
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:11.040]   And then is holiness.
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:21.040]   "Take off, put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:24.160]   is holy ground."
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:28.480]   Who can describe the holiness of God?
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:31.760]   Well, the Bible is full of its terms and its illustrations.
[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:37.840]   "God is light, and in him is no darkness at all."
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:39.520]   No, you and I can't conceive of that.
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:43.040]   We don't know of any light that has no darkness in it.
[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:48.400]   Our brightest lights have darkness in them, because you can always have a more powerful
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:48.960]   one.
[00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:53.920]   The fleck of the explosion of the atom is nothing when you put it by the side of this
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:57.040]   God is light, essential light.
[00:33:57.040 --> 00:34:02.000]   God is light, essential light, and in him is no darkness at all.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.560]   Can you imagine what that means?
[00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:13.120]   God is of such a pure countenance that he cannot look upon sin.
[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:19.440]   Our God is a consuming fire.
[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:26.000]   Now, people are troubled, they tell me, by this whole concept of law, and they can't
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:31.760]   see why before a man can be saved and reconciled to God you need to have this doctrine of the
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:34.640]   atonement and the death of the Son of God upon the cross.
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:37.040]   They say they can't see any necessity for this.
[00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:38.080]   Do you know their trouble?
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:39.600]   I'll tell you, their trouble is this.
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:44.400]   They have no conception at all of the holiness of God.
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:46.800]   That's their trouble, nothing else.
[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:49.280]   You see, how vital it is to start at the beginning.
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:53.600]   How can a man believe the doctrine of the atonement if he hasn't understood the doctrine
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:54.640]   of the holiness of God?
[00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:55.360]   He can't.
[00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:56.880]   I don't expect him to.
[00:34:56.880 --> 00:35:01.120]   I can understand he's getting some sort of an experience, but he can't understand
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:06.960]   the cross and why the Son of God rarely has to die if he doesn't start with an understanding
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:09.520]   of the utter, absolute holiness of God.
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:17.440]   And you see, what salvation really means is this, dwelling in the presence of God, having
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:22.640]   communion and fellowship with God, and as the Apostle Paul again argues so perfectly,
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:26.960]   there is no communion between light and darkness.
[00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:28.000]   There can't be.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:33.440]   There is no mean, even as Aristotle put it, there is no mean between two opposites.
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:34.400]   It's impossible.
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:36.800]   There seems to be opposites, if you can find a mean.
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:42.960]   And God is unutterably holy.
[00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:52.240]   And heaven is a place that is absolutely holy, without any sin, without any blackness and
[00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:57.760]   darkness, and we are told that without holiness no man shall see the Lord.
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:03.280]   If I may venture, dare to say such a thing, my friend, the doctrine of the atonement is
[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:12.240]   an absolute necessity for this reason only, that God cannot tolerate anything sinful in
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:13.040]   his presence.
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:14.240]   It couldn't live there.
[00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:15.520]   It would be crippled.
[00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:17.680]   It would burn into nothingness.
[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:22.480]   And before I can be in the presence of God, I must have the holiness of God himself.
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:30.000]   You see, it's a waste of time to be arguing about miracles, and as to who Cain's wife
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.760]   was, the problem is this.
[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:35.600]   How can you stand in the presence of that burning light?
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:38.400]   That's the question.
[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:49.680]   How can men in sin have any fellowship and communion with this holy and eternal being?
[00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:53.520]   But thank God the revelation he gives doesn't stop at that.
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:57.120]   He goes on to tell us about his own covenant and his purpose.
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:01.760]   Did you notice some of these tender things that were said here?
[00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:03.440]   I haven't time to deal with them tonight.
[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:08.880]   I merely give you a little list to go home and think about and to face and to meditate
[00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:09.920]   about and to ponder.
[00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:15.920]   Just think of it, my friends, this God whom I've been trying to describe to you so feebly,
[00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:23.840]   this eternal being, this absolute being, this majestic, glorious God, who is so holy that
[00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:25.360]   we can't conceive of it.
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:30.880]   Did you notice what he said about himself?
[00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:43.520]   "I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard
[00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:48.160]   their cry by reason of their taskmasters."
[00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:56.240]   And then one of the most tender moving things, I think, in the whole Bible, "For I know
[00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:57.360]   their sorrows."
[00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:02.400]   We talk about paradox.
[00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:04.560]   That's paradox.
[00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:18.960]   This almighty, everlasting, holy, eternal God sees you and me, hears our crying and
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:22.640]   our tears and our groaning and our wretchedness.
[00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:25.920]   He knows our miseries.
[00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:30.320]   He tells all this to Moses.
[00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:34.800]   Think of his pity.
[00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:37.760]   Think of his compassion.
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:45.280]   And then he goes on to outline and to reveal his great and gracious purpose.
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:45.920]   Listen to him.
[00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:49.280]   You don't find the gospel in the Old Testament.
[00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:50.000]   Listen to this.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:56.320]   "And I am come down to deliver them."
[00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:58.960]   That's Bethlehem.
[00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:00.960]   God coming down.
[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:06.720]   He's announced it here, and he came down many times before Bethlehem in what are called
[00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:11.360]   the theophanies, in these appearances of the angel of the covenant.
[00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:19.360]   But the whole movement of salvation is just that God, this eternal being, coming down
[00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:31.360]   to mankind in its wretchedness, its pity, its slowly, its pain in sin, and coming down
[00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:32.320]   to deliver.
[00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:36.400]   Yes, and I end with this.
[00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:40.800]   He revealed also the certainty of the plan.
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:43.600]   I rather like this.
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:48.400]   He gave Moses the mandate, and he told him what he was supposed to do.
[00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:50.000]   But then he went on to say this.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.880]   He said, "And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go."
[00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:58.320]   No, not by a mighty hand.
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:01.440]   And I imagine Moses saying, "Well, very well.
[00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:04.000]   You're raising my hopes, and now you're dashing them again.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.440]   I've given up long ago.
[00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:07.920]   I was afraid of Pharaoh and what he might do to me.
[00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:13.120]   You gave me a new hope, and now you say you're certain that Pharaoh will not let us go."
[00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:13.840]   You're right.
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:14.800]   I know he won't.
[00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:17.680]   But listen.
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:26.480]   "And I will stretch out my hand and smite Egypt with all my wonders, which I will do
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:28.080]   in the midst of Pharaoh.
[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:32.960]   And after that, he will let you go."
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:34.880]   And he did.
[00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:39.520]   As far as I'm concerned, that's the whole gospel.
[00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:47.760]   You and I and all of us as the result of sin are in the hands of someone infinitely more
[00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:51.200]   powerful and infinitely more fiendish than Pharaoh, the devil.
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:52.960]   The devil.
[00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:55.040]   The god of this world.
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:57.040]   And you've tried to fight him.
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:58.400]   You've tried to get free.
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:01.520]   You've tried to make new resolutions and turn over a new leaf.
[00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:05.600]   You've put your back into it all, and you've failed, and you've failed miserably.
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:07.440]   And the gospel seems to say, "Here's a way out."
[00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:08.800]   You say, "How can I?"
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:10.320]   And here's the answer.
[00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:11.680]   He will let you go.
[00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:15.920]   And when the Son of God came down, he defeated him.
[00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:18.960]   And he's bound him.
[00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:27.600]   And in Christ, all are free from the kingdom of Satan and have been translated into the
[00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:29.840]   kingdom of God's dear Son.
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:36.960]   That's the gospel, the message which tells us that this almighty eternal being
[00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:46.080]   has looked upon us, has looked upon you, knows you, sees your vain, futile struggling and
[00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:51.200]   endeavor, hears your sighing and your groaning in your captivity of sin.
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:53.120]   He hears it.
[00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:54.400]   He feels it.
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:58.240]   He knows your sorrow.
[00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:07.200]   And because of it, he sent his only Son down amongst us into this world.
[00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:10.960]   He came as a babe and lived as a man.
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:18.800]   And he fought the devil and finally ran for him on the cross, and answered the law, and
[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:23.200]   fulfilled all its demands, and God punished your sins upon him.
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:32.560]   And neither the devil nor hell, nor anything else, can prevent your knowing the glorious
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:34.480]   liberty of the children of God.
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:43.760]   If you but believe this message and accept the offer of salvation in Jesus Christ, the
[00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:44.640]   Son of God.
[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:46.480]   Amen.
