[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.760]   Well, hello, Everyday Educators.
[00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:13.020]   I hope this podcast finds you celebrating the end of the current homeschool year, maybe
[00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:19.920]   trading in your sneakers for a pair of sandals, and possibly noting when your local practicum
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.840]   will be taking place this summer so that you can continue to be equipped and encouraged
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.220]   on your home education journey.
[00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:33.360]   My name is Kelly Wilt, and I currently serve as the lead of program development for Classical
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.020]   Conversations Multimedia, as well as a challenge director in my local community.
[00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:47.580]   But another of my favorite roles within Classical Conversations is emceeing our own annual National
[00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.360]   Memory Master Competition.
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:56.820]   This competition is designed to cement and celebrate memory work mastered by our foundation
[00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:04.300]   students on their final tour before moving on to Challenge A. And this past week, our competition
[00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:11.040]   was held in Southern Pines, North Carolina, where we crowned a new National Memory Master
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.780]   Champion for 2025.
[00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:20.800]   And if you were able to follow along on our live stream, you bore witness to many amazing
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:29.260]   feats of memory as our 16 finalists tackled question after question with diligence, excellence,
[00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.740]   and grace.
[00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:40.300]   So today, it is my pleasure and joy to introduce you to our 2025 champion, Evangeline, and her
[00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.760]   parents, Jason and Tricia Tracht.
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.700]   Welcome to the Everyday Educator.
[00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.160]   Hey, thank you so much for having us, Kelly.
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.680]   We're excited.
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.780]   Absolutely.
[00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:58.200]   Well, first of all, Evangeline, let me say congratulations on being the 2025 National Memory Master
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.840]   Champion.
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:06.540]   After all of the preparation you did beforehand, as well as handling the pressures of the competition,
[00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.400]   how did it feel when you heard your name announced as the winner?
[00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.880]   I was so shocked.
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.260]   It was one of the best moments of my life.
[00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.120]   I was, I didn't really know who was going to win.
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.080]   And I was like, kind of like really nervous.
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.120]   And then he said my name and it was, it meant a lot to me.
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.840]   Well, I will say the look on your face was pure joy and surprise coupled together.
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:36.580]   And it was so encouraging to see all of the finalists just wrap you up in a giant hug.
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.400]   And some of them, I think, tried to lift you off the ground because everyone was so thrilled.
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.920]   And I think that's one of the lovely things about the National Memory Master Competition
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:54.720]   is that spirit of teamwork and togetherness and friendship that we see evident with our finalists.
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.160]   So, you know, Classical Conversations is a family made up of families.
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:07.640]   And that is truly evident in the way that we love and support each other at National Memory Master,
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.500]   both before and during and after the competition.
[00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.380]   So, Jason, tell us a little bit about your family.
[00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:16.340]   Yeah.
[00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.220]   So we live here in Jacksonville, Florida.
[00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.560]   So we've, you know, Tricia and I have been married for 15 years now.
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.660]   Our anniversary is coming up.
[00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.560]   Yeah, we have the four kids.
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.660]   So Evangeline's our oldest.
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.680]   So at 12, it's a two-year cadence.
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.640]   So we have a 12-year-old, a 10-year-old, an 8-year-old, and a 6-year-old.
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.720]   So Evangeline has two younger brothers followed by a youngest who's a sister.
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.420]   So Josiah, Nehemiah, and Elizabeth.
[00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.940]   So obviously, Tricia stays home and homeschools the kids.
[00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:46.820]   No surprise there.
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.960]   And I work for a financial company.
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.440]   And so helping people make wise financial decisions.
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.920]   But yeah, so we've lived here our entire married life.
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.440]   Tricia's lived here our entire life.
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.740]   I'm actually from out on the West Coast and grew up in Washington State.
[00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:05.760]   But yeah, we love living here, being a part of our community here and loving life.
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:06.780]   Wonderful.
[00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.060]   Tricia, I know that homeschooling is a full-time job.
[00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:16.380]   Tell us, how did you find out, how did your family find out about Classical Conversations?
[00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.220]   And share with us a little bit of your family's CC story.
[00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.720]   Okay, so we knew that we wanted homeschool.
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.200]   My husband was homeschooled.
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.460]   And we were actually both Christian school teachers.
[00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.440]   So we knew we wanted to homeschool.
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.840]   And so I had a friend actually on social media.
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.740]   And I had never met her in person.
[00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.640]   It's just a social media friend.
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.140]   But she was local to my area.
[00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:43.100]   And she would post all the time about this Classical Conversations that she was doing with
[00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.280]   her children and learning Latin, all of these things.
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.200]   And she would explain it.
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.180]   And I was like, that sounds amazing.
[00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.920]   What is this?
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.200]   And so I reached out to her.
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.960]   And she encouraged me to reach out to the local director, which I did.
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.620]   So I met her.
[00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.420]   And then I came to that first practicum.
[00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:04.100]   And seeing the Challenge Kids, because the year that I came to the practicum,
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.640]   they had a panel of Challenge Kids.
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:11.360]   And they were asking them questions and asking them about college and their future.
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:17.340]   And just listening to them answer how intelligently they answered and thoroughly.
[00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:23.580]   And they seem to have just loved learning and gained so much knowledge and wisdom.
[00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.560]   I was so impressed by that.
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.040]   And then one of the seniors' mothers actually spoke.
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:34.260]   And when she explained what homeschool could be, I was so excited.
[00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:39.140]   Because coming from that teacher background, I, Corey Evangeline at four years old, like
[00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:45.020]   when I did pre-K at home, it was like, okay, 8 o'clock this, 8.30 this, 9 o'clock this.
[00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.680]   It was just, I had this schedule, right?
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.200]   Because I had this teacher mentality.
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:53.040]   And I think I thought at first, it's supposed to be just school at home.
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.060]   And I didn't really grasp the homeschool aspect.
[00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:02.560]   And so when she explained, listen, we do CC, we review it for like 10, 20 minutes a day,
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:07.920]   and then do a math curriculum, do a reading and writing and language curriculum, and you're
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:08.520]   good to go.
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:09.460]   And I was like, really?
[00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:10.740]   That's it?
[00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.020]   It streamlined it for me.
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.920]   And I found the beauty of just starting our mornings around the table with the Bible.
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.880]   And then we go into CC review.
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.780]   And it was just, it was eye-opening to me.
[00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:30.360]   And I've been so encouraged with CC and just how it's impacted my children, that we're classically
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.520]   learning, but it's Christian-based, and we're doing it as a family.
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.500]   It's just been so rich.
[00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.040]   So that's kind of our CC story.
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.440]   I love that.
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:46.080]   I hear just remnants of our family's CC story or echoes of our story and yours too, because
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:52.380]   I was a, I am a former public school teacher, and I subjected our firstborn to much of the
[00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:57.900]   unnecessary rigor that I think I attached to the idea of what education needed to be.
[00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:04.140]   And I also had a gracious friend who helped open my eyes, not to what schooling is, but
[00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:05.980]   what education can be.
[00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:07.940]   And so I love that.
[00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:08.600]   I love that.
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:14.040]   And I hope that your story is an encouragement to perhaps other families who, you know, are
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:17.340]   coming into this and wondering what is Classical Conversations?
[00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:18.700]   What can it be?
[00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:21.340]   And what can I expect for my family?
[00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:27.960]   So Evangeline, you're going to be headed from the familiar world of foundations into
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.420]   Challenge A in the fall.
[00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:34.380]   And I'm curious, how old were you when you started foundations?
[00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:40.860]   And then could you tell me, were you a national memory master, a national, were you a memory
[00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:45.820]   master from the very beginning or was it something you decided later to do?
[00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:54.940]   So I started foundations when I was five, almost six, and I didn't want to do memory master until
[00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:57.680]   like my first year of essentials.
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.340]   And so I've only done memory master three times.
[00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:01.400]   Okay.
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.280]   Okay.
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:03.460]   You know, it's funny.
[00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:10.160]   Every year we have a broad spectrum of students who enter the competition and we have some memory
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.320]   masters who've done this eight times.
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:16.440]   And I love that you've been a memory master three times.
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:22.140]   You mastered each cycle, I'm guessing, because it gave you the skills that you needed to succeed
[00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:23.080]   in the competition.
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:27.920]   And I know it will give you the skills you need to succeed and challenge A in the fall.
[00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:34.560]   So I'm curious, what made you decide to send in an entry to national memory master this year?
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:43.200]   Well, I mean, we knew about it from a friend and we heard about it and I was like, that sounds
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.200]   like an interesting thing to do.
[00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:45.580]   Like, that would be cool to try for.
[00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:50.480]   And so about a year ago, we were like, I should try for this.
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.720]   And so I started like memorizing this year's cycle.
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:58.480]   And then in like either January or February, we started making my video and I was excited.
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:01.400]   I was nervous and I didn't really know what it was about, but I was excited to see what
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:01.840]   it was like.
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:02.740]   Wonderful.
[00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:08.300]   Well, it sounds like your spirit of curiosity paid off literally and figuratively because
[00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:11.600]   you walked home with a $10,000 check as your prize.
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:18.820]   You know, I think your story is really encouraging because I've heard of families who decide not
[00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:24.080]   to do this because they are intimidated by the process or they think, you know, we've only
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:29.600]   been involved in foundations for maybe three or four years and we've not done this or at least
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:34.460]   memory mastered from the time that, you know, the student was four years old.
[00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:40.560]   And so I think you are living proof that, you know, when you commit the memory work to memory,
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.900]   that three years is enough.
[00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:45.700]   So congratulations and well done to you.
[00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:46.920]   Okay.
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:53.080]   So this is a question for you, Tricia, as the mom, was pursuing National Memory Master something
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:57.720]   you encouraged Evangeline to do or was it her idea?
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.280]   Tell us a little bit about that.
[00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:04.280]   So like she said, we had actually heard about it because a friend in our community,
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:08.360]   her son actually made it as a finalist.
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:11.460]   So that's where we first heard about the National Memory Master part.
[00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:13.880]   And I think it was in the back of our mind.
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:15.520]   And then I just presented it to her.
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.340]   Hey, is this something you want to do?
[00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:21.460]   Like she said, over the summer and she's like, yeah, I want to try for that.
[00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:24.200]   So that's kind of led into it.
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:31.580]   And it was, I feel like it was a very wonderful process of just trying to break things down and
[00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:36.320]   figuring out when to study things and for it not to be overwhelming and just to refresh
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:37.280]   her mind on things.
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:46.240]   So a lot of families that become involved in National Memory Master at the very beginning
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:50.360]   have a lot of questions about the entry submission process.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.620]   And I know that, you know, when, when you think about submitting an entry for National Memory
[00:10:55.620 --> 00:11:01.620]   Master, it's, it's really intimidating for one parent and the student to do alone.
[00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:06.760]   And you need someone behind the camera and you need someone who can introduce the student
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:08.620]   on the entry video.
[00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:14.500]   So Jason, I know all three of you were involved in crafting Evangeline's entry video.
[00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:17.420]   What was that process like for your family?
[00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:23.440]   It, it was actually a lot better experience than it, than we were thinking it might be.
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:27.980]   We knew, okay, this might take a lot of takes.
[00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:33.420]   And so we were really blessed.
[00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:38.300]   Like she made, she, we, the first couple of times, you know, she worked on scripting it
[00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:40.420]   out memorizing and was ready to go.
[00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:45.180]   Trisha asked me, she goes, can you be the one who gets like, I'll run the camera, you
[00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:45.780]   get in front.
[00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:51.020]   I have to confess, I chickened out and I was so scared of messing it up.
[00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:54.400]   Cause I was like, what is she, what if she does it and I mess up my part.
[00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:59.560]   So I wrote it up on a piece of paper, like behind the camera, which leads to another funny
[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:00.320]   story down the road.
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:04.280]   But she, she got it her third try.
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:05.540]   Way to go.
[00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:10.220]   Make sure that that's not discouraging for other people.
[00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:13.700]   Like apparently if you want to win, you've got to have your, your entry done by the third
[00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:14.040]   try.
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:19.760]   No, we went back and watched the video and, and Trisha was like, they cannot have anything
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:21.660]   written and they can be disqualified.
[00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:24.880]   The entry can be disqualified if it's like, they think, oh, she's reading something.
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:27.500]   They're like, and you can clearly see I'm reading something.
[00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:29.300]   So we're like, oh no.
[00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:31.000]   What have I ruined?
[00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:38.040]   And so she tried it a bunch more times and about five times in, we were like, okay, never
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:38.320]   mind.
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.320]   We're, we're going to work.
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:44.300]   And so that was actually, honestly, that was the most stressful part of the entire process
[00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:44.880]   was waiting.
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:51.860]   She got, got accepted because I was literally living deep down inside going, what if I just
[00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:52.580]   ruined this?
[00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:58.180]   Because I wasn't able to memorize three sentences when my daughter just memorized, you know, everything.
[00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:04.220]   So that, that was, that was definitely not my finest moment, but it was, it was definitely
[00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:10.180]   the three of us working together, obviously Evangeline doing 98% of the work, 99% of the
[00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:15.140]   work, but Trisha just set her up for success, helped her practice, got a little scene set
[00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:16.260]   up so she could be happy with it.
[00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:23.200]   And yeah, apparently don't be afraid, like take a little bit of time, dad, to like memorize
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.440]   what you're supposed to say.
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:26.740]   Because it didn't take me long once I decided to do that.
[00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:27.660]   Absolutely.
[00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:33.680]   I will say it is very humbling to serve as the MC each year and to see them, you know,
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:38.760]   reciting the timeline backwards and, you know, doing all these incredible things.
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:43.220]   And there quite often are times when I can't remember the four items that I need to pick
[00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:44.640]   up at the grocery store.
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:51.780]   And so it's really humbling for me as an adult to see, to observe in real time, the beauty
[00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:57.280]   of how God has designed our minds at different ages to be able to capture that information.
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:59.580]   So that is, that is hilarious.
[00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:05.660]   So dads, you know, you hear Jason here, make sure you just take dominion over memorizing
[00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:08.740]   those three sentences that you need to, to be able to support your family.
[00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:09.960]   I'm like, well, excellent.
[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:11.200]   All right.
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:16.000]   Evangeline, I know, you know, your dad has just alluded to the hard work that it is for
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.300]   us to be able to help support those entry videos.
[00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:24.480]   But I know it takes a lot of hard work to become a national memory master.
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:31.000]   When you found out that you had been selected as a finalist, tell us what types of things you
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.380]   did to be able to prepare to compete?
[00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:39.820]   Well, I, we split up the work, the memory work, like between the days of the week.
[00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:44.100]   And so like Monday, I would do two subjects Tuesday, I would do two subjects and so on.
[00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:47.560]   And then we took timeline cards and we put them all around our house.
[00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:51.160]   That was like, that was the winning factor for me.
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:54.340]   That was the only way I was probably going to be able to do the timeline backwards.
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:59.480]   And so that helped extremely with the visual picture, because I would just like tap each
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.460]   one and like go forward around our house and then go backwards.
[00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:03.720]   And like, I would like point to where each ones were.
[00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:08.120]   And then eventually I started going backwards with it, like from memory saying it.
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:09.320]   And so that helped a lot.
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:17.800]   And then about maybe a month before the competition, I started working on maps.
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:21.300]   And so I would like trace a certain continent until I can memorize it.
[00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:25.700]   And then I would eventually, I got a bunch of poster boards and then I would like draw the
[00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:26.840]   whole world on it from memory.
[00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:29.160]   And mommy would time me and each time I got better.
[00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:30.120]   So that helped a lot.
[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:31.960]   Nice, nice.
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:37.060]   I think you hit on one of the things that is most fascinating for families when they consider
[00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:38.620]   entering National Memory Master.
[00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:43.040]   It's how do you commit some of these things to memory in new ways?
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:50.000]   And I love the fact that you used location as a memory peg for you with the timeline cards.
[00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:55.080]   And you're bringing back to my mind, a winner that we had a few years ago who actually took
[00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:59.480]   the timeline cards and put them all up the stairwell in their home.
[00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:03.340]   And so he would go up the stairs and he would recite the timeline forwards.
[00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:07.120]   And then he would go down the stairs and he would recite the timeline backwards.
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:11.940]   So I think it's really what you're saying is encouraging for families to just be creative
[00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:16.580]   and think about committing that information to their minds in new ways.
[00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:23.620]   And I love the fact that you practiced drawing the maps and drawing portions of the map until
[00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:24.860]   you had mastered it.
[00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:29.640]   And then you kind of were mapping the mastery of the map as you move from place to place.
[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:32.020]   That is a really great tip.
[00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:39.960]   So as we've already said, you know, preparing for National Memory Master is not something a student
[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:45.560]   does all alone from the beginning of the entry video until the time that they step on the
[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:47.560]   platform at competition.
[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:55.200]   So, Tricia, I'm curious, in what ways did your family and your community surround you guys and
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:57.120]   show support for you and Evangeline?
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:05.480]   Well, one thing we had her do, so we knew she knew the knowledge and she is an actress.
[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:12.540]   So she loves being on stage in front of people, but she loves playing a part in being on stage
[00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:13.360]   in front of people.
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:16.900]   When it is her on display, it's different.
[00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:20.760]   So I knew that was one of the things that she would struggle with.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:27.040]   So at first I would pretend to be a judge and I would say, okay, I'm a judge and I'm going
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:27.680]   to ask you a question.
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:32.380]   And I would purposely give her a look on my face like she had gotten it wrong to try to
[00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:39.580]   throw her because she's so in tune to my expressions that I knew that that could kind of throw her
[00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:39.800]   off.
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.860]   And then I feel like the Lord just kind of like, hey, try this.
[00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:49.420]   And so we actually, the last four weeks, I believe, of our CC community this year, I would
[00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:54.120]   pass out questions and I would word it just the way that you guys word it in the championship
[00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:56.640]   out to other tutors and parents.
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:02.420]   And during our assembly time, like at the end with assembly filled with the students and tutors,
[00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:08.540]   she would stand on the stage with a mic and have these other parents ask her some of the
[00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:09.000]   questions.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.300]   And I think the first time she did it, she got it all right.
[00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:14.680]   But the first time she did it, she was shaking.
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:17.760]   It was like, you could see her knees like knocking.
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:18.700]   Every time.
[00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:24.660]   So it was great practice because it really put her like on the spot.
[00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:26.880]   It's like, oh, wow, they're all looking at me.
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:28.600]   I'm not pretending to be someone else.
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:30.560]   And I'm having to answer this question.
[00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:31.500]   So that was huge.
[00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:36.520]   And I love it too, because I feel like it encouraged the other kids in assembly.
[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:41.020]   Like, look, you can do this and you're having a part of it right now because you're helping
[00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:44.340]   fill out the crowd to put her in this circumstance.
[00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:45.840]   And so it was just really neat.
[00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:51.140]   And then the other thing, our family and friends and part of our community, there was a surprise
[00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:53.600]   parade for her the day that we left.
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:56.260]   So they just, I never even heard of this.
[00:18:56.260 --> 00:19:02.260]   I love the idea, but just a drive by parade and they made posters encouraging her and decorated
[00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:03.080]   with balloons.
[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:07.820]   And it was just, I feel like it was just what she needed to, to have the encouragement to
[00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:08.760]   go to the competition.
[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:15.480]   All right, you guys, so it's that time again, we need to talk about the math map, but this
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:20.260]   time we need to talk about the math map as it relates to monomials.
[00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:24.340]   Monomials is our newest introduction to the math map family.
[00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:33.580]   And this curriculum helps families practice introductory algebraic computation together by using classical
[00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:38.920]   skills that prepare students for the mathematical conversation of the ages.
[00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:39.940]   That's right.
[00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:47.240]   In the monomials curriculum, you are going to learn introductory algebra aligned with a natural
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:48.360]   learning patterns.
[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:54.200]   This curriculum empowers parents as the primary math teachers with layered support.
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:20:00.040]   It creates a unified math language for that one room school house feel and community learning.
[00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:03.220]   And it also centers around Christ.
[00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:10.540]   This Christ centered approach of God's mathematical design is essential for learning and appreciating
[00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:11.180]   math.
[00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:17.900]   The monomials curriculum is for students 13 and older, and it is specifically used for challenge
[00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:19.300]   B and beyond.
[00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:24.040]   If you want to learn more about this resource, please visit classicalconversations.com
[00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:29.180]   forward slash the math map today to transform your family's math experience.
[00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:30.840]   Now let's get back to the show.
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:32.580]   Oh, I love that.
[00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:36.880]   How wonderful to see your communities surround you in that way.
[00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:42.660]   And I think you hit on something really important, Tricia, just getting used to the idea of being
[00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:47.940]   that person behind the microphone and having the questions asked in a different way than when
[00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:52.820]   you're proofing for memory master and you're sitting next to your mom or dad on the couch or across
[00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:57.700]   from a tutor that you know really well or a director that you know really well in community.
[00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:59.280]   I think that's brilliant.
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:05.780]   And what a great idea to have a parade.
[00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:09.060]   And I think that you got to Southern Pines for the competition.
[00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:15.760]   So thinking about the competition, Evangeline, tell us a little bit about your National Memory
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:21.200]   Master experience because I'm listening to your mom talk about your knees knock, and I didn't
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:24.800]   see nerves for one moment of the competition.
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:28.240]   So tell us, what was the hardest part of round one?
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:34.200]   It was definitely not making any mistakes and just like getting everything right.
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:39.160]   And I kind of, I had to take a deep breath and just kind of like set my mind and think of
[00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:42.480]   what the answer was before actually saying it because I was afraid I was going to mess up
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:43.480]   or say the wrong thing.
[00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:44.280]   Sure.
[00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:45.520]   Sure.
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:51.420]   It is a different thing to stand behind the microphone and to be able to recite the memory
[00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:54.200]   work and then, you know, waiting for your turn.
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:59.660]   As, you know, we move through the finalists, I can look up on the platform and see the different
[00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:04.600]   expressions on the faces and see like everyone, you're like, oh, two more, two more finalists
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:05.640]   and it's my turn.
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:12.460]   And one of the reasons why in competition, I tell everyone, let's take a big, deep breath
[00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:13.060]   together.
[00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:16.880]   I think it helps us just to settle nerves a little bit.
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:22.800]   Sometimes we would take two or three breaths together, depending on what we're about to do.
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:28.300]   But it's important for you guys to know that as the MC, I'm sitting here just as another
[00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:33.280]   CC mom asking you questions, just like you were in community.
[00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:38.900]   So, you know, one of the things that I said in competition this year was, I want you to
[00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:43.520]   think about that fun tutoring community who always makes things so special.
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:46.660]   And I want for you to think about that tutor space right here.
[00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:51.720]   So as I'm asking you questions that you're thinking about that person and you're thinking
[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:53.660]   about your community experience.
[00:22:54.220 --> 00:23:00.780]   So Evangeline, you had no errors in round one of the competition and that is just extraordinary.
[00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:06.360]   So what helped you to focus and remember your memory work in the different heats?
[00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:08.120]   I know you said you took a deep breath.
[00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:11.580]   Was there anything else that you can remember that was helpful to you?
[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:17.940]   I mean, when we were proofing, I would sometimes make mistakes and I almost was glad for those
[00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:21.540]   mistakes because then when I would answer those questions, I thought about the mistakes that
[00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:22.000]   I had made.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.540]   And so I didn't make those mistakes.
[00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:26.740]   And I kind of zoned out to where I stared at the wall behind the people.
[00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:28.200]   So I wasn't looking at anyone.
[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:36.520]   I like that idea of looking beyond the faces because sometimes when you look at the faces,
[00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:38.140]   that makes you more nervous.
[00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:43.400]   And I know your mom's already alluded to that, that she was being really careful with her face.
[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:48.520]   And that's something as the emcee, I'm really careful about too, because if a finalist makes
[00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:53.560]   an error, the first error doesn't eliminate them from competition, but the second one does.
[00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:58.740]   So when that first error happens, and even when the second one happens, I try really hard
[00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:04.020]   to keep smiling and trying to encourage you guys so that you'll keep pressing forward.
[00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:12.340]   So, you know, I know, I've heard from many National Memory Master families that during the competition,
[00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:17.040]   that the parents quite often feel more nervous than the kids.
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:21.960]   And I will say as the emcee, I think sometimes I'm more nervous than the kids are too.
[00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:29.440]   So Jason and Tricia, both of you, as parents watching her tackle these different types of
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:34.780]   heats during round one, you know, how did that feel as you were watching?
[00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:41.080]   Because the other day I sat and calculated all of the questions that we asked during round
[00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:46.220]   one, we actually asked 220 individual questions.
[00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:50.320]   And of the 220, only 20 of them were incorrect.
[00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:56.600]   So how did it feel to see her up there doing all of these different types of heats during
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:59.640]   round one and then move on to round two?
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:04.400]   Well, first of all, I didn't make eye contact with her.
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:07.820]   So I would look at her when you asked her the question.
[00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:12.420]   And then as soon as she started to answer, I was like, because I didn't want it because
[00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:15.640]   I was nervous, but I didn't want her to catch my eye and that to throw her.
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:18.240]   So I just, and then I would look up when she was done.
[00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:25.540]   But from everything that I saw, I was so taken aback by how composed she was.
[00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:32.000]   And even though inside she may have been real stressed on the outside, she was so composed
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.300]   and she answered those questions.
[00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:36.840]   And I was just so extremely proud of her.
[00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:44.560]   I feel like she had a truly joyful spirit through it all and a humility of, I'm just up here
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:45.120]   having fun.
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:47.200]   I'm going to, I'm going to do my best.
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:50.540]   But at the end of the day, I'm here to glorify God.
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:55.800]   And that, that left such an impact on me, especially with round two and how she performed in round
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:56.180]   two.
[00:25:56.180 --> 00:26:01.000]   I just watching my little girl up there, give it all for the glory of God.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.720]   And, and with just this huge smile on her face and such composer, I, composure, excuse
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:06.900]   me.
[00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:10.600]   I could not have been prouder of her, no matter what the outcome was.
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:12.620]   She just really impressed me.
[00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:13.220]   Yeah.
[00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:19.500]   It was funny because about round four or five, I suddenly looked at her and realized she looks
[00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:21.280]   like she's enjoying herself.
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:25.880]   And another parent said like, you know, she goes, I know she goes, I just kept expecting
[00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:28.080]   her to say, and how are you doing today, Kelly?
[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:38.500]   But I, I really do think it's, and Tricia was a huge part of this, but from the very beginning,
[00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:41.280]   we really sought to go, okay, we need to be prepared.
[00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:42.100]   Yes.
[00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:48.920]   We need to set her up for success that it's like, when we reach that week, okay, we did the
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:53.680]   work, we didn't go overboard to where she's sick of it, to where it's like, I gave up on
[00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:57.800]   the rest of life, but we did the hard decisions of doing it on the days where it's like, I don't
[00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:02.340]   want to, I'm tired where we're in the car and it's right in the car, but just doing the
[00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:04.320]   steady, strong work all the way through that.
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:04.500]   Yeah.
[00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:08.300]   By the time I didn't catch this until the day before or until we were on the road headed
[00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:12.100]   there, is that it wasn't a stressful week.
[00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:13.120]   There was no cramming.
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:17.120]   It was just, okay, here we are.
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:19.000]   She knows what she knows.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.540]   Now it's just a matter of going out there and doing it.
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:27.900]   But we, we really, really wanted to stress with her and we knew we'd done a good job
[00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:31.700]   when our six-year-old daughter said it like a few days before we left, she's putting the
[00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:35.760]   dishes away and she goes, Evangeline, remember you already won.
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:45.660]   And yeah, it was really something where we, we, we wanted it to be that this is going to
[00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:46.560]   shape your character.
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:47.640]   Yes.
[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:52.360]   Regardless of how this plays out, that it's like, imagine the worst case scenario, imagine
[00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:55.660]   the best case scenario is God's sovereign.
[00:27:55.660 --> 00:28:02.420]   And therefore he's, he has a path for you on this and he's going to work it for his glory
[00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:06.620]   and he's going to do his work in you and shape you through it.
[00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:07.880]   There is no losing.
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:14.120]   And just, that was something we, from like when, before we got out of the car to go in,
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:16.420]   it's like, all right, here we go.
[00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:19.120]   And we just gathered around and prayed.
[00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:21.900]   And I think that's one of the things that's, we have to really watch yourself as you're having
[00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:27.220]   to focus so much on the practical aspect of practicing that you have to go, no, hold on,
[00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:29.040]   let's, let's recenter.
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:32.500]   And I think she was able to hold to that the entire time.
[00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:35.920]   The, yeah, once you're in, it was like, it was kind of, I said to myself, well,
[00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:40.120]   she's already won and she's given this joyous experience.
[00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:42.080]   Oh, that's so wonderful to hear.
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:47.280]   And I think you hit on some, both of you hit on so many things that are crucial to success
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:51.560]   at National Memory Master, because there will only be one winner, even though there are 16
[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:56.220]   finalists that come from all over the country in order to be able to compete.
[00:28:56.220 --> 00:29:01.940]   And you're right, my goodness, when they have taken the time and the effort and energy to commit
[00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:08.640]   this memory work to their hearts and their minds, they are winners before they even step foot on the
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:09.160]   platform.
[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:17.680]   And I think that spirit of just love and peace and encouragement is so prevalent at National
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:18.420]   Memory Master.
[00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:25.640]   It's always a blessing to see when the finalists come in and they start greeting each other and
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:29.900]   they don't look at each other as competitors because you're right.
[00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:35.280]   If your purpose in coming to National Memory Master is to beat out 15 other people and take home a
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:42.920]   check, you have missed an incredible opportunity to help shape your child's character, to shape the
[00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:47.100]   way that they think about winning and the way that they think about losing.
[00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:50.340]   Because like you said, it is in God's hands.
[00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:58.120]   And so what an encouragement to our families at home to think about this as more than a financial
[00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:05.940]   opportunity, to think about this as a moment of eternal significance in the lives of their children.
[00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:07.120]   I love that.
[00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:12.780]   So Evangeline, you know, when you think back over the entire competition, I know you have so many
[00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:15.080]   wonderful memories.
[00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:21.840]   I know just from watching you with the other finalists, you guys, just every single picture I've seen from
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:30.240]   the event has just made my heart so full of joy to see the love and the support that you guys had for each
[00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:30.700]   other.
[00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:34.500]   But I want you to think for just a moment about what was hard.
[00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:39.180]   What was the hardest thing of competing in National Memory Master?
[00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:44.940]   And then was there anything that really surprised you that maybe you weren't expecting when you competed?
[00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:49.500]   Well, one of the hardest things for me was the math, actually.
[00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:52.080]   The times tables, I kept messing up.
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:54.860]   And I was like super worried that I was going to mess up on stage.
[00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:58.140]   And so I got the AIDS, which I was pretty strong on.
[00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:03.940]   But like some of the other ones, I was like, and then it was also very hard when people got
[00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:08.020]   out because, you know, your heart, you're so sad for them.
[00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:12.320]   And sometimes just the hardest thing to do is what to say to them.
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:14.180]   And sometimes just a hug is all you can give.
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:21.240]   And then some of the stuff that surprised me was, one, how fast I went with round two.
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:23.280]   I've never said the timeline so fast.
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:24.440]   I was like so stressed.
[00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:25.880]   I was like hyperdrive.
[00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:29.080]   And then I drew the map like so fast.
[00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:32.760]   I was there like five minutes and I had labeled everything an extra.
[00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:37.740]   And I was almost thinking to myself, man, there's so much I could label in five minutes.
[00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:39.060]   I don't know what to label now.
[00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:42.340]   I love that.
[00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:42.880]   I love that.
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:49.020]   I think that, you know, your perspective on the your friends, I can call them your friends
[00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:53.200]   because I've seen your interactions with them who may have been eliminated.
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:59.060]   I think that really shows a sensitivity of spirit to the fact that they put in that hard work
[00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:04.560]   at home before they came to the competition, too, and just supporting them in a way that shows
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:09.680]   love to them in what is, you know, a moment of sadness, I think is really kind.
[00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:13.420]   And I will agree with you about the surprising nature.
[00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:15.220]   And I feel surprised every year.
[00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:20.020]   This was the I think the eighth time that I've emceed National Memory Master.
[00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:28.640]   And every year I'm blown away in round two by how quickly you guys can recite the timeline.
[00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:36.260]   And just for if you're listening to this podcast in round two, our finalists, our four remaining
[00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:41.800]   finalists who advance from round one will be given three and a half minutes to recite as
[00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:44.900]   much of the timeline as possible from a given point.
[00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:51.380]   And if they reach the end of the timeline, which I can assure you they all do, they come back
[00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:55.980]   to the beginning and they continue reciting until the time expires.
[00:32:55.980 --> 00:33:03.960]   And Evangeline, I'm pretty sure that you got through the timeline almost two whole times in
[00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:05.500]   the three and a half minutes.
[00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:06.720]   And that's amazing.
[00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:12.720]   We actually actually had one father of a finalist come up to me afterward and say, classical conversations
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:15.200]   is missing on on a great opportunity.
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:16.460]   What's next?
[00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:18.680]   CC auctioneering school.
[00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:28.340]   Just how quickly you can articulate and enunciate those events shows your mastery of them because
[00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:33.000]   you're already thinking about the next one in your mind before it even crosses your lips.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.360]   So I'm with you, friend.
[00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:36.200]   That was surprising to me, too.
[00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:39.380]   It continues to surprise me every year.
[00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:44.900]   So I'm curious, you know, Jason, Tricia, both of you, now that now that the experience has
[00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:50.480]   passed, I think I asked Tricia you the other day if you guys had come down from cloud nine yet because
[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:53.540]   it was such a wonderful, positive experience.
[00:33:53.540 --> 00:34:00.940]   What benefits do you see for Evangeline and your family through your preparation and participation
[00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:03.380]   in National Memory Master this year?
[00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:10.020]   And then I may know the answer to this already, but now that it's over, do you look back and
[00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:11.780]   think, I think I would do that again?
[00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:18.220]   I'll answer the second question first is absolutely all, all with her.
[00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:18.800]   Yes.
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:23.820]   All three of our younger kids are now like, we're in, we're doing this.
[00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:24.900]   Here we go.
[00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:32.600]   And it really plays into like, it's an interesting spot for us because they literally can't do
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:33.540]   better than she did.
[00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:36.140]   Like you feel like what you want it twice.
[00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:36.600]   I don't know.
[00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:39.200]   It's like, there's, there's no other, there's, there it is.
[00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:45.980]   There's the finish line and gold medal, which I think drives us back to what we really like.
[00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:47.240]   Why do we want to do this?
[00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:51.240]   And it will be such a temptation for them to be like, I'm going to go do what she did.
[00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:54.740]   And I'm going to get this big check and everyone's going to get around me and give me a big hug.
[00:34:54.740 --> 00:34:56.540]   And it's teaching.
[00:34:56.540 --> 00:35:01.620]   I think several things that are so huge is we want them to do hard things because to build
[00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:06.480]   the kingdom of God, exercise dominion, like you mentioned earlier, it's hard work.
[00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:12.740]   We live in a fallen world and it's like, we're called to seek wisdom and to strive and to go.
[00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:17.380]   And that, yeah, every single one of our kids will want to pursue it.
[00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:23.960]   Now that they've seen the joy of it and they're going to, they're going up against 15 amazing
[00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:24.360]   kids.
[00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:27.580]   It was a weird point when I sat there and saw her up with those kids who we've gotten to know
[00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:33.800]   a little bit, met their families the night before and looking and going, that's an amazing,
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:36.180]   amazing group of kids that you don't go.
[00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:37.500]   I don't know if my kid can do it.
[00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:39.320]   You're just going all 16 of them can.
[00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:43.320]   And so it's, you know, it's like watching two Superbowl teams.
[00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:43.840]   It's okay.
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:45.240]   Well, they're both great.
[00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:46.260]   So I don't know why I'm going to win.
[00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:46.920]   Yeah.
[00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:48.040]   16 of them though.
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:55.460]   But so for them, it's like whether their video does not win a 16 finalist spot, whether
[00:35:55.460 --> 00:36:00.240]   they go and get out early or they just don't make it to the second round or they make the
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:00.500]   mistakes.
[00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:01.200]   Like I know that.
[00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:08.520]   And whatever that level is that the going back to what we said earlier is like, God wants
[00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:10.140]   to use us to do great things in you.
[00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:15.800]   And I think it's, it's not very often in life that we get with our children, especially
[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:16.580]   younger children.
[00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:23.500]   And I want this for all of them is the ability to go, you have put in time and energy pursuing
[00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:25.340]   something that is good.
[00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:28.800]   And then for it, not go the way you want it to go.
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:34.260]   And it's just a huge job because they are going to have that happen in their life.
[00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:39.860]   So to put them in a spot where we're there to coach them through it and guide them and
[00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:40.700]   shepherd them through it.
[00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:42.960]   We absolutely want that for all of them.
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:48.480]   And then now probably their biggest reason is the competition's a neat experience, but she
[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:53.200]   now has 15 people that she knows that she's connected with and has a clear experience.
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:59.040]   And I mean, she has, I mean, she has friends that I'm just not going to be surprised if quite
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:02.320]   a bit of them are her friends that they're all six years from now going.
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:05.020]   And so we're all going to North Carolina for the graduation, right?
[00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:11.320]   So yeah, we want that for our kids too, is it really is the mindset that Trisha and I
[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:17.200]   are blessed from getting to be around other parents from very, very different parts of
[00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:21.040]   the country, very different, just life experiences and just what we do.
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:29.040]   And yet just the community of there's so much shared value and pursuit that we've made friends.
[00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:33.840]   And so for our family, we joked, we're like, if we keep this up, we're going to have like
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:35.640]   a network of friends all over the country.
[00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:36.620]   We're just going to take a road trip.
[00:37:36.620 --> 00:37:43.600]   So for us, it's, it's an absolute, there is no loss to having them.
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:47.780]   They're going to, they, and you know, we're not going to force them to go for national memory
[00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:50.520]   master, but from this, they'll probably be hooked on it.
[00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:56.300]   And so that it's worth it for them to pursue it regardless of the outcome.
[00:37:56.300 --> 00:38:01.640]   Our younger ones came home and the first thing they did when they got in the house is they
[00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:03.700]   grabbed a piece of notebook paper, a piece of paper.
[00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:04.900]   I started drawing the map.
[00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:10.140]   We're definitely like encouraged to pursue it.
[00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:16.420]   And you know, her younger brother, one of her older younger brother, who's 10 is planning
[00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:18.860]   on trying for it in a couple of years.
[00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:23.000]   So that will be a really neat experience because some of the other contestants also have younger
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:23.400]   siblings.
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:30.700]   So it may be a reunion sooner than six years, but just like Jason said, them learning how
[00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:37.420]   to do hard things and then watching and witnessing her dedication and that little by little consistency
[00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:40.980]   and really, I mean, that just teaches them so many lessons.
[00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:47.660]   And I, and I think also a bigger thing too, is just the fact that we did pray before so many
[00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:53.460]   things and we prayed for the competition that there would be peace and clarity and joy
[00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:56.580]   among all the contestants, that there would not be any confusion.
[00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:58.020]   And they were witness to that.
[00:38:58.020 --> 00:39:00.800]   And then they got to see God honor that prayer.
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:03.720]   And I feel like the competition, it couldn't have gone better.
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:05.960]   I feel like there was peace and joy.
[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:13.860]   And I mean, watching, watching her be embraced by those 15 other kids and some of them leaping
[00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:19.300]   off of their feet and swimming down, you know, pumping their fist, a few of them picking
[00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:19.860]   her up.
[00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:22.020]   I mean, it was just, it was amazing.
[00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:27.000]   And I feel, I just, I give it all credit to God and our routine is the answer to prayer.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:31.820]   And so for our kids to see that they can be in something, they can compete, they can face
[00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:36.900]   their fears, they can work diligently, but knowing the whole time that, that God is in control and
[00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:38.200]   that he's sovereign over it all.
[00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:43.860]   And just giving him the glory for it all, I feel like a huge blessing that we got from
[00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:44.440]   the competition.
[00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:45.400]   Amen.
[00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:51.740]   It is always one of my favorite things to go back after the event and review all of the video
[00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:55.620]   footage and the photos that are taken at the moment that the winner is announced.
[00:39:55.980 --> 00:40:02.140]   And I have to say, seeing the picture, seeing the video of you and Jason rising to your feet
[00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:07.800]   and cheering for your daughter is one of my favorite video clips from the event.
[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:12.400]   And also at that moment, like Evangeline, I don't know if you were aware of this, like
[00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:17.980]   your, your face just lit up and your hands went up like, oh my goodness.
[00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:23.960]   But it is so dear to me that one of our other finalists just reached over with her arms and
[00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:26.460]   just enveloped you in this big bear hug.
[00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:33.680]   And you can tell by the look on her face, she was genuinely thrilled that her friend had
[00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:36.680]   just been awarded this incredible honor.
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:43.640]   And so as the MC, it is a blessing to see what you're saying, Jason, and what you're saying,
[00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:46.780]   Tricia, that the rewards are eternal.
[00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:53.520]   You know, I know this summer in practicum, the theme is, you know, looking at things that
[00:40:53.520 --> 00:41:00.200]   are unseen, that we're trying to see the unseen and, you know, that love that the finalists
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:06.460]   have for one another through those relationships that they cultivate is so obviously seen in
[00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:08.760]   the way that they responded in that moment.
[00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:17.080]   It just is a beautiful testimony of families who have coached their children through this
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:22.260]   difficult thing that they're about to do and how we can take those moments and we can just
[00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:24.620]   offer them up as an offering to the Lord.
[00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:26.680]   So what an encouragement.
[00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:31.980]   Now, speaking of encouragement, Evangeline, I have one final question for you.
[00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:38.620]   If there's a foundation student who maybe is getting ready to enter into their last year
[00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:45.920]   of foundations in the fall and they're thinking, I just don't know, should I do this national
[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:47.800]   memory master thing or not?
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:54.120]   If you could give any words of wisdom to them, what would you say?
[00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:59.380]   It's definitely hard work, but it's most assuredly worth it.
[00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:04.420]   And just to be at peace with whatever God has planned for you.
[00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:09.200]   It's most important to remember that it's not about winning, but it's about glorifying God
[00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:13.440]   and that you're going to make memories that are some of the best memories of your life.
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:16.500]   You're going to carry with you for all your life.
[00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:21.360]   And then just that he's going to use that in your life to teach you things and encourage you
[00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:22.560]   and build your character.
[00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:24.820]   Yes, I love that.
[00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:25.520]   I love that.
[00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:28.460]   So as Evangeline says, go for it.
[00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:33.600]   You never know what moment of surprise might await you.
[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:36.960]   You never know what growing opportunity might await you.
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:42.500]   And I will say from this year, you never know what joy is awaiting you.
[00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:49.900]   So take the plunge and make that video and submit for National Memory Master of Competition 2026.
[00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:55.140]   So as we wrap up this episode of the Everyday Educator, I hope that you are as encouraged
[00:42:55.140 --> 00:43:01.680]   as I am, as you hear these words of wisdom from Evangeline and Jason and Tricia, and that
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:08.240]   if you're going to be in your final year of foundations come this fall, consider entering your own story
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:10.940]   for National Memory Master in 2026.
[00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:17.660]   Keep learning, keep growing, keep educating, and we'll see you in the next episode.
[00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:18.320]   Goodbye.
[00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:19.940]   Bye.
[00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:20.040]   Bye.
[00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:20.120]   Bye.
[00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:20.200]   Bye.
[00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:20.500]   Thanks.
[00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:20.760]   Bye.
[00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:20.760]   Bye.
[00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:20.800]   Bye.
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:20.840]   Bye.
[00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:20.880]   Bye.
[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:21.880]   Bye.
[00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:21.880]   Bye.
[00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:21.880]   Bye.
[00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:22.880]   Bye.
[00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:23.380]   you
[00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:23.880]   you
[00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:25.940]   you
