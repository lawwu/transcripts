[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   You talked about moral victory. Can you explain how your morality contributes to
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.600]   the way you see the value of winning? Sure. I think there's absolutely such a thing
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.040]   as a moral victory and sometimes people that are trying to manipulate you or
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.900]   trying to get you to buy something will tell you differently and you know there
[00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.360]   is there it goes in two directions. For instance let's say you're a blue belt
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.600]   and you compete against you know a real black belt and there's plenty of people
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.360]   running around black belts that are not particularly at this point but you know
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.280]   let's say for instance you're a blue belt and you compete against a real black
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.480]   belt the likelihood of you winning is almost zero. However if you go out there
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.160]   and you try hard and you do your best and again whether you come off the mat
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.440]   you know a winner which would be very fortunate and unlikely but or you come
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.320]   off the mat you know on the other side of things if you went after it and you
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.720]   tried and you you know let's say you had some nerves but you kept that in check
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.280]   and you fought hard you didn't let it get the better of you you know that
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.080]   would be in my opinion a moral victory and and there would be nothing wrong for
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.080]   recognizing it as such. Now that's not the same thing as an actual physical
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:04.320]   victory but there's nothing wrong with saying let's say your your opponents 260
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.720]   pounds and you're 120 and you tie they get the decision hey you know I mean
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.200]   remember that happened to me at the quarterfinal or not the quarterfinal
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.500]   rather in the the third round at the absolute in the worlds in 2008 you know
[00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.360]   and you know it was against a heavyweight or super heavyweight and
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.040]   ended up 0-0 and I wasn't happy about losing by any stretch of the imagination
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.720]   but looking back I'm like okay well you know generally speaking if you end up
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.680]   level considering that I have all of the resources you don't that is you know you
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.600]   definitely performed a little bit better than I did now at the end of the day you
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.520]   know wins and losses do matter and you do want to try to make sure that I'm not
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.640]   shooting for the moral victory I'm shooting for the actual victory but
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.680]   every now and then it's very very important to keep in mind that you know
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.600]   am I just asking myself am I conducting myself in a way that I respect that
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.360]   hopefully other people of value or respect and also a way that I believe is
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.520]   going to produce actual victory and actual positive results in a long run as
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.920]   well I think it's important to recognize that because sometimes you'll see people
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.920]   get very frustrated let's say for instance if I box against people that
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.320]   are much more experienced than me all the time you know I'm not going to win
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.480]   that anyone that tells you differently has is either not training with people
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:14.120]   that are very good or be they have no idea what they're talking about but what
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.040]   I can say is hey did I do a little bit better today and better doesn't mean
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.720]   that I did I land more punches necessary was I more under control was I more able
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.920]   to kind of keep my keep my focus and execute what I wanted to execute and if
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.600]   the answer to that is yes you know I'm moving in the right direction so as far
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.200]   as I'm concerned there's all sorts of different types of moral victory but it
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.880]   would be the the same thing as you know let's say for instance you know Fedor
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.600]   slaps your mother you got to hit him you have to he's going to kick the shit out
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.640]   of you almost certainly but you have to hit him it would not be it would be a
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.560]   technical like well I didn't get hurt so that's a win if you ran away but that
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.520]   would be the opposite of the moral victory in that case trying your best
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.760]   and losing would still be I would say the honorable thing to do so what you're
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.320]   saying is sometimes you have to pay the price for a moral victory absolutely but
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.880]   the reality is is that martial arts it doesn't just teach us about how to beat
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.460]   someone up or technique or this or that that's really not the core of the
[00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.960]   martial arts the core of the martial arts is heart discipline dedication
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.400]   focus and if you have those things they'll always be people better than you
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.000]   and they'll always be people lesser than you but that's not the only metric by
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.920]   which you can judge performance or judge a person
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:28.920]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
