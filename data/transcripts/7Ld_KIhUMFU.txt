[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.280]   Why are we all walking around beating ourselves up and not taking bold actions?
[00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.840]   Is it that people don't know that that's what you need to do?
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.160]   And that's your life's work?
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.280]   Or is it that it's actually really hard and there are easier ways to do it?
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.480]   Or maybe it's both.
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.560]   It's a great, it's a great, it's a great question.
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.160]   Um, I think a lot of people, if you intellectually ask them,
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.840]   should, are those things good to do?
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.080]   They'd be like, oh yeah, just like eating my vegetables and working out
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.080]   every day and spending time slowing down on plugging for my phone
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.120]   and connecting with my spouse.
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.680]   Yeah, that's awesome.
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:28.120]   It's great.
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.480]   But are we doing all those things?
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.880]   Right.
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.240]   And the reason we don't, just like we don't do all those other healthy habits.
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.480]   Well, maybe some people do, but the reason it's a challenge to do something
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.480]   that sounds very simple is because there's an emotional, uh, driver
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.960]   underneath the surface and each one has a payoff.
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.920]   The bold, I start with the bold action.
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.600]   There's a huge set of payoffs for not taking bold action.
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.680]   And one of the payoffs is we get to avoid the thing that everyone by
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.360]   default is trying to avoid in life, which is pain.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.360]   And so when we take a bold action, we're going to experience
[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.480]   a variety of forms of pain.
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.840]   Some of it's just discomfort, you know, to wake up, to focus, to take the
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.520]   action, to consistently follow up.
[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.400]   It's, it's, there's a discomfort to that.
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.360]   And then there's an emotional discomfort of what if they don't like my show?
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.120]   What if someone doesn't agree with me?
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.400]   What if someone criticizes?
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.040]   What about if my work's not good enough?
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.360]   What if I'm rejected?
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.240]   It all comes down to that.
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.560]   Disapproved of rejected.
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.240]   And most people are so afraid of that.
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.600]   And even unconsciously avoiding that, that they push the action to later.
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.080]   They, they make it way smaller.
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.880]   They delay it.
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:38.520]   They hesitate.
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.000]   And they don't even necessarily know that that's what we're doing, right?
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.680]   It's just like, no, I'm busy now this, but underneath I'm scared.
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.360]   And then we got our, you know, we don't want to, we want to look macho.
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.040]   We don't want to say we're scared.
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.720]   So we say I'm stressed and I'm too busy.
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.280]   So that's the payoff for the bold action.
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.200]   You might say, what is the payoff for treating yourself bad?
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.360]   I mean, obviously that's, that's terrible.
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.760]   Well, I would say that it actually serves the same master.
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.480]   So when I tell myself that's going to fail, I'm not good.
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.560]   I didn't do that right.
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.120]   That's creating this, uh, it's almost like a fog and amnesia.
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.920]   I kind of forget my strengths.
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.280]   I say, I'm sure you've done that.
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.800]   I've done that.
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.680]   It's like two in the morning.
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.880]   And the way you're seeing yourself is like this helpless, incompetent person.
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.200]   You're like, wait a minute, that's weird.
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.240]   Why am I even believing this?
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.720]   Because the more we believe that we, uh, stay in this kind of shell, it's like a
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.680]   protective walls of this negative identity.
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.600]   I'm a nobody.
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.240]   Who am I?
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.280]   And that nobody who's nothing is even further from taking that bold action.
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.800]   And all of this is, is under the umbrella of what I call your safety police, which
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.840]   is a, like a mechanism in your psychology.
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:48.560]   You could think of it.
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.040]   That is its purpose is single fold.
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.400]   It is to keep you safe.
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.720]   And the safety police is like a survival mechanism inside that's run amok.
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.800]   It's, it's just too high.
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.160]   The dial is set too high.
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:06.280]   And so safety means no pain, no rejection, no threat, no danger, no risk.
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.640]   And so you tell yourself you're a nobody and you avoid the action and you get to
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.080]   stay in that bubble, which feels safer in the moment.
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.600]   Of course, meanwhile, your life is passing you by.
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.720]   So it seems like both of those are a little bit like, uh, like this voice in
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.960]   your head, this inner critic that is kind of controlling you.
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.880]   Is that a fair assumption?
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:26.720]   Yes.
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.960]   Yeah.
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.240]   The inner critic, you could think of it as like the mouthpiece of the safety police.
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.760]   It's the one who's kind of narrating.
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.080]   And the crazy thing is like, why do people believe it?
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:41.120]   It's almost like, because it's familiar and also because it has proximity, you
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.680]   know, it's, it's coming from in your head.
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.480]   And so it's like, you're, it's closer than your closest friend.
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.520]   And so like, where is that?
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:48.000]   Okay.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.040]   I guess that's true.
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.560]   And I'll often do that with clients.
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.160]   I'm like, where is that voice coming from?
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.960]   And they're like, what do you mean?
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.080]   Like, it's from my childhood.
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.040]   I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.520]   Right now.
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.840]   Where, how are you even hearing that thing?
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.240]   And then it's like a confusing mindfulness question.
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.840]   They're like, I don't know.
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:02.240]   Right.
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.600]   But it's close.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.520]   And all of a sudden we assume because it's close and we've heard it a lot that it's
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.920]   true.
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.880]   But if you pay attention, this is probably one of the tools I help clients break free
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:17.040]   with is if you pay attention to its track record of predictions, it's really bad.
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.760]   It's really, it's all, you're going to fail at that meeting.
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.120]   No, one's going to buy the thing.
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.640]   And you go there and it goes okay.
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.120]   And people buy the thing that person would never go out with you.
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.640]   And then the person goes out with you, right?
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.480]   Maybe not that one, but the next one.
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.960]   And if you look at its track record, it's terrible.
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.960]   But then still the very next day, think about that.
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.320]   If you had like a financial advisor and they were just, they couldn't beat the
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.640]   market.
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.760]   They were wrong all the time and you just keep going back to them.
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.440]   And you're like, well, what do you think this time?
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.160]   And they're just so certain that you keep going to it.
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.080]   And I think that's how we are with the inner critic.
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.720]   So what do we do with both of these areas?
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.480]   And what are the tactics?
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.520]   Yeah, great question.
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.000]   So a lot of people, when they discover this, they're like, okay, how do I kill the
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.560]   critic, right?
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.240]   It's the enemy, slay the demon.
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.360]   And I don't think it works that way.
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.680]   You can think of like the parts of our psychology as that old show Survivor.
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:06.560]   I don't know if it's still running.
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.600]   You can't vote them off the island.
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.440]   You can't get rid of them, right?
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.440]   They actually are a part in there.
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.000]   The problem is not the survivor and the safety police.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.360]   The problem is the dial.
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.640]   The setting is too high.
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:23.120]   You do need some survival skills that prevents you from jumping off the 30 foot
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.760]   building and breaking your legs, right?
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.640]   It's like you have a sense of risk and all that.
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.120]   The issue is that we need to turn the dial down.
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.320]   And so the first thing that people have to do is they have to even know this
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.320]   conversation that we're having exists and say, wait a minute, it's not just me,
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.960]   Aziz or you, Chris, it's, there's a lot of diseases in there.
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.160]   There's a lot of parts inside.
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.920]   And one of the parts is this inner critic.
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.120]   So the first thing I do with people is can you, I, can you know when your critic
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.280]   is talking, can, do you know when it's you thinking versus the critic?
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.520]   Now we don't have to get crazy, you know, it's philosophical, like what is me,
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.240]   right?
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:02.240]   But, you know, are, are you seeing clearly, are you having a distorted view of
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.720]   yourself as incapable and unlovable?
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.880]   You'll, you'll start to hear the critic and get better at it because you'll know
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.320]   it's languages and extremes.
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.640]   It's going to go awful.
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.360]   Everyone's going to think you're terrible.
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.440]   It magnifies, it's just, just like a fun house distoral mirror.
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.200]   So you got to get one is identify the critic and just get good at it.
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.000]   So with clients, I'll have them do an awareness exercise usually for like a
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.560]   week or two where they're just noting it, tracking it.
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.080]   I'll have them name it too.
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.840]   And some people just call it the critic.
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:36.000]   Some people come up with these like pretty funny, creative, silly names, um,
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.080]   just to break the pattern a little bit.
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.400]   So you start to, to, to name it.
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:48.560]   Then the, the biggest technique you could call it tool is not some hack to just
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.200]   know what to say.
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.840]   It actually is deeper than that.
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.160]   You have to make what I call the decision of a lifetime.
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.840]   So I have a book called on my own side, which is guiding people through this.
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.680]   And so you're aware of this critic and they're like, yeah, yeah, it's do it.
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:02.240]   It's all the time.
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:02.880]   I can name it.
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:03.840]   I can see it now.
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:04.400]   Okay, great.
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:09.040]   Take a moment and really pay attention to what's happening here.
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.360]   Like really observe it for a while.
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.640]   Cause when you do, hopefully there's some part inside of you.
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:18.160]   It's like when you watch a movie or, I mean, maybe this has happened in your life.
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.760]   You're watching someone be almost in an abusive relationship.
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:26.400]   And you know, if you're watching a movie and, and what's that one with Leonardo
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:31.200]   DiCaprio and Robert De Niro from way back in the day, this boy's like some just terrible
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.240]   abusive stepfather.
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:36.160]   When you're watching that movie and you're identifying with the young character, every
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:43.120]   part of your body wants that young, you know, son or character to like, stand up to that
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:46.960]   tyrant and say like, this is effed up.
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:48.320]   Like I'm leaving your house.
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:49.520]   I'm out, I'm done.
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:54.480]   And basically people have to have that moment inside of themselves.
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:59.040]   Because what happens is like, okay, the critics beating them up and they're believing it.
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.240]   And they're like, okay, I caught it.
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.520]   Now what do I do?
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.840]   But the energy is not there.
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:06.560]   You need to have a revolution inside.
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:12.560]   You need to usurp the power of the critic and take control of your, of your inner self
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.320]   and be the captain of your ship as I call it.
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:18.720]   And that means like the critic is the parent kicking you around.
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.000]   You need to become the parent.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:20.960]   So it's a decision.
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:25.520]   The decision comes from like reaching a threshold moment of really observing, like, this is
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:26.080]   effed up.
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.000]   I can't like, what is this?
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.280]   What am I doing to myself?
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:34.720]   And you got to have this sense of almost outrage or disgust or revulsion or something.
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:35.600]   You say, all right, that's it.
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.200]   I'm going to take control here.
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.160]   Because otherwise, before that decision, it always goes like this.
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:41.840]   And I see this all the time.
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.360]   People go to cognitive therapy.
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.160]   They teach them how to deal with their negative thoughts, which is their critic.
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.920]   And they'll write out the critical thoughts.
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:49.520]   You're a loser or nobody likes you.
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.040]   And they're like, okay, what do I do?
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.120]   And the therapist is like, challenge the thought.
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.600]   And they're like, okay, I'm good.
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.200]   And many people do like me.
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.200]   Is that right?
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:04.320]   And it's, it's got no power because they're still, they're framed.
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:08.320]   They're still living within the reality created by their critic.
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.920]   They still see themselves that way.
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:14.880]   And so we have to shatter that and be willing to see what's really true.
