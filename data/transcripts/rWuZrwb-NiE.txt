[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   We are considering at the moment the words that are to be found in Paul's epistle to the Romans in chapter 8, verses 14 and 15.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   Verses 14 and 15 in the 8th chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but ye have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   Now we are reminding ourselves that here the apostle is giving all Christian people further ground for being assured and certain of their salvation.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   And the particular grounds he is dealing with here is this question of our sonship.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   And of course if we are in the relationship of sons, it is an indissoluble relationship.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   You can't go in and out of sonship.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   That is where every doctrine of falling away from grace is finally unscriptural and false.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   It is a matter of relationship.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   And God, we realize here, has adopted us into his family.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   Our position as Christians is not merely and only that we have been forgiven,
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   and then may sin ourselves out of forgiveness, and then come back again having been forgiven as the result of repentance.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   No, we are put into an entirely new relationship.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   We are adopted into the family of God.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   We become the sons or the children of God.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Very well, there is nothing more important for every one of us, therefore, than to know for certain that we are the sons of God.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   How can we be sure?
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Now the apostle in this little paragraph is giving us the answer to that question.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   The first answer is this. If we are being led by the Spirit of God, then we can be sure that we are the sons of God.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   The man who is not a Christian is not led by the Spirit of God.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   He resists the Spirit. He is opposed to the Spirit.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   He doesn't receive the revelation of the Spirit.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   He is devoid of the Spirit. He is dead in trespasses and sins.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   So if we can prove that we are being led by the Spirit of God, we can be certain that we are sons.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   And we spent most of our time last Friday night in considering the tests which we applied to ourselves
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   in order to make sure that we are being led by the Spirit of God.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   And they were very practical tests.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   They were tests of conduct and behaviour, tests of desire, and so on.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   But I did say this, that there are those who would interpret this being led by the Spirit of God
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   as referring to the whole question of guidance, guidance in our lives.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   We all need guidance. What are we to do? What are we to do with our lives?
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Am I to go this way or that way? Guidance.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   And they say that this is a reference to the fact that those who are Christians
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   are guided in their decisions and in the totality of their life, as it were, by the leading of the Spirit.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Now, I think I hurriedly mentioned my view on this particular subject. I would put it like this.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   I do not think that that is the main thrust of this statement.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Indeed, I would almost be prepared to go so far as to say that that really is not referred to at all here,
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   but that what the Apostle means is what we were dealing with last Friday.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   However, I hesitate to go quite as far as to say that it does not come in at all.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   But it certainly is not the main thing, and for this very good reason,
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   that it is much too subjective a test.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   It is the simplest thing in the world to persuade yourself that you are being led of the Spirit.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Some of the greatest tragedies in the history of the Church have resulted from fanatical persons
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   who were quite certain that they were being led by the Holy Spirit to do this, that, or the other.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Oftentimes, the things concerned were diametrically opposed to the plain teaching of the Scripture.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   But they felt that they were being led and guided by the Spirit.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   It is a subjective test, and therefore I cannot imagine that the Apostle would have that in his mind
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   when he is concerned here to be not only practical, but to give us tests which we can apply to ourselves,
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   which rarely are satisfactory to us, and are not subject to the criticism of exposing us to the vagaries of a kind of subjectivism.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   However, I say we cannot go so far as to say that it is altogether and entirely excluded.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   And my reason for that is that there are notable examples and illustrations given in the book of the Acts of the Apostles,
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   where the Holy Spirit did lead and guide the Christian Church in a very explicit and clear manner.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   Now, let me just give you the headings that you can read it for yourselves.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   The first is in the book of Acts of the Apostles, chapter 13, verse 2, where we read,
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   "As they ministered to the Lord and fasted, the Holy Ghost said,
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   'Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.'
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   How did the Holy Ghost tell them that? Well, we do not know.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   He may have impressed it upon the mind of a number of these people together,
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   so that they all felt an urge and a leading to say this to Barnabas and Saul."
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   He does that. The Holy Spirit can impress a thing upon the mind.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   He can keep a thing before us constantly, so that we cannot escape it.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   We are conscious of a kind of pressure upon the mind and upon the spirit.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   We feel an urge urging us in a given direction.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   That may be the leading of the Holy Spirit.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   He certainly does that sometimes, as he did it on this occasion in Acts 13, 2.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   Then there is another illustration of the same thing in Acts 15, 28, where I read this.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   Here is the council, you remember, at Jerusalem.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   And here is the message which is sent by the church,
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   the council at Jerusalem to the Christian churches.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   "For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things."
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   It seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   The Holy Ghost had again made clear what his leading, his guidance was in this matter.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   They had been reasoning it out themselves, and they say what we had reasoned out
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   corresponded with, agreed with, tallied with what the Holy Ghost himself was indicating to us.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   But perhaps the most striking examples which we can ever find are to be found in the next chapter,
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   the 16th chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles, in verses 6 and 7.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   "Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia,
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia,
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   after they were come to Messiah, they are said to go into Bithynia.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   But the Spirit," and as the Authorized Version puts it bluntly,
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   "the Spirit of Jesus suffered them not."
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   Now there are two striking statements.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   They were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   The Spirit of Jesus suffered them not when they attempted to go into Bithynia.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   Now there are two very important statements.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   Again, we are not told how the Holy Spirit did this,
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   but what is made plain and clear is that he did prohibit them.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   And of course, he can do that.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   Haven't we all known something about this in personal experience?
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   When you may, with your reason and understanding,
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   having examined the pros and cons of a certain proposal,
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   you may have arrived at your decision.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   Let's say as an example that you've decided to do something.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   Then you begin to feel something that you cannot explain,
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   but you're very conscious of.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   You begin to feel a pressure in your spirit,
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   as it were, prohibiting you to do this very thing
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   that you've decided to do with your mind and with your reason.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   Now that, I believe, is very often, if not always,
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   the pressure of the Holy Spirit.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   I'm talking, of course, about Christian people
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   who have honestly told God their one desire is to do his will.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   And they've rightly used their mind, their understanding,
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   they may have consulted others, and there is the decision.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   But in spite of that, there seems to be some pressure on the spirit.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   There seems to be a rigid opposition.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   A door seems to be closed in the spirit,
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   and you feel you can't proceed.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   I take it that it was something like that
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   that was experienced on these occasions that I refer to there
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   in the 16th chapter of the book of the Acts in verses 6 and 7.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   Well, then, there is no question that the Holy Spirit does guide.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   But I say once more that I am quite convinced
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   that that is not the thing, obviously,
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   that was uppermost in the mind of the apostle,
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   because in verse 13 he had been dealing with this whole question of sanctification,
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   where he said, "But if ye through the spirit
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   "do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live."
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   And then he immediately goes on to say,
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   "For as many as are led by the Spirit of God,"
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   well, how does he lead?
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   Well, that's one of the ways in the mortification of the deeds of the body.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   And we simply expended that text last Friday evening.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   Very well, we leave verse 14 then at that.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   And we come now in verse 15 to the second test
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   that we apply to ourselves in order to make sure
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   that we are indeed the sons of the children of God.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   I would remind you once more that nothing is of such practical importance as just this.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   To be assured of salvation is the highest privilege
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   of the Christian believer in this world of time.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   Now, here it is given us by the apostle in this most interesting and most important verse.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   I sometimes feel that it is true to say that a man's spirituality
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   can be tested perhaps more thoroughly by this verse and the verse that follows
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   than by almost any other statement in the whole of the Scripture.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   And it is particularly interesting and fascinating
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   to test commentators by their view of these two verses.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   The men who are mainly intellectual, it seems to me,
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   have not even begun to understand these two verses.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   They miss the point completely.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   The more spiritually minded a commentator,
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   the more he will find riches in this statement in this verse
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   and in the verse that follows.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   Now, this is the most important verse from the standpoint, I say,
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   of this assurance of salvation.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   It gives me something over and above what I've obtained from verse 14.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   That was wonderful. That was enough.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   But you see the riches of God's grace.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   God's our Father if we are Christians.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   And He doesn't want anybody to be in any doubt at all.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   He will multiply the proofs.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   So here He's giving us something on top of the other.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   And therefore it is a most valuable verse
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   from that standpoint of peace of mind and of heart
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   and assurance of salvation.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   But as I hope to be able to show you,
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   this verse has another most important aspect.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   And that is, to me, it casts very great light upon chapter 7,
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   which we've already done, verses 7 to 25.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   And I hope to be able to show you that this verse
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   is one of the means of justifying the exposition that we gave
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   of those interesting and most controversial verses
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   that are to be found there in that seventh chapter.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   Very well, then. Let's have a look at it.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   The first question that engages our attention immediately
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   is the use of this word "spirit" twice over.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   "For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear,
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   but ye have received the spirit of adoption,
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   whereby we cry, 'Abba, Father!'"
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   Now then, here is the same word used twice.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   You see, there's a comparison and a contrast here.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   There are two sides to this matter.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   But the same word is used, "spirit, spirit."
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   What's it mean?
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   There are those who say that it means just this,
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   a disposition, a feeling.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   And that it means that in both instances,
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   that the apostle is saying, "Now, you as Christian people,
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   we as Christian people have not received a kind of heavy spirit
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   of bondage and of fear and of discouragement and of lassitude.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   No, we haven't received that.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   Well, what have we received?
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   Well, we've received a happy spirit, a joyful spirit."
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   In other words, they say that on both sides,
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   the word "spirit" here stands for disposition or feeling.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   And that therefore he is saying that when we were not Christians,
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   we had that spirit of bondage and of fear.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   But now that we've become Christians,
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   we have got this spirit of adoption,
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   whereby we cry, "Abba, Father!"
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   Well, it's perfectly true to say that we do use the word "spirit" like that, don't we?
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   We read in the Bible of a man having a spirit of meekness.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   There is such a thing as a spirit of disobedience.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   And we do talk about a man being in good spirits or bad spirits.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   And the argument is that that is how the apostle was using the word "hell."
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   Now, there are those in the second place who say that it isn't that.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   And obviously the translators of this authorized version that is in front of me didn't take that view.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   Because I find that the first use of the word "spirit" here,
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   "spirit" is spelt with a small "s."
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   Whereas in the second use, it is used with a capital "S."
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   You have not received the spirit of bondage and of fear, small "s."
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   No, you have received the spirit, capital "S," of adoption,
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   whereby we cry, "Abba, Father."
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   And they say, therefore, that it means this.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   In the first instance, it does mean disposition or feeling.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   In the second case, it doesn't mean that.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   It means the Holy Spirit.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   So you put your capital "S."
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   Now, why do they say this?
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   Well, their argument is this.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   That it is the Holy Spirit himself who produces our adoption.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   And therefore, when he talks about the spirit of adoption,
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   he means the spirit that produces the adoption or creates the adoption within us.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   Well, that may or may not be true.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   I would prefer to say myself that it is the Father rather than the Spirit who does the adopting.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   The Spirit comes in, of course.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   But I would have said it was primarily the work of the Father.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   But there is another reason, which seems to me to be much more cogent,
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   or more itinerant regarding this second use of spirit as referring to the Holy Spirit.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   And that is what we found in the reading at the beginning in Galatians 4, 6, where we read this.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   "And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, 'Abba, Father.'"
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   Now, that's obviously a parallel with this statement here in Romans 8, 15.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   And explicitly, we are told there in Galatians 4, 6, that it is the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of God's Son,
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   who is sent into our heart and thereby leads us to cry out, "Abba, Father."
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   Now, that, I would argue, is really quite conclusive in and of itself.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   So, there is that second view which says that, no, you mustn't say that the two uses of the word spirit here
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   are simply referring to disposition of healing.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   It is quite clear that at any rate, in the second, it is the Holy Spirit himself.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   And you rightly, therefore, put your capital S.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   But can we stop at that?
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   Well, I want to suggest that we cannot stop at that.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   And that we must regard it as the Holy Spirit in both instances, not only in the second, but also in the first.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   Now, then, you can't do that, says this second school, you can't do that for this reason.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   You cannot describe the Holy Spirit as a spirit of bondage.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   They say that's impossible.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   Doesn't 2 Corinthians 3, 17 tell us, they say, that where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty?
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   So, if it is true to say that where the Spirit is Lord, there is liberty,
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   you can't say that the Spirit is a spirit of bondage.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   And surely, they say, you must never say that the Holy Spirit of God could produce a sense of bondage.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   So, they sum it up like this by saying, no, no, what the apostle is saying is this.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   The Spirit that God has given you is not a spirit that produces bondage,
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   but is a spirit that produces adoption, whereby we cry, "Abba, Father."
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   And so, they argue that the contrast here is the contrast between the unbeliever on the one hand and the believer on the other.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   That it's the contrast between the pre-conversion and the conversion state.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   Well, now, then, how do I deal with that objection?
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   And I answer it along the following lines.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   First and foremost, the whole context here is that of the Holy Spirit himself.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   That's most important, it seems to me.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   The apostle has been dealing with the Spirit almost from the commencement of the entire chapter.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   But certainly, in the immediate context, he is dealing all along with the Spirit.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   "For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die; but if ye through the Spirit" - capital S - "do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   For ye have not received the Spirit of bondage."
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   The whole context is the Holy Spirit.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   "The Spirit itself" - in verse 16 - "beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God."
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   Now, the whole time he's dealing with the Holy Spirit, and when he does deal with our spirit, he says so, explicitly in verse 16.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   There's my first answer.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   A second answer is this.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   It is surely most unlikely that the apostle should change the meaning of the same word
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   without giving us some indication that he's doing so.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   He could have done so quite easily.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   He is putting before us this contrast.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   And if the contrast is to be perfect, if you are to preserve the balance of the two statements,
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   well then, surely, this crucial word "spirit" must carry the same meaning on the one side as it does on the other.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   We should always be very careful and hesitant about changing the meaning of a word like this
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   without having some very good reason for doing so.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   My third answer is this.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   That it is to me entirely wrong to say that the unconverted have a spirit of bondage and of fear.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   That is something I say which is quite unscriptural.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   The unconverted do not suffer from a spirit of bondage and of fear.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   Indeed, the whole trouble with them is that they haven't got that.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   The trouble with the unbeliever is that he is dead in trespasses and in sins.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   He feels quite secure.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   He's not a bit troubled about himself and about his eternal future.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   Why, the apostle has already told us that about himself in chapter 7 and in verse 9, where he puts it like this.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   "For I was alive without the law once."
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   He was all right.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   He tells us exactly the same thing, of course, in that fascinating bit of autobiography
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   in the third chapter of the epistle to the Philippians.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   Perfectly satisfied. Everything was all right.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   "I was alive without the law once."
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   Here he was, a Hebrew of the Hebrews of the tribe of Benjamin, keeping the law as regards its demands.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   Perfect. Nothing more to be desired.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   That's not the spirit of bondage. That's not the spirit of fear.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   That's the spirit of security, self-satisfaction, a man who's perfectly happy about himself.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   I say, therefore, that it is impossible that the first part of this fifteenth verse
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   should be a reference to the unconverted person as he is dead in trespasses and sins,
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   utterly lifeless, not touched at all by the operations of the Holy Spirit.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   And that leads me to my fourth answer,
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   which is that I want to emphasize the words "received" and especially the word "again."
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   "For ye have not received again, but ye have received."
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   Now, in both instances, you see, on both sides of the statement, you've got this word "received,"
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   which suggests that he is saying that the person to whom he's referring
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   had at one time received the spirit of bondage,
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   even as he has also received the spirit of adoption.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   He wasn't always like that. No, no. He has received a spirit of bondage to fear,
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   and he has received the spirit of adoption.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   You lose your parallel if you don't say that.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   And this becomes much more important when you bring in the word "again."
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   "For you have not received again the spirit of bondage to fear."
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   You did receive the spirit of bondage to fear, but you haven't received that again.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   That's what he's saying.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   So take the two words together, the "receiving" and the "again."
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   And I think it helps to develop the argument and to bring us to this position.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   That the apostle is saying here that a Christian
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   is a man who once received this spirit of bondage to fear.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   How did he receive that?
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   Well, he received that, of course, as the result of the operation of the Holy Spirit upon him.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   In other words, my argument is that it is the Holy Spirit
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   that does produce the spirit of bondage to fear,
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   and that he alone can do that.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   And he does it, of course, by means of or through the law of God.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   Now then, let me try to establish and to demonstrate what I'm saying.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   The best exposition that I know, therefore, of the first half of this verse
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   is the seventh chapter of this same epistle to the Romans, verses 7 to 25.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   What do we get there? Well, you remember it, don't you?
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   This is what we get there.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   The apostle says, "I was alive once without the law,
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   but when the commandment came, sin revived and I died."
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   You remember what it was, don't you?
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   He thought he understood the law, but he didn't.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   Then the Holy Spirit really brought the law to him.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   He really was made to see the spirituality of the law.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   He tells us that, you see, that this commandment itself,
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   as he tells us, is holy and just and good.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   This is something spiritual.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   We know that the law is spiritual.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   Yes, but he didn't know that until the Holy Spirit brought him to see that.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   When he was alive without the law, he didn't understand this.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   No, what happened was that the Holy Spirit came
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   and applied the law to him for the first time,
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   and he was deeply convicted.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   And what was the result?
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   Well, you remember the result, don't you?
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   The terrible bondage in which he found himself,
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   which makes him say, "We know that the law is spiritual,
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   but I am carnal, sold under sin.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   For that which I do, I allow not.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   For what I would that do I not, but what I hate that do I."
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   And so on and so forth.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   The rest of the seventh chapter of this epistle to the Romans.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   It is the Holy Spirit who does that.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   Now this is the most important point.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   The law itself doesn't do it and cannot do it.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   Here were these Jews, you see, they were confronted with the law,
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   and they had a mechanical intellectual knowledge of the law,
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   but they'd never come under its power.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   It hadn't convicted them truly.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   It is the Holy Spirit alone who can do that.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   There is no other power that can give the spirit of bondage and of fear
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   except the Holy Spirit.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   But that is exactly what he does.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   Now not only can the law not do it,
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   it is equally true to say that circumstances can't do it.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   Circumstances can frighten us.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   They can alarm us.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   They can make people stop sinning for a while
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   and try to live a good life for a while,
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   but that's not a spirit of bondage to fear,
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   which means a real conviction of sin as I'll show you.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   Now I say even circumstances can't do that.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   Let me take the notable example that is found in the 16th chapter
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   of the book of the Acts of the Apostles, the Philippian jailer.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   Now there was a man, you remember, the earthquake took place,
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   and the man comes trembling and saying,
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   What made him say that?
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   "Ah," you say, "the earthquake."
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   No, no.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   That man had been in earthquakes before.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   Men can pass through earthquakes without ever being compelled to say,
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   It wasn't the earthquake that convicted that man.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   It was the Holy Spirit.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   The Holy Spirit may have used the earthquake partly,
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   but the earthquake alone couldn't do it.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   Men can go through wars and not be any better about a conviction of sin.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   The last two wars, what did they do in this matter?
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   Did they lead to revival?
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   Did they lead to repentance?
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   Of course they didn't.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   Calamities don't do that.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   It is only the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit,
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   that can lead to the spirit of bondage to fear.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   And, of course, you get that constantly in the New Testament.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   Take the great example, for instance,
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   in the second chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   Here is the apostle Peter preaching on the day of Pentecost.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   "Then suddenly we are told they were pricked in their hearts,
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   and they began to cry out, saying,
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   'Men and brethren, what shall we do?'"
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   Why did they cry out like that?
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   There is only one answer.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   It was because they were in a spirit of bondage and of fear.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   What had produced it?
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   Oh, it was the Holy Ghost that had been poured out upon Peter and the other apostles,
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   which was using Peter as he was preaching and expounding the Scriptures.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   Here were men who were perfectly happy and quite well,
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   knowing nothing about bondage nor fear when Peter began to preach.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   But as he went on and applied his message,
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   this tremendous power of conviction through the Spirit came upon these men.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   And in a spirit of bondage and of fear they cried out, saying,
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   "Men and brethren, what shall we do?"
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   That's it. It was the result of the work of the Spirit.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   And, of course, this is something that you will find often
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   as you read the biographies of the saints.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   They will tell you how they passed through a terrible period of bondage and of fear.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   John Bunyan will tell you in his grace abounding that he was in this condition for 18 months.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   So much so, he tells us, that on certain occasions he wished that he were not alive.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   He wished that he were an animal.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   He one day saw some geese grazing in a field.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   He wished he belonged to them and that he was a goose.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   Another occasion he tells us it was so terrible that he could have sworn
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   he could smell brimstone in the air.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   What's that? That's a spirit of bondage, a spirit of fear.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   But, you see, that was the work of the Holy Spirit in convicting John Bunyan
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   prior to that he'd been very free and very careless and apparently happy.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   But, of course, if you want to see this on a big scale,
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   you've simply got to read the history, the story of any one of the great revivals of religion.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   Isn't this the thing that happens?
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   When the Spirit of God comes down in revival,
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   his first effect invariably is to do this very thing,
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   is to humble people, is to convict them profoundly of sin,
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   is to make them feel utterly and completely hopeless,
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   which they'd never felt before, and that nothing can be done for them.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   A great spirit of conviction.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   They groan literally, physically.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   They're often in agony and in torment.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   A spirit of bondage and a spirit of fear.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   Yes, but it is the result of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   How ridiculous it is, therefore, to say that the Holy Spirit could never do this.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   But, you know, the Holy Spirit is the Spirit that convicts of sin and of righteousness and of judgment.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   It is the Holy Spirit that brings a man down and shows him his need.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   And that is the way he brings him into a spirit of bondage and of fear.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   You see how foolish it is to take just one text out of its context
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   and to say, "Oh, but he says where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty."
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   That's the end of the process, but it isn't the beginning.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   And the Spirit that gives the liberty first and foremost gives the bondage and the fear.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   So my argument is that the apostle here is using the term "spirit"
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   at the beginning and at the end in the same sense.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   And in both instances, it is the Holy Spirit himself.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   Now then, a further argument, if you like to clinch all this, would be this.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   That it is only as we interpret this verse in this way,
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   that we bring it into line with and show that it is parallel to
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   the almost identical argument which the apostle uses there
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   in the fourth chapter of the epistle to the Galatians once more.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   Where, you see, he is drawing a contrast.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   Again, "I say that the heir, as long as he is a child"
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   - now he is an heir, remember - "as long as he is a child,
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all,
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father."
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   Even so, we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   "But when the fullness of the time was come,
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   And because he a son, God hath sent forth the spirit of his Son into our hearts,
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   crying, 'Abba, Father!'"
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   I maintain that that is just an elaboration of the two halves
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   of this one fifteenth verse in the eighth chapter of the epistle to the Romans.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   And furthermore, I would argue that it is exactly the same thing
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   at the end of that fourth chapter of the epistle to the Galatians,
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   from verse 21 to verse 31.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   Where again, he has got this same contrast
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   we put in terms of the child of the bondwoman
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   and the child of the free woman.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   So that, you see, it not only suits its own immediate context,
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   but it brings it into line with the similar, analogous statements
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   which are made by the apostle elsewhere,
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   where he is concerned with the same matter.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   And I am very happy to be able to add, as a final bit of evidence
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   and of encouragement to you to accept this exposition,
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   that I am saying nothing original.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   It has become inevitable to me as the result of my exposition of chapter 7,
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   and I believe I quoted this verse as I was expounding chapter 7.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   I have been very happy since then to discover
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   that one of the greatest of the early Puritans, a man called John Preston,
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   John Preston, who was chaplain to King James I and King Charles I for a while,
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   but a great Puritan, revered by the later great Puritans,
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   such as John Owen and Thomas Goodwin and others,
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   he expounds this in precisely this manner.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   I shall give you some quotations from him in a moment.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   And the same is true of another of these great Puritans, Thomas Horton.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   And the same applies, of course, to Thomas Goodwin himself.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   Well, now then, what then is our doctrine?
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   Well, the doctrine is this.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   This spirit of bondage and of fear
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   is the peculiar work of the Holy Spirit himself.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   The law cannot do this.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   It's one of the things the law cannot do.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   That is why the law had not solved the problem.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   The law was incapable of doing this.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   But it is the Spirit's special work.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   Now, he generally does it, as I've been emphasizing, through the law.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   You need the Spirit on top of the law.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   It was necessary in the case of Paul himself,
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   as it is in the case of everybody else.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   It is the peculiar work of the Holy Spirit himself.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   He comes, then, I say to us, as we are careless and indifferent
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   and feeling quite secure as we are,
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   with never a thought about the soul
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   and about the judgment of God and our eternal punishment.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   The Spirit comes and applies the law to us.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   And as he does so, he produces this spirit of bondage and of fear.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   What, then, are its manifestations?
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   Well, here they are.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   The first thing, of course, is a sense of condemnation.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   You see, that's what happened to the apostle.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   Go back to chapter 7, verse 10 again.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   "And the commandment which was ordained to life I found to be unto death."
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   And in the next verse, "For sin, taking the occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me."
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   "Was then that which is good made death unto me?"
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   It all along led to a sense of condemnation.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   And that is the first evidence, always, of this spirit of bondage and of fear.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   A man is awakened to the fact that he is a sinner,
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   that he is in an utterly wrong relationship to God,
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   that he is condemned by the law of God,
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   that he is under the wrath of God,
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   that his whole eternal destiny is to be one of torment
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   if he should remain like that and die like that.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   That's the first thing that happens.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   Condemnation accompanied by fear.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   But not only that, he at the same time is given a sense of his inward depravity.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   Now, you remember again how in chapter 7 the apostle keeps on playing on this.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   Here it is again in verse 14,
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   "We know that the law is spiritual, but I am carnal, sold under sin."
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   Now, the natural man never feels that. He doesn't know that.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   It is only a man who is under conviction of sin by the Holy Spirit
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   as he applies the law, who comes to realize that his very nature is carnal.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   That he is sold under sin.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   He says it again in the 17th verse of that 7th chapter.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   "Now it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me."
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   Verse 18, "I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing."
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   Verse 20, "If I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me."
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   "I find then a law that when I would do good, evil is present with me."
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   Verse 23, "I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind."
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   And so on.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   You see, he is aware of his inward depravity.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   He had never realized that before.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   He realizes now, not only that he does things which are wrong and sinful,
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   but that there is something much worse than that.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   Why does he ever desire to do them?
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   What is it that ever leads him to do them?
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   And he is given to see that it is this nature of his that is so utterly depraved, carnal,
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   sold under sin, "In me that is to say in my flesh dwelleth no good thing at all."
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   He is a mass of corruption.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   Now, it is the spirit alone that can bring a man to see that.
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   And when a man sees it, he is conscious of a terrible bondage and a terrible fear.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   But that goes on to the next thing,
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   which is of course that he realizes his utter inability to rid himself of this.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   There again, of course, is the great theme of that seventh chapter.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   Listen to it again in verse 15,
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   "That which I do I allow not, for what I would that do I not, but what I hate that do I."
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   Verse 18, "I know that in me for to will is present with me, but how to perform that which is good I know not.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   I am in bonds, I can't, I like this law, I love it, but I can't, I am helpless."
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   That is what he is saying in verses 18 and 19.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   And he says it again in verse 21,
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   "I find a law that when I would do good, evil is present with me."
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   And again verse 23,
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   "I see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind,
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   I am bound, I am helpless, I am incapable, I am unable.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   I see the nature of the law now and its spirituality.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   I'd like to keep it, I can't keep it.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   I am bound, I am fettered, I am tired.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   I am in captivity, I am a serf.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   It is only the spirit that brings a man to see that."
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   And so finally it leads to a sense of complete hopelessness and indeed of despair.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   It makes him say, "Oh, wretched man that I am!
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   I can't, I've tried, I've failed.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   This thing that's in me is too strong for me.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   I'm hopeless.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   Oh, wretched man that I am!
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?"
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   Those are the manifestations of the spirit of bondage and the spirit of fear.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   And they are manifestations that are produced only by the Holy Spirit of God.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   Now my time has gone unfortunately, so I'd better not start on my next proposal, proposition, which is this.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   I give it to you to think of during the coming week.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   The spirit of bondage, which I've just been describing, always precedes the spirit of adoption.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   You see, the Apostle is building up his case.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   There are grounds for assurance in the first half of this fifteenth verse as well as in the second.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   However, I'll have to leave that tonight and God willing we will return to it
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   next Friday evening.
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   But hold on to the manifestations of the spirit of bondage.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   And especially perhaps tonight let us realize this,
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   that the man of Romans 7 is, as we said at the time,
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   not your full grown, full fledged, full blown Christian at the height of his Christian experience.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   No, no.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   He is a man who is only in a state of conviction under the law.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   He is not the completely unregenerate.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   He is not the regenerate.
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   He is a man in this preliminary stage of under conviction.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   He has been awakened to the true nature of the law
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   and he realizes that he is not only in a state of bondage,
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   he is in a state of terrible danger.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   He is under condemnation.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   He cannot deliver himself from the guilt of sin nor from the power of sin.
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   He'd give anything if he could, but he can't.
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   He is in a condition, a state of a spirit of bondage and a spirit of fear.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   We receive the spirit of bondage and of fear.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   And when we receive it, that is how it shows itself.
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   Well, we leave it at that for this evening
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   and God willing we'll continue with it next Friday night.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   Let us pray.
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   O Lord, our God, we come into thy presence once more
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   with grateful and with thankful hearts.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   We thank thee for thy word.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   Lord, we thank thee that thy word speaks to us
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   and speaks to us in its every part and portion.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   We thank thee for the very negatives.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   We thank thee for the proofs we find even in the negatives.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   O God, we know not how to thank thee sufficiently
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   for thy blessed Holy Spirit.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   For we have all known something of that false security,
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   that deadness in trespasses and sins to spiritual realities.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   And therefore, O Lord, we would thank thee that looking back tonight
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   we know something of the spirit of bondage and the spirit of fear.
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   O Lord, receive our praise.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   And as we leave ourselves in thy loving and mighty hands,
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   we pray thee to continue thy gracious dealings with us.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   O Lord, we thank thee for the sense of safety and security
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   which come from the knowledge of being in thy hands
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   and of knowing that thou art working in us and upon us.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   And now, may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   and the fellowship and the communion of the Holy Spirit
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   abide and continue with us now this night,
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   throughout the remainder of this our short and certain earthly life and pilgrimage,
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   and evermore. Amen.
