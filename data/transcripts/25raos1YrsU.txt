[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.120]   - Would you count pain-inducing bodybuilding workouts
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.000]   as high quality leisure?
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.480]   Greetings from Santa Cruz, Bolivia.
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.500]   - Second question, bodybuilding
[00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.120]   as a high quality leisure activity.
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.480]   Jesse, I'm gonna throw this to you.
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.560]   You know a lot about that culture,
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.120]   maybe not bodybuilding, but exercise, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.280]   That's a really intense, complicated
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.720]   high quality leisure activity, right?
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.120]   - 100%, yeah.
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.560]   I mean, even looking at,
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.440]   I was a big fan of Arnold's biography
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.000]   and some of the stuff that he's put out.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.200]   And he said, you know, when he was training,
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.100]   like when he was in his 20s and stuff,
[00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.940]   like going in there was like doing deep work
[00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.000]   for five hours out of the day.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.820]   He broke it up in the morning and the afternoon,
[00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.060]   but I would think 100% that would count.
[00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.280]   - Yeah, no, that sounds good to me.
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.280]   I just watched that biography on,
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.720]   I think it was on Netflix, of Ronnie Coleman,
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.520]   who was the six or seven time Mr. Universe,
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.320]   a huge guy, now his whole body's broken down.
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.120]   He can't walk and he's in constant pain
[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.840]   because he's lifting such heavy weights.
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.220]   But that looked pretty deep to me.
[00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.520]   Like that looked pretty deep to me.
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.160]   So yeah, Pablo, I think that's great.
[00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.280]   Also, I like that it's different.
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.440]   So you're using different parts of your brain
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.840]   than like your normal work or your other types of life.
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.240]   And I think there's probably a clarity that comes to that.
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.000]   I mean, look, when people see me,
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.220]   they're like, this is a guy who knows about bodybuilding.
[00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.820]   So they're often coming to me for advice.
[00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.520]   When you look at me, you think super athlete,
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.640]   you think steroids, you think that's a guy
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.220]   who knows his way around the gym.
[00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.860]   So I'm not surprised you asked me this question,
[00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.320]   but yeah, that's deep, go for it.
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.040]   - Actually, I'm gonna ask you another question
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.500]   to his part two.
[00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.080]   So in a lot of these bodybuilders,
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.840]   a lot of people who lift and whatnot,
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.600]   what's your view on them having earphones in
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.200]   and listening and stuff while they're lifting?
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.560]   'Cause a lot of, like Arnold talks about like really
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.760]   thinking about the muscle and like feeling it
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.080]   and feeling it grow and stuff,
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.320]   but you could be distracted
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.560]   if you have other things in your ear.
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.400]   So I was just wondering to know your thoughts on that.
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.640]   - You know, I've read about that somewhere.
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.720]   I mean, you might know more about it,
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.560]   but it seems to be true that,
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.040]   because of the mind muscle connection,
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.400]   that really concentrating on the muscle
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.000]   that you're trying to exhaust or contract
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.400]   to do the reps on makes a difference.
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.280]   So, I mean, is this the case,
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.360]   you would know this, Jesse, more than me.
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.140]   Is this the case for serious weightlifters
[00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.120]   that the concentration on the muscle aspect
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.980]   of what they do is key?
[00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.360]   - I think so, 100%.
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.440]   Arnold totally believes in that.
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.920]   And that's was, I think, a big,
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.720]   'cause he was so disciplined, he could focus on that.
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.860]   And I think that helped him when he was training.
[00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.200]   And I said it in my personal life
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.960]   by just not wearing headphones anymore.
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.040]   I mean, sometimes you're at the gym,
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.120]   there might be music on and whatnot.
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.120]   You can't really help that.
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.360]   But I don't know, I've kind of always thought
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.520]   about what your thoughts on that were.
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.400]   - I suspect, I'm just thinking about this out loud,
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.400]   but I suspect doing that type of training,
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.440]   so you're doing muscle training,
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.740]   but you're giving full concentration to the contraction
[00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.040]   because it helps, is probably fantastic,
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.800]   general, deep work calisthenics.
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.600]   Like, in other words, if you're doing that
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.380]   on a regular basis as part of a fitness routine,
[00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.900]   you're gonna be able to concentrate on a book better.
[00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.780]   You're gonna be able to concentrate when you're walking
[00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.080]   and trying to hold a thought in your head better.
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.720]   So it's a good point, Jesse,
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.400]   because I think Pablo, actually,
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.620]   I'm gonna go beyond now and say,
[00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.280]   not only does that count as high quality leisure,
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.880]   doing serious weight training might actually be
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.880]   a fantastic way of improving your general ability
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.640]   to concentrate.
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.480]   And you have all the other advantages
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.360]   that's different than the other type of thinking you do
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.080]   so that you get that relaxation and anxiety reduction.
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.840]   Look, I'm picking up my fitness this January as well.
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.000]   I don't like the dark, I don't like the dark weather.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.720]   And so I'll see if that has a difference,
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.440]   but it's a good point.
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.080]   Yeah, yeah, I think that's a good tool
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.040]   in the deep work toolkit.
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.620]   (upbeat music)
[00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.200]   (upbeat music)
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.420]   (upbeat music)
