[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200]   We have for Love in London, we sell a three-day itinerary, that's our most popular thing.
[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.220]   And we also have a six-day one, which has actually been really popular as well because
[00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.240]   most of my audience are people who are coming from the US, so they are coming for usually
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.360]   more than three days.
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.000]   But a week is a great amount of time.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.240]   And I usually say, if you want to do day trips, I usually recommend not doing them if you
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.840]   have less than a week because there's just so much you can do in London.
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.440]   And again, if you're still feeling a bit jet lagged and you've come to London, you've been
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.320]   running, running, running for the first few days, and then you have to hop on a train
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.800]   one day and head out to Bath or Oxford or wherever you want to go, that's great.
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.280]   But also you might want to just slow it down a little bit, in my opinion.
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.200]   I'm always trying to get people to just be like, "Okay, there's a lot to do and you can't
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.200]   do it all.
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.240]   So let's try to slow down and leave some room for if you see a shop that you want to go
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.520]   into and spend an hour in, or you run past a cafe and you're like, "Let's just sit for
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.560]   an hour and have a nice coffee and just relax," then you can do that.
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.280]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading your life,
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.280]   money and travel.
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.200]   If you're new here, I'm your host, Chris Hutchins, and one of the areas I love optimizing the
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.200]   most is travel.
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.840]   I've been to 60 plus countries and on every trip, I love meeting locals, trying to understand
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.480]   their culture, having authentic experiences.
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.280]   And most of all, I love finding a way to eat all the best foods a place has to offer.
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.920]   So I thought it'd be fun to introduce a new type of episode where I bring in a local expert
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.760]   in another country to share all the hacks for visiting their city.
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.080]   I was originally going to start with Japan because it just opened, I have the perfect
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.780]   person in mind, and it's probably my favorite travel destination in the world.
[00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.720]   But that episode will be next because after my episode with Bill Perkins, which is amazing
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.560]   if you haven't checked it out, I started talking with Amy about how we could start optimizing
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.800]   for more net fulfillment in our lives.
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.560]   And so we actually decided to book a last minute trip to London on less than two weeks
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.520]   notice and ended up getting a ridiculous deal with points, which I will talk about at the
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.840]   end of this episode.
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.240]   So with a trip to London on the horizon, I reached out to Jessica Dante, who not only
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.480]   has been living there for almost a decade, but runs the Love in London YouTube channel,
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.480]   which has over 20 million views, and she knows so much about London.
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:14.160]   We're going to get into why you should visit, what you should do, what mistakes to avoid,
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.820]   and get all of Jess' secret spots to visit to have an incredible trip.
[00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:24.240]   So let's get into it right after this.
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:30.800]   Jess, thank you for joining the first travel destination episode of All The Hacks.
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.800]   Amazing.
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.000]   Thanks for having me.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.720]   Really happy that London is the first.
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:35.720]   I'm not going to lie.
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.520]   I think I'm a little biased, but I think it's maybe the best in my opinion, but you know.
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.080]   Well, it's not just you.
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.400]   So someone shared me this list from afar, the website and magazine afar, there was the
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.840]   10 best cities and London was number one.
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.560]   And there was another study that residents did on the best cities and in London was number
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.560]   one.
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.560]   It just came out also for 2023.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.600]   And then I looked at travel and leisure's best destinations for 2023 and London's on
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.600]   that list.
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.600]   So I was like, "Wow.
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.560]   So London's the number one city."
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.320]   It wasn't even just to live or to travel.
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.920]   It was just the number one city on two lists.
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.700]   So I think I want to ask you, why do you love London?
[00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.120]   What is it about London that makes it such an amazing city?
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.120]   Oh my gosh.
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.600]   Well, there's so many things, but I think a couple of the top things are, I love how
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.660]   diverse that the city is.
[00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:31.980]   So that goes from the people that live here to the architecture, to the types of cuisines
[00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.040]   that you can try here.
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.080]   You just meet so many different people with so many different backgrounds.
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.940]   You can eat so much amazing food and you can experience so many different things, no matter
[00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.080]   what your interest is or what your budget is.
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.720]   There's just basically something for everyone, whether you live here or you just come to
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:54.720]   visit.
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:55.720]   So I love that.
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:01.480]   And as someone who works telling people what to do in London, I don't want to ever get
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:07.200]   bored and I never will because there's so much to experience and it's always changing
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.200]   too.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.400]   So I'm going to be here for like 30 years and there's still going to be more for me
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.400]   to check out.
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.400]   And I'll be like, "I haven't been there yet.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.880]   I got to go check that out and see if it's good or not."
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.360]   Is there something that sets it apart from other major metros that of course have diversity,
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.120]   have lots of restaurants, have lots of things to do?
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.120]   Yeah.
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:30.640]   So I think London is a really interesting in-between, in my opinion, of New York and
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.760]   the rest of Europe.
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.520]   So I'm originally from New York.
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.880]   I'm from Long Island, but I've spent time in New York, obviously, I have friends who
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:39.880]   live there.
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.600]   And New York City is go, go, go, right?
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.600]   Which I love.
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.520]   I love that energy and it's really intense.
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:53.040]   And then very generally speaking, a lot of parts of mainland Europe are a lot more relaxed,
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.040]   right?
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:59.520]   When it comes to working culture, basically all of the culture, it's seen as like a lot
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.280]   more relaxed and liberal, whereas London's kind of like in the middle.
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.240]   So it's a really good balance for me.
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:10.240]   And I think a couple of good examples of that is our work-life balance is better here.
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:17.240]   So people are a bit better than say New York about actually leaving work at six o'clock,
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.880]   mainly because people want to get to the pub, which I'm totally down for.
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.760]   I think that's a great motivation, if that's your motivation.
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:25.760]   And yeah.
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.160]   And I think something that's also really unique about London that as someone who lives here,
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:35.360]   I really feel is like super important is that we have so much green space here.
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:41.200]   So compared to my time in New York and other major cities, London's really spread out and
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:46.080]   you're really actually never that far from a beautiful public, free green space that
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.120]   you can enjoy.
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.520]   And I think that works actually for tourists as well.
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.760]   And it's one of the beautiful things you can experience when you come to visit London,
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:53.760]   too.
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:54.760]   So we have green spaces.
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:55.760]   We have gone to a pub.
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.960]   Are there other few other like top London experiences for you?
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.120]   Not for anyone else, just for you.
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.400]   I love Sunday roast.
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.320]   Do you know what Sunday roast is?
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:09.240]   OK, so it's a British tradition of obviously it happens on Sundays where you go to the
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.080]   pub and they on the menu only on Sundays.
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.960]   They have this special roast menu and you choose from different types of meat.
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:23.840]   So it's usually chicken, pork, beef and sometimes a couple other ones or loads of places do
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.560]   vegetarian, which is where I usually go for and also vegan.
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:32.740]   And then basically from the Americans, I always kind of equate it to they bring this plate
[00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:35.920]   out and it's not dissimilar to Thanksgiving food.
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.840]   So it's kind of like you can have Thanksgiving like every Sunday.
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.520]   It's a plate that has roast vegetables on it.
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.040]   There's really good potatoes.
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.680]   They do gravy.
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:52.180]   There's this kind of like a pastry that's called Yorkshire pudding, which is like so
[00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:58.000]   yummy and you use that to soak up the gravy and sometimes there's cauliflower cheese.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.960]   And it's just like a really nice tradition where you gather up your family or you gather
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.120]   up your friends and you're like, let's go for a Sunday roast.
[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:08.720]   You just go to the local pub and sit and you eat Sunday roast.
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.480]   And if you want to have a pint of beer, you can do that, too.
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:15.040]   So I like that's one of my favorite things I always tell people to make sure you get
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.640]   to a pub on a Sunday and experience that.
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:21.560]   What sounds like one thing that is uniquely London is that the pub is something that you
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:22.560]   could do with your family.
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:27.520]   I'm like I'm thinking as someone flying over overseas with a two year old and a six month
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.600]   old, I'm like, oh, you know, we're not really going to have the same trip we used to.
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.120]   It sounds like in London I could just go to the pub with my kids and we could have a beer.
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.120]   You can.
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.120]   Yeah.
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:40.600]   So pubs are really they're very family friendly, especially on the weekends and especially
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.600]   in the areas not they're not as friendly in very central London.
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.340]   So around like the really main touristy areas.
[00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:51.580]   But for example, one of my favorite areas that I tell people to go to for pub experience
[00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:53.140]   is Notting Hill.
[00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:58.100]   And you'll always on a weekend go to the pubs in Notting Hill and see families there and
[00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:02.500]   they've got little kids, they've got teenagers and it's like a family thing.
[00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:06.840]   Sometimes it's big groups of families that will go and it's very normal.
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.300]   They cater to kids.
[00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:11.120]   So it's like nothing out of the ordinary.
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:15.060]   And it's a really nice daytime weekend experience for families.
[00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:16.100]   Awesome.
[00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:20.180]   So while I'm actually planning a trip to London, though, we've already booked flights and where
[00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:21.180]   we're staying.
[00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:22.180]   I'm going to assume most people aren't.
[00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:26.160]   So I want to start this and just talk about all the awesome things there are to do, get
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:27.420]   people excited.
[00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:31.740]   And then at the end, we can wrap up and talk about things like hotels, flights, transportation,
[00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:32.740]   that kind of stuff.
[00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:34.580]   What's the vibe of people in London?
[00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:35.620]   Is it easy to meet people?
[00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:36.740]   Are they friendly?
[00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:38.500]   What should we know about Londoners?
[00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:46.820]   So Londoners are very nice, but we're a little bit more closed off when it comes to meeting
[00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:55.520]   "outsiders" only because I think it comes from that everyone's just really busy and
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:09:00.060]   we just – the British are just a tiny bit more closed off than compared to the Americans,
[00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:03.660]   which everyone's a little bit more closed off that I think compared to us Americans.
[00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:04.660]   Right?
[00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:06.700]   So that's not a hard feat.
[00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:13.240]   That being said, if you do end up talking to somebody who lives in London, generally
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:18.060]   they will be very nice and if you, for example, need help on the street and you can't figure
[00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:21.380]   out where the tube station is, you can stop somebody and they'll be like, "Yeah, yeah.
[00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:22.380]   No worries.
[00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:25.660]   It's just down that way," or they might even walk you.
[00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:29.340]   But it is a little bit harder to meet people.
[00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:31.780]   That does change, though, when alcohol is involved.
[00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:37.900]   It's much easier to make friends when everyone's had a couple of pints.
[00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:41.120]   Is there a type of person you think a trip to London is best for?
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:45.420]   Is it young, old, single kids?
[00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:51.740]   I don't – I mean, I don't think so because there is so much that you can do here.
[00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:56.420]   I think that everyone's basically covered.
[00:09:56.420 --> 00:10:01.600]   I think people that come with kids, maybe it's a little bit harder because if you're
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:06.940]   trying to use public transportation, it is trickier if you've got like a lot of stuff
[00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.780]   that you're carrying or if you've got strollers.
[00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:14.940]   That is tricky because a lot of the tube stations don't have steps or they do have steps and
[00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:19.140]   they don't have escalators or elevators.
[00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:20.420]   So that's tricky.
[00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:23.540]   That being said, though, if you're staying pretty central and you've got kids, a lot
[00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.500]   of people end up just walking everywhere.
[00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:30.540]   So maybe they'll do like an hour walk to get to the first area that they want to go explore.
[00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:31.540]   So it is doable.
[00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:33.980]   I mean, you save money doing that too.
[00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:39.060]   But there is kind of something for everyone and then you just kind of have to adjust based
[00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:40.700]   on your needs and your budget.
[00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:41.700]   Yeah.
[00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:46.820]   For that one, we just bought a super compact light stroller that's like one click pop on
[00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:49.220]   your shoulder, carry a kid down the stairs.
[00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:52.780]   So we are prepared for running around the city.
[00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:57.260]   We don't have one of these giant American bus strollers with us for this trip.
[00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.020]   Is there a best time?
[00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:02.820]   And by all means, if I pick anything, if I tell you I'm staying somewhere and you're
[00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:05.660]   like, that's the worst place to stay or that's the worst time of year to go.
[00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:09.100]   Don't feel bad about offending me like this is for everyone else.
[00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:12.540]   But yeah, when would you say someone should plan their trip?
[00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:15.140]   A lot of it will depend on what your budget is.
[00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:20.180]   So and again, it's not not to be like that every time of year is great to go.
[00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:24.380]   But actually, the beauty of London is that there's always going to be a pro of a time
[00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:26.600]   that you're going to visit and there's going to be a con.
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:30.600]   So for example, you guys are coming in very soon.
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.980]   So that will be middle to end of December.
[00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:35.500]   The pro is it's so festive here.
[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:37.500]   It is incredibly beautiful.
[00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:41.260]   There's so many fun Christmasy things to do if that's what you're into.
[00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:46.500]   There's also like lots of ice skating rinks and there's great shopping.
[00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:51.480]   The downside of that is that it is cold, of course, and also it is very crowded.
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:55.140]   So like what you guys probably are going to want to do is if you want to do some of the
[00:11:55.140 --> 00:12:00.560]   major things like the free museums, like the Natural History Museum, for sure, you'll want
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:05.340]   to avoid weekends because it is right now just like absolutely rammed with people who
[00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:10.260]   come from outside of London, take the train in and take the kids to go do everything.
[00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.580]   So every time of year has a pro and con.
[00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:16.220]   If you come in January, it's really, really cold, but it's also the quietest time and
[00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:17.800]   also the cheapest time.
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:22.660]   If you come in the summer, you're hopefully, fingers crossed, going to get the best weather.
[00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:25.980]   You're also going to get the most sunlight because it stays light till almost 10 o'clock,
[00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:27.740]   which is really cool.
[00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:30.620]   But also the prices are highest because it's peak travel season.
[00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:32.420]   And again, you're going to see those crowds.
[00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:36.240]   And if you get a heat wave, we don't deal with heat waves very well here.
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:38.340]   A lot of places do not have air cons.
[00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:42.420]   So if that's something that like you're considering that would be really tricky for you, then
[00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:45.100]   that's probably not going to be a good time for you to come.
[00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:49.580]   And then shoulder seasons are always great because they've got kind of the mix of the
[00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:50.860]   peak and the downtime.
[00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:51.860]   So, yeah.
[00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:57.620]   So if you want to deal, avoid the summer, I would say avoid Christmas, New Year's kind
[00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:58.620]   of holidays.
[00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:00.940]   But we're going like the two weeks before that.
[00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:04.680]   And we got amazing deals because I think no one wants to.
[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:06.620]   Everyone's traveling in the States for Thanksgiving.
[00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:08.800]   Everyone's traveling around Christmas, New Year's.
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.980]   No one's really traveling the first few weeks of December.
[00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:14.260]   So I think it's a great deal time.
[00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.780]   We'll see how the weekends, how we fare on the weekends.
[00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:19.500]   Maybe those are our park days to just kind of let the kids run wild.
[00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:23.180]   But yeah, I have a friend who always was like, you know what, you can go to any city for
[00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:24.180]   any amount of time.
[00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:28.340]   Is it crazy if you live in New York and it's seven hours to go for the weekend?
[00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:31.100]   Like is it crazy to go for a week, two weeks?
[00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:35.260]   At what point in time do you say maybe if you're going that long, check out some other
[00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:36.700]   place for a few days?
[00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:37.700]   You can do a weekend.
[00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:42.140]   So when I first moved over here and I was working at a travel company, this travel company
[00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:48.500]   was selling to the British crowd these three day trips to New York.
[00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:50.300]   And I was like, that is absurd.
[00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:52.380]   Who would fly all the way to New York for three days?
[00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:53.860]   But I mean, it is doable.
[00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:56.560]   It's actually not that far if you really think about it.
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:57.780]   But it is quite a journey, right?
[00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:05.140]   So I usually say at least a week is a really good amount of time because you can really
[00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:11.380]   dig into some of the areas, not just like the main tourist attractions, but you can
[00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:15.900]   also give yourself time and you don't have to feel like you're rushing around because
[00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:20.700]   you have three days to see whether it's all the main tourist attractions, or if there's
[00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:24.740]   like you want to see Shoreditch and you want to do Notting Hill, but those are really far
[00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:25.740]   apart.
[00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:27.700]   So you're probably not going to do those in the same day.
[00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:35.260]   Just gives you some time to take your time and also be a little bit more spontaneous.
[00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:39.020]   We have for Love in London, we sell a three day itinerary.
[00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:40.140]   That's our most popular thing.
[00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:44.180]   And we also have a six day one, which has actually been really popular as well because
[00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:46.900]   most of my audience are people who are coming from the US.
[00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:51.960]   So they are coming for usually more than three days, but a week is a great amount of time.
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:57.100]   And I usually say if you want to do day trips, I usually recommend not doing them if you
[00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:01.820]   have less than a week because there's just so much you can do in London.
[00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:07.380]   And again, if you're still feeling a bit jet lagged and you've come to London, you've been
[00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:10.300]   running, running, running for the first few days, and then you have to hop on a train
[00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:15.780]   one day and head out to Bath or Oxford or wherever you want to go, that's great.
[00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:18.820]   But also you might want to just slow it down a little bit.
[00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:22.500]   In my opinion, I'm always trying to get people to just be like, OK, there's a lot to do.
[00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:23.740]   So and you can't do it all.
[00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:28.140]   So let's try to like slow down and leave some room for if you see a shop that you want to
[00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:32.500]   go into and spend an hour in or you run past a cafe and you're like, let's just sit for
[00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:36.380]   an hour and have a nice coffee and just relax and you can do that.
[00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:39.140]   So we're going for, I think, six days.
[00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:40.420]   We're not going anywhere else.
[00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:44.460]   Our style of travel, though, to be clear, we haven't actually done this with kids is
[00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:49.200]   much more like I want to get the experience of like being in London, living in London.
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:52.060]   So if we miss some of the tourist destinations, that's fine.
[00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:57.700]   Like London is so central to so many European trips that I'm sure we'll be back in the future.
[00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:01.020]   So I think we're trying to go on the kind of trip you describe.
[00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:04.740]   And I went through one of those itineraries you made and I was like, this is exactly what
[00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:05.740]   I want.
[00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:06.740]   I would say maybe I was like, we have two kids.
[00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:10.060]   It's probably a little over overkill for two kid trip.
[00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:13.340]   But some of those things we'll just we'll just skip.
[00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:16.180]   We talked about the people, but what's the style like?
[00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:18.540]   You know, what is a typical London style?
[00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:19.540]   What are people wearing?
[00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:20.540]   What are people?
[00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:21.540]   How do people?
[00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:22.540]   Yeah, you know.
[00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:24.840]   So I it's funny because people ask me that.
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:29.660]   And like a few years ago, I used to kind of have an as like a specific idea.
[00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:34.900]   And now because of how fashion is, it actually depends on what area that you're in in London
[00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:41.020]   and what kind of place that you're in, what type of restaurant people in London have,
[00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:43.860]   like a really big range of style.
[00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:48.060]   We do have a lot of people who work in fashion here.
[00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:50.420]   And so there's a lot of people who dress quite trendy.
[00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:52.660]   There's a lot of people who dress very classic.
[00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:58.460]   So, you know, the usual like trench coat, kind of what you would expect.
[00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:03.740]   So the nice thing is you can kind of wear what you are comfortable in.
[00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:08.220]   I would usually say, though, and again, if we're speaking to the American audience, that
[00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:14.900]   generally in London, people are a little bit more dressed up than people tend to be in
[00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:15.900]   the US.
[00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:19.520]   So if you tend to be like really casual when you go out to eat and you're going to a nice
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:23.140]   place when you come to London, you're probably going to want to like just judge it up just
[00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:28.460]   a little bit like and just to feel like you're going to kind of like fit in a little bit
[00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:29.460]   more.
[00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:33.800]   But like I said, it's a major city and you're never you're not going to be like reprimanded
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:35.340]   for what you're wearing.
[00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:38.540]   No one's going to like poke fun at you or anything like that.
[00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:41.820]   It's like everyone's too worried about themselves, to be honest.
[00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:43.820]   So you're totally fine.
[00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:46.260]   Yeah, it's it's a really interesting mix.
[00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:49.900]   And actually, like if you go to East London, the style is very, very different.
[00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:52.220]   East London is very trendy.
[00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:54.740]   A lot of artists live around and work around there.
[00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:59.460]   So and then if you go to West London, like to Notting Hill, that's where you'll find
[00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:02.300]   more of like the classic looks.
[00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:04.180]   But then there's also mixes of both in those.
[00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:06.220]   So it's really quite interesting.
[00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:07.220]   What about food?
[00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:10.560]   Is it is it is London, you know, you said there's lots of cuisines for all the world.
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:13.620]   But would you say London's like a foodie town for drinks?
[00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:14.860]   Is it like there's pubs?
[00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:16.380]   So is it more of a beer crowd?
[00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:20.460]   You know, California seems like it's more wine and now cocktails in the city.
[00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:21.460]   Yeah.
[00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:22.800]   So everything all of the above.
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:27.760]   So London's amazing of just you can just you can try any cuisine here from all over the
[00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:32.140]   world, which I think is something I do see that's a little bit of a mistake from tourists
[00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:38.020]   sometimes is that you come to London and you only just want to have British food, which
[00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:43.200]   I'm not saying don't have British food, like have try fish and chips, bangers and mash,
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:46.840]   the pie, like totally do that if that's what you want to do.
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:52.480]   But there's also so many different cuisines that especially if like if you don't think
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:56.120]   you're ever going to get to Malaysia, why don't you try like Malaysian food or Sri
[00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:57.400]   Lankan food?
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:02.520]   And you can really expand your palate and try cuisines that you might not ever get to
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:06.040]   try again if you're never going to go to like a major metropolitan city.
[00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:09.840]   So we have a huge foodie scene here.
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:10.840]   Same with drinks.
[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:13.600]   So pubs are huge, but also cocktail bars.
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:16.400]   We've got great wine bars.
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:22.080]   There's drinking for the lower end of the budget and just like rowdy, like more fun
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:23.320]   younger crowds.
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:30.700]   Then there's also really fancy speakeasies and really like exclusive cocktail bars.
[00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:31.760]   Anything you can want.
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:32.760]   We've got it here.
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:37.760]   So again, like this is what's so cool about London is that anything that you want, you're
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:38.880]   going to be able to find it.
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:42.000]   You just kind of have to like do a little sifting.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.200]   So we're going to get into a lot of these things and I want some real recommendations.
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.480]   What you said a mistake is eating just British food.
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:50.080]   I feel like British food has a pretty terrible reputation.
[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:53.440]   So I'm like, man, if you're if that's what you're coming to London for, you're probably
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:54.760]   doing it wrong.
[00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:57.160]   What other mistakes are people making when they're coming to London?
[00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:59.640]   Well, I am going to caveat that what you just said, actually.
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:02.400]   So British food has gotten much better.
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:05.000]   So you can do really well.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.240]   And if you do want to have British food, I always say the best place is at pubs because
[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:14.800]   most pubs will have restaurant sections and they'll have like classic pub menus or they'll
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:20.000]   do they'll be more of like a gastropub and do a modern take on similar British dishes.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.200]   So it is good.
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:23.920]   But yeah, I just wanted to throw that in there.
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:27.840]   But I think it is definitely the type of food that you'll get sick of after like eating
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:28.920]   it three times in a row.
[00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:29.920]   So for sure.
[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:30.920]   Yeah.
[00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:35.280]   And I think I watched a few of your videos and one of them was like, if it says it's
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:39.080]   like truly authentic pub, just like run away.
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:40.080]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:44.000]   It's one of those things like if you have to say it, you probably aren't.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.400]   So I do forget what your original question was.
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:49.400]   Other mistakes.
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:51.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:56.980]   So something that I have been seeing with tourists recently is there's a lot of content
[00:20:56.980 --> 00:21:02.160]   around when you use public transportation here that you have to get an Oyster card,
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:04.080]   which I used to always talk about this.
[00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:06.880]   So a lot of people are seeing some of my old videos.
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:11.520]   An Oyster card is basically something that you can buy once you get here, where you add
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:16.440]   your money to it and you use it to tap in and out for the underground system or to use
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:17.440]   the buses.
[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:19.520]   But then you have to keep topping it up.
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:24.560]   You also have to pay seven pounds for each of the cards and it's non-refundable.
[00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:29.560]   So instead, I'm just trying to tell people you can actually use Apple Pay or Google Pay
[00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:31.480]   and you don't have to worry about doing the top up.
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:35.240]   And also, if you have any credit or debit cards that are contactless, you can use those
[00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:36.240]   too.
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:37.240]   You don't have to use your credit card.
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:40.400]   You don't have to wait in the queue to top it up at the station every time you run out
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:41.400]   of credit.
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:44.680]   So that's something I see quite a lot.
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:51.720]   I also see a lot of people who think that you have to spend a ton of money on their
[00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:58.200]   hotel to make sure that they're in a safe area or they're just at a safe property.
[00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:03.580]   And they end up sticking to, let's say, some of the big U.S. corporate brands, which is
[00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:04.580]   fine.
[00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:05.580]   That's fine.
[00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:06.580]   That's fine and stuff.
[00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:09.480]   So a lot of people are trying to stick to the Marriotts and this and that, blah, blah,
[00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:10.480]   blah.
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:11.720]   That's completely fine.
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:18.720]   But we have so many amazing, safe boutique hotel properties that are so beautiful and
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.600]   interesting and they're small.
[00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:23.960]   And they're in great areas too, even if they're not in very central London.
[00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:29.640]   So I would say don't ever discount something that looks like it's a good deal if it just
[00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:34.040]   doesn't seem like it's something that's a name that's recognizable to you or it's in
[00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:38.920]   an area that you don't necessarily recognize as Covent Garden or Soho right in the center
[00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:40.320]   of London.
[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:44.680]   So yeah, you could end up in a really amazing hotel and also in a cool area.
[00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:49.660]   Is there a good rating site in the UK that's like, "Oh, I'm looking at this hotel.
[00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:50.660]   Is it good?"
[00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:55.520]   I don't personally put a lot of faith in TripAdvisor.
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:59.880]   And so I'm curious, whether it's restaurants or hotels, is there a thing?
[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:03.200]   So for hotels, I personally use Booking.com.
[00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:06.480]   I find that the ratings generally are on point.
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:08.400]   And then obviously, you can just book right through Booking.com.
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:09.400]   So it's really easy.
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:10.400]   I use that.
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:13.880]   I don't really use TripAdvisor for anything actually anymore.
[00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:20.160]   And then in terms of food, so we don't have like a Yelp here.
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:24.040]   And TripAdvisor is generally tourists.
[00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:31.760]   So I would say if you're looking for like what locals think about food or a bar or something
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:35.960]   like that, probably like Google Reviews, which you never really know.
[00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:42.760]   But I think that's where most Londoners would go if they're looking for reviews in a style
[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:46.240]   that's a site like that with like actual reviews from people.
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:53.560]   Otherwise, we have websites like The Infatuation is really big here, Time Out, Love & London.
[00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:59.160]   I don't know if you heard of it, but we talk about food and drink and all the things, of
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:00.160]   course.
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:01.160]   Yeah.
[00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:03.760]   So you briefly said something about safety.
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:06.200]   Like, is there dangerous parts of London?
[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:07.760]   Should people be concerned at all?
[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:12.920]   I feel like I had this one realization where I was reading this Lonely Planet book for
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:13.920]   New York for fun.
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:17.280]   I think someone we knew was traveling around the States and it was like, New York, make
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:20.280]   sure you get a money belt and you put all of your money in your money belt and tuck
[00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:21.280]   it in your pants.
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:24.600]   And I was like, I've been to New York dozens of times.
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:25.600]   It's never crossed my mind.
[00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:26.600]   I've lived there.
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:28.200]   Never been a thing.
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:30.160]   Is everyone just always kind of scaring people?
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:31.840]   So what's the lowdown there?
[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:33.160]   Are there places to avoid?
[00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:35.780]   Are there times a day to avoid?
[00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:38.740]   Is the tube rampant with pickpockets?
[00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:44.200]   There are areas in London that are, relatively speaking, not safe, but they're never where
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:45.880]   tourists are going to end up.
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:48.880]   So I always say, don't worry about the area.
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:50.920]   It's never a place that you would ever go.
[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:55.600]   So it doesn't have anything that you would want to go to anyway.
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:58.680]   So areas are completely fine.
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:03.760]   In terms of pickpockets and things like that, just like you would in any other city, just
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:05.320]   keep your stuff close to you.
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:06.800]   Don't have your phone waving around.
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:12.840]   We do have a little bit of a problem at the moment of mopeds going by and grabbing phones
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:13.880]   out of hands.
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:18.400]   So that's really the main thing, but otherwise, just the same rules you would apply to any
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:19.880]   major city.
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:21.400]   Don't have your pockets open.
[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:25.960]   Don't have anything in the back pocket where people can easily take it from you.
[00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:28.400]   Keep everything zipped up, everything close to you.
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:31.720]   Don't have any valuables out in plain sight.
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:37.640]   But millions of people run around the city every day and have absolutely no problem.
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:40.960]   So it's really nothing to be concerned about.
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:49.400]   And I think in terms of safety at night, generally, the only thing I would say is that women on
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:50.880]   their own...
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:56.680]   So I usually, past 11 o'clock, will get an Uber to get home.
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:26:01.120]   But if I was with somebody else, then we're fine to be on public transport and to walk
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:02.120]   on our own.
[00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:05.200]   So yeah, you can take that.
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:08.120]   People can interpret it as how they want to.
[00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:09.680]   I want to get a lay of the land.
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:13.280]   And we could spend so long talking about, "Here's this neighbor, that neighbor."
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:17.960]   But is there generally a way you break up the city and kind of group it into a few major
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:18.960]   areas?
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:24.800]   The most popular area that tourists a lot of times only stay in is what's called central
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:25.800]   London.
[00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:33.480]   Which is the really famous areas like Soho, Covent Garden, Marlebone, the South Bank,
[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:38.880]   Westminster, which is where Buckingham Palace, Houses of Parliament, all those places are.
[00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:41.240]   And it includes a few other areas.
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:44.880]   That's where the majority of the tourist attractions are.
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:47.320]   And it is the dead center of London.
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:53.520]   So that's where even Londoners will go there if we're meeting a friend for dinner and we
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:56.200]   both live on other parts of the city.
[00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:59.040]   So that's where a lot of tourists end up doing a lot of stuff.
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:03.520]   There's lots of good restaurants around there and bars and things like that.
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:04.520]   You just have to know where you're going.
[00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:07.040]   So there's also some really not so good stuff there.
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:09.200]   It's like very tourist trappy and kind of gross.
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:14.340]   It's those like authentic pub kind of places that you'll find there.
[00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:21.880]   And then beyond that, there is basically the city's broken up into four major areas, simply
[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:26.280]   North London, South London, East London and West London.
[00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:32.800]   And in each of those areas, there's a few main areas that I would say that tourists
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:37.600]   are more likely to go to because there's things to do and it's not only just kind of like
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:38.600]   neighborhood-y.
[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:44.040]   There's good bars, good restaurants, parks, activities, things like that.
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:47.080]   So personally for me, I live in East London.
[00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:50.280]   That's my favorite part of the city.
[00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:56.520]   There's just lots of stuff to do around here and it's fun and beautiful.
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:28:01.160]   But then West London has Notting Hill and lots of great museums and really interesting
[00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:02.720]   things to do there.
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:06.980]   And North and South also have their great things too.
[00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:14.520]   And we also, as Londoners, we have this like really big divide of we self-identify if we're
[00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:18.260]   East or West London and we think the other side is terrible.
[00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:19.680]   We don't know why people live there.
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:23.200]   And then the same with North of the River, which is the River Thames or South of the
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:24.200]   River.
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:28.080]   And there's like this constant battle of like, "Why would you live on the other side?
[00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:29.280]   It's so boring there."
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:32.960]   And it's just always been like that.
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:36.880]   Let's highlight a couple neighborhoods where you're like, "These are just really cool spots."
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:40.300]   Whether you stay there, you spend an afternoon or a morning there, what would you put on
[00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:46.600]   your list of like, I don't know, three or four awesome neighborhoods in London?
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:47.600]   Not all in East London.
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:49.600]   I know you think it's the coolest place ever, but...
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:50.600]   Okay.
[00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:51.600]   Fine.
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:52.600]   Fine.
[00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:53.600]   Right.
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:54.600]   So I've said Notting Hill a lot.
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:55.600]   I think that's a really famous one.
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:57.120]   So I might not spend too much time on that.
[00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:01.960]   But Notting Hill is a really beautiful area and it's one of the few areas of London where
[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:07.760]   even though it's quite popular with tourists, it still has a really interesting local vibe
[00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:10.880]   where neighbors actually say hello to each other.
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:13.360]   People pass by each other on the streets.
[00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:15.720]   The actual Londoners that live there are...
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:20.840]   It's a really lovely community area and that's why the pub scene around there is so great.
[00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:24.720]   And that's why I always recommend people to go do pub hopping around there for like a
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:27.120]   nice relaxed afternoon.
[00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:34.320]   It's not like a crazy like, "Let's get drunk pub," kind of area.
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:35.320]   And then if we...
[00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:40.720]   But if we skip on past Notting Hill, in North London, there's an area called Hampstead,
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:45.480]   which has the main thing there is this park called Hampstead Heath.
[00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:49.260]   And it's this beautiful big park that has viewpoints.
[00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:53.840]   There's swimming ponds that people go to in the summer.
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:56.440]   There's Kenwood House, which if...
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:59.440]   Have you ever seen the movie Notting Hill actually, Chris?
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:00.880]   I'm not sure if I have.
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:04.800]   Like when you say it, I'm like, "Of course, it's a movie.
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:05.800]   I remember it."
[00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:06.800]   But now I'm like, "Have I?
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:07.800]   I don't know."
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:08.800]   That's okay.
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:13.400]   Well, if you do watch it, and I'm sure there will be people listening that have seen it.
[00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:21.360]   Kenwood House is featured in the movie towards the end when she's filming this like Victorian
[00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:25.280]   film and Hugh Grant's like listening to her speak.
[00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:26.280]   And it's a whole thing.
[00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:28.720]   You'll have to watch it at some point.
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:31.960]   So the house that's featured in that is in Hampstead Heath.
[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:36.040]   So people like go to Hampstead Heath to see this beautiful Victorian house, which actually
[00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:43.400]   is also a little museum that has art and other things that you can see in there.
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:45.720]   So that's a really good jumping off point.
[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:49.120]   Really great to take kids there because they can run around and see the wildlife.
[00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:50.320]   They can see people swimming.
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:54.840]   They can go swimming if that's maybe not right now, but it'll take a while.
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:55.840]   Probably not on this trip.
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:56.840]   Yeah.
[00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:57.840]   Not this trip.
[00:30:57.840 --> 00:30:58.840]   Not this trip.
[00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:03.760]   And then you can go into Hampstead Village, which has really great cafes, bars, restaurants,
[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:05.360]   and it's super family friendly.
[00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:10.600]   It's also this really just beautiful area with like multi-million pound houses.
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:16.160]   A lot of celebrities live around here and there's a lot of historical value.
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:17.160]   So that's Hampstead.
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:18.160]   Yeah.
[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:23.840]   And then, I mean, it's hard to pick because there's so many and I love to kind of talk
[00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:27.320]   a little bit more about the areas that people don't go to as much.
[00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:33.200]   Like if we go to South London, there's an area that's called Brixton and Brixton is
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:38.520]   super diverse, has really great markets that have been around for ages and they have vendors
[00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:44.760]   selling like all different types of wares and as well as there's little wine bars, there's
[00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:46.760]   little shops there.
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:53.480]   So yeah, Brixton is just a really cool, interesting area with lots of up and coming bars and restaurants
[00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:57.760]   and just lots of interesting things to do down there.
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:03.040]   If you're going to stay central though, there's an area that I really like going to that's
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:04.480]   called Seven Dials.
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:09.320]   So it's really close to Covent Garden, which is one of the most famous areas in central
[00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:10.320]   to go.
[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:14.680]   But Seven Dials is basically seven streets that converge onto each other and there's
[00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:16.400]   a sundial in the middle of it.
[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:19.140]   That's obviously where the name comes from.
[00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:27.040]   And down these streets, there's some not independent places, but there's also lots of great independent
[00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:29.060]   cafes and restaurants.
[00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:34.520]   There's a couple of pubs in the area and there's a really great indoor food market called Seven
[00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:37.680]   Dials Food Market, which I highly recommend.
[00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:43.480]   And then there's also this hidden little courtyard that's called Neal's Yard, which you can go
[00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:44.480]   into.
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:50.180]   It's where it's the home of Neal's Yard Remedies, which is quite a famous skincare brand.
[00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:57.760]   And in there you'll find this fantastic wine bar called CVS and also one of my favorite
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:00.360]   restaurants in London called The Barbary.
[00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:03.360]   And now they have a new place next door called The Barbary next door.
[00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:08.240]   And they do food that's inspired by the Barbary Coast.
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:10.860]   And it's so good, really, really good.
[00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:14.520]   So it's one of those ways I'm like, I don't really love telling people about this, but
[00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:15.680]   I don't want to gatekeep.
[00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:23.080]   So yeah, really yummy food there, but it's a really cute, colorful little courtyard.
[00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:25.320]   And so it looks really nice in photos as well.
[00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:29.560]   And you can sit there, have a glass of wine, have some food, have a coffee.
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:30.560]   It's great.
[00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:31.560]   Awesome.
[00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:33.920]   And then I am going to circle over to East London.
[00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:35.680]   It is my favorite.
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:37.040]   There's an area called Shoreditch.
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:40.720]   This is probably the most popular area of East London.
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:46.420]   And it is very eclectic, is the area that's the most popular for street art.
[00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:49.600]   So if you are really interested in seeing street art, this is where you're going to
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:50.600]   do it.
[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:54.440]   You can either walk around on your own and easily find it, or there's loads of like really
[00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:58.480]   affordable or free street art tours that you can do.
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:05.920]   This is also where a lot of creative agencies are based, a lot of artistic agencies.
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:10.720]   So a lot of the people that are in this area, even during the week, are very creative.
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:14.900]   So you always kind of feel that vibe while you're there.
[00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:19.560]   And of course, you're going to have good cafes, good coffee, fantastic restaurants.
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:24.160]   This is a really, I come to this area a lot to eat.
[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:25.160]   Where?
[00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:27.440]   Just like one level, cafes, coffee shops.
[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:28.440]   A little bit more.
[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:29.440]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:30.440]   Where do you go?
[00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:37.520]   So one of the restaurants that I love is called Bao, and they do Taiwanese bao buns.
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:41.480]   And in Shoreditch, they have a noodle shop, which is really good.
[00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:44.000]   So highly recommend going there.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.360]   And for cafes, there's, God, there's a lot of places.
[00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:50.400]   Attendant Cafe is really good.
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:52.720]   They do really nice coffee.
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:58.280]   And probably the most popular cafe around this area at the moment is a place called
[00:34:58.280 --> 00:34:59.860]   Jolene.
[00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:05.440]   And there is basically always a line outside the door, especially on the weekends.
[00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:07.480]   But the coffee here is just fantastic.
[00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:09.280]   And they do great pastries as well.
[00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:12.080]   So if you want coffee, that's a good spot to go.
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:13.080]   Awesome.
[00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:14.080]   All right.
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:15.680]   So I feel like kind of got a little bit of lay of the land.
[00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:18.060]   Obviously, I'm gonna have to walk around.
[00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:20.600]   You talked earlier about how you have these awesome itinerary.
[00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:23.780]   So I've been going through the three day because I was like, I don't want to plan too much.
[00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:28.120]   So let's take the three day spread it out over six day.
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:32.400]   What do you think things people should be really trying to do on their trip?
[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:36.160]   You know, I'm sure someone could find a list best attractions in London, like we don't
[00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:38.040]   need to go through everything.
[00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:39.640]   What are the highlights of an itinerary?
[00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:45.000]   I mean, of course, everybody wants to go see the House of Parliament and Big Ben and Westminster
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   Bridge.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.500]   But I think like do whatever the sites that you're really interested in, make sure you
[00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:53.500]   do them because I get it like you're in London, right?
[00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:57.140]   And you've seen these things on TV and in movies for years.
[00:35:57.140 --> 00:35:58.680]   So make sure you do that.
[00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:02.820]   For me, I think I'm always trying to think of like an interesting way to see something.
[00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:07.420]   So I think a good example is everyone knows the Tower of London, right?
[00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:13.180]   So the Tower of London, it's been around for like 1000 years, and it's still in this place.
[00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:16.500]   And you can go and have tours there.
[00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:18.260]   They're very family friendly.
[00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:22.900]   But you can also do something that's quite interesting, which is called the Ceremony
[00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:24.580]   of the Keys.
[00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:30.740]   And what this is, it's a tradition that's been happening for 700 years.
[00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:34.780]   And they've done it every single day for 700 years, except I think there's one day during
[00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:38.140]   one of the wars that they had to stop doing it.
[00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:41.180]   And you go, you got tickets for it.
[00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:45.440]   And you basically watch this tradition of where they exchange the keys when they're
[00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:48.920]   kind of like closing up the tower at night.
[00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:50.940]   And it's never been recorded.
[00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:53.620]   You're not allowed to take your phone or you're not allowed to film it.
[00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:55.380]   You're not allowed to take pictures.
[00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:59.580]   And I think it's a really interesting, different way to experience this like really popular
[00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:00.580]   tourist attractions.
[00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:03.460]   And it's very hard to get tickets.
[00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:04.460]   But it's definitely doable.
[00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:09.900]   And the tickets are only five pounds, whereas it's usually I think about 25 pounds for adults
[00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:13.700]   to get in at normal times of the day.
[00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:16.380]   So I think that's really cool.
[00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:21.020]   In terms of viewpoint, so a lot of people like to do the London Eye, which that's cool.
[00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:23.620]   The first time I ever came to London, I did the London Eye as well.
[00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:25.260]   I thought it was great.
[00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:29.340]   It is a bit of a steep price for the tickets.
[00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:34.300]   So if you still want to do some kind of viewpoint, but maybe you don't need to do the London
[00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:38.660]   Eye, you could go to this place called the Sky Garden, which is completely free to visit.
[00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:43.240]   And it's actually higher up than the London Eye.
[00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:45.340]   It's basically this garden in the sky.
[00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:49.140]   You take a lift all the way up to the top of the building that's called the walkie talkie
[00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:52.060]   building because it looks like a walkie talkie.
[00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:54.700]   And there's all this plant life that you walk around.
[00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:58.660]   But there's also these amazing views over the London skyline.
[00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:01.900]   It's pretty cool and a lot cheaper, obviously.
[00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:05.900]   I know you're like the spokesperson for London on YouTube, in my mind.
[00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:08.100]   But don't be afraid to be like, this is not worth it.
[00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:09.700]   Don't waste your time there.
[00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:14.060]   You know, I know you've said that about Leicester Square, but.
[00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:15.060]   Yeah.
[00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:20.180]   Leicester Square is for sure the number one thing that I'm like, avoid it at all costs.
[00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:25.180]   Like I even will walk around it if I'm just navigating to get somewhere else in the city.
[00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:32.100]   Obviously, Leicester Square is this part of central London where it's just lined with
[00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:36.200]   like McDonald's, Burger King.
[00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:37.940]   There's a couple of casinos.
[00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:39.460]   There's a couple of movie theaters.
[00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:43.300]   There's the M&M store, which I have so much disdain for the M&M store.
[00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:44.300]   I just don't understand.
[00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:47.060]   And there's always such a line to get into it.
[00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:48.340]   The Lego store.
[00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:49.820]   There's just no...
[00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:54.140]   For some reason, there's so much stuff out there saying to go see Leicester Square.
[00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:55.540]   I'm like, there's nothing here.
[00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:56.540]   This is...
[00:38:56.540 --> 00:38:57.540]   It's just...
[00:38:57.540 --> 00:38:58.540]   And it's...
[00:38:58.540 --> 00:38:59.540]   I don't know.
[00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:00.540]   It's not upkept very well.
[00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:01.540]   And so I always say to avoid that.
[00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:05.780]   Instead, you could actually go just one block over and you're in Chinatown, which is amazing.
[00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:10.220]   We have a small Chinatown in London, but really good food.
[00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:14.300]   There's some hidden bars there and just a really interesting place to walk around.
[00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:17.700]   So I'm always like, skip Leicester Square.
[00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:18.700]   Instead go to Chinatown.
[00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:19.700]   It's literally one block over.
[00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:23.460]   Do you have a favorite hidden bar?
[00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:31.580]   So in Chinatown, there's one that's called Opium and it's a green door that is unmarked
[00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:35.660]   and you go up the stairs and there's three different rooms and the cocktails are really
[00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:36.660]   good.
[00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:43.500]   They're super unique and different, but they're all oriental themed.
[00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:47.220]   So they are super interesting and they serve food there as well.
[00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:48.220]   But the cocktails...
[00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:49.220]   Go for the cocktails.
[00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:54.100]   But that's hard to pick a favorite hidden bar, but I actually went to a really good
[00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:56.380]   one last night called Nightjar.
[00:39:56.380 --> 00:40:00.420]   There's two different locations and it's Prohibition themed.
[00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:05.540]   So you go like down the stairs, the cocktails are...
[00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:12.900]   The menu is like themed with different parts of the Prohibition and the war and the servers
[00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:17.460]   are dressed up like they're old timey and the service is amazing and the cocktails are
[00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:18.980]   really cool.
[00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:22.820]   And are these the kind of places where you need to make a reservation?
[00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:24.140]   How does that typically work?
[00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:25.140]   Yes.
[00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:26.140]   Yeah.
[00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:28.940]   So especially recently, London is very...
[00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:33.140]   You have to make reservations to get into places, especially the ones that are quite
[00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:36.700]   popular even if they are kind of under the radar.
[00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:40.060]   People still find out about them because Londoners love under the radar stuff.
[00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:46.980]   So anytime you can make a reservation, I highly, highly recommend it because also a lot of
[00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:48.820]   places in London are just very small.
[00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:50.820]   So they have very little covers.
[00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:54.260]   So if 10 people show up, that might cover the whole restaurant.
[00:40:54.260 --> 00:41:00.100]   So anytime you can make a reservation for sure, or go very early or very late and you
[00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:01.100]   might be okay.
[00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:02.100]   It's funny.
[00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:03.540]   I'm like such an optimizer.
[00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:05.420]   And normally I'm like, "Okay, I'm going to research all this stuff."
[00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:08.780]   And then I was looking through your three-day itinerary, I was like, "This is pretty good.
[00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:09.780]   You just put it together."
[00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:12.980]   So for me, normally I would want to go through all this and I was like, "Why don't we just
[00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:13.980]   use this?
[00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:14.980]   Why don't we just...
[00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:16.420]   This is our new playbook and save us a lot of time."
[00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:18.140]   So I appreciate that.
[00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:24.220]   But high level, any other must-see things that people need to do when they're here for
[00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:25.660]   a short trip?
[00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:33.060]   Personally, my mindset for what I do is that there's not really any must-sees because it
[00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:35.340]   completely depends on what you're interested in.
[00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:39.740]   So some people might say, "Oh, you have to go to the National Portrait Gallery."
[00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:46.100]   But if you're not into portrait art, even though it's free to go into, don't waste
[00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:47.500]   your time there.
[00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:50.860]   Find art that you like or skip art altogether if you're not...
[00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:53.860]   The tape modern is not going to be interesting to you if you're not interested in modern
[00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:54.860]   art.
[00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:57.660]   So yeah, I definitely...
[00:41:57.660 --> 00:42:02.220]   I'm trying to give people the permission to don't feel like you have to do something because
[00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:05.060]   someone has said like, "You have to do London Eye."
[00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:06.060]   You don't have to.
[00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:07.060]   There's so many things you can do.
[00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:10.220]   Just do whatever is going to work for you and also your budget because some of the stuff
[00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:12.180]   is really pricey.
[00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:15.820]   So if you're going to take the four of you on the London Eye, that's going to cost you
[00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:21.900]   like £100, then is that really going to feel worth it if you weren't really that interested?
[00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:25.220]   Are there deals for some of these things that I should know about going in?
[00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:28.660]   Like, I don't know, book it in advance or buy it from this guy who works down this alley
[00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:29.660]   in the street?
[00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:34.820]   If you want to do the main attractions, I always tell people to look into the London
[00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:40.660]   Pass, which it's got like 150 of the biggest attractions on this pass.
[00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:46.100]   And you get a two-day pass, a three-day pass, a six-day pass, whatever you choose.
[00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:49.540]   And the tickets are included in the price that you pay.
[00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:55.060]   And if it works with what you want to see, you can save a lot of money with that.
[00:42:55.060 --> 00:43:00.180]   You just have to plan and do some math to make sure that it all adds up.
[00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:04.540]   Because if you're mostly wanting to see stuff that has low ticket prices, then it's probably
[00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:05.540]   not going to be worth it.
[00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:09.380]   But if you're going to the big things with big ticket prices, it does end up saving and
[00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:14.420]   especially if you've got four of you, five of you, because they have kids passes as well.
[00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:17.860]   It actually can end up saving you like hundreds of dollars.
[00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:19.100]   It's actually kind of crazy.
[00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:21.900]   So yeah, the London Pass.
[00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:25.580]   We do have something on our website where it helps people understand if it's going to
[00:43:25.580 --> 00:43:27.500]   work for them or not before they buy it.
[00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:31.020]   So if you just Google "London Pass" on our site, that's helpful.
[00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:33.100]   I'll link to that page on the show notes.
[00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:34.100]   Perfect.
[00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:35.100]   Okay, great.
[00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:39.460]   Speaking of the Sunday roast that we were talking about, another British tradition here
[00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:41.700]   is called afternoon tea.
[00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:44.540]   And I personally love afternoon tea.
[00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:49.460]   So basically what you do is you go to, it's mostly hotels that will put on afternoon tea.
[00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:51.900]   Some restaurants do it as well.
[00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:55.980]   Around like one o'clock, two o'clock, you'll go to this hotel that you've booked and they
[00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:58.500]   bring out your selection of tea.
[00:43:58.500 --> 00:44:01.260]   You get to choose if you want tea or coffee.
[00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:05.740]   If you go really high end, they'll have like extra specialty that's been flown in from
[00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:08.820]   Sri Lanka or India or wherever.
[00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:11.860]   It's like really a beautiful experience.
[00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:15.860]   And then you get a bunch of different types of treats.
[00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:22.540]   So we'll start with little finger sandwiches of various variety of different kinds.
[00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:27.140]   Then you'll also get scones, which I love scones.
[00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:32.460]   Scones are basically, they're like kind of resemble crumpets, but they're a little bit
[00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:33.460]   nicer than crumpets.
[00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:36.340]   They're a lot nicer than crumpets in my opinion.
[00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:42.500]   And you eat those with jam and cream.
[00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:47.660]   And then the final tier is the sweet treats.
[00:44:47.660 --> 00:44:51.580]   So the really nice places, this is where like they shine.
[00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:59.700]   They do these little pieces of artwork that you eat for your lunch slash breakfast, whatever
[00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:01.500]   time you ended up going.
[00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:02.820]   And it's a really lovely experience.
[00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:07.860]   A lot of people in London will do it as like a special occasion for someone's birthday
[00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:10.980]   or for bridal showers and things like that.
[00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:14.980]   But it's very British and it's lovely.
[00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:16.340]   It's really lovely.
[00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:21.220]   One of the places that I always recommend if you want like a very classic traditional afternoon
[00:45:21.220 --> 00:45:25.820]   tea experience is Fortnum & Mason, which is a department store.
[00:45:25.820 --> 00:45:30.940]   And they've got a beautiful tea room, which was, I think the queen actually opened it
[00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:32.780]   up if I remember correctly.
[00:45:32.780 --> 00:45:33.860]   Yeah.
[00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:34.860]   It's very classic.
[00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:36.980]   They've got like the classical music playing.
[00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:38.940]   Somebody's playing piano.
[00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:42.220]   You can get champagne if you want champagne.
[00:45:42.220 --> 00:45:47.900]   So I recommend either there or if you want something really special with amazing views,
[00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:52.540]   there is the Shard, which is the tallest building in Western Europe.
[00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:57.500]   And there's the Shangri-La Hotel, which is in the Shard and their restaurant Ting does
[00:45:57.500 --> 00:46:01.420]   a sky high afternoon tea, which they like pull out all the stops.
[00:46:01.420 --> 00:46:03.900]   It's really, it's an amazing experience.
[00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:07.780]   This is also something that as we did some research, it's like not everywhere, but many
[00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:11.380]   places are pretty kid friendly and even sometimes like kid themed.
[00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:15.020]   So it looked pretty cool as something we could do with the kids.
[00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:16.380]   Yes, definitely.
[00:46:16.380 --> 00:46:21.420]   Also, if you want another recommendation for a kid friendly tea at the One Aldwych Hotel,
[00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:26.020]   they do a Charlie and the Chocolate Factory themed tea, which is really great for the
[00:46:26.020 --> 00:46:29.280]   adults as well, but they have the kids love it too.
[00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:31.580]   So it's like really cute.
[00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:34.880]   So I have a random question, but specific, very specific to tea.
[00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:35.880]   So we looked at this one.
[00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:40.380]   It seems like make reservations for most of these places, but I was looking at the menu
[00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:43.020]   and I guess either it's an entire meal, right?
[00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:46.140]   Like it doesn't, it looks like it's enough food that like you're skipping lunch that
[00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:47.140]   day.
[00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:50.260]   Or I was like, Oh, our daughter usually naps like one.
[00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:51.260]   What if we went at three o'clock?
[00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:53.540]   I don't want to ruin dinner.
[00:46:53.540 --> 00:46:57.580]   Would it be poor form to go and just get like one or two for four people?
[00:46:57.580 --> 00:46:59.980]   Or do you need to order one for every person?
[00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:03.100]   So you, it's a bit different with kids.
[00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:06.540]   If you've got like really little ones, then you don't have to order ones for them, obviously
[00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:09.740]   if they're not going to eat it, but you usually do order one for each person.
[00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:10.740]   Okay.
[00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:11.740]   Yeah.
[00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:12.740]   I was looking for like a little deal.
[00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:14.740]   If you just want a little snack here and there.
[00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:15.740]   I know.
[00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:16.740]   Well, the kids ones are cheaper.
[00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:18.300]   So they're like significantly cheaper.
[00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:19.300]   So that's good.
[00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:20.700]   But actually a lot of people ask me that.
[00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:22.060]   So that's a good question.
[00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:23.060]   Yeah.
[00:47:23.060 --> 00:47:25.980]   Whenever my wife and I do like a tasting menu, we're like, can we just do wine for one of
[00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:26.980]   us?
[00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:28.900]   And then we just, because we don't need six glasses of wine.
[00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:31.100]   So we'll just do the tasty menu with wine.
[00:47:31.100 --> 00:47:33.660]   And one person doesn't do the wine, but then we just share.
[00:47:33.660 --> 00:47:39.160]   So little, little things like that after any other cool experiences, even if they're small,
[00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:43.960]   like I'll say in New York city, one of my favorite things to tell people to do is if
[00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:49.540]   you're downtown, take the six train at the end of the line and just ride it South till
[00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:51.340]   it turns around and comes back North.
[00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:54.660]   And you loop through city hall station, which is an closed station.
[00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:56.540]   It's like many, many years old.
[00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:57.540]   It's really cool.
[00:47:57.540 --> 00:48:01.380]   It was like the shining star of the subway system, but it's not open and you can like
[00:48:01.380 --> 00:48:03.260]   once or twice a year, get a tour there.
[00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:07.140]   But if you just ride the six train, it actually says, I think it's Brooklyn bridge.
[00:48:07.140 --> 00:48:11.500]   It's like you're on a downtown six train next stop, Brooklyn bridge, uptown.
[00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:12.800]   And you could like ride this cool loop.
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:16.680]   So there's like, there's always these like kind of cool, random, weird things that would
[00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:20.180]   never make an average tourist list.
[00:48:20.180 --> 00:48:22.980]   In San Francisco, there was this thing for anyone who did it.
[00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:23.980]   You'll know exactly what I mean.
[00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:26.620]   Unfortunately, it's closed called the JeJune Institute.
[00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:30.460]   And you like went to this office building and you just like went up to the 30th floor.
[00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:33.900]   You knocked on a door, the door opened, you went into a room and you like watched a weird
[00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:37.220]   video and they like there was an envelope and then you would go on like a scavenger
[00:48:37.220 --> 00:48:38.220]   hunt.
[00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:41.500]   And I'm like, I have no idea how this works, like you put a twenty dollars in a slot, but
[00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:42.500]   there were no people.
[00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:43.500]   It was the weirdest thing.
[00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:46.580]   It was like it wasn't an escape room because there was no escaping, but it kind of had
[00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:49.500]   that vibe and it was the coolest thing ever.
[00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:51.380]   But no, not on any tourist guide.
[00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:56.300]   So any of those kind of like cool experiences that you might do on the weekends with friends
[00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:59.940]   that would never really make a guide, maybe it would make one of your guides, but it's
[00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:01.540]   definitely not in the average guide.
[00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:07.060]   OK, so I'll give you two because I'll give you a little one, but then let me give you
[00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:10.860]   like a bit of a bigger one that you can spend an afternoon.
[00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:16.660]   So there is this area in London called Bermondsey and running through Bermondsey because it's
[00:49:16.660 --> 00:49:21.260]   very close to London Bridge Station, which is one of the biggest stations in London.
[00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:24.220]   There are elevated railway tracks.
[00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:29.980]   So and then underneath the railway tracks are businesses that are in the arches.
[00:49:29.980 --> 00:49:35.620]   So because they're small spaces are all very small businesses that are very independent.
[00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:42.440]   And in one specific area of Bermondsey under these arches, it all happens to be breweries
[00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:44.700]   and gin distilleries.
[00:49:44.700 --> 00:49:48.880]   And so this thing has come about where it's like the unofficial name for it is called
[00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:51.060]   the Bermondsey Beer Mile.
[00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:58.340]   And on Saturdays, these breweries open up and they let people come in and have do tastings
[00:49:58.340 --> 00:50:01.500]   or just get a pint or try the gin.
[00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:06.280]   And what people do is they hop around to they make a Saturday of it and they hop around
[00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:11.500]   to all the different distilleries and breweries and try all the different drinks.
[00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:16.020]   And it can get a little bit messy, obviously, depending on how quickly you do it.
[00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:23.380]   You can also pair that with a visit to Maltby Street Market, which is literally right there.
[00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:29.300]   And you can get food and they have really good independent food stall vendors that are
[00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:36.700]   selling like they have probably the most diverse food vendors in of all the markets in London.
[00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:40.180]   So that's like I love doing that Bermondsey Beer Mile.
[00:50:40.180 --> 00:50:41.180]   It's really fun.
[00:50:41.180 --> 00:50:45.780]   And it's I feel like it gets skipped over so much because there's no like there's there's
[00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:47.860]   no official like website for it.
[00:50:47.860 --> 00:50:50.660]   There's someone who's made an unofficial one, but it's pretty easy to find.
[00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:55.960]   You just navigate to Maltby Street Market and then you'll see all of the breweries and
[00:50:55.960 --> 00:50:57.360]   distilleries.
[00:50:57.360 --> 00:50:58.360]   And so that's one of my favorite.
[00:50:58.360 --> 00:51:02.460]   I love recommending that, but I don't think that many people take me up on it, sadly.
[00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:03.460]   But it's almost good, though.
[00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:04.460]   So it's fine.
[00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:08.860]   I don't know if we'll do the full drinking mile, but we will 100% go to food.
[00:51:08.860 --> 00:51:12.500]   So I'm like a sucker for street food, food market, anything like that.
[00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:15.860]   Favorite stall?
[00:51:15.860 --> 00:51:21.060]   I mean, I had an amazing banh mi sandwich that's so Vietnamese.
[00:51:21.060 --> 00:51:22.660]   I don't remember the name of the stall.
[00:51:22.660 --> 00:51:26.180]   They do kind of change them out sometimes, too, which is nice because then everyone can
[00:51:26.180 --> 00:51:27.340]   like try different things.
[00:51:27.340 --> 00:51:30.900]   But I think probably that banh mi is a favorite I've had so far.
[00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:33.620]   And then just for a little fun, a smaller one, too.
[00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:37.380]   So there's we were talking about Shoreditch before, and I mentioned that it's like the
[00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:39.780]   most famous area in London for street art.
[00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:42.620]   So if you want to go street art spotting, you can do that.
[00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:51.060]   A fun little thing you can do while you're doing that is there's a bunch of tiny 3D broccolis
[00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:54.020]   scattered around the Brick Lane area.
[00:51:54.020 --> 00:51:57.940]   So you can go and spot all of the little broccolis.
[00:51:57.940 --> 00:52:04.500]   And the broccolis were put there, I think was about 15 years ago by this artist, Adrian
[00:52:04.500 --> 00:52:05.500]   Boswell.
[00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:08.060]   And he actually has a gallery there and like broccolis are his thing.
[00:52:08.060 --> 00:52:12.700]   So you can end up spotting all the broccolis and then go to his gallery and see what the
[00:52:12.700 --> 00:52:13.700]   deal is in there, too.
[00:52:13.700 --> 00:52:15.020]   So that's kind of a fun thing.
[00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:19.460]   But it's one of those things where I didn't I'd never noticed that.
[00:52:19.460 --> 00:52:23.240]   And then a couple of years ago, somebody pointed it out to me and I was like, oh, my God, that's
[00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:24.240]   so cool.
[00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:27.900]   I've never in all of my research, I've never heard anyone talk about that before.
[00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:31.340]   I feel like my daughter would love a walk around looking for broccoli.
[00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:33.020]   So that was that's a great one.
[00:52:33.020 --> 00:52:34.020]   Perfect.
[00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:35.020]   And they're like colorful.
[00:52:35.020 --> 00:52:36.020]   And so, yeah, they're great.
[00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:37.220]   Great for kids, too.
[00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:38.780]   We're talking about food a lot.
[00:52:38.780 --> 00:52:41.900]   And it just happens to be noon in San Francisco, so I'm already getting hungry.
[00:52:41.900 --> 00:52:46.420]   But I think the reason that we travel is often for food.
[00:52:46.420 --> 00:52:50.260]   And so one of the challenges is it's so easy if you're going to Malaysia, it's like this
[00:52:50.260 --> 00:52:53.740]   is like I know the kind of food I want to go get.
[00:52:53.740 --> 00:52:57.160]   But when I think of London, it's like I've been told the best Indian food in the world
[00:52:57.160 --> 00:52:58.420]   outside of India is in London.
[00:52:58.420 --> 00:53:00.360]   We're like, OK, we got a little list there.
[00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:04.860]   Are there I don't even know how to ask this question, like, where should we be eating?
[00:53:04.860 --> 00:53:06.620]   Like, there's just so many options.
[00:53:06.620 --> 00:53:11.140]   I'm like, are there a couple of things that you're like cuisines or a couple of restaurants?
[00:53:11.140 --> 00:53:13.020]   I'm sure you could have a list of a thousand.
[00:53:13.020 --> 00:53:16.780]   I'm sure the itinerary I was looking at probably has the list of a thousand.
[00:53:16.780 --> 00:53:21.180]   But what are just a few like restaurants that are just must must go to?
[00:53:21.180 --> 00:53:22.380]   They don't have to be the most popular.
[00:53:22.380 --> 00:53:23.820]   They don't have to be the most expensive.
[00:53:23.820 --> 00:53:27.920]   Ideally, they're not the ones that you have to plan two months in advance to get a table.
[00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:31.980]   This is a hard one because it's there's just so many good places.
[00:53:31.980 --> 00:53:36.340]   Also, I think what's interesting about London, in my personal opinion, is that you don't
[00:53:36.340 --> 00:53:42.620]   have to spend a lot of money to have a really, really good food experience.
[00:53:42.620 --> 00:53:48.220]   I actually find that the mid range restaurants are my favorites.
[00:53:48.220 --> 00:53:54.720]   I have many all of my favorites are at the mid range level, not like super luxury.
[00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:56.740]   We did talk about a couple of them that I love already.
[00:53:56.740 --> 00:53:57.780]   So we did the Barbary.
[00:53:57.780 --> 00:54:00.700]   We talked about Bao.
[00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:06.600]   There's an Italian that's called Campania and Jones, and it's in a tiny little place
[00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:11.980]   off of Columbia Road, which this is east London and Columbia Road is quite famous for being
[00:54:11.980 --> 00:54:17.020]   this like very beautiful, picturesque street that has all independent shops on it.
[00:54:17.020 --> 00:54:21.700]   And on Sundays, it has a world famous flower market, which people love to go visit.
[00:54:21.700 --> 00:54:26.780]   You can pick up flowers or you can just walk around and see the chaos that kind of ensues
[00:54:26.780 --> 00:54:27.780]   with it.
[00:54:27.780 --> 00:54:29.220]   It's very fun.
[00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:35.980]   So just off of that is Campania and Jones, and they do regional Italian dishes from Campania,
[00:54:35.980 --> 00:54:36.980]   obviously.
[00:54:36.980 --> 00:54:37.980]   And the food here is amazing.
[00:54:37.980 --> 00:54:38.980]   It is.
[00:54:38.980 --> 00:54:44.300]   It can be tricky to get reservations, but if you can do a weekday and do it like five
[00:54:44.300 --> 00:54:52.060]   o'clock when they open, then or do like a later one, like nine thirty, then it is doable.
[00:54:52.060 --> 00:54:57.620]   And if you if anyone does end up going there, there's a starter that's called nudie and
[00:54:57.620 --> 00:54:58.900]   it comes with sage butter.
[00:54:58.900 --> 00:55:01.740]   And that was it was like one of the best things I've ever had.
[00:55:01.740 --> 00:55:02.740]   It's so nice.
[00:55:02.740 --> 00:55:04.380]   It's really good.
[00:55:04.380 --> 00:55:07.580]   I was with friends and we were eating it and we all just stopped talking, which is a lot
[00:55:07.580 --> 00:55:08.940]   for me and my friends.
[00:55:08.940 --> 00:55:11.700]   So because we're all just like, oh, my God, this is amazing.
[00:55:11.700 --> 00:55:14.260]   It's basically it's kind of like Italian dumplings.
[00:55:14.260 --> 00:55:16.700]   So good.
[00:55:16.700 --> 00:55:18.300]   So I love Indian.
[00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:19.820]   I also love Sri Lankan.
[00:55:19.820 --> 00:55:24.620]   I have been to Sri Lanka before and like my interest just has been peaked and people have
[00:55:24.620 --> 00:55:30.500]   been we have some really good Sri Lankan restaurants here and one that is one of my favorites is
[00:55:30.500 --> 00:55:32.600]   called Paradise and it's right in Soho.
[00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:34.420]   So it's very central London.
[00:55:34.420 --> 00:55:37.740]   It's a modern take on Sri Lankan food.
[00:55:37.740 --> 00:55:40.860]   So they do like really great small dishes.
[00:55:40.860 --> 00:55:45.460]   So you share you just order a bunch of them and everybody shares theirs.
[00:55:45.460 --> 00:55:49.700]   They do this chickpea curry, which is like so good.
[00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:52.180]   And they do amazing cocktails as well.
[00:55:52.180 --> 00:55:53.180]   And this is another one.
[00:55:53.180 --> 00:55:57.180]   I would say for sure you do want to you're going to all the good places you do have to
[00:55:57.180 --> 00:55:58.180]   reserve.
[00:55:58.180 --> 00:55:59.180]   Like that's just kind of how it is.
[00:55:59.180 --> 00:56:05.380]   But I did the other day go there and managed to only a couple days ahead, get a 530 booking
[00:56:05.380 --> 00:56:06.500]   so that for four people.
[00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:07.960]   So it is doable.
[00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:15.660]   Just like do it on on a Monday or Tuesday if you can and go early and that works well.
[00:56:15.660 --> 00:56:18.520]   And then finally, I'm going to give one more Italian and you're going to give one more
[00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:20.740]   Indian because I just want one more Indian.
[00:56:20.740 --> 00:56:21.860]   Let's do it.
[00:56:21.860 --> 00:56:27.460]   So yeah, so Dishoom is like the most popular Indian place in London.
[00:56:27.460 --> 00:56:28.620]   They do.
[00:56:28.620 --> 00:56:31.540]   It's a little bit more of a modern take on Indian.
[00:56:31.540 --> 00:56:34.300]   They've got like four or five locations now.
[00:56:34.300 --> 00:56:39.740]   And obviously, I can't speak to how incredibly authentic it is because I'm not from India,
[00:56:39.740 --> 00:56:45.660]   but it's really popular because they do really, really good food at affordable prices.
[00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:47.260]   The staff are amazing.
[00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:57.140]   And the decor is it's supposed to be kind of like one of a small restaurant that you
[00:56:57.140 --> 00:56:58.580]   might see in Bombay.
[00:56:58.580 --> 00:57:03.820]   So the decor is really interesting and kid friendly works for everyone.
[00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:05.220]   They also actually do.
[00:57:05.220 --> 00:57:07.940]   It's one of my favorite places to go for breakfast.
[00:57:07.940 --> 00:57:09.500]   Oh, yeah.
[00:57:09.500 --> 00:57:10.500]   They do really good.
[00:57:10.500 --> 00:57:15.440]   I've been to India, so I've had Indian breakfast, but I don't know if I've had like a westernized
[00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:17.400]   version of an Indian breakfast.
[00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:19.620]   It's definitely it's a it's a British version.
[00:57:19.620 --> 00:57:27.140]   They kind of like combine Indian food with what would be considered like a British breakfast.
[00:57:27.140 --> 00:57:28.180]   But it's really good.
[00:57:28.180 --> 00:57:34.220]   And that's also if you struggle to get in because they don't really take reservations
[00:57:34.220 --> 00:57:37.100]   at most of the locations, especially for dinner.
[00:57:37.100 --> 00:57:41.660]   So either try to reserve for lunch or go for breakfast if you can't get for lunch either
[00:57:41.660 --> 00:57:47.740]   there, but some of the locations, they have really long lines and people wait like an
[00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:48.740]   hour and a half.
[00:57:48.740 --> 00:57:53.660]   I don't really think you should do that for anything, in my opinion, but there's ways
[00:57:53.660 --> 00:57:54.660]   we can get around that.
[00:57:54.660 --> 00:57:59.520]   So try to reserve at lunchtime, go during the week at lunchtime or go for breakfast.
[00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:04.580]   And what about like our walk ins a thing like in a lot of Japan, it's like, no, we fully
[00:58:04.580 --> 00:58:05.580]   book our tables.
[00:58:05.580 --> 00:58:07.260]   You can't necessarily walk in.
[00:58:07.260 --> 00:58:10.780]   What about for us who have two young kids and like eating dinner at five o'clock is
[00:58:10.780 --> 00:58:12.100]   the norm?
[00:58:12.100 --> 00:58:13.100]   That's doable.
[00:58:13.100 --> 00:58:14.940]   So we have a really big range.
[00:58:14.940 --> 00:58:17.780]   So some places will be reservations.
[00:58:17.780 --> 00:58:19.580]   And if they're booked up, they're booked up.
[00:58:19.580 --> 00:58:24.860]   Some places will have a mix of they'll reserve half of it for walk ins and half of it for
[00:58:24.860 --> 00:58:25.980]   reservations.
[00:58:25.980 --> 00:58:28.260]   And then some places are walk ins only.
[00:58:28.260 --> 00:58:32.940]   So it kind of just depends on and for every budget that varies.
[00:58:32.940 --> 00:58:36.100]   So it's not like if it's a budget restaurant, it's always walk in.
[00:58:36.100 --> 00:58:38.940]   They sometimes will do reservations as well.
[00:58:38.940 --> 00:58:42.900]   If you're trying to find something that's like an easy walk in and you're kind of like,
[00:58:42.900 --> 00:58:46.460]   we've had a long day, I don't want to do too much research.
[00:58:46.460 --> 00:58:47.460]   Pizza is really good here.
[00:58:47.460 --> 00:58:52.460]   There's a lot of places that do good Italian pizza for very affordable and that they do
[00:58:52.460 --> 00:58:56.740]   kids menus as well, like there's Pizza Pilgrims and Franco Manca.
[00:58:56.740 --> 00:58:58.340]   Those are two different places.
[00:58:58.340 --> 00:58:59.940]   They're fantastic, really easy.
[00:58:59.940 --> 00:59:02.260]   You'll be able to get in no problem.
[00:59:02.260 --> 00:59:03.260]   And you had one more Italian.
[00:59:03.260 --> 00:59:04.260]   Oh, yes.
[00:59:04.260 --> 00:59:05.340]   So, yeah, I went here last night.
[00:59:05.340 --> 00:59:07.220]   So it's it's fresh on the mind right now.
[00:59:07.220 --> 00:59:09.500]   And it's in the it's in the guides as well.
[00:59:09.500 --> 00:59:10.980]   So you'll see it in there.
[00:59:10.980 --> 00:59:16.340]   So it's called Padella and they do basically simple pasta dishes.
[00:59:16.340 --> 00:59:21.940]   And the word Padella comes from the Italian word that is I forget exactly what the Italian
[00:59:21.940 --> 00:59:28.740]   word is, but it's what you call how they actually make the pasta here, which is they kind of
[00:59:28.740 --> 00:59:33.180]   they make they finish it off in a pan basically.
[00:59:33.180 --> 00:59:37.100]   Very simple, but really, really good and also affordable.
[00:59:37.100 --> 00:59:41.320]   This is a walk in place, which if you go at five thirty, you're golden.
[00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:42.320]   You will be able to get in.
[00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:43.320]   No problem.
[00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:48.240]   Otherwise, people queue up or they have like a queuing system where they can text you when
[00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:50.380]   your table is ready.
[00:59:50.380 --> 00:59:55.680]   If you go to Padella, my recommendations are to start with the burrata and order bread
[00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:59.780]   on the side because the burrata there is so beautiful.
[00:59:59.780 --> 01:00:05.180]   And then I always ordered the cacio e pepe because they it's the best cacio e pepe I've
[01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:06.900]   had in London.
[01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:08.380]   It's not too cheesy.
[01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:11.020]   It's like it's just really nice.
[01:00:11.020 --> 01:00:12.880]   So those are always my recommendations.
[01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:14.240]   And I love going there.
[01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:15.820]   What about just general dining etiquette?
[01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:17.540]   Are meals slow or meals fast?
[01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:21.700]   Is there something you need to know to get the attention of the waitstaff, tipping all
[01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:22.880]   this stuff?
[01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:28.420]   So things are generally a bit slower than say, if we're comparing to the US.
[01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:35.700]   So we are having I won't get into all the reasons, but every place is very understaffed
[01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:36.700]   right now.
[01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:43.140]   So just kind of pack your patience pants when you come, because especially I mean, Chris,
[01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:46.080]   you're coming very soon and it's a very, very busy time of year.
[01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:50.060]   So it's things are just generally slower, but it's probably going to continue like that
[01:00:50.060 --> 01:00:52.620]   for the next year or so.
[01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:56.260]   So patience definitely.
[01:00:56.260 --> 01:01:00.900]   So you probably will have to like ask for the server unless you're in a more high end
[01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:01.900]   place.
[01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:04.500]   But you might have to a few times like raise your hand and be like, can we get some more
[01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:05.500]   water?
[01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:06.500]   Can we get this blah, blah, blah.
[01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:09.780]   And you definitely will have to ask for the bill.
[01:01:09.780 --> 01:01:11.900]   And then do you want me to go through tipping?
[01:01:11.900 --> 01:01:15.100]   Or wherever it applies if beyond restaurants?
[01:01:15.100 --> 01:01:16.100]   Okay, perfect.
[01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:21.580]   So for restaurants in London, generally what happens is you will get the bill and on the
[01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:24.060]   bill, it will say optional service charge.
[01:01:24.060 --> 01:01:28.760]   And that's generally 12 and a half percent that's been added onto your bill.
[01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:33.820]   If you've had really bad service, you can ask for that to be removed.
[01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:39.100]   Generally we people just end up paying it even if they weren't super happy.
[01:01:39.100 --> 01:01:43.580]   But once you've paid that service charge, you don't have to tip anything additional
[01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:44.580]   on top of that.
[01:01:44.580 --> 01:01:48.740]   And that service charge usually gets distributed between front of house and back of house.
[01:01:48.740 --> 01:01:54.220]   So it doesn't only go to your server, it just gets put into the pool and it goes to people
[01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:56.620]   in the kitchen as well.
[01:01:56.620 --> 01:02:01.940]   In terms of tipping for other things, we're not a huge tipping culture here.
[01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:07.100]   If you're at the hotel and your bags have been carried for you, you could tip but you
[01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:09.740]   won't make anyone upset if you don't.
[01:02:09.740 --> 01:02:14.600]   But of course, no one's going to be upset about some extra money.
[01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:19.940]   For taxis and things like that, you can round up to the next pound or if you had someone
[01:02:19.940 --> 01:02:23.100]   who was really great and you had a long journey from the airport or something, you can give
[01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:25.220]   an extra couple of pounds.
[01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:31.460]   But you don't have to -- it's not like extremely expected.
[01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:33.380]   I'm in my very like British mode now.
[01:02:33.380 --> 01:02:34.980]   What else do people usually tip on?
[01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:39.540]   I don't know, you'd get a drink at a bar, you leave a couple bucks.
[01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:40.540]   Oh, yes.
[01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:46.940]   If you go up to the bar and you're ordering yourself, so someone's not come to your table,
[01:02:46.940 --> 01:02:48.620]   then you do not have to tip.
[01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:49.620]   You can.
[01:02:49.620 --> 01:02:52.540]   So sometimes people will leave like a pound coin.
[01:02:52.540 --> 01:02:56.500]   Sometimes a bar will have a jar where you can leave tips.
[01:02:56.500 --> 01:03:01.460]   There's also this thing where you can say, "Oh, can I like buy you one as well?" to the
[01:03:01.460 --> 01:03:07.100]   bartender and then they will basically charge you for another drink and then that money
[01:03:07.100 --> 01:03:11.300]   will go into a pot for everyone at the end of the night.
[01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:14.500]   I think sometimes it's a little bit dodgy if they actually get that.
[01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:18.420]   So if you do want to tip, I would just say, "Leave a pound coin or two," and that's going
[01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:20.140]   to be like the best option.
[01:03:20.140 --> 01:03:22.260]   But you don't -- again, like you don't have to.
[01:03:22.260 --> 01:03:24.260]   I never tip at the bar.
[01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:27.860]   Occasionally, if I've had someone really good, I'll pop something into -- if they have a
[01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:28.860]   tip jar.
[01:03:28.860 --> 01:03:32.900]   But it's definitely for sure not expected at all and there will be no service charge
[01:03:32.900 --> 01:03:35.980]   added on to your bill if you order at the bar.
[01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:39.620]   If you got table service, then service charge will probably be added.
[01:03:39.620 --> 01:03:43.700]   And if it's not, then you can leave around 10% if you'd like.
[01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:47.700]   So while we're on the topic of drinking at a bar, it might not be as relevant to our
[01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:52.100]   trip, but I want to talk a little bit about nightlife because I feel like London is well
[01:03:52.100 --> 01:03:54.300]   known for it.
[01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:57.900]   Let's talk about what people should be doing at night who aren't in the situation we are
[01:03:57.900 --> 01:04:01.340]   with two kids, two and under.
[01:04:01.340 --> 01:04:02.340]   What's nightlife like?
[01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:03.340]   Where should people go?
[01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:04.660]   What should people be doing?
[01:04:04.660 --> 01:04:10.060]   The biggest areas for nightlife in London are generally Soho and Shoreditch.
[01:04:10.060 --> 01:04:13.340]   So Soho is the very center of London.
[01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:14.820]   It's very eclectic.
[01:04:14.820 --> 01:04:19.420]   It's also where the majority of the LGBTQ+ clubs and bars are.
[01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:24.780]   So anyone who's looking for that, Soho is your place for that.
[01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:30.260]   And then Shoreditch is a little bit more artsy-ish kind of, but also very popular for all different
[01:04:30.260 --> 01:04:33.100]   types of people who want to go out.
[01:04:33.100 --> 01:04:37.260]   Both areas have both cheap and cheerful drinking.
[01:04:37.260 --> 01:04:39.300]   That's very like rowdy and crowded.
[01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:44.700]   They've got the cocktail bars, wine bars, and then both also have clubs.
[01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:53.460]   I'm not going to lie, clubs are not really my thing anymore, but I can give a couple
[01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:55.940]   of recommendations off the top of my head.
[01:04:55.940 --> 01:05:00.460]   So in Soho, there's a club called Freedom, which is quite popular.
[01:05:00.460 --> 01:05:04.020]   They've got a pretty like standard upstairs and then down in the basement, they've got
[01:05:04.020 --> 01:05:06.500]   DJs and a dance floor.
[01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:12.420]   And then for Shoreditch, we had a really famous place there that just got shut, but actually
[01:05:12.420 --> 01:05:17.860]   you can just walk around and follow the crowds and hear the music and then you can find places
[01:05:17.860 --> 01:05:18.860]   that way.
[01:05:18.860 --> 01:05:20.760]   So it's pretty easy and yeah.
[01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:23.340]   And then what time do things close?
[01:05:23.340 --> 01:05:25.660]   Does transportation still run?
[01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:32.260]   So okay, transportation generally stops at midnight when we talk about the tube.
[01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:36.580]   If you are out past midnight, there are a couple of options.
[01:05:36.580 --> 01:05:40.260]   There are night buses, so they have an N in front of the number.
[01:05:40.260 --> 01:05:44.460]   And so if you're using City Mapper or Google Maps and you're trying to get back to your
[01:05:44.460 --> 01:05:50.500]   hotel, you might see N87 and that will be a night bus and those run all night.
[01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:56.620]   There are also some night tubes which run all night as well on Friday and Saturday nights.
[01:05:56.620 --> 01:06:00.160]   So again, Google Maps might be like, "Oh, go on this line," and that's because it's
[01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:01.900]   running all night.
[01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:08.140]   Both of those are generally pretty safe options, but also, of course, you can get taxis.
[01:06:08.140 --> 01:06:13.820]   So you can either use Uber or Free Now if you want to call a taxi or if you see a black
[01:06:13.820 --> 01:06:18.540]   cab, which we're quite famous for our black cabs here, and it's got a light on, that means
[01:06:18.540 --> 01:06:21.940]   that it's free and available so you can put your hand out and call it and they'll pull
[01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:23.260]   over and take you.
[01:06:23.260 --> 01:06:27.900]   Do one of those apps also call if you're like, "I want to take the London black cab experience,"
[01:06:27.900 --> 01:06:31.460]   which I've heard actually for kids is easy because you could roll a stroller in and set
[01:06:31.460 --> 01:06:32.460]   it down.
[01:06:32.460 --> 01:06:33.460]   It's not so crazy.
[01:06:33.460 --> 01:06:34.460]   Yeah.
[01:06:34.460 --> 01:06:38.540]   Both Uber and Free Now call black cabs.
[01:06:38.540 --> 01:06:39.540]   I know Uber does.
[01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:41.180]   I'm pretty sure Free Now does.
[01:06:41.180 --> 01:06:43.100]   And yes, I 100% agree.
[01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:47.580]   Also anybody who might be traveling with someone with a wheelchair, the black cabs are the
[01:06:47.580 --> 01:06:50.980]   best option because the seats fold up so they can accommodate wheelchairs.
[01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:56.700]   So wheelchairs, buggies, which is the British term, the strollers, things like that.
[01:06:56.700 --> 01:07:01.060]   Also, if you just have a lot of bags too, they're best for that.
[01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:06.620]   And then in terms of when the actual nightlife closes, so generally, pubs will only stay
[01:07:06.620 --> 01:07:13.580]   open until about 11, 11.30, bars will stay open until about 2, 2.30, and then the clubs,
[01:07:13.580 --> 01:07:17.460]   a lot of them shut at 4, but also a lot of them go a lot later than 4.
[01:07:17.460 --> 01:07:20.740]   So depending on which one you decide to go to.
[01:07:20.740 --> 01:07:25.580]   I can assure you that I am more likely to be waking up at 4 than still awake at 4.
[01:07:25.580 --> 01:07:26.580]   Same.
[01:07:26.580 --> 01:07:28.660]   And while we're on transportation, right?
[01:07:28.660 --> 01:07:29.660]   So that makes sense.
[01:07:29.660 --> 01:07:34.500]   I feel like we're planning on doing a lot more public transit than taxis, I guess.
[01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:37.100]   What about the airport getting in easy?
[01:07:37.100 --> 01:07:38.340]   Any tips there?
[01:07:38.340 --> 01:07:41.100]   We do have six different airports here in London.
[01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:46.340]   Most people who are flying from like the US or just doing like the big long haul flights
[01:07:46.340 --> 01:07:48.980]   will fly probably into Heathrow Airport.
[01:07:48.980 --> 01:07:51.580]   That's our main airport and our biggest one.
[01:07:51.580 --> 01:07:55.860]   That is technically still kind of London, but it's actually not really.
[01:07:55.860 --> 01:08:00.340]   So it is quite far west of the city, but it's very easy to get into central.
[01:08:00.340 --> 01:08:04.300]   Of course, you can take a taxi or an Uber if you want to, but we have lots of really
[01:08:04.300 --> 01:08:10.900]   good public transport options with the main one being well, the main couple being the
[01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:15.620]   Elizabeth Line, which only just launched a few months ago back in May.
[01:08:15.620 --> 01:08:22.700]   And that is basically like a tube line and it can actually get you into Paddington Station.
[01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:24.340]   It can get you into central London.
[01:08:24.340 --> 01:08:28.540]   It also can get you to East London to Liverpool Street Station.
[01:08:28.540 --> 01:08:34.340]   And it only costs £12.70 at the moment, which is great.
[01:08:34.340 --> 01:08:39.860]   There's also the Heathrow Express, which gets into Paddington and it's faster than the Elizabeth
[01:08:39.860 --> 01:08:40.860]   Line.
[01:08:40.860 --> 01:08:47.460]   It only takes about 16 minutes, I think it is, but it's also £25 per adult, although
[01:08:47.460 --> 01:08:52.580]   kids under 16 go free with an adult.
[01:08:52.580 --> 01:08:56.900]   It also doesn't really make sense to take the Heathrow Express because you might not
[01:08:56.900 --> 01:08:58.780]   be staying anywhere near Paddington.
[01:08:58.780 --> 01:09:04.940]   So your best bet really is to use City Mapper or Google Maps and navigate from Heathrow
[01:09:04.940 --> 01:09:09.940]   to your hotel and see which options are saying for you, but also make sure you adjust for
[01:09:09.940 --> 01:09:16.580]   your arrival time, because if it's really early or really late, then the availability
[01:09:16.580 --> 01:09:19.200]   drastically reduces.
[01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:24.380]   So then you might actually get stuck just taking a taxi or a very, very long night bus.
[01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:27.260]   I know the London theatre scene is pretty big.
[01:09:27.260 --> 01:09:30.060]   In New York, my wife and I hit up a lot of Broadway shows.
[01:09:30.060 --> 01:09:32.740]   We did the Rush stuff to get discounts on tickets.
[01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:38.140]   We did all the kind of cool, crazy theatre, immersive stuff like Sleep No More.
[01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:40.780]   Anything stand out in those areas?
[01:09:40.780 --> 01:09:41.980]   Yes.
[01:09:41.980 --> 01:09:49.700]   So we have the people who have done Sleep No More, so Punchdrunk, they recently have
[01:09:49.700 --> 01:09:55.500]   opened a similar to Sleep No More show called The Burnt City here in London, and I just
[01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:57.780]   went last week and it was awesome.
[01:09:57.780 --> 01:10:00.460]   Highly, highly recommend it.
[01:10:00.460 --> 01:10:04.660]   For people who don't know what that is, it's basically, it's like immersive theatre, right?
[01:10:04.660 --> 01:10:10.180]   Where you go into, well, first of all, if you're a viewer, you have to wear a mask.
[01:10:10.180 --> 01:10:12.940]   You always have to keep this like mask on.
[01:10:12.940 --> 01:10:15.420]   And you go into what's like this huge set.
[01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:18.500]   And we don't mean like a COVID mask, we're talking like face masks.
[01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:19.500]   Exactly.
[01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:25.500]   It looks like the scream mask a little bit, but a little not as quite as scary, I think.
[01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:30.140]   And then what you do is you go into what is like basically a massive movie set that has
[01:10:30.140 --> 01:10:36.820]   multiple different rooms and all these different props, and you see live actors that are acting
[01:10:36.820 --> 01:10:38.620]   out different scenarios.
[01:10:38.620 --> 01:10:42.860]   And sometimes they interact, sometimes they split ways, and you follow all of these people
[01:10:42.860 --> 01:10:46.180]   around and follow their stories.
[01:10:46.180 --> 01:10:50.060]   And the details are amazing, like even the smells of the room are different.
[01:10:50.060 --> 01:10:54.820]   Chris, I know I'm preaching to the choir here, you've done all this already, but it was a
[01:10:54.820 --> 01:10:58.300]   really amazing theatrical experience.
[01:10:58.300 --> 01:11:02.020]   So definitely if they're running until April, I think at the moment.
[01:11:02.020 --> 01:11:06.260]   So if you're in London before April, 2023, definitely check that out.
[01:11:06.260 --> 01:11:10.340]   But if you want to do something a little bit more traditional in the London theatre scene,
[01:11:10.340 --> 01:11:15.060]   there is the longest running theatre show of all time here in London, which is called
[01:11:15.060 --> 01:11:19.180]   Agatha Christie's The Mousetrap, and it's been on for 70 years.
[01:11:19.180 --> 01:11:21.120]   So this is the 70 year anniversary.
[01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:25.600]   So it's actually quite special if you end up getting like, I guess it's only a few people
[01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:31.460]   will be able to get there before it's a 71st year, but still, it is like a linchpin of
[01:11:31.460 --> 01:11:33.460]   London theatre.
[01:11:33.460 --> 01:11:41.300]   And it's very kind of old school, and it very much represents British whodunit theatre,
[01:11:41.300 --> 01:11:45.300]   which is a little bit like over the top, but it's really fun.
[01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:47.580]   And it's really cool.
[01:11:47.580 --> 01:11:50.300]   It's just definitely like a very London experience.
[01:11:50.300 --> 01:11:52.940]   So I would highly recommend people get tickets to that.
[01:11:52.940 --> 01:11:55.860]   And you can actually get like 15 pound tickets for that.
[01:11:55.860 --> 01:11:59.720]   Even if you book in advance, if you just go for the really high up seats, but they also
[01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:06.180]   do some last minute deals as well, which you can get through TKTS or it's also called Official
[01:12:06.180 --> 01:12:07.180]   London Theatre.
[01:12:07.180 --> 01:12:08.180]   Wow.
[01:12:08.180 --> 01:12:09.180]   Okay.
[01:12:09.180 --> 01:12:13.220]   I feel like this is a masterclass in London, which was the goal.
[01:12:13.220 --> 01:12:16.660]   We talked, I think, about most of the things people need to plan out in advance.
[01:12:16.660 --> 01:12:20.840]   So I just want to recap, like make your reservations at restaurants if you want to go to hotspots
[01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:23.100]   and you want to eat in prime time.
[01:12:23.100 --> 01:12:28.280]   Any tickets for things that especially during peak season tourist attractions, any other
[01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:31.780]   things that people really need to make sure they figure out before they get there?
[01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:37.260]   Yeah, I think if you're doing peak season, anything that you can book in advance is a
[01:12:37.260 --> 01:12:38.260]   good idea.
[01:12:38.260 --> 01:12:43.840]   Also, ever since COVID, a lot of the major attractions are now having time to entry.
[01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:47.760]   Not all of them stick to it, but they will sell out for a certain time.
[01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:52.360]   So if you've got a pretty strict schedule that you want to stick to, then at least give
[01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:55.700]   yourself a couple of days ahead of time to book the tickets.
[01:12:55.700 --> 01:12:59.780]   So you don't have to worry about like, "Oh, well, now we didn't get the time that we wanted.
[01:12:59.780 --> 01:13:05.220]   So we're going to have to run back and do this and do that, blah, blah, blah."
[01:13:05.220 --> 01:13:13.540]   I would say in 2023, anyone who's visiting, tourism has really come back with a vengeance
[01:13:13.540 --> 01:13:20.680]   and we're already seeing availability of hotels really low for even like the end of next year.
[01:13:20.680 --> 01:13:29.020]   So I would definitely recommend anyone coming next year to book hotel as quickly as possible.
[01:13:29.020 --> 01:13:33.660]   You can always do something that you can cancel, but it would just be good to have something
[01:13:33.660 --> 01:13:37.020]   just in case you don't find anything else at the price that you're looking for.
[01:13:37.020 --> 01:13:39.500]   So just get it done, do it in advance.
[01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:44.460]   Any favorites amongst the hotels that fall in that category of like, you might not find
[01:13:44.460 --> 01:13:48.500]   them on the major sites, you might overlook it because it seems like it is this random
[01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:49.500]   property?
[01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:50.500]   Yeah.
[01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:55.420]   So there's one place I really like, again, in East London, it's called Mama Shelter.
[01:13:55.420 --> 01:14:01.180]   And they do, I think it's a Parisian brand because they've got a few places in France.
[01:14:01.180 --> 01:14:02.420]   And LA.
[01:14:02.420 --> 01:14:03.420]   And oh, that's right.
[01:14:03.420 --> 01:14:04.420]   That's the one in LA.
[01:14:04.420 --> 01:14:05.420]   Yeah.
[01:14:05.420 --> 01:14:08.420]   I helped our au pair book a room there like six months ago.
[01:14:08.420 --> 01:14:10.220]   So and she said it was really cool.
[01:14:10.220 --> 01:14:12.420]   Yeah, they've got a really nice rooftop at that one.
[01:14:12.420 --> 01:14:13.740]   It's really nice.
[01:14:13.740 --> 01:14:19.540]   The one here, I think gets overlooked sometimes because it's a little bit out of the way it
[01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:24.580]   is out of the way if you want to do only the main attractions, but it's actually really
[01:14:24.580 --> 01:14:25.580]   well located.
[01:14:25.580 --> 01:14:31.100]   If you want to do some of the more local stuff in East London, for example, it's not far
[01:14:31.100 --> 01:14:35.940]   from Broadway Market, which is this Saturday market that's quite famous now.
[01:14:35.940 --> 01:14:41.360]   Lots of great stalls selling food and jewelry and artisan pieces and things like that.
[01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:45.700]   Also walkable in about 20 minutes to Shoreditch, or there's a bus that will get you there even
[01:14:45.700 --> 01:14:46.700]   quicker.
[01:14:46.700 --> 01:14:53.060]   And it's a good, I would say it's on the higher range of budget hotels, but the staff are
[01:14:53.060 --> 01:14:54.060]   amazing.
[01:14:54.060 --> 01:14:55.060]   It's really colorful.
[01:14:55.060 --> 01:14:56.500]   They do karaoke nights.
[01:14:56.500 --> 01:14:58.540]   They've got a gym there.
[01:14:58.540 --> 01:15:01.060]   You can and if you book in advance, you can get a pretty good deal there.
[01:15:01.060 --> 01:15:06.020]   So that's probably one of my favorite recommendations for hotels.
[01:15:06.020 --> 01:15:10.260]   Anything on the next tier up, like the mid-range?
[01:15:10.260 --> 01:15:12.700]   So I really like the Henrietta Hotel.
[01:15:12.700 --> 01:15:14.220]   Maybe it's more luxury.
[01:15:14.220 --> 01:15:16.180]   The Henrietta Hotel is right in Covent Garden.
[01:15:16.180 --> 01:15:23.580]   It is a small boutique hotel that is French inspired and really beautiful decor.
[01:15:23.580 --> 01:15:25.400]   You can't get any better on the location.
[01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:28.180]   You just walk out the front door, you're in Covent Garden.
[01:15:28.180 --> 01:15:29.520]   It's amazing.
[01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:32.700]   And the rooms are beautiful and they're big and the bathrooms are amazing.
[01:15:32.700 --> 01:15:37.460]   And then I have a really special luxury high-end recommendation.
[01:15:37.460 --> 01:15:41.060]   We talked about the Shangri-La earlier.
[01:15:41.060 --> 01:15:46.140]   That hotel is the highest hotel in London, obviously, because it's in the tallest building
[01:15:46.140 --> 01:15:53.620]   in Western Europe and is super special too, because they have an indoor pool, which is
[01:15:53.620 --> 01:15:58.900]   the highest hotel pool in Western Europe, but probably a lot of other parts of Europe
[01:15:58.900 --> 01:16:00.140]   as well.
[01:16:00.140 --> 01:16:04.640]   So it's got floor-to-ceiling windows, and you're just swimming around, looking down
[01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:07.440]   onto London and across the skyline.
[01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:08.860]   It's a pretty special experience.
[01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:12.260]   So definitely, I recommend that one.
[01:16:12.260 --> 01:16:15.260]   We filmed a video in one of their suites there.
[01:16:15.260 --> 01:16:16.820]   It was the coolest experience.
[01:16:16.820 --> 01:16:17.820]   It was awesome.
[01:16:17.820 --> 01:16:20.620]   There's going to be a lot of links in the show notes to anything you mentioned.
[01:16:20.620 --> 01:16:22.860]   Send me all those links also.
[01:16:22.860 --> 01:16:27.620]   And for anyone who's new and hasn't heard, we have a hotel booking service at All The
[01:16:27.620 --> 01:16:33.580]   Hacks that, for those five-star hotels, can hook you up with usually an upgrade, a property
[01:16:33.580 --> 01:16:37.340]   credit, late check-in, early check-out, free breakfast, all that stuff.
[01:16:37.340 --> 01:16:41.700]   So you just go to allthehacks.com/upgrades, and you can see that.
[01:16:41.700 --> 01:16:43.620]   Also a couple other hotel things.
[01:16:43.620 --> 01:16:45.700]   So one, this is new for me.
[01:16:45.700 --> 01:16:48.060]   Normally, we stay at hotels.
[01:16:48.060 --> 01:16:49.980]   And we're never really the Airbnb type.
[01:16:49.980 --> 01:16:53.580]   And then we started traveling with a family, and we were like, "Okay, we got two adults,
[01:16:53.580 --> 01:16:55.220]   two kids, and an au pair.
[01:16:55.220 --> 01:16:56.340]   We're looking at hotels."
[01:16:56.340 --> 01:17:01.620]   One of the challenges in Europe is that a lot of hotels have capacity limits on rooms.
[01:17:01.620 --> 01:17:07.140]   And so I do know that if you are booking a chain, whether it's Hyatt or Accor or Marriott
[01:17:07.140 --> 01:17:11.420]   or Hilton, I think almost all of them have a program in Europe, including some of the
[01:17:11.420 --> 01:17:14.740]   hotels in London, where you get 50% off the second room.
[01:17:14.740 --> 01:17:16.900]   So definitely inquire.
[01:17:16.900 --> 01:17:17.900]   It's not just if you book two rooms.
[01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:21.700]   But if you book two rooms and your kids are coming, they give you a deal for that second
[01:17:21.700 --> 01:17:23.220]   room.
[01:17:23.220 --> 01:17:25.140]   That's true in a lot of other places.
[01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:31.340]   And then we booked an Airbnb, and I didn't know this, but you can negotiate Airbnbs.
[01:17:31.340 --> 01:17:37.500]   And so we saw a place, we're planning it pretty last minute, and we're like, "Hey, you have
[01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:38.800]   six days free.
[01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:43.060]   We're going to be there for those exact six days you have free.
[01:17:43.060 --> 01:17:44.540]   We're coming in a week.
[01:17:44.540 --> 01:17:48.540]   So your place is a little nicer than some of the places we're looking at, and it's a
[01:17:48.540 --> 01:17:49.540]   little more expensive.
[01:17:49.540 --> 01:17:52.180]   If you could bring it down 25%, we'd book it."
[01:17:52.180 --> 01:17:53.420]   And we did that for London.
[01:17:53.420 --> 01:17:54.740]   We're also going to Paris.
[01:17:54.740 --> 01:17:58.540]   And both places brought the price down about 20%.
[01:17:58.540 --> 01:17:59.540]   And we booked it right away.
[01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:00.840]   And so we were able to save 20%.
[01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:04.860]   So normally, I think the idea of staying at a hotel where you got free breakfast and there's
[01:18:04.860 --> 01:18:07.240]   a lot more things figured out was easier.
[01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:12.260]   But it turns out if you're two adults, two kids in an au pair, we just couldn't find
[01:18:12.260 --> 01:18:16.740]   a hotel setup that worked, especially over the holidays, where we would be able to have
[01:18:16.740 --> 01:18:19.920]   a place that we could hang out while the kids are sleeping in the rooms.
[01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:25.500]   And so I think for the next little bit, it's going to be hard for us, but...
[01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:30.200]   Can I give a recommendation for anyone who is looking for something like that and wants
[01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:32.760]   to do almost like a service department?
[01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:35.920]   I don't even know what that means, but of course you can.
[01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:38.920]   It's basically, it's like an apart hotel, I would say.
[01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:43.920]   So there's this brand here in London called the Cheval Residences.
[01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:44.920]   This is quite...
[01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:47.680]   Actually, you can get pretty good deals there if you book in advance.
[01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:56.200]   So you just have to kind of like play it out, but they've got one property that overlooks
[01:18:56.200 --> 01:19:01.040]   Tower Bridge and they have apartments that do...
[01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:02.040]   You can get like two-bedroom.
[01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:04.100]   I think they have three-bedroom as well.
[01:19:04.100 --> 01:19:10.520]   And they're great with kids because they can provide anything you might need like cribs,
[01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:17.360]   high chairs, they can accommodate stuff if you want to bring your pets.
[01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:19.680]   Anything you basically need, they can give it to you.
[01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:24.960]   And then this place is extra special because if you get one of the Riverside places, you
[01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:28.640]   wake up and you go on your little balcony and overlook Tower Bridge.
[01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:29.640]   It's amazing.
[01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:33.960]   But there, when I have families that are looking for...
[01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:39.600]   Because we kind of, personally for us, we try to dissuade people from Airbnb just because
[01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:41.640]   of the ethical side of it in London.
[01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:44.680]   We're having a really bad housing crisis here.
[01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:47.840]   So I usually try to push people to apart hotels.
[01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:53.680]   And with families who need like the multiple rooms off of the living area, Cheval usually
[01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:55.980]   is like a really good option for that.
[01:19:55.980 --> 01:19:57.180]   And it's really nice.
[01:19:57.180 --> 01:20:02.380]   Well, I apologize for contributing to your London problem.
[01:20:02.380 --> 01:20:03.380]   It's okay.
[01:20:03.380 --> 01:20:04.380]   No, no.
[01:20:04.380 --> 01:20:05.380]   It's okay.
[01:20:05.380 --> 01:20:06.380]   It's a tricky one.
[01:20:06.380 --> 01:20:07.380]   I understand the...
[01:20:07.380 --> 01:20:08.380]   But you guys are...
[01:20:08.380 --> 01:20:10.340]   You're not the only people who have struggled with that.
[01:20:10.340 --> 01:20:15.220]   And that's part of where Airbnb has flourished is for stuff like that.
[01:20:15.220 --> 01:20:18.100]   So it's not to shame you or anything, but we just...
[01:20:18.100 --> 01:20:19.980]   I try to give alternatives.
[01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:23.940]   And on the topic of kids, what's the vibe of bringing your kids around?
[01:20:23.940 --> 01:20:25.260]   People are annoyed by it.
[01:20:25.260 --> 01:20:27.180]   Are they cool?
[01:20:27.180 --> 01:20:28.180]   What should we be thinking?
[01:20:28.180 --> 01:20:30.780]   Can you give my wife breastfeed in public?
[01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:32.620]   I know London's a little conservative.
[01:20:32.620 --> 01:20:34.280]   She can definitely breastfeed in public.
[01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:35.940]   That's totally fine.
[01:20:35.940 --> 01:20:38.940]   I think that...
[01:20:38.940 --> 01:20:43.960]   I don't have kids, so I can't fully speak for families who are going out in the world
[01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:47.300]   all the time in London with children.
[01:20:47.300 --> 01:20:52.940]   Most of the time though, as long as the kids are fairly well-behaved and they're feeling
[01:20:52.940 --> 01:20:58.040]   okay, it's pretty doable, especially during the day.
[01:20:58.040 --> 01:21:00.020]   You can take the kids anywhere during the day.
[01:21:00.020 --> 01:21:05.900]   All restaurants will take them, they'll accommodate them, all of the sites and everything, obviously.
[01:21:05.900 --> 01:21:10.180]   And like we talked about, pubs, you can take the kids to the pubs during the day as well.
[01:21:10.180 --> 01:21:13.940]   So generally, the reception is good.
[01:21:13.940 --> 01:21:18.940]   And I have been told by parent friends that the reception is better in London than New
[01:21:18.940 --> 01:21:21.100]   York and some of the other major cities that they've been in.
[01:21:21.100 --> 01:21:22.100]   All right.
[01:21:22.100 --> 01:21:24.900]   Well, I am incredibly excited for this trip.
[01:21:24.900 --> 01:21:27.920]   I have one last thing before we wrap.
[01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:29.980]   We're not going to put this in the show notes.
[01:21:29.980 --> 01:21:34.780]   You've already given a lot of great recommendations, but is there one best kept secret that you
[01:21:34.780 --> 01:21:37.380]   were like, "I don't really want anyone to know that this restaurant is here.
[01:21:37.380 --> 01:21:38.380]   It's my favorite.
[01:21:38.380 --> 01:21:41.620]   It's not crowded yet," or bar or something that we can leave right at the end of the
[01:21:41.620 --> 01:21:44.260]   episode only for the people that are still here?
[01:21:44.260 --> 01:21:45.260]   Yeah.
[01:21:45.260 --> 01:21:46.260]   Okay.
[01:21:46.260 --> 01:21:55.780]   This is like, there's a cocktail bar that's called Lounge Bohemia, and it is in Shoreditch.
[01:21:55.780 --> 01:21:58.460]   I had passed it a million times.
[01:21:58.460 --> 01:22:01.740]   It's just like a very random door.
[01:22:01.740 --> 01:22:04.140]   I would say it's speakeasy vibes.
[01:22:04.140 --> 01:22:09.060]   I'd pass it a million times over my nine, 10 years here, and someone eventually was
[01:22:09.060 --> 01:22:10.060]   like, "Oh, you've never been there.
[01:22:10.060 --> 01:22:11.060]   You should go try it."
[01:22:11.060 --> 01:22:12.060]   I was like, "Okay."
[01:22:12.060 --> 01:22:18.160]   I randomly went in there one day, and it's this tiny, tiny little basement bar that has
[01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:25.100]   like 10 seats, and they do very experimental cocktails.
[01:22:25.100 --> 01:22:30.640]   Basically the guy who runs it, who ironically does not drink, so his wife tests all the
[01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:39.540]   cocktails for him, but he runs this bar as a tester for the work that he does for corporate
[01:22:39.540 --> 01:22:42.700]   events and things like that.
[01:22:42.700 --> 01:22:48.420]   He gets hired to do these crazy, crazy, huge special events, really high end, but you can
[01:22:48.420 --> 01:22:55.380]   go to Lounge Bohemia, and you can do a tasting menu, and it's, I believe, five different
[01:22:55.380 --> 01:22:59.580]   cocktails that are off the wall.
[01:22:59.580 --> 01:23:06.080]   One of the cocktails I had was, it was called a Canadian Breakfast, and they brought out
[01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:15.780]   this little tray that had a little pan of blueberry pancakes, and then they lit a fire
[01:23:15.780 --> 01:23:22.420]   and cooked the pancakes, and then you mixed up the jam, and that was part of the drink,
[01:23:22.420 --> 01:23:24.260]   and then you put the pancakes in the drink.
[01:23:24.260 --> 01:23:26.220]   It's just crazy stuff like that.
[01:23:26.220 --> 01:23:32.220]   One of the cocktails was called Winnie the Pooh, and it has an actual bee on the side
[01:23:32.220 --> 01:23:38.780]   of it that, I'm vegetarian, so I made sure that no bees were hurt in the making of this
[01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:39.780]   cocktail.
[01:23:39.780 --> 01:23:42.900]   They're residual bees from, I forget what he was, he said it was exactly, that would
[01:23:42.900 --> 01:23:48.300]   have just gone to waste anyway, actually, but it's an actual bee that sits on the side
[01:23:48.300 --> 01:23:51.500]   of the drink, and you can eat it.
[01:23:51.500 --> 01:23:55.620]   It's like off the wall, crazy, crazy stuff.
[01:23:55.620 --> 01:24:02.100]   Because it's so small, you do need to book ahead, but if you're a cocktail connoisseur
[01:24:02.100 --> 01:24:08.300]   who really likes off the wall, crazy stuff, that's the best place to go.
[01:24:08.300 --> 01:24:09.860]   I feel like you just described me.
[01:24:09.860 --> 01:24:12.100]   I love crazy, weird cocktails.
[01:24:12.100 --> 01:24:16.860]   The only twist that would make it hit every mark for me is if it was also a spicy cocktail,
[01:24:16.860 --> 01:24:22.700]   but I'm sure there is one there that meets that criteria.
[01:24:22.700 --> 01:24:28.100]   I've been fortunate to peruse a ton of your content, but where can everyone here go to
[01:24:28.100 --> 01:24:31.980]   plan their next trip and get all the stuff you're putting out?
[01:24:31.980 --> 01:24:35.000]   Everything is under the name Love & London.
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:40.860]   We have over 300 YouTube videos at this point talking about how to take the tube, where
[01:24:40.860 --> 01:24:44.300]   to eat, things like that, mistakes not to make.
[01:24:44.300 --> 01:24:51.340]   We also have a website, we've got Instagram, TikTok, Pinterest, and an email list, so there's
[01:24:51.340 --> 01:24:54.580]   lots of tons of free content.
[01:24:54.580 --> 01:24:58.260]   And then we've got a few of our paid guides like the itineraries that we talked about,
[01:24:58.260 --> 01:25:00.060]   which are all linked on the website.
[01:25:00.060 --> 01:25:03.380]   Also, we do have something for your listeners.
[01:25:03.380 --> 01:25:08.180]   We do have a special discount that can be used in the Love & London shop, which is where
[01:25:08.180 --> 01:25:10.780]   you can buy all of our digital travel guides.
[01:25:10.780 --> 01:25:18.740]   So we will put a little discount code for 10% off the entire shop in the show notes
[01:25:18.740 --> 01:25:21.340]   or we'll put it somewhere.
[01:25:21.340 --> 01:25:25.820]   Yeah, we'll put it in the show notes, and so you can find that and everybody can check
[01:25:25.820 --> 01:25:26.820]   that out.
[01:25:26.820 --> 01:25:27.820]   Thank you.
[01:25:27.820 --> 01:25:28.820]   Cool.
[01:25:28.820 --> 01:25:29.820]   Yeah.
[01:25:29.820 --> 01:25:31.340]   And there's a one-on-one guide that's also free that I'll link to in the show notes,
[01:25:31.340 --> 01:25:33.500]   which was great, like just kind of high-level overview.
[01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:35.540]   So I really appreciate it.
[01:25:35.540 --> 01:25:40.620]   Oh, you did not market one thing that I think is the crown jewel of the content that you
[01:25:40.620 --> 01:25:47.140]   sell is so much of my trip planning is usually done in Google Maps, and we're just really
[01:25:47.140 --> 01:25:51.100]   far behind on this trip because we planned it a week ago.
[01:25:51.100 --> 01:25:53.100]   And in the guide, it was like, "Click here.
[01:25:53.100 --> 01:25:54.100]   Boom.
[01:25:54.100 --> 01:25:55.100]   Here is your Google Map."
[01:25:55.100 --> 01:25:56.100]   And I was like, "What?"
[01:25:56.100 --> 01:26:01.060]   So I now have this like better than I normally would lay out, like with icons of this is
[01:26:01.060 --> 01:26:04.180]   a restaurant, this is a bar, that kind of stuff.
[01:26:04.180 --> 01:26:11.620]   And I think that that is undersold on your website because I think that you could just
[01:26:11.620 --> 01:26:16.100]   sell for maybe even the same price, the Google Map of it.
[01:26:16.100 --> 01:26:20.340]   And so that was my favorite feature is that now I have Google Maps loaded on my phone
[01:26:20.340 --> 01:26:23.580]   where I'm like, "When we're out and about, we know what we're doing and we could find
[01:26:23.580 --> 01:26:24.580]   cool spots."
[01:26:24.580 --> 01:26:26.940]   So thank you for putting those in there.
[01:26:26.940 --> 01:26:28.540]   Make sure everyone else knows about them.
[01:26:28.540 --> 01:26:29.540]   Cool.
[01:26:29.540 --> 01:26:30.540]   Yeah.
[01:26:30.540 --> 01:26:31.540]   No, that was...
[01:26:31.540 --> 01:26:35.260]   I added that because I was like, "I feel like when I get stuff like this, I'm always just
[01:26:35.260 --> 01:26:36.780]   adding it to Google Maps anyway."
[01:26:36.780 --> 01:26:39.980]   So I'm like, "Why don't I just do it for them?"
[01:26:39.980 --> 01:26:40.980]   So it made sense.
[01:26:40.980 --> 01:26:41.980]   Yeah.
[01:26:41.980 --> 01:26:42.980]   Cool.
[01:26:42.980 --> 01:26:43.980]   Thanks.
[01:26:43.980 --> 01:26:44.980]   Thank you for doing that.
[01:26:44.980 --> 01:26:45.980]   And even more, thank you for being here.
[01:26:45.980 --> 01:26:47.940]   I mean, we have a lot of stuff to figure out.
[01:26:47.940 --> 01:26:48.940]   Good.
[01:26:48.940 --> 01:26:49.940]   No, it's great.
[01:26:49.940 --> 01:26:52.580]   Well, you can ask me anything, obviously, and thank you so much for having me.
[01:26:52.580 --> 01:26:53.820]   I appreciate it.
[01:26:53.820 --> 01:26:54.820]   Yeah.
[01:26:54.820 --> 01:26:58.820]   And maybe we'll see if we run into each other next week, and I'll be excited.
[01:26:58.820 --> 01:26:59.340]   Yeah.
