[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040]   Hi, my name is Mary Lynn.
[00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.760]   I'm a wife, mother, and grandmother, and Women's Ministries Coordinator in Seattle, Washington.
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.900]   I've been a ministry partner with Desiring God for 14 years.
[00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:19.860]   You are listening to the Ask Pastor John Podcast with John Piper.
[00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.380]   Thank you, Mary Lynn, for that.
[00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.300]   We're going to chat with her in just a moment.
[00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.300]   But first, today's question comes to us from a listener named Matt, who emailed us this.
[00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.300]   "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.300]   Thank you for taking my question.
[00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.900]   I know you often talk about joy inside of suffering, like Paul did, and that leads me
[00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.180]   to my question.
[00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.900]   In Psalm 30, verse 5, the psalmist says joy is found on the other side of suffering, weeping
[00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.960]   lasts the night, but joy comes with the morning.
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.660]   But Paul's testimony in the New Testament claims that he found joy together with his
[00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.900]   suffering.
[00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.660]   He said this in 2 Corinthians 6, verse 10, talking about being sorrowful, yet always
[00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.440]   rejoicing.
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.220]   So does joy follow suffering, or is there joy inside suffering?
[00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.060]   And did something change in the new covenant?"
[00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:09.880]   My mother was killed in a bus accident in Israel in 1974.
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.820]   I was 28 years old.
[00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:18.340]   My brother-in-law called me and told me that my mother was dead and my father was seriously
[00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.460]   injured and might not make it.
[00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.580]   That's all he knew.
[00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.220]   He would keep me posted.
[00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.460]   I hung up the phone.
[00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.220]   I told Noel what he told me.
[00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:34.900]   I went to the bedroom, knelt down by the bed, and wept for a long time.
[00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:43.860]   And in my weeping, simultaneous, not sequential, I was rejoicing.
[00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:54.020]   The weeping was owing to, of course, the overwhelming pain of sorrow and loss, massive loss, of
[00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.260]   one whom I so, so cherished.
[00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.900]   The joy was, "Thank you that I had such an amazing mom.
[00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.600]   Thank you that you gave her to me for 28 years.
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.940]   Thank you that evidently she didn't suffer very much.
[00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.780]   Thank you that she is in heaven and not in hell.
[00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.780]   Thank you for countless kindnesses she showed me growing up.
[00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.220]   Thank you that my father is still alive.
[00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.580]   Please save him.
[00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.940]   Thank you that I will see her again.
[00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:33.060]   Thank you, Jesus, for dying for us and covering her sin and my sin and his sin.
[00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:42.300]   Every sweet memory that tumbled to my mind made tears flow more and joy taste sweeter.
[00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:50.740]   So beyond any shadow of a doubt in my mind, it is not double talk to say sorrowful yet
[00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:56.740]   always rejoicing, sorrowful yet always in the very sorrow rejoicing.
[00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:57.940]   That's not stupid.
[00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.460]   That's not double talk.
[00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.500]   That's simultaneous reality.
[00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.500]   I've tasted it.
[00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:13.860]   And yet it is just as true that my night of weeping would give way in due time to a tearless
[00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.540]   joy.
[00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:22.140]   That's what I think the psalmist means when he says joy follows sorrow.
[00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:33.540]   There are waves of sorrow and pain and loss that break, big waves that break over the
[00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.380]   unshakable rock of Christian joy.
[00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:48.460]   And these waves submerge the laughter in the surging, feel it, the surging surf of weeping
[00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.540]   that wells up unbidden from your heart.
[00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.540]   But they don't dislodge the rock.
[00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:04.220]   And the waves recede in due time and the rock glistens again in the tearless sunlight.
[00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:11.120]   Now nobody should pay any attention to anything I just said, unless there's some good biblical
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.340]   basis for it.
[00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.140]   Experience doesn't settle things for us.
[00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:21.060]   So let me test what I just described as my experience with some scriptures.
[00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:30.420]   So Psalm 30, verse 5 says, "God's anger is but for a moment, his favor is for a lifetime.
[00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:36.340]   Weeping may tarry for the night, but joy comes with the morning."
[00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:46.340]   And Psalm 126, 5 and 6 says, "Those who sow in tears will reap with shouts of joy.
[00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:53.180]   He who goes out weeping, bearing the seed for sowing, shall come home with shouts of
[00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.860]   joy, bringing his sheaves with him."
[00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:05.140]   So clearly there is an experience of tears followed, followed, so sequence, by shouts
[00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:06.260]   of joy.
[00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:13.660]   And Matt wonders if there's a conflict between this and 2 Corinthians 6.10, which says, "We
[00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.460]   are sorrowful yet always rejoicing."
[00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:27.100]   So tears followed by shouts of joy in the Psalms, sequential, and joy in, always in,
[00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.660]   sorrow in 2 Corinthians, simultaneous.
[00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:38.180]   So Matt wonders if the difference is because one is before Christ, before the new covenant,
[00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:42.260]   he asks, and another comes after Christ, after the work on the cross.
[00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:46.540]   Is that why there's a difference between the Psalms and 2 Corinthians?
[00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.740]   And the answer is no, that's not why.
[00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:55.700]   We know that because the same sequential reality that the Psalms described is experienced in
[00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.300]   the New Testament.
[00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:02.180]   So let's look at a couple of those, because even as we look at the sequence, we find that
[00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:10.800]   even in this sequential description of sorrowful, then joy, there is also joy in the sorrow.
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:17.900]   So let's take John 16, where Jesus says, "Truly, truly, I say to you, you will weep
[00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:25.300]   and lament, you will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will turn into joy."
[00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:31.540]   So that's sequential, because I die and then live again, and then he makes the comparison,
[00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:33.360]   you're going to have joy.
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:39.420]   But here's what he says, "When a woman is giving birth, she has sorrow because her hour
[00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:40.420]   has come."
[00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.580]   This is the analogy he's making.
[00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:50.220]   But when she has delivered the baby, she no longer remembers the anguish for joy that
[00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:52.540]   a human being has been born into the world.
[00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:59.340]   So sorrow in the anguish of labor pains, followed by joy.
[00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:03.440]   Now anguish is not owing to unbelief.
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.740]   The anguish is owing to pain.
[00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:13.280]   Even the season of pain gives way to the baby in the arms and brings a season of tearless
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.620]   joy.
[00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:23.860]   But even in the cries of labor pain, there is what Paul calls the joy of hope.
[00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:29.380]   He says in Romans 12, 12, "Rejoice in hope."
[00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:36.540]   And in Romans 5, 2, he says, "Rejoice in hope of the glory of God."
[00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:40.020]   Not only that, but we rejoice in our sufferings.
[00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:45.560]   So he puts the two right together in verse 2 and verse 3 of Romans 5.
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:51.900]   We rejoice in our sufferings, our labor pains, you might say, because all Christian suffering
[00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:54.140]   is like giving birth.
[00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:59.840]   God makes it bring an eternal weight of glory, he says in 2 Corinthians 4.
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:06.140]   So there is both sequential and simultaneous sorrow and joy.
[00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:11.740]   Paul gives another example of sequential and simultaneous sorrow and joy.
[00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:19.300]   When Christians had died in Thessalonica, Paul wrote in 1 Thessalonians 4, 13, "We
[00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:24.260]   do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, about those who are asleep," that is, those
[00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:32.900]   who have died, "that you may not grieve as others do who have no hope."
[00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:35.220]   So clearly they are grieving.
[00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:39.500]   They're grieving over the loss of the loved one.
[00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:45.140]   But the day will come when those tears no longer flow like that.
[00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:46.500]   That's sequence.
[00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:53.660]   There's the overwhelming grief and loss and weeping, and then the season comes where that's
[00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:54.660]   over.
[00:08:54.660 --> 00:09:03.500]   But even now, until that day of tearlessness, the tears are not like those who have no hope.
[00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:11.420]   And I take that to mean that Paul said in Romans 5, 2, "We rejoice in hope."
[00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:18.700]   The hope of glory does not contradict the tears that are flowing at the very same time
[00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:22.340]   of the joy of hope.
[00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:26.780]   It doesn't even dry the tears, not immediately.
[00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:31.300]   But our joy is unshaken, immovable by the tears.
[00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:42.100]   The rock of joy is submerged in grief, but it is not dislodged, overthrown, or removed.
[00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:49.620]   Here's one other passage that may give the key to how there can be both sequential and
[00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:54.060]   simultaneous experiences of sorrow and joy.
[00:09:54.060 --> 00:10:01.660]   John describes the age to come in Revelation 21, 4 like this, "God will wipe away every
[00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:08.900]   tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor
[00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:15.980]   crying, nor pain any more, for the former things have passed away."
[00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:25.020]   So here he says that there's sorrow-joy sequence between this fallen age and that
[00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:26.580]   perfect age.
[00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:30.880]   Here joy—I mean, here suffering and pain, and there joy.
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:35.560]   This is the age of tears and mourning and crying.
[00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:41.260]   In that age, all tears wiped away, no more crying, no more pain.
[00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:46.820]   But notice, tears are correlated with death.
[00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:51.100]   God will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more.
[00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:57.820]   And crying is correlated with pain, nor crying, nor pain any more.
[00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:05.760]   So I take this to mean that Christian tears and Christian crying are not owing to loss
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:11.740]   of hope, nor owing to the dislodging of unshakable joy.
[00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:18.980]   Rather, tears are owing to death, and crying is owing to pain.
[00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:21.940]   We cry because it hurts.
[00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:27.640]   There's real pain in the world, physical pain, emotional pain, and there's no stopping
[00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:28.920]   the tears, right?
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:29.920]   When they come, they come.
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:33.020]   You don't say, "Oh, I'm not supposed to have these."
[00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:34.300]   No, it hurts.
[00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:39.460]   And hurting and joy are not opposites.
[00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:40.620]   They're not contrary.
[00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:43.100]   They can exist at the same time.
[00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:47.580]   That's what creates the sequential experience of sorrow and joy.
[00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:51.520]   Christian joy doesn't mean we don't feel pain.
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:54.740]   And when we feel it, tears come.
[00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:56.500]   We don't decide for them to come.
[00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.380]   They just come.
[00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:03.740]   And the psalmist is saying, "They will be wiped away."
[00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:11.540]   And Paul is saying, "They may for a season submerge the shining face and laughter of
[00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:19.860]   the boulder of joy in Christ like surging waves do, but they don't dislodge the rock
[00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:20.860]   of joy."
[00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:24.260]   We are sorrowful, yet always rejoicing.
[00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.740]   Yeah, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:28.500]   I appreciate that clarity.
[00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:33.060]   And before we go, today I want you to meet my friend Mary Lynn in Seattle.
[00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:34.860]   She joins us over the phone.
[00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:36.220]   Mary Lynn, thank you for your time today.
[00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:38.840]   You are a gift to the ministry of DG.
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:43.140]   We met in Seattle in March of this year as your city was closing down for the pandemic.
[00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:44.140]   It was surreal.
[00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:45.740]   It was memorable.
[00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:50.460]   It was an unforgettable trip, all made possible by your heroic efforts on the ground to coordinate
[00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:55.340]   some in-person DG events for us so I could teach on technology.
[00:12:55.340 --> 00:13:00.980]   And it only happened because of you and your husband, and DG's own Peter Hedstrom played
[00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:02.380]   a big role in that too.
[00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:05.640]   So it ended up being a pretty amazing trip overall.
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:09.500]   So on the one hand, you roll up your sleeves, you physically serve DG in the Seattle region,
[00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:14.180]   but you're also a ministry partner by financially supporting the ministry.
[00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:15.860]   Mary Lynn, talk to us about why.
[00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:19.180]   Why do you support Desiring God?
[00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:21.060]   We truly love the ministry.
[00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:25.960]   All of Desiring God's resources have been the quintessential for all seasons ministry
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:27.540]   to us.
[00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:31.780]   And I would start by saying if I'm needing a spiritual or emotional pick me up, it doesn't
[00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:36.340]   take long to scroll through and find an article that's going to redirect my thoughts and even
[00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:41.860]   my emotions toward Christ, toward the gospel and eternal things in a way that refreshes
[00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:43.060]   my soul.
[00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:48.620]   And I think I would say in a way that's so far removed from duty rather that really makes
[00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:52.540]   my returning and rest to a faithful Savior a true delight.
[00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:55.720]   And it has simultaneously met the needs of our whole family.
[00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:58.020]   It's been a unifying force, honestly.
[00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:02.180]   We have a family group chat and every one of us five has at one time or another posted
[00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:04.980]   a DG article with a must read written above it.
[00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:08.340]   And it becomes a shared experience as a family, a shared growth.
[00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:11.860]   And when someone close to us has had questions, we look it up on DG.
[00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:17.260]   Or if we've set up a weekly prayer time with friends, we have chosen to listen to sometimes
[00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:22.580]   an hour sermon if we have the time, sometimes just a quicker look at the book or an APJ.
[00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:26.620]   We actually did look at the book for our small group weekly for a year.
[00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:30.780]   And if we're driving in the car with a 15 or 20 minute drive time, we can fit in a quick
[00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:35.300]   listen and honestly, it just changes the whole day or maybe the conversation that we are
[00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:36.300]   having.
[00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:41.700]   But invariably, there's just the perfect thing and I can find something on point and priceless
[00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:43.060]   in about two and a half minutes.
[00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:46.380]   Well, you clearly make good use of DG resources.
[00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:48.300]   I appreciate that.
[00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:52.540]   And that's one way a lot of people can help DG is getting our resources into the hands
[00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:55.140]   of a lot of people in their lives who need them.
[00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:58.540]   Mary Lynn, what would you say to those who are listening right now to the podcast who
[00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:00.780]   are not donors to the ministry?
[00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:05.100]   Maybe they've been blessed by DG resources for years and now they're beginning to realize
[00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:10.860]   the expense of the ministry and are now starting to consider the part that they could play
[00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:15.940]   in helping us make and spread new resources around the world through a gift, even a small
[00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:17.620]   reoccurring monthly gift.
[00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:19.580]   To them, Mary Lynn, what would you say?
[00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:26.060]   I would say one of the greatest blessings you can give yourself is to support Desiring
[00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:27.380]   God Ministries.
[00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:31.860]   I call it the best kept secret, the ministry that for years, it never occurred to me how
[00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:35.860]   my financial input was needed for them to flourish and add to their resources.
[00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:39.300]   And yet I was being given riches from their work almost daily.
[00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:44.260]   And now the more genuinely godly people at Desiring God, I get to know and love.
[00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:49.020]   And the more I hear about their outreach around the world, the more of a joyful privilege
[00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:50.860]   it is to give abundantly.
[00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:53.380]   Thank you, Mary Lynn, for everything you do for the ministry.
[00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:54.460]   It's a lot.
[00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:59.140]   And if you'd like to join Mary Lynn and join us so that we can make more DG resources and
[00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:01.340]   spread them around the globe, you can join us right now.
[00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:04.180]   Go to DesiringGod.org/donate.
[00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:08.140]   That's DesiringGod.org/donate.
[00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:09.140]   We appreciate it.
[00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:10.140]   I'm Tony Reinke.
[00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:11.500]   We'll see you on Monday.
[00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:12.000]   [END]
