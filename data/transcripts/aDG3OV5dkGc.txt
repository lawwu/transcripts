[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.100]   So I recently went on Scott Galloway's podcast Prof G to promote my book, Slow Productivity.
[00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.320]   After that, I began doing more of a deep dive on Scott's work.
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.840]   One of the things I came across was a TED talk he just gave recently.
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.900]   I have it up on the screen for people who are watching instead of just listening.
[00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.760]   There's Scott Galloway on stage at TED.
[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:31.560]   Here's the title of this TED talk, "How the U.S. is Destroying Young People's Future."
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:38.640]   So in this talk, he gives a list of reasons for why the way we have things set up right
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.000]   now in the U.S. is really bad for young people.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.400]   A lot of it's economic.
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.680]   I'll put some of these charts up on the screen.
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.620]   All right, let's see here.
[00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.380]   You know, there's various charts on the screen.
[00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.600]   You can see it if you're watching.
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.420]   A lot of it's economic policy, economic policy that more benefits, let's say, like baby boomers
[00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.420]   than it does youth.
[00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.420]   But he did mention technology.
[00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.940]   So near the end of the talk, he said technology is also part of how we're sort of screwing
[00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:04.940]   young people.
[00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:10.220]   And in particular, he talked about social media and the way that it is hurting young
[00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.240]   people, especially their mental health, citing a lot of the work that John Haidt has in his
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.700]   new book, "The Anxious Generation."
[00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.620]   All right, so this got me thinking.
[00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:24.540]   I mean, I agree with Scott and John Haidt that, yes, social media is a problem for young
[00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.540]   people.
[00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.140]   It is going to affect their mental health.
[00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.980]   But I think the story of how technology might be destabilizing young people's future is
[00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.660]   larger and more interesting than just that.
[00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.920]   And in particular, what I want to argue in today's deep dive is that there are multiple
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.660]   realities about our current technological future that are going to sort of screw the
[00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.900]   current young generation in terms of their economic professional future in the decades
[00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:52.900]   ahead.
[00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.820]   So I have three things I want to mention that weren't mentioned in Scott's talk where technology
[00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:03.640]   is setting up young people for professional failure in their 20s and into their 30s.
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.940]   And then I'll talk about for each of those at the end, a couple of things that you might
[00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.340]   be able to do to help counteract some of these forces right now.
[00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.180]   All right, let's get started.
[00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.300]   What's the first issue here that hasn't been mentioned yet?
[00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:24.900]   The idea of treating our phones like a constant companion has an economic ramification for
[00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:25.900]   young people.
[00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:26.900]   All right.
[00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:27.900]   Let me tell you what I mean here.
[00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:28.900]   First, let me quantify what I mean by this.
[00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.540]   I'm going to bring up on the screen here a 2023 report from Common Sense Media.
[00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.720]   It's about young people and phones.
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.720]   The report is called Constant Companion, a week in the life of a young person's smartphone
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:42.720]   use.
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.320]   I'm going to take some credit.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.680]   This idea of constant companion as a term to describe our relationship with phones is
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.200]   something I introduced in the pages of the New York Times back in 2019.
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.880]   I wrote an op-ed about the problem with the constant companion model of smartphones and
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.200]   also in my book, Digital Minimalism.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.560]   So I'll take credit for that.
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.640]   There's a chart in here I want to pull up in particular.
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.240]   Let's quantify what we mean by using a phone like a constant companion.
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:12.320]   So what's on the right here on this chart is a figure that's labeled average daily smartphone
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:20.280]   pickups by participant age, the number of times you pick up your phone during a day.
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.200]   There's three bands for each of these frequencies for different ages.
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.720]   Let's look at the dark green band.
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.920]   That's going to be 16 and 17-year-olds, so sort of the teenagers in this study.
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.960]   What we'll see is for the top two groups here, which are the smallest number of pickups,
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.720]   zero to 25 pickups a day, 26 to 50 pickups a day.
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.360]   These have the smallest shares of 16 and 17-year-olds.
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.640]   So they're least likely, the least likely number of times you're going to see one of
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.160]   these teenagers in this study pick up a phone are the smaller numbers.
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:57.720]   What's the most common number of pickups you're going to see with teenagers in this study?
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:04.440]   51 to 100 times, followed very closely by 101 to 150 times, followed closely behind
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.680]   that with 151 to 200 times.
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:15.440]   So somewhere between 50 to 200 times is where the bulk of the survey responses fell.
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.280]   When they did the math over all the age groups, it averaged out to about 100 times a day you're
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.440]   picking up your phone.
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.640]   That's the constant companion model of using your smartphone.
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:28.280]   And it's different than, of course, the ways the smartphone was originally introduced,
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.520]   the tool it was originally introduced as.
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.260]   It was not introduced as a tool to be your constant companion, but something you use
[00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:44.040]   to make calls and listen to audio content integrated into a really nice unified package.
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.200]   As I've written before, Steve Jobs never meant for the smartphone to be something we looked
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.300]   at 100 times a day, but that's what it became.
[00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.160]   This was driven mainly by mobile, the mobile social media revolution.
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:01.160]   It's once the social media companies turned their goals as they were heading towards IPO
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:06.000]   to getting engagement minutes up as opposed to just getting subscriber numbers up.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.280]   That's when they began engineering mobile versions of their experience that were meant
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.960]   to pull you back to your phone.
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.520]   This retrained us in general to look at our phones all the time.
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.960]   So why is this a problem for the professional future of the young people who are growing
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.040]   up right now with the constant companion model?
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.280]   There's two impacts that are relevant.
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:32.220]   One is that it prevents the robust development of your ability to focus.
[00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:37.200]   If you're looking at a phone on average 100 times a day, you are going to have very few
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.400]   moments in which you are actually sustaining concentration on something difficult for an
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:47.440]   expanded period of time without some sort of cognitive relief by looking at distraction.
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.520]   Now as I write about in my book, Deep Work, this is a problem because it's actually in
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.760]   that sustained concentration that important things happen, especially in the knowledge
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:56.760]   economy.
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.940]   Important things such as learning hard new skills quickly and producing really high quality
[00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.420]   results in reasonable amounts of time.
[00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:08.980]   If you do not develop that focus muscle because you have no experience with just keeping your
[00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:15.960]   focus on one thing without cognitive relief, this is a real hindrance to your professional
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.080]   development.
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.320]   So for someone like me or who's older than me, we went through a childhood, we went through
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:28.080]   college years, we went through our early young adult years without a constant companion phones.
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.680]   I graduated college in 2004.
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.640]   The constant companion model didn't really take off until the 2010s.
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.640]   So I was able to develop and practice an ability to focus.
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:43.320]   I didn't have this handicap in the way that the current young generation does.
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:48.720]   That's going to give my generation or above a real cognitive advantage over our younger
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:53.480]   peers because we're more comfortable locking in, learning something hard, producing something
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.880]   difficult.
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:01.040]   The other, this is subtle, but the other problem of the constant companion model on the professional
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:07.320]   future of current young people is that it creates what I called in my book Digital Minimalism
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:08.680]   Solitude Deprivation.
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:12.660]   We have to be really careful about how we define this term.
[00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:19.240]   In my book, I use a definition of solitude that is common and I think is important, which
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:24.880]   means time free from inputs from other minds.
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:29.240]   So in this definition of solitude, it's not about physical isolation.
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.360]   It's about being alone with your own thoughts.
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:36.360]   You're observing the world around you and you're thinking about stuff in your own head.
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.200]   You're not listening or reading someone else's thoughts.
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:44.200]   The constant companion model of the smartphone made it possible for the first time in human
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:47.760]   history to essentially banish all solitude.
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:52.280]   All of the moments where historically, by historically, Jesse, I'm talking about, you
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.440]   know, when we were in college.
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:58.280]   I'm kind of upset that that's now historic, but in this context, it kind of is.
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:04.080]   Historically, when Jesse and I were in college, you know, we had to take the wagon to pick
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:09.180]   up our togas or get our horses from the horseshoe place.
[00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:13.840]   You had solitude all the time because you would just be in line somewhere.
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.720]   You would be walking across campus.
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.760]   You would be waiting for a lecture to begin.
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.540]   You got there a little bit early.
[00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:21.120]   And what would you do in this time?
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.120]   It's you and your own thoughts.
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.120]   You're looking around.
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.120]   You're thinking about things.
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.120]   All right.
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:28.880]   As I argued in Digital Minimalism, solitude is very important, especially for young people,
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:32.880]   because it's where you make sense of your life.
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:33.880]   Solitude is thinking.
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:37.280]   Being alone with your own thoughts is where you integrate your experiences and feelings
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:41.320]   with your growing schema for understanding your life, your position in the world, and
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.120]   the trajectory that you're going on.
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:49.120]   You literally, maybe not literally, I guess you psychologically, I should say, you psychologically
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:54.920]   develop your adult identity through reflection and time spent alone with your own thoughts,
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:59.120]   especially when you're young and so much is changing and so much input is new.
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:02.580]   You got to sit there and make sense of it.
[00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:05.680]   This is really important for your professional future.
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:11.800]   This is how you put on, triumphorize, polish off, and convince yourself this is right,
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:15.620]   your sense of adult identity, which you need to succeed professionally.
[00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:25.080]   You have to come out of this social psychological cocoon to grow into a professional butterfly.
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.960]   You have to do a lot of work inside.
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:28.960]   This is who I am.
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:30.180]   This is different than how I was before.
[00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:32.240]   This is kind of scary, but this is OK.
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.360]   Here's how I fit into this world.
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:34.480]   Here's what's important to me.
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.800]   You need time alone with your own thoughts to do that.
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:41.600]   When you don't get that, what you're going to experience is more of a sense of an arrested
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:46.180]   development, especially with people in their 20s going to their 30s.
[00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:49.840]   You get terminology like adulting becomes more common.
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:10:19.240]   That's a direct reflection.
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:30.480]   It gives you more of a comfort and confidence with navigating the professional world, taking
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:35.160]   on responsibilities, stretching yourself, dealing with difficulties and hardships that
[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.680]   occur in work and how you're going to navigate that.
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:40.320]   It's how you gather the respect of other people.
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:46.880]   It is how traditionally we become leaders as opposed to being in our childhood phase
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:47.880]   followers.
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:51.920]   So a lot of this gets impeded if we don't have time alone with our own thoughts.
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:57.560]   I know it's a subtle thing, but its ramifications aren't.
[00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:02.160]   The constant companion model of the phone, which didn't affect us or anyone older during
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:07.480]   our developmental years, is going to have a professional impact on young people.
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:17.040]   Issue number two, I think of this as the influencer culture tax, by which I mean there's a tax
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:23.400]   that is levied on individuals who grew up in this age of social media and social media
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:24.400]   influence.
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:29.400]   And I don't mean by influencer culture just this idea of there being very professional
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:31.760]   social media users who are influencers.
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:37.000]   I mean the whole culture that this engenders, which is a culture that says you have to see
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.800]   yourself as a mini influencer.
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:45.680]   Even if this is not your job, you need to cultivate a following online.
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:49.440]   It could be small, but it could be your friends and some random people, but you got to think
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:56.360]   a lot about this online persona, what you stand for, what you don't stand for, being
[00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:01.480]   interesting, producing content, tending to your followers, carefully monitoring to make
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:07.240]   sure that you haven't transgressed some sort of implicit Overton boundary that's specific
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.240]   to your particular online tribal cohesion.
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.240]   This uses a lot of time, attention, and energy.
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:14.880]   Here's the problem.
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:18.800]   It's exactly the flavor of time, attention, and energy that you would have otherwise been
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:25.640]   putting into developing your status within your real world professional context.
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:30.960]   So it's subverting this influencer culture is subverting the instinct we have as humans
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:37.720]   to monitor like the communities in which we exist in to try to emerge as a trusted authority
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:42.720]   or leader in those communities to help manage our social standing in the communities.
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:48.680]   This is exactly the energy you have to expend to begin to develop professionally.
[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:53.420]   This is traditionally the energy we would expend to think about my actual communities
[00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:57.080]   that I'm involved in, including my professional communities.
[00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.080]   What's going on here?
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:59.080]   I want to read the room.
[00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:00.160]   I want to understand the different points of view.
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.680]   I want to emerge as a leader in here.
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:08.020]   This is a really important thing we do, a really important drive that humans have.
[00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:14.440]   It's a really important drive for getting ahead in business, in your job.
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:18.340]   And the social media influence culture is subverting that energy over there.
[00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:23.300]   It's a fake online world where what everyone is really doing is just clocking in into their
[00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:27.100]   data factory on behalf of Mark Zuckerberg so that his stock price can go up.
[00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:30.300]   So when you put all of your energy about how do I become a trusted member of the community
[00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:36.620]   and leader to these sort of fake online worlds, it doesn't get expended in the real worlds
[00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:40.780]   where you actually have a job and where you're really dealing with these people.
[00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:43.560]   And we're putting in an intense amount of energy to become a leader in that community
[00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:47.940]   would have really big economic benefits for you.
[00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:52.140]   So we don't talk about this one as much, but I think it matters.
[00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:53.140]   I think it matters.
[00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:55.060]   We're subverting a drive that we really should be.
[00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:58.820]   If you're young in your 20s, you should be putting a lot of that energy to how do I get
[00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:03.280]   a lot of followers at the nonprofit where I work?
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:08.740]   How do I get a lot of likes in the department I work for this large company?
[00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:12.500]   So that energy is being subverted for the benefit of a small number of people who own
[00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:15.340]   shares in these companies and away from your economic future.
[00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:16.660]   All right.
[00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:22.060]   The final issue that I think is disproportionately technology driven, that's disproportionately
[00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:28.540]   impacting the economic and professional future of young people is this rise of pseudo productivity.
[00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:32.380]   So of course, it's one of the big ideas of my new book, Slow Productivity, that knowledge
[00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:38.500]   work is built on this idea of pseudo productivity, which says visible activity is going to be
[00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:41.220]   our proxy for useful effort.
[00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:47.540]   And as I argue in the book, when that combined with the front office IT revolution, email,
[00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:52.580]   Slack, personal computers, mobile computing, it's supercharged this idea of performative
[00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:53.700]   busyness.
[00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:59.220]   It's supercharged the experience of knowledge work as this sort of frantic, fine granularity
[00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:02.260]   demonstration that you're constantly doing things, lots of emails back and forth saying
[00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:06.300]   yes to a lot more projects, constantly having all this administrative overhead.
[00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:11.980]   It's productivity as activity, making those two things synonymous.
[00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:15.380]   Pseudo productivity had been around for a long time, but it was in the 2000s, especially
[00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:21.660]   the 2010s that it really took off as technology tools really amplified it.
[00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:25.520]   This disproportionately hits young people, right?
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:27.500]   Because what does pseudo productivity do?
[00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:32.380]   Well, by forcing you just to be busy all the time, showing activity all the time, you're
[00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:36.140]   not able to do the slow development of new skills that are going to be valuable.
[00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:40.580]   What I call in my book, So Good They Can't Ignore You, career capital development.
[00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:47.340]   Now, if you're in your 40s like I am, you've already built up a lot of skills.
[00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:51.740]   That's what we're doing in our 20s and we were getting better at things, et cetera.
[00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:56.260]   Pseudo productivity is not so bad because it gives me a little bit more flexibility.
[00:15:56.260 --> 00:16:00.940]   I can step off of the cognitive difficulties of building new skills and being held accountable
[00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:05.780]   for what I produce and just, "Hey, if I want to spend the next five or six years just jumping
[00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:08.380]   on a lot of calls and being in meetings and whatever, that's fine."
[00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:11.180]   It gives me a little bit of breathing room, but it stings for the young people because
[00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:14.980]   they're never actually building the skills that are going to give them security.
[00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:20.660]   You put a 23-year-old in a technology hypercharged pseudo productivity environment, they can
[00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:23.220]   play that game well because they don't have other obligations.
[00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:24.220]   They have a lot of energy.
[00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:28.260]   They can stay up late just doing emails and responding to things, but they're not building
[00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:32.980]   up the career capital, the hardware and valuable skills on which ultimately you need to take
[00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:35.500]   leverage over your career.
[00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:40.740]   Pseudo productivity frustrates people of my age because we're like, "This is not real
[00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:45.420]   work and it's frustrating," but it can be a major obstacle, more than just frustrating,
[00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:49.700]   but a major obstacle to professional development for young people because they're not getting
[00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:54.500]   the chance that other generations had to do the hard, deliberate practice of building
[00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:57.020]   up new skills.
[00:16:57.020 --> 00:17:02.380]   All three of these things, we have the constant companion model of smartphones, we have the
[00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:07.860]   influencer culture subverting our instinct towards leadership, and we have pseudo productivity
[00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:11.060]   blocking us from actually building up skills that we can use as leverage.
[00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:14.180]   All three of these things, I think, they're all related to technology.
[00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:19.820]   They're all three presenting obstacles to young people's professional future, especially
[00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:22.700]   when we're talking about knowledge work.
[00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:24.700]   There's stuff we can do about this.
[00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:25.860]   I'll give a couple of quick examples.
[00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:28.380]   Maybe I'll give an example or two for each of these three things.
[00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:31.020]   All right, so the constant companion model.
[00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:34.860]   If you're young and you want to push back about that, begin to think about concentration
[00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:38.860]   like a muscle that you have to develop and you need to put in the time to develop it.
[00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:45.860]   I get into a lot of this in my book, Deep Work, but you need to be practicing focusing.
[00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:50.780]   You need to be very careful when you're working to block time that's non-distracted working
[00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:52.820]   versus time where you're doing more distracting things.
[00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:56.660]   In the non-distracting time, I'm working on one thing and it feels uncomfortable, but
[00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:57.660]   that's okay.
[00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:01.500]   I keep going because, you know what, the bench press feels uncomfortable, but if you do it
[00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:03.900]   long enough, your muscles get bigger.
[00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:08.620]   You have to adopt the mindset of focus is something I have to train and we live in a
[00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:14.140]   world of cognitive junk food, so I have to be pretty intentional about doing that training
[00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:18.980]   because otherwise the default is I'm going to fall out of proverbial shape here.
[00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:21.700]   You also need to prioritize solitude.
[00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:25.980]   That is time alone with your own thoughts, which is going to mean do things without your
[00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:27.220]   phone on a semi-regular basis.
[00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:31.060]   You just get comfortable with like, I went for a hike, I went for a walk, I went on some
[00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:32.380]   errands without my phones.
[00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:37.220]   I'm not not having my phone all the time, but on a regular basis, I'm alone with my
[00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:38.220]   own thoughts.
[00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:40.740]   So you get used to solitude.
[00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:45.660]   Journaling can help with this as well because journaling helps jumpstart this idea of self-reflection
[00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:46.660]   with your own thoughts.
[00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:47.660]   Okay.
[00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:48.660]   Let me try to make sense of these thoughts.
[00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:50.740]   If you journal enough, you get pretty good at this.
[00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:54.540]   And even when you're just waiting on the train or you're going on an errand, you're able
[00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:58.460]   to more with more facility, think about things that happened to you and make better sense
[00:18:58.460 --> 00:18:59.460]   of your life.
[00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:04.980]   So time alone with your own thoughts plus journaling is just trying to claw back in
[00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:08.500]   this sort of self-reflective solitude into your life.
[00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:10.940]   The pushback on the influencer tax.
[00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:17.620]   If you don't get paid to be saying things online, stop posting things online.
[00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:20.780]   We won't get into like consuming social media right now and some of the questions we'll
[00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:21.780]   get into that fine.
[00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:25.100]   You want to consume social media for this professional, this question of professional
[00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:26.100]   development.
[00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:30.660]   Let's not put, let's put that aside, but don't post things.
[00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:34.100]   That's a simple change, but when you're not posting things, you're not commenting, you're
[00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:35.500]   not putting things up.
[00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:40.820]   It removes this, this idea that you have this important audience that you have to tend to
[00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:43.220]   and that cares what you're doing and it needs a lot of your attention.
[00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:47.460]   And when you remove that idea, you're still going to have that impulse because you're
[00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:51.420]   young and you're becoming an adult and we're a social species, you'll still have that impulse.
[00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:56.300]   And when it does not have managing this sort of simulacrum of a community that the online
[00:19:56.300 --> 00:20:00.540]   world gives you, you will seek other places for this impulse to be fulfilled and that's
[00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:04.060]   going to become potentially your working world.
[00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:06.460]   So just don't post things.
[00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:07.900]   You're not an influencer.
[00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:09.120]   Don't think about your audience.
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:12.620]   Your audience is the people that actually you work with day to day.
[00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:14.700]   Your audience is the people that write paychecks for you.
[00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:18.300]   Your audience is the clients that actually forward you money because of the services
[00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:19.340]   you're giving them.
[00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:24.260]   Put that energy into making that audience happy, not this fake audience that was been
[00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:27.940]   constructed by these social media companies to play exactly on those instincts just to
[00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:31.940]   get you to look at a glowing piece of glass longer each day.
[00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:35.700]   And finally, when it comes to pseudo productivity, well, you have to resist it.
[00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:37.700]   And look, I just wrote a whole book about this.
[00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:44.380]   My book Slow Productivity is in detail how you systematically rebuild the notion of productivity
[00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:48.340]   in your job so that you don't get trapped with pseudo productivity and yet you also
[00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:52.240]   are able to succeed with these changes without annoying everyone in your orbit.
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.240]   It's a complicated thing.
[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:57.660]   We talk about it a lot on the show, but let's just set the intention.
[00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:00.100]   Busyness is not usefulness.
[00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:02.580]   Productivity is not synonymous with activity.
[00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:06.900]   It's what did I produce that matters and probably the simplest mindset shift you can make is
[00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:11.140]   starting to ask your question, what did I produce this year and what did I produce during
[00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:15.200]   this last quarter that I'm proud of?
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:17.140]   Write those things down.
[00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:19.000]   That's the list you want to grow.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   Everything else will come from there.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.220]   You say, I want at the end of the year, point back to things I did I'm proud of.
[00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:26.980]   And then you ask yourself in the moment, what am I doing today so that that list I'm going
[00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:29.100]   to be more impressed by?
[00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:34.900]   Suddenly the, I got through my inbox quickly and squeezed in seven zoom meetings is going
[00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:39.900]   to seem as sort of nihilistically absurd as it really is because none of that is directly
[00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:41.580]   connected to producing the stuff you're proud of.
[00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:44.740]   Again, there's a lot, we talk all the time on the show about specifically how to escape
[00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:49.500]   pseudoproductivity, but you got to start by just recognizing pseudoproductivity is not
[00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:51.020]   the game you're playing.
[00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:54.500]   If you're playing the pseudoproductivity game in your twenties, you'll do well at it in
[00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:57.920]   your twenties because you have energy and you're on your phone all the time anyways,
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:02.260]   but then you'll get to your thirties and forties and realize all of these points I was racking
[00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:05.820]   up in these games aren't actually worth much.
[00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:09.340]   Now that I'm want leverage and control over my career, I want stability.
[00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:10.860]   I want to do something new or bold.
[00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:14.940]   You say, Oh, the game I should have been playing is building up skills that matter.
[00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:15.940]   And that's a different game.
[00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:18.620]   So just recognize that's not the game.
[00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:23.060]   And so starting to look at metrics that aren't just busyness in the moment is a one thing
[00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:24.980]   you can do to make that change.
[00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:26.260]   All right.
[00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:28.960]   So that's my addendum to Scott Galloway's talk.
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:32.860]   Technology has all sorts of subtle ways that it's undermining young people's professional
[00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:33.860]   future.
[00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:38.100]   Those are three, not exhaustive, but three particular ways and some advice in there that
[00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:41.020]   hopefully will help you think better about that.
[00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:42.020]   All right.
[00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:47.460]   I think about it, Jesse, if the people that get caught up in managing their social media
[00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:53.300]   audience that aren't like professional influencers, that same energy put into your day job would
[00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:54.300]   make a huge difference.
[00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:56.900]   I like that advice that not do it if you don't get paid.
[00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:57.900]   Yeah.
[00:22:57.900 --> 00:22:58.900]   Don't post if you're not getting paid.
[00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:03.660]   I mean, look, we can get the same effect and save you some money.
[00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:06.700]   Just send a check to Mark Zuckerberg once a month.
[00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:07.700]   Same idea.
[00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:09.060]   But then it's quicker.
[00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:10.060]   It's more efficient.
[00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:12.780]   Just send them a check, right?
[00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:15.100]   And get an applause machine.
[00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:18.740]   Send Mark Zuckerberg a check and then just like a few times throughout the day, just
[00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:23.660]   look out in the space and say a clever quip and press the applause machine button.
[00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:24.660]   People love me.
[00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:25.660]   You really love me.
[00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:26.660]   And then send your check to Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:32.100]   It gets you the same effect, but saves that energy now for actually getting a better paycheck.
[00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:33.100]   All right.
[00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:34.100]   Let's do some ads.
[00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:40.340]   So I want to talk about our longtime friends at Element, L-M-N-T.
[00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:42.400]   You've heard me talk about Element for a long time.
[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:48.260]   When I talk about their electrolyte drink mix that has the right amount of electrolytes
[00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:53.420]   you need to rehydrate after you've been out there exercising or doing a long day of book
[00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:57.940]   touring or lecturing or being at a conference all day, but it has none of the junk in it.
[00:23:57.940 --> 00:23:58.940]   It doesn't have sugar.
[00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:01.380]   It doesn't have weird ingredients.
[00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:03.100]   I do use Element all the time.
[00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:04.380]   After I work out, I use it.
[00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:08.660]   If I'm really dehydrated in the morning, I use it, especially after a long day of teaching
[00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:09.660]   or podcasting.
[00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:12.020]   It's how I rehydrate.
[00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:14.860]   So I am a big Element fan, have been for a long time.
[00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:19.660]   I wanted to mention though, they have this interesting new product, Element Sparkling,
[00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:27.560]   a 16 ounce can of sparkling water that includes their zero sugar electrolyte formulation that
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:29.980]   you already know from their drink mix packs.
[00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:31.540]   I'm very excited about this.
[00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:37.700]   Now here's the thing, Element Sparkling is not yet available just to the general public,
[00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:41.740]   but it is available to Element Insiders.
[00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:46.460]   So if you're an Element Insider, meaning you've bought an Element Insider bundle in the last
[00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:52.180]   nine months, you're eligible to get sort of early access to Element Sparkling.
[00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:56.260]   You can just go to the Element Sparkling product page at drinkelement.com and they'll help
[00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:59.460]   you figure out if you're an insider or not, but I just wanted to mention that.
[00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:01.740]   So we've got the drink mix, which I love.
[00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:08.140]   And now coming soon is Element Sparkling, which Element Insiders can try right now before
[00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:11.060]   the main public release.
[00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:16.240]   So you can get a free sample pack with any drink mix purchase.
[00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:24.420]   If you go to drinkelement.com/deep, that's drinkelement.com/deep.
[00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:28.380]   And if you're an Element Insider, you will also have first access to Element Sparkling,
[00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:32.060]   a bold 16 ounce can of sparkling electrolyte water.
[00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:37.180]   That's drinkelement.com/deep.
[00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:39.580]   Also want to talk about our friends at Cozy Earth.
[00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:43.840]   Cozy Earth makes the sheets that I absolutely love.
[00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:48.220]   We have multiple pairs of these sheets because I cannot tolerate any others.
[00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:53.260]   They are incredibly comfortable, very soft, and temperature regulated.
[00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:59.560]   They don't, something about the bamboo, viscose bamboo they make it out of, temperature regulates.
[00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:03.020]   I also now have a Cozy Earth, I guess you call it like a sweatshirt made out of that
[00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:04.400]   same material.
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:08.300]   It's cool on the skin, even when like it's a little bit warm, I wear that thing all the
[00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:09.300]   time.
[00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:10.380]   I love it.
[00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:15.820]   We just bought some Cozy Earth for, I'm going to tell you two real Cozy Earth stories.
[00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:16.820]   Okay.
[00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:19.540]   A, my parents are coming to watch the kids.
[00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:22.860]   I'm going to England to do some book tour stuff and my wife's going to join me for some
[00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:23.860]   of that.
[00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:25.020]   My parents are going to watch the kids.
[00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:28.820]   Our gift to them is we bought them some Cozy Earth products because like we know they will
[00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:29.820]   love it.
[00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:36.260]   Second, we went on a trip recently, just a weekend trip to beach rental.
[00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:40.780]   And normally we would just have the linen service, like bring us sheets.
[00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:42.340]   This time we said, no, no, no.
[00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:46.060]   I would rather have the difficulty of having to bring our own sheets and undo the beds
[00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:50.260]   and bring the sheets home so that we can bring our Cozy Earth sheets with us.
[00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:51.420]   Cozy Earth knows this.
[00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:58.540]   They now actually have a tote, a travel friendly hassle-free Cozy Earth bedding that can come
[00:26:58.540 --> 00:26:59.780]   in an adorable tote.
[00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:01.140]   So it's very easy to travel.
[00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:06.780]   We're not the only ones who love this so much that we want to bring it with us when we travel.
[00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:13.700]   So if you want to rest easy on your vacation or any other time, take a trip to cozyearth.com/cow.
[00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:19.260]   Then you have to type in my personal code cow at checkout and you'll get an exclusive
[00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:25.180]   35% off that's promo code cow for 35% off.
[00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:27.700]   It's my way of saying thanks for listening.
[00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:33.380]   Oh, one favorite, choose podcast in the survey they offer you after you order and then select
[00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:34.860]   my show from the dropdown menu.
[00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:38.660]   I know it's like an extra 10 seconds, but that's how Cozy Earth really knows you came
[00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:41.580]   for my show and it really makes a big difference.
[00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:42.980]   So hopefully you'll do that.
[00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:45.980]   That's cozyearth.com/cow, promo code cow.
[00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:47.300]   Thanks and happy sleeping.
[00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:49.980]   All right, let's do some questions.
[00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:53.180]   Who do we have first?
[00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:54.500]   First question is from Nate.
[00:27:54.500 --> 00:28:01.180]   I've struggled with distraction seeking with technology since I was a preteen.
[00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:03.700]   Distraction seeking technology as I was a preteen.
[00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:08.220]   With a great deal of effort, I've made significant progress using your techniques, hat blocking,
[00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:14.220]   the phone foyer method, but I struggle when I'm sick or I have a poor night's sleep.
[00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:17.220]   Basically I relapse and waste a huge portion of the next day.
[00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:19.180]   How can I get back on track when this happens?
[00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:24.540]   Well, I sort of have a double barreled answer to this question that my two answers will
[00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:27.700]   seem different, but they can relate.
[00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:32.340]   So my first answer is like hard days are hard days.
[00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:35.800]   You know, you're sick, you're really tired.
[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:39.020]   It's okay to say, yeah, I'm not going to get a lot done this day.
[00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:42.520]   Let's start with that, right?
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:47.620]   We want to adopt a slow productivity mindset, which is about over time producing stuff you're
[00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:51.660]   proud about, which is very different than a fast or pseudo productivity mindset, which
[00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:54.580]   says what matters is activity.
[00:28:54.580 --> 00:29:00.780]   If you've internalized the pseudo productivity mindset to be kind of sick and like, I didn't
[00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:01.780]   really get much done today.
[00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:02.780]   It seems like a problem.
[00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:04.340]   I was unproductive.
[00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:05.820]   I was less valuable to the world.
[00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:07.620]   This was a quote unquote bad day.
[00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:10.260]   If you have a slow productivity mindset, it doesn't matter.
[00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:13.060]   You're like, yeah, today's not a day I'm going to produce much since that's good.
[00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:14.580]   So I did it.
[00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:19.060]   What matters though is, hey, I'm still on track for at the end of this season to have
[00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:20.700]   like produce some stuff I'm proud of.
[00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:27.180]   I mean, I talk about it in my book, Slow Productivity, one of the examples I give, Mary Curie honing
[00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:32.700]   in on isolating radium so she could build a, have a first example and really understand
[00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:36.580]   radioactivity in a way that wasn't known before she was going to win a Nobel prize for this
[00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:42.220]   work, working in this, in Paris and this sort of drafty basement research lab honing in
[00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:46.740]   summer comes like now we're going on vacation for two months, we're going to France.
[00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:49.500]   The pseudo productivity mindset is like, oh my God, you're so unvaluable.
[00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:51.060]   Why would you do that?
[00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:52.760]   That's you're unproductive.
[00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:55.900]   The slow productivity mindset says, I am working on something cool.
[00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:56.900]   I'm going to produce something cool.
[00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:57.900]   And she did.
[00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:00.100]   And she came back and she kept working on it and she got the result and she got a Nobel
[00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:05.100]   prize, took some more vacations, got another Nobel prize.
[00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:06.100]   Things were fine.
[00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:11.180]   So let's get rid of the mindset of taking time or slowing down or having variation in
[00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:12.620]   your intensity is somehow a bad thing.
[00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:13.620]   It's not.
[00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:18.460]   Now here's my other answer, which could also be relevant.
[00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:22.220]   If what you're thinking is like, look, I, it's not that I'm feeling really bad and there's
[00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:23.220]   nothing I could do.
[00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:27.340]   It's just like, if anything goes off a little bit, I get stuck in a sort of rabbit hole
[00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:31.020]   of distracting behaviors when there's better things I could have been doing, not me more
[00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:34.420]   productive things, but like it, it takes away the quality of my day.
[00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:39.140]   Like if it's a relapse type situation, it's not what I wanted my day to be.
[00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:42.660]   It just, that was enough to hook me into that.
[00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:45.740]   There's a lot of ideas about this from the addiction literature.
[00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:47.780]   These are called habit triggers.
[00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:53.140]   Smokers have this big problem after they quit, that there's very certain things that happen
[00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:54.700]   that they just associate with a cigarette.
[00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:58.260]   And when those things happen it's very difficult not to smoke.
[00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:03.140]   The addiction literature, they say, yeah, you have to practice and cultivate alternative
[00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:04.140]   habits.
[00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:05.140]   All right.
[00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:09.180]   In this situation, it's like, I'm a little bit tired and I'm not really on my schedule.
[00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:10.620]   Like what do I do?
[00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:14.340]   What's like the habit I fall back onto to sort of like rewind or recharge that's not
[00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:17.100]   just going down a YouTube rabbit hole for eight hours.
[00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:21.700]   And you practice with something different until you associate those triggers with the
[00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:22.700]   new behavior.
[00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:24.540]   So you have to define the triggers that I'm tired.
[00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:25.540]   I'm a little bit sick.
[00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:29.220]   I mean, for you, I think it's the, like something is off and it knocks me off the ability to
[00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:33.020]   follow a more optimized or structured schedule.
[00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:37.060]   Have different fallbacks you do in those situations, which are recharging, but don't leave you
[00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:41.020]   with this feeling of, I really don't, not happy with how my day unfolded.
[00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:44.180]   So both of these answers can be true at the same time.
[00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:45.180]   Ease up on yourself.
[00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:47.840]   Productivity is not activity.
[00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:48.900]   It's outcome over time.
[00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:54.180]   And the second, if you're not happy with yourself when you fall into these, but you're like,
[00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:55.820]   I don't want to do this regardless.
[00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:56.820]   I don't care if I'm sick or not.
[00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:58.780]   I don't want to be on TikTok all day.
[00:31:58.780 --> 00:31:59.780]   It's a trigger.
[00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:02.380]   You have to have a specific other thing you associate with that trigger and it'll take
[00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:06.740]   a few cycles of finding what works well and doing it a few times until you change your
[00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:08.180]   association with that.
[00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:12.340]   So anyways, thank you, Nate, what do we got next?
[00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:14.180]   Next question from Zachary.
[00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:16.820]   My attention span seems to have diminished to a new low.
[00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:21.260]   I used to love movies, reading books and having long conversations with people.
[00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:24.940]   Now I can't do any of these things and all I do is scroll TikTok, Instagram or other
[00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:27.460]   iPads or apps on my iPad.
[00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:32.340]   Is there a way out of this without completely cutting out all these technologies?
[00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:36.180]   My first question is why not cut out all these technologies?
[00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:40.580]   The things you're mentioning that you're not able to do anymore seem like they're important
[00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:41.860]   to you.
[00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:48.380]   Movies, reading, having long conversations, those feel like things that you don't want
[00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:49.380]   to necessarily give up.
[00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:52.240]   Now, what are you giving them up for?
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:56.500]   Scrolling TikTok and Instagram and other apps on your iPad.
[00:32:56.500 --> 00:33:00.940]   So why don't you consider prioritizing that first group of things over the second group
[00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:02.700]   of things?
[00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:06.420]   Now if we want to structure this a little bit, abstention might sound scary.
[00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:08.300]   Do a digital clutter.
[00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:13.300]   Like I talk about on my book, Digital Minimalism, say I'm going to take a 30-day, I guess step
[00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:20.260]   away for 30 days from all these optional personal technology uses, 30 days.
[00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:24.800]   Then during those 30 days, I'm going to very aggressively explore alternative activities
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:25.800]   that are important to me.
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:27.020]   I'm going to build rituals around them.
[00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:28.300]   I'm going to put aside time for them.
[00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:29.300]   I'm going to go to the library.
[00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:30.300]   I'm going to read in the woods.
[00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:31.780]   I'm going to set up a lot of social events with friends.
[00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:35.540]   I'm going to go to the Revival House movie theaters three times a week to see all these
[00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:37.460]   different movies that are playing.
[00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:41.780]   You really aggressively start experimenting with and structuring your day around other
[00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:43.220]   sorts of valuable activities.
[00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:44.580]   Don't just sit there and white knuckle it.
[00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:46.060]   Do other things.
[00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:50.700]   And then at the end of the 30 days, say, "Okay, is there something really important that I'm
[00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:56.180]   missing from the technologies I temporarily put aside?"
[00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:58.780]   I think you're going to find for most of these things, you're going to say, "No, nothing
[00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:02.460]   really bad happened that I wasn't on TikTok."
[00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:07.260]   There may be a few uses that pop up where you're like, "Well, using Instagram to keep
[00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:11.740]   up whatever with my nieces and nephews and the photos that are posted of them, that is
[00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:15.740]   important to me because then when I'm on the text threads, I feel more connected to what's
[00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:16.740]   going on in my family."
[00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:20.700]   If you find these specific uses, then you can say, "Great.
[00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:24.440]   If that's what I need to really miss about this tool, how do I put that back into my
[00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:26.940]   life in a more focused way with fences around it?"
[00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:31.740]   And so in this example, if this is really the thing you missed about Instagram, you
[00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:35.500]   could say, "Well, it doesn't have to be on my phone.
[00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:41.340]   What I really should do is why don't I, on Fridays, log on to Instagram on my computer.
[00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:43.420]   It's kind of an ugly interface on there.
[00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:48.760]   Only follow my family members, see what's going on with my nephews or nieces, or maybe
[00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:52.580]   just move more of this to our family text thread, which doesn't have that same sort
[00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:57.920]   of addictive pull that the app has, and just sort of post more of my own photos on there
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:01.380]   so other people are posting photos, and now we can really keep up with each other without
[00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:03.660]   having to be in an addictive ecosystem."
[00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:09.180]   When you know what you're trying to do with the technology, you can put up good fences.
[00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:13.620]   This is very different than what most people do, which is saying, "I, by default, bring
[00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:20.060]   these technologies into my life if they could be cool, and I wait until I feel as if the
[00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:24.740]   negative pressures of this technology are so big that I feel like, okay, now I have
[00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:26.540]   to throw up my hands and get rid of it."
[00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:30.420]   That doesn't work very well because unless the technology is really destroying your life,
[00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:31.740]   it's a hard burden to pass.
[00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:34.820]   You'll think, "Yeah, it is bad, but a lot of times it's not bad."
[00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:39.220]   That's the issue with these tools, like Instagram or TikTok.
[00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:40.740]   A lot of it is fine.
[00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:42.260]   It's the volume of what you do.
[00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:43.960]   It's how it makes you feel over time.
[00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:46.020]   It's specific content on the tools.
[00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:50.580]   So if you're just strictly trying to build a case against something, it's a very hard
[00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:53.260]   case to make when it comes to technology.
[00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:57.700]   If you're instead trying to build a case for using something, like what's the positive
[00:35:57.700 --> 00:35:59.060]   case for using this tool?
[00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:02.840]   What do I really need in my life that's very important in this tool?
[00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:03.980]   That becomes difficult as well.
[00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:07.780]   You're like, "Well, there's not much there really," or "This thing's important, but why
[00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:09.740]   not just put these fences around it?"
[00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:15.860]   So do the digital to clutter, Nate, and be willing to radically change your relationship
[00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:16.860]   with these tools.
[00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:19.940]   I want to be the one to tell you, if you're not watching movies and reading and talking
[00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:24.220]   with your friends and family, and this matters to you, and you're doing this because you
[00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:28.460]   need to scroll TikTok more, Instagram more, that's a problem and you should fix it.
[00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:30.400]   Those first things are more important than these second things.
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:35.260]   Those first things, especially as you get older, are going to bring more sort of sustainable
[00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:38.680]   goodness into your life than the second set of things.
[00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:40.860]   The second set of things is your factory shift.
[00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:45.100]   You're checking in at your factory at the ByteDance or MetaFactory to do your shift,
[00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:47.360]   giving data over so they can make money off of it.
[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:51.860]   You don't have to keep that job if you find these other things to be more important.
[00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:53.660]   So I'll give you that strong message.
[00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:57.540]   Leaving those technologies is not a bad thing, but do the digital to clutter and find out
[00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:00.300]   a little bit more subtly what's important here and what's not.
[00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:03.860]   All right, who do we got?
[00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:08.100]   - Next question's from Elmarie, "I'm in a master's program and find it hard to schedule
[00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:12.260]   deep work sessions throughout the day as my core schedule is all over the place.
[00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:15.980]   Once I get in a groove, it's time to pack up and head to my next class.
[00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:20.100]   How can I schedule deep work with a scattered class schedule?"
[00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:21.100]   - Good question.
[00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:26.260]   Sort of like a classic early Cal academic advice question.
[00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:28.580]   Autopilot what you can.
[00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:32.980]   So any work that happens regularly each week, you just know this thing is due every Friday.
[00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:36.340]   We have to do reading response every Tuesday and Thursday.
[00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:42.020]   Find the right time and the right place to do that work, and then keep that constant
[00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:43.020]   week to week.
[00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:46.980]   And you got to be really realistic about this, like, how much time do I really need to do
[00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:47.980]   this problem set?
[00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:50.980]   Well, it might be you need three sessions, and one of them has to be three hours.
[00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:55.560]   Like, be realistic about how much time you need to successfully finish the recurring
[00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:59.940]   work at least 90% of the time, same day, same places.
[00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:05.460]   It's on your calendar recurring, so that you're taking out the decision-making, the energy
[00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:08.640]   expenditure of like, "What do I want to work on next?"
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:11.600]   And talking yourself into actually getting the energy to work on it.
[00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:14.460]   So autopilot as much work as you can.
[00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:18.780]   The other heuristic I tell students is don't waste first thing in the morning.
[00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:23.060]   If your first class is at 10, there might be a really nice block in there, right?
[00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:28.360]   That like 8.30 to 10 or something where you could get a big chunk of things done.
[00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:31.660]   So don't necessarily wait until you're well into the day before you start thinking about
[00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:34.700]   time as being fair game for getting things done.
[00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:38.340]   That time in between classes, a lot can get done there.
[00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:42.660]   If it's too scattered to finish big things, figure out consistently how to break up big
[00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:43.660]   things.
[00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:45.140]   So like, okay, here's what I do.
[00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:49.240]   I have this hour between these two classes, for example, it's not enough time to finish
[00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:50.240]   a problem set.
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:55.160]   But I know consistently, that's usually enough time to prepare a problem set that I'm working
[00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:56.160]   on.
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:39:00.780]   Go through the problems, answer the easy ones, figure out what the hard ones are and what
[00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:03.940]   I need to look that up for and like where that material is.
[00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:06.220]   And that's like problem set prepping.
[00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:10.180]   And then maybe the next day, I have like this two-hour block where if I tackle a prepped
[00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:14.020]   problem set, I can get a draft of like all of the answers typically.
[00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:18.780]   And then another day, I have another hour-long slot, which is a problem set polishing, where
[00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:22.100]   I go through and I rewrite all of my answers for my notes on to what I'm going to submit
[00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:24.100]   and I double check the math that takes about an hour.
[00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:28.420]   If I do these three blocks consistently, same time, same places every week, the problem
[00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:30.760]   set gets done and it looks good.
[00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:35.320]   So if these blocks are small and the things you need to do are big, have a consistent
[00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:37.960]   way of breaking up the work and then autopilot to a smaller schedule.
[00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:43.720]   So I'm a big fan of recurrent work in school should have a recurrent strategy for being
[00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:44.720]   handled.
[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:48.800]   All right, rock and rolling, Jesse, who do we have next?
[00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:50.680]   - Next question is from Danny.
[00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:53.920]   I'm coming to the end of my month of digital decluttering.
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:57.080]   To say it's been helpful would be a massive understatement.
[00:39:57.080 --> 00:40:01.240]   Since getting off of Reddit and YouTube comment sections, my anxiety has disappeared.
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:03.860]   My question relates to letting things back in my life.
[00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:07.120]   I was most looking forward to returning to some video games, but worried that it will
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:10.720]   take away from my new love of reading difficult books.
[00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:12.000]   How should I balance this?
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.560]   - Well, Danny, first, I appreciate the mini case study there.
[00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:21.780]   Zachary from before, listen to the benefit Danny got from digital decluttering.
[00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:25.320]   Reading Reddit and YouTube comment sections, which was probably just like a default behavior
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:28.800]   for Danny, was giving him anxiety.
[00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:32.200]   And he learned in his declutter, I feel better when I'm not doing that.
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:33.320]   He no longer does that.
[00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:35.280]   His life feels better.
[00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:39.240]   We don't realize sometimes the cognitive burden of our technological habits until we take
[00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:40.240]   a break from them.
[00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:44.940]   All right, to the specific question, video games versus books, I'm going to argue having
[00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:48.440]   rituals around both, Danny, being intentional about it.
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:52.000]   So when it comes to video games, I think it's fine if there's like a particular video game
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:57.640]   you really like playing, or you like the idea of there's a new video game, I like video
[00:40:57.640 --> 00:41:01.320]   games, I'm going to play this through over the next month or two, and then like a new
[00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:04.480]   game comes out, I get that game and I play it through.
[00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:05.920]   I think that's fine.
[00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:10.400]   Video games are a pretty impressive media art form right now.
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:12.760]   They have budgets bigger than big Hollywood movies.
[00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:15.160]   They make more money than big Hollywood movies in a lot of cases.
[00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:17.720]   It's an interesting art form.
[00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:20.240]   The danger here, I think, is online video games.
[00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:24.240]   So if it's a video game that you play it online with other people, those can be some of the
[00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:27.200]   most addictive activities in the whole digital space.
[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:29.120]   Be very wary of those.
[00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:32.320]   Engineered games that are meant to be played over about a 40 to 50 hour period that you
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:36.120]   spread out over a couple months and it has an arc and then it finishes, it's like a drawn-out
[00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:39.020]   movie or novel experience, fantastic.
[00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:42.760]   Online games, I just say there be dragons.
[00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:48.120]   That can eat up endless time and press buttons in a way that almost nothing else can.
[00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:52.560]   If you want more on that, read Adam Alter's book, Irresistible, where he talks about addictive
[00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:53.740]   technology.
[00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:58.960]   Those massively multiplayer online video games are the most addictive technology, so be wary
[00:41:58.960 --> 00:41:59.960]   of those.
[00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:00.960]   All right.
[00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:01.960]   So what do I mean by rituals?
[00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:03.720]   I have a ritual around video games.
[00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:04.760]   This is when and how I do it.
[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:05.760]   I look forward to it.
[00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:07.240]   I have a ritual around reading hard books.
[00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:08.280]   This is when and where I do it.
[00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:10.200]   I've learned to look forward to it.
[00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:14.680]   Like for video games, it could be like, yeah, there's certain nights, like Thursday night
[00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:19.200]   after dinner, I have this nice period and also like Sunday morning, these are like my
[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:25.240]   video game times and I put it aside and I can really get lost in the game for three
[00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:26.240]   hours.
[00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:27.860]   I do this two times a week or three times a week.
[00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:29.560]   You know, that could be fine.
[00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:32.760]   It's when I do it, where I do it, I look forward to it.
[00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:33.760]   Same thing with books.
[00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:37.560]   Yeah, I really, I want to get in this habit of reading hard books and here's how I do
[00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:38.560]   it.
[00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:41.960]   It's, you know, it's like most nights at seven, like after dinner, but before I put
[00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:46.680]   on TV and I make the certain tea or have like a little bit of whiskey or like whatever,
[00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:50.600]   you know, you can make a thing about it, put on a record and I just make this a habit.
[00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:53.080]   I have a ritual around that it's done at the same time.
[00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:57.200]   Just have these really nice rituals around both of the things.
[00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:59.600]   Rituals that are built to a schedule that gives you a reasonable balance.
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:01.960]   So I think video games are cool.
[00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:04.600]   I just don't like the massively multiplayer online ones.
[00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:05.920]   They're meant to be addictive.
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:11.560]   If the game cost you 70 bucks and you can only play it for 40 hours, I have no problem
[00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:12.560]   with that.
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:18.440]   If the game was free and you can play it 40 hours a week, I mean, and still not be enough.
[00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:20.040]   Be very, very wary about that.
[00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:21.040]   Right?
[00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:22.040]   That's the way I think about that.
[00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:25.680]   So just make rituals and schedules about both those things and keep both of those things
[00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:26.680]   still in your life.
[00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:28.480]   And congratulations on the declutter sticking.
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:33.720]   I mean, imagine all the cool stuff you can do without that time spent stressing about
[00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:35.920]   Reddit and YouTube comments.
[00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:39.480]   All right, what do we got next?
[00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:42.920]   Next question is our slow productivity corner.
[00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:43.920]   Oh, fantastic.
[00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:53.200]   Let's get that music.
[00:43:53.200 --> 00:44:00.200]   It's from Dirk and Dirk says slow productivity embraces a larger timescale.
[00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:05.080]   This makes perfect sense if you expect to have enough lifetime left to finish your projects,
[00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:07.900]   i.e. books and achieve your goals.
[00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:10.640]   But how does the idea of slow productivity relate to age?
[00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:14.040]   How do you apply it to older people who fear that they may be running out of time?
[00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:16.280]   A good question, Dirk.
[00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:19.960]   For people who don't know, slow productivity corner is our question.
[00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:24.560]   Once per episode, we have at least one question that is related to my new book, Slow Productivity.
[00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:25.560]   All right.
[00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:29.520]   So Dirk is talking about an idea I mentioned in an earlier question of this episode as
[00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:36.920]   well that slow productivity says, look at productivity on longer timescales.
[00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:41.520]   Not did I have a productive day, but like was the last five years productive, right?
[00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:46.440]   When you think about productivity at larger timescales, you don't sweat the busyness of
[00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:47.720]   a particular day.
[00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:51.280]   What you worry about is like returning to important things over time.
[00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:52.960]   All right.
[00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:56.960]   So Dirk, what you're saying is like, you know, if I'm later on in life, maybe I don't want
[00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:58.280]   to be thinking about a 10 year timeframe.
[00:44:58.280 --> 00:44:59.280]   I think that's fine.
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:00.280]   I think fair enough.
[00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:01.280]   Right.
[00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:04.360]   There's other reasons, by the way, that you don't want to be thinking about a too long
[00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:07.760]   of a timeframe as well, unrelated to being older.
[00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:12.360]   So Dirk, like in slow productivity, I talk about, there's a section where I talk about
[00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:16.720]   laying out your vision for the longterm and measuring your productivity against it.
[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:22.200]   And I said, there's natural, there's sometimes there's natural breaks in this.
[00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:27.360]   Like if you're in school, you're probably thinking about what do I want to look back
[00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:32.040]   on my school experience and say, this is what I did and here's what I'm proud of it.
[00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:33.480]   That could just be two more years.
[00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:36.280]   You're a sophomore, you're thinking about your next two years of school.
[00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:41.060]   It could be a particular job, like a posting.
[00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:42.320]   I work for the state department.
[00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:47.280]   I've been posted to, you know, Tel Aviv for the next two or three years.
[00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:48.720]   That's a natural constraint.
[00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:52.760]   I want to just think about what do I, what do I want to look back on this post, this
[00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:57.840]   time limited part of my life, what I want to look back at and say happened in here.
[00:45:57.840 --> 00:45:59.640]   I would do this when we had babies, right?
[00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:03.920]   Like I would see that as there's this particular year, typically when you have a new baby and
[00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:05.720]   like, what do I want that year to look like?
[00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:09.340]   And it's very different because a very difficult year in terms of like, you're trying to take
[00:46:09.340 --> 00:46:14.280]   care of this young thing and you have a different, different measure of what productive means
[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:15.740]   than in another part of your life.
[00:46:15.740 --> 00:46:20.240]   So Dirk, these longer timescales don't have to be decades.
[00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:21.880]   It could be like, what do I want to do?
[00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:24.720]   Like what would productive be for me for this year?
[00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:26.720]   What would productive be for me for this season?
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:31.880]   It's a particularly, completely fine timescale, like, okay, it's winter time.
[00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:33.120]   What do I want to do?
[00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:35.280]   Like what would I look back and say this was a successful winter?
[00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:39.000]   Like, well, you know, I want to learn how to do this.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.920]   I want to finally like clean that out.
[00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:45.400]   I want to like spend time outside every, like build a habit of like getting outside every
[00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:46.720]   day when it's cold.
[00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:51.860]   So we can, the timescale bigger than just the immediate future is key for slow productivity,
[00:46:51.860 --> 00:46:54.320]   but it doesn't also have to be the distance future.
[00:46:54.320 --> 00:47:00.120]   The timescale used to slowly measure productivity can vary depending on what's going on in your
[00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:01.120]   life.
[00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:02.120]   All right.
[00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:03.120]   So good, slow productivity question, Dirk.
[00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:09.080]   I think we need that music one more time, Jesse.
[00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:17.400]   All right, let's, do we have a call?
[00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:18.400]   We do.
[00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:19.400]   Let's do a call.
[00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:20.400]   Hi, Cal.
[00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:21.400]   This is JJ calling.
[00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:28.080]   I'm a senior in high school, and I had a question regarding formulating a deep life vision and
[00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:29.640]   living that out.
[00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:34.880]   So I have some big decisions coming up regarding where to go to school for college and university,
[00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:37.880]   what to major in, what to study and eventually what career to go into.
[00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:44.440]   But given my youth, I don't know how to formulate an actual deep life.
[00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:51.240]   I just simply don't have enough life experience to know what a life well-lived good life would
[00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:52.440]   look like.
[00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:57.400]   So I'm hoping you could speak on to fellow young people like myself who just don't have
[00:47:57.400 --> 00:48:02.400]   the life experience to know what a deep life should look like and how to formulate that
[00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:03.400]   vision.
[00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:04.400]   Thank you.
[00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:06.280]   That's a great question.
[00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:12.320]   So let me talk briefly, generally about my philosophy around the deep life and then let's
[00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:17.600]   get to your specific question about what someone at your age, a high school senior, how you
[00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:19.120]   should be thinking about these ideas.
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:23.480]   All right, so what's my general conception around the deep life, a term that I coined
[00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:29.120]   early in the pandemic, and it's sort of our shorthand for a life that's lived on purpose.
[00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:30.280]   It's intentional.
[00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:33.760]   You've constructed the life in a way to amplify the stuff you really care about and reduce
[00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:35.280]   the stuff you don't.
[00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:37.640]   It's a life you're sort of proud to be living.
[00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:40.040]   It's a life that's remarkable to other people who know you.
[00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:43.360]   So this is what people really want.
[00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:48.920]   That sense of I have designed, my life is mine and it's on purpose is what people really
[00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:52.160]   seem to want and what a lot of people seem to be missing.
[00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:54.800]   So what's my general philosophy around this?
[00:48:54.800 --> 00:49:01.560]   Well, longtime listeners of the show knows I'm not a fan of what I would call goal centric
[00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:04.740]   planning, which I think is the dominant.
[00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:09.000]   This is the dominant mode of thinking about something like the deep life in the Western
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:14.080]   culture, especially American culture of the last hundred, maybe 150 years, but especially
[00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:16.980]   the last hundred years or so.
[00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:22.080]   It's this idea of you need a big goal, a cool goal, right?
[00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:25.280]   Like this big thing I'm going to go after and do.
[00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:30.960]   And if I can get that cool goal in its slipstream, the rest of my life will become good.
[00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:33.240]   Often this is professional, right?
[00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:37.440]   So this could mean a couple of things that could mean we have the follow your passion
[00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:38.440]   terminology here.
[00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:41.640]   So often this means like, well, if I can just find the perfect job, that's my passion.
[00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:44.100]   My whole life is going to feel redeemed and validate.
[00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:45.680]   I'm going to really enjoy my life.
[00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:47.960]   Sometimes it's much more just baldly achievement focused.
[00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:52.520]   If I could just reach this level of achievement in this complicated competitive path, the
[00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:53.960]   rest of my life will fall into place.
[00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:55.880]   It's a big, bold goal.
[00:49:55.880 --> 00:49:59.880]   We see, especially during times of disruption like the financial crisis, and then more recently
[00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:04.360]   during the pandemic, we have location-based, goal-based planning.
[00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:09.520]   If I could just move to this dramatic place, my life is going to be better.
[00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:14.120]   I could just leave the city and be on a farm or whatever.
[00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:17.360]   In the side effect of this one big change is going to make a big difference.
[00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:21.160]   The other type of goal that goal-centric planning often builds around is ideology.
[00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:28.000]   If I could just have like an all-encompassing ideology that I can dedicate my life towards,
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:32.160]   then my life is going to be remarkable and all the other parts are going to be good.
[00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:33.160]   Here's the problem.
[00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:37.160]   That doesn't typically work because there's a lot of elements that go into defining your
[00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:38.920]   everyday experience.
[00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:46.080]   It is unlikely that the pursuit of a specific grand but narrow goal is going to happen to
[00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:50.060]   have the right positive change in all these different aspects of your life, many of which
[00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:53.600]   have nothing to do with professional pursuits.
[00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:56.160]   So I'm a big believer in lifestyle-centric planning.
[00:50:56.160 --> 00:51:00.280]   Why don't you just directly identify, "This is what I want the different aspects of my
[00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:06.160]   life to be like," and then say, "How do I directly engineer my life to get closer
[00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:08.200]   to these things?"
[00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:11.960]   And now it's more like you're moving chess pieces around the chessboard, the chess pieces
[00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:13.900]   here being the particular options you have.
[00:51:13.900 --> 00:51:20.360]   Well, if I go for like this job in this place in this way, these three different things
[00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:24.240]   I can sort of get closer to, and this thing over here I could handle by doing this, it's
[00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:28.360]   just directly getting to the core of the issue, which is what defines the quality of your
[00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:34.040]   life is not what is the top item on your resume or your obituary.
[00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:37.560]   It tends to be what is most days feel like.
[00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:38.560]   Where am I living?
[00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:39.560]   What am I doing?
[00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:40.560]   Who am I around?
[00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:41.560]   What's taking up my time?
[00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:42.560]   What's not taking up my time?
[00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:44.600]   It's the day-to-day lifestyle that determines your subjective well-being.
[00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:49.120]   So why not directly identify and engineer that lifestyle to be what you want, as opposed
[00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:55.880]   to hoping that one big goal, one big swing will somehow fix all these parts of your life
[00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:59.200]   in just some sort of happy coincidence.
[00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:02.080]   That's really my approach towards the deep life lifestyle-centric planning over goal-centric
[00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:03.080]   planning.
[00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:05.120]   All right, so now let's get to the particular question here.
[00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:08.680]   The caller is in high school, about to go to college, and says, "I don't know how to
[00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:13.280]   make these plans yet," to which my answer is, "Yeah, you don't, and that's fine."
[00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:18.360]   The first reasonable lifestyle-centric plan that you should produce will be later in your
[00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:22.920]   college career when you're deciding what to do right out of college.
[00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:26.840]   So you're going to build your first plan later in your college career to cover through your
[00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:28.400]   mid-20s.
[00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:33.080]   Expect to revise that plan after a few years out of college and in the real world, and
[00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:36.720]   then you'll be able to revise that plan to cover all of your time through your 20s and
[00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:40.400]   set you up for interesting options in your 30s, but not be too specific.
[00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:42.640]   As you approach your 30s, you're going to revise this plan again.
[00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:44.960]   So you revise these plans a lot.
[00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:47.100]   You are too young to have your first plan.
[00:52:47.100 --> 00:52:49.000]   So what is your goal for college?
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:55.920]   It's going to be gathering enough raw material to build your first plan later in your college
[00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:56.920]   years.
[00:52:56.920 --> 00:53:02.080]   Some of this is going to come from just you getting older and being in an environment
[00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:06.160]   where you have more autonomy that you can just reflect and figure out yourself and your
[00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:07.160]   identity.
[00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:10.320]   You're going to be learning things about yourself and about the world, and you can build your
[00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:14.400]   sort of first draft of your adult identity, which will help you identify your first lifestyle-centric
[00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:15.440]   plan.
[00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:19.480]   It's also where you're going to be able to expose yourself to new fields.
[00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:23.320]   You're going to gain a lot of information about what people do.
[00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:26.200]   This person graduated, they went to this job.
[00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:29.880]   You're just going to learn a lot about yourself and about the world that will help you make
[00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:32.520]   your first plan later in your college career.
[00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:37.180]   So you're off the hook having to have a vision right now.
[00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:41.160]   So then how do you select a college?
[00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:45.080]   Lower the stakes in your mind.
[00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:49.480]   You're not selecting a college right now as a key.
[00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:53.080]   This college has to be just right, otherwise my plan for a good life won't happen and I'll
[00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:54.080]   be miserable.
[00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:56.440]   Lower those stakes.
[00:53:56.440 --> 00:54:02.720]   You know, go to probably like the best school that is reasonable for you to go to, like
[00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:05.240]   the best school I can get into and we can afford.
[00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:06.360]   Like you're never going to go wrong with that.
[00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:10.200]   I want to be around interesting people, think about interesting things, and have access
[00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:15.040]   to as many opportunities as possible so that when it comes time to determine my first lifestyle-centric
[00:54:15.040 --> 00:54:18.280]   plan and start making some decisions for life after college, I'm going to have as many interesting
[00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:19.400]   opportunities as possible.
[00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:25.280]   So it's like go to the best school that you can afford is not bad advice.
[00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:29.640]   For a lot of people that means like, let me aim, because colleges get expensive, folks.
[00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:34.080]   It might mean like, let me aim for like, I have a good state university in my state,
[00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:38.080]   unless like things are my academic, whatever's going well enough that I can maybe get access
[00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:41.880]   to like a pretty elite school, we can figure out a way to make that work and maybe that's
[00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:42.880]   worth it.
[00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:48.560]   If you're a, look, if you have a very specific skill set or interest, there's also some matches
[00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:49.560]   that happen here.
[00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:54.400]   I mean, if you're really into math, if you're really like into science and math and are
[00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:59.240]   really good at it and it turns you on and you're like bored, then like a school like
[00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:01.860]   MIT is going to give you an experience you're not going to get elsewhere.
[00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:06.960]   If you're really into government, like for whatever reason, you're young Bill Clinton,
[00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:07.960]   think about Georgetown.
[00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:09.040]   Right.
[00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:16.040]   I mean, there's classes here that we teach at our campus downtown where the class walks
[00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:19.300]   to the Capitol to sit in on hearings as part of the class, right?
[00:55:19.300 --> 00:55:24.640]   So you know, you're, we have a longtime listener who's a French horn player, shout out with
[00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:26.640]   a Juilliard because, okay, that makes sense.
[00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:32.060]   But if you don't, it's not like I need this very specific thing, go to the best school
[00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:33.060]   you can that makes sense.
[00:55:33.060 --> 00:55:36.560]   You want to be around the best people you can have access to the best opportunities
[00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:37.860]   you can.
[00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:43.060]   Mix the raw materials, gather, gather, gather, and then we'll make our first plan as we get
[00:55:43.060 --> 00:55:44.640]   near the end of college.
[00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:47.760]   Let me point you towards a couple of things to help you get through that college experience.
[00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:52.360]   Then I want to point you towards my, my newsletter, my early days of my newsletter where I was
[00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:57.880]   mainly addressing or as mainly addressing college students, go to cal newport.com/blog, go to
[00:55:57.880 --> 00:56:04.600]   the archive, go back to 2007, 2008, read my post on this in valedictorian, read my post
[00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:05.600]   on the romantic scholar.
[00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:11.520]   I'm going to lay out there a, a mindset and framework for going through your undergraduate
[00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:15.000]   years in a way that you're exposed to lots of interesting things.
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:21.440]   You open up lots of potential, interesting opportunities, but you also have a sustainable,
[00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:25.840]   meaningful experience, intellectual, social experience on campus that's really, that you
[00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:30.600]   really enjoy, that you get to know yourself that is fulfilling.
[00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:33.040]   So you can get some advice there about how to navigate these years.
[00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:36.440]   You can gather raw material, get to know yourself, really love your time at college, have cool
[00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:38.400]   opportunities, get all those things done.
[00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:41.920]   What I hate to see, for example, is when people see college as like a bootcamp.
[00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:46.160]   Yeah, man, I got to grind through this thing because that's, what's going to open up the
[00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:49.360]   whatever job I really, the really elite job.
[00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:52.880]   And so I'm going to suffer through college so I can get that job and then I'll get the
[00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:53.880]   benefit.
[00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:57.120]   Of course, you go to the first few years of that job, like, well, this really sucks, but
[00:56:57.120 --> 00:56:58.120]   that's okay.
[00:56:58.120 --> 00:57:01.200]   If I could just suffer through this, I'll get the managing director and then I'll get
[00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:02.200]   the benefit.
[00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:04.560]   Well, then you get to that, you're like, well, this is, you know, I want to get partner.
[00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:08.000]   And so now I really got to suffer through, it never ends.
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:10.640]   Don't have the mindset of, I want to suffer through so that the benefit comes.
[00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:12.840]   So, you know, check those things out to help guide you.
[00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:16.280]   Romantic Scholars and Valedictorian to help guide you through college, go to the best
[00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:20.640]   school you can, that makes sense, the best school that makes sense for you, that you
[00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:26.520]   can gather the raw material, learn how to your adult identity and how to get interested
[00:57:26.520 --> 00:57:29.760]   in things and be an autonomous human.
[00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:33.520]   And then we'll make our first lifestyle plan as that gets a little bit farther along.
[00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:36.320]   I'm thinking about a lot more of this now, Jesse, because I'm, you know, I'm in the early
[00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:38.360]   stages of my deep life book.
[00:57:38.360 --> 00:57:42.560]   And so I'm starting to think through more, how to more clearly articulate like what the
[00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:46.240]   deep life is, this idea that emerged during the pandemic here on this podcast and the
[00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:49.720]   newsletter and how to actually pursue it.
[00:57:49.720 --> 00:57:52.600]   I'm really leaning into now just the idea of just being practical.
[00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:59.200]   Like it's just, if we put aside the what of your definition of a deep life and just get
[00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:02.760]   to the how of like, how does someone figure out what's important to them and then make
[00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:04.840]   that actually happen?
[00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:10.380]   So take out the specificity of like, these are the things that should matter to you.
[00:58:10.380 --> 00:58:12.600]   And more about, here's how you find out what matters to you.
[00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:16.240]   And then here's how you much more systematically get more of this in your life.
[00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:17.720]   It's not going to be one bold goal.
[00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:20.760]   It's going to be this sort of lifestyle centric planning that we talked about on the show.
[00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:22.240]   And like, I'm really trying to work that out.
[00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:25.560]   Have you been taking walks with a single purpose notebook?
[00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:26.560]   I filled one.
[00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:29.800]   Yeah, so I have to open up another one.
[00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:35.640]   I spent like a month, the last month of my book tour, just working on these ideas in
[00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:37.960]   a single purpose notebook.
[00:58:37.960 --> 00:58:45.280]   And then recently, I finally, I filled a feels note and I finally kind of cracked like, okay,
[00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:48.240]   I see a structure for this book I'd be happy with.
[00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:50.840]   And I recently then moved that all into Scrivener.
[00:58:50.840 --> 00:58:54.440]   So now there's a Scrivener project for the book where I can start gathering sources for
[00:58:54.440 --> 00:58:59.760]   the chapters and it's moved out of my notebooks into like my more formal professional system.
[00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:03.680]   Now that the project's unfolding, and it's going to generate a huge amount more of ideas
[00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:07.800]   and sources, it's moved from my single purpose notebook and into Scrivener.
[00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:11.880]   For those that are new to the show, we had an episode on single purpose notebooks like
[00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:13.080]   10 episodes ago.
[00:59:13.080 --> 00:59:14.080]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:15.080]   Definitely check that out.
[00:59:15.080 --> 00:59:16.320]   It's on the YouTube channel as well.
[00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:20.520]   All right, let's do a quick case study before we get to the final segment.
[00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:24.880]   Case studies where people send in a report of using some of the things we talked about
[00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:26.960]   on the show in their own life.
[00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:31.160]   So we can see what these things look like in actual people's lives.
[00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:39.320]   So this one comes from Valerie who says, "I've been tweaking CALS practices to my personal
[00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:41.640]   life as a retiree.
[00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:47.080]   I love adapting CALS practices to the range of activities I undertake in my life, voluntary
[00:59:47.080 --> 00:59:51.480]   work, life management, deepening hobbies, and interest.
[00:59:51.480 --> 01:00:00.440]   Today I had some fun thinking about how I had used a range of CALISMS to a long-winded
[01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:02.880]   but important task.
[01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:09.080]   In my new time block planner, I have decided to have themes for a morning's tasks to avoid
[01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:10.720]   context switching.
[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:12.720]   And today my theme was health.
[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:18.240]   Specifically, I dealt with three things relating to a long-term mobility issue.
[01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:23.760]   Number one, a concentrated period dedicated to making a query about my medical insurance
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:25.240]   and its coverage.
[01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:31.720]   Two, tackling a related subject because my brain was in the zone, which was investigating
[01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:35.160]   ordering some orthotic shoes online.
[01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:40.580]   And three, and one I'm very proud of, searching for and finding appropriate YouTube videos
[01:00:40.580 --> 01:00:45.120]   to learn more about chair-based yoga.
[01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:49.760]   Much of this got done as a result of deciding an overall context.
[01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:53.000]   Apologies for the detail, but it amused me to see how over the years of listening to
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:56.520]   CAL, various elements of practice have become a way of life.
[01:00:56.520 --> 01:01:01.080]   And having written this email, I've included another element, reflection for future learning,
[01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:03.840]   which I got from your episode with Dave Epstein.
[01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:05.640]   So many things and can't wait for the next episode."
[01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:09.620]   I said, "Valerie, I appreciate that case study.
[01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:14.300]   The thing I want to underscore from that for everyone else is the appreciation of the cost
[01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:16.540]   of context switching.
[01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:21.980]   We get into this a lot, but it's really hard for the human brain to switch its context
[01:01:21.980 --> 01:01:23.460]   rapidly between different things.
[01:01:23.460 --> 01:01:28.860]   This is why just going through an email inbox in order is very tiring because you have an
[01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:33.340]   email about your kid's camp and the next email is about an unrelated event and the next email
[01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:37.160]   is about your car needs to be taken in to get its registration renewed.
[01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:42.500]   Each one of these emails triggers a cognitive crisis in your brain trying, 'Oh my God, what's
[01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:43.500]   this about?
[01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:44.500]   What do we know about this?
[01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:47.340]   Let me shut down these neural networks and turn on these other neural networks.'
[01:01:47.340 --> 01:01:51.420]   We kind of force our way through and move on to the next context before we ever fully
[01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:52.420]   switch there.
[01:01:52.420 --> 01:01:53.420]   It's very tiring."
[01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:58.100]   So if you can put a lot of tasks that share the same cognitive context together, it feels
[01:01:58.100 --> 01:02:00.680]   less difficult.
[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:02.720]   It's because of the way our brain works.
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:04.440]   And that's what Valerie did.
[01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:08.440]   These are tasks that are annoying, but if you put them all together, she kind of got
[01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:13.060]   into the zone because she's like, "I'm in my personal health kind of logistical mode."
[01:02:13.060 --> 01:02:16.340]   She picked up Steam and got through a lot of these, including stuff that was optional
[01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:19.580]   that she otherwise wouldn't have done, like finally learning about chair-based yoga.
[01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:21.240]   It's a great idea.
[01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:22.500]   You can do this in your personal life.
[01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:24.060]   You can do this in a professional life.
[01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:26.420]   Type together tasks of the same type.
[01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:30.800]   You should even do this when answering emails.
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:37.120]   Have a label in Gmail for temporary inbox and go select a bunch of emails that are all
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:38.400]   the same context.
[01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:42.440]   It's all about the same project or it's all about your kid's school.
[01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:46.860]   And then just label those and show only those on your screen and answer those one by one
[01:02:46.860 --> 01:02:48.340]   by one.
[01:02:48.340 --> 01:02:51.580]   You get one or two emails in, you're like, "I'm in the zone," because your brain loads
[01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:53.560]   the context once and uses it again and again.
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:56.840]   And then go find another group of emails that are another context.
[01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:57.840]   Go through those.
[01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:03.440]   This is going to feel much better and you're going to get better results than trying to
[01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:05.280]   take all these emails and interleave them together.
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:10.040]   So I love the idea of, I call it monotasking, but working on the same context as long as
[01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:12.800]   you can, even when dealing with small things.
[01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:15.960]   And also, I appreciate the mention of the Dave Epstein episode.
[01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:17.720]   That's another sort of secret fan favorite.
[01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:18.720]   Dave is great.
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:21.320]   He's got the best ideas, I think.
[01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:22.320]   So check that out.
[01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:25.040]   That's, God, I don't, that's, it feels like it was recently.
[01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:26.040]   It was not.
[01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:27.040]   Yeah.
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:28.040]   It's been a little while, right?
[01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:29.040]   It's probably.
[01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:30.040]   I'll look it up.
[01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:31.040]   Yeah.
[01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:32.040]   Anyways, worth checking out.
[01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:33.040]   All right.
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:35.960]   We've got a final segment coming up, sort of like profiles and slowness, which I'm looking
[01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:37.240]   forward to.
[01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:40.840]   But first let's take a brief break to hear from another sponsor.
[01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:46.520]   I want to talk in particular about our longtime friends at ExpressVPN.
[01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:51.400]   Look, if you use the internet, you need a VPN.
[01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:52.900]   Here's why.
[01:03:52.900 --> 01:03:59.420]   When you access a site or service, you might be encrypting like the contents of your message,
[01:03:59.420 --> 01:04:03.040]   but the address of those messages is not encrypted.
[01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:07.960]   So if you're using a wireless access point out somewhere in public, people can look at
[01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:11.160]   what you're sending on the airwaves and see exactly what site and service you're talking
[01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:12.400]   to.
[01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:17.760]   If you're at home in the privacy of your own home, your internet service provider sees
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:21.420]   what sites and services you're talking to, they can gather that data.
[01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:22.940]   They can sell that data.
[01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:24.400]   They do gather that data.
[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:26.160]   They do sell that data.
[01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:30.440]   Going into private mode in your browser does nothing about that.
[01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:34.920]   You're still sending packets that have the address of the site and service you're using.
[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:36.440]   Anyone who's interested can see it.
[01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:38.620]   A VPN solves that problem.
[01:04:38.620 --> 01:04:40.240]   With a VPN, you do the following.
[01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:42.920]   You say, "Okay, if I want to access this site, right?
[01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:49.120]   I want to access calnewport.com, and I'm going to Google the word 'Calism.'
[01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:52.640]   There's a new website, calism.com, and I'm kind of embarrassed to go there."
[01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:54.280]   If they use a VPN, what happens?
[01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:59.200]   Instead of contacting that site directly, you send an encrypted message to a VPN server.
[01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:04.440]   Inside that encrypted message, you say, "What I really want to do is go to the Calism website."
[01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:09.560]   The VPN server contacts that site on your behalf, gets the response, encrypts it, and
[01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:11.000]   sends that back to you.
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:14.720]   So what does people near you, looking at your packets in the air, your internet service
[01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:17.280]   provider, what do they learn?
[01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:19.080]   That you are contacting a VPN server.
[01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:20.080]   That's it.
[01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:22.600]   They have no idea what sites and services you're actually using.
[01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:26.000]   So you need to use a VPN to protect your privacy online.
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:29.480]   If you do, I suggest ExpressVPN.
[01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:33.520]   They have servers all around the world, so you're never that far from a server to get
[01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:34.520]   a nice connection speed.
[01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:35.640]   They have a lot of bandwidth.
[01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:39.880]   Their software is super easy to use once you've installed it, and you can install it on any
[01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:42.560]   of the devices you use to access the internet.
[01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:45.040]   You can even install it on your wireless router at home.
[01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:49.080]   So just all communication in your house goes through a VPN server.
[01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:52.120]   Once you've installed it, you turn it on with a click, and you use your sites and services
[01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:53.120]   like normal.
[01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:55.080]   You don't even know it's on, but you get the privacy protection.
[01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:57.560]   They got plenty of bandwidth.
[01:05:57.560 --> 01:06:01.560]   Really ExpressVPN is one of the best in the business.
[01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:04.640]   Makes it easy to get the protection of VPNs.
[01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:09.240]   So if you're like me, and you believe your data is your business, secure yourself with
[01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:16.480]   the number one rated VPN on the market, visit ExpressVPN.com/Deep and you will get three
[01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:18.640]   extra months for free.
[01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:24.000]   That's E-X-P-R-E-S-S-V-P-N.com/Deep.
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.840]   Go to ExpressVPN.com/Deep to learn more.
[01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:34.920]   I also want to briefly talk about our friends at MyBodyTutor, T-U-T-O-R.
[01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:40.440]   This is a online health and fitness company that I really believe in because their idea
[01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:41.440]   makes so much sense.
[01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:47.720]   If you want to get healthier, the hard part is not necessarily getting the information,
[01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:49.120]   what you should eat, how you should exercise.
[01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:50.120]   It's the consistency.
[01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:52.000]   Actually following the advice.
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:56.080]   With MyBodyTutor, you get an online coach dedicated to you.
[01:06:56.080 --> 01:07:02.600]   They help you build a specific plan around your nutrition and your fitness fit to your
[01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:03.840]   life.
[01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:06.960]   And then, and here's the magic, you check in every day online.
[01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:08.360]   Here's how I went with my eating.
[01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:09.520]   Here's how I went with my exercise.
[01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:14.080]   So you get the consistency of knowing someone, you're being held accountable.
[01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:19.680]   Someone who really knows your goals and your situation is keeping up with what you're doing.
[01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:23.040]   And that sense of accountability means you're much more likely to be consistent.
[01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:26.320]   They can also help you adjust and correct as needed.
[01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:27.320]   This isn't quite working.
[01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:28.320]   Let's make a change.
[01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:29.320]   I have a trip coming up.
[01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:30.320]   What should I do?
[01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:33.600]   And you have that coaching, but because it's 100% online, it's going to be much cheaper
[01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:37.760]   than having a personal trainer in person or a personal nutritionist.
[01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:43.040]   So the price is right for a fantastic product, which is helping you take control over your
[01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:45.960]   own health and fitness.
[01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:51.720]   So if you're serious about getting fit, Adam Gilbert, the old fitness advice guru for my
[01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:56.960]   website and the founder of MyBodyTutor is giving deep questions listeners $50 off their
[01:07:56.960 --> 01:07:58.040]   first month.
[01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:00.920]   All you have to do is mention the podcast when you sign up.
[01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:04.220]   Look, if you have any questions, Adam wants you to call or text.
[01:08:04.220 --> 01:08:07.960]   He puts his personal cell phone number at the top of every page that shows you like
[01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:11.240]   how much of a dedication to customers this is.
[01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:12.240]   It's crazy.
[01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:13.240]   Adam's crazy.
[01:08:13.240 --> 01:08:14.240]   I love it.
[01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:15.240]   So go to MyBodyTutor.com.
[01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:16.240]   T-U-T-O-R.
[01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:18.180]   Mention deep questions to get $50 off.
[01:08:18.180 --> 01:08:20.680]   It is the way to get healthier.
[01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:25.760]   All right, Jesse, let's do our final segment.
[01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:30.160]   I want to react to something I found online that I just thought was cool.
[01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:34.320]   It's a demonstration of slowness in practice.
[01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:37.040]   You know, that's why I'm calling it kind of a case study in slowness.
[01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:39.480]   All right, I'm going to load this on the screen.
[01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:42.840]   Definitely if you're listening, if you want to see this, the link is in the show notes,
[01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:44.920]   but also this is episode 300.
[01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:47.200]   Just go to TheDeepLife.com/listen.
[01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:48.200]   Go to that episode.
[01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:49.200]   We'll post a video below.
[01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:55.680]   All right, so what this is, it's a website called A Portrait of Tanakda Tillan.
[01:08:55.680 --> 01:09:02.040]   I'm not saying that quite right, but the original name for Mexico City, Tanakda Tillan.
[01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:07.480]   Now you see this picture on here, Jesse, it looks like a photograph of a city.
[01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:15.200]   What this is, is an entirely computer generated, meticulously researched computer generated
[01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:21.400]   image of this city circa 1518.
[01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:28.240]   So this Thomas, I believe his name is Thomas Cole, he's a programmer from the Netherlands,
[01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:29.320]   just took on this project.
[01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:37.960]   He's like, what did Mexico City, when it was before the Colombian contact, what, when it
[01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:43.000]   was still, let's see, an empire ruling over more than 5 million people with 200,000 people
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:48.800]   in the city alone, this old Aztecs capital, what did it look like back then?
[01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:51.400]   And he began this long, slow process.
[01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:52.400]   Here's more.
[01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:53.400]   Look at that.
[01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:54.400]   That's computer generated, Jesse.
[01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:55.400]   That's great.
[01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:56.400]   See that?
[01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:57.880]   The temples, the causeway across the lake.
[01:09:57.880 --> 01:10:03.200]   And he spent about a year and a half just slowly learning about this, learning all the
[01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:11.160]   tools he used to build this were open source, just using free software, just slowly learning.
[01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:14.960]   There's another rendering and just sort of meticulously working on this because he just
[01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:19.880]   thought like it would be cool to just, what would it look like to go back in a time machine?
[01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:20.880]   Another picture here.
[01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:21.880]   Look at this.
[01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:22.880]   Here it is.
[01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:28.360]   The main temple at sunset, the twin pyramids.
[01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:29.360]   These pictures are cool.
[01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:30.360]   They're beautiful.
[01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:31.360]   Here's another one.
[01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:32.840]   So you can see like the main temple and the lake.
[01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:36.600]   And this is like what this, this is accurate stuff as well.
[01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:40.440]   So archeologists, people who work on this have commented on this project and said, this
[01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:41.440]   is really cool.
[01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:44.880]   I have a couple of quotes from Thomas here.
[01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:45.880]   Let's see here.
[01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:46.880]   Here's a quote from him.
[01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:49.960]   The really hard part was gathering all the information, then trying things out.
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:52.760]   How do you create a city when you don't really know anything about it?
[01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:54.480]   How do you start gathering that information?
[01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:58.080]   That was really difficult and involved throwing out a lot of things when I found different
[01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:00.240]   sources with conflicting information.
[01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:04.560]   That's part of being a pioneer venturing into the unknown, into what no one has done before.
[01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:07.120]   But also that's very difficult because it takes a lot of time.
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:09.040]   Also I don't speak Spanish and I'm not an academic.
[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:12.400]   So I really approached this as an outsider.
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:17.120]   It's a rainstorm coming across the city.
[01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:18.120]   Another cool shot.
[01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:20.400]   All this done with free software too.
[01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:27.760]   Here you do these comparison shots where you can see same angle before and after.
[01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:36.600]   So this Mexico City today, the Aztec capital in the 1500s, what I liked about this, and
[01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:39.040]   this one's cool, the new fire ceremony.
[01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:42.440]   So the Aztec calendar is on a 52-year cycle.
[01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:46.360]   They would do this ceremony every 52 years to begin the new cycle.
[01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:50.040]   It's beautiful renders, historically well done.
[01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:55.840]   He got a lot of appreciation for this from people who studied this Aztec history.
[01:11:55.840 --> 01:11:57.680]   But this is a profile of slowness.
[01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:02.440]   It's something he thought would be worthwhile and interesting, and he just took his time
[01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:03.440]   to do it well.
[01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:04.600]   He did it on the side.
[01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:05.600]   It's not a business.
[01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:10.360]   He's not trying to crush it, not trying to hustle, not trying to build up followers.
[01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:14.240]   Just worked on this slowly, built up something that was beautiful and cool that he really
[01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:16.720]   liked and other people really liked as well.
[01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:19.800]   It took him almost two years.
[01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:21.840]   Slow productivity right there.
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:23.640]   There's no hustling here.
[01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:26.880]   There's no complicated organizational systems.
[01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:29.680]   He just took his time to produce something cool.
[01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:33.440]   He's pretty happy it's done, but that was probably also a really fulfilling two years
[01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:37.160]   just sitting there and working on this and making progress and seeing this thing that
[01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:38.640]   was important to you come to light.
[01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:41.840]   So anyways, I just wanted to show this because I love this type of thing.
[01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:48.120]   The slow pursuit of something cool can be just as rewarding as the fast pursuit of attention
[01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:51.840]   or clout or shallow achievement.
[01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:56.320]   Sometimes just taking your time to do something that feels worth doing can be one of the more
[01:12:56.320 --> 01:12:57.320]   fulfilling things.
[01:12:57.320 --> 01:13:01.720]   So we've got a case study here of a deep life intersecting with slow productivity, hitting
[01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:02.720]   all the buzzwords.
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:05.960]   He's probably used a lot of deep work to do this and he's a digital minimalist and got
[01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:08.040]   some career capital out of this as well.
[01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:13.560]   So Thomas, you've hit the bingo card, the Cal Newport bingo card, but well done with
[01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:14.560]   this project.
[01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:15.560]   I love this type of thing.
[01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:22.520]   I bet when my kids get older, I need to do something like this, I think.
[01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:25.000]   But for me, it's going to be-
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.000]   Richmond?
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.000]   Over the top.
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.160]   No, it's going to be over the top Halloween animatronics.
[01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:33.880]   It's going to be to the point where people are a little bit worried about me.
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:38.760]   That's going to be my version of this project, is over the top Halloween animatronics.
[01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:39.760]   But there's just something.
[01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:42.920]   I'm just working on this slowly for no other reason than I want to see my intentions being
[01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:45.100]   manifest concretely in the world.
[01:13:45.100 --> 01:13:46.100]   It's a cool way to do things.
[01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:47.640]   Anyways, Thomas, thanks for sharing that.
[01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:48.840]   Links in the show notes.
[01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:50.840]   That's all the time we have.
[01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:52.680]   Next week, I'm going to be in England.
[01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:57.640]   So you'll see I'm going to be playing an interview of an interview episode.
[01:13:57.640 --> 01:13:59.120]   It's actually me being interviewed.
[01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:00.120]   I think you'll like it.
[01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:03.520]   And then after that, we'll be back with another standard episode of the podcast.
[01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:05.340]   So see you in two weeks.
[01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:08.040]   And until then, as always, stay deep.
[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:13.360]   Hey, so if you like today's discussion of the way technology is hurting the professional
[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:19.520]   future of young people, I think you might also like episode 295, which is about artists
[01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:24.440]   who are revolting from social media.
[01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:25.440]   Check it out.
[01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:26.440]   I think you'll like it.
[01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:31.120]   We're going to talk about a quiet revolt against social media that seems to be circulating
[01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:32.720]   mainly among artists.
