[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.400]   - Welcome back on this Friday, Pastor John,
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.200]   back in June of 2021, right here on the podcast.
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.420]   You gave us a personal update from your life
[00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.480]   and at the very end of that update,
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.600]   it was like a little footnote that you added at the end.
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.640]   You briefly mentioned that you were about to head off
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.780]   for a two month writing leave to write a whole book
[00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.320]   about 2 Timothy 4, 8 on the second coming of Jesus Christ.
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.240]   And that was back in APJ 1641 that you told us about that.
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.520]   And in God's kindness, the book you alluded to there
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.620]   got written, edited and published
[00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.960]   and is now out under the title,
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.960]   "Come Lord Jesus, Meditations on the Second Coming of Christ."
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.720]   I'm holding the book in my hand right now
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.560]   and we are gonna look at the book over the next week or so
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.040]   on the podcast and four episodes of questions
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.280]   that I have for you.
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.120]   First off in this new book,
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.200]   what becomes pretty obvious to any reader
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.640]   is that you don't spend too much time
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.120]   dwelling on wrong views of the end times.
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.280]   Your goal really was to clarify what actually happens
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.960]   when Christ returns and to celebrate it
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.440]   and to encourage us to love his appearing.
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.000]   That's the main theme of the book, to love his appearing.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.600]   But I wonder if you'd be willing to take 10 minutes or so
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.480]   on this episode and sketch out for us
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.520]   some of the misconceptions, the blunders
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.000]   and the urban legends about the second coming
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.840]   that you hope your book will help people
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.680]   to avoid in the future.
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.480]   - In general, I do think it's right
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.640]   to do most good for the church,
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.120]   that we do most good for the church
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.680]   with regard to the second coming
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.680]   when we don't focus on distortions and misconceptions
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.240]   but rather on the truth and the beauty
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.480]   of what it really is in the Bible.
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.360]   And yet it's right now and then
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.360]   to make our people understand there are misconceptions,
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.240]   there are errors.
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.920]   And frankly, I'm really happy that my book is viewed
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.920]   as being mainly proactive and positive rather than critical.
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.480]   But of course, even that positive view can be overstated.
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.080]   If we never focus on what's wrong
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.680]   and show how harmful it is,
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.880]   we won't really be biblical
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.720]   because the biblical witness itself describes errors
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.520]   and their harmfulness like Jesus did
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.360]   with the scribes and Pharisees and Paul
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.560]   in exposing errors of false teaching
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.160]   in Colossians and other places.
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.760]   So yes, I am willing to point out some misconceptions
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.480]   about the second coming.
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.800]   And I'll name, I don't know how many I have listed here,
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.200]   but let's just take them one at a time.
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.420]   And I'll try to explain why I think they're a problem.
[00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.520]   First, I would mention the view
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.280]   that the second coming of Christ is far into the future.
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.080]   Let's have you far into the future.
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.060]   It will not happen until the kingdom of God is established
[00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.760]   as the ruling earthly power,
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.660]   including the Christianization of the cultures
[00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.840]   and societal structures of the earth.
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.760]   This is usually called post-millennialism,
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.020]   meaning that the second coming happens
[00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.300]   after or post the millennium.
[00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.340]   And the millennium in that view is understood
[00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.740]   to be an extended period in this age
[00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.820]   when the gospel has triumphed in such a way
[00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.860]   that a golden age of Christendom holds sway around the world
[00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.500]   and the powers of civil government, for example,
[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.980]   are brought into the service
[00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.500]   of promoting Christian doctrine.
[00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.260]   Now, I think this view does not adequately come to terms
[00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.780]   with both the teaching and the spirit of the New Testament
[00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.500]   that we are to live with a consciousness
[00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.980]   of the nearness of the coming of the Lord.
[00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.800]   I don't think it comes to terms adequately
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.620]   with the teaching of the New Testament
[00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.040]   concerning this present age
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.040]   as lying in the power of the evil one, 1 John 5 and 19,
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.740]   or how Paul describes this age
[00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:18.540]   till Jesus comes as this present evil age,
[00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.100]   Galatians 1, 4, or the statement in Hebrews,
[00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.660]   here we have no lasting city.
[00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.500]   We seek a city that is to come,
[00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.740]   or how the movement toward the end
[00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.680]   is described with a movement of greater evil,
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.860]   not less evil, 2 Timothy 3, 1 to 5.
[00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.620]   And practically, I think this view pushes the appearing
[00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.000]   of the Lord so far out into the distant future
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.260]   that it becomes inconsequential
[00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.740]   in the daily consciousness of the churches
[00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:56.900]   that embrace this view.
[00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.700]   And I think it skews the mission focus of the New Testament
[00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.740]   away from world evangelization and personal disciple-making
[00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.340]   and the process of sanctification.
[00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.860]   And so it reorients people's passions
[00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.860]   onto culture transformation as a foregrounded goal
[00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:22.020]   rather than a possible secondary consequence
[00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.940]   of speaking truth and doing love to the glory of Christ.
[00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.900]   And the reason I say a possible secondary consequence
[00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.900]   is that the culture is not the report card of the church.
[00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.180]   There is no New Testament promise
[00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.960]   that the church in this fallen age
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:48.220]   will transform any given culture.
[00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:52.100]   It may, it has, and it may not.
[00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:56.780]   It is as likely in any given setting
[00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:00.840]   that martyrdom, not transformation,
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.020]   will be the effect of obedience.
[00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.540]   And when that happens, the church has not failed.
[00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:08.900]   Just read the book of Revelation.
[00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.660]   Martyrdom is not failure.
[00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:11.580]   - Yeah.
[00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.260]   - Second, there is a view of the second coming
[00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.660]   that basically says it's already happened.
[00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.140]   For example, in the events of 70 AD
[00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:22.860]   when the Romans destroyed Jerusalem.
[00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.580]   And in that view, it's not a very common view, I admit,
[00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:31.060]   but in that view, the descriptions of his coming
[00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:35.580]   that sound globally visible and world-shaking and obvious
[00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:40.580]   were really just traditional apocalyptic language
[00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.420]   to say that the Lord comes in historical judgments
[00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.700]   in this age, and then he carries out
[00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:50.180]   for the rest of the time his rule over the world
[00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:51.980]   through the church with no expectation
[00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:54.220]   of any literal second coming at all.
[00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.360]   And I don't think the language of the New Testament
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.140]   that describes Christ's coming can be reduced
[00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:03.060]   to symbolic statements of historical events like 70 AD.
[00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:04.980]   Paul's understanding of the second coming
[00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:08.660]   in 1 Thessalonians 4 is that it involves
[00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:11.780]   the resurrection of all the Christians from the grave.
[00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:15.100]   That did not happen in 70 AD or at any time.
[00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:20.100]   It's going to happen when the Lord's appearing comes.
[00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:23.820]   Third, I think it's a mistake to say
[00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:29.940]   that there are no events that are yet to happen
[00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:33.280]   in history before the Lord comes.
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:39.300]   2 Thessalonians 2 describes an apostasy
[00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.920]   and the appearance of a man of lawlessness,
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.900]   and Paul gives these two realities as an answer
[00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:48.820]   to the question for those who thought
[00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:50.700]   that the day of the Lord was upon them.
[00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:54.780]   And he says in verse two of that chapter,
[00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:57.640]   let no one deceive you in any way,
[00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:03.620]   for that day will not come unless the rebellion comes first
[00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:06.860]   and the man of lawlessness is revealed,
[00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:08.260]   the son of destruction.
[00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.700]   So 2 Thessalonians 2.3.
[00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:14.100]   Fourth, perhaps the most common misconception
[00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:18.780]   of the second coming is that it happens in,
[00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:20.620]   so to speak, in two stages.
[00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:25.500]   First, he comes and he takes Christians out of the world
[00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:28.820]   and returns them to heaven with him
[00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:32.500]   while there's a great tribulation on the earth.
[00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:36.700]   And then after a short time, maybe seven years,
[00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:40.140]   he returns with his saints to establish his kingdom.
[00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:46.460]   Now that's one misconception I do deal with in the book.
[00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:51.320]   I devote a whole chapter to it, in fact.
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:54.060]   So I'm not going to go into any detail here.
[00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:59.060]   It is probably the most common misconception
[00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:00.820]   and people will be surprised.
[00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:02.580]   Whoa, I didn't know that was a misconception.
[00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:03.860]   That's what I've always believed.
[00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:05.820]   And I grew up with this view.
[00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:07.500]   My dad held this view.
[00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.900]   I love my dad to death to the day he died
[00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:11.140]   and we got along just fine.
[00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:16.060]   But gradually I came to see that this view
[00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:19.020]   did not have the Bible on its side.
[00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:22.620]   I think the primary danger of a view like this
[00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:26.700]   is not that it undermines any important doctrines,
[00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:30.580]   at least I'm not aware of anybody going off the rails
[00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:34.180]   in any fundamental way because they hold this view,
[00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:39.180]   but the danger is that it fosters the expectation
[00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:44.460]   that God will spare his people from suffering
[00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:46.540]   in the latter days.
[00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:48.140]   And I think that's a mistake
[00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:50.220]   and it could be a harmful mistake
[00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:52.620]   if people lost their faith
[00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:54.780]   because suddenly they found themselves
[00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.140]   enduring end time hardships
[00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:59.220]   that they thought they were going to escape.
[00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:04.020]   And I think 1 Peter 4 or 17,
[00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:07.300]   when it says, "It is time for judgment
[00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:10.040]   "to begin with the household of God.
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:12.320]   "And if it begins with us,
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.020]   "what will be the outcome of those
[00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:15.900]   "who do not obey the gospel of God?"
[00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:19.380]   I think he's showing in that statement
[00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:23.580]   that God's own people, the apple of his eye,
[00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:29.620]   experience some of the suffering of judgment,
[00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:34.620]   but we don't experience it as punishment.
[00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:37.180]   Christ took our punishment.
[00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:42.180]   We experience it as testing, proving, purifying us.
[00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:49.540]   Finally, I think it's a mistake to say
[00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:54.440]   what the skeptics did in 2 Peter 3, verse 3.
[00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:58.460]   "Where is the promise of his coming?
[00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:00.980]   "For ever since the fathers fell asleep,
[00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:03.900]   "all things are continuing the way they have been
[00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:06.460]   "from the beginning of creation."
[00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:08.780]   That's a quote from 2 Peter 3.
[00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:13.780]   In other words, it's a serious mistake, Peter says,
[00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:19.620]   to think, "Well, it's just been too long.
[00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:22.960]   "Everything just goes on.
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:25.640]   "He's just not coming.
[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:28.080]   "It was all a myth."
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.580]   That is a tragic mistake,
[00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:33.940]   and here's Peter's response to it.
[00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:35.900]   He says, next verse,
[00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:40.380]   "Do not overlook this one fact, beloved,
[00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:45.380]   "that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years,
[00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:48.740]   "and a thousand years as one day.
[00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:53.740]   "The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise
[00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:57.980]   "as some count slowness."
[00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:01.780]   Wow, what a response, as if he knew.
[00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:03.500]   Well, of course he knew.
[00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:05.860]   He would be asking his questions.
[00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:08.780]   So again, Tony, like I said at the beginning,
[00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:13.780]   I would much rather spend 300 pages in a book
[00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:17.040]   meditating on the beauty and the power
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:19.820]   and the wonder of what's really going to happen
[00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:23.980]   when the Lord comes than I would talking about mistakes.
[00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:26.280]   So that's what I tried to do in the book.
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:29.260]   The aim isn't mainly to correct errors.
[00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:34.140]   It's mainly to help people love the Lord's appearing.
[00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:35.700]   - Amen, yeah, it's not like any other book
[00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:36.540]   that I'm aware of.
[00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:38.100]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:41.060]   And that 2 Peter 3, verses three to four text
[00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:44.820]   reminds me of APJ 891, which we titled
[00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:47.380]   "The End Is Near, Are You Ready?"
[00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:49.000]   "The End Is Near, Are You Ready?"
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.700]   You can check that out if you want a good follow-up
[00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:52.420]   to today's episode.
[00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:53.740]   Thank you for joining us today.

[00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:05.300]   Well, Christ is coming back, and that means
[00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:08.660]   we need to go to church and we need to go to work.
[00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:10.260]   Pastor John, you're back with us on Monday
[00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.420]   to explain why the imminent return of Christ
[00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:15.300]   should get us to work and get us to church.
[00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:17.100]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:20.820]   We'll see you next week, and don't be skipping church.
[00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:21.780]   We'll see you then.
[00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:24.360]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.940]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:36.940]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
