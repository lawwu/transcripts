[00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.460]   My name is Joshua sheets. I am your host and today we have an expert interview
[00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.300]   I've had a massive list of guests that have been wanting to get on the show and
[00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.440]   With the vagaries of my current lifestyle. I haven't been able to line them up. But today
[00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.820]   We're gonna get started on that list
[00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:11.780]   [Music]
[00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:20.420]   Topic of privacy digital privacy financial privacy lifestyle privacy personal privacy. This is a topic that is certainly of
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:28.000]   Significant and I think growing interest in our modern world. I think many of us understand that the need for privacy
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.540]   especially in an increasingly
[00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.100]   Connected world can be significant and yet the question is how do you actually do it?
[00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.580]   And so today I've got Gabriel here with me to talk about this Gabriel. Welcome to radical personal finance. I'm glad you're here today, Joshua
[00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.940]   I'm very glad to be here. Let's let's do this
[00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:50.740]   I have found myself recommending your book quite a lot over the last couple of months has come up on the public podcast
[00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.660]   The cops are coming for us. You hear them
[00:01:53.660 --> 00:02:03.340]   It's come up on the on the podcast in public a couple of times and then I've also had that come up several times with
[00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.520]   With private consulting clients, etc. People who asked me said Josh
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:14.300]   I'm interested in privacy and I'm looking for something that's a little bit that that gives me kind of the the starter steps
[00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.280]   To get me started and it's it's actually hard to do
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.140]   I have a few favorites right on the one end. I often recommend to people who've never heard of privacy
[00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.140]   I recommend JJ Luna's book on
[00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:31.140]   How to be invisible there we go how to be invisible I blanked on the title because it's it's so beautifully written
[00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.260]   It's very attractive, but it's getting a little bit dated and out of it is out of date at this point on some of the techniques
[00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.060]   I really admire what Michael Bazzell has done with his work
[00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.780]   But it's so hardcore that it's hard for me to hand a 500 page book to someone expect them to read it
[00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.820]   And so I love your book because you are current on all of the cutting-edge strategies
[00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:55.020]   But you're writing them in an accessible way that I think is is much more useful. And so we're gonna talk
[00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.940]   extensively about some of the content of
[00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:04.580]   This book because I think it's a really worthy manual for somebody who's looking for one book
[00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:10.160]   I want to begin though today not by talking about techniques, but I want to ask you a question
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.300]   That's a burning question. I have and it's how to know how much is
[00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:22.700]   Enough. So let me articulate it with my own personal experience when I became interested in privacy as I'm want to do
[00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:28.300]   I went hardcore. I went as hard into the deep end as I could I tried on all the techniques
[00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:34.340]   I did the simple ones. I did the intermediate ones. I did the advanced ones and I found that my life was basically unlivable
[00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.660]   It was so frustrating to do it all I couldn't keep it up and I had to make conscious decisions
[00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:48.280]   To back off of some of the hardcore techniques because it was unlivable for me personally. It was costing me money
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.980]   It was costing me relationships. It was costing me business and I'll give you a practical example of
[00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.660]   How I have how this has been important to me
[00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.480]   A number of years ago when I got into privacy
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.300]   I started moving everybody away from contacting me on my phone on my phone
[00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:11.260]   To contacting me on an application and I set up a variety of different applications signal
[00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.980]   Wire whatsapp even Facebook. I used various phone voice over IP services
[00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.840]   At the time I was really enjoying using
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:26.740]   Pseudo and I had a plan all set up and I was doing this partly for international relocation
[00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.960]   but one of the things that happened to me when I relocated outside of the United States is
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:37.140]   Bunch of my systems broke because I put in foreign SIM cards and all of a sudden pseudo stopped working because I said
[00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.460]   Oh, we're not authorized and I found myself
[00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.200]   Isolated from people and at first I didn't realize this big problem
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.280]   But my friends who used to used to would have sent me a text message or used to
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.160]   Call me now just didn't do it because they didn't know well
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.200]   Do I use how do I reach Joshua?
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.580]   and so I actually had to make an intentional decision to go back to kind of the normal world of
[00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.220]   Having a phone number and texting people instead of sending the messages
[00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.060]   Because I found that my relationships were suffering because people didn't know how to get a hold of me
[00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:12.280]   So, how do you think about this this question of how much is enough as a privacy consultant?
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:17.000]   Well, Josh, I think that a lot of people who get into
[00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:24.100]   Privacy in a serious way have probably encountered this scenario. I know that I have I think for most people
[00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.800]   This is not a concern for them for most people maybe listening
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:33.520]   They're just finding the the first way to get into privacy they haven't gone off the deep end
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.620]   but
[00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.460]   What I will say is
[00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.580]   for most people
[00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.740]   You know, if you if you haven't touched on privacy at all
[00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:51.860]   I appreciate the recommendation for my book. That's definitely the place to start just to just to get your feet wet
[00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.300]   But I think a lot of people when they get into it, they do want to be the James Bond
[00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.300]   they want to be hardcore and
[00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.420]   your situation is a little bit different because you're
[00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:04.420]   You're going back and forth between countries a SIM card will really mess you up
[00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:09.060]   Especially if you're using a an app like I recommend my pseudo which is really tied into
[00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.760]   Where you are located. So my pseudo is is a serious challenge
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:19.580]   Although signal and wire and some of these others even whatsapp, they will work just fine and especially
[00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.580]   Work very well if you're if you're in different countries
[00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:30.200]   But what you do have to decide and I think it's it's a lot more important to have good relationships to have good business opportunities
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:36.980]   Then to be very private and so some people talk about threat modeling where you
[00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:43.340]   sort of set your priorities who are you trying to be private from and I
[00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.020]   Personally tend not to do threat modeling
[00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:49.820]   I feel like people should just go as far as they can as far as they feel comfortable
[00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:55.660]   But when you do feel that you are losing out on opportunities because people can't reach you
[00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.600]   because you are postponing the
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:05.860]   Dental filling because you don't want to go in there and confront them about giving your social security number. I'm not speaking from experience
[00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:11.020]   but you you can't you you have to make a determination at that point and
[00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:15.440]   what I what I will say is if you are in that boat just kind of
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:22.300]   experiments a little bit with it push it a little bit and then and then let it go and learn from that lesson and
[00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:27.300]   Maybe find an alternative do a little bit better the next time. So let's begin with
[00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:30.340]   discussion on digital privacy
[00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:33.880]   Because well, obviously there are different levels
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:38.780]   I think most of us some of the simplest steps that we could take that can dramatically improve our
[00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:45.460]   Personal privacy is in the area of digital privacy. Let's say that I come to you and I'm concerned about
[00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:49.900]   About the internet. It's not that I have anything going on
[00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:54.340]   I'm just someone who's saying well, I noticed that people are getting doxxed or I noticed that you know
[00:07:54.340 --> 00:08:00.020]   Something could happen and my information could be made public and that could be really concerning to me
[00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:06.100]   What are some of the basic steps that you think everyone should take with regard to digital privacy?
[00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:08.200]   well
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.200]   You should definitely be concerned about
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:14.020]   Digital and internet privacy even if you're not a public figure
[00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:16.820]   Obviously if you are some kind of public figure you should be very concerned
[00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:22.400]   I give examples in the introduction to my book about how these days if you apply for a job
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:26.040]   They might do a background check on you. They might check all of your social media
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:30.080]   There's one guy who posted on Twitter a 300 page document
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:34.340]   categorizing all of his social media posts by various
[00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:38.340]   Fouls basically and suffice to say this guy didn't get the job
[00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:43.620]   So there's an endless 300 page document was the hiring companies analysis of him, correct?
[00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:48.760]   And there are entire companies that do these background checks. And of course, there's a new there's a new industry
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:56.460]   Called open source intelligence and they are looking for all kinds of your information that's out there on the internet
[00:08:56.460 --> 00:09:01.400]   Whether that's for marketing whether that's just to give to law enforcement. There's all kinds of things that can go wrong
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:04.920]   So number one, there are a few things you can do and these are not very difficult
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.880]   First of all you advocate using a VPN
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:14.780]   Definitely pay for a VPN. There are a few good ones out there. You can check out proton VPN
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:19.960]   Express VPN is getting a little bit too big for its britches, but that's still very good
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:21.960]   You have more that you have a variety of these
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:26.680]   what you're really looking for is something that's paid and is therefore going to be reliable and
[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:30.480]   Something that is not logging your information a VPN will basically
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:37.360]   Make sure that your internet service provider whether you're at home and that's Cox or Xfinity or you're at the Starbucks
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.080]   down the road, they will not see your
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.480]   browsing activity
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:43.800]   and
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:48.720]   Likewise, if you go to Google or you go to some website, they are not going to
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:55.480]   See a recognizable IP address so there they won't be able to build up a dossier on you. So a VPN is
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:10:02.200]   Definitely the first thing that you should do number two, I would say definitely get into the private messaging
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:08.800]   Now you don't have to funnel everybody in your life into private messaging. One thing I do as I say
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:15.800]   Look close family. If you want to talk to me, this is where I'll be. I'll be on signal. I will be on wire
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:22.280]   I will be on session. Maybe even whatsapp whatsapp have some have some problems with it, but it's better than nothing
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:24.360]   It's still end-to-end encrypted. So I
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:29.520]   people cannot see whatsapp Facebook cannot see the content of your
[00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:34.340]   Conversation and your text but definitely get on to private messengers
[00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:39.580]   These are by and large free though. Of course, you want to donate to things like signal if you use them often
[00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:48.340]   So that's that's a big step. If you are messaging your girlfriend on Facebook, just tell her let's let's go to signal and and do that
[00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:50.060]   so VPNs
[00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:52.860]   private messaging, of course, I should have said this first which is to
[00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:55.620]   do more things offline and
[00:10:55.620 --> 00:11:02.360]   This is a difficult one most people when they want advice they want a list of okay
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:07.180]   What are all the services I should be using? What should I be paying for? How can somebody else give me privacy?
[00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:09.180]   and that's kind of a
[00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:10.500]   contradiction of
[00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:12.380]   What privacy is entirely?
[00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:19.000]   So you want to do fewer things online if you want privacy have have fewer accounts go
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:19.940]   first of all
[00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:26.140]   Go through your accounts and see what you all have out there and then start to go in there and get rid of the ones
[00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:28.140]   That you don't need
[00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:31.480]   Tone down social media. We'll get time. We'll get to that in a second
[00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:37.260]   I use a lot of I like to buy my books in print. I don't need
[00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:41.460]   Amazon seeing a list of how quickly I read on Kindle and
[00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:44.120]   What I'm interested in and what?
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:48.700]   Particular pages I focus on there's a lot of information they have on you
[00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:54.540]   So I just try to do more things in person buy more things in cash in person and to avoid
[00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:59.300]   Especially always online services. I prefer free and open source software
[00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:04.940]   So I don't use instead of an office 365, which is Microsoft's product now
[00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:10.220]   Where they're monitoring every keystroke. I just download in a Libra office and
[00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:15.540]   Sure, it takes there's a few different things, but I'm perfectly fine using Libra office
[00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:18.860]   It's a piece of software that is free and open source
[00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:25.700]   I can see everything that's going into it and it does not it's not connected to the Internet at all times. So just
[00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:31.060]   realize how much you are using the Internet and whether that's through your phone or
[00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:34.860]   Your entertainment or you just have all of these
[00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:42.120]   Even financial apps that are looking at what you're spending and and measuring
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:44.820]   I'm an advocate of going back to some of the
[00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:47.820]   physical
[00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:51.980]   Some of the physical methods and just doing a evaluation of
[00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:55.060]   Your Alliance on the Internet and cutting that down a little bit
[00:12:55.180 --> 00:13:00.700]   So I want to go back because I think if we're gonna approach this in a practical way, which is my intention
[00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:04.620]   probably the simplest place to start with privacy is
[00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:07.620]   publishing less I
[00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:11.020]   Think I don't want to gloss over what you said about social media
[00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:17.420]   It's astonishing the personal details that we share in a very public format
[00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:21.860]   And there are things that perhaps we know about hey, I'm on vacation right now for years
[00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:28.900]   That has been something that thoughtful police officers have warned people against don't post I'm on vacation. Don't post your vacation photos
[00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:32.460]   Because someone can easily track down your house and target it
[00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:39.340]   I don't know that it happens that much but it certainly does happen and it's fairly easy for it to happen in a modern world
[00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:42.540]   especially if your social media posts are in your
[00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:46.780]   Your legal name if you have a legal name, that's John Smith
[00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:53.500]   and you know that you're on vacation and I can go to your town and if your profile says where you live and I can
[00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:54.580]   go to your
[00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:59.580]   County recorders I can find your address and I know there's a pretty good chance that that house is unoccupied
[00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:02.780]   If you're actively posting photos when you're on vacation
[00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:07.620]   So I think you can minimize output with regard to social media to your point
[00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:11.460]   posting on social media is is a
[00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:17.660]   Significant risk for most people because the post that seems innocuous to you
[00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:22.140]   May be the post that eventually undoes your whole career
[00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:27.780]   I think the best example that I like to point to this was is Justine Sacco many years ago
[00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:33.100]   She was the lady who was flying to Africa and she posted a poorly worded joke
[00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:38.260]   But she was just making a joke and it was intended to be a form of self-deprecating humor
[00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:42.180]   Where she was pointing out that she was privileged and yet the joke was badly
[00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:48.500]   Misinterpreted and when she was on an airline flight her entire life unraveled because of a post she made on Twitter and we see this
[00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:56.460]   again and again and again where somebody posts something and they word it poorly and yet it winds up backfiring on them and
[00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:59.340]   So one simple strategy is post less. I
[00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:04.420]   Personally am NOT particularly skilled at the use of humor or sarcasm
[00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:08.180]   Especially in 240 characters or 280 characters
[00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:12.420]   And so I've tried to cut pull back from that because I don't do well in that format
[00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:19.340]   And I think that in a modern world of social media can actually be a competitive advantage for you to have fewer posts
[00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:25.420]   Do you think if you go for a job? Do you think an employer is suspicious if you don't have a social media presence?
[00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:29.300]   So yes, yes, they might be suspicious
[00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:35.100]   But they will just have to live with that now if you do find that
[00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:38.560]   Your employers and you're trying to get a job are suspicious
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:44.420]   You might keep your Facebook account and your social media and just pare it down
[00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:52.140]   So let's go into my my number four point then which is to tone down social media. Everything that you've said is is correct
[00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:56.020]   What you post on social media can cost you your job
[00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:59.300]   It can cost you I believe here's a
[00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:01.940]   statistic
[00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:03.580]   31/3 of all
[00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:04.620]   divorce
[00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:11.220]   Hearings meant use the word Facebook in them. So there's all kinds of reasons why you might want to tone down the social media
[00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:16.600]   I'm not trying to ruin people's fun here. But what if you had a social media account and it wasn't your name
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:19.980]   It was your initials. What if you did not make it publicly available?
[00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:23.660]   What if you made sure that you were not tagged in your posts?
[00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:28.780]   What if you didn't use geolocation so people didn't know exactly where you were?
[00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:31.380]   what if you
[00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:33.540]   decided to
[00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:40.300]   Communicate with your followers or your friends outside of that social media on one of the private encrypted
[00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:44.220]   Messengers that we just discussed there are all kinds of ways to tone this down
[00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:46.060]   and
[00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:53.380]   Let's not forget that Facebook and a lot of these companies are using your images and they're using your text or AI and facial
[00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:57.980]   Recognition and all these kind of things that could be used later on in unsavory ways
[00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:01.580]   And of course we have all the stuff happening with kovat
[00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:05.340]   If you say X Y or Z that could absolutely
[00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:10.020]   There's all kinds of examples we could point to cost you your job cost you all kinds of things
[00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:12.060]   So tone down the social media
[00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:17.940]   I'm not I'm not saying to ruin your fun by doing that but there you can certainly do less
[00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:22.700]   You don't have to have your own photo on there. Just have a fun photo of a cat or something
[00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:26.500]   It doesn't have to be your face. You can interact with the people you want to interact with
[00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:28.300]   and
[00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:30.880]   But and say the witty things that you want to say
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:36.680]   But in a more pared down and thoughtful way and if you need examples of what can happen to you social media
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:42.580]   Just go to Amazon look at the first introduction of my book, which you can see for free. You'll get a list of many examples
[00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:48.140]   Tell us your favorite story. What's the one that usually is super surprising to people?
[00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:53.140]   Well, here's a here's a good example. So a guy I think he's a
[00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:59.140]   He was a he was a jeweler. I believe like a jeweler rapper kind of figure
[00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:05.060]   He was in Miami and he posts a photo of all of his bling spread out on his hotel bed
[00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:09.180]   well surprise surprise he goes out for the night and he comes back and his
[00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:13.180]   Room has been busted into and all of his stuff has been taken
[00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:18.300]   So of course thieves unsavory people saw that he posted it
[00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.460]   They knew he was in Miami because he said so
[00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:26.620]   so it was a matter of looking at the photos seeing where he might be calling around to a few hotels using a little bit of
[00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:29.380]   social engineering
[00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:35.680]   Discovering where he was and then breaking in there and and taking I think it was millions of dollars worth of his stuff
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:38.460]   so just one one small example of
[00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:44.340]   Of how you're not thinking about these things can come back to bite you pays to be thoughtful
[00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:46.500]   I think that my only comment is I
[00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:53.340]   I pared down my social media use when I got into privacy. I actually deleted a couple of my accounts
[00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:56.060]   And I regretted
[00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:58.340]   Isn't I regretted some of the deletions?
[00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:04.940]   But that was largely because I make money from my social media and it provides a valuable
[00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:08.820]   Way for me to keep in contact with my listeners. And so I
[00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:13.860]   Reestablished after fully deleting several of my accounts. I reestablished
[00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:21.360]   Several of my accounts and got them back because I realized that I needed them and I wanted them and I genuinely
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:26.340]   Appreciated them for their ability to influence my business
[00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:32.540]   And so my number one thing is if you're not making money with social media, then you should seriously consider just dumping it
[00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:36.260]   But I do understand kind of an in-between area
[00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:39.500]   it's hard to say that there is a
[00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:42.060]   It's hard to say that there is a positive
[00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:48.300]   Benefit for most people from social media the way that most people use it. My observation is that more people are angry
[00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:52.260]   They feel the the data is pretty clear that people are angry
[00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:59.020]   They're upset about the arguments that invade their life on a daily basis. Many people are upset. They feel less worthy
[00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:05.340]   They lack self-confidence because they see other people's continual flow of peak moments and they don't understand that
[00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:08.460]   Those are just peak moments even if you know it intellectually
[00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:13.460]   It feels like everyone else is sitting on a beach with a cocktail in their hand having a great old time with all their good
[00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:19.820]   Looking friends and here I am poor little old me dumpy old me sitting at home alone lonely right now. It's it's just not
[00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:28.780]   Overall productive unless you're using it to make money. One thing I've never regretted doing though is simply deleting past history
[00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:36.020]   On Twitter. This is the easiest I run tweet delete and I've been on Twitter since 2008
[00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:40.460]   But I have it set up various times where just automatically deletes all tweets older than a month
[00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:44.660]   You can set it where it's older than six months older than a year. I removed
[00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:51.420]   Over a decade worth of history from Facebook back when there was a Facebook tool that allowed me to do it fairly easily
[00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:55.140]   Facebook no longer allows that tool to work
[00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:58.820]   But they do offer more ability to archive things
[00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:06.220]   I've deleted a huge amount of history from all the other ones and that's always felt better because I
[00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:11.980]   Don't have any skeletons in my younger closet. I didn't say I didn't post racist stuff online
[00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:15.580]   I didn't do anything particularly scandalous and whatnot
[00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:22.540]   But still what you realize is that the person that I was is not the person that I am and while for my own records
[00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:27.620]   It's nice to sometimes go back and say hey, who am I now? And and what do I know now?
[00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:32.660]   I don't necessarily want to be judged by the person that I was back then
[00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:37.580]   So I think that even if you do have if you do have something that you're ashamed of in the past get rid of it
[00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:44.180]   Now before you're applying for something but even not I I just appreciate being able to be in the moment and not being so tied
[00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:52.100]   To my past. Do you have any great tools for people who want to kind of simplify their previous life without actually deleting accounts all the way
[00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:55.100]   Yeah, I don't know that
[00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:58.380]   Particular tools for social media come to mind
[00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:03.060]   I'm a big proponent of just making your own list and doing things manually
[00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:06.820]   But tweet delete that sounds like a that sounds like a good tool
[00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:11.340]   I was going to say when you when you say that you don't have skeletons in the closet
[00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:14.700]   I think that people who ten years ago said that
[00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:18.380]   There were two sexes right might these days
[00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:25.860]   Come to regret that and it might even be illegal in certain countries to say that by hate speech laws
[00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:29.240]   so you never know the the way that the
[00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:31.300]   winds
[00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:38.660]   Will be going and so you are you are correct and and right to want to keep control of that
[00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:43.380]   But I do want to speak to a demographic of your audience who is probably
[00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:50.780]   budding entrepreneurs people who are starting up businesses and when they go to YouTube when they when they listen to the podcast, they're told that
[00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:53.580]   they need to
[00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:59.420]   Be on all platforms and they need to be engaged with their audience and they need to be on Facebook and Instagram and all these
[00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:01.420]   Places I'm not saying that's not true
[00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:05.140]   But in my experience and I think this is something that you've done as well
[00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:10.260]   Joshua is if you have a very good product and you put it on enough places
[00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:17.580]   You will you will get a following and I think that some entrepreneurs go a little bit too far
[00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:23.420]   They think that they have to be everywhere that they have to reveal every part of their life that they have to treat their audience
[00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:25.180]   buddy, buddy
[00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:28.500]   But I know I know people who have done well by
[00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:34.460]   by not advertising by not being on social media in that kind of pronounced way and so
[00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:40.980]   You know, if you put your podcast on Spotify and Apple, that's most people right there. You put it on YouTube
[00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:47.060]   You put it you create a patreon account. You're probably doing pretty well. And if you have a good thing it it will get noticed
[00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:49.580]   and just a
[00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:53.340]   just some thoughts on the entrepreneurs out there who
[00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:59.420]   Are told that they need to be on social media. Maybe that's not the case. Let's switch to
[00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:03.420]   financial privacy you talked briefly about
[00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:09.420]   Spending privacy, which I think is some of the simplest areas to ways to be private
[00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:12.820]   first make the case as to why somebody
[00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:20.500]   it's always easy to say I've got nothing to hide and we are without question fully agreed that
[00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:25.020]   Saying we've got nothing to hide and actually having nothing to hide
[00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:30.680]   Are two different things right the the quote we were talking earlier. You said the quote
[00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:32.940]   Do you remember who to attribute it to?
[00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:34.500]   Cardinal Rishalu
[00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:40.500]   He says that give me six lines from the hand of the most honest of men and I will find something in them
[00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:42.500]   Which will hang him. Yeah, so
[00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:47.260]   Yeah, you're right that you don't know. Well, let's let's let's give one example
[00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:51.500]   There's a lot of Americans listening one in 20 of you are going to spend time in jail
[00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:55.300]   That's just how our justice system is in this country
[00:24:55.300 --> 00:25:01.300]   We incarcerate a lot of people or the United States incarcerates a lot of people and so you have your Christmas gathering here
[00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:02.580]   And you have 20 of your family in there
[00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:07.740]   one of them is going to or has spent time in jail and so the way it works is you might go to a
[00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:08.740]   jury and
[00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:16.860]   Maybe if the attorney and the judge are a little bit tech savvy they might for example want to subpoena your your Amazon
[00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:23.820]   Shopping list. I think that would be something that I would push for because your Amazon shopping list tells a lot about you
[00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:28.080]   Let's say that they go to the Amazon shop list and they see that you're into
[00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:35.980]   Hardcore privacy or that you bought a Glock holster or X Y & Z now imagine how an attorney could spin that in a particular way
[00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:42.300]   So that an emotional jury could change their verdict based on what they find just one example about how?
[00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:46.140]   Being more careful in this case. You have an Amazon account
[00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:50.060]   There there ways we can we can talk about to to hide your Amazon purchases
[00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:50.340]   Of course
[00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:52.340]   The best way is simply to buy more things in person
[00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:57.420]   Especially sensitive things buy things in person with cash as opposed to buying them online
[00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:02.760]   But just one small example of how it can cost you and always practice kovat safety when you're doing that, right?
[00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:05.660]   Oh extra extra large mass for extra
[00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:07.500]   social responsibility
[00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:14.300]   Exactly. Exactly. So, how do you let's go let's talk about spending money privately. So the simplest way is
[00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:21.580]   You pull out physical currency you go to a place that has what you want. You make sure to wear your kovat mask
[00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:29.260]   for good protection of your fellow shoppers, and of course it has a side benefit of providing a little bit more privacy from all the
[00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:30.780]   cameras and
[00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:37.540]   You simply buy it that's obvious. But what if it's not that simple? What if there's something that's only available on Amazon?
[00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:40.780]   What if it's a digital product? How do you protect your privacy and buy things privately?
[00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:46.460]   Yeah, let me let me speak to cash really quickly. What what you said is true, and I think people
[00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:50.460]   Intellectually understand that but they don't go about doing that
[00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:55.500]   so if you believe in privacy and you don't want to live in a world where there are central bank digital currencies and
[00:26:55.500 --> 00:27:00.740]   the Federal Reserve is dictating what you can and can't purchase or where visa recently is
[00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:04.420]   setting limits on the carbon emissions of particular
[00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:07.760]   Purchase or they're talking about this about the particular purchase you buy
[00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:13.260]   Then you are a big proponent of cash and you want a cash culture and you want to fight against the war on cash
[00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:16.100]   So I would advocate anybody who's listening who believes in this stuff
[00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:20.420]   Seriously, stop the credit cards as much as you can take out cash
[00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:24.940]   Go to a bank that lets you that has a that has a high limit of taking out cash
[00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:27.380]   Stockpile some cash be careful how you
[00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:30.700]   How much you take with you where you put it hide it
[00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:36.060]   I have some suggestions for that in my book and then use it use more cash, please for
[00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:42.900]   For the good of your fellow man good of your fellow man, please use more cash now, obviously some things you have to buy online
[00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:50.280]   And I have some maybe more controversial chapters sections in my book about how to acquire things for free online
[00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:52.980]   We can talk about that only if you want to Joshua
[00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:57.900]   You can acquire all kinds of things for free online and make it up to the company in in various ways
[00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:04.020]   But for that thing on Amazon or wherever that you want to buy, of course Americans have
[00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:06.500]   privacy.com
[00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:08.620]   Which is one option now privacy.com
[00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:11.620]   Very popular. It's highly recommended
[00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:16.820]   The basically here's how this works. You set up an account with privacy.com
[00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:22.100]   I'm sure the audience actually now that I think about it knows because Josh you talked about this you set up the account you attach
[00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:27.300]   Your bank account. Alright, so there's no privacy that privacy.com knows what's going on here
[00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:30.860]   But the merchants in this case does not know
[00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:37.880]   So if you want to buy the poop hurry online and have it shipped to your house or not to your house
[00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:43.900]   In this case, you can use a privacy.com debit card, which you can create on the fly
[00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:45.500]   You can put whatever name you want
[00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:50.300]   You can put whatever address and billing address you want and it will it should go through
[00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:52.220]   So that's kind of how privacy.com works
[00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:59.280]   It allows you to hide your personal information from the merchants from the merchants and as well as from your bank because it will just say
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:07.740]   Transaction from privacy.com. That's one small way and an easy way and this is a free service because privacy.com makes their money
[00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:10.460]   as part of the as part of the
[00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:14.100]   Card fees so it's actually a free service
[00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:19.840]   So privacy.com is a way use as many gift cards as you can you can buy gift cards in cash
[00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:22.500]   this is a great way to
[00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:27.980]   Get all kinds of stuff online whether that's eBay eBay has gift cards or Amazon
[00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:30.420]   and
[00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:32.100]   That's a that's also a great way
[00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:37.900]   Of course if you really want your privacy then you're going to have to create a new Amazon account to use this gift card
[00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:40.220]   That is not attached to some of your personal information
[00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:46.420]   Let me just throw out kind of extreme scenario here of how to buy something privately on Amazon
[00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:53.360]   You would go to a public Wi-Fi spot. Let's say a Starbucks create a new Amazon account
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:57.780]   Put a small gift card onto it. Not a big one a small one
[00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:02.620]   Test that out with a very small purchase send that to a delivery place like a Whole Foods
[00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:05.860]   And this is how you train your account Amazon's becoming a little bit more
[00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:10.500]   Cracked down about how they how they view these kind of transactions
[00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:13.900]   So you'll have trained your account at that point if you wanted to you could just use
[00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:19.160]   Amazon gift cards purchase things and have them sent to a Whole Foods you arrive at the Whole Foods. I
[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:21.980]   Like a little sticky note. I approach from the side
[00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:26.560]   I cover the camera at the Whole Foods drop-off and I pick up my stuff and I'm on my way
[00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:33.160]   So just a couple examples we can pivot whichever direction you want. I know that was going a little bit extreme for a second there
[00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:39.520]   well, it's it's an interesting thing because I've I've tested and done some of this stuff and I
[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:47.540]   Consider myself a privacy enthusiast, but these are some of the things that I have discovered are a
[00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:55.940]   Step too far for me based upon the benefits for my life. So I've I've done this
[00:30:56.660 --> 00:31:02.780]   But I have discovered from several years of living without Amazon. I've discovered that
[00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:06.660]   Amazon is a major quality of life
[00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:12.300]   Improvement for me. In fact when my wife and I were talking about moving back to the United States
[00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:18.660]   We're talking about the benefits of why we would want to move back to the United States on the top three list was Amazon
[00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:22.060]   Because you it's such an amazing, you know
[00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:29.920]   Same day next day two days here comes the product as any product in the world shows up to my door. It's high quality
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:35.660]   I can see the reviews. It's just fabulous and for me and my family went three years and really didn't buy
[00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:36.660]   Well, excuse me
[00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:41.540]   We bought very little on Amazon because we were traveling who didn't want to wait for the boxes, etc
[00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:45.260]   And but what we would do is it was such a big deal that whenever we came to the United States
[00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:51.520]   We'd wind up with thousand fifteen hundred dollar Amazon orders to pick up and go home with bulging suitcases
[00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:53.700]   so what I wonder here is
[00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:59.620]   for the people who are so there's the hardcore guys like you who will go all the way and
[00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:05.340]   I believe that's the ideal but in this case maybe a good way to do it is
[00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:11.540]   First to say to someone think do it at least a couple of times because here's what I'm trying to articulate
[00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:16.620]   I have pulled back on privacy, but I'm glad that I have tested the things that I've done
[00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:22.660]   And so knowing how to do it if you need to do it is I think better than not knowing how to do it and never
[00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:28.460]   Having done it. So maybe for the in-between people you might maintain most of your Amazon stuff
[00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:34.620]   But it's fairly innocuous the fact that you order a certain brand of diapers for your child and that's on subscribe and save
[00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:39.180]   But practice setting up something and practice ordering things not
[00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:41.420]   Not anything that you're actually concerned about
[00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:46.760]   So that you have the skills of knowing how to do it in case the time comes when you might want to buy
[00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:48.380]   Something else for example
[00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:54.420]   I think for me the biggest thing that would be concerning if it were exposed for me personally as my library
[00:32:54.420 --> 00:33:01.060]   Because I read a huge amount and you could take any number of dozens and dozens of books in my library
[00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:06.180]   And you put those on a big screen with a lawyer and I'd be shocked
[00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:08.700]   I'd be scared stiff of what he could say about Joshua
[00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:12.100]   But anybody who knows Joshua knows that this is just Joshua
[00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:18.260]   So I refuse to buy books on Amazon for this reason, but I don't mind buying a lot of other stuff
[00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:22.540]   So maybe there's a balance that someone could integrate. Yeah, and I think of
[00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:28.180]   Somebody who may be the listeners are aware of Doug Casey. He recently
[00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:35.020]   Published a novel called assassin where he where he defends that practice. So of course if you have that on well
[00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:39.620]   That was after drug lord. That was after the what was the first one in the series?
[00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:42.180]   Speculating. Yes
[00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:46.580]   So yes, there's you're correct about this. So how about this? I
[00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:51.860]   did advocate a very hardcore strategy if you get a privacy.com account and
[00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:58.340]   You I have I have plenty of Amazon accounts. They use privacy.com card
[00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:00.500]   fairly simple
[00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:02.820]   Don't use my real name. Okay, great
[00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:10.820]   And you could send them either to a UPS box or to an Amazon drop-off location in that scenario
[00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:15.700]   What does Amazon know about you? They don't know your name. They don't know your address
[00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:20.880]   They don't really know anything about you. And so a subpoena could draw these things together
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:27.460]   But Amazon in that case doesn't know anything about you. So that's a less hardcore way of going about it
[00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:33.240]   Start start small, but I agree it can be important to and fun sometimes to push this all the way
[00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:39.400]   But some of this stuff just you have to sit down think about okay. What does this company know about me?
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:41.920]   What do I not want them to know and how can I get around that?
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:48.120]   Sometimes the solutions are fairly straightforward if you know some of the right tools privacy.com for instance
[00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:50.480]   All right. We talked about spending money
[00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:53.840]   What about
[00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:59.960]   Making money. What are the suggestions or thoughts you have about privately generating money?
[00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:04.440]   Yeah, this is a this is a topic of course that this show is all about
[00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:09.920]   Of course if you are self-employed then you are doing privacy correctly. We
[00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:12.160]   were talking about
[00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:19.760]   Being employed earlier in this episode and if you're getting a job these days, of course, you have to give your information to that company
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:21.240]   You will have to
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:24.480]   Give your social security number in the United States at the point of employment
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:29.200]   I wouldn't give it before then you might have to be part of that company's LinkedIn page
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:33.400]   You might have to give them your photo. You might have to post on your personal account various things
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:36.640]   you might have to use that company's equipment, which is
[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:41.960]   by the way, be careful about mixing the the personal in the business always have your
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:44.640]   business device separate if that were the case
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:50.760]   But there's all kinds of exposing thing if you are exposing things if you are an employee if you are self-employed
[00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:53.160]   Of course, you don't have to give out that information
[00:35:53.480 --> 00:36:00.040]   You do business and you have a bank account in a name of your creation and that LLC or that business?
[00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:03.040]   Should be a fairly innocuous name that does not tie
[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:10.760]   Tie things to you. And so when you have that you have the vehicle to acquire money privately now, how can you do that?
[00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:13.960]   Well, I would suggest going back and listening to all the episodes that
[00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:18.360]   Joshua talks about in my experience. I'll just kind of boil it boil it down
[00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:23.480]   You obviously have something to offer the world because you do that right now as a job
[00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:26.920]   You probably also have some kind of hobby that people would be interested in knowing
[00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:34.480]   so find a way to offer that service or offer that perspective in a very compelling way and
[00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:40.800]   starts to approach people get clients get some kind of a web presence and
[00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:43.240]   If you have the right work ethic
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:48.800]   And you follow some of the basic advice about there out there about how to be an entrepreneur
[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:54.520]   You can have more clients and not be as vulnerable to the single client
[00:36:54.520 --> 00:37:00.680]   Who is your boss when you are employed? I think that that's a key idea
[00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:06.120]   I mean there's there are diminishing returns on business privacy and privately generating income
[00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:11.440]   There are some people for whom their ability to to generate income privately is literally a matter of life and death
[00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:14.880]   It's protecting them from from people who are tracking them down
[00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:20.840]   but for most of us it's not that big of a deal, but when you combine the lifestyle benefits and you combine the
[00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:25.600]   when you combine the lifestyle benefits you combine some of the
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:31.960]   Career benefits when you combine some of the security that can be had and then you add privacy on top of it
[00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:37.080]   it can be a compelling factor for many people to be able to generate money privately and
[00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:41.240]   It's I
[00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:45.440]   Thing I'm most passionate about is just simply helping people support their families
[00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:50.360]   There are a lot of people who if they couldn't generate income privately, especially through self-employment
[00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:54.880]   They're their children wouldn't eat because they don't have the right papers. They don't have the right permissions
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:57.960]   They're not the don't have the right, you know working documents
[00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:04.920]   and so the ability to generate money privately is a big big deal to a man's ability to feed himself and feed his children and
[00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:12.120]   It's important for all of us to maintain that and to help encourage the ability that people have to generate income privately
[00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:14.800]   yes for sure, I'll just
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:18.560]   talk a little bit for a second about the mechanics because I
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:22.560]   left that out, let's say for example you have a
[00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:28.080]   Service that you want to offer somebody you're a plumber and you quit your company and you want to be your own plumber
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:31.000]   I don't know all the qualifications and certifications and all the rest
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:35.200]   so maybe that's not a good example, but what you can do is create a
[00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:40.320]   Bitcoin wallet for example with Electrum and you can give out one of the addresses
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:45.360]   To your clients and they can pay you in Bitcoin. You don't have to have a bank account in that case
[00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:48.720]   There could be various reporting requirements, etc
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:51.880]   If you wanted to be in full compliance of the IRS, etc
[00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:55.640]   But that's a very simple thing you can do in a matter of minutes to be able to
[00:38:55.640 --> 00:39:04.140]   Get money in the form of Bitcoin from a service that you offer. So things are getting increasingly easy for people to get money
[00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:08.980]   All right, you have crossed you have just crossed the magic
[00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:12.540]   barrier that I was going next is into
[00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:17.700]   Bitcoin and I want to spend a good amount of time here because I think this is some of the most important area for us
[00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:23.200]   To focus on as far as the opportunities that are available to us and then actually practically how to do it
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:28.500]   I'm deeply invested in this because as I see it the biggest impediments right now to
[00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:31.260]   privacy in the financial space are
[00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:36.780]   Banks and various financial institutions who?
[00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:45.100]   Number one our data hogs like they love to suck up your data in order for there to be
[00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:52.980]   Giant repositories of information for more effective marketing and while I respect the hustle, I don't want to be in it
[00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:56.760]   Number two is the fact that they're all spies
[00:39:56.900 --> 00:40:03.460]   All right, any person any person who is affiliated with the financial institution any financial advisor any banker?
[00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:07.900]   They're all spies. I used to be one too all unpaid spies for
[00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:10.420]   the federal government and
[00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:14.620]   That there's just this culture of a lack of privacy. Although there are
[00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:18.040]   Properly enforced consumer financial laws
[00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:22.300]   I could make some arguments as to why bank secrecy in the United States is actually pretty good
[00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:25.780]   And I think those are fair arguments. It is a big is a big deal
[00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:30.340]   And and when you get into the world of banking, it's as I as I concern it as I see it
[00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:35.460]   It's one of the biggest issues that we face right now where your individual transactions are
[00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:37.500]   compiled
[00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:42.500]   organized collated for marketing purposes across various credit cards, etc
[00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:47.700]   And what's more important is that your transactions themselves are being scrutinized?
[00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:51.140]   By institutions who have no idea what's happening
[00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:56.100]   If you make a transaction with the wrong person you buy the wrong thing you wind up on a blacklist
[00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:58.040]   It's a major major concern
[00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:01.420]   so I'd like to take a few moments before we get into Bitcoin and
[00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:05.260]   Just ask you like how do you see the financial space?
[00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:11.180]   Tell some some stories or share some of the the depth of the the market data
[00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:17.020]   That's being collected and compiled based upon the simple act of opening a bank account or swiping a credit card
[00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:19.060]   Yeah, sure
[00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:24.420]   So I think most people are have a sense of what's going on in banking
[00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:29.940]   of course post 9/11 in places like the US and consequently in other places, especially the
[00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:37.860]   14 eyes countries who are it's basically a spy surveillance network of various countries and you have
[00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:43.100]   You have the five eyes nations, Australia, Canada, New Zealand
[00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:47.100]   UK and the United States and they're sharing a lot of this information and so
[00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:51.820]   Yes, there is all kinds of information being gathered by
[00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:58.020]   Banks and financial institutions. We just saw recently in the last month in the last few months and you've talked about this Josh
[00:41:58.020 --> 00:42:00.020]   the
[00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:02.380]   bar being suggested to be lowered for
[00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:08.160]   Transactions reported to the IRS. I can't recall did that did that what was the
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:15.640]   Conclusion to that pass didn't pass didn't pass but you can see it is certainly in the zeitgeist and so
[00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:18.700]   Here's the facts
[00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:25.740]   Anytime well, first of all, you have your money in a bank and I like to talk about self-sufficiency and as well as privacy
[00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:32.500]   You have your money in the bank and the bank essentially is the owner of that money. I don't like that
[00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:35.680]   That's why I like to hold as much cash in person as I can
[00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:42.800]   and when I hold more cash in person that not only gives me ownership, but it also gives me privacy because I am NOT sending
[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:44.580]   that cash out to
[00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:47.920]   That money out to various people and places now
[00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:54.500]   Let's talk about some of the information being gathered on you. Of course if you're using a visa card
[00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:57.460]   Chase visa card whoever the company is
[00:42:57.460 --> 00:43:03.500]   They're collecting all kinds of marketing data people love to use their credit cards because they think that
[00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:06.680]   They're getting 5% back or whatever
[00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:11.620]   I think some of the studies show that people's depend on average 10% more when they use a credit card
[00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:15.660]   So I don't think in the end that you're winning in that
[00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:23.220]   In one of the greatest marketing campaigns in human history the the credit card and they're of course gathering all this all this information
[00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:24.700]   and
[00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:32.300]   Chase knows that you bought that gun at that store last week and this information is
[00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:34.700]   a
[00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:40.260]   Record of your life your interests where you were who you were with and
[00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:44.180]   In the same way we talked about the jury earlier on
[00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:47.940]   Chase can see your
[00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:52.860]   purchases on Amazon and everything and all of your other purchases
[00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:59.620]   So it is not a system that I want to be a part of I use more cash and you can use cryptocurrency
[00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:04.020]   Which is I think the direction that we're going. All right, so let's talk about cryptocurrency
[00:44:05.660 --> 00:44:12.460]   Bitcoin is totally secret right once what I spend out of my Bitcoin wallet is totally secret, right?
[00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:19.700]   Absolutely, Josh. So if if you were to send me some Bitcoin I could click on your wallet to see how
[00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:22.900]   Wealthy you are in terms of Bitcoin see
[00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:26.260]   Who else and everybody you have ever paid?
[00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:30.540]   Possibly where you were when you paid them if I was a little bit more savvy
[00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:35.820]   And of course the IRS can tell that and more and all of these open-source intelligence gatherers
[00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:40.980]   Can also see a whole lot more so Bitcoin the idea of Bitcoin is that there's no central authority
[00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:43.380]   which means that everybody is the authority and
[00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:50.580]   The way that works is you have a public ledger, right the blockchain and this documents
[00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:57.860]   Every transaction that occurs so that the entire Bitcoin community is verifying the transaction. They are the authority
[00:44:57.860 --> 00:45:00.820]   So we don't have a central authority. Okay, fantastic. Great
[00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:07.220]   But that also means that you can go back and analyze and study and see all of the connections
[00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:11.560]   How much Bitcoin is in each wallet all this kind of information? It's not
[00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:20.020]   Private in that sense, but you can make it private if when somebody traces it back it comes back to nothing
[00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:22.860]   So that obviously I'm joking
[00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:28.780]   But I think that it's often misunderstood that people think that well because people have used Bitcoin to buy drugs and it's all private
[00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:34.700]   It's actually far more public in terms of the transaction data. It's far more public than anything else
[00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:39.380]   It's far more public than a credit card transaction is in terms of publicness
[00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:44.700]   But that doesn't mean that there aren't ways to to use it privately
[00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:49.740]   So let's say that I did want to interact more with Bitcoin because I find it
[00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:52.900]   Doesn't matter why let's say that I wanted to
[00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:55.700]   transact more with Bitcoin
[00:45:55.700 --> 00:45:58.060]   what are some of the ways to
[00:45:58.060 --> 00:46:04.600]   Acquire and use Bitcoin in a more private way to support the growth of the Bitcoin
[00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:08.820]   Environment for whatever reason is important to you
[00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:14.260]   That is really the correct question and one that almost nobody
[00:46:14.260 --> 00:46:19.020]   Asks when I get into Bitcoin most people they're told to get into Bitcoin
[00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:25.660]   I think for the wrong reasons because they're told that it's going up and it will never go down and that's probably not the right reason
[00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:28.940]   And so people typically say well, yeah get a coinbase account or something like that
[00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:34.660]   well, the idea of Bitcoin is that there's no central authority that you own your thing and
[00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:40.580]   By going to a place like coinbase now coinbase owns your Bitcoin and they've reported all of that
[00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:44.620]   To the IRS and anybody else who comes with the proper government
[00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:52.020]   Documentation and you've seen recently in Congress in the United States. These crypto companies are bending over backward to be regulated
[00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:55.740]   they would love to be regulated because they're making a lot of money and
[00:46:55.740 --> 00:47:01.180]   they do not believe in what I see as the essence of Bitcoin, which is to be a
[00:47:01.180 --> 00:47:07.660]   Currency that is outside of any government structure. Of course, that is an existential threat. So
[00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:10.720]   To have private Bitcoin
[00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:13.980]   Okay, and we've already explained how the transactions
[00:47:14.660 --> 00:47:21.100]   Cannot be private, but if people trace that back and they can't find a name, they can't find a coinbase account
[00:47:21.100 --> 00:47:25.100]   They can't find any information. That's a good start. So, how can you do that? Well
[00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:32.620]   One simple way is to visit a Bitcoin ATM. There's a great website coin ATM radar
[00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:38.460]   calm coin ATM radar calm you can also try Google Maps and
[00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:46.460]   Find a Bitcoin near you unfortunately most of these or fortunately for the American audience most of these are in the United States
[00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:52.260]   But these are growing by the day now a Bitcoin ATM is a repository
[00:47:52.260 --> 00:48:00.180]   It looks like a regular ATM you walk up you approach from the side and cover the screen cover the camera because why not?
[00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:02.540]   and
[00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:08.980]   You go through the go through the prompts on the screen and hopefully it will let you insert your cash
[00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:10.340]   and
[00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:14.860]   Get Bitcoin to your wallet now in order to do that. Let's let's take a couple steps back
[00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:17.700]   so you'll want to have a
[00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:19.980]   Bitcoin wallet
[00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:21.540]   That is not
[00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:25.620]   Online only that's not really online except to interact with the blockchain
[00:48:25.620 --> 00:48:30.400]   The one that I recommend a lot of people recommend is Electrum. This is an easy wallet
[00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:33.180]   You can download it right now in a few seconds Electrum
[00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:40.420]   You download Electrum you go through the process of setting up the account make sure to note your seed phrase
[00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:44.500]   The seed phrase is the identity of your Bitcoin. Don't lose that
[00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:47.060]   Write that down somewhere put it in the safe
[00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:53.920]   And at that point you have your Electrum wallet and you can receive and send Bitcoin with it now
[00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:58.620]   When the Bitcoin ATM asks for your address you would give it that address
[00:48:59.620 --> 00:49:06.660]   Hopefully it's accepted your cash without you giving any information and then you it will process that transaction in about 30 minutes
[00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:09.720]   Now Bitcoin ATMs have some problems a lot of them have
[00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:13.960]   Know your customer KYC things that you have to do
[00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:19.860]   It will want you to scan your driver's license, obviously, I don't advocate
[00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:24.420]   Doing that it might want various information from you if it asks for a name
[00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:30.860]   Give it a name if it asks for a phone number. There's a great website that I use sometimes
[00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:35.740]   It's called free phone num and you am free phone num
[00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:42.100]   calm and you can make use of a few different numbers that typically can
[00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:49.140]   Receive SMS text messages. And so if you were to go to the ATM and you have your phone out you go to the website
[00:49:49.140 --> 00:49:53.980]   free phone num calm then you can use one of those phone numbers and
[00:49:54.380 --> 00:49:56.660]   Hopefully if you give them a phone number and a name
[00:49:56.660 --> 00:50:00.060]   you can be on your way and get your
[00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:05.220]   Bitcoin from the ATM. I know I'm kind of going on and on there are a lot of variables here
[00:50:05.220 --> 00:50:08.020]   It's really not easy to get Bitcoin
[00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:14.780]   Privately the ATM is is simply one method and of course the ATM is going to charge you 10 15 percent
[00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:19.380]   For for your for your troubles a few of the other ways to get Bitcoin privately
[00:50:19.380 --> 00:50:22.100]   I'll just kind of cover them and you can tell me if you want to
[00:50:23.100 --> 00:50:28.700]   Go into more detail, of course, if you are part of some kind of community you can go to a conference
[00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:33.120]   You can buy Bitcoin in cash. You can see if your store
[00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:37.740]   Excuse me. You can you could try to sell something for Bitcoin
[00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:42.980]   a lot of it is simply some of this hustle that you've talked about of finding somebody who has Bitcoin and
[00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:48.580]   Offering them something for it. There. There are some other ways to get Bitcoin privately, but those are
[00:50:49.100 --> 00:50:53.420]   Quote-unquote the easiest ways if you don't want to be part of the the coinbase
[00:50:53.420 --> 00:50:56.060]   centralized
[00:50:56.060 --> 00:50:58.060]   KYC
[00:50:58.060 --> 00:51:02.940]   Bitcoin route which in my opinion cuts against the a lot of the purpose of
[00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:06.500]   Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies
[00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:08.500]   Why do you think people?
[00:51:08.500 --> 00:51:12.260]   Well first I guess I could ask this question. I'm pretty sure I know the answer
[00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:16.980]   Do you think people should have the right to
[00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:19.980]   financial privacy in their affairs
[00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:24.860]   Assuming that you do think that why do you think that should be the case philosophically?
[00:51:24.860 --> 00:51:28.660]   Why should you have any right to privacy with regard to your money?
[00:51:28.660 --> 00:51:31.860]   After all, the only reason you would want to do it is because you're a tax cheap, right?
[00:51:31.860 --> 00:51:34.820]   well
[00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:37.980]   That is what people would say and they would have
[00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:39.980]   entirely
[00:51:39.980 --> 00:51:45.380]   Missed the point. The point is there are a few things that are immoral in life. I would consider
[00:51:46.180 --> 00:51:48.180]   stealing from somebody to be
[00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:49.460]   absolutely
[00:51:49.460 --> 00:51:54.580]   Immoral hurting somebody would be immoral if you're not doing one of these very basic things
[00:51:54.580 --> 00:51:57.700]   Then you are not doing anything wrong. The government may disagree
[00:51:57.700 --> 00:52:03.940]   Voltaire once said that it's it's dangerous to be right when the government is wrong. That will remain to be the case
[00:52:03.940 --> 00:52:05.660]   but
[00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:07.660]   financial privacy you
[00:52:07.660 --> 00:52:09.860]   Are not directly harming somebody
[00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:15.140]   Whatever you're doing with your money, and so I see no justification
[00:52:15.820 --> 00:52:17.420]   whatsoever for
[00:52:17.420 --> 00:52:19.020]   banning of
[00:52:19.020 --> 00:52:21.900]   transactions, of course we can talk about
[00:52:21.900 --> 00:52:29.700]   Where we can talk about the banning the criminalization the
[00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:38.140]   Justice system as it pertains to harming people physically and such but money itself is a
[00:52:38.140 --> 00:52:43.100]   Neutral thing just like the air we breathe just like weapons just like any kind of thing
[00:52:44.580 --> 00:52:46.580]   It's not a it's not an easy
[00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:48.780]   an easy
[00:52:48.780 --> 00:52:53.660]   Question to answer and I think that unfortunately well in some ways it is an easy question to answer
[00:52:53.660 --> 00:52:58.400]   You don't really need I don't need to justify anything that I want to do
[00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:01.980]   As long as I'm not harming another person
[00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:06.180]   All right, I can do pretty much anything I want to do as long as I'm not harming another person
[00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:13.580]   But I think to me one of the reasons why I'm quite passionate about helping people enhance privacy
[00:53:14.340 --> 00:53:15.700]   of
[00:53:15.700 --> 00:53:22.260]   Communications privacy over your life activities privacy over your financial transactions, etc
[00:53:22.260 --> 00:53:26.860]   Is because I see it as one of the best things that you can do to minimize the worst-case outcomes
[00:53:26.860 --> 00:53:33.660]   There's not a single point in history that you can point to where giving a government agent more data ever did anything good
[00:53:33.660 --> 00:53:37.940]   Even in the short term when you say oh, it doesn't look good. You go back and you look at it
[00:53:37.940 --> 00:53:39.940]   And you find that the biggest I
[00:53:39.940 --> 00:53:42.900]   guess
[00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:44.900]   it
[00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:51.980]   It's a massive risk to have a repository of data I think about it kind of like this
[00:53:51.980 --> 00:53:57.500]   Do you remember the the explosion that happened in Lebanon a couple years ago, right? You have this giant
[00:53:57.500 --> 00:54:01.340]   Concentration of
[00:54:01.340 --> 00:54:03.340]   explosive material
[00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:09.500]   You are a fool if you ever put massive amounts of explosive material in one central warehouse
[00:54:09.900 --> 00:54:16.700]   You're a fool now. There may be reasons and times at which you amass certain amounts of explosive material
[00:54:16.700 --> 00:54:21.180]   You might be getting ready for a firework show. You might be ready ready to bomb somebody, right?
[00:54:21.180 --> 00:54:25.020]   There are maybe reasons and times but in terms of a general practice
[00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:29.860]   You don't put large amounts of explosive material in a central depository
[00:54:29.860 --> 00:54:35.660]   And it doesn't matter whether the guards of that central depository are totally honest and totally good-hearted
[00:54:35.660 --> 00:54:39.140]   Let's assume that they are when you put the material in one place
[00:54:39.140 --> 00:54:43.860]   You put all the financial data you put all of the current all of the contact data, etc
[00:54:43.860 --> 00:54:46.380]   You put all the explosive stuff in one place
[00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:53.060]   You create an incredible target for someone else to try to attack you create the target by making it a rich target
[00:54:53.060 --> 00:54:59.180]   And so maybe everyone who's guarding the warehouse is perfectly honest and perfectly right and perfectly moral
[00:54:59.180 --> 00:55:03.820]   It's still dumb to put the repository all the information there on the other hand
[00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:07.340]   What do you do when you get more and more material in one place?
[00:55:07.340 --> 00:55:10.980]   Will you raise the stakes you raise the temptation for somebody to use that data?
[00:55:10.980 --> 00:55:16.480]   And so whether it's in this case a government agent or a non-government agent doing it
[00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:22.180]   You have to protect the data and the only way again, the only way to protect it is through putting
[00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:24.140]   barriers and
[00:55:24.140 --> 00:55:29.340]   Watertight doors through segmenting the data out properly in in diverse
[00:55:29.900 --> 00:55:35.860]   Institutions and so this is the one of the basic problems that we face in the modern world is that because of the digital
[00:55:35.860 --> 00:55:41.620]   Connectedness if we were to go back a hundred years where you were working with a bank and you had all of your records
[00:55:41.620 --> 00:55:48.460]   With a local banking institution didn't matter right? So what the local bank knows something of my institutions. It's not that big of a deal
[00:55:48.460 --> 00:55:54.040]   Yes, somebody could go and they could rob that bank and they could possibly get that data. Okay, that's fine
[00:55:54.860 --> 00:56:01.020]   They might get a hundred people's data or a thousand people's data, but they're not gonna get millions of people's of data
[00:56:01.020 --> 00:56:05.700]   But today if a hacker goes in and accesses the Bank of America
[00:56:05.700 --> 00:56:13.940]   Databases that hacker gets the data for four hundred four millions of people and then you get some goofy email from Bank of America
[00:56:13.940 --> 00:56:17.380]   Oh dear customer. We're so sorry that your data has been exposed in a data breach
[00:56:17.380 --> 00:56:20.620]   We're taking actions to quickly fix this problem in here
[00:56:20.620 --> 00:56:23.980]   We're gonna offer you 12 months of free credit monitoring from blah blah blah blah blah
[00:56:24.380 --> 00:56:32.500]   And so you're creating the temptation and it's vastly worse when you're creating the temptation for people who have the power
[00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:39.300]   And authority to put you in prison for people who have the power and authority to take your stuff, etc. And so
[00:56:39.300 --> 00:56:48.660]   it's philosophically stupid to support the centralization of data because even the most honest and moral and upright of
[00:56:48.860 --> 00:56:52.980]   Men can be corrupted by when the temptation is too big
[00:56:52.980 --> 00:56:56.780]   And so to me that's my reason is that we live in a world where there's massive risk
[00:56:56.780 --> 00:57:02.420]   And I don't particularly care for anybody to have access to your data about what?
[00:57:02.420 --> 00:57:09.140]   About your life your communications because it simply creates too many opportunities for trouble
[00:57:09.140 --> 00:57:13.840]   So, I mean that's not the most eloquently stated of arguments
[00:57:13.840 --> 00:57:19.140]   But to me, I don't want a bunch of explosive material in one place if explosive material has to be created
[00:57:19.140 --> 00:57:20.940]   I want it to be separated it out
[00:57:20.940 --> 00:57:25.180]   And since I don't see anybody on the public space who's who?
[00:57:25.180 --> 00:57:30.020]   Everyone around just wants to put more and more explosives in a giant warehouse in the center of town
[00:57:30.020 --> 00:57:33.640]   I think that's unsafe. And so I just keep trying to move a little bit farther out of town
[00:57:33.640 --> 00:57:38.540]   Well, that's that's well said Joshua. That's a that's a typical Joshua sheets
[00:57:38.540 --> 00:57:42.000]   analogy there which I which I always appreciate and
[00:57:42.420 --> 00:57:48.100]   You're right a lot of people we like to talk about monopolies Amazon this and that the only monopoly in your life is
[00:57:48.100 --> 00:57:50.460]   Government because government is the only institution
[00:57:50.460 --> 00:57:55.140]   Which you have knows you have no say in the matter when I didn't want to use Facebook
[00:57:55.140 --> 00:58:01.080]   I stopped when I didn't want to use Google I changed when I didn't want to use Amazon
[00:58:01.080 --> 00:58:05.780]   That's a little bit more difficult, but I can go elsewhere. That is not the case with government if you
[00:58:05.780 --> 00:58:11.720]   Continue to go around believing that Santa Claus is real or that government is there to help people
[00:58:11.720 --> 00:58:16.260]   I would encourage you to listen to one of my episodes called privacy and psychopaths
[00:58:16.260 --> 00:58:20.260]   I think that right there might in itself change your mind about
[00:58:20.260 --> 00:58:23.140]   whether government is there for you or
[00:58:23.140 --> 00:58:26.860]   Whether it's there for its own interest as all
[00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:29.420]   organisms in the world are
[00:58:29.420 --> 00:58:33.520]   and so you're right what you've touched on is the fact that privacy and
[00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:36.640]   decentralization are sister terms and
[00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:43.560]   If you want to have privacy in your life and privacy ultimately is protection against any of the many threats out there
[00:58:43.560 --> 00:58:48.540]   Then you are going to aim for more decentralization in your life when one broker is
[00:58:48.540 --> 00:58:56.120]   planning things out when one broker has all of the authority all of the information then you don't have that and
[00:58:56.120 --> 00:59:01.260]   When they get exposed and they will get exposed they always get exposed
[00:59:01.700 --> 00:59:07.920]   They there are always breaches breaches every day Coinbase and all these places are hacked all the time
[00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:09.920]   I deal with clients just in the last few weeks
[00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:15.380]   Their their money's gone from their bank accounts. Their crypto is gone from their Coinbase accounts
[00:59:15.380 --> 00:59:20.160]   You have trusted to a central authority. You've given them the keys. You don't have the keys yourself
[00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:23.400]   you have not
[00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:29.300]   Made sure to possess your own finances your own information on your own local
[00:59:29.380 --> 00:59:32.580]   computer or in your own house and you are at risk of
[00:59:32.580 --> 00:59:40.860]   Every you are at risk of all the things that follow from centralization. I would add to those companies
[00:59:40.860 --> 00:59:49.560]   Lest we be accused of beating too hard on government was it five eight years ago when the Department of Defense database
[00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:57.300]   was breached and basically anybody who had ever had any kind of clearance or relationship with the Department of Defense their information was released and
[00:59:57.300 --> 00:59:59.300]   For crying out loud right now
[00:59:59.300 --> 01:00:02.820]   I mean hold on Gabriel. I'm sure you're shocked
[01:00:02.820 --> 01:00:08.000]   Do you recognize that they haven't yet found the whistleblower at the IRS?
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:13.860]   Who mailed the private data of hundreds of the wealthiest Americans to the newspaper?
[01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:18.100]   Articles, can you can you believe they haven't yet come to the bottom of this yet?
[01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:20.500]   It should be America's most wanted somehow
[01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:25.780]   It's not somehow it's not because it's politically convenient and even if my guys are in control today
[01:00:25.780 --> 01:00:31.860]   I know that my guys will be out of control tomorrow and I don't trust any of the guys and so I've got to put
[01:00:31.860 --> 01:00:36.220]   Some some things in place. I want to go back to the Bitcoin question
[01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:41.220]   Okay, because here is the catch-22 first question. Is it possible to?
[01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:44.140]   acquire store and
[01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:48.020]   transact Bitcoin without a cell phone
[01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:53.140]   Yes
[01:00:53.140 --> 01:00:55.140]   Yes, you can do that
[01:00:55.140 --> 01:00:57.140]   it becomes a
[01:00:57.140 --> 01:01:06.340]   Little bit more tricky, of course to transact in Bitcoin you either need the address which is a long
[01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:14.500]   numerical alphabetical address that you would give to somebody or type in or it is often abbreviated most people use a
[01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:18.340]   QR code. Okay, and so you could for example
[01:01:18.340 --> 01:01:21.220]   Remember your code or write it down
[01:01:21.660 --> 01:01:24.740]   Take a photo of your QR codes
[01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:30.540]   And okay and carry around carry them around with you on paper. Of course, you could do that
[01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:32.900]   Is there a kind of intermediary?
[01:01:32.900 --> 01:01:34.940]   step where
[01:01:34.940 --> 01:01:37.580]   You're not because in this scenario
[01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:41.900]   You would have to go back to your computer and look at your account and all this kind of stuff
[01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:43.900]   Is there a kind of intermediary way?
[01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:50.180]   That's a good question, I'll have to get back to you
[01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:55.620]   The reason well the reason I I lift it up because because in my opinion one of the hardest things to do for most people
[01:01:55.620 --> 01:01:59.380]   In the privacy space is to have a private cell phone
[01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:04.860]   It's not that it's not possible right in your book you lay out some of the solutions. It's totally possible
[01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:08.940]   It's just very difficult and I see that the set in my opinion
[01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:12.420]   The cell phone is what is the biggest privacy breach that most of us have right?
[01:02:12.420 --> 01:02:17.020]   We carry around a personal location device to page basically everywhere we go
[01:02:17.660 --> 01:02:22.100]   virtually all of our most important information is is stored on or
[01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:28.980]   Accessed through that device and yet that device is not particularly secure and when we add on to it
[01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:35.100]   Using it for Bitcoin, then it becomes more more difficult. There are a couple of devices on the market
[01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:42.140]   I've been meaning to get and look into as far as some of the the hardware the device wallets that are trying to solve this
[01:02:43.100 --> 01:02:50.500]   But I think it's an interesting area of interesting area focus for us. Yeah, that's an important question. I can I mention the
[01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:56.220]   That's an important question. And I'm performing all the research to have the
[01:02:56.220 --> 01:03:02.780]   Have the extreme worst-case scenario. Let's say you're you're you're fleeing a country and you can't bring your phone
[01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:09.300]   and we might have more to say about that and in a crypto course that that we're working on and so
[01:03:10.180 --> 01:03:12.980]   It's a good question. It's a good question because you obviously
[01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:18.220]   The phone we haven't even talked about phones yet phones are not your friend and privacy surprise
[01:03:18.220 --> 01:03:21.460]   and you don't want to be walking around with an extra phone or
[01:03:21.460 --> 01:03:27.700]   An iPod touch or something like this an iPod touch doesn't have all of the the various GPS
[01:03:27.700 --> 01:03:31.160]   Chips and such in it like a like a phone does you don't want to be?
[01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:38.420]   encumbered with all that stuff and you still want to use your Bitcoin, of course, the easiest way is to go around with your laptop and
[01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:42.380]   Pull up your Electrum wallets not always convenient
[01:03:42.380 --> 01:03:44.460]   hopefully
[01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:48.860]   There are people coming up with some intermediary options and I'll have some more to say about that soon
[01:03:48.860 --> 01:03:50.860]   Yeah, I want to add one more comment
[01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:56.020]   Because there is a good segment of the audience that agrees with you are in my position
[01:03:56.020 --> 01:03:58.860]   There's also a good segment of the audience that doesn't see the point
[01:03:58.860 --> 01:04:01.900]   I want to add one more point and this is why I'm so
[01:04:01.900 --> 01:04:06.040]   Enthusiastic about trying to be involved and help to see these areas grow
[01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:12.140]   You and I can easily afford to have bank accounts you and I can eat our wells
[01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:17.680]   You and I are well served by the financial industry. We have phones. We have computers. We have bank accounts
[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:21.380]   We get low-cost banking low-cost investment low-cost transactions
[01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:23.620]   Yeah strike charges me a good amount of money
[01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:29.020]   But it's not that much in the grand scheme of things given the the convenience of it PayPal. It's useful, etc
[01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:35.180]   But there is a massive massive percentage of the world that does not have access to these services
[01:04:35.180 --> 01:04:39.660]   And what my hope is that we can use the exciting prospects of Bitcoin
[01:04:39.660 --> 01:04:45.380]   The growth I used to see is a major problem. I don't see it as a major problem anymore. I see it as something that
[01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:49.540]   Requires consideration
[01:04:49.540 --> 01:04:51.260]   the devices etc
[01:04:51.260 --> 01:04:57.100]   Just using it will help to bring the services that we take for granted to an increasing segment of the world
[01:04:57.100 --> 01:05:02.280]   Population and that is going to help us create an exceedingly exciting future
[01:05:02.540 --> 01:05:05.820]   when more and more of the smartest people in the world that are currently
[01:05:05.820 --> 01:05:12.160]   Blocked locked out because they don't have the right passport. They don't have the right government ID number. They don't have the right
[01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:17.900]   Ability to get with a certain merchant processor as those people come into the global economy
[01:05:17.900 --> 01:05:23.140]   it's just gonna turbocharge the current great growth that we enjoy and and
[01:05:23.140 --> 01:05:30.900]   Bitcoin is a major component of that going forward as I see it, but unfortunately Josh, there's no accountability with Bitcoin
[01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:34.220]   So what you're looking for is a one world government digital currency
[01:05:34.220 --> 01:05:48.500]   Hopefully we'll get maybe the Chinese version will be the one that will bail us out lovely
[01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:54.900]   Anything we've missed anything that you think we should cover looking through the table of contents here for the book
[01:05:54.900 --> 01:05:58.380]   We could talk about
[01:05:59.740 --> 01:06:02.900]   Phones for a moment if you'd like. Yeah, let's do that because that's very practical
[01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:06.100]   so you just you just had a good summary of a phone it is a
[01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:12.040]   Device that has a camera pointing at you and at others. It has a built-in microphone
[01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:19.660]   It has multiple chips that are used to pinpoint your location when the phone is working within a few meters
[01:06:19.660 --> 01:06:21.980]   wherever you are in the world bouncing off of the
[01:06:21.980 --> 01:06:24.780]   satellites and cell towers
[01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:30.980]   This is very juicy information it by default uses something called SMS text messages, which are free floating in the air
[01:06:30.980 --> 01:06:38.140]   Which are easily captured with the right equipment, for example by police during protests. They have devices called stingrays
[01:06:38.140 --> 01:06:43.580]   They can read all of that all those SMS text messages being sent your phone calls
[01:06:43.580 --> 01:06:47.340]   Can be certainly documented especially the metadata
[01:06:48.060 --> 01:06:55.700]   Okay, and your phone as well has a operating system that is designed to integrate all of these things and make life more convenient
[01:06:55.700 --> 01:06:58.660]   so it's not your friend in privacy and
[01:06:58.660 --> 01:07:03.500]   What we will say with phones what I'll say with phones is first
[01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:08.620]   Learn to do more with a real computer as opposed to a phone
[01:07:08.620 --> 01:07:14.380]   I don't use my phone for almost anything. I use my phone as it's meant to be used as a
[01:07:14.380 --> 01:07:17.380]   communication tool when I'm away from home and
[01:07:18.380 --> 01:07:23.660]   Particularly using private encrypted end-to-end encrypted zero knowledge
[01:07:23.660 --> 01:07:30.900]   Messengers we've mentioned signal wire whatsapp doesn't have all those characteristics, but it's better than nothing
[01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:35.780]   And so that is what your phone is meant to do. It's not meant to be your bank account
[01:07:35.780 --> 01:07:38.540]   it's not meant to
[01:07:38.540 --> 01:07:46.940]   Well, let's put it like this let's let let's go back to some of the facts the Facebook app was
[01:07:47.420 --> 01:07:52.060]   found in a Wall Street Journal study to be communicating and getting information from
[01:07:52.060 --> 01:07:54.980]   Various other apps that were around in this case
[01:07:54.980 --> 01:07:57.860]   menstruation calendar apps
[01:07:57.860 --> 01:08:03.540]   Weather apps all kinds of stuff. This is information that's being gathered and attached to your Facebook profile
[01:08:03.540 --> 01:08:10.140]   I'm not very comfortable with that kind of stuff being shared, but that's just how phones work
[01:08:10.140 --> 01:08:11.860]   They're highly incestuous
[01:08:11.860 --> 01:08:19.180]   They are designed to do this now. It's quite simple if you commit to it to do these things on your computer
[01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:25.420]   More of these things on your computer get a good laptop. Not a Chromebook get a good real laptop
[01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:26.220]   You can get a cheap one
[01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:31.980]   I like cheap a sir laptops for example a couple hundred dollars or a few hundred dollars and you're on your way
[01:08:31.980 --> 01:08:36.320]   You can instead of going to the Bank of America app. Just go to the website
[01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:39.940]   When you want to check the weather, you don't need an app for that
[01:08:39.940 --> 01:08:43.260]   just go to a browser and type in the
[01:08:43.260 --> 01:08:48.220]   The weather weather comm or whatever you're searching for there
[01:08:48.220 --> 01:08:54.200]   So there are first of all you want to do more things away from your phone and on your computer
[01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:59.380]   As you can. All right. I've lost my train of thought. What what should we be talking about as regards phones?
[01:08:59.380 --> 01:09:03.300]   I think the first thing would be which which service provider right? You basically have two options
[01:09:03.300 --> 01:09:08.420]   Apple versus Android so I think you need to begin there, right? Okay, so
[01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:13.220]   We might let me let me try to do this without getting into the weeds so
[01:09:13.220 --> 01:09:19.180]   First of all, how do you have a private phone a private phone is a phone first of all that has been purchased
[01:09:19.180 --> 01:09:23.980]   Without a connection to your name. So that would be cash in this case
[01:09:23.980 --> 01:09:27.220]   It would be a phone that has service
[01:09:27.220 --> 01:09:33.700]   That is not in your name. So you could buy a prepaid SIM card and
[01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:39.820]   Re-up it with gift cards or any other way. This is not too difficult
[01:09:39.820 --> 01:09:44.860]   To do this kind of thing. So you will have purchased it privately
[01:09:44.860 --> 01:09:51.100]   You'll have purchased these service privately and I realize that you can't do that in all countries. I think Nigeria South Korea
[01:09:51.100 --> 01:09:56.460]   If you get a phone SIM card, this is highly tied to your national identity
[01:09:56.460 --> 01:10:00.620]   It's difficult to get around that now if you're using private messengers on your phone
[01:10:01.180 --> 01:10:06.460]   You can connect to Wi-Fi and use that and communicate just like normal
[01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:06.780]   Of course
[01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:13.500]   The benefit of phone is you have that satellite signal the data signal so that you can use the device
[01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:16.140]   When you're not near Wi-Fi, I understand them. That's the goal
[01:10:16.140 --> 01:10:19.980]   But in order to have the private phone you want to acquire the SIM card
[01:10:19.980 --> 01:10:22.940]   In cash gift cards, whatever the case may be
[01:10:22.940 --> 01:10:28.180]   So that's not tied to your name now you start up the phone. Is that an Android or an Apple?
[01:10:28.180 --> 01:10:34.500]   I don't really care. I don't I don't differentiate a whole lot between those two because what I'm looking for is a phone
[01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:39.220]   That's going to do the basic stuff for me and it's not going to be doing all this other stuff
[01:10:39.220 --> 01:10:43.780]   If you are downloading a hundred apps, then you don't care about privacy
[01:10:43.780 --> 01:10:49.380]   But in that case you could go with Apple because Apple is a little bit better out of the box
[01:10:49.380 --> 01:10:52.460]   When you create an Apple ID
[01:10:52.460 --> 01:10:55.860]   There's a process that you'll get to
[01:10:55.860 --> 01:11:00.500]   There's a process that you'll go through you don't want to give you a real name
[01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:05.180]   You want to have an email address perhaps a proton mail email address that is
[01:11:05.180 --> 01:11:10.620]   New and dedicated just to this don't obviously don't reveal
[01:11:10.620 --> 01:11:17.380]   Information about yourself. You'll have to give a phone number for that Apple account. You'll just have to give your
[01:11:17.380 --> 01:11:22.620]   Phone number attached to the SIM card. They probably already know that information anyway
[01:11:22.620 --> 01:11:26.500]   And so at that point you will have an Apple device or an Android device
[01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:29.380]   Purchased not in your name
[01:11:29.380 --> 01:11:31.420]   SIM card not in your name
[01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:38.660]   And you will then have to take your prudence your privacy prudence and apply that to what apps you download or don't download
[01:11:38.660 --> 01:11:45.500]   The information that you give it be careful about permissions things of this nature. You can use your VPN on a phone
[01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:47.140]   That's always wise
[01:11:47.140 --> 01:11:49.140]   we have things like
[01:11:49.940 --> 01:11:56.580]   Faraday bags which block out all signals if you don't want your phone to be pinpointing your location
[01:11:56.580 --> 01:12:01.620]   Where you are, you can slip it in the sleeve. You obviously can't use it. And so that's why
[01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:06.900]   That's why I kind of conclude in my chapter on phone privacy. It's it's
[01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:13.020]   It's almost impossible to have a phone privacy because if the phone is working it's pinpointing
[01:12:13.020 --> 01:12:16.020]   It's identifying you by your location by definition
[01:12:16.260 --> 01:12:21.540]   And so there's one way around that which we can talk about if you want. That's the my pseudo
[01:12:21.540 --> 01:12:23.900]   iPod touch version
[01:12:23.900 --> 01:12:25.900]   we could also talk about
[01:12:25.900 --> 01:12:33.220]   Graphene OS which is a custom software that you would have to install on your phone. These are these are more complicated things but
[01:12:33.220 --> 01:12:34.780]   in
[01:12:34.780 --> 01:12:37.420]   For them the primer version I would say
[01:12:37.420 --> 01:12:43.400]   Simply start using your phone less stop attaching as much information to it as you can
[01:12:43.700 --> 01:12:50.340]   And just kind of be more aware of what you're doing on your phone. Are you willing to say are you using?
[01:12:50.340 --> 01:12:52.940]   Do you continue to use the iPod?
[01:12:52.940 --> 01:12:55.940]   Trick or using the graph a graphing phone at this point
[01:12:55.940 --> 01:12:59.260]   What are you willing to say?
[01:12:59.260 --> 01:13:02.100]   Feel free to say no
[01:13:02.100 --> 01:13:08.380]   Privacy expert. What are you doing? Well, I'm using and testing out both and
[01:13:09.020 --> 01:13:15.420]   The the thing about graphene OS graphene OS as I said is a custom software you download on your computer. It strips out
[01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:18.180]   it strips out a lot of the
[01:13:18.180 --> 01:13:24.460]   Android functionality that was previously being reported to Google now when you're using the graphene OS
[01:13:24.460 --> 01:13:27.620]   It's still pinpointing your location with its data trail
[01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:30.420]   But it's not doing a whole lot else
[01:13:30.420 --> 01:13:36.980]   So if you've acquired that phone and SIM card privately that will do you fairly well now
[01:13:37.260 --> 01:13:39.260]   the other option is
[01:13:39.260 --> 01:13:40.780]   which you
[01:13:40.780 --> 01:13:42.780]   reference Joshua is the
[01:13:42.780 --> 01:13:44.140]   Apple
[01:13:44.140 --> 01:13:50.340]   iPod touch approach now. This is a little bit complicated. Let me just try to boil it down. So you have an
[01:13:50.340 --> 01:13:53.140]   Apple iPhone and
[01:13:53.140 --> 01:13:55.020]   You have an iPod touch
[01:13:55.020 --> 01:13:58.980]   Okay, the iPod touch is the thing and I don't take credit for this by the way
[01:13:58.980 --> 01:14:04.940]   This is something that Michael Bozell and and others have have worked out but the iPod touch is for at home
[01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:06.980]   Okay, the iPod touch stays at home
[01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:09.020]   your iPad your
[01:14:09.020 --> 01:14:16.020]   iPhone is what you take on you with journeys on your on journeys when you're outside of the house
[01:14:16.020 --> 01:14:19.500]   so when you start to approach your home you slip your
[01:14:19.500 --> 01:14:26.780]   iPhone into a Faraday bag and that does not get used anymore. You get home you use your you use your iPod touch
[01:14:26.780 --> 01:14:28.780]   which is not
[01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:30.780]   calling out to
[01:14:30.780 --> 01:14:34.860]   Geolocation at all and it doesn't have some other things that are
[01:14:35.380 --> 01:14:42.260]   Anyway, it is not calling out your geolocation and you can connect these two devices
[01:14:42.260 --> 01:14:44.780]   to
[01:14:44.780 --> 01:14:51.620]   Use the same apps that you would use on your iPhone. And so for example, here's the here's the main point
[01:14:51.620 --> 01:14:57.220]   There is a program called my pseudo Joshua has mentioned it before doesn't always work in countries
[01:14:57.220 --> 01:14:59.740]   outside of the US especially but
[01:15:00.260 --> 01:15:02.260]   My pseudo allows you to have
[01:15:02.260 --> 01:15:05.300]   Up to nine phone numbers
[01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:10.420]   Which are not sent through your typical phone wires
[01:15:10.420 --> 01:15:16.100]   It is through a data connection. You have nine phone numbers legitimate phone numbers and you can make your calls
[01:15:16.100 --> 01:15:18.620]   You can do your SMS
[01:15:18.620 --> 01:15:24.100]   Messaging you can do your code verification through these numbers
[01:15:24.100 --> 01:15:27.380]   And so that might be something you're interested in
[01:15:28.060 --> 01:15:32.700]   I realize I'm getting to the weeds again with this one. Let me just for the let me give the non
[01:15:32.700 --> 01:15:35.700]   Well sort of the non-technical reason as to why that that works
[01:15:35.700 --> 01:15:45.180]   so if we understand what a phone is and what it is doing you can see that it has a number of major
[01:15:45.180 --> 01:15:47.860]   vulnerabilities for those who care about privacy and
[01:15:47.860 --> 01:15:54.860]   The number one vulnerability that a phone has a cell phone a normal cell phone is it has a radio chip
[01:15:54.860 --> 01:16:01.300]   that radio chip in it is communicating with local cell phone towers and it's establishing a constant
[01:16:01.300 --> 01:16:07.500]   Connection through the local cell phone towers if your phone can reach a tower. It's reporting its position
[01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:12.980]   It's reporting its position through triangulation for the towers and they could tell exactly where it is
[01:16:12.980 --> 01:16:20.540]   So now you go back and let's use an event like say if you were in Washington DC on January 6 for a protest
[01:16:20.540 --> 01:16:21.900]   and
[01:16:21.900 --> 01:16:26.140]   You had your cell phone on you or if you were in downtown
[01:16:26.140 --> 01:16:30.380]   Insert City here for a protest and you had your cell phone on you
[01:16:30.380 --> 01:16:33.980]   If that cell phone is on you and it is powered on it is
[01:16:33.980 --> 01:16:38.900]   Communicating with a tower and it is creating a real-time record of your location
[01:16:38.900 --> 01:16:44.780]   This is for the most part for most of us doesn't matter right not going anywhere a place
[01:16:44.780 --> 01:16:47.980]   I shouldn't be right to go and protest as a First Amendment, right?
[01:16:47.980 --> 01:16:52.500]   There's no reason why I can't assemble on the streets of my local town. There's no problem with it
[01:16:52.500 --> 01:16:59.260]   But what happens is oftentimes there are events and then frequently in this case is law enforcement law enforcement will go and they will
[01:16:59.260 --> 01:17:05.780]   Solicit the request the subpoena the records from all the local cell phone providers and say tell us all of the phones that were
[01:17:05.780 --> 01:17:12.380]   In this certain place at this certain time and then continue their investigations and sometimes a protest that you went to
[01:17:12.740 --> 01:17:20.140]   that you thought was just a good ordinary protest for you to say say your mind downtown Kenosha, Wisconsin or
[01:17:20.140 --> 01:17:22.540]   You know downtown Washington DC, etc
[01:17:22.540 --> 01:17:25.380]   Can or just a local gathering of some kind?
[01:17:25.380 --> 01:17:30.180]   Call of a sudden loops you into some stuff that you really didn't want to be involved with and can wreck your life
[01:17:30.180 --> 01:17:37.260]   so the first vulnerability in a cell phone is the radio chip if a cell phone is powered on and if it has contact with
[01:17:37.260 --> 01:17:38.220]   a
[01:17:38.220 --> 01:17:41.020]   Tower it's creating a real-time record of your location
[01:17:41.460 --> 01:17:48.700]   Tower it's creating a real-time location now in some cases even if the phone is powered off if it's within contact with the tower
[01:17:48.700 --> 01:17:50.340]   It's creating a real-time connection
[01:17:50.340 --> 01:17:54.980]   I noticed with the most recent update from Apple on my iPhone that I had that it said
[01:17:54.980 --> 01:17:57.780]   We know that find my iPhone is going to work
[01:17:57.780 --> 01:18:03.660]   Even if your phone is powered off and we in the privacy community, they've been saying for a very long time
[01:18:03.660 --> 01:18:05.100]   Oh look, even if your phone is off
[01:18:05.100 --> 01:18:08.620]   It can still be accessed remotely and people weren't really sure well
[01:18:08.620 --> 01:18:13.300]   There was right on the screen of my iPhone last week saying find my iPhone is still gonna work
[01:18:13.300 --> 01:18:20.100]   even if your phone is powered off kind of a confirmation of that the second problem is that your phone has in it a
[01:18:20.100 --> 01:18:23.820]   GPS chip and so that GPS chip is also
[01:18:23.820 --> 01:18:28.340]   Absorbing and consuming data third problem is there's a wireless card
[01:18:28.340 --> 01:18:32.780]   And so it's keeping a record of all the Wi-Fi networks nearby the Bluetooth networks, etc
[01:18:32.780 --> 01:18:37.420]   And this is why even if you don't give Facebook author is your Facebook app on your phone
[01:18:37.660 --> 01:18:41.460]   Even if you don't authorize it to have access to your location
[01:18:41.460 --> 01:18:44.900]   It still knows exactly where you are. Even if it's not using your exact GPS chip
[01:18:44.900 --> 01:18:48.100]   It's using the information from all of those networks that are around
[01:18:48.100 --> 01:18:52.500]   This is why if you go into a foreign country and you want to navigate with your GPS
[01:18:52.500 --> 01:18:54.700]   even if you have your phone an airplane mode with Wi-Fi and
[01:18:54.700 --> 01:19:00.580]   Bluetooth on the phone can still figure out where it is because it has a GPS chip and it's accessing the local networks and
[01:19:00.580 --> 01:19:02.780]   Having an idea of where it is
[01:19:02.820 --> 01:19:06.740]   So now when you add to these sensors that it give real-time
[01:19:06.740 --> 01:19:14.320]   Geolocation data you add the other things that are in a phone you add the cameras and you add the microphone you get a very significant
[01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:21.140]   vulnerability now most of us are not being hunted by some by the US Marshals or by the NSA or by the
[01:19:21.140 --> 01:19:27.300]   Russian blah blah blah or the Chinese government most of us are not but some of us are right some of us have positions of
[01:19:27.300 --> 01:19:32.640]   power some of us have position where leaders and companies and there are people who are paying our competitors to
[01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:34.200]   to
[01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:40.960]   Going online and contacting a hacker and saying hey, I'd like you to study out the competitor who's leading the local
[01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:45.560]   You know fortune 500 company or who's in the the c-suite level
[01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:49.800]   I want to not find out where he is and this data is generally publicly available
[01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:53.760]   So if you're creating the data, although it's been denied many times
[01:19:53.760 --> 01:20:00.200]   There's ample evidence that the big cell phone companies were sharing this data and this data was available for purchase
[01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:01.800]   And so again think here again
[01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:05.920]   Most of us are not coming to the attention of law enforcement a lot of the time
[01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:12.480]   You simply might have a competitor or somebody who's trying to get inside industry information. So how do you get out of all this?
[01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:18.000]   Well, first way is you can just say I'm not gonna carry a cell phone. I'm gonna carry a CB radio
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:23.520]   Well that doesn't work for most people if you had the discipline where you could simply go around with a computer
[01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:28.840]   You could set up a secure computer and then you could find a Wi-Fi network when you needed one and you could do that
[01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:34.280]   But most of us don't want to fit a 15-inch Acer laptop running Linux in our back pocket. That doesn't really work
[01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:40.080]   So what are the alternatives to this you could if possible you could have some kind of device
[01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:43.320]   That would allow you to access information
[01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:48.000]   with minimal with with fewer of these radio chips and
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:54.060]   These devices would be known as an iPhone or an iPad right an iPad mini could also work
[01:20:54.060 --> 01:20:57.080]   So if you were to purchase sue me, I said iPhone I meant iPod
[01:20:57.600 --> 01:21:02.360]   if you were to Apple is for many years sold the iPod touch which
[01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:07.240]   Functionally works the same as the iPhone in terms of the apps that can be loaded onto it
[01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:11.220]   But it doesn't have a cellular card in it. It doesn't have a GPS chip
[01:21:11.220 --> 01:21:17.500]   So it's automatically creating fewer records and it's automatically communicating less with the local
[01:21:17.500 --> 01:21:19.040]   radio signals
[01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:25.080]   so if you take an iPod touch or you can do the same thing with an iPad mini or an iPad that doesn't have a
[01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:31.360]   Cellular card in it and you simply use it you use the Wi-Fi in it and you turn on a VPN
[01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:35.000]   You can access the information that you need from those applications without
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:38.660]   Creating all of the metadata all of the location data
[01:21:38.660 --> 01:21:42.720]   And so Gabriel is talking about as many people are quite sensitive about where do I sleep at night?
[01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:49.120]   and so they'll have the iPod touch which allows them to be in contact at home and then when traveling they might use an iPhone or
[01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:53.680]   some people who are super hardcore will take an iPod touch pair that with something like a
[01:21:54.680 --> 01:22:00.240]   What's it called the hotspot jetpack type of thing an internet jetpack device to get internet data
[01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:04.360]   And so this is one of your if you really if privacy were a big deal to you
[01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:07.320]   You were a big shot. You had a big risk profile or something like that
[01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:12.640]   Then this would be one way of accessing mobile data. You would have some kind of internet
[01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:16.040]   hotspot device
[01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:19.280]   Frequently the nice thing about those is they don't have cameras on them. They don't have
[01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:25.800]   Microphones they don't have speakers. They don't have GPS chips. They're just on the on the on the internet service
[01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:26.480]   also
[01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:28.240]   Frequently they have a removable batteries
[01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:32.520]   and so if you want to get them off the grid you pop the battery off and then you pair that with something like an
[01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:39.240]   iPod touch or an iPad mini that doesn't have a radio a cell phone radio chip in it and you have a pretty good
[01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:46.120]   Solution that allows you to stay connected when you want to be but have fewer of the vulnerabilities of the constant and never-ending metadata
[01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:49.960]   All I would say is I would personally never go to any kind of protest of any kind
[01:22:49.960 --> 01:22:56.160]   And carry a cell phone in my pocket. And so if you need to have something have information
[01:22:56.160 --> 01:23:01.720]   On it and again, remember it's just because for this simple reason my guys are in power today
[01:23:01.720 --> 01:23:03.680]   But my guys won't be in power tomorrow
[01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:11.180]   And so if all of a sudden my guys aren't in power anymore and I go from politically favored to politically disfavored
[01:23:11.180 --> 01:23:15.660]   I got a problem and so you want to be thoughtful about that and this is one way of potentially doing that
[01:23:15.660 --> 01:23:17.460]   a good summary
[01:23:17.460 --> 01:23:19.460]   that that was that was
[01:23:19.460 --> 01:23:26.180]   Great Josh. It's it's that time of the afternoon. My coffee's running out. So I'm glad you picked up the slack there
[01:23:26.180 --> 01:23:30.380]   Let me just bring it home real quick for for the people who are made
[01:23:30.380 --> 01:23:33.240]   May be lost in the last 15 minutes
[01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:37.400]   Your location. Why would you want to protect your location?
[01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:40.040]   You mentioned a couple things if you're involved in a protest
[01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:46.700]   Of course your location can and if you've watched looked at the news lately the people in January 6th
[01:23:46.700 --> 01:23:49.660]   Their location was pinpointed. They were inside
[01:23:49.660 --> 01:23:53.860]   Federal property. Okay, they there's proof right there or they
[01:23:53.860 --> 01:24:00.660]   Said X or Y via SMS. They interrupt you just to add because that's super politically charged
[01:24:00.660 --> 01:24:08.340]   The Australian government is knocking on people's doors right and asking you have you been to a protest in violation of kovat regulations?
[01:24:08.460 --> 01:24:14.620]   So don't just think this is about like right-wing ism in the US like all over the world people are doing this continue correct
[01:24:14.620 --> 01:24:21.320]   Yes, maybe it's it's best to use a neutral thing. And of course during the the kovat stuff. There was all kinds of geolocation
[01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:25.660]   and here's one example in in South Korea, there was a
[01:24:25.660 --> 01:24:32.920]   There was a man who went to a shop now in South Korea. They they had an app they were being
[01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:38.600]   They were being monitored their location by their their cell phone. And as I mentioned in South Korea your cell phone is
[01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:43.920]   deeply attached to your national ID now this man goes to a restaurant and
[01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:47.600]   He tells the restaurant owner that he has
[01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:52.920]   Kovat and if he doesn't give him something for free he is going to
[01:24:52.920 --> 01:25:02.720]   Yes, he's going to blackmail him so with kovat, of course you can understand the importance of
[01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:10.420]   Location, but let me just cover a couple of other things. Let's say that you visit a gold shop or a gun shop
[01:25:10.420 --> 01:25:16.880]   You bring your phone with you. Well, there's a record that you have visited those locations in the US
[01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:22.500]   There is a vice president who has publicly laughed at the idea that the Second Amendment cannot be overturned
[01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:29.400]   So don't be any doubt about what the future might hold for people who have visited
[01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:33.840]   Gun shops if you're being stalked or you're a CEO or you're a wanted person
[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:38.380]   Obviously your location is the difference between life and death sometimes
[01:25:38.380 --> 01:25:45.480]   Verizon and a lot of other I think probably all phone services
[01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:53.080]   Offer a marketing service in Verizon's case that's called Verizon insights and basically they will sell the location information of their customers
[01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:58.040]   To businesses who want it. So let's say you are at a Trump rally
[01:25:58.640 --> 01:26:00.560]   Let's say that there are people at a Trump rally
[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:06.800]   Well Verizon can sell the information of those people who are at the Trump rally to somebody else so you can you can kind of see
[01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:11.760]   How your your phone location can be a bit of a vulnerability one more story
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:16.680]   There was a man riding his bike through a neighborhood one afternoon
[01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:19.960]   He he rode it back and forth a couple of times now
[01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:24.360]   He had his phone with him and he gets a message from Google that they were going to share his
[01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:27.000]   Have you told this story?
[01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:34.840]   I don't know this one. So he gets a message from Google. They have shared that or they're about to share various information
[01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:41.760]   Including his location with law enforcement and so he kind of panics what what's going on here hires a lawyer burns through savings
[01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:44.200]   Burns through some of his family's money
[01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:47.480]   Fighting this he doesn't want to give this out
[01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:53.120]   it turns out that he just had a phone with him and he had a Google app on there which we most of us do and
[01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:55.360]   Google
[01:26:55.360 --> 01:27:01.440]   Was noting just like his phone service, right? Google is also noting your location
[01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:06.680]   When you have it on your phone and Google was aware that he was in this area
[01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:12.920]   law enforcement will oftentimes go to Google when there's been a crime in an area which was the case here and
[01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:19.080]   This gentleman not only was in the crime scene once but twice and so he has to fight this
[01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:22.020]   He has to defend this he burns through his family savings
[01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:26.760]   and just one more reason about why you might just want to
[01:27:26.760 --> 01:27:33.480]   Use your phone less use a Faraday bag use something like graphene OS or use the iPhone and
[01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:40.120]   iPod touch strategy which we've talked about just just a few examples there of why your location
[01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:47.080]   Can be a serious vulnerability and if you say oh, no, I you know back the blue I
[01:27:47.640 --> 01:27:53.840]   Beg you go and spend a little time on innocence project calm go and read some of the cases
[01:27:53.840 --> 01:28:00.800]   That are found and you'll see why this is a major a major concern for completely innocent law-abiding
[01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:03.640]   Citizens just always remember this in the United States
[01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:09.920]   You live in the statistics you said earlier Gabriel one in twenty you live in the country if you live in the United States
[01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:16.820]   You're dealing with the country that incarcerates more of its citizens than any other country in the world by a wide margin
[01:28:16.820 --> 01:28:19.000]   I need to go and check and see if it's double the next one
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:25.240]   But it's by a wide margin very much more than anyone and yet what percentage of those
[01:28:25.240 --> 01:28:31.960]   Incarcerations are justified and what percentage of them are actually of guilty people
[01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:38.880]   That's a very very different number. So I think it's best to be prudent in all affairs. All right last thing Gabriel
[01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:46.040]   Do you what ideas do you have for the person who like me says Gabriel listen, I'm into it
[01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:50.840]   I think it's so cool to set the stuff up. I love it. I can't do it Gabe. I can't live
[01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:55.560]   I can't live this way. I can't run my business from a my pseudo number
[01:28:55.560 --> 01:29:00.280]   I can't get that I can't get SMS reliably from the verification on my bank account
[01:29:00.280 --> 01:29:04.960]   I get like I can't do it as well as I'd like to do it because having been a privacy
[01:29:04.960 --> 01:29:08.320]   Enthusiast you got to be committed because it's a real hassle
[01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:15.180]   You have spent dozens and dozens and if not hundreds of hours of your life working out ways that work and fixing things when they go
[01:29:15.180 --> 01:29:21.800]   Wrong, do you have any ideas for how you can just simply have everything work?
[01:29:21.800 --> 01:29:27.880]   Without being so committed if not, I'll give you mine. But like let's say that you said, all right
[01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:33.120]   I don't want to have it. I can't do this all the time. It's all lost. Do I have to give up privacy?
[01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:34.280]   What do you think?
[01:29:34.280 --> 01:29:38.480]   Well, of course what I will say first is if you're doing something
[01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:42.920]   It's obviously better than nothing if you were going all the way
[01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:47.980]   then you would have to go very far indeed, and I can't say that I have
[01:29:47.980 --> 01:29:51.840]   Gone that far whatsoever. So if you're doing something
[01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:57.980]   That's great. If you were just switch to Linux a Linux operating system
[01:29:57.980 --> 01:30:04.560]   So you're not giving Microsoft and and possibly Apple your data. You have one small victory. So don't be
[01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:12.320]   Don't feel that you're a failure for not having gone all the way if you've gone any distance at all
[01:30:12.600 --> 01:30:15.680]   That's a great thing in terms of strategies for making this
[01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:17.800]   more smooth
[01:30:17.800 --> 01:30:23.200]   More efficient. I don't I don't know. I wish there were unfortunately. It's it says
[01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:26.200]   Tolstoy said everybody
[01:30:26.200 --> 01:30:29.480]   Thinks about changing the world. No one thinks about changing themselves
[01:30:29.480 --> 01:30:32.640]   Okay, that doesn't quite fit what I'm saying
[01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:40.360]   But my point being that if you want to have privacy that by definition means that you are doing everything yourself
[01:30:40.360 --> 01:30:43.200]   You're doing more things yourself. You're relying on fewer and fewer
[01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:47.960]   Third parties external services that is difficult that requires a lot of work
[01:30:47.960 --> 01:30:54.000]   Maybe it's not worth it in the end, but I want to just have one more pitch for privacy here, which is that privacy?
[01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:57.280]   Can shield you from the increasingly?
[01:30:57.280 --> 01:30:59.880]   ideological
[01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:02.680]   Constraints that are placed on the Internet's if you are
[01:31:02.680 --> 01:31:07.520]   if you're not using a VPN if you have your
[01:31:08.040 --> 01:31:11.760]   Cookies and history being remembered on your browser, which I would recommend
[01:31:11.760 --> 01:31:19.880]   Not it can change if you're only using Google and Google search and YouTube it can change your access to reality
[01:31:19.880 --> 01:31:26.200]   You will be shown things that Google and whoever else wants you to see you will not be exposed to other things
[01:31:26.200 --> 01:31:31.160]   So what we're talking here is not just about protection, which is important, but we're talking about how you have access
[01:31:31.160 --> 01:31:36.880]   to reality to what's really going on in the world as opposed to what somebody some company some
[01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:43.200]   Institution wants you to see what that said Josh. Let me know what what what you're thinking about making things easier
[01:31:43.200 --> 01:31:50.480]   Well the point you're making to drive off of that. I read this really great article the other day by I wish I could cite him
[01:31:50.480 --> 01:31:54.040]   He was talking about his
[01:31:54.040 --> 01:32:01.880]   The way that he controls his children's internet usage and this essay I make this I thought that made this point brilliantly
[01:32:02.920 --> 01:32:09.720]   Many times as parents you feel a little bit guilty controlling and monitoring your children's usage now
[01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:14.000]   If you're a parent and you don't know every single thing that your child is doing on the Internet
[01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:18.600]   You're a fool and you're gonna reap what you are, you know, you're gonna reap major problems
[01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:22.560]   But you need to fix that first of all and there are some good tools for doing that
[01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:26.760]   But he was talking about this guilt. I know that was a strong statement, but please I beg you
[01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:31.580]   It's very very important that with your children. I hope this what I'm about to say gives you reason to do it
[01:32:31.800 --> 01:32:34.960]   He was talking about this guilt that sometimes you have a feel as a parent of
[01:32:34.960 --> 01:32:41.760]   Watching your children's activity and monitoring them and you say well this flies right in the face of privacy. What about their privacy?
[01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:48.960]   The point he made which I thought was so well put he said if you think that you have privacy on the Internet
[01:32:48.960 --> 01:32:50.960]   You're living in a like a world from
[01:32:50.960 --> 01:32:57.560]   1996 right you have no privacy on the Internet and he says you're you're behaving foolishly
[01:32:57.560 --> 01:33:01.360]   Because you think that you're on a free and open Internet where you have privacy
[01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:07.440]   You are you are the one being manipulated step by step for every single thing that you're doing
[01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:13.720]   You're the one who's being who ever everything that you do online is being controlled monitored watched
[01:33:13.720 --> 01:33:17.480]   absorbed purchased every single thing that you're doing online is
[01:33:17.480 --> 01:33:24.060]   Manipulated and you are falling prey to a non-stop flood of algorithms
[01:33:24.060 --> 01:33:29.280]   That are seeking to control your behavior systematically and his point as a parent
[01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:37.720]   Was that by monitoring my children's activities online and by the fact that they know that I'm monitoring
[01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:42.400]   Them I'm teaching them how to live in the world that we live in
[01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:50.000]   Which is a world of constant and never-ending monitoring and I thought it was I didn't say it as clearly and eloquently as he did
[01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000]   But I thought that's a really powerful point
[01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:55.560]   I say immediately sent it to all my friends and family like listen
[01:33:55.560 --> 01:34:02.160]   This is this is a very important point because I have a bias for privacy and my children have no privacy with regard to their
[01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:03.360]   online activities
[01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:09.080]   And and they won't for a very very long time and I thought how do you reconcile this and I thought this is the wreck
[01:34:09.080 --> 01:34:10.680]   This is the way that you reconcile it
[01:34:10.680 --> 01:34:16.240]   Can you be private on the Internet for a few minutes if you're a techno wizard and you know how to set up?
[01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:18.320]   You know a sandboxed
[01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:24.680]   Virtual machine running through multiple layers of VPNs. That's everything like you can do it. It is possible
[01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:28.440]   but it requires a vastly high level of technical knowledge and
[01:34:28.440 --> 01:34:33.920]   So most of us aren't gonna reach that level or live that way on a daily basis
[01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:39.200]   I think your point Gabriel about using clean browsers is really valuable for many years
[01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:43.360]   I have used a clean browser to simply change the browser settings
[01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:47.480]   If you just set Firefox every time you close eliminate history eliminate cookies
[01:34:47.480 --> 01:34:53.840]   I'll just scrub scrub the browser that in and of itself gives you a very different experience on the Internet because you don't wind up
[01:34:53.840 --> 01:34:57.680]   In a side and in a silo you don't wind up just constantly having feedback
[01:34:57.680 --> 01:35:00.040]   Of the an echo chamber
[01:35:00.040 --> 01:35:05.520]   And so if you go on YouTube and every time you see just native naked YouTube without your being signed in
[01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:11.040]   It gives you a vastly different experience than your own personally trained, you know algorithmically enhanced
[01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:15.160]   Personal account. So I guess what I was saying was I
[01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:21.960]   Believe that the audience of radical personal finance tends to be quite wealthy and quite well educated and quite busy
[01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:23.960]   And I think that privacy
[01:35:23.960 --> 01:35:28.760]   You are exactly right. There are levels of privacy that are possible
[01:35:28.760 --> 01:35:31.880]   And that are and that every level is good, right?
[01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:38.000]   Just putting a VPN putting it on your phone putting on your computer running it. It's great gives you a major upgrade
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:43.360]   Being thoughtful about the apps that are on your phone gives you a good upgrade being thoughtful about where you go on the internet
[01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:47.680]   And how you go good good upgrades. My answer is you can use money to solve some of this
[01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:49.740]   We didn't talk and I for the sake of time
[01:35:49.740 --> 01:35:52.280]   I don't want to get into things like location privacy
[01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:57.640]   but after doing all kinds of stuff over the years on location privacy, I became convinced that
[01:35:57.640 --> 01:36:03.600]   If you can afford it the best way to have location privacy is just simply to have an apartment where you live
[01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:06.720]   that you don't personally set foot in much and
[01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:11.240]   Looking like a normal person is a big deal for phone privacy
[01:36:11.240 --> 01:36:11.720]   right
[01:36:11.720 --> 01:36:14.880]   one of the best things you can do is just have a traditional phone number a
[01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:18.880]   Traditional thing that's useful for two-factor authentication and verification, etc
[01:36:19.480 --> 01:36:25.240]   and so I spent I have spent a lot of time and a lot of money using many of the solutions and
[01:36:25.240 --> 01:36:30.080]   Found out the limits as to where they work and don't work similar like with a business. I love my pseudo
[01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:33.600]   I think it's great. I would never run a business on it. It's gotten better, right?
[01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:36.280]   But I would never run a business on it's not reliable enough
[01:36:36.280 --> 01:36:39.480]   So if I'm running a business, I'm gonna have a phone that's dedicated to that business
[01:36:39.480 --> 01:36:42.120]   But knowing how to leave that phone behind
[01:36:42.120 --> 01:36:47.040]   Knowing how to put the phone in a Faraday cage knowing how to use the phone for what it's just to be used for
[01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:54.280]   Maybe I teach people right having a backup set right having you may not use a private phone every day all the time
[01:36:54.280 --> 01:37:01.880]   But knowing that you have a privately purchased phone that's clean that set up that's ready to go that has service and that's sitting in a Faraday
[01:37:01.880 --> 01:37:08.000]   Cage, you know a Faraday bag in your buddies gun safe or in your storage unit or at your office or something like that
[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:13.020]   So if you need that secondary form of communication, these are powerful ways to do it
[01:37:13.020 --> 01:37:19.220]   And so this is I've had this kind of tenuous relationship with privacy where I'm totally into it because I'm into like weird hardcore stuff
[01:37:19.220 --> 01:37:22.420]   Like that, but I find that a lot of the techniques are
[01:37:22.420 --> 01:37:28.580]   Difficult, but yet I'm really glad I'm into it because having it as a backup option has been really powerful
[01:37:28.580 --> 01:37:35.120]   And that's kind of my point is that if you're a guy who's making a good income and you don't have a private phone
[01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:37.120]   at least as a backup sitting somewhere I
[01:37:38.100 --> 01:37:40.700]   Think you're you're not planning ahead enough, right?
[01:37:40.700 --> 01:37:41.720]   if you don't have a
[01:37:41.720 --> 01:37:45.800]   place you can go and know how to go to a place where you could fall off the grid if you all of a
[01:37:45.800 --> 01:37:50.020]   Sudden we're on the front page of the newspaper. I don't think you're planning ahead well enough in the modern world
[01:37:50.020 --> 01:37:56.320]   That's that's all well said let me just say one final thing here, which is slight tangent
[01:37:56.320 --> 01:38:01.100]   But I want to make sure to say it and that is for people who think we've gone off the deep end here
[01:38:01.100 --> 01:38:05.580]   Let me get let me give you something very practical for the the wealthy listener out there
[01:38:05.580 --> 01:38:11.980]   let's say that you have your bank account and you have X amount of money in there and you have your coinbase account and you
[01:38:11.980 --> 01:38:16.920]   Have your fidelity and Vanguard accounts and you have X amount of stock in there
[01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:19.420]   the easiest thing you can do to protect that is
[01:38:19.420 --> 01:38:26.260]   To have two-factor authentication. I didn't mention this. I should have Joshua referenced it just a minute ago
[01:38:26.260 --> 01:38:31.300]   Go into your important accounts go to the settings set up two-factor authentication
[01:38:32.500 --> 01:38:40.180]   That is going to force you whenever you log in to provide a code that can be sent to your phone
[01:38:40.180 --> 01:38:45.900]   Or through an app like Authy and I recommend that you consider an app called Authy
[01:38:45.900 --> 01:38:49.840]   This is an easy way to make sure that you're not part of some of my recent clients
[01:38:49.840 --> 01:38:55.000]   Who the statistic of six trillion dollars of cybercrime per year?
[01:38:55.000 --> 01:39:01.780]   Which is growing which my clients recently have contributed to because they didn't have two-factor authentication in their important accounts
[01:39:01.900 --> 01:39:08.340]   Because they were using a Yahoo email address, which they didn't change the password and Yahoo accounts were breached a few years ago
[01:39:08.340 --> 01:39:13.420]   So there's the keys to the kingdom right there. They lose all of their coinbase money
[01:39:13.420 --> 01:39:19.380]   Just like that and you can't recover cryptocurrency. So have the two-factor authentication
[01:39:19.380 --> 01:39:27.500]   Change your email address to one that is not hackable. For example proton mail
[01:39:27.500 --> 01:39:32.060]   They do not have the credentials of their users so they cannot
[01:39:32.060 --> 01:39:38.780]   Theoretically have a breach. So go create you a proton mail email account change your important
[01:39:38.780 --> 01:39:43.460]   Financial accounts to that make sure you don't forget the password because you will be locked out for eternity
[01:39:43.460 --> 01:39:49.180]   set up your two-factor authentication and you will have just done your financial future a
[01:39:49.180 --> 01:39:51.860]   Huge benefit by making just those steps
[01:39:52.300 --> 01:39:59.740]   Absolutely. So I want to plug your book the watchman guide to privacy reclaim your digital financial and lifestyle freedom
[01:39:59.740 --> 01:40:02.300]   This book is fantastic. I
[01:40:02.300 --> 01:40:07.860]   Strongly recommend it. It's wonderful. It's a it's a really good and Gabriel
[01:40:07.860 --> 01:40:16.580]   You're very good at organizing information and you're very good at laying out kind of the philosophical underpinnings of your position and giving a good
[01:40:17.900 --> 01:40:23.540]   Introduction to people but also giving enough tidbits of how you can go deep in this book. I love this book
[01:40:23.540 --> 01:40:26.340]   I think it's great. You're also doing a podcast
[01:40:26.340 --> 01:40:33.500]   Yes, that is simply the watchman privacy podcast available pretty much anywhere including YouTube, etc
[01:40:33.500 --> 01:40:39.100]   So watchman privacy podcast and are you additionally maintaining a blog or is it most of your writing in this book?
[01:40:39.100 --> 01:40:43.540]   You can if you want to track me down get the book check out my podcast
[01:40:43.540 --> 01:40:47.900]   You can check out my website watchman privacy comm I have a newsletter
[01:40:47.900 --> 01:40:51.240]   I hope to be doing some important things with that in the upcoming year
[01:40:51.240 --> 01:40:54.860]   So those are the three ways and then Gabriel and I are working on a project
[01:40:54.860 --> 01:40:57.640]   Which we hope to be announcing the details of very soon
[01:40:57.640 --> 01:41:00.420]   about Bitcoin Bitcoin privacy, etc
[01:41:00.420 --> 01:41:02.660]   my
[01:41:02.660 --> 01:41:04.660]   Hopefully that'll be a q1
[01:41:04.660 --> 01:41:07.500]   2022 launch that was supposed to be q4
[01:41:07.500 --> 01:41:15.140]   But I've messed that up and so q1 2022 is the plan for a pretty cool Bitcoin collaborative project Gabriel
[01:41:15.140 --> 01:41:17.700]   Thank you for coming. Thank you for being on the show today. Thank you
[01:41:17.700 --> 01:41:18.520]   Thank you.
