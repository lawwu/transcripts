[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240]   It's like, oh, you know, what does it mean to be like a man in terms of like what God
[00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.840]   calls us to be like a biblical man?
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.860]   And I think it's hard to figure that out on your own.
[00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.120]   And this course does a really, really good job on like helping you understand, oh, this
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.120]   is God's will for my people.
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.480]   What's God's will for my life?
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.600]   Like as a man, well, this is what God's will for your life is.
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.780]   Not to do noblemen, right?
[00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:19.960]   But you learn what that means.
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:29.980]   Hello and welcome to the official, unofficial Acts 2 Network podcast, where we are
[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.760]   launching Lifelong Kingdom Workers from every college town.
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:33.400]   My name is Stephen.
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.760]   I'm with Isaiah.
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.640]   And today we have Antoine and David.
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.600]   Welcome, guys.
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.040]   Welcome, guys.
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.380]   Thanks for having us.
[00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:42.940]   Say hello to the internet.
[00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:43.840]   Say hello.
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:44.840]   Hello, internet.
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.420]   Well, I'm really excited to talk to you guys today.
[00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.420]   We've been wanting to talk about this for a while.
[00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.100]   We want to talk about how you guys have been leading this thing called Nobleman, which is
[00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.540]   a, I believe it's the Navigators.
[00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:56.040]   Is that right?
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.680]   Navigators created like a really cool, like men's curriculum thing.
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.820]   But before we get into that, why don't you guys just introduce yourselves?
[00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:04.920]   We can have David start.
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.560]   You can just say like where you're at right now, what ministry you're serving in.
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.320]   Some of your peers are on the network.
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.620]   And we just something like that.
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.640]   So, David and then Antoine.
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.440]   So, hello.
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.720]   My name is David.
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.400]   I am class of 2014.
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.820]   I'm over here at George Mason University or Fairfax, Virginia DMV area.
[00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.460]   So, my peers, we've got Brian Mao back in Berkeley.
[00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.220]   We have all of those Rutgers guys up at the Jersey area.
[00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.320]   I don't need to say the name.
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.440]   People already know who they are.
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.180]   We've got a lot of guys up in Boston, Sam Cho, those folks.
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.560]   And so, those are my peers.
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.620]   And I already forgot what was your follow-up question to that.
[00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.640]   Just what ministry here you're involved in?
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.240]   So, I do college ministry at George Mason University.
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.500]   And that's where I got to do nobleman.
[00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.120]   I also am a part of our inner high ministry here as well.
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.220]   So, every Sunday morning, I spend time with the youth.
[00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.600]   Double duty.
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.400]   Right.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.420]   And were you at George Mason starting 2017?
[00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.200]   Is that when you went out?
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.760]   Yeah.
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:01.340]   George Mason.
[00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.160]   I'm originally from UC Davis or the area.
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.780]   And then 2017, that great migration or the great explosion or whatever people called it.
[00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.440]   I believe it's the great scattering.
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.760]   That's our internal name.
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.540]   Awesome.
[00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.800]   Wow.
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.900]   So, seven years at Jamie.
[00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:14.420]   That's awesome.
[00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.560]   All right, Antoine.
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.940]   How about you?
[00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.600]   Yeah.
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.600]   So, my name is Antoine.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.780]   My wife and I serve at Rutgers in New Jersey.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.440]   And the ministry that we're a part of is the college ministry.
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.600]   Some of the peers around the country.
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.340]   Well, in New Jersey, we have Bat Salad, Alex Lin.
[00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.640]   I'm in California.
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.840]   There's Henry Chum.
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.940]   There's Ivan.
[00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.140]   There's Noah.
[00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.920]   Agape.
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:39.980]   Mike Jean.
[00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:40.800]   Just, oh, yeah.
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.200]   2015, there's a lot of us.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.220]   We'll just stop you there.
[00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.020]   You know, you guys don't get hurt if Antoine didn't say your name.
[00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.440]   You know.
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.600]   Cool, cool.
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.880]   So, how about you guys share a little bit of your story?
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.020]   How did you start coming out to our church?
[00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.880]   How did you become Christian?
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.040]   Or, you know, even entering into ministry?
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.480]   I know, Antoine, you have a funny story about that.
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.360]   So, why don't we start with David?
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.620]   Just how did you become?
[00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:03.760]   How did you start coming out to church?
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.140]   And you have an interesting story about that, too, actually.
[00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.160]   My story goes a little too long, though.
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.980]   The hard part is going to be how to keep it short.
[00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:10.920]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.580]   Well, just do your best.
[00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:13.080]   Do your best.
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.420]   I'll do my best to keep it short.
[00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:24.920]   In terms of how I became a Christian, I think it kind of ties it back to when I was younger and where I learned about Christianity, actually.
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.520]   And so, I come from an immigrant family.
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.880]   There's nine of us, nine kids.
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.560]   There's a lot of us, Vietnamese, Brady Bunch.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.300]   I went to foster care as a kid.
[00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.920]   And so, actually, that's where Blessing in Disguise got to live with Isaiah.
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:38.480]   Yeah.
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.380]   And his family are foster brothers.
[00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.100]   I didn't know that.
[00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.540]   We are foster brothers.
[00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:43.360]   He was the bully.
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.500]   He still owes me money.
[00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.680]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.580]   We said, you give me Madison Gardens, and I will give you a dollar when we get home.
[00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:51.500]   And a lollipop.
[00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:52.680]   And I said, okay.
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.860]   Despite my sisters all saying, don't do it, I get it.
[00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.980]   I never saw the lollipop.
[00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:06.240]   I never saw the dollar, but I got in trouble by, at that time, Auntie Kelly, because we were messing with money when we shouldn't be when we were six years old.
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.880]   The thing.
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:09.200]   But anyways.
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.020]   Never trust Isaiah again.
[00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.660]   Never trust Isaiah.
[00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:12.640]   That was not bullying.
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.280]   That was just winning a game.
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.080]   My goodness.
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.980]   Also, I just want you to know that I did that sort of thing to my brother and sister all the time.
[00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:20.740]   So, it wasn't personal.
[00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:22.940]   He just bullies indiscriminately.
[00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.660]   It was just bullying you're part of the family.
[00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.340]   But, yeah.
[00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.520]   So, it was during that time, actually, I learned about the gospel.
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.180]   I actually attribute a lot to, like, at that time, though I might not have became a Christian at that time.
[00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.200]   The mere concept that I could actually say, oh, there's a God.
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:38.820]   This God loves me.
[00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.020]   I could pray to this God.
[00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.520]   And this is a long story.
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.260]   But eventually, there was a time in my life when I was 15.
[00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.240]   I was in a very big pigsty in my life.
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.000]   I got involved with the wrong crowd.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   I made a lot of mistakes.
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.280]   There was a moment in which I cried out to God.
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.500]   And I was asked God if He could rescue me from my situation.
[00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.140]   And I'm like, how did I know to do that in the midst of, in that moment?
[00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.820]   And it's because of what I learned about God when I was a kid.
[00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.000]   And this is after I came back to my family and everything.
[00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:13.760]   So I think at that point, God started to bring people into my life, other Christians who would continue to share with me the gospel, help me to understand who God was.
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:22.340]   And so eventually, when I moved to Davis, because I needed to kind of get out of my situation, my sister, Amy, Amy Kinder, shout out to her, Godly Women.
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.540]   She was able to kind of hook me up with a place, talking to some of our pastors and living in Davis.
[00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.160]   And that's where I got exposed to our church.
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:37.660]   And I think that was the space I needed to understand the gospel, go to church, see it lived out in community.
[00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.460]   I was like, wow, these people are so weird.
[00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:40.800]   They have lock boxes.
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.700]   That was the thing, because I came, we don't want access to your house.
[00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.700]   But there was lock boxes everywhere.
[00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.960]   And people were like, oh, just going into Pastor Johnson's garage and grabbing things.
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.120]   I was like, this is so strange.
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.040]   Yeah.
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.660]   Yeah, it was that year and then that summer when I made my decision.
[00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.360]   I don't know if we have time to go into the message.
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.880]   Anyways, August 29th, you know, I just made my decision and the rest was history.
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:07.240]   And I think because it was like that college age where my life was transformed and I was saved.
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.040]   And I was like, man, you know, I want this.
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.760]   I don't want to continue.
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.880]   I want to help other people experience God like this.
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:17.220]   And so I always saw myself as like, I'm going to be one of the staff members one day.
[00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:20.000]   And lo and behold, I guess that's what happened.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.240]   And then when church planning came, I'm like, sign me up.
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.040]   And then great scattering.
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.400]   Nice.
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.020]   Yeah.
[00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:32.380]   You know, when I when I first saw the lock boxes as a college, I was like, whoa, this is weird.
[00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:33.420]   Yeah.
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:37.660]   I mean, did you ever have a lock box on your your apartment, house, whatever?
[00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:38.460]   Do you have one?
[00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.660]   Well, I have one now.
[00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:44.060]   I thought we stopped doing that.
[00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:44.700]   I thought we stopped.
[00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:45.300]   We stopped.
[00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:46.220]   I thought we stopped.
[00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:50.860]   Same as everyone knows that, you know, the assumption was like, don't do it.
[00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.040]   And everyone uses the same password.
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:52.980]   But no, I'm just kidding.
[00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.940]   My my my my my camera went crazy.
[00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:57.720]   Let me keep doing this.
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.780]   Isaiah, do you want to clarify what lock boxes are?
[00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:02.820]   Yeah, we probably should.
[00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:03.480]   Yeah.
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:08.240]   If you I don't know what the common practice is now, but yeah, it was just it was just back
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.440]   in the day we would access, you know, we didn't have like that many buildings and stuff.
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:17.360]   So often like, you know, sports equipment or stuff for outreach is sort of people different
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:17.960]   people's houses.
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:23.280]   And so we just made it a practice to have a key, you know, with a combo on the outside so
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:24.080]   someone can get in.
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.780]   And it was sort of a way in which I don't know.
[00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.560]   It didn't strike me as weird because I grew up with it.
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.320]   But yeah, it is.
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:30.740]   It is weird when you think about it.
[00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:31.020]   Yeah.
[00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:34.240]   Like all these people are just willing to give other people access to their house.
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.120]   So.
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.300]   Yeah.
[00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.000]   I think it's pretty neat.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:38.580]   Yeah.
[00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:42.400]   I think it's pretty neat because like it was church people giving up like their garage space so that
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.760]   yeah, we could store church supplies and stuff there.
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:51.820]   But yeah, I think it's our like church grew and it was like random people kind of people
[00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:56.100]   we didn't quite know coming into your like we should probably and then we got a church
[00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:57.980]   building and we're like, OK, that's that we're good now.
[00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:01.240]   It's a little different when you have a church of, you know, 200 versus 2,000.
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:01.820]   So yeah.
[00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:02.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.400]   And it's like, yeah, just go to that person's house and grab that thing.
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.360]   And you're like, what?
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.300]   Cool.
[00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:08.740]   Cool.
[00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:09.500]   Well, that's one.
[00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:10.000]   How about you?
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.100]   How'd you strike them to our church?
[00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:16.200]   How'd you, you have a very interesting story in terms of like deciding to do college
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.300]   ministry, you know?
[00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:20.880]   So maybe you could talk a little about that, your spiritual background in that.
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.220]   Yeah.
[00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:22.800]   Oh, man.
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:23.960]   There's so much to say.
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.940]   But anyways, we'll start from somewhat the beginning.
[00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:33.660]   I grew up, I would say I grew up going to church, but not necessarily grew up.
[00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:35.540]   I'm like a super strong Christian.
[00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:39.520]   Things started to develop in high school where I was, I ran into a church.
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:42.800]   I was baptized there, first pilgrim in Los Angeles.
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:48.020]   But I really wasn't taking it seriously because I didn't know the ins and outs of what it meant
[00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:49.000]   to be a Christian.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.880]   And because of that, I was just sort of making up my own thing.
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:09:00.140]   Like, oh, God would want me to, you know, do X, Y, or Z because that's just, you know,
[00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:03.400]   what, what just what people would do anyway.
[00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:06.500]   So a little confusing, sorry about explaining on that.
[00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:13.680]   But anyways, when I made it to college, I had the opportunity to really seek out a church.
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.260]   I ran into some random coupon guy at a supermarket.
[00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:21.420]   And long story short, he convinced me that when I'd finally go to college, I should check
[00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:21.920]   out a church.
[00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:28.100]   And so I wrote it down as last on my list of things to do, because I was a junior transfer.
[00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:32.060]   So, you know, and so then I was like, find a church group.
[00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:32.940]   Last on my list.
[00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:35.500]   Wasn't planning on like seeking it too heavy.
[00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:39.700]   Lo and behold, though, I find it on the very first day I land on campus.
[00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:43.680]   UC Riverside, we have a thing called Block Party, which kicks off the school year.
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.140]   And I was at that campus.
[00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:46.680]   I met some friends.
[00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:48.020]   They were pre-gaming.
[00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:49.860]   They were not around.
[00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:51.440]   And so I felt really self-conscious.
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.840]   And so I just kept standing in the longest lines possible.
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:56.740]   So I didn't look like a loner.
[00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:00.860]   I went to all these people around and it just turned up and I was standing in the Korean barbecue
[00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:03.820]   line that, you know, it turns out that our church was putting on.
[00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:05.600]   I bought my first Korean barbecue.
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:09.940]   So everybody who had free Korean barbecue, as they're like intro to our church, I'm really
[00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:10.260]   jealous.
[00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.240]   I bought it with like, it was like 12 bucks too.
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:15.620]   Anyways, but it was good.
[00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:16.360]   It was good.
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:21.240]   In that line, Dennis Plescott, he fired to me because we were fired to people in that
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:21.600]   line.
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.520]   And so from there, I just joined.
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:28.840]   And I think the thing that stuck out most about our church in those days is that people
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:32.080]   actually served God to a fault.
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.800]   Like it was detrimental to them.
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:35.660]   It was painful.
[00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:41.000]   It was hard to keep up with this lifestyle, but they would still do it.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.160]   They would still sacrifice.
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:43.140]   They'd still give.
[00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:49.000]   I was used to seeing Christians who, once things got hard, you just sort of like, you
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.740]   know, make things a little easier for you by compromising or backing down.
[00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:55.740]   And so that was amazing to see day in, day out.
[00:10:55.740 --> 00:11:02.880]   And when it comes to come my senior year, I remember really not wanting to join college
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:03.340]   ministry.
[00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:06.880]   And I even told my mentor at the time, he's Jasper Chang.
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:11.220]   I was like, hey, Jasper, you know, I really don't want to join college ministry.
[00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:13.920]   And I just don't think it's for me, you know?
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:17.540]   And then he responds by saying, yeah, I don't think you should join either.
[00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:18.720]   I'm like, what?
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:22.340]   That is not the right answer, sir.
[00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:26.160]   He's supposed to try to convince me and beg me and tell me all these Bible verses.
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:31.860]   But yeah, I mean, it just showed me that he was really thinking about me, my situation,
[00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:37.680]   and really just looking out for what I needed at the time spiritually, because, you know,
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:41.340]   you're not supposed to just dive in to do something like ultra crazy.
[00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:45.240]   If you know you're not at the place, you're going to become bitter and all that good stuff.
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:49.800]   So that's a little bit of why I decided to join college ministry in the first place.
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.160]   And yeah.
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:52.980]   So it was a couple of years, right?
[00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:54.540]   Like you did other ministries.
[00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:58.220]   Did you jump into college right away or after that conversation?
[00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:01.300]   So I did a youth ministry first.
[00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:02.080]   Oh, okay.
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.980]   But it was only for like a semester.
[00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:04.980]   Okay.
[00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:07.860]   And then you were like, let's go call it.
[00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:09.840]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:12.680]   People brought up to me because I did this.
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:20.060]   It's very similar to how some of the new grads are kind of easing into ministry here.
[00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:20.400]   Yeah.
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:25.560]   They allowed me to be in inter-high while at the same time helping out with college.
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.460]   And that was around 2015, 2016.
[00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:29.720]   And so, yeah.
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.060]   So easing into it, yeah.
[00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:31.140]   Yeah.
[00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:39.200]   I remember, man, back in the day, Isaiah, when you and I would join college, it was just like you just get thrown right into it.
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:42.340]   And it was like sink or swim kind of feel.
[00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:43.180]   But it was good.
[00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:43.600]   It was good.
[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:46.120]   I remember thinking at the end of my first year.
[00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.920]   I don't know.
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:50.560]   Like, would I do that again?
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:51.960]   I think I would.
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:54.120]   Like, yeah, yeah.
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:57.180]   You know, I'm glad it was hard, but I'm glad it happened.
[00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:58.800]   Like, that's kind of how I felt at the end.
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:12:59.580]   But yeah.
[00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.020]   That was my senior year, I think.
[00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:01.640]   That was your senior year.
[00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:02.840]   First year, I really loved.
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:03.720]   Okay.
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.620]   You know, it's a really good class.
[00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:06.720]   Oh, you were in law school.
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:08.560]   Oh, that was my second year.
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:09.240]   Second year.
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:09.520]   Anyway.
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:09.860]   Got it.
[00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:10.760]   Cool.
[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:11.940]   All right.
[00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:14.180]   Well, let's jump into talking about noblemen, guys.
[00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:16.300]   Because I think that, you know, that is the main thing we want to talk about.
[00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:19.120]   So, what is noblemen?
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.060]   Let's just start with that.
[00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:22.180]   David, you want to just kick us off?
[00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:23.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:29.660]   Well, the pamphlet says noblemen is an application-rich discipleship course that offers a compelling
[00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:31.680]   biblical path to true manhood and impact.
[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:34.280]   And, well, that's a pamphlet.
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:35.920]   In terms of, and that's true.
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:39.420]   But from my experience, I just kind of expand on that a little bit.
[00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:44.060]   It's like, oh, you know, what does it mean to be like a man in terms of like what God
[00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:45.640]   calls us to be like a biblical man?
[00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:48.680]   And I think it's hard to figure that out on your own.
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:53.180]   And this course does a really, really good job on like helping you understand, oh, this
[00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:54.060]   is God's will for me.
[00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:55.560]   People are like, what's God's will for my life?
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:57.660]   Like as a man, well, this is what God's will for your life is.
[00:13:57.660 --> 00:13:58.860]   Not to do noblemen, right?
[00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:00.880]   But you learn what that means, right?
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:02.660]   How to relate with other men, right?
[00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:06.180]   And how to, like, when it comes to things like community, what does that look like?
[00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:09.580]   What is your role when it comes to community and the church, building up the church?
[00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:14.100]   What is it, what is like godly relationships look like with other men, older and younger
[00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:14.900]   and your peer?
[00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:19.600]   Um, so a lot of good stuff, even like maybe they're not ready for that yet, but then around
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:25.900]   like marriage, like as a father, like how should you be responding to your wife and your kids?
[00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:26.800]   And what does that look like?
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.000]   So it was really awesome.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.060]   Um, and I think so it's, it's good, like biblical manhood content, but what, like, what's the
[00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:35.780]   format and like what else is involved with it?
[00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:39.460]   Yeah, so what happens is, so it's a combination of things.
[00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:41.360]   So two of it will be a weekly.
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:46.660]   So, uh, so we meet weekly, uh, for sessions where we get together and we kind of go through
[00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:50.560]   some content together about like different values, principles, that kind of thing.
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:53.140]   But on top of that, we do challenges, right?
[00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:54.380]   And that look cool.
[00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:58.180]   So some of those challenges will range from like writing a letter to your father, right?
[00:14:58.180 --> 00:14:59.720]   Like, well, who's done that before?
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.520]   Wow.
[00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:05.520]   Even, uh, like outreaching salty groups, finding a group of people where you can kind of discuss
[00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:08.120]   spiritual conversations with, with those things.
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:14.320]   We also have three big events or, um, not events, trips going.
[00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:14.780]   Yeah.
[00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:20.240]   So launch week is the first week we go into it and that's where we kind of kick things off
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:21.460]   together as like a cohort.
[00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:22.400]   And we do this together.
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:26.300]   Uh, we have our boost trip mid week, our mid semester.
[00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:28.980]   And at the end, there's something called fort week.
[00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:33.240]   We won't go too much detail into that, but then fort week is what you want to get the
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:33.840]   whole time.
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:36.740]   You're trying to just accumulate or just keep your points.
[00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:37.360]   Okay.
[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:39.220]   Cause when you don't do yours, you lose points.
[00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:42.060]   So you want to get a certain amount of points so you can make into fort week.
[00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:43.800]   Cause that is super awesome.
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:48.760]   And that's usually, that's like 75% of like the transformation you experience through
[00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:49.880]   courses for a week.
[00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:54.920]   So, and then I, so I also heard that there's like daily calls and daily Bible reading.
[00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:56.940]   Like you have something, man, is that?
[00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:57.660]   Yeah.
[00:15:57.660 --> 00:15:59.240]   I can take that.
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:15:59.960]   So yeah.
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:03.160]   One thing about nobleman is the every single dayness.
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:06.720]   I think dailiness is like not even descriptive enough.
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:07.860]   Every single day.
[00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:08.380]   Wow.
[00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:13.080]   You are calling a person, your wingman, who you get paired up with the changes every week.
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:18.240]   It's somebody was sitting in the group and you're also doing daily Bible readings Monday
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:18.920]   through Sunday.
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:24.720]   And yeah, you're talking about that, you know, praying over things with your wingman every
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:25.340]   single day.
[00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:29.880]   And, um, that's on top of the assignments that you have to do or the sessions that you
[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:30.660]   have to join.
[00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:35.180]   And that's really creates a lot of bonding between the guys.
[00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:37.640]   Um, we're going to be student and student and lead.
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:38.880]   Wow.
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:42.500]   Sounds like, um, I mean, it's more than just content, the local men and content.
[00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:48.540]   It's really trying to create like a, forge a group together around a lot of work.
[00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:49.840]   Actually, there's a lot of stuff.
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:50.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:50.920]   It's a lot.
[00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:51.940]   It sounds like you have to do a lot.
[00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:54.560]   Is that, I mean, is that, it's a pretty high bar?
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:55.100]   Yeah.
[00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:56.480]   It is a pretty high bar.
[00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:56.940]   Actually.
[00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:59.380]   It'll say like, so we have to memorize this creed, right?
[00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:02.320]   So you have the creed, we can talk about the creed later if we want, but like every
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:06.620]   session you'll come in and be like, Oh, if you don't recite this word perfect, you
[00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:07.700]   don't get the points, you know?
[00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:10.180]   And so there are moments like, Oh, you see me.
[00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:13.420]   And then, you know, as I'm reciting it, you know, I get one word wrong.
[00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:13.660]   Right.
[00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:15.800]   And then another student recites, he gets one word wrong.
[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:18.560]   And then these other students are like, Hey, just give it to him.
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:21.000]   You know, it's like just one word.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.060]   And I'm like, Hey man, we just gotta, just gotta look at this, you know?
[00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:26.420]   And it says, um, we're perfect.
[00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:30.920]   So I'm going to hold myself to, I didn't get points, you know?
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:35.120]   And then one student, this is kind of funny, Steven, because it was a message that you
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:38.460]   helped to prepare about like the heart of the law, which I gave that Sunday.
[00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:45.300]   But the law, David, you know, and I was like, Hey, you know, I think their heart is that like
[00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:47.420]   we keep to the structure, right?
[00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:51.080]   Because the structure will help us grow and the hard work of working towards that is going
[00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:51.440]   to help us.
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:53.340]   So, but that was, that was a fun incident.
[00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:58.300]   The structure as well as just honoring the exact word of God, because it's not just the
[00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:02.360]   creed, you got to memorize word perfect, but every scripture that we have to memorize, it
[00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:03.840]   needs to be word perfect as well.
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:07.300]   Well, so it is, yeah, it's a very high bar.
[00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:11.720]   And I mean, I was, I was not involved in Nobleman, but two of the staff that I'm mentoring were
[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:14.280]   part of Nobleman and was like, I never saw them, man.
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:15.240]   It was, it was busy.
[00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:21.120]   So I'm wondering like the process of like getting students involved in this, like, I mean, A,
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:23.180]   do they know what they're signing up for?
[00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:27.380]   And B, if they do know, how do you convince like a busy college student, like we're having
[00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:29.920]   trouble just getting people to come to Bible study, you know, like how do you get someone
[00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:31.060]   to sign up for something like this?
[00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:32.660]   Yeah.
[00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:35.380]   Um, well, I'll just share a quick thought.
[00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:37.660]   Maybe Antoine, you could share about like the process.
[00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:42.780]   I wonder, like, you know, it's kind of weird because you'd have students who are like irregular,
[00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:44.880]   maybe like last year.
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.080]   Just the value of like a consistent Bible study.
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:53.660]   Maybe that's not like as valuable, but then when you share, Oh, Hey, there's a men's biblical
[00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:57.860]   discipleship group that on the other side of that, you will have a transformed relationship
[00:18:57.860 --> 00:18:59.960]   with God and with other people.
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:04.820]   The way that I tell people, I'm like, Hey, this is probably the biggest investment into your
[00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:07.840]   relationship with God as a man that you can do this semester.
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:12.760]   I don't know about anything else that if you do this, you're not going to come out
[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:15.040]   of it going, Oh, I wish I, I've not met anyone yet.
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:16.180]   That's like, I wish I didn't do that.
[00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:21.980]   But then we actually had a one guy and he knows who he is.
[00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:24.000]   So if you're listening, I love you.
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:28.920]   And, uh, we have a great relationship hung out with him at FH workday today, but yeah,
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:33.800]   so he, he was like the, just a semester before it came back in and meet our group transform.
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:34.720]   We're 180 now.
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:35.520]   We're not make new.
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:40.840]   And then he was like, I think I know these people, you know, I think I know familiar,
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:43.860]   but I don't know, but he's been in our group like before.
[00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:44.780]   And then, so it's so funny.
[00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:47.300]   And then, but that spring he said, Oh, I'll do local man.
[00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:51.500]   And, and he went through that and he'll, he'll be the first one to testify.
[00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:54.740]   Like, Hey, this was like, like, this was an answer to prayer for him.
[00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:55.840]   He's like, I'm graduating.
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:58.640]   What does God want for my life before I graduate?
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:00.620]   And we're like, Hey guys, we're doing nobleman.
[00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:01.640]   He's like, Oh, this is it.
[00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:01.980]   You know?
[00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:05.200]   And he did nobleman and man, big proponents for nobleman for sure.
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:05.840]   Wow.
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:09.100]   I just see him one day, maybe doing his own nobleman, a group as well.
[00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:12.300]   So, so what, what do you think is the draw for people?
[00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:15.300]   Is it the fact that it's like a men's thing?
[00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:20.180]   Is it the fact that it's intense or like, is it the promise of like, Hey, there will be
[00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:21.800]   progress in your spiritual life.
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:24.040]   Cause I'm kind of hearing a couple of different things from you, but what do you think is,
[00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:24.780]   yeah.
[00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:26.200]   What, what, what is the draw for people?
[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:28.120]   I think it's across the board.
[00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:32.400]   When I asked our guys who went through Rutgers, I asked each and every one of them, Hey, why
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:33.440]   did you join Rutgers?
[00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:36.100]   I mean, how did you join Nobleman?
[00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:38.920]   And what made you stay in Nobleman?
[00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:41.180]   All of them had actually a slightly different reason.
[00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:43.420]   They were, they kind of scattered around what you said.
[00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:45.140]   Some wanted the challenge.
[00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:49.880]   Some knew that they needed to take a step to grow closer to God.
[00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:54.480]   Some just really wanted the camaraderie with the other guys.
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:21:00.980]   Some kind of missed the type of frat life that they, that they wanted to pursue before.
[00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:03.000]   And this kind of fit that bill.
[00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:05.200]   And so it was all over the place.
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:11.920]   I do think that when we were pitching Nobleman at Rutgers, what didn't work was when we were
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:18.880]   trying to pitch it as like a really hard thing that you need to like defeat and, and, and
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:19.380]   overcome.
[00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:23.860]   When we talked about Legwisks, you have points, you can get kicked out.
[00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:26.200]   There's all these different things that you have to meet.
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:28.560]   You know, people didn't sound that attractive.
[00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:29.060]   Yeah.
[00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:30.640]   You're pretty strange.
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:34.840]   As soon as we started talking about like the vision, like kind of like what David was saying
[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:39.480]   earlier, like one day you're going to be a father, you're going to be a husband, you're
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:41.860]   going to be somebody's last remaining best friend.
[00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:48.660]   Like, don't you want to invest right now in a life that will help you do that well in the
[00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:52.280]   future, um, to live a noble life in that way.
[00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:56.480]   And that was way more appealing and people really responded to that.
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:00.480]   So is that like part of what they like?
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:03.840]   Cause I know they break down a lot for you and know, in the no man curriculum, like, is
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:06.040]   the way you pitch it also like included?
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:08.300]   Like, do they tell you how to explain it and how to pitch it?
[00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:11.600]   And cause I heard you guys like try to scare people off, like in the beginning and it's
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:13.780]   like just sort of like a couple of info sessions or something.
[00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:14.540]   So tell us about that.
[00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:17.760]   Yeah, I can, I can kick off and then pass it to David.
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:19.400]   So yeah, there is an info session.
[00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:25.160]   The way that we did it at Rutgers was we didn't invite anyone to join nobleman.
[00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:30.260]   Actually, we invite you to come to the info session to learn about nobleman.
[00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:32.480]   Even if you said, Hey, I want to join right now.
[00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:33.000]   Hold it.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:33.360]   Nope.
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:34.700]   You're going to go to the info session.
[00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:35.940]   You're going to decide to dance.
[00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:41.280]   And we, I was doing my best to make sure everyone knew exactly what they were getting
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:47.340]   into, even so much as to, at the end of the info session, our group, we printed these letters.
[00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:52.780]   We, we knew who was signed up to show up and we printed them all these letters in faith that
[00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:53.480]   they would show up.
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:54.980]   It was in their little folder.
[00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:57.140]   And we said, Hey, read this tonight.
[00:22:57.140 --> 00:23:03.160]   And, um, yeah, it's going to give you some insight about, um, you know, how you can join and how
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:04.020]   you can opt in.
[00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:10.360]   And the way to opt in was in that letter and the way to opt out was in that letter, but
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:11.680]   they didn't call us.
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:14.420]   We weren't hounding them like, Hey, so are you coming or not?
[00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:15.440]   Like we didn't do any of that.
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:19.540]   It's like, if you do the thing that's in that letter, that's how we know.
[00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:23.520]   And lo and behold, the vast majority of them did that thing in a letter.
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:25.940]   Are you allowed to tell us what that thing is?
[00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:26.360]   Okay.
[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:28.480]   There's like all this secrecy.
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:29.020]   Yeah, I know.
[00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:29.480]   I know.
[00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:33.440]   It's like, yeah, it's like, yeah, like they're not allowed to talk about it.
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:34.600]   Like there's two rules.
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:35.860]   Can't talk about no woman.
[00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:37.560]   Did you do that info session?
[00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:38.720]   Did you guys do something like that too, David?
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:42.600]   I just want to say Antoine got creative because that's not part of it at all.
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:43.280]   The whole letter.
[00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:43.680]   I see.
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:45.200]   That sounds really cool.
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:45.920]   That sounds cool.
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:47.000]   I should have tried that.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:52.180]   But in terms of like an interest meeting, like for us, yeah, it's kind of that similar
[00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:52.420]   feel.
[00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:55.940]   You want to invite them so that they can learn and be very clear about like what's the
[00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:59.260]   commitment and the commitment level is, Hey, you're going to expect five hours of commitment
[00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:00.940]   per week on average five hours.
[00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:02.260]   What's neat about it.
[00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:06.400]   Well, just kind of break down for any like staff that are like thinking about doing it, right?
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.700]   Like in terms of what's offered, I think about like,
[00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:10.760]   I said, uh, low burden, high impact.
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:11.200]   Okay.
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:15.720]   And when I think about this curriculum, cause they do offer like a leader guide and the
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:19.960]   guy, his name is Bryce Burchard, amazing guy, but he, he's like, Hey, yeah, you know, I made
[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:22.220]   it so that like, I used to do college ministry.
[00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:24.640]   Cause he was actually called the staff for Davis.
[00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:28.260]   And he's like, I understand sometimes you're like the day before your meeting, you're like,
[00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:29.420]   what the, what are we doing?
[00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:29.620]   Right.
[00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:34.300]   And so he built it that way such that you can open up your guide and be like, this is exactly
[00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:35.400]   what we're doing tomorrow.
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:39.120]   So that it's, it's low prep, but high impact.
[00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:43.520]   A lot of the prep comes into the events, but for the interest meeting, yeah, they give you
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:47.920]   a breakdown of all the things that you can talk about and to kind of help you to help them
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:48.440]   understand.
[00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:53.220]   Not only is this valuable to you, but you do have the time, you have the time.
[00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:56.160]   I've heard also that they've like iterated on it multiple times.
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:57.600]   So it's not like you're getting their first draft.
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:00.640]   You're getting like their, no, this is proven kind of plans.
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:00.960]   All right.
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:03.900]   I think we're, we're, they've done it for 10 years, at least now.
[00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:07.880]   Um, so when we got, I think it was around 10 years, they've been doing it.
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:09.260]   So yeah.
[00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:14.860]   Antoine, I remember, I remember you telling me how, like you learn, I can trust this content
[00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:16.140]   and you were kind of telling me about that.
[00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:19.060]   Tell us a little bit about, about that, how like that experience.
[00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:24.540]   So, um, every now and then, because like, you know, being in our church, you, you get
[00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:29.340]   used to running an event here and there, icebreakers game, I'm the icebreaker guy, you know?
[00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:33.740]   So when that's true, I read, he's the master of games.
[00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:34.020]   Yeah.
[00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:42.180]   When I read in, you know, one of the sessions for the trip, um, the launch trip gives you
[00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:47.020]   an icebreaker that you can do and it tells you kind of specifically what to say.
[00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:48.580]   And it says like, guys love me.
[00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:53.560]   And when I first read that, I was like, man, man, I can come up with like way better icebreaker
[00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:56.320]   than that, but I, but I didn't.
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:57.340]   And so I was like, you know what?
[00:25:57.340 --> 00:25:58.820]   I need to just rely on it.
[00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:03.360]   I talked with, uh, John Kim and he was like, Hey, just try to stick to it as close as possible.
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:04.960]   It's like, okay, I'm going to do it.
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:09.640]   And lo and behold, that icebreaker like lit the room up.
[00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:11.760]   They were like chatting and talking.
[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:17.060]   It was something simple, but it's like that icebreaker after that specific session, after
[00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:20.360]   that conversation was really, really good for that moment.
[00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:21.600]   And so, wow.
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:22.740]   Yeah.
[00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:27.760]   Well, Hey, maybe in the next iteration, they can, uh, incorporate your letter idea into the,
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:29.040]   uh, the info session.
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:30.980]   And so, you know, like that, that's pretty cool.
[00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:33.420]   So it's a lot of work.
[00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:37.820]   It's a lot of like, just, you know, you guys look, sound really excited about it now, but,
[00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:39.800]   but how did you guys feel going into it?
[00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:41.300]   Like, did you, were you, were you excited?
[00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:45.900]   Were you like, you know, like, yeah, just tell us a little about that.
[00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:47.040]   Yeah.
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:49.400]   I think cause we had heard about it.
[00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:51.380]   So a lot of the staff, you guys might've been there too.
[00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:53.320]   They went to the EDM conference that year.
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:58.680]   They went to, um, I guess he had Bryce Brashardi had a, an event thing he was doing and then
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:26:59.280]   they heard about it.
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:00.660]   Pastor Will was like, Oh, we got to try this.
[00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:02.280]   And so he kind of passed it down.
[00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:07.360]   And most of us were like, nah, you know, cause it just like, we had our plans.
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:07.680]   Right.
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:12.300]   And, um, luckily, you know, Adele, um, so he runs our college group, Pastor Will, they're
[00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:14.160]   like, Hey, we should just give it a try if you can.
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.900]   And we're like, okay, well, let's just give it a shot.
[00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:18.500]   And that probably was the best thing to have.
[00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:22.640]   Like one of the best things that happened to our college ministry as a whole, that we decided
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:23.040]   to do it.
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:28.600]   So I came in and kind of, so me and Fred Mote, so shout out to him because he, if it wasn't
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:30.600]   for him, I don't think it would have turned out as well.
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:32.560]   He's like the backbone of your planet.
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:34.020]   He's the logistics dude.
[00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:35.020]   You know, you need those people.
[00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:36.500]   It made it happen.
[00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:36.880]   Yeah.
[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:41.500]   So he, um, we, we were really kind of nervous about it because also for like a, well, we
[00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:45.740]   got our own DTs, you know, we do our own devotions with our church and it's like, Oh, we got
[00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:47.880]   to do another devotions, you know?
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:50.060]   And it's this whole separate devotions.
[00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:50.280]   Right.
[00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:55.380]   And wait on Saturday and Sundays too, you know, it's like, yeah, you know, you go to church and
[00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:57.300]   they're more intense than us, man.
[00:27:57.300 --> 00:28:00.800]   It's too much waiting things for a retreat.
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:01.340]   Yeah.
[00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:02.240]   You still got a call.
[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:05.040]   But it was, what was cool is you, you see this.
[00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:06.980]   Um, I mean, yeah.
[00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:10.540]   So there's this experience of, Oh, we're at a, um, we're at an outing.
[00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:11.600]   We're in New York outing.
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:12.400]   We're at river lodge.
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:13.100]   We're hanging out.
[00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:17.140]   And these guys are waking up at 6am before everyone wakes up to do their DT and do their
[00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:17.620]   wingman calls.
[00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:18.540]   Wow.
[00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:23.500]   People see that you're like, Oh, what are they doing on Sunday after church?
[00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:27.340]   I mean, you should be hanging out with newcomers, but Hey, you know, they're doing their wingman
[00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:28.060]   calls at the end.
[00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:30.900]   That's great.
[00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:35.100]   Um, so it was, it was like, Oh yeah, you know, it's different.
[00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:36.560]   We're not used to this.
[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:40.680]   Like we took all the people, like it was separated and made a whole different group.
[00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:42.180]   What does that do to group dynamics?
[00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:48.500]   And we weren't ready for that, but, uh, what came out of it, uh, man, it was, uh, it affected
[00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:50.620]   us as a whole in terms of our ministry.
[00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:55.120]   And so, um, yeah, at the time it was a lot of work, but yeah, definitely it was worth it
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:55.760]   to go through it.
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:57.760]   What, what do you think it built into the ministry?
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:58.620]   Like, what do you think it did?
[00:28:58.620 --> 00:28:59.780]   Okay.
[00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:04.200]   Well, I think what it definitely helped was like in terms of culture and things that we're
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:04.820]   going to value.
[00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:09.120]   So when we came into the fall, you have, so let's think like, you got guys who came
[00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:13.800]   out of a program that said, Hey, you got to value older mentors and, and, and godly men
[00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:14.940]   to pour into your life.
[00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:19.820]   God has called you to go and do outreach to find younger men to mentor and to become a
[00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:21.280]   spiritual patriarch for them.
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:26.120]   So these guys are coming out of that with this like mentality, like this fall, we're going
[00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:27.980]   to go and we're going to reach this campus.
[00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:34.360]   So, um, that kind of, I think this kind of lifted up the level of, of, of zeal of our
[00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:35.360]   entire group.
[00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:40.400]   Uh, so I think by the end of our semester, we never would imagine at GMU, we'd have something
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:41.760]   called campus changers, right?
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:46.820]   And that's like Vanguard kind of group where weekly we're going out and we're doing evangelism
[00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:48.280]   as our students that are driving it.
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:48.820]   Right.
[00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:50.760]   And it's momentum that that creates.
[00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:51.880]   It's amazing.
[00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:53.340]   So I was really thankful for that.
[00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:54.240]   I think we lost Antoine.
[00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:55.340]   I think we did.
[00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:56.440]   I think we lost Antoine.
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:58.560]   Antoine, what do you think?
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:29:59.140]   Antoine.
[00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:02.680]   Did you, did you enjoy it?
[00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:04.320]   He really didn't want to answer this question.
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:04.780]   Cool.
[00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:05.280]   Cool.
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:09.140]   Well, um, what, what has it done for you personally?
[00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:09.700]   Yeah.
[00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:11.360]   I think it did a lot.
[00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:11.780]   It helped me.
[00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:12.720]   I think I understood.
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:16.180]   I got to, it's like almost like another MBS for myself.
[00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:18.100]   You know, I had to, a lot of reflection.
[00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:20.100]   I think this Nobleman Creed definitely helped me.
[00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:23.780]   Uh, specifically when I just talked about like the creed itself, like there's certain parts
[00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:24.380]   of the creed.
[00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:28.440]   So some of the creed is like, I will stride, uh, I will abide daily in the Lord and in
[00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:28.840]   his word.
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:31.520]   Uh, it's like, oh yeah, I have to commit to that.
[00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:33.340]   But then, you know, you realize like, that's important, right?
[00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:35.180]   Daily, just abiding with God.
[00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:39.540]   The big one is like around my relationship with like my wife and my kid.
[00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:43.360]   I remember there was a moment where like, I was just super busy, but there's my son playing
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:43.980]   on the floor.
[00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:46.940]   And I was just like, I just need to get on my laptop and get stuff done.
[00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:51.020]   But I remember it was like, oh, you know, I'm going to remain emotionally engaged and
[00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:54.480]   physically available, you know, as a, if married, this is what I'll do for
[00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:54.820]   my family.
[00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:57.600]   And so I remember that, like going through my mind, I'm like, oh yeah, you know, actually
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:58.880]   this was God's call for my life.
[00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:02.540]   And so it was like my moment to kind of refocus, like, hey, you know what?
[00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:03.880]   I don't need to do those things.
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:05.740]   I could be available for my son right now.
[00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:10.400]   Um, there are other things like, you know, when it comes to like my wife, like, hey, um,
[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:11.260]   and I'm just going to read it.
[00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:13.380]   I will love my wife as Christ loved his church.
[00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:17.360]   I will pursue her heart and receive her strength and weaknesses until parted by death.
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:21.100]   And that, that, that strength and weaknesses part, you know, and we know this all comes
[00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:24.060]   from like the Bible, but, uh, it's just one of those things that comes, it reminds
[00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:28.040]   me like, God, oh, you know, like my wife, she's going through some health issues and
[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:30.140]   those kinds of things at that time that was coming up a lot.
[00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:33.160]   And that leads to frustrations, like things I want to do or whatnot.
[00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:35.460]   And the moments where I just got, you know what?
[00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:38.120]   Like God calls me to receive her strength.
[00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:40.540]   And are we, and this is a moment, yes, I'm going to receive that.
[00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:42.580]   So it really helped me in those areas.
[00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:47.280]   And then also in terms of like my relationship within the church and how I viewed, like where
[00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:49.540]   I was in terms of station and status.
[00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:53.520]   And because that's like so much drama and ego, but another part of it is, and it's
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:55.840]   always, it's tied to Philippians two, right.
[00:31:55.840 --> 00:32:00.100]   Um, but it's about like seeking the honor of God and those around me rather than my own.
[00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:02.540]   And that's like what talks about in terms of Jesus.
[00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:07.460]   So that really helped me to just see like, you know, I'm at my best when I just seek the
[00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:10.920]   honor of my friends instead of my mom's like competing or something or seek the honor of
[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:12.480]   it, um, or leading.
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:12.880]   Right.
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:13.960]   And so that helped a lot.
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:15.580]   And then I got to experience the fruits of that.
[00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:16.560]   And that was great.
[00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:22.400]   And that, I think if it wasn't for this, um, I think I wouldn't have grown as much in
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:23.260]   that as I could.
[00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:24.960]   Yeah.
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:25.380]   That's neat.
[00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:29.940]   Just like the power of memorization, you're just having that read in your mind and just
[00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:35.160]   the verses and rising and that they're coming to mind and those kinds of like, you know,
[00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:37.120]   defining like those moments of truth, you know?
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:38.500]   So I like that a lot.
[00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:39.200]   Yeah.
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:40.880]   Yeah.
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:41.360]   That's cool.
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:45.500]   I remember one of my, one of the staff who was part of, um, Nobleman.
[00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:46.280]   Yeah.
[00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:50.900]   He was telling me at a midway through, he's like, man, I feel like every one of our guys
[00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:52.100]   staff should go through Nobleman.
[00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:54.960]   And I feel like we should all do wingman calls every day.
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:58.160]   He's like, it's just been so good for him just to get that daily.
[00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:00.300]   And it's like, there's like three questions, right?
[00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:01.160]   For every wingman call.
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:04.860]   It's like, what did you learn about God and something?
[00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:05.740]   And what are you going to do about it?
[00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:07.080]   Or what was the second question?
[00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:07.580]   Yeah.
[00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:10.700]   Honestly, off the top of my head, I went, I probably pull it up for you, but it's pretty
[00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:13.560]   much like, Hey, what is like, what did you learn from him?
[00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:14.460]   What are you going to do about it?
[00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:14.940]   I'm not forgetting.
[00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:15.200]   Yeah.
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:15.920]   It's like every day.
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:19.080]   If like, and he said, it just forces you to come up with like some sort of application
[00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:22.580]   that like, here's what I'm going to, here's how I'm going to obey the word of God.
[00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:23.000]   So I don't know.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:23.820]   I just thought that was cool.
[00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:26.660]   Just like to get in that discipline and doing that every day.
[00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:27.200]   Yeah.
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:28.440]   Yeah.
[00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:32.060]   You just get, you're just getting in a lot of good reps in time, in terms of like engaging
[00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:33.960]   with the word of God.
[00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:35.320]   So yeah.
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:37.660]   I mean, there's a lot that I'm hearing from you, David, like about the Nobleman program.
[00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:39.360]   Again, I haven't been part of it, but I've been hearing about
[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:43.300]   it, but yeah, like the regularity of it, the, just doing it with people.
[00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:48.180]   Like it really is a community thing, kind of the high intensity that has been good, but
[00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:52.500]   and it's like, what else, what else separates this just from other like life group or discipleship
[00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:53.580]   stuff you've experienced?
[00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:55.040]   Like what, what makes Nobleman unique?
[00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:55.420]   You think?
[00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:56.700]   Yeah.
[00:33:56.780 --> 00:33:59.560]   So I think you mentioned it just kind of emphasize like the structure.
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:03.600]   I think where we're committed to the structure, maybe in terms of like, well, I haven't been
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:06.460]   in part of a discipleship group that ends at something like four week, right?
[00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:08.760]   Where you come together, you live together.
[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:10.320]   So let me talk about that a little bit.
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:14.220]   So you, so the whole point system, I think it really helps because it really challenged
[00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:16.240]   you to keep up and be consistent.
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:19.040]   And so you're trying not to like lose points as you go through.
[00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:23.060]   So you miss an assignment, you miss your verses or whatever, you're going to lose points.
[00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:24.320]   Now there's ways to make it up, right?
[00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:26.060]   But you're doing it as a group.
[00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:28.980]   So you really don't want to let down your, like your friends, like we're a cohort, we're
[00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:29.520]   doing it together.
[00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:32.560]   And we're all trying to get to this thing's called four week.
[00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:34.980]   And that experience was awesome in itself.
[00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:38.840]   You live together in a house, you go to school, you come back and then we have certain like
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:40.120]   activities that we do at night.
[00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:40.900]   Wow.
[00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:45.700]   You finally like wrap all of that up and it's kind of intense actually for a week, but it's
[00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:46.440]   like super fun.
[00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:49.320]   And in terms of like bonding that you finally experienced.
[00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:49.740]   Yeah.
[00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:52.800]   That I haven't seen anything that's better than that.
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:57.920]   Uh, but then you eventually make it to like commissioning now, maybe to kind of just tie
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:01.600]   to that is like, as you're going through, it's the brotherhood thing, right?
[00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:04.920]   Um, cause you start off, yeah, you're learning about what it means to be a God, but then you
[00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:05.880]   learn to depend on each other.
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:07.420]   Those wingman calls allow for that.
[00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:08.760]   It's like an opportunity for that.
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:13.400]   Now, not every call is going to be like super deep and whatnot, but because we're meeting
[00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:18.280]   so often and you're talking on the phone so often and the content sort of like allows
[00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:21.020]   you to bring that out, you start to share a little bit deeper.
[00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:26.300]   And so, uh, part of this content is about purity and I won't go into like too much details,
[00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:28.020]   but you know, all guys, we know what we struggle with.
[00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:32.640]   And, uh, I think in that moment, it was such a shocking to me because I haven't seen this
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:36.200]   at any other life group was like, Hey, you know, let's talk about our struggles with purity.
[00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:38.000]   And then like it comes up.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.640]   And as we, we do that, like you start to forge and we realized, Hey, we can count on each
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:42.900]   other.
[00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:46.960]   And then, um, that, that just leads with them to just be much more closer.
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:52.120]   So these guys are super close and they, they really just for one another on.
[00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:56.900]   So I think that's one thing that I'd be really excited, uh, that I think kind of sets it apart.
[00:35:56.900 --> 00:36:01.600]   I'll say one memory from Fort Week that I just wanted to share just as like a mentor that
[00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:05.520]   really, it was around the word of God piece that we talked about because we get so much
[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:09.120]   of it and we memorize so much of it and it coming out at the right time.
[00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:10.420]   Uh, it's because we're storing it.
[00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:13.760]   And there was a situation for doing really hard activity.
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:17.100]   It was three or four weeks and everyone's getting angry at each other.
[00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:20.260]   Uh, cause there's one where you gotta, like, you gotta hold your weight.
[00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:24.840]   Like you gotta like hold, like there's something, anyway, I can't really go into it, but like
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:26.200]   you're doing something really hard.
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:31.100]   And if you don't all put in the effort, you know, um, like someone else is bearing the burden,
[00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:31.300]   right?
[00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:33.840]   So you get, people are getting frustrated and whatnot.
[00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:34.780]   I can sense it.
[00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:35.940]   We're halfway through this thing.
[00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:36.900]   We're nowhere near done.
[00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:39.060]   And I finally, I'm like, Hey guys, we need to stop.
[00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:43.600]   And I was like, guys, you know, we, we can't like, I know that we're upset right now.
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:45.980]   People are angry at each other, but we're not going to end like that.
[00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:46.820]   Right.
[00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:48.740]   And people start reciting verses.
[00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:50.060]   I mean, it was a weird experience.
[00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:51.280]   You know, it was like, Oh yeah.
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:55.580]   And actually it was the Philippians 2 verse, you know, from, and it's like, uh, you know,
[00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:58.020]   seeking that the interest of your own interest, but the interest of others.
[00:36:58.020 --> 00:36:58.320]   Right.
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:03.760]   Um, and then someone else recites a verse and then someone else recite, like, I didn't even
[00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:05.520]   know you guys remember any of this, right?
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:09.760]   Because like, you know, you guys don't know how to do this, but it starts to come out.
[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:11.900]   And it was just this picture that I was like, wow.
[00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:14.200]   Uh, this is what's God's done in their life.
[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:14.640]   That's wild.
[00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:18.080]   I don't think I've ever experienced that in like a decade of college ministry.
[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:19.280]   That's amazing.
[00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:22.300]   So that was, that was bursting out of people.
[00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:23.040]   I know.
[00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:24.960]   And it was like, okay, we're going to do this.
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:26.160]   And then we ended the night.
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:30.420]   It was, it was, I can't talk about the rest, but yeah, that was, I was like, wow.
[00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:30.960]   I know.
[00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:31.980]   I'm so curious.
[00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:35.880]   Well, I'm, I'm hearing like, I mean, I think I, in our ministry, there was a guy who ran
[00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:38.460]   a freedom fight for a group of guys in our church.
[00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:43.960]   It's like a 30 day and he ran their 30 day challenge and there were like daily calls, very
[00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:47.140]   similar, you know, because it's like a, you know, for those who don't know freedom fights,
[00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:52.160]   like a, yeah, another purity, you know, focused like group for guys and just like the power
[00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:52.920]   of habit, right?
[00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:57.500]   So we got the power of like memorization, the power of habit, the power of like these, and
[00:37:57.500 --> 00:37:59.640]   then these experiences where they have to live with each other.
[00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:01.920]   It's really like embodied all these things.
[00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:05.920]   It's not just content, not just information, but yeah, the sense of like needing each other.
[00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:06.320]   Yeah.
[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:07.800]   Embodied relationships, right?
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:08.700]   Face to face.
[00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:13.020]   And, and I think there is something that, that meets a need of this generation right now,
[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:15.080]   maybe even more so than, than in the past.
[00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:16.140]   So yeah.
[00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:17.800]   I love that.
[00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:25.940]   What do you think is, well, so, I mean, obviously in terms of like ministry recommendations, one
[00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:29.860]   recommendation would probably be just like do nobleman, but, um.
[00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:30.360]   Pretty cool.
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:35.140]   One day we had like a bunch of noblemans and like we had like a network gathering, like it
[00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:36.260]   just, it'd be awesome.
[00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:37.100]   Yeah.
[00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:38.480]   Just tossing off the charts.
[00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:38.640]   Yeah.
[00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:39.900]   We were totally thinking about that.
[00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:44.500]   We were saying like, dude, if we had like a network wide nobleman, like, I don't know,
[00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:45.100]   like ultra.
[00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:46.380]   Y'all had your own nicknames?
[00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:48.580]   Y'all had your nicknames like that you gave each other?
[00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:50.780]   You can get like a little badge or something, but yeah.
[00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:54.760]   But what do you, what do you think are some, any lessons from nobleman that like we can kind
[00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:58.100]   of extract out for the rest of our ministry and the rest of our network?
[00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:02.120]   I mean, other than just like, Hey, try nobleman, which I think everyone should do.
[00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:05.280]   It seems like I think I need to try it myself at some point, but yeah.
[00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:08.700]   What are some takeaways like for the rest of us that might implement in our ministries?
[00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:09.320]   Yeah.
[00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:10.300]   I would say, okay.
[00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:11.900]   Well, I'm going to say take a grain of salt.
[00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:14.680]   I'm just in terms of what of our, our experience was.
[00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:19.800]   I think typically whenever I bring up noblemen, I don't think everyone should do noblemen.
[00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:20.800]   Should I, should I say that?
[00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:21.240]   Is that okay?
[00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:21.940]   I can say that.
[00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:22.300]   Yeah.
[00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:22.560]   Yeah.
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:23.520]   Give us your honest opinion.
[00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:27.940]   I think you have to know your, your, but you got to have a really good reason not to do
[00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:28.140]   it.
[00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:31.020]   And there are a couple of reasons why you should do it.
[00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:37.260]   But the people will typically say, Oh, well, Hey David, I'm concerned about like, Oh, if
[00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:38.940]   a sub couple of people do it.
[00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:39.300]   Right.
[00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:43.620]   And like, what will that, like, how to, how about everyone else and what they feel, you
[00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:45.820]   know, how does that do for the group dynamic?
[00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:51.120]   Um, and just, you got to weigh the pros and cons of it.
[00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:51.300]   Right.
[00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:55.140]   Because in the case of like our case, when we did it, where we did pull out like a group
[00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:58.420]   of guys and it was looked at and like, Oh, that's the nobleman group.
[00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:00.760]   That's the group that is like super zealous.
[00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:01.060]   Right.
[00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:03.960]   Um, or they're doing something special over there.
[00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:05.780]   And they got like matching t-shirts and stuff.
[00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:07.040]   We had matching t-shirts.
[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:10.740]   No, uh, they have cooler looking t-shirts this time around.
[00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:12.840]   So for those ordering this time, I guess there's a black.
[00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:14.400]   Um, yeah.
[00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:17.520]   So, um, so like, what does that do to the group?
[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:20.740]   I think it's like, what, what, what do you want your group to be about?
[00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:21.660]   Right.
[00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:23.980]   And what's the goal for the group is what you want to think about.
[00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:30.160]   And for us, like we want, um, yeah, I guess our goal is that like students reaching students,
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:36.260]   uh, students like excited about the lost and reaching them.
[00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:42.520]   Um, and a lot of times, I guess we're trying to gather big group of people and we're trying
[00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:44.160]   to move them there at the same pace.
[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:45.660]   And that goes really slow.
[00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:48.700]   And it's very like almost sometimes it's like a painful experience.
[00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:52.360]   And, uh, in this case, yeah, that's kind of what it was like, you know, and we had a couple
[00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:55.080]   of people here, a lot of our, actually our upperclassmen had left.
[00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:56.860]   And so it was like almost a brand new group.
[00:40:56.860 --> 00:41:02.160]   And so we ended up doing this group, we pulling people out, but then what it did for our entire
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:06.820]   group is sort of like afterwards was the results I talked about last and earlier, which
[00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:11.220]   that like going into the fall, it kind of changed the dynamic of our entire group.
[00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:15.380]   people saw like, well, this is what's capable, like, like what's like, this is what's possible.
[00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:19.800]   There are other students that are challenging and kind of setting that bar for everyone else.
[00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:19.980]   Right.
[00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:21.640]   And so it sort of does that.
[00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:27.380]   And so I guess in my mind, um, I guess I'm, I'm a hard time articulating, I guess, because
[00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:32.760]   now as I'm talking, I don't even think I'm being that clear, but in my mind, yeah, I think
[00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:37.240]   it's just like, if the concern is about like, oh, Hey, we, we don't want to like, yeah,
[00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:39.000]   you know what I made people left out.
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:39.660]   Yeah.
[00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:43.320]   I mean, just, just to go off that a little bit, it makes me think of what Greg steer always
[00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:45.100]   says, which he says, go with the goers.
[00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:45.800]   Yeah.
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:52.400]   And if you can kind of get 10% of your group really on fire and zealous, like that changes
[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:56.400]   the rest of the group, it changes everything, but you can't, it's like really hard to change
[00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:58.100]   all like the entire group at once.
[00:41:58.100 --> 00:42:02.780]   So focus on that 10% and that'll really have kind of benefits for the rest of the group too.
[00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:05.920]   So, I mean, that, that, that's his, he's very big on that.
[00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:06.180]   Yeah.
[00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:10.760]   And, and, and just to add to that, like, don't be afraid to call them to something more, you
[00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:15.040]   know, don't, don't be afraid to ask the bar for those, you know, you can't do that for everyone,
[00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:18.940]   but, um, there are some students when you ask for more, they do respond.
[00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:22.600]   It's not gonna be everybody, but, and if you make that investment, like you said, right.
[00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:28.120]   I like that challenge, like to, to even tell that, that is a special challenge to the
[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:32.900]   nobleman that I can see you really believe in, you know, like you will, you will not
[00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:34.400]   come out of this semester unchanged.
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:36.100]   You're very confident in that.
[00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:36.300]   Right.
[00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:41.480]   But man, if we could almost like be able to talk about spiritual life and relationship
[00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:46.640]   with God in that way, just seem to more of our students, just like, if you want to see
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:51.340]   growth, if you want to see yourself grow closer to God, if you want to see like these things,
[00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:55.560]   it does require investment, you know, and, and I want to call you to that, you know, that,
[00:42:55.680 --> 00:43:02.260]   that kind of pitch or that kind of vision casting or, or whatever it might be motivation.
[00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:04.120]   I think that's, that's really valuable too.
[00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:04.520]   So.
[00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:05.500]   Yeah.
[00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:06.240]   Yeah.
[00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:08.980]   I guess what I was trying to say, it's okay that not everyone does it.
[00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:09.240]   Yeah.
[00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:10.060]   Okay.
[00:43:10.060 --> 00:43:12.900]   And that was, cause some people will say, well, I can't do it this month and that's okay.
[00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:15.620]   Well, we'll have to create another opportunity for you.
[00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:17.040]   There's always next semester.
[00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:17.700]   Yeah.
[00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:19.420]   And we don't have everyone do the same.
[00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:21.180]   So you're doing it, you're doing it this semester too?
[00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:22.580]   Doing it this semester, man.
[00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:23.440]   All right.
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:24.260]   Hey, yeah.
[00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:28.160]   So we just, I just came out of an interest meeting right into this call.
[00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:29.380]   No way.
[00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:34.360]   Where, where are any of like, do you, do you bring back the people who did noblemen and
[00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:35.860]   now they help lead it or it's that?
[00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:36.220]   Yeah.
[00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:36.980]   What happens after?
[00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:42.200]   There is a, so there's a role called lessers and that's sort of the student leader group.
[00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:46.140]   And so we have two guys who will be lessers for this semester.
[00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:46.660]   Yeah.
[00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:49.180]   And so this is our first time doing that.
[00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:49.780]   Lessers?
[00:43:49.780 --> 00:43:50.820]   Like lessers?
[00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:51.440]   Yeah.
[00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:54.660]   The terminology that NAVs wanted and to do.
[00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:57.440]   And I think it's, we'll super trade servant leadership.
[00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:58.260]   Okay.
[00:43:58.260 --> 00:44:02.880]   Leadership is not like a status, you know, it's influence.
[00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:03.180]   Right.
[00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:05.940]   And so like they could have that influence in this group.
[00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:07.700]   And so they will be like the student leaders.
[00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:11.340]   So are they doing like what you did last time?
[00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:13.020]   Now they're in that role or is it a little different?
[00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:17.080]   Maybe less of the logistics stuff for them, but they will be running a lot of the sessions.
[00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:17.900]   Wow.
[00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:18.420]   It's cool.
[00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:19.860]   That's neat.
[00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:20.380]   It's really neat.
[00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:20.920]   That's neat.
[00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:22.840]   Well, man, I, that's it for me.
[00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:25.040]   I was like, do you have, do you have more questions or anything like that?
[00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:25.200]   No.
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:25.600]   Oh man.
[00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:28.940]   Antoine never, he told me he would be back on 10 minutes, about 20 minutes ago.
[00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:30.420]   So his phone died.
[00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:31.200]   So I don't know.
[00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:31.720]   Yeah.
[00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:35.720]   The charger broke, but maybe we can get him on another time and hear some of his thoughts.
[00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:37.580]   But yeah, I think that's all the questions I had.
[00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:39.540]   Actually, here we go.
[00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:41.000]   Who's back?
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:41.880]   Antoine!
[00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:43.120]   Are you there?
[00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:43.880]   Yay.
[00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:45.860]   Just in time for the closing.
[00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:49.160]   We can hear you.
[00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:50.040]   We can hear you.
[00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:51.580]   We can't see you, but we can hear you.
[00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:52.680]   That's okay.
[00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:54.520]   I'll turn my camera on soon in a second.
[00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:55.240]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:55.760]   No worries.
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:45:00.060]   We were just about to wrap up, Antoine, but maybe I could, I could ask you this too.
[00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:06.040]   So I just asked David this, but like, what are some takeaways from Nobleman that we might
[00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:08.500]   be able to apply to like the rest of our network?
[00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:11.560]   Like some, like, man, this is something they do really well.
[00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:15.560]   Or here's like how I think we can maybe adopt some of this into college ministry.
[00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:18.420]   And I know a lot of it is like, you got to trust the system and you got to do the whole
[00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:18.820]   program.
[00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:19.820]   But like, yeah.
[00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:21.360]   Short of like, just do Nobleman.
[00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:23.220]   Like what, what are some takeaways that you think?
[00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:26.280]   Some takeaways from Nobleman.
[00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:32.180]   I'm going to say that, you know, a lot of the guys, you might think or assume that they
[00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:37.940]   might not be willing to do something hard, challenging, something that's costly that they
[00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:40.940]   have to, you know, even fork over money for.
[00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:49.880]   But it seems like as long as the content is there, the camaraderie and the ability to kind
[00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:54.760]   of meet the need that they really feel deep inside these young men, I really think that
[00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:55.680]   they'll be willing to do it.
[00:45:55.780 --> 00:46:03.140]   So it made me a lot more courageous in my ask and my expectation of how people will respond
[00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:04.940]   when given such an invitation.
[00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:06.640]   It's good.
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:09.900]   It's that, um, it's that right mix of challenge and invitation.
[00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:10.740]   Yeah.
[00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:11.880]   Go ahead, put it.
[00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:12.140]   Yeah.
[00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:13.400]   Oh, man.
[00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:14.480]   Thank you guys so much.
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:18.380]   As always, we could have heard more of your thoughts, but, but again, I think, uh, I think
[00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:22.340]   you, you, you'll, you'll just have to watch this and comment on the video or something
[00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:22.640]   later.
[00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:23.700]   Like David missed this.
[00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:24.880]   You can make a video response.
[00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:25.140]   Yeah.
[00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:25.360]   Yeah.
[00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:29.820]   Here's my response to that podcast I was on, but, um, thank you guys.
[00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:35.060]   Uh, I know that there are other, uh, nobleman groups, um, still going, uh, or starting up
[00:46:35.060 --> 00:46:36.540]   this, this quarter seems like it is.
[00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:38.160]   Antoine's doing it again.
[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:39.900]   There's, I think OSU is doing it.
[00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:41.540]   Uh, we're, we're thinking about it here in Philly.
[00:46:41.540 --> 00:46:43.480]   Like I'm like, I'm like, who's supposed to point the trigger?
[00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:46.600]   Oh, I think it's, it's going to catch on.
[00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:49.360]   And hopefully when more people hear about this, it'll catch on.
[00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:53.960]   I know that there are sisters asking, is there a sisters version of this?
[00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:55.540]   And, and I know that they've been trying to develop it.
[00:46:55.540 --> 00:46:57.980]   And so we're really looking forward to that.
[00:46:57.980 --> 00:46:58.720]   Yeah.
[00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:02.800]   They're still in the, the iterating testing phase of that, but they are working on it apparently.
[00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:06.460]   So it's coming and hopefully it'll be just as awesome, you know, so that more people can
[00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:11.380]   experience growing closer in community, going closer to God, going closer to, and just, just
[00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:12.120]   growing in their, yeah.
[00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:13.920]   Just character and all of that.
[00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:15.220]   So, all right.
[00:47:15.220 --> 00:47:18.580]   I kind of feel like I should pray at the end, but I think we should just sign off.
[00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:20.120]   But should we pray?
[00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:21.620]   Let me just pray for all the broken men.
[00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:21.740]   Yeah.
[00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:22.340]   Pray us out.
[00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:22.960]   Yeah.
[00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:23.560]   I'll pray us out.
[00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:24.060]   I'll pray us out.
[00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:25.200]   God, we just lift you.
[00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:29.480]   All the nobleman groups are going on and all the guys in our network, God, all the guys,
[00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:35.140]   especially those in college and God, we know, I mean, yeah, just the kinds of challenges
[00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:42.800]   Lord, that the guys face and just the lostness, the sense of purposelessness and even just an
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:45.400]   assault on like masculinity in itself, Lord.
[00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:48.340]   And, and God, you, you created us.
[00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:49.400]   You created us good.
[00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:50.760]   You created us with purpose.
[00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:54.880]   You created us with a certain design and you, you created us to be blessings.
[00:47:54.880 --> 00:48:00.100]   And, and I just pray that the guys specifically, I know that the girls need this prayer too,
[00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:04.040]   but the guys would, would hear this, that, that your heart for them is good.
[00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:11.000]   And in Christ, they can become new creations and they can genuinely experience the blessing
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:15.860]   of being a new creation in Christ, like in this life and, and make a significant impact
[00:48:15.860 --> 00:48:17.100]   on the people around them.
[00:48:17.100 --> 00:48:21.900]   And I just pray that that, as David shared, that would just, just raise the tide, Lord
[00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:24.860]   of zeal and Christ likeness in all of our groups.
[00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:30.080]   And yeah, we just pray that whether that comes to noblemen or other means, he would just be
[00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:32.900]   able to use that in, in show watching world.
[00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:36.100]   Like this is what it looks like when we follow Jesus.
[00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:38.120]   This is what masculinity looks like.
[00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:40.420]   This is what brotherhood looks like when we follow Jesus.
[00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:43.480]   And it would be such a powerful testimony to the power of the gospel.
[00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:45.160]   So thank you, pray all in Jesus name.
[00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:45.720]   Amen.
[00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:46.100]   Amen.
[00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:46.680]   Amen.
[00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:50.020]   Thanks for jumping on with us guys.
