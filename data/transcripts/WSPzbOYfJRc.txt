[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.320]   I should like to call your attention once more to the great sentence written by the
[00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:11.540]   Apostle Paul to the Ephesians, which is to be found in the third chapter of the epistle
[00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.320]   to the Ephesians, from verse 2 to verse 7.
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.000]   If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you, O Lord,
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.760]   how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery, as I wrote afore in few words,
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:35.280]   whereby when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge and the mystery of Christ, which
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.500]   in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his
[00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:49.000]   holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit, that the Gentiles should be fellow heirs,
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.800]   and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ Jesus by the gospel, whereof
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:03.280]   I was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.280]   working of his power.
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.080]   Well, there is a great sentence, and we began to consider it last Sunday morning.
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:18.200]   You remember that the Apostle here is concerned to enable these Ephesians to have an understanding
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:25.840]   of the greatness of his calling, in order that having understood that, they no longer
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:33.560]   will be faint in their hearts and in their minds as they think of him in prison.
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.560]   That was his object.
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.240]   It is purely a pastoral object primarily.
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.080]   He knew that they were worrying about him, and he knows that the only way to get them
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:48.840]   out of that is so to enable them to look at the glory of his ministry, the privilege of
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.800]   it all, and to see it so clearly that instead of being worried about him, they would thank
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.840]   him for his wonderful grace.
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.360]   Now we are interested in all this not simply because it is a part of the exposition of
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:09.720]   this great epistle, but because it indeed has a very important practical relevance for
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.720]   us.
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.080]   We are living in a world in which there are many Christian people this morning suffering
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.480]   acutely because they are Christians.
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.840]   The faith of some of them may be shaken.
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.200]   Our faith may be shaken because of what they are having to endure.
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.320]   God knows a day may come when we as Christians may have to endure in this land.
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.160]   Well, now this is the way to be prepared for that kind of thing.
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:42.200]   But even if that were not necessary, and for that reason, what can be more important than
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.280]   that we should contemplate the greatness of this plan of salvation?
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:55.360]   It is only as we grasp it that we shall praise God as we ought and worship him as we were
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.640]   meant to do.
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.320]   So we come back to it.
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:04.040]   Now the apostle, I say, is just trying to give them a glimpse of this extraordinary
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.720]   way in which God has contrived to bring the gospel to them.
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.400]   Here they are as Christians who had been so different.
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.080]   How have they ever come to be Christians?
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.520]   Well, it is because of what God has done, and what he has done in particular to this
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.960]   particular man, his servant, the apostle Paul.
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.880]   And the apostle goes back over it again.
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.080]   He seems to say, "In effect, I had the great privilege of preaching the gospel to you in
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.080]   Ephesus.
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.680]   You had never heard of it until I came amongst you.
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.960]   But do you realize what a wonderful thing it is that I, of everybody, should ever have
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.880]   preached that gospel unto you?
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.000]   Do you remember what I once was?
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.040]   What is it that ever made me a preacher?"
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.840]   And back he goes over the great account.
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.760]   He says, as we saw last Sunday morning, that he is an apostle.
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.520]   He is an apostle of equal rank and standing with all those others, though he was never
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.320]   with the Lord in the days of his flesh as they were.
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.640]   Though he hadn't received his commission from the Lord while he was yet on earth, as
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:12.600]   the other apostles had, but had that special revelation on the road to Damascus, saw the
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:18.160]   Lord of glory actually risen from the dead and received his commission directly from
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.000]   him there, face to face.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.600]   He is an apostle of equal rank with all those others, and he glories in it.
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.640]   And you remember how he tells them something of what that means.
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:39.480]   It means that the mystery had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit in exactly the same
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:45.960]   way as it had been to the other apostles and to the prophets.
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.680]   And having looked at all that, we drew certain important lessons for ourselves, lessons which
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:56.060]   are of vital concern to every Christian, to every member of the Christian church at this
[00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.960]   present hour.
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.840]   Because it may well be that every one of you will have to come to a decision one day as
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:08.920]   to whether you are going to be members of a great church, great world organization,
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:14.360]   which believes in apostolic succession and that the Pope of Rome is the vicar of Christ
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.000]   in a unique sense.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.240]   These are some of the problems that we'll have to confront us all.
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.560]   And here these things are dealt with by the apostle.
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.520]   But now let us press on.
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:34.160]   Here he is, I say he's an apostle, and that means that this mystery has been revealed
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.080]   to him by the Holy Spirit.
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.880]   He wouldn't have known it otherwise.
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:44.200]   No one can know it otherwise, but it had been given to him in this special way, this dispensation
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:50.000]   of the grace of God, this stewardship, this thing that had been committed to his charge
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   and to his care.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.960]   He's got to look after it, he's got to protect it against thieves and robbers and
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.960]   those who would detract from it.
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.760]   All that is a part of his ministry.
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.640]   Well now then the question that arises is this.
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:07.360]   What is this mystery that has been revealed to him?
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.720]   And he gives us the answer himself.
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:16.320]   Now you notice that in this long sentence he uses the word mystery twice.
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.760]   It's in verse 3 and in verse 4.
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:25.240]   How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery.
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:30.240]   Then in the authorized version, bracket.
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:34.560]   Now unfortunately the revised version and the revised standard and others don't use
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:39.320]   these brackets and it's a great pity because it confuses the issue.
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:45.400]   The authorized, very rightly I say now, starts with a parenthesis in brackets.
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:50.840]   As I wrote afore in few words, whereby, that is to say when you look back at that when
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:57.480]   ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ.
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.040]   End of the brackets.
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:04.800]   Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men.
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.780]   Now the brackets I say are important for this reason.
[00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:16.600]   That the statement within the brackets is very definitely a parenthesis.
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.960]   So that really you can read it like this if you like.
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:23.980]   How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery.
[00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:25.520]   Then go on to verse 5.
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:30.840]   Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed unto
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:35.640]   his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit that the Gentiles should be fellow heirs and
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:36.640]   of the same body.
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.840]   That's the statement.
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:43.040]   But then he's put in this subsidiary statement.
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:49.000]   As I wrote afore in a few words, there he's referring to what he's already said in chapters
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.240]   1 and 2.
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:55.320]   Not referring to another epistle, but to what he's already said, what I said above we would
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:56.960]   say now.
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:59.080]   He said it in chapters 1 and 2.
[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:05.660]   As I wrote afore in a few words, whereby when you read, go back and read it again he says.
[00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:09.160]   And you notice how we should read an epistle?
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.000]   Shouldn't be in too much of a hurry to get to the end.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.700]   Go back and read what he's already said.
[00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:15.400]   And he's telling them to do that.
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:16.760]   He said have you got it clearly?
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.400]   Well go back and read it again.
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.340]   Read chapters 1 and 2 once more at this point.
[00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:31.380]   And if you do that you'll understand when you read my knowledge in the mystery of Christ.
[00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:36.780]   Now then, it's quite clear, isn't it, that he's using the word mystery about two different
[00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:38.640]   things.
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:42.820]   You remember our definition last Sunday morning of the word mystery.
[00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:48.660]   It means something that the human mind can entertain unto by its own unaided effort.
[00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:52.500]   It's something that must be revealed by the Holy Spirit.
[00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:57.660]   It doesn't mean something which is misty or uncertain and about which you can never be
[00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:59.180]   clear in your minds.
[00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:00.660]   Not that at all.
[00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:06.660]   It means something that without this enlightenment and revelation we really can never grasp.
[00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:07.660]   Right.
[00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:13.260]   Well now then, he's using it I say in two senses.
[00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:17.240]   And we can describe the senses like this.
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:26.260]   The mystery that he talks about in the parenthesis, especially in verse 4, is the mystery of Christ.
[00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.620]   Let's call that the general mystery.
[00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:34.540]   But then the thing he's really concerned to elaborate is another mystery.
[00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:37.960]   The mystery that he elaborates in verses 5 and 6.
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:42.860]   This mystery which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now unto
[00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:46.820]   his holy apostles and prophets that the Gentiles should be fellow heirs.
[00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:50.420]   That is the particular mystery.
[00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:57.380]   Now that bit of exposition of course was essential because if we are not clear about this we
[00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:02.940]   shall probably be muddled and confused about his entire statement.
[00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:09.480]   Now again it is interesting to notice not only the working of the mind of this great
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:13.340]   apostle but to watch his spirit.
[00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:20.060]   You see there are certain things the apostle evidently cannot refrain from doing.
[00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:25.340]   Though he plays havoc with his style as we indicated a fortnight ago, he seems to be
[00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:28.260]   quite incapable of controlling himself.
[00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:32.900]   Now though he is setting out to talk about the particular mystery here, he can't pass
[00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:37.340]   by without saying just a word about the general mystery.
[00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:42.620]   And therefore we start now with the general mystery.
[00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:50.980]   This mystery which he refers to in verse 4 and which he describes as the mystery of
[00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:51.980]   Christ.
[00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:56.900]   Now what does he mean by this?
[00:10:56.900 --> 00:11:04.820]   Well he is referring I say to what he has already been expounding to these Ephesians.
[00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:11.220]   You need be in no doubt in no uncertainty he seems to say as to my knowledge of this
[00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:13.620]   message that has been committed unto me.
[00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:18.620]   Later on he is going to call himself a minister who has been appointed to preach it.
[00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:20.140]   He says I think I have said enough.
[00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:25.420]   I have written enough for you to know already that he gave me an insight into it.
[00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:30.940]   I have a knowledge in this mystery of Christ.
[00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.300]   Now what is this?
[00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:37.660]   What does he mean by the mystery of Christ?
[00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:45.700]   Well of course this is just another way of referring to the whole message of the gospel.
[00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:52.780]   Or if you prefer it, it is just a way of referring to the Lord Jesus Christ himself.
[00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:58.340]   For he in reality is the gospel.
[00:11:58.340 --> 00:11:59.980]   It is all in him.
[00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:04.740]   The apostle you see is talking about the message committed unto him, the message that he preached
[00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:05.860]   to these people.
[00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:07.780]   What is the message?
[00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:14.220]   It is Christ, the mystery of Christ.
[00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:20.300]   Now if you cannot read the writings of this great apostle without seeing that this is
[00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:27.180]   the thing he is always talking about, go through the epistles of Paul and just put down on
[00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:36.500]   paper every time he refers to him as Christ or the Lord Jesus Christ or Christ Jesus my
[00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:38.500]   Lord and so on.
[00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:43.020]   It is perfectly astounding and amazing.
[00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:46.780]   Someone once put it he is a Christ intoxicated man.
[00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:53.340]   It is not surprising that he says to me to live is Christ.
[00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:57.380]   Everything ends, centre, soul, everything.
[00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:58.380]   Well why?
[00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:06.100]   Well because his whole message was this, that everything that God has for man is in Christ
[00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:08.500]   and nowhere else.
[00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:13.580]   He puts it for instance in writing to the Colossians, in Colossians 2, 3, in these words,
[00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:19.180]   in whom he says, "Are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge."
[00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:26.700]   It is all there in Christ and it is nowhere else.
[00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:32.180]   So you see he cannot pass on to his particular mystery without just saying a word once more
[00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:35.940]   about this great general mystery.
[00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:44.380]   Now listen to him again saying the same thing in writing his first epistle to Timothy.
[00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:48.100]   And without controversy he says.
[00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:52.540]   And you remember don't you that this is a pastoral epistle, a very practical epistle.
[00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:58.500]   He is really writing to Timothy to tell him all about ordaining presbyters and deacons
[00:13:58.500 --> 00:13:59.500]   and things like that.
[00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:05.100]   It is one of the most practical passages in all his writings but you see again he cannot
[00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:06.100]   help himself.
[00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:10.420]   He says, "I want you to know how to behave yourself in the house of God which is the
[00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:16.060]   church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth."
[00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:22.820]   And without controversy, "Great is the mystery of godliness.
[00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:31.420]   God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the spirit, seen of angels, preached unto
[00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:38.420]   the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.
[00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:43.300]   Great is the mystery of godliness."
[00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:44.300]   He is bound to say it.
[00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:46.140]   He cannot help saying it.
[00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:47.140]   Why?
[00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:51.620]   Well of course this is the most thrilling and the most exciting, the most tremendous
[00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:54.780]   thing that has ever come into the world, will ever come.
[00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:57.420]   There is nothing beyond it.
[00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:02.700]   And therefore the apostle of necessity must pause and look at it and say something about
[00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:03.700]   it.
[00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:05.700]   Well what is it?
[00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:09.820]   Well I say it is just this.
[00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:16.420]   It is this amazing way in which God has sent salvation to men.
[00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:19.900]   It is the way that he has done it.
[00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:23.300]   It is the plan.
[00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:25.900]   This astounding thing.
[00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:34.900]   All this that has happened in and through the Lord Jesus Christ, the mystery.
[00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:37.340]   And what a mystery.
[00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:38.420]   Who would ever have seen it?
[00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:40.300]   Who would ever have known it?
[00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:46.860]   Were it not for the illumination, for the revelation that the Holy Ghost alone can give?
[00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:49.860]   Let me put it to you like this.
[00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:53.660]   A babe is born in Bethlehem and put in a manger.
[00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:54.660]   Well that is all right.
[00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:56.900]   That happens very frequently.
[00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:57.900]   A babe.
[00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:01.020]   Is there anything marvelous about that?
[00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:05.980]   And that is the greatest mystery of all.
[00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:11.420]   For that child, that babe is the eternal Son of God.
[00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:16.220]   The mystery.
[00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:21.940]   Two natures in one person.
[00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:22.940]   He is God.
[00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:23.940]   He is man.
[00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:27.380]   He is truly God without any limitation.
[00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:32.820]   He is truly man without any limitation.
[00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:35.720]   And those two natures are in him.
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:37.300]   And yet he is not two persons.
[00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:40.900]   He is only one person.
[00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:42.620]   I don't understand that, says someone.
[00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:43.620]   Of course you don't.
[00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:47.020]   You are not meant to.
[00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:50.500]   If you think your mind is big enough to grasp and to span a thing like that, you had better
[00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:54.660]   think again.
[00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:58.140]   That is the mystery of godliness.
[00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:03.620]   And this man who probably had a deeper insight into it than anybody who has ever lived, he
[00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:12.260]   himself simply stands back and says, "Great is the mystery of godliness."
[00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.300]   It's been revealed.
[00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:17.100]   He knows that there are the two natures in the one person.
[00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:23.020]   He knows now who that is, not by any process of his own, but by the revelation, as he tells
[00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:27.980]   us, through the Holy Spirit, what the Son himself said to him when he said in reply
[00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:30.820]   to Saul's question, "Who art thou, Lord?
[00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:33.340]   I am Jesus whom thou persecust."
[00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:38.820]   There it is.
[00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:42.460]   The mystery of Christ.
[00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:49.620]   This is God's way of salvation, that almighty and eternal and everlasting God to whom the
[00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:57.700]   nations are but as the small dust of the balance and vanity and less than that and lighter
[00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:02.620]   than vanity, the God who made everything out of nothing, who simply said, "Let there
[00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:04.780]   be light," and there was light.
[00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:10.660]   Well, you would have thought that when he desired to save men and to save the world,
[00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:18.100]   again he would utter some great word and the whole universe would shake and quake and there
[00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:24.780]   would be some dramatic exhibition of power, and so God would say, "Be disloyal and save
[00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:25.780]   men."
[00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:30.380]   But he didn't do it like that.
[00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:31.380]   How has he done it?
[00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:40.060]   Well, he has done it in this mystery of Christ, in a helpless babe, nothing weaker, nothing
[00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:46.100]   more helpless, nothing smaller, nothing more defenseless.
[00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:49.660]   There it is.
[00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:55.860]   And then everything that happened in him, the whole process of the incarnation.
[00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:59.700]   Do you spend your time thinking about it?
[00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:10.540]   Divesting himself of the insignia of his eternal glory and coming there through that, the mystery.
[00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:15.660]   And all his humiliation and all that he endured and suffered, we won't go through it this
[00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:16.660]   morning.
[00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:17.660]   There it is.
[00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:22.420]   The apostle has been referring to it, and then the death, the burial, the resurrection,
[00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:25.820]   the ascension.
[00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:29.140]   And that's God's way of salvation.
[00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:34.980]   That's God's way of dealing with the human predicament, the human problem.
[00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:42.260]   That's God's way of reconciling men unto himself and of ultimately producing glorious
[00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:46.140]   order and glory out of the chaos of things as they are.
[00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:48.140]   Now that's it.
[00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:53.140]   That's the thing he's talking about.
[00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:58.180]   If you read again what I've said, says the apostle, in a few words, when you read, you
[00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:09.860]   may understand my knowledge, my insight into, my grasp of the mystery of Christ.
[00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:15.260]   Let me leave this with just a question.
[00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:22.060]   Is the mystery of Christ the most absorbing interest in your life?
[00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:29.140]   Is the mystery of Christ to you the most thrilling thing in the world this morning?
[00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:34.620]   Is this, I say, the center of your life, the thing that's uppermost in your heart, the
[00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:37.420]   core of your meditation ever?
[00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:43.380]   Oh, if you go through these scriptures, you'll find that he is there always in that central
[00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:44.380]   position.
[00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:47.740]   Read your hymn book, go right through it, and you'll find that they're always looking
[00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:53.340]   at him and contemplating him and standing back and forth with Paul, expressing amazement
[00:20:53.340 --> 00:21:02.060]   at the mystery, the mystery of Christ.
[00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:05.640]   It's the last thing the Jews ever thought of.
[00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:10.540]   It's the last thing that Saul of Tarsus had ever thought of or ever even imagined, but
[00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:11.540]   it's the fact.
[00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:12.540]   It is the gospel.
[00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:18.420]   It is the thing that Christ gave to him there on the road to Damascus and said, "Go and
[00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:23.100]   preach it to the people, the Jews, and to the Gentiles to whom I shall send thee."
[00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:24.100]   There it is.
[00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:27.180]   I am the resurrection and the life.
[00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:32.780]   In me remission of sins is to be preached unto all nations, as he said himself after
[00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:41.300]   his resurrection to the assembled apostles.
[00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:46.740]   I do trust that we are now not quite as surprised as we may have been why Paul has to use brackets
[00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:53.740]   and throw in his parentheses and forget style.
[00:21:53.740 --> 00:22:02.460]   As I think I said before, if I may use the apostolic terms, the whole tragedy of the
[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:07.780]   church today is that we no longer have parentheses.
[00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:08.780]   We are much too perfect.
[00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:13.300]   Our literary form is much too fine.
[00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:18.700]   These beautiful essays that are lifeless, they achieve nothing, how can they?
[00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:20.300]   We are much too controlled.
[00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:23.220]   It's because we haven't seen the mystery.
[00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:24.460]   There are no loose ends.
[00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:25.460]   Why?
[00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:28.580]   Well, because there's nothing to take us off the tangents as we just think of him or
[00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:33.540]   his name is mentioned, and we are lost.
[00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:41.140]   Thank God for the brackets and the parentheses, which remind us again of the mystery of Christ.
[00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:43.020]   Well, go on.
[00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:45.860]   We must go on to his particular mystery.
[00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:50.380]   The particular mystery, I say, is the thing that he started talking about in verse 3,
[00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:52.740]   but which he doesn't take up until verse 5.
[00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:58.100]   How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery, which in other ages was not
[00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:02.860]   made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets
[00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:09.980]   by the Spirit, that the Gentiles should be fellow-heirs and of the same body, and partakers
[00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:14.620]   of his promise in Christ by the gospel.
[00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:17.180]   Now then, we must look at this.
[00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:27.380]   Here he is dealing with this particular matter of the relationship of the Jew and the Gentile
[00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:29.900]   in the Christian church.
[00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:34.180]   Now the apostle tells us elsewhere that he glories in the effect that he is particularly
[00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:40.100]   the apostle to the Gentiles, and he glories, he tells us in his office, he is very concerned
[00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:44.480]   about it at this point, because of course he is writing to these Ephesians who have
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:49.660]   been Gentiles and pagans, and his whole objective, as I've said, is to enable them to realize
[00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:55.860]   the marvel and the wonder of it all.
[00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:59.940]   But you know, my friends, you and I have got an additional reason for being careful
[00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:05.420]   about this particular statement.
[00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:10.380]   And let me say, quite frankly, that I would sooner in every way not have to deal with
[00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:11.380]   this.
[00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:17.940]   But as I understand the business of preaching, it is not only to exhort, and not only to
[00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:20.860]   comfort but to instruct.
[00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:26.020]   It is only as our doctrine is fairly straight in our minds that we can truly live the Christian
[00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:30.820]   life and enjoy it as we are meant to do.
[00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:36.340]   And as I preach, I know, therefore, that there are those who use certain Bibles and certain
[00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:45.380]   books, and I know that they read their notes, which lay tremendous stress upon this particular
[00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:51.940]   statement, and out of it construct a whole outlook and a scheme of teaching.
[00:24:51.940 --> 00:25:00.300]   I am referring to what is commonly known by the name of dispensationalism, and I am obviously
[00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:06.380]   referring in passing to the notes which are found in the so-called Schofield Bible.
[00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:11.420]   I know there are many present who undoubtedly use it, and I know that there is always a
[00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:17.020]   danger when you find notes in a Bible to believe unconsciously that the notes are as inspired
[00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:18.700]   as the text.
[00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:22.860]   We tend to swallow it all, we tend to take it as authentic, and it can be presented in
[00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:28.100]   such a way that sometimes it seems most plausible and nothing can be said against it.
[00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:33.340]   But very well, therefore, we are driven much against our will just to glance at this from
[00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:37.300]   that particular standpoint.
[00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:40.340]   You are familiar with this dispensational teaching.
[00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:47.780]   It roughly says something like this, that all the promises which you find in the Old
[00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:56.860]   Testament were made to the Jews and apply only to the Jews, that they do not apply to
[00:25:56.860 --> 00:26:04.340]   the Church, that the Christian Church is something which has come in—this is their term—as
[00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:09.940]   a kind of parenthesis, that when the Lord Jesus Christ came into this world, he came
[00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:17.340]   to offer the kingdom to the Jews, and it was only because they refused it that he brought
[00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:19.100]   in the idea of the Church.
[00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:22.900]   If only the Jews had accepted the kingdom, they say there would never have been a Christian
[00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:24.260]   Church at all.
[00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:29.780]   But the Jews, having rejected the kingdom, the Church has come in as a new dispensation,
[00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:34.460]   as a kind of parenthesis, it will come to an end, and then again you will go back to
[00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:39.340]   the Jews and the promises to the Jews as a particular nation will all come into being
[00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:43.100]   and into force, and Christ will again set up his kingdom.
[00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:48.180]   They draw a sharp line of division between the Church and the kingdom.
[00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:52.980]   They say the Jews are still a separate and a special people, and that all these Old Testament
[00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:55.860]   prophecies only apply to them.
[00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:59.860]   Now you see the relevance of this.
[00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:03.840]   The people who believe that sort of thing are very busy at the present time in preaching
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:10.060]   sermons and delivering addresses about Egypt and about what's happening in Palestine and
[00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:11.060]   in the Near East.
[00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:14.200]   They say, "Here it is, this is the very scripture."
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:17.820]   So they're preaching that at the present time, Egypt in the scriptures, what's going
[00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:18.820]   to happen?
[00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:22.300]   And some of them even claim they can tell you exactly what's going to happen.
[00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:24.960]   They find it all, they say, in the scriptures.
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:30.620]   Now then, they make great use of this particular statement that we are examining now, and they
[00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:32.820]   do so for this reason.
[00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:39.660]   Listen to what the apostle says, "How that by revelation I made known unto you the mystery,
[00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:49.020]   which in other ages was not known unto the sons of men."
[00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:53.140]   And there they stop.
[00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:55.260]   And you see, they argue like this.
[00:27:55.260 --> 00:28:03.180]   They say, "Surely that is a perfectly clear statement," to the effect that this is something
[00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:07.040]   that was not known under the old dispensation.
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:12.720]   Something which was not known, indeed they go on to say, until it was revealed to the
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:14.960]   apostle Paul.
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:19.120]   That is their teaching, that this doctrine concerning the church was revealed only to
[00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:20.120]   the apostle Paul.
[00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:24.760]   And here he says it was revealed to him, and to nobody else.
[00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:30.360]   So he is the one alone to whom this revelation of this particular mystery was made.
[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:33.960]   There are some indeed who are even foolish enough to say that there is nothing in the
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:38.440]   Old Testament about the fact that the Gentiles were going to be saved.
[00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:43.840]   Well, there's only one answer to give to that, and that is go and read the Old Testament.
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:46.280]   And you'll find it there in many, many places.
[00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:51.280]   The promise was made to Abram, as Paul reminded us in that third chapter of Galatians, "In
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:55.000]   thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed."
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.120]   Thank God it's there in many other places.
[00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:03.200]   In Isaiah you get it constantly, "The Ahils and the Gentiles," and so on.
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:05.120]   It's there.
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:08.160]   And that is the simple answer.
[00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:13.440]   But I say there are others, and these are the most important, because this is the particular
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:20.000]   teaching of the Schofield Bible, for instance, who say that it was that the Church as such
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.440]   was not known under the Old Dispensation.
[00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:26.560]   Now this is an exact quotation from that book.
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:33.000]   The Church corporately is not in the vision of the Old Testament prophets.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:39.200]   And then in brackets, to prove that contention, Ephesians 3, 1-6.
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:46.240]   Ephesians 3, 1-6 says that statement indicates that the Church corporately is not in the
[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:48.200]   vision of the Old Testament prophet.
[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:50.480]   If you're interested in that, you'll find that.
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:55.440]   You'll find it in the introduction to the prophetic books of the Old Testament in those
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:58.000]   particular notes.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:03.040]   Well now then, what are we to say to this?
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:09.160]   I perhaps might add, in order to make my statement complete before I come to my answer, that
[00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:15.720]   there is a system of ultra-dispensationalism, not the one which you find in those notes,
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:21.200]   but the one associated with the name of Dr. Bullinger, ultra-dispensationalism, which
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:28.600]   really goes as far as to say this, that it is only here that you really get the New Testament
[00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:30.840]   gospel which applies to us.
[00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:32.440]   That was what he taught.
[00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:36.720]   He said the gospels have nothing to do with us at all, they were for the Jews only.
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:43.680]   Here, they say, is the message for this age, for Jews and Gentiles, in the Church.
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:45.280]   He even went as far as that.
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:50.320]   Well, we're not concerned about the particularities, but let us take this general question.
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:52.320]   What is the answer to this?
[00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:58.200]   Well, surely, the doctrine concerning the Church was clearly taught by our Lord and
[00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:01.140]   Savior Jesus Christ himself.
[00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:06.400]   Take the great scene at Caesarea Philippi, when he said to Peter, "Upon this rock I
[00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:11.000]   will found and establish my church."
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   Now let's be fair.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.080]   The Schofield notes have to admit that he did that.
[00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:19.320]   They don't make much use of it, but they're in honesty have got to admit it.
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:21.240]   They say he didn't do it very clearly.
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:23.880]   All right, but the fact is that he did it.
[00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:25.640]   It isn't only revealed to Paul.
[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:27.720]   It had been revealed at Ennui before.
[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:30.120]   Our Lord himself taught it.
[00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:37.000]   But indeed, going back, we find this, that it was what Peter preached on the day of Pentecost.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.440]   When the question came up, saying, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?"
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:49.480]   Peter's reply was, "Repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:56.080]   ye shall receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost, for the promise is unto you and to your children
[00:31:56.080 --> 00:32:01.000]   and to as many as are far off."
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.120]   That's the Gentiles.
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:09.120]   And of course, he and John obviously recognized this principle when going down to Samaria,
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:11.360]   as you read the account in Acts 8.
[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:17.080]   They recognized that those Samaritans who were not Jews had also come in and had received
[00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:21.320]   the benefits of salvation, and they laid their hands upon them, and they received the Holy
[00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:22.320]   Ghost.
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:27.760]   And of course, Peter, in the dramatic event that took place before he ever went to the
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:32.480]   house of Cornelius, was brought to see the same thing.
[00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:36.520]   You know, it took a vision from heaven to make Peter see it.
[00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:40.920]   Peter as a Jew couldn't understand this, though he was a saved man, though he passed
[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:42.120]   through Pentecost.
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:44.720]   The idea that the Gentiles, impossible.
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:49.400]   So God sent the vision of this great cloth coming down from heaven with these beasts
[00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:54.040]   of different orders and kinds, and the command, "Rise, Peter, slay and eat."
[00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:56.320]   And Peter said, "No, my lord, how can I?
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:33:02.120]   Nothing common or unclean hath ever entered into my lips."
[00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:10.560]   And then God said to him, "That which God hath cleansed, that call not thou common."
[00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:14.680]   And he saw it once and forever, and he went, and he admitted the Gentiles into the church.
[00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:20.360]   He was attacked for it, and he defended himself, as you can read in chapters 11 and 15 of the
[00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:21.600]   book of the Acts of the Apostle.
[00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:23.440]   Well, there it is, you see.
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:28.520]   Before Paul really had become the apostle that he became, it had already been preached
[00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:29.560]   in that way.
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:32.120]   But in fact, you get it in the Old Testament.
[00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:38.400]   There are clear passages there, such as Ezekiel 36 and elsewhere, which show this picture
[00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:39.400]   of the church.
[00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:41.920]   But go right back to the beginning.
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:49.440]   It's there, as Paul argues in Galatians 3, in Abraham, in the whole promise to Abraham.
[00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:51.720]   It is perfectly clear and definite.
[00:33:51.720 --> 00:34:00.120]   But—and this is the thing that's immediately important here—we learn as we examine all
[00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:06.960]   this the danger of having a theory and imposing it upon the scriptures.
[00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:14.400]   What the apostle actually says is this, "Which in other ages was not made known unto the
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:22.720]   sons of men," not full stop, but comma, "as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:25.360]   and prophets by the Spirit."
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:26.360]   What does that mean?
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:27.860]   It means this.
[00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:31.080]   He isn't saying that it had never been revealed before.
[00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:40.080]   What he is saying is this, "It was not revealed before as to the extent that it is now revealed."
[00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:42.640]   It was there in embryo.
[00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:45.040]   It's now in full blossom and development.
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:48.080]   It was there in shadow as a suggestion.
[00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:50.160]   It's now fully elaborated.
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:51.160]   That's what he's saying.
[00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:53.880]   It's as it is now revealed.
[00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:56.760]   It wasn't then revealed as it is now revealed.
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:35:00.360]   It was revealed, but not as it is now.
[00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:04.480]   And you see the importance of this.
[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:10.760]   And what an extraordinary thing the human mind is, even when it's Christian and when
[00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:13.280]   it has received the Holy Spirit.
[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:17.640]   If you read these dispensational writings, I think you will find that generally they
[00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:22.160]   put a full stop after that word "men," and don't go on to quote the rest of the
[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:23.160]   statement.
[00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:25.240]   Namely, "As it is now revealed."
[00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:26.560]   Am I saying they're dishonest?
[00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:27.560]   Not at all.
[00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:32.160]   I am just saying that the human mind is valuable, and mine is.
[00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:36.280]   And that therefore we have to be careful as we study the Scripture, lest we elaborate
[00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:43.440]   a whole system upon what is nothing but a fallacy.
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:49.840]   Now then, what is this mystery that has now been made perfectly plain and clear, the full
[00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:50.840]   unfolding?
[00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:52.600]   Well it is this.
[00:35:52.600 --> 00:36:00.360]   Not the fact simply that the Gentiles are to be saved, but that Gentile and Jew are
[00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:04.680]   to be together in the Christian church.
[00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:08.160]   Their peculiar relationship to one another.
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:09.160]   What is he saying?
[00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:11.440]   Well he's saying this.
[00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:17.640]   Not that the Gentiles are now to be allowed to become Jewish proselytes.
[00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:22.040]   That is what the Jews believed, and indeed they had practiced, that you remember.
[00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:26.040]   There had been many a Gentile who had come to see the truth of God in the Old Testament
[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:29.980]   Scriptures, and he said, "I'd like to become one of you."
[00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:35.800]   So they took him, they instructed him, they circumcised him, and he became a Jewish proselyte.
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:40.660]   Yes, you see, he was allowed to come in, but only as a proselyte.
[00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:42.320]   He was still not a full Jew.
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:44.440]   He's allowed in, but as a proselyte.
[00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:50.400]   Now that's the very thing that the apostle is contending in this particular section.
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:52.160]   What he's saying is this.
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:57.760]   The Jew has come in not as an addition, not as a proselyte.
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:06.240]   He has come into this new thing, the church, in exactly the same way as the Jew comes in.
[00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:10.160]   What he's saying is this, that the church is now the kingdom.
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:16.080]   That what the Jewish nation was in the Old Testament, the church is now.
[00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:18.580]   And that there is no longer that old distinction.
[00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:25.920]   In other words, he is saying that our Lord's prophecy recorded in Matthew 21, 43 has been
[00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:26.920]   fulfilled.
[00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:27.920]   This is it.
[00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:35.360]   "Therefore I say unto you," said our Lord to the Jews, "the kingdom of God shall be
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:44.680]   taken from you and given to a nation, bringing forth the fruits thereof."
[00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:49.760]   And the apostle Peter confirms it in his way by using about the church consisting of Jew
[00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:57.240]   and Gentile the very words that God used through Moses about the nation of Israel in Exodus
[00:37:57.240 --> 00:37:58.240]   19.
[00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:03.400]   "Ye are a holy nation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people."
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:06.920]   The church is the kingdom.
[00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:10.480]   Now then, let's watch how the apostle does this.
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:17.840]   His point is that the old distinction between the Jew and the Gentile is abolished once
[00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:20.000]   and forever.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.440]   He's already shown us that in the second chapter.
[00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:24.680]   The middle wall of partition is gone.
[00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:26.280]   Christ has demolished it.
[00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:29.720]   He's made one new man, so making peace.
[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:34.960]   The old distinction has gone, I say, once and forever.
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:38.760]   But listen to the particular way in which he says it.
[00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:40.800]   This is the mystery.
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:47.040]   That the Gentiles should be, and then he's got three fellows.
[00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:50.360]   Unfortunately, this authorize doesn't got it well.
[00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:55.040]   Fellow heirs and of the same body and partakers of the promise.
[00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:56.680]   This is what Paul said.
[00:38:56.680 --> 00:39:04.520]   Fellow heirs, fellow members of the body, fellow partakers of the promise.
[00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:09.120]   In every single case, it's that word fellow that he uses in the same way.
[00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:12.120]   Well now, look at it.
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:22.880]   The Gentiles, he says, are to be fellow heirs with the Jews, which means this.
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:29.480]   That all the promises that God had made to the Jewish people under the Old Testament
[00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:34.040]   are now open to the Gentiles.
[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:39.240]   Fellow heirs, somebody draws up a will and in his will, I leave so and so to so and so.
[00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:40.240]   What you find in the will?
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:41.960]   Well, here's the answer.
[00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:48.120]   The Jew is an equal sharer with the Gentile and the Gentile with the Jew.
[00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:49.120]   No difference.
[00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:51.120]   They're both fellow heirs.
[00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:52.880]   They've got the same place in the will.
[00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:57.240]   They're going to receive the same benefits.
[00:39:57.240 --> 00:40:00.600]   Now that of course refers to the new covenant that God had promised.
[00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:03.960]   He says, I'm going to make a new covenant with you, not like the one that I made when
[00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:05.760]   I brought you out of Israel.
[00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:06.760]   What is the new covenant?
[00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:08.160]   Oh, here it is.
[00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:10.680]   Your sins and iniquities will I remember no more.
[00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:12.320]   I shall be to you a God.
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:13.960]   You shall be to me a people.
[00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:19.160]   No longer only for the Jew, but for you my friend, for me.
[00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:20.840]   We are in the will.
[00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:26.400]   We are heirs together with the Jews, the old nation, the old people in this amazing promise
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:29.240]   of the benefits of the new covenant.
[00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:30.240]   Fellow heirs.
[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:33.040]   We'll go into this more deeply next Sunday, God willing.
[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:38.120]   But come, let me come to the second term.
[00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:42.680]   Fellow members of the body.
[00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:45.440]   Why do you think he added that?
[00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:48.360]   Surely you argue fellow heirs tells us everything.
[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:50.280]   You can't go beyond saying fellow heirs.
[00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:52.160]   Oh yes, you can.
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:56.480]   And I'll tell you why.
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:41:04.520]   There is nothing to prevent a man when he writes his will to do something like this.
[00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:13.960]   He's got an only son and he's got a family servant who's been with him for 40 years and
[00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:16.840]   whom he has come to regard almost as a son.
[00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:21.960]   Remember when he makes his will, he says that all my properties to be divided between my
[00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:29.120]   son and my faithful servant so and so.
[00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:36.320]   A servant can be made a fellow heir with a son, but he's still a servant.
[00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:38.680]   That doesn't make him a member of the family.
[00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:40.720]   That doesn't mean he's got the same blood in him.
[00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:43.040]   That doesn't mean that he's changed the relationship.
[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:46.720]   He can be a beneficiary equally with a son, but he's still a servant.
[00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:47.840]   He's not one.
[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:49.640]   So the apostle takes no risks.
[00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:57.440]   He adds to fellow heirs fellow members of the body.
[00:41:57.440 --> 00:42:02.760]   Now then you see this is the thing that demolishes that attempt to perpetuate a distinction between
[00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:05.240]   the Jew and the Gentile any longer.
[00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:06.600]   No no says Paul.
[00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:10.600]   It isn't that the Gentiles are simply added on somehow loosely.
[00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:19.400]   They are compacted together as joints in the same body and no one joint is more in the
[00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:21.080]   body than any other joint.
[00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:29.640]   We are jointed together, impacted as joints together in this one body.
[00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:32.840]   There's no distinction any longer.
[00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:35.360]   There's no superiority and inferiority.
[00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:37.920]   The system of dispensationalism says there is.
[00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:41.280]   But there is a heavenly people and an earthly people and that the Jews are going to come
[00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:44.960]   back and have a very special place again in some future time.
[00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:48.760]   It seems to me to be a blank denial of this.
[00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:54.080]   Where we are told that all that is finished forever and here there is one body and they're
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:43:00.440]   equally joints and impacted together in the one body.
[00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:05.880]   And then he goes even a step further and puts it like this that we are fellow partakers
[00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:10.800]   together of the promise.
[00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:14.120]   What does he mean by this?
[00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:17.640]   Well it seems to me that we are driven by other scriptures to say that he means two
[00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:21.560]   things by this.
[00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:27.760]   I read to you in Galatians 3.14 this statement that the blessing of Abraham might come on
[00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:36.560]   the Gentiles through Jesus Christ that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through
[00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:41.080]   faith.
[00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:45.560]   What is called the promise of the Father.
[00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:52.320]   This thing that runs as a golden thread through the Old Testament, this wonderful promise.
[00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:56.040]   The thing that happened on the day of Pentecost and Peter said this is that which was spoken
[00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:57.520]   by the prophet Joel.
[00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:02.360]   The promise of the Father, the shedding forth of the Spirit and all the results of that
[00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:03.960]   amazing thing.
[00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:08.840]   Here says Paul, you are fellow partakers of the promise.
[00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:13.520]   You have received the fullness of the Spirit exactly as the Jew has done.
[00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:20.400]   But it also I think means this in addition.
[00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:28.760]   Another great promise of course was the promise of the resurrection and the promise of the
[00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:33.000]   glorious kingdom of the Son of God.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:39.280]   Listen to Paul again putting this very clearly in Acts 26 verses 6 to 8 when he is making
[00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:43.320]   his defense before King Agrippa.
[00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:51.400]   And now he says I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our
[00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:58.120]   fathers and to which promise our twelve tribes instantly serving God day and night hope to
[00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:04.600]   come for which hope say King Agrippa I am accused of the Jews.
[00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:13.160]   Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you that God should raise the dead?
[00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:18.560]   Now you see what the promise is?
[00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:25.760]   It is this promise that a Messiah would come who would even conquer death and the grave
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:29.560]   and bring life and immortality to light.
[00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:35.320]   It is the promise of resurrection, the final resurrection and the coming of the glorious
[00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:42.680]   kingdom, the new heavens and the new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness.
[00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:46.800]   That was something that the Jew prized above everything else.
[00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:51.520]   He had to suffer a lot in his life in this world but he looked beyond it all as we are
[00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:53.240]   told in Hebrews 11.
[00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:57.720]   He looked to that great promise, this resurrection, the life of glory.
[00:45:57.720 --> 00:45:59.520]   He had it, nobody else had it.
[00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:03.900]   The Gentile was without hope, without God in the world as Paul has already said.
[00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:11.280]   But now he says your heirs, fellow partakers of the promise.
[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:21.920]   And so to you and to me it means this, that we this morning can look forward to the resurrection
[00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:24.960]   of the body.
[00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:29.440]   We can look forward to a glorified body.
[00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:40.880]   We can look forward to dwelling on a new earth under a new heavens wherein dwelleth righteousness.
[00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:49.960]   Fellow partakers of the promise, Christ in you, the hope of glory.
[00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:51.720]   Very well my friends, there it is.
[00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:56.280]   You see the two mysteries which the apostle tells us he has been given to preach.
[00:46:56.280 --> 00:47:02.120]   The mystery of Christ, the whole thing, the particular mystery that this purpose of God
[00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:12.240]   is now in the church and that the church is the final form until all things are wound
[00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:25.960]   up and you and Gentile in Christ and only in Christ together shall share the benefits
[00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:34.240]   of this everlasting and eternal glory and shall wonder to all eternity at the grace
[00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:41.080]   of God that ever made it possible, that ever brought us in and that made us and the Jews
[00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:51.560]   together fellow heirs, fellow members of the body and fellow partakers of such a blessed
[00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:52.560]   hope.
[00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:53.560]   Amen.
[00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:57.020]   Amen.
[00:47:57.020 --> 00:48:00.940]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
