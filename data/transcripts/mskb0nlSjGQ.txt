[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   We get a lot of questions and emails about anxiety disorders and attention deficit disorders,
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.240]   ADD, ADHD.
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.620]   One listener asks if these are merely disorders or are they also sin?
[00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.080]   Is it either/or, both/and?
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.680]   Over the years, Pastor John, as a pastor, how did you process these questions over panic
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.000]   attacks, anxiety, and ADD?
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.480]   Well, as I've tried to think about them, and I have over the years, they really are pretty
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:33.480]   distinct issues.
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.840]   So let me separate them out and maybe we can do ADD in its own podcast.
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.280]   But with regard to anxiety, the answer is yes.
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:52.040]   Paul and Jesus explicitly command us not to be anxious, so being anxious is a sin.
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.440]   Jesus says, "Do not be anxious about your life, what you are to eat, what you are to
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.080]   drink, about your body, what you shall put on."
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:06.800]   And then he gives eight reasons in that paragraph in Matthew 6 why we don't need to be anxious
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.920]   and shouldn't be anxious.
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:15.800]   "Do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself," Matthew 6:34
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.240]   or Matthew 10, 19.
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.000]   "When they deliver you over, do not be anxious how you are to speak or what you are to say."
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.800]   And Paul in Philippians 4, 6, "Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.320]   and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God."
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.440]   So yes, worry, anxiety is a sin.
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:45.920]   God wants us to trust his sovereign, all-wise, all-good, all-providing, all-protecting, ever-assisting
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:46.920]   care.
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.720]   This is a trust issue.
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:58.240]   And he wants us to do it so deeply that death itself is not the ultimate threat.
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.560]   Death cannot separate us from the love of God or rob us of our joy.
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:12.440]   So the godly opposite of anxiety is peace and contentment rooted in trust in God's promises.
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.840]   It's the experience of Paul's secret.
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.600]   I have learned, this is Philippians 4, 11, I have learned in whatever situation I am
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.600]   to be content.
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.120]   That's the opposite of anxiety.
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.280]   I know how to be brought low and not be anxious about being brought low.
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.880]   I know how to abound in any and every circumstance.
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.880]   I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger.
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.760]   Now hunger would mean, I don't know where my next meal might come from.
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.480]   And need, I don't know if my needs are going to be met.
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.640]   And he's saying I've learned a secret.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.800]   I can do all things through him who strengthens me.
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:01.800]   So the great challenge to all of us is to trust God more and more.
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.440]   Because Tony, all of us are anxious.
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.600]   I mean I hope the person who asked this question doesn't hear me say, "Yes, it's a sin."
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.080]   Say, "Well, thank you.
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.080]   That's no help."
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.640]   Well, it is a help because I'm joining you in it.
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:24.520]   There is no human being on the planet besides Jesus who doesn't struggle with anxiety.
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.040]   All of us are flawed in our faith.
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.520]   If we were perfect in our faith, we would be anxiety free.
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:38.400]   And the more we mature in faith, the more anxiety free we are.
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.360]   But I don't think in this life there's ever been a person who when faced with some new
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:52.920]   threat, some new danger, some new difficulty, doesn't have anxiety pop up in their life.
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:59.080]   And then, like the Psalm says, Psalm 53, 6, "When I am afraid, I put my trust in you."
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:07.720]   So there's this transaction that goes on as we deal with the remaining corruption and
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.920]   unbelief in our hearts.
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.840]   Now, having said that, we're all on the same team of trying to grow into greater and greater
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.560]   faith and less and less anxiety.
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:26.080]   Having said that, it is true that there are psychophysical conditions that make extreme
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:34.880]   anxiety and panic attacks, for example, uncontrollable phobias, a real life problem.
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:42.040]   So there's a continuum for all of us, but I do want to acknowledge for some, in these
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:52.040]   unusual cases, the believer needs very wise counsel from those who know him best and knows
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.560]   those physical and psychological conditions best.
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.640]   Here's the bigger picture.
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:04.520]   The physical brain and the spiritual soul are interdependent in ways that we cannot
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.020]   fully see.
[00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:12.920]   This means that there are, and there always will be, physical strategies as well as spiritual
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.840]   strategies for dealing with the conditions of our soul.
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.440]   That's a huge statement.
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.720]   We might want to talk more about that later.
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:26.980]   There will always be physical things you do and spiritual things you pursue and do in
[00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:30.240]   dealing with the condition of the soul.
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:37.720]   What we eat and drink and how we sleep and exercise and whether we, the weather we live
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.160]   in, like is it dark in February?
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.720]   Will it ever, will the sun ever come out?
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.920]   Will this temperature ever get below, you know, above zero?
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:52.800]   The lighting that we have at work, the sounds that we're surrounded with, a chirping bird
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:59.400]   versus a whirring freeway, all these things affect our psychological and our spiritual
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:09.000]   condition, which simply means that there may be extreme cases that require special physical
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:16.520]   efforts, including medication that provide a kind of equilibrium where the more natural
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.480]   strategies can have their best effect.
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:24.280]   In other words, medication may bring a person to the point where they can avail themselves
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:29.400]   more effectively of the God-given natural strategies.
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.760]   And maybe later we could talk about how these work.
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:37.360]   I have ideas about how to sanctify these natural strategies.
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:43.920]   But for now, I just want to emphasize that yes, we ought not to be anxious.
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.680]   And yes, we are all anxious.
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:51.560]   And yes, God has provided wonderful resources, both spiritually in his promises and physically
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:59.480]   with kinds of steps like get enough sleep in order to have the resources that he provides
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.480]   to be content.
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.480]   Good.
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.920]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:07.860]   And on this topic of anxiety, back in episode six, you addressed your nerves as you prepared
[00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:12.240]   to speak in front of 60,000 college students at Passion 2013.
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:16.560]   That episode can be found early in the APJ archive, that's episode number six.
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:21.080]   On anxiety and worry, it's worth checking out Pastor John's book, Future Grace, and
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:25.520]   one whole chapter in the book, chapter three, which is titled Faith and Future Grace vs.
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:26.520]   Anxiety.
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:30.280]   We'll be back tomorrow to talk about attention deficit disorder.
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.280]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:31.960]   Thanks for listening.
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:32.460]   [END]
