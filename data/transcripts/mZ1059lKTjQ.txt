[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120]   People like really smart people in academia, when they leave academia.
[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:11.840]   Are more prone than the average person to end up in more eccentric or conspiratorial
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.520]   or like way out of the mainstream type of views.
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:25.800]   I'm Cal Newport, and this is deep questions.
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.200]   Episode two, 12.
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:46.320]   On this show, I answer questions and share case studies for my audience about the various ideas I write about with a particular focus on the struggle to live and work deeply in an increasingly distracted world.
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:55.680]   If you want to be a part of this show, submit your own questions or case studies, go to calnewport.com/podcast for instructions.
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.520]   I'm here in my deep work HQ as usual.
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.200]   I am joined by my producer, Jesse.
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.600]   Jesse, the HQ looked different today when I came in.
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.280]   Exciting stuff.
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.240]   Very exciting.
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.280]   We've got some trash and some desk removed.
[00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.240]   It's a yeah.
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.680]   Empty.
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.640]   The studio has remained the same, but the other rooms in the HQ have been emptied out.
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.280]   We had junk haulers here this afternoon.
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.800]   When I first leased this office, it was August of 2020.
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.720]   I needed a place to record.
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.440]   I needed a place to do talks and work, do publicity while my kids' school was closed.
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.080]   And it was full of all these old desks and bookcases the last tenant had in here.
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.400]   And I just told the property manager, just leave them, whatever I need.
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.040]   I need desk.
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.640]   Like what else?
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.760]   I'm not going to, I'm not going to go worry about decorating an office a few months into the pandemic.
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.200]   Uh, well, anyways, that, that old furniture probably lasted too long.
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.480]   And so Jesse and I pulled the trigger.
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.640]   We've emptied out the HQ.
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.520]   Now we're going to, we're going to re refill it from scratch.
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.000]   Jesse, I want to go through with the idea that a listener literally suggested this.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.600]   This was months ago.
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.440]   I asked at some point, like, what should I do if I cleared the space out?
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.000]   And I used to refer to this as my cave.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:17.440]   And their suggestion was, uh, actually put in realistic rocks, stalactites, stalagmites,
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.440]   and make it look like an actual cave.
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.400]   We now have that capable.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.080]   It's possible.
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.160]   The rooms are empty.
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.400]   We could do it.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.360]   They are empty.
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.800]   It would be confusing to every single person who came in here to do this show.
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.360]   They'd be like, why do you have a realistically molded and eerily lit cave?
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.240]   We wouldn't explain.
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.000]   Just say it cause we're deep.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.480]   It motivates you to write.
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.600]   Motivates me to write.
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.240]   I sit in a cave like Batman.
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.560]   Oh, well.
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.320]   Um, all right.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.480]   Important public service announcement for listeners.
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.320]   We have changed the way that we collect questions to use on this show.
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.840]   For the longest time, I would occasionally send a link only to my email newsletter.
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.160]   And that link gate took you to some magic survey where you could submit the questions
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.400]   that we would use on the show.
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.800]   We have changed that.
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.720]   The link for submitting questions is now publicly available.
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.840]   Just go to calnewport.com/podcast.
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:12.880]   And it is right there.
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.120]   Anyone can submit questions at any time.
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.560]   You don't have to have received that one email at just the right day to do so.
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.560]   So please go over there.
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.720]   Please start submitting questions.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.400]   This is the first episode where we actually have some questions from the new form,
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.240]   but we need a lot more.
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.920]   So calnewport.com/podcast.
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.080]   You'll notice if you go there, there's a new feature we want to do on this show,
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:42.480]   which is share more case studies of people who have put the advice they heard here in
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.040]   the practice and are now reporting back.
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.800]   Here's how it went.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:50.960]   Success stories, non-success stories, real on the ground information about what it's
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.640]   like trying to live deeply.
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.800]   So you'll notice if you go to that form, you can submit a question or you can
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:56.520]   submit a case study.
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.880]   We want both.
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:03.400]   And you, the listener will hear more of those case studies as we get more of them
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.560]   to actually tell.
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.560]   We should be excited.
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.200]   We do have a good show.
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.800]   There's a good collection of questions, right, Jesse?
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.360]   You were going through those earlier.
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.760]   Yeah, we've got some good questions.
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.120]   We've got a good deep dive.
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.800]   Excellent.
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.760]   We return a phone calls too, right?
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:18.880]   We have some live phone calls.
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:19.200]   Yep.
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:19.760]   We got two.
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:20.440]   Excellent.
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.240]   We do have to settle a quick debate.
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.880]   And so the audience who is watching this episode, so who are watching the YouTube
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:37.480]   version of this episode at youtube.com/calnewportmedia can weigh in on
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.960]   this.
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:44.120]   Multiple people in recent weeks, including Jesse, have pointed out something about
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.480]   the computer I use to do my writing.
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.840]   And it's up on the screen now for those who are writing.
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.440]   My keyboard's a little bit unique.
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.840]   Jesse, how would you describe what the viewers are seeing right now?
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:54.880]   It was so good.
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.000]   So last week when we were talking about doing the, you know, getting the junk
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.840]   haulers in, you put your laptop on and I looked at the keyboard for the first time.
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.520]   I was like, Oh wow, you've been writing.
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.800]   So amazing.
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:07.320]   Right.
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.080]   So if you're looking at this, what you would see is the 10 or 15 of the most
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.480]   commonly used keys, the black on the keys have been completely worn away to the
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.680]   point where you can see through the keys to the, to the keyboard.
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.440]   And then you can see through the keys to the, to the actual
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.240]   mechanisms underneath on the laptop.
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.200]   So the debate is, does this mean I need a new laptop or not?
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.920]   Well, let them know how long you've had that for.
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.000]   You hadn't had that long, right?
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.120]   A little more than two years.
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.640]   That's amazing.
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:34.880]   Yeah.
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.440]   I got it early in the pandemic.
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.160]   Here's the thing.
[00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:37.840]   This is okay.
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:38.920]   So that's the debate.
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.040]   I mean, I have to completely touch type of course, because I can't see any letters
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:47.200]   on this anymore and I can see the Q and the Y, the Z and the X no problem, but
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.400]   most of the letters are gone now.
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.560]   So it is a testament.
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.880]   Unrelated to how I, what decision I make.
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.400]   It's a testament to how I reacted to the pandemic.
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.120]   The way I reacted to the pandemic was, uh, you know, hold my beer.
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.680]   I'm going to write.
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.920]   I wrote a lot.
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:06.240]   I have been writing a lot of the last two years and I wore away the keys on my, on
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.880]   my keyboard and otherwise like pretty new, pretty good machine.
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:09.800]   That's so good.
[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.440]   Even when I was just like a fan, just listening, you would always talk about
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:18.080]   like coming out of the pandemic with like a, you know, full fed, full head of steam
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.040]   doing some things that a lot of other people weren't doing.
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.200]   It really resonated.
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.000]   It's how I, especially early on when it was a little more anxious.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.440]   I dealt with a lot of that of just, uh, writing.
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:32.040]   I wrote a lot, a lot of essays, books.
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.200]   I think I've done like 20 articles for the New Yorker during the pandemic.
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.400]   I mean, I wrote a lot.
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.000]   I'm writing a new book.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.280]   I'm a bunch of academic papers.
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.120]   So got to write.
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.280]   So I don't know if I need a new computer or not.
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.240]   Maybe I'll buy a new one.
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.000]   I should, or I guess I could replace the keys.
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.600]   But anyways, a lot of people were making fun of my keyboard
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.360]   in the last couple of weeks.
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.960]   A lot of people just happen to see it and want to know what's
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:53.840]   going on with my computer.
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:54.400]   So there you go.
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.560]   If you're on Twitter or Instagram, you could post it.
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:00.240]   I think it's a classic humble brag, right?
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.120]   Like, look at my keyboard.
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:06.720]   I'm so, I guess I write too much or blessed.
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.960]   I don't know what you see on Instagram.
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:09.520]   All right.
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.840]   So anyways, we got good questions.
[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:14.800]   Um, before we get into the questions though, like I often like to do
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.080]   the start, these episodes, I like to kick things off, which
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.200]   is what I call a deep dive, where I take a query that's been on my
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.880]   mind for a long time and spend some time with it.
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:30.240]   So the topic of the deep dive that, uh, I'm going to get into today is
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:35.480]   will four day weeks solve burnout.
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:40.080]   Now, one of the motivations was, is there's been a lot of articles about it.
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:43.920]   This is an article that's on the screen now for people who are watching.
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:47.440]   It's actually from February, but it's one of many articles like this that
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:51.920]   I've come across recently that are talking about the, the increased
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.400]   popularity for the last year or two.
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:59.840]   And the idea of knowledge workers in particular doing four day work weeks.
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:04.360]   So typically Monday through Thursday, instead of Monday through Friday.
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:11.040]   Now it's not an idea that is brand new in deep work, which I published back in 2016.
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:15.840]   I talked about the four day work week experiments at base camp.
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.480]   They then were and continue to do today.
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.560]   A part of the year is four day work weeks of the summer.
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:27.640]   And I got into some of those details in that book, Alex Peng at a well
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.800]   timed the book out called shorter.
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.960]   That was all about this concept that came out.
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:36.200]   And this is where I say, well-timed March of 2020.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.560]   So that book was right there for people during the pandemic induced remote work,
[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:44.840]   where we began rethinking how we might structure our efforts.
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.320]   That book was well-timed to be there.
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:51.880]   So this idea has been around last year or two, though, it's gotten a lot more attention.
[00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:53.640]   The pandemic pushed it to the forefront.
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:57.080]   So if we look at this particular sample article I have on the screen, this is from
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:03.920]   wired from February written by Kat, uh, Caitlin Harrigan, we see, it talks about.
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:08.960]   Uh, this concept, it notes that several trials or trials have been launched in
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.600]   several countries in the past few months.
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:15.360]   So this is something that, that has been happening over the last year or two is
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.640]   countries, government funding studies from countries are looking into this where
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:21.800]   they'll, they'll take a bunch of companies and temporarily move them.
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:26.640]   The four day weeks and then interview, uh, the employees afterwards
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:27.360]   about what's this better.
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.320]   Was this not, so there's a lot of these investigations going on.
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:32.000]   Typically in Europe, Iceland was one of the first countries to do this.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.440]   They actually had results back spoiler alert.
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:38.880]   People like the four day work week there in this particular wired article, they
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:43.800]   went and talked to 15 workers at six tech companies that had already adopted a
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:48.080]   shortened work week and found that employees generally approved.
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:51.440]   So that's the actual quote I have up here.
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:55.720]   Um, but some saw it as a mixed blessing.
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.240]   All right.
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:03.840]   So here's the question is this highly visible intervention, a good solution to
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:11.080]   the burnout that knowledge workers increasingly feel my argument has been.
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:20.280]   No, I do not think shifting to the four day work week is going to be a longterm
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:25.680]   or sustainable solution to a lot of the actual valid concerns that people have
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:29.360]   about work, its role in their life and the stress and burnout that it is creating.
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:35.640]   I think by contrast, the issue might be the notion of a work week in general.
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:37.560]   Not its length.
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:40.640]   So let's go back and think about where the concept of a
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.200]   standardized work week came from.
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:47.520]   In the U S it comes from the fair labor standards practice in 1938.
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.640]   This is the oppression era legislation.
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:53.320]   It established 40 hours as a standard work week for many industries.
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.720]   In other words, if you wanted to have an employee work longer than 40 hours,
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:58.560]   they would have to be paid overtime.
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:04.880]   This very much largely concerned manufacturing and industrial jobs, jobs
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:10.920]   where there was an hourly component to the work jobs where the biggest knob you
[00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:15.120]   had to turn in terms of impacting the difficulty of the work was how many
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:18.680]   hours people were actually working.
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:22.120]   This was the context for something like a standardized work week.
[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:23.600]   Made sense.
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:30.040]   Knowledge workers have been relatively exempt from that law because it
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:31.720]   is a different type of situation.
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.560]   Knowledge work is way more autonomous.
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:38.440]   The number of hours you are working or expected to work don't necessarily mean
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:40.000]   a lot in a lot of knowledge work jobs.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.640]   It's very outcomes based.
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:44.800]   You're given work, you're expected to accomplish the work.
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:51.400]   The work week is at best a loose framework for, you know, roughly speaking
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:56.480]   when you might be expected to be available for meetings, when we might expect a
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:58.920]   response to emails and when we might not.
[00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:02.160]   So, okay, we don't work on the weekends, then we can't
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:03.600]   schedule a meeting on the weekend.
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:07.040]   We don't schedule meetings at 8 PM typically because like we have this rough
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:08.120]   work week, but that's about it.
[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:13.520]   There's no notion of, wait a second, I'm only supposed to work 32 hours and, uh,
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:17.640]   and I'm just at the assembly line turning the crank into those 32 hours are up.
[00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:20.880]   So in knowledge work, the work week is that again, just a loose framework for
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:26.040]   setting certain expectations, not the core defining factor of the efforts that
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:29.840]   you actually, that you actually are going to execute.
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.400]   All right.
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:32.440]   So what should we do?
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:38.800]   If knowledge workers feel burnt out, what type of things are going to make a
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:39.280]   difference?
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:46.040]   One of my big arguments is that more transparent and humane systems for work
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:50.280]   assignment, execution, and review is what is critical.
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:56.640]   Moving past the haphazardness with which we just toss work around in the knowledge
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:59.800]   work environment today, where anyone at any time can just say, Hey, take a look
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:00.000]   at this.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:00.640]   Can you do this?
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:02.520]   Do this meeting, take care of this problem.
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:03.400]   What are your thoughts on this?
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:07.600]   Just with an email or a conversation in the hallway or a Slack message, work can
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:10.800]   be dropped on anyone's plate by anyone at any time without anyone tracking.
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:11.680]   How much are you doing?
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:13.120]   Does it make sense for you to do more?
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.400]   Does it make sense what it is that you're working on?
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:16.600]   When are you going to work on this?
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:18.160]   What do you need to actually get this done?
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.000]   We don't have any of those conversations.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.840]   We plug people into the cybernetic hive mind of Slack and email and zoom and say,
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:27.440]   get after it.
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:32.680]   And we end up with these completely overloaded task lists and ambiguity and
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:33.160]   stress.
[00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:36.440]   And I could care less if you tell me that my work week is supposed to end on
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:37.040]   Thursday or not.
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:37.920]   I have all this stuff.
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:38.720]   I have to get it done.
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:41.120]   So we need more humane and transparent systems.
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.520]   Here's how we keep track of what you're working on.
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:44.960]   We can see it.
[00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:48.200]   Here's how much we think you should have on your plate at any one time.
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:48.840]   You have too much.
[00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:49.560]   You get nothing more.
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:53.640]   Here is how we think you should actually execute the work.
[00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:56.800]   Well, this is what the mornings are for.
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.400]   These days are all just concentration.
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:13:59.920]   Meetings can only happen in these places.
[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:03.320]   Transparency, so we can see the system and see the workloads.
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:09.480]   And humanity, which I mean, you are trying to align these systems to the way that
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:10.880]   the human brain actually functions.
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:12.320]   That's the reform we need.
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:16.320]   Ours is a knob that's relevant for the factory.
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:18.720]   Task assignment systems.
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:22.760]   That is the relevant knob for knowledge work.
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:24.560]   And there's all sorts of ideas here.
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:26.880]   Like poll systems is something I've advocated for.
[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:28.360]   They do this in software.
[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:29.520]   We could do this other places.
[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:31.240]   Let me work on one thing at a time.
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:32.920]   When I'm done, I'll pull in a new thing.
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:33.600]   And you know what?
[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:37.400]   My team or my boss or my supervisor can be involved in deciding on what that next
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:39.480]   thing should be, but I do one thing at a time.
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:42.200]   You cannot just throw things on my plate and have me organize it.
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:44.040]   I work on one thing at a time.
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:48.200]   We need a systemic collection mechanism for actually keeping track of all the
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.280]   things the company needs to do.
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:50.640]   Shouldn't just be in my inbox.
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.360]   Shouldn't just be on my task list.
[00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:55.280]   Protocols and processes that everyone agrees on.
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:59.080]   That's blessed by the head of the company, the head of your team.
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:02.240]   Protocols and processes for how regular ongoing work happens.
[00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:06.000]   This is the process we meet at these days.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.280]   There's office hours you come into for short questions.
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:10.280]   Here's what email can and can't be used for.
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:13.040]   Again, just rock and rolling.
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:13.880]   Here's the tools.
[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:14.800]   Here's your handle.
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:15.440]   Here's your address.
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:16.080]   Go for it.
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:16.800]   Doesn't work.
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.040]   Protocols and processes.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:26.080]   In general, trading accountability for this accessibility that we've come to
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.360]   expect is what we would also want to get out of this.
[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:31.720]   So forget this, like, let's just make everyone accessible and we'll
[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:35.400]   sort of figure things out and make accountability be the new buzzword.
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:37.120]   We agreed what you're going to do.
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:37.640]   Did you do it?
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:38.520]   How well did you do it?
[00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:40.360]   What hours you did it?
[00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:41.200]   What days you did it?
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:42.040]   I don't care.
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:44.000]   That's not my business.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.760]   That is something we could be moving towards.
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.840]   I think that's more natural for the type of work that we're
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:49.960]   doing in the knowledge sector.
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:52.400]   Let me throw out one more radical idea here.
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:57.800]   I don't think talking about the nature of the work week is that important, but I am
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:03.080]   kind of interested in talking about the nature of the work year, and I'm going to
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:10.920]   get into this a little bit later in the show, but we assume that the ideal work
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:16.160]   year for a knowledge worker is you work all year with the exception of maybe a
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:17.800]   vacation week here, a vacation week there.
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:20.800]   I think we need way more variety there.
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:25.680]   I mean, imagine a world in which there were alternatives.
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:27.920]   My engagement with this company is six months a year.
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:32.560]   My engagement for this company is it's eight months and four months off.
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:37.040]   My engagement is 11 months and I take one full month off.
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:40.760]   I mean, imagine if you had these different options and you had salaries.
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:46.280]   Adjusted and matching these different configurations, giving people way more
[00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:50.280]   flexibility in how they actually structure their lives.
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:52.560]   This could be a big thing.
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:56.520]   When I've asked this question before, and I think the answer is interesting.
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:17:02.360]   How many people today, if you said, would you be willing to take 10 12ths of your
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:06.200]   current salary if you didn't have to work in the summer, a lot of people say, of
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:14.240]   course, I will go from whatever, 150,000 to 125,000, 130,000, or what would,
[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:16.480]   however the math works out there, I guess it's 120,000 there.
[00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:21.200]   If I also don't have to work in July and August, like that type of flexibility,
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:24.560]   we don't think about it, but it's another way to think about burnout, especially
[00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:28.400]   with jobs where when you're doing the work, it's incredibly intense.
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:35.800]   I mean, if I'm McKinsey or Wilmer Hale law firm, and like our whole model is
[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:39.640]   bringing in incredibly smart people to work on these engagements that are
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:44.120]   incredibly demanding, we're trying to monetize their brains, you're probably
[00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:45.600]   gonna have a lot more sustainability.
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:47.680]   If you had these different options.
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:47.800]   Yeah.
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:49.920]   Here's someone who's going to come work for eight years, eight months, and then
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:54.120]   take four where they're not working and recharging and doing other sorts of
[00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:56.520]   things, you're going to probably keep that employee around for a lot longer
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:58.720]   than saying, look, we're doing a hundred hour weeks until your ears bleed.
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:00.320]   So I'll throw that out there too.
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:01.920]   All right.
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:04.600]   So I think those are the, those are the type of solutions that matter
[00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:05.520]   for knowledge, work burnout.
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:11.600]   So why is there so much energy behind the four day work week?
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:13.040]   Let's go back to that Wired article.
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:15.680]   And I think we can see some clues.
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:17.440]   All right.
[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:22.640]   So quoting an employee from one of the companies that this reporter talked to
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:27.960]   said, this strategy shows that the company really does care.
[00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:34.400]   The reporter goes on to say this arrangement is a boon for businesses
[00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:40.440]   because you curry goodwill without raising pay, without decreasing workload.
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:43.240]   So this is what I think is going on with this.
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:46.440]   It's signaling, right?
[00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:48.680]   Oh, we care about our employees.
[00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:49.640]   We're doing radical things.
[00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:50.480]   This sounds radical.
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:52.040]   We're dropping a whole day off the work week.
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:54.680]   Even if what it really means is you do the same amount of work.
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:58.400]   You just maybe aren't allowed to schedule meetings on one day, but you have to do
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:02.040]   more work on the other day and they feel more packed, you end up in the same place.
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:02.200]   Right.
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:03.840]   It doesn't really change much.
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:08.960]   Like, look, we have no systematic way of tracking what you're supposed to be
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:10.440]   working on, what's a reasonable workload.
[00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:11.560]   That's not going to change.
[00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:12.840]   Your workload's not going to change.
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:15.840]   We don't have a system where we can turn that down by 20%.
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:18.360]   So yeah, we'll tell you, you get a Friday's off.
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:19.760]   Same stuff gets done.
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:22.040]   We look like we are being progressive.
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:25.760]   Uh, and I think they've done a pretty good job of selling this.
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:31.240]   They give a lot of more reform minded commentators or journalists, especially
[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:33.520]   on Twitter who are like, this seems big.
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:35.200]   I like the idea of making a big change.
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:38.040]   They feel like it's sticking it to the companies and that feels good, but it's
[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:41.040]   not really the whole thing I think is a PR exercise.
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:45.480]   We need real solutions and real solutions requires us to get to the very nature of
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:48.400]   how work actually happens in knowledge work.
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:50.640]   I don't care how many hours you tell me my work week is.
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:54.720]   I don't install tires on an assembly line.
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:58.000]   What I do is way more annoying and frustrating and vague and ambiguous.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.760]   So you can keep your four day work week and let's talk about how you actually
[00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:05.280]   assign tasks, how much I should be working on, what are our protocols?
[00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:06.760]   What are our systems?
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:09.840]   So let's see.
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:10.560]   There you go.
[00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:11.120]   So we'll see.
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:19.240]   Uh, if you're interested, this is the type of thing I get into in my most
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:21.320]   recent book, a world without email.
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:25.600]   So if you want a deep dive on some of those issues, uh, I'm pulling
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:26.840]   from, from a lot of those thoughts.
[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:30.840]   All right.
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:32.640]   We've got a good collection of questions.
[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:33.920]   Let's get into them soon.
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:38.440]   First, speaking of work, we have to pay the bills.
[00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:43.560]   Let me tell you about one of our sponsors, longtime sponsor, ExpressVPN.
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:47.400]   I'm always surprised that more people don't use VPNs.
[00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:49.520]   I think it's because people don't understand what they are, but the
[00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:51.440]   technology is actually quite simple.
[00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:56.520]   Instead of connecting directly from your device to a website or service, you
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:03.960]   instead make a secure encrypted connection to a VPN server, you tell that server
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:08.960]   what website or service you want to access and the server talks to it on your behalf
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.400]   and then passes the information back to you.
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:14.840]   So that website or service has no idea who they're talking to, what your IP
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:16.480]   address is, have you been here before?
[00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:18.720]   Where are you located in the world?
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:19.600]   They don't get any of that.
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:22.120]   All they realize is, oh, we're talking to a VPN server.
[00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:25.160]   Who's acting on behalf of someone else.
[00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:29.880]   It's a safer way to browse and use the internet.
[00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:34.120]   It's also a way to take back some autonomy from all these companies that are trying
[00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:38.480]   to scrape all of this data about your behavior that they can then sell just
[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:41.040]   to benefit them and not you.
[00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:44.040]   So I'm surprised that more people don't use VPNs.
[00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:45.440]   So you should.
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:50.040]   And if you don't, the choice of which one to use, I think is easy.
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:55.360]   ExpressVPN is best in class.
[00:21:55.960 --> 00:22:01.440]   It is a simple to install app on the devices you use one click and you're up and running.
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:05.720]   You use the internet like you normally would, except for now, all your
[00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:11.120]   communication is going seamlessly through the VPN, like ExpressVPN because their app works.
[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:14.600]   They've got high speed connections to these servers.
[00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:18.160]   So you get the best performance and they have the servers all around the world.
[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:22.960]   So wherever you are, there's likely to be an ExpressVPN server nearby you can connect
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:25.880]   to, to make sure that you have lightning fast speed.

[00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:48.160]   I also want to talk briefly about better help.
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:56.960]   Last week on this podcast, I discussed how I get anxious as we get near the fall
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:00.760]   because all of my organizational systems have to start getting turned
[00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:03.240]   on again as the workload increases.
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:05.480]   That's always a source of stress for me.
[00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:09.560]   Other people experience the fall in a similar way.
[00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:10.520]   It's stressful.
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:13.560]   It's back to school, work ramps up, people aren't on vacations anymore.
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:15.960]   It can be a stressful anxiety producing time.
[00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:21.240]   If this anxiety is a becoming a problem, if it's something that's uncomfortable,
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:24.000]   if it's something you wish didn't have to be such a big part of your life,
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.040]   therapy is something to consider.
[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:32.400]   And if you're thinking of therapy, better help is a great option.
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:37.160]   It's convenient, accessible, affordable, and entirely online.
[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:41.120]   You get matched with a therapist after filling out a brief survey and you can
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:43.720]   switch your therapist at any time.
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:50.720]   So if you want to get a better control over your anxiety, if you want to become
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:55.000]   a much better problem solver, therapy can help you get there.

[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:12.000]   All right.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.320]   Well, Jesse, speaking of questions.
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:17.640]   What's the first question we have from one of our listeners?
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:19.400]   All right, here we go.
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:21.520]   We got a question from Wander.
[00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:23.640]   He's a financial advisor in Seattle.
[00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:27.760]   He goes on to say, "I have recently been granted a scholarship to do what is
[00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:29.640]   essentially a master's level program.
[00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:34.840]   This really puts me in a position of staring the productivity
[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:36.040]   dragon in the face.
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:40.240]   My question is, what are some signs or smells I should watch out for that I
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:44.640]   would suspect I am doing too much and would benefit from scaling down my
[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:45.520]   expectations?"
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:52.040]   Well, I appreciate the reprisal of the productivity dragon.
[00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:58.240]   That's from old, old school, old school deep questions, sort of the pre-Jesse days.
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:00.560]   We used to talk a lot about the productivity dragon.
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:04.120]   And for those who weren't listening to the show back then, the metaphor was pretty
[00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:04.800]   straightforward.
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:08.200]   When it comes to your workload, what's on your plate, the things you have to get
[00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:12.000]   done, the best thing to do is to confront it head on.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.080]   That's what we used to call facing the productivity dragon.
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:17.040]   I'm not going to try to hide from it.
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:19.160]   I'm not going to try to pretend like I don't have too much to do.
[00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:21.760]   I'm not going to say, you know what, just let's just zone out tonight and look at
[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:24.720]   the phone and, and I don't know, like stuff will get done.
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:25.920]   You look at it.
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:29.120]   Everything I need to get done, the time it's going to take, is this reasonable?
[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:30.120]   What are we going to do about it?
[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:31.880]   You have to face the productivity dragon.
[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:36.520]   It's scary, but in the end, it's going to be a lot less stressful than trying to
[00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:40.560]   pretend like it's not up there on the metaphorical mountain with smoke
[00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:42.840]   billowing out of the cave.
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:47.560]   So what do you do when you, when you stare at the productivity
[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:50.080]   dragon, uh, what are your options?
[00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:52.680]   You can walk the systems.
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:54.200]   All right.
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:57.400]   I'm going to need the, I need a better system for how I get this reoccurring work
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:57.560]   done.
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:01.600]   I need a better process for how I deal with the paperwork coming home from my kids'
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:05.200]   schools, whatever it is, you can make the systems better to reduce the fear or the
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:06.880]   impact of what you face.
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:08.200]   You can look at simplification.
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:10.200]   This is too much.
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:11.280]   This Scott's to go.
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:12.280]   This Scott's to go.
[00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:13.480]   I told you I could do this.
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:14.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:14.640]   I can't.
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:20.240]   It is much easier to make these decisions when you see the whole picture before you,
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:22.640]   instead of just in the moment when you're dealing on something you're late at.
[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:27.480]   And then finally, the best you can do is swing as in take a swing at it or swing
[00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:28.760]   your sword, which is okay.
[00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:30.560]   This just has to get done.
[00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:32.240]   I know it's hard, but I know what I need to do.
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:36.560]   And I'm going to just start swinging that sword, put my head down and get after it.
[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:40.720]   So what's the right way to actually face the productivity dragon and make these
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:41.240]   decisions?
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:45.560]   I think and wonder, it's what I'll suggest for you is set up something like an
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:50.880]   autopilot schedule for the first month or so of you working on this new program.
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:53.440]   And this is where you're really trying to work out on your calendar.
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:57.960]   When and where various types of work that needs to get done is going to get done.
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:02.400]   When you're going to these classes, when you're doing the various school work that
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:05.720]   these classes are going to entail, where your normal work is happening, where the
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:08.880]   stuff outside of your work is happening, where your exercise is happening, your
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:13.680]   socialization, whatever else is happening, move these pieces around, make your
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:17.800]   calendar really crowded, experiment with your calendar to see how could you try to
[00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:19.480]   make everything fit?
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:23.960]   And I say, do this for about a month because it'll take about a month until you
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:26.960]   really understand all the different things going on in your new life.
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:29.800]   Now that you have these new obligations on your plate.
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:33.560]   Now you're going to tell, this is going to give you clear feedback.
[00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:34.480]   Does this fit?
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:39.880]   You find yourself moving all these pieces around in your calendar and running out of
[00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:43.320]   room, needing to grab late night spots or early morning spots.
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:44.680]   And it just doesn't look sustainable.
[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:46.440]   It seems like a house of cards.
[00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:48.160]   You can barely get all these things to fit.
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:50.800]   There is your clear sign that you have to simplify.
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:52.360]   Okay.
[00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:53.040]   I have too much.
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:53.960]   I'm going to have to get rid of it.
[00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:59.240]   This exercise will also give you a lot of feedback about what to simplify, because
[00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:03.000]   as you're putting the pieces together, you're going to get a good intuition for
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.640]   what's really gunking up the works.
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:06.080]   And here's where you might say, you know what?
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:10.800]   Of all the various things going on, this obligation I agreed to.
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:15.680]   It's three times a week and it's at this four to five 30 slot.
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:18.880]   And I can't make the, uh, the new program work with that.
[00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:21.520]   Now I have to try to shift work into the evening and I have to drive over there.
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:22.400]   Like this is in the middle.
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:24.320]   If I didn't have this, I could make these three things fit.
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:28.280]   That's the type of insight you get when you actually see all the pieces laid out.
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:30.000]   So you can figure out, do you need to cut back?
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.880]   And if so, what are the things to cut back on?
[00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:34.600]   That's going to make the biggest difference.
[00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:40.640]   And then for what remains system, system systems, when do I do this work?
[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:41.480]   How do I do this work?
[00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:45.960]   How do I organize things to minimize the impact for the coursework for the new
[00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:50.040]   course, go back and read one of my classic books, like how to become a straight A
[00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:54.400]   student, where we get into reducing friction, increasing effectiveness of how
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:57.960]   you actually organize intellectual material for scholastic ends.
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:04.400]   For your existing job, you should get into read deep work, read the type of
[00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:07.680]   things I talk about in my newsletter, calnewport.com.
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:10.320]   This is the time that tighten down the hatches to make sure the stuff that
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:12.520]   remains is not picking up more work than it does.
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:14.960]   So that is my suggestion.
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:18.240]   That's my suggestion for anyone who's worried about being overwhelmed.
[00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:20.440]   Autopilot schedule.
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:22.520]   When does all this work get done on a regular basis?
[00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:25.720]   Look at that to make your decision about, do I need to do something?
[00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:28.600]   And if I do, what needs to go?
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:31.240]   You want to pile a lot of stuff, right?
[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:31.840]   Still.
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:32.360]   Yeah.
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:32.920]   Yeah.
[00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:33.400]   Yeah.
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:38.960]   Uh, I do, you know, I really try to figure out like with podcasting stuff, with
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:42.200]   exercise, with writing, writing for sure.
[00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:42.520]   Yeah.
[00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:44.400]   And so I get a very clear sense.
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:46.040]   I mean, I'm not just sort of making this advice up.
[00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:51.360]   I get a very clear sense of something's not working and, uh, and, and it's, it's,
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:53.480]   it's how I'm able to be very definitive in my scheduling.
[00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:59.080]   It's how I'm able to say, okay, I have these academic obligations.
[00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:01.000]   Let's say that are going to show up for the next three months.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.640]   I see the pieces don't fit.
[00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:06.760]   I can't autopilot out the writing because I have courses here and here,
[00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:08.080]   and I'm doing this committee here.
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:11.280]   And so what I'm going to do is pull back on this and
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:12.800]   just be really clear about it.
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:16.440]   So, you know, I did something like this last spring semester.
[00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:19.720]   So, so at Georgetown, uh, spring semester is January through early May.
[00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:24.560]   And I saw the writing on the wall because I, I worked out my autopilot schedule.
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:29.040]   That I was teaching two classes and I was chairing a big committee.
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:31.760]   And then there was some other work I was doing as well.
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:37.480]   I was on another search committee, a lot of things fell and I was seeing, I can't
[00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:41.920]   autopilot out, for example, nearly enough time to do the type, the level of writing.
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:44.720]   I was doing, there's this like not the time for that there.
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:48.880]   And so seeing that reality facing that productivity drag, and I made the decision
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:53.480]   of, okay, I'm three months, three and a half months aggressively pulling back
[00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:57.720]   from the writing and then at the end of that aggressively turning on the throttle.
[00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:59.400]   So go back and look at my New Yorker archive.
[00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:05.200]   Piece, piece, piece, piece, piece up to January, then crickets.
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:08.440]   And then piece, piece, piece, piece, piece up to now.
[00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:09.040]   Right.
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:11.200]   Uh, same thing with my writing and my books.
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:15.880]   I sold a book during that period that was going to be a time for
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:17.440]   me to start writing in the summer.
[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:21.320]   And so I was able to work around it and the definitive, this really matters.
[00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:26.080]   As the alternative, if you don't face a productivity, dragon is you try to write.
[00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:29.760]   So a counterfactual version of my life without facing the dragon
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:31.280]   would be, I'm trying to write.
[00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:32.840]   It's not working.
[00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:34.200]   I'm frustrated.
[00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:36.120]   My editors are frustrated.
[00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:37.600]   My book editors are frustrated.
[00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:40.240]   It's taken away from the work I'm supposed to be doing at Georgetown.
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:41.200]   I'm not doing that as well.
[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:45.840]   Everyone is frustrated and I'm just stressed out all the time, but instead by
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:49.760]   facing the dragon and being definitive, I could do my work I'm doing well.
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:53.600]   And I could have extreme clarity to the people in my writing life.
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:55.440]   So they knew what was going on.
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:32:00.000]   And you, you probably remember that was a period where I, um, I, we really
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.040]   kind of tightened up the ship on the podcast recording.
[00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:04.600]   I mean, it was like, we need to get in, we need to do this.
[00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:06.000]   And I need to get out.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.920]   And I was often, you know, in and out pretty aggressively.
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:13.160]   So in that period, do you write at all or do you just shelve it entirely?
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:17.920]   I mean, I still, uh, my weekly essay, roughly weekly essay that I write.
[00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:23.440]   So I write a weekly essay, you know, since 2007, I probably pulled that back to.
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:26.040]   Two times a month, but I still wrote that.
[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:29.640]   So, and by the way, if you don't get that, you should, uh, calnewport.com.
[00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:33.160]   And I was still doing background research, thinking through what's going to happen
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:36.880]   on the books, doing background research, but it was, uh, the, the key points of
[00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:42.280]   the background research is self-paced non-urgent as I have time, keep reading.
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:45.720]   As I have time, do some walks to think about this and take notes.
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:47.120]   If I don't have time, it's not a big deal.
[00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:48.120]   No one's expecting anything.
[00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:52.440]   And I go back and forth and I'll do the same thing with research where I'll take,
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:55.080]   you know, a few months where I do no research and I'm just writing
[00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:58.400]   and then I bring it back in and not to get too specific about my
[00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:00.640]   eccentric life as a, as a professor writer.
[00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:05.360]   The general point here is you face the reality and then you work with it.
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:08.760]   And this is one of the ideas that is in my new book.
[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:10.160]   I'm writing on slow productivity.
[00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:15.840]   Principle number two of the three I, uh, illustrate on slow productivity
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:17.120]   is work at a natural pace.
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:20.200]   And I'm getting better at this.
[00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:25.320]   It was hard for me, which is this notion of, especially with important work.
[00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:31.000]   It it's rarely just, I grind on it day after day, after day, month,
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:35.160]   after month, year, after year, it stuff has to ebb and flow in the shorter period.
[00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:36.440]   And that's okay.
[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:42.280]   Zoom out, zoom out the five years and say, I published two or three books.
[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:45.320]   Some articles I'm really proud of, did some great work at Georgetown,
[00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:46.520]   published some good academic pieces.
[00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:48.080]   It seems like a very productive period.
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:50.400]   Zoom into a particular month.
[00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:52.320]   Maybe you're only really working on one of those.
[00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:54.200]   Maybe this goes on the shelf for a while.
[00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:57.720]   And that more natural pace of things ebbing and flowing less
[00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:02.360]   things than any one time stretch out how things are, uh, the time period over
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:03.720]   which things are actually executed.
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:04.600]   I think it matters.
[00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:08.120]   Actually spending more time on something where you come and go can
[00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:12.640]   actually let it ripen some and add some depth or intellectual sophistication.
[00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:15.840]   So these are all things I myself am, I'm working on.
[00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:18.920]   So it's a good question.
[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:20.040]   All right.
[00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:21.080]   What else we got here?
[00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:22.880]   Okay.
[00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:24.160]   Next question's from Noah.
[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:29.080]   He asks, did the passion hypothesis originate from people who weren't able to
[00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:31.360]   find meaning in their life outside of work?
[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:33.040]   Yeah, that's a good question.
[00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:37.840]   The passion hypothesis again, for people who don't know, it's from my
[00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:41.000]   2012 book, So Good They Can't Ignore You.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:48.440]   The passion hypothesis is a common belief about career satisfaction that says the
[00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:56.640]   way to really love your work is to step one, identify your natural, innate passion.
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:35:00.440]   Number two, match your work to that passion.
[00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:03.800]   That according to this theory, this hypothesis, that is where
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:04.960]   career satisfaction comes from.
[00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:07.760]   It's the match of the right job to your existing natural passion.
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:12.720]   This hypothesis is often summarized with the, the pithy
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:15.240]   career axiom, follow your passion.
[00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:19.640]   And so in my book, So Good They Can't Ignore You, I, I dismantle that.
[00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:24.560]   I say, this is not really where a passion for one's work comes from.
[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:26.800]   It's, it's something that's cultivated over time.
[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:28.080]   You don't start with the passion.
[00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:30.440]   Most people aren't wired for a particular job.
[00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:34.840]   You have to take a job that's available and transform it into a real
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:36.320]   source of meaning, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:38.520]   Uh, we've talked about this ad nauseum.
[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:44.440]   Maybe go back and listen to a recent episode, I think 210, where I get into
[00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:45.880]   like lifestyle centered career planning.
[00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:49.120]   I think that's pretty useful, but Noah's asking, okay, but
[00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:50.240]   who came up with this notion?
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:52.640]   This idea that you should follow your passion.
[00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:54.200]   Where did it come from?
[00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:57.120]   Uh, I got into this actually in So Good They Can't Ignore You.
[00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:58.360]   It's sort of an interesting story.
[00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:04.640]   The phrase follow your passion does not show up in the context of career advice
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:07.240]   as best I can tell until the late 1980s.
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:12.640]   You don't actually start to see follow your passion used frequently in the
[00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:15.480]   context of career advice until the 1990s.
[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:19.640]   It's like when Jesse and I were kids, we were the first generation to really
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:21.440]   hear follow your passion frequently.
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:23.840]   So it's actually a relatively new concept.
[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:28.000]   So I tried to trace its intellectual origins and I, and I had a couple
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.480]   of hypotheses of where this came from.
[00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:33.320]   I thought there was three things that came together in the period leading up
[00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:35.640]   to the late eighties and early nineties that helped spur this
[00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:37.400]   particular hypothesis into life.
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:41.160]   Uh, so number one, I think was Richard Bowles who wrote
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:42.720]   What Color Is Your Parachute.
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:47.880]   First came out in the early seventies, but gained in popularity
[00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:50.360]   in the decades that followed.
[00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:52.920]   What Color Is Your Parachute is a classic career book.
[00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:58.480]   It's one of the first career books to really focus on this question of you
[00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:02.480]   need to figure out what you want to do and then go out and figure
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:03.200]   out how to get that job.
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:10.160]   That seems really commonsensical to us today, but in 1970, for most people
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:13.240]   that really would have come across as somewhat exotic.
[00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:18.320]   I think most people, there was relatively prescribed paths based on where you
[00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:22.800]   lived, your socioeconomic status, what your parents did that was going to
[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:24.680]   specify what you did for work.
[00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:27.360]   You know, I live in Flint, Michigan.
[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:31.080]   I'm going to work at probably one of these factories or, you know,
[00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:32.600]   my dad's a doctor or a lawyer.
[00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:34.200]   So I'm going to become a doctor or a lawyer.
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:36.200]   It, it was more pragmatic.
[00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:39.120]   There's no sure that no, you should navel gaze and figure out what's
[00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:40.280]   going to make me happy and work.
[00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:43.960]   That was more new and Richard Bowles helped articulate that.
[00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:46.000]   Like, how do you figure out what it is you really want to do?
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.360]   So that was a very influential book that made a big difference.
[00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:55.880]   Element number two in the rise of the passion hypothesis, I believe is Joseph
[00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:58.400]   Campbell being interviewed by Bill Moyers.
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:04.000]   Now we're talking about the mid 1980s where there is this famous multi-part
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.560]   mini series on PBS called the power of myth where, where Bill Moyers interviewed
[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:13.640]   the late great mythologist, Joseph Campbell at the George Lucas Skywalker
[00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:17.960]   ranch, and it was the most popular series in the history of PBS up to that time.
[00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:22.920]   And Campbell's a fascinating thinker, hero of a thousand faces, the hero's
[00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:27.360]   journey really influenced, for example, George Lucas and the structure of star
[00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:32.920]   wars, that's why they're at Skywalker ranch in that interview, in that interview,
[00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:34.960]   Campbell said the following, I have the transcript here.
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:41.680]   If you follow your bliss, you put yourself on a kind of track that has been there
[00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:42.880]   all the while waiting for you.
[00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:47.320]   And the life that you ought to be living is the one you are living, whatever you
[00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:49.680]   are, if you are following your bliss, you're enjoying that refreshment, that
[00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:50.960]   life within you all the time.
[00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:55.560]   Follow your bliss was introduced in that interview, or at least I would say it's
[00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:56.880]   popularized that interview.
[00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:58.560]   And I think that was very influential.
[00:38:58.560 --> 00:38:59.560]   Follow your passion.
[00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:04.440]   I believe it's just a, a, a minor linguistic evolution from that phrase
[00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:07.880]   from 1985 to follow your bliss, right?
[00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:10.640]   So we have two things now, Richard Bowles teaches the country.
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:12.800]   You got to think hard about what you want to do.
[00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:14.280]   It's not just, well, of course, I'll be a lawyer.
[00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:15.680]   Of course, I'll go to work at the factory.
[00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:20.320]   Element two, we have this follow your bliss idea becoming very popular.
[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:23.120]   Coming out of this PBS series.
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:25.400]   So those two things are coming together.
[00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:29.720]   And then the third element is just the economic backdrop of the seventies into
[00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:30.360]   the nineties.
[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:34.520]   This is post industrialization in America, where we saw a big shift of our economy
[00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:39.120]   away from more of industrial manufacturing towards the knowledge sector.
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:44.120]   The knowledge sector, of course, is way more mobile, way more flexible and way
[00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:47.440]   less prescribed than the industrial sector.
[00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:51.600]   You would now travel potentially anywhere in the country to take a job.
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:54.320]   I'm going to go work at IBM's headquarters in New York or at the
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:55.920]   Rand corporation in California.
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:57.400]   I mean, suddenly work was very mobile.
[00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:59.320]   You could go really wherever to get these jobs.
[00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:01.480]   Knowledge work is more ambiguous and amorphous.
[00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:05.040]   So you have a general amount of training.
[00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:05.960]   I went to college.
[00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:12.240]   I can write, I'm generally a smart person and you're qualified for a myriad variety
[00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:13.200]   of jobs, right?
[00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:16.240]   And so, so there was way more choice in career.
[00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:19.600]   It was happening as a result of post industrialization and we have follow
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:20.880]   your bliss and we have Richard Bowles.
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:25.400]   Those are the ingredients that I think came together to create follow your
[00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:28.720]   passion as a relatively new piece of career advice.
[00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:35.840]   Some people ask me if the Catholic notion of calling having a calling was this
[00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:41.200]   involved in it too, and I think not the much older concept, uh, the theological
[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:45.560]   notions of callings, like you'll see in Catholic theology have way more of
[00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:47.200]   an element of sacrifice in it.
[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:52.440]   So it's really not about self-actualization in the sense of proximate reward.
[00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:55.680]   I will feel happy today because I'm doing what I'm meant to do.
[00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:59.200]   Typically the theological notions of calling was more about, let's say
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:03.880]   actualization in the, in the sense of better alignment with God and the
[00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:06.600]   structure of the universe callings could be very onerous.
[00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:10.000]   I'm going to do this because it's what God requires of me.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.760]   So it's much less self-focus and self-actualization focused, and
[00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:15.040]   it's been around for a long time.
[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:18.600]   Follow your passion did not come along until the eighties and nineties.
[00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:20.720]   So those are the, those are the three factors I think played into it.
[00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:25.560]   And the only reason why I emphasize that is because it's new and that should give
[00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:29.680]   you confidence when you say, maybe there's a more sophisticated core to the story.
[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:33.840]   The story of my working life, when you realize how new and somewhat arbitrary
[00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:39.120]   follow your passion is you become willing to say, let's step back and say, is that
[00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:44.400]   really going to be what guides me in my career journey or will I have a more
[00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:48.520]   sophisticated take of cultivating a career and cultivating meaning?
[00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:50.120]   There you go.
[00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:52.680]   That's my best guess on where the passion hypothesis came from.
[00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:56.200]   All right, Jesse, what do we got?
[00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:57.320]   All right.
[00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:58.800]   Next question is from Marlo.
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:03.080]   He's an emergency physician, single dad, and also has an administrative
[00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:05.520]   role as a EMS medical director.
[00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:09.240]   He feels like one of his greatest challenges is implementing a fixed
[00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:12.200]   schedule because his schedule is always changing.
[00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:17.240]   For instance, if he spends like a shift from 9am to 6pm on a clinical shift, it's
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:19.760]   then hard to figure out what he, when he can do the admin work.
[00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:23.960]   So he's asking what are the best ways for people who don't have a fixed schedule to
[00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:26.480]   get the benefits of fixed schedule productivity?
[00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:30.520]   Well, Marlo, let's do a little terminology clarification.
[00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:36.000]   Fixed scheduled productivity in the sort of universe of my ideas is a really
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:41.040]   specific concept where you, you fix a workday hours, like I work during these
[00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:45.800]   hours and then work backwards to make sure that your work stays contained in those
[00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:46.240]   hours.
[00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:48.600]   So it's a, it's a specific productivity strategy.
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:50.400]   I'm not sure if that's what you mean.
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:53.600]   When you reference fixed schedule, I don't know if that's what you mean or if
[00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:56.960]   what you mean is something more like a time block scheduled or a pre-planned
[00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:59.320]   schedule, or maybe something like an autopilot schedule.
[00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:02.920]   So I'm just going to throw in that caveat that some of these terms mean things
[00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:06.840]   specific in my universe, and it might not be the same thing that you mean here.
[00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:13.480]   So let's, let's try to clarify this question to my job is demanding.
[00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:17.160]   My shifts are demanding, and I don't really know when to get the other type of
[00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:19.000]   work, like admin work on my plate done.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.200]   So let's simplify it to that.
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:24.400]   Well, let's face the productivity dragon here.
[00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:27.640]   What is the admin work you have to do?
[00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:29.560]   How much is it?
[00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:33.800]   Let's think about the systems and processes and protocols and make sure you're not
[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:39.080]   leaving efficiency on the table here, but once you're careful about this work, how
[00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:40.120]   much time do you need to do it?
[00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:44.520]   And let's not, let's not run away from that answer.
[00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:46.160]   Right.
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:51.400]   And maybe the answer is something like, I honestly need two full half days to get
[00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:51.840]   this done.
[00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:54.640]   So then you have to ask, do I have two full half days?
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:55.640]   And if not, that's a problem.
[00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:58.320]   If you do find them autopilot them, put them aside.
[00:43:58.320 --> 00:43:59.480]   Problem solved.
[00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:01.960]   If you don't, let's move on to step two, which is okay.
[00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:05.320]   You face the dragon and you realize you can't slay it with what you have.
[00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:07.280]   There's too much on your plate.
[00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:13.800]   So something has to give either you have to drop a shift or you have to drop the
[00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:14.520]   admin role.
[00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:19.560]   I know it's always better in people's minds to not give up anything, but this is
[00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:26.160]   the, the core requirement of facing a productivity dragon is to see how much work
[00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:27.360]   do I actually have to do?
[00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:29.280]   Can I get this done?
[00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:33.200]   If I'm careful, can I get this done in a way that is sustainable, that I'm happy
[00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:33.960]   to live this way?
[00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:37.040]   And if not, then something has to go and it might mean less money, or it might mean
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:41.600]   this particular career trajectory you had to become the, uh, the chief attending at
[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:42.680]   your hospital's ER.
[00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:46.360]   Maybe you can't do that path anymore because you have to step away from this
[00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:48.960]   extra admin role because you can't make it work, but you know what?
[00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:50.880]   That's not a tragedy.
[00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:56.320]   Figure out a different path, change your plan, go back and do some lifestyle,
[00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:57.160]   messenger career planning.
[00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:59.000]   Here's what my, what my lifestyle to be like.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:04.320]   Oh, I can't really get there this way because it's just too much work, um, to be
[00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:06.400]   sustainable in my lifestyle.
[00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:07.560]   I vision doesn't have this much work.
[00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:10.840]   So let me come up with a different thing I can do, which in your case with this
[00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:15.800]   very powerful leverage, which is you are a well-trained doctor in E R's, which is
[00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:16.800]   incredibly in demand.
[00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:18.840]   You have so many options, so many places you can go.
[00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:22.280]   So many people who will throw money at you to come do shifts or whatever.
[00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:24.240]   You have a huge amount of flexibility.
[00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:26.080]   You're not talking about your family starving.
[00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:27.400]   If you try to change anything here.
[00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:29.720]   And so this just comes back to the bigger point.
[00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:32.160]   When you face the dragon, you have to be ready for what you find.
[00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:33.280]   So hopefully you'll find.
[00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:34.880]   All right.
[00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:38.240]   I see how my shifts are, what days I have free when I'm sleeping off the night
[00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:39.240]   shifts, you know what?
[00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:41.640]   Thursdays are my best bet.
[00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:44.920]   That's an admin day, or you figure out you have to take something back, but don't
[00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:46.440]   pretend like the dragon's not there.
[00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:47.600]   Don't minimize it.
[00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:49.400]   Don't hope that it will go away.
[00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:50.920]   So we haven't done a call in a while.
[00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:52.080]   Yeah.
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:53.240]   It's time for a call.
[00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:53.560]   Yeah.
[00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:54.600]   Let's hear someone's voice.
[00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:57.000]   We have a Kevin from Minnesota.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:57.760]   Excellent.
[00:45:57.760 --> 00:46:02.160]   Basically asking about when's a good time to rest.
[00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:04.960]   When you're dead, Kevin.
[00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:06.680]   This is Kevin from Minnesota.
[00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:13.000]   I'm a bit of a writer and a teacher and a learner and love the deep questions
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:13.720]   podcast.
[00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:16.000]   And here is my question for you.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:21.680]   I always appreciate how you put hard edges on topics and nuances that help us
[00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:23.040]   improve.
[00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:26.560]   And my question is, how do you know when it's time to rest?
[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:28.680]   And I mean, in terms of the work itself.
[00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:33.040]   So sometimes you get a little fatigued and whether it's writing or some other
[00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:38.200]   piece of work, and I don't know whether I can push ahead and get it done or it's
[00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:42.600]   time to just put it aside for a day or two and let it kind of go.
[00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:46.720]   So love to get your nuances and if you will, a little more edge on thinking of the
[00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:52.640]   question about how do you know when it's time to stop, pause on something versus
[00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:53.840]   push through and get it done.
[00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:54.480]   Thanks.
[00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:58.520]   Well, yeah, Kevin, there's a couple of facets to this.
[00:46:58.520 --> 00:47:03.080]   So how do you know when to take a break from a particular thing you're working
[00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:03.280]   on?
[00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:04.680]   There's a physical facet.
[00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:07.640]   So know your body, know your mind.
[00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:10.360]   I mean, if you're feeling something, you know, you're feeling something.
[00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:11.800]   So know your body, know your mind.
[00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:16.000]   I mean, if you're feeling, if you're tired, if you're sick, you can just feel
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:17.160]   that you're not getting traction.
[00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:20.520]   Even that you do your rituals, you get into the work, it's time blocked and not
[00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:21.640]   much traction is coming on.
[00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:23.280]   Then you need to give your brain a break.
[00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:24.280]   All right.
[00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:26.440]   So, so I think there's the physical aspect to it.
[00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:31.800]   There's also the, I would say the non-physical sort of creativity aspect to
[00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:31.960]   it.
[00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:33.600]   I'm not quite sure what the right word to use here.
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:36.400]   So let's just use creativity, which is you feel fine.
[00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:38.400]   You're not sick, you're not tired.
[00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:41.400]   But you're not, you're not rolling.
[00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:42.520]   You're not making traction.
[00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:48.080]   Like for me, what this looks like with let's say article writing and I have a
[00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:53.800]   relevant story that just happened to me, I think is relevant to this is you know, I
[00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:54.120]   feel fine.
[00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:57.160]   So I'm working, I'm writing, but it's not jelling.
[00:47:57.160 --> 00:48:01.280]   It's just, I'm, I'm, I'm going through the motions of like, I need to get this
[00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:02.160]   done by this point.
[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:03.320]   That's my weekly plan.
[00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:04.680]   That's part of this bigger strategic plan.
[00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:07.600]   I need to get this article draft done and I'm writing, writing, writing, but I know
[00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:08.320]   it's not working.
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:11.160]   And for me, I feel it as a physical unease.
[00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:12.120]   This is how I am with writing.
[00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:15.640]   If it's not completely, if it's not working, it just doesn't feel right.
[00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:18.120]   So there's this creativity, cognitive aspect.
[00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:22.600]   And again, without giving too much details about things in progress, which I always
[00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:29.400]   try to be very careful about keeping, you know, private, I've been working on an
[00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:34.360]   article and I was just locked in, like, I need to get this done because I have this
[00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:37.720]   whole strategic plan of finish it this week so I can start on this next week,
[00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:38.200]   et cetera.
[00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:39.560]   I ground it out.
[00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:40.040]   I felt fine.
[00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:46.040]   So I ground it out and a thing ballooned 7,000 words and it's for a magazine, right.
[00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:48.360]   And it just, it wasn't working.
[00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:50.320]   It just wasn't working, you know?
[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:54.840]   And I, I, at some point I said, okay, I got to pull the rip cord on this.
[00:48:54.840 --> 00:48:57.800]   Take a couple of days off, take a weekend off, come back to it fresh.
[00:48:57.800 --> 00:49:02.120]   I came back to it fresh and, uh, hand grenaded the thing in the fragments, took
[00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:06.680]   the fragments I liked re rewrote it from scratch, took me an extra week, but it's
[00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:08.160]   much closer to where it should be.
[00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:13.560]   So that's the other fear is like, I have energy, but my mind's just not there.
[00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:16.240]   And there that's another instance where you say, I need to step back, take a
[00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:18.800]   couple of days, come back, come back out this fresh.
[00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:21.400]   And in this case, it was a walk.
[00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:27.040]   I took two days off and in one walk, 20 minutes long, I just, the structure,
[00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:28.720]   the structure fell into place.
[00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:31.000]   It was like, Oh yeah, cut that, cut that, cut that.
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.480]   Start on this intertwined this, make that shorter.
[00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:36.280]   At 20 minutes, the whole thing was redone.
[00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:40.160]   But I think without the 48 hours before that 20 minutes, I wouldn't
[00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:41.040]   have been able to have the insight.
[00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:44.040]   So Kevin, uh, that's what I would suggest.
[00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:46.320]   Physical, physical fatigue.
[00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:49.440]   You gotta, you know, your body, you're not going to get anything by forcing it
[00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:53.440]   through except for more tiredness, prolonged sickness and work you're not
[00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:59.000]   proud of, but then also critique creative fatigue, give yourself a couple of days.
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:00.760]   Come at it, come at it fresh.
[00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:01.760]   All right.
[00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:03.040]   So good luck.
[00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:04.320]   Good luck with your writing.
[00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:08.120]   All right.
[00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:09.760]   Ooh, what do we got next?
[00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:10.800]   All right.
[00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:12.280]   Next question is from Mika.
[00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:17.280]   As a professor who studies distributed systems, what do you think about local
[00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:22.800]   first software implemented using conflict-free replicated data types?
[00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:26.480]   Do you think this is a technology that will be more important in the future?
[00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:29.520]   Well, a, a sexy topic.
[00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:33.040]   I don't even know what half those words mean.
[00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:36.320]   But I had a dollar for every time Jesse and I've just been hanging out in the
[00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:40.680]   studio and he's like, let me tell you, and don't get me started, but let me tell you
[00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:42.680]   what I think about conflict-free replicated data types.
[00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:44.560]   I mean, I would have a lot of dollars.
[00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:49.360]   Um, I'm going to tackle this a, because I'm a nerd and I want to hat tip.
[00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:55.840]   I am actually a know quite a bit about the mathematics between distributed
[00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:59.960]   data structures and the provable reduction or elimination of conflict.
[00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:04.240]   So it is a really cool topic, but I'm not going to nerd out too much on it.
[00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:08.520]   I'm going to use it instead to pivot into a, a, a brief little
[00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:12.160]   future of work fugue here.
[00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:20.840]   So, uh, I think no, in the longterm, we are not going to see this, uh, CRDT or
[00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:24.400]   however, your abbreviate CFR DT model taking over.
[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:29.520]   So the key thing to know about this for the non nerd listener is this is a model
[00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:33.920]   where instead of everything being stored in the cloud, and so when you're doing
[00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:37.040]   any sort of work, like on your Google doc or something, it's all stored in the
[00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:39.800]   cloud and you're just talking to the cloud servers and it's updating your
[00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:43.360]   document up in the cloud and everyone can access in the cloud in the model that,
[00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:44.800]   uh, Mika is talking about.
[00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:47.600]   The data is on local people store it local.
[00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:49.680]   They do work on it locally, no internet connection.
[00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:55.200]   And if multiple people are collaborating on the same, uh, Document, then like later
[00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:58.280]   on, they can reconcile the stuff they did.
[00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:00.720]   So when they want to connect to the internet, they can kind of reconcile
[00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:01.840]   and update their local copy.
[00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:08.320]   So sort of any old coder, old school coder, who's used to conflicts and, uh,
[00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:10.920]   CVS, et cetera, this all sounds familiar.
[00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:13.120]   I don't think it's going to be the future.
[00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:14.920]   I think the future is actually gonna be the opposite.
[00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:19.880]   I think we're going to see in consumer computation, a move towards
[00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:24.960]   virtualization and the same that we see with commercial computation.
[00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:27.720]   We're gonna see more and more of the computation behind the things you are
[00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:33.760]   interacting with in your day-to-day life, your phone videos, video games, more of
[00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:36.640]   that computation is going to happen, not on a device that you hold, but
[00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:37.760]   in a server farm somewhere.
[00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:39.480]   All right.
[00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:43.680]   And what you're going to, what you're going to have is a interface devices.
[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:48.160]   It's like a screen, basically a glorified screen.
[00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:52.640]   I think this is clearly going to be the future of computation and
[00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:54.160]   it has a lot of big implications.
[00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:55.720]   There's going to be two phases to this future.
[00:52:56.240 --> 00:53:00.720]   Uh, the first phase, which we're getting close to is where the wireless
[00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:04.600]   internet you have access to is sufficiently fast to send screens.
[00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:05.840]   Right.
[00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:07.480]   So here's what I mean by that.
[00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:11.000]   If I have a good enough internet connection that you can, you can send to
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:17.080]   me exactly what to show on my screen and all the computation of what's being put
[00:53:17.080 --> 00:53:19.720]   on that screen is done at a server somewhere far away.
[00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:23.880]   Now, all I need is the device that is capable of connecting to the internet,
[00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:27.920]   receiving these images, what should be on my screen and puts them on the screen.
[00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:29.800]   So like, for example, you're playing a video game.
[00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:35.200]   If we had a good enough internet connection that the, uh, call of duty or
[00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:36.960]   whatever is running on a server somewhere.
[00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:39.560]   And all that high end graphics that are being generated is
[00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:40.840]   happening on a server somewhere.
[00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:44.360]   And all I'm being sent over the internet is what my screen should look like.
[00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:46.280]   Just the pictures of what should be on the screen.
[00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:51.240]   I don't need a essentially personal supercomputer.
[00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:54.720]   Like what you have, if you have a modern PlayStation or X-Box generating
[00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:58.960]   and doing all these graphics, we can have a whole bank of these supercomputers
[00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:02.480]   somewhere that's doing that work and just showing me the screen.
[00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:04.760]   Same thing for anything, right?
[00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:05.400]   I, okay.
[00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:07.760]   I want to use a Photoshop or something.
[00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:10.680]   I don't need to run any sort of image processing on my computer and
[00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:13.480]   have all these different options that can all live in Adobe's cloud somewhere.
[00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:18.160]   All I need to see is as I click the mouse that goes back to the servers, they
[00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:20.520]   update things, they send you back what your screen should look like, right?
[00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:22.960]   So the first shift we're going to see as internet connections get
[00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:25.160]   sufficiently reliably fast enough.
[00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:31.120]   As a move towards what you can think of as like visually advanced terminals.
[00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:36.080]   Just it's a screen and a chip that just displays graphics
[00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:36.960]   that receives with the internet.
[00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:39.240]   There's huge advantages to this.
[00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:40.440]   Right?
[00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:43.760]   Uh, advantage number one, of course, is now you don't have to worry about
[00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:45.040]   software software versioning.
[00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:47.440]   You can just constantly be updating the software running in the cloud.
[00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:51.200]   Version two, uh, advantage two is you can have incredibly powerful computation.
[00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:55.280]   So now you can have like in your video games, they could be using the world's
[00:54:55.280 --> 00:55:00.080]   best graphic card banks, and you can get a, maybe a fidelity that, that you.
[00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:04.760]   Be too expensive to get that much computational power in your own tower.
[00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:04.960]   Right?
[00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:08.040]   So you now have access to incredibly powerful computation.
[00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:12.840]   If I want to do a video editing, for example, that if that's all happening,
[00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:15.880]   the cloud is just sending me back and forth what I should see on my screen.
[00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:19.280]   I don't have to worry like everyone else does about how much memory
[00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:20.240]   do I have on my computer?
[00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:21.560]   How slow is my video editing?
[00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:24.840]   You'll be able to video edit as if you're on the fastest
[00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:25.880]   of professional computers.
[00:55:25.880 --> 00:55:27.000]   So that makes a lot of sense.
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   Uh, and then three it's better battery usage.
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:34.440]   If all my device is doing is displaying screens that are being
[00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:36.000]   sent to me over the internet.
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:40.240]   I can have a chip that is optimized to do exactly that.
[00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:44.160]   And if optimized chips can sit power, like I have a dedicated low power
[00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:47.440]   chip that just talks to the internet and passes along to images, to the,
[00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:51.320]   the custom circuitry that just decompresses and displays them.
[00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:53.040]   So I think that's inevitable.
[00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:58.200]   Milestone two is augmented reality.
[00:55:58.200 --> 00:56:04.560]   So then once we get augmented reality at a sufficiently usable level.
[00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:06.840]   And Zuckerberg.
[00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:11.000]   So, so Jesse sent me an interview, uh, with Mark Zuckerberg on Joe Rogan show.
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:12.880]   I was thinking about this as you're speaking.
[00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:13.120]   Yep.
[00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:13.480]   Yeah.
[00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:16.720]   And he, he gets in, he he's, he's talking through their AR strategy.
[00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:19.920]   So Facebook's thinking about this, by the way, just an aside, Jesse, I
[00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:20.760]   don't know if you noted this.
[00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:28.400]   He so much corporate speak with Mark Zuckerberg, um, steadfastly refused to
[00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:31.520]   really reference any other company or product in the market.
[00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:35.120]   So I don't, he was talking about augmented reality and he's like, well,
[00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:36.200]   here's like where we are.
[00:56:36.200 --> 00:56:37.360]   He would only talk about Facebook.
[00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:42.440]   He wouldn't note that magic leap exists as like $3 billion in investment and have
[00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:45.880]   a product that's like way more advanced than these Ray-Ban smart glasses that
[00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:50.080]   Facebook produce, they don't mention Microsoft's hollow lens, which has given
[00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:53.400]   a reasonable, uh, anyways, that's another, that's another aside.
[00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:56.800]   The bigger point being is the big players are thinking about this, but when
[00:56:56.800 --> 00:56:58.680]   augmented reality gets good enough.
[00:56:58.680 --> 00:57:04.280]   It's in a completely normal form factor and you have a wide field of view.
[00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:08.680]   And then even the, the visually enhanced terminals are unnecessary.
[00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:15.440]   So I can make a screen anywhere and all my AR device does is communicate.
[00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:19.840]   Do the servers where they send you, here's what you should be seeing all
[00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:21.240]   the computations done on the servers.
[00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:24.000]   And it just has to display it into the world around you.
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:29.240]   So now if I want to make a, play a video game, I can just open a screen anywhere
[00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:30.440]   and run any program on it.
[00:57:30.440 --> 00:57:33.840]   Watch any movie, play any video game, just stretch with my hands.
[00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:34.360]   There it is.
[00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:35.920]   Need to make a phone call.
[00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:37.880]   I don't have a phone with software on it.
[00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:41.600]   I just stretch open a screen, go through my contacts, click something.
[00:57:41.600 --> 00:57:44.480]   All that software is actually running on these high end
[00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:45.600]   virtualized servers somewhere.
[00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:49.320]   It will be the end of consumer electronics as a hardware business.
[00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:52.040]   I think this is a going to be hugely disruptive.
[00:57:52.040 --> 00:57:54.240]   I don't think people have followed this thread of thought through too much,
[00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:55.400]   but this is how it's going to happen.
[00:57:55.400 --> 00:58:00.640]   Dumb terminals is going to, uh, help innovate all the technology needed to,
[00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:04.920]   in a low power and efficient way, stream screens, then AR is going to get rid of
[00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:07.760]   this temporary period of having these dumb terminals, just say, let's just do it.
[00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:09.320]   All in the glasses.
[00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:13.560]   So it'll be very disruptive economically because Samsung goes away.
[00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:16.960]   Uh, Apple goes away.
[00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:17.640]   Right.
[00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:20.560]   I mean, major disruptive things, Foxconn.
[00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:22.920]   We don't need those factories.
[00:58:22.920 --> 00:58:25.240]   There's only one device to make it's the glasses.
[00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:28.800]   We don't have to make 50 different types of smartphones and tablets.
[00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:30.200]   So I think it's gonna be hugely disruptive.
[00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:33.160]   It's probably the more efficient way.
[00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:36.000]   Does I mean, consumer electronics, what's the more efficient way to do this?
[00:58:36.240 --> 00:58:40.200]   Even just thinking from like energy consumption is probably to have giant
[00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:45.720]   warehouses of incredibly optimized machines, virtualizing hardware is way
[00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:48.960]   more efficient than everyone has their own collection of batteries,
[00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:50.880]   chips, and glowing screens.
[00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:52.520]   So it's probably a more efficient way to do this, but it's
[00:58:52.520 --> 00:58:53.440]   going to be very disruptive.
[00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:55.360]   And so Micah, that's our Mika.
[00:58:55.360 --> 00:59:00.080]   That's why I answered your sort of very technical question about, uh, data
[00:59:00.080 --> 00:59:04.680]   structures is so I could ignore it and then pivot into a rant about the future
[00:59:04.680 --> 00:59:05.280]   technology.
[00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:06.720]   All right.
[00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:09.600]   I always, I fit those in, I sneak those in.
[00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:10.200]   They're great.
[00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:14.600]   I love when you riff on that, not really relevant to living your life in a deeper
[00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:18.400]   way, but like I, so I have to kind of sneak them in, but I do Zuckerberg was
[00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:23.600]   talking about, you know, no need for like the rectangular screen and yeah, he, he
[00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:27.280]   doesn't seem as, um, I want him to like be more ambitious about this, but I did
[00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:30.360]   think it was important how he was talking about, you did get that sense that
[00:59:30.360 --> 00:59:33.880]   virtual reality, which they're all in, in, it's just a, it's a, it's a, it's a
[00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:38.680]   whole, it's all in, in it's just a step towards that, that future.
[00:59:38.680 --> 00:59:39.640]   Yeah.
[00:59:39.640 --> 00:59:41.680]   So that'll be interesting.
[00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:43.360]   All right.
[00:59:43.360 --> 00:59:49.080]   So it is the first episode in September to come out.
[00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:53.800]   So as is my tradition, speaking of segments that aren't directly related to
[00:59:53.800 --> 00:59:56.720]   help you live your life deeper, as is my tradition, these traditions are going to
[00:59:56.720 --> 00:59:57.400]   live on Jessie.
[00:59:57.400 --> 01:00:01.000]   Uh, I talk about the books I read the month before.
[01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:07.560]   I briefly mentioned the five books I read in August of 2022.
[01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:11.520]   Now I have to say this list is a summer list.
[01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:16.960]   So a warning, it's very much influenced by the fact that I was on vacation.
[01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:21.360]   So you're going to see, uh, the beginning of the list is vacation books.
[01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:25.040]   And then the other part of the list is I got back from vacation.
[01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:25.320]   All right.
[01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:27.800]   So let me start with golden.
[01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:33.480]   I mentioned this on the show before 2016 book by Matthew Parker.
[01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:39.560]   This is a book about Ian Fleming, the novelist who created James Bond about
[01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:45.880]   the house he built in Jamaica and its influence that his time in Jamaica and
[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:49.600]   its influence on the James Bond series.
[01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:52.720]   Uh, it's a British book, very deeply researched.
[01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:59.360]   I learned quite a bit about late stage colonial England, what happened in
[01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:01.880]   Jamaica, how that country was transformed.
[01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:05.760]   You get a lot of interesting context and a lot of tidbits about how, uh,
[01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:08.680]   Fleming and his life is basically a biography of Fleming is basically a
[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:14.840]   biography of, uh, late stage colonialism in the British empire, all mixed up into
[01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:16.680]   this package, a very ambitious book.
[01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:17.880]   Yeah, that's interesting.
[01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:22.200]   Also a lot of good, uh, you know, uh, cabin.
[01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:25.760]   What you might call, there's a book called cabin porn, where it's
[01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:27.280]   just pictures of beautiful cabins.
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:29.480]   This is sort of like deep work, writing porn, right?
[01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:34.360]   It's, uh, on a bluff writing over a cove that you snorkel in every day.
[01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:35.240]   So you get a lot of that too.
[01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:41.280]   One interesting point to say about that book, when Ian Fleming is a reveal in
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:45.280]   the book, when Ian Fleming, uh, left the service after the war, so world war II,
[01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:48.440]   you know, he was obviously like in the military and that's where he was
[01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:49.640]   stationed in Jamaica briefly.
[01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:50.720]   That's how he found out about it.
[01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:52.000]   And that's why he built his house there.
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:56.400]   He got a job after the war with a newspaper group that owned the Sunday
[01:01:56.400 --> 01:02:00.280]   times and he was the manager coordinator of foreign correspondents.
[01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:03.920]   His contract he negotiated included three months vacation a year.
[01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:07.040]   So that's how he could go to Jamaica every winter.
[01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:08.160]   It's just, this is contract.
[01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:09.640]   He was like, I just had gone in the winter.
[01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:18.280]   So, I mean, of course, uh, this is British class privilege at its finest.
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:20.680]   You could just imagine his boss being like, good show old chop.
[01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:21.080]   Yes.
[01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:23.520]   Uh, you'd go away in the, in the winter.
[01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:25.720]   You can't, you can't work then.
[01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:28.200]   By the way, spot on English accent.
[01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:29.040]   Very good.
[01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:29.320]   Very good.
[01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:30.960]   Just the Scotland sounds identical.
[01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:31.800]   Exactly.
[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:34.120]   I would pass as a native in Scotland.
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:36.760]   Um, but I mentioned this earlier in the show.
[01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:41.520]   Yeah, right now you have to be like a pseudo aristocrat in 19, late
[01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:43.720]   1940s Britain to get a contract like that.
[01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:45.120]   But why is that not more common?
[01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:50.320]   Like, why is if you're Facebook, are you not trying to attract
[01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:54.640]   engineers by saying, Hey, and if you're willing to do nine 12ths of the salary,
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:55.960]   you can take three months off a year.
[01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:57.040]   You would get more people.
[01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:58.600]   We need more variety like this.
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:02:59.800]   That should not be so rare.
[01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:01.160]   So there we go.
[01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:01.640]   All right.
[01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:02.320]   Book number two.
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:04.920]   So I read gold and I said, well, I better read a James Bond book.
[01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:07.800]   I'm reading about his house.
[01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:08.880]   I know so much about Fleming.
[01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:09.960]   I was on vacation at the time.
[01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:11.320]   It's like, I should probably read a James Bond book.
[01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:13.040]   Interesting observation.
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:16.280]   They're temporarily not available on Kindle.
[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:18.480]   I don't really know what's going on here.
[01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:20.560]   Just a standard James Bond book.
[01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:23.320]   American translations are not available on Kindle.
[01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:26.000]   I think there was a, there's been a transfer of rights.
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:30.720]   I think something about Amazon buying Paramount and maybe Paramount owns the
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:33.960]   rights and there's some, I saw something I should look into this deeper.
[01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:35.880]   I saw something about there.
[01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:38.160]   Maybe they're reformatting and going to republish these, but
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:38.960]   it was very hard to find.
[01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:40.480]   So I basically got a pirated copy.
[01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:42.640]   The only one I could find on my Kindle, because I was on vacation.
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:44.800]   So I, and I didn't want to, I couldn't just Amazon a book.
[01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:49.440]   The only one I could find is basically a pirated E-copy of Moonraker.
[01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:54.320]   It's one of the early, it's a 1960s James Bond novel.
[01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:57.560]   Interesting point, two interesting points about it.
[01:03:57.560 --> 01:04:05.760]   One, it has the first third of the book is James Bond playing bridge
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:07.800]   at a fancy club in London.
[01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:14.320]   Second two thirds of the book, he is at a high-tech missile installation.
[01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:18.880]   Trying to stop a villain from dropping a nuclear bomb on London.
[01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:20.280]   So it seems a little incongruous.
[01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:20.960]   I looked into it.
[01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:24.480]   It turns out Moonraker was based off a teleplay that Fleming wrote
[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:25.840]   about the missile and this or that.
[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:26.480]   It wasn't long enough.
[01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:28.720]   Was it long enough when he translated to a book?
[01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:31.560]   Like this is not, we can't, it's not long enough to sell us a novel.
[01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:34.800]   So he's like, well, I'll just add a, a scene, extended scene where
[01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:37.240]   he plays bridge with the villain.
[01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:37.800]   And you know what?
[01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:38.920]   It's a great scene.
[01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:42.320]   Like the whole premise of the scene is the villains cheating and M as
[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:45.520]   Bond come figure out how he's cheating and they get into all this is so
[01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:49.120]   Fleming, all of the details of this very fancy upper crust club and the
[01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:53.280]   food and how they, and the specific drinks that they're drinking and
[01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:54.800]   sort of classic Fleming point.
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:59.000]   Number two, it's a surprisingly modern techno thriller.
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.800]   I think we give credit to Crichton.
[01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:05.240]   We give credit to Clancy is sort of inventing the genre of high, high
[01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:08.360]   pace adventure type thrilling thriller writing that has a lot of technology.
[01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:13.520]   Moonraker feels like it could have been from that same genre.
[01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:18.000]   I mean, it's a lot of the technology of the missiles and how it's going to work.
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.600]   There's these details involved of it reads like a modern techno thriller.
[01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:24.920]   I don't think Fleming gets enough credit for techno thriller writing.
[01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:27.920]   I had, I guess I had assumed that James Bond books were going to be a little
[01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:33.360]   bit more like British and ornate and, or maybe like a little bit more, a little
[01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:38.800]   bit more sort of classic spy type writing where you have the sort of spy who came
[01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:40.640]   out of the cold Alistair McLean style writing.
[01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:44.560]   No, it reads like Crichton this missile and whatever.
[01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:45.280]   Interesting point.
[01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:50.640]   Number three, this was before the space programs got started.
[01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:58.640]   So Fleming's take on space technology, those specific is very wrong.
[01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:01.920]   So it's clearly, he was just guessing.
[01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:03.440]   You know, this was the early sixties.
[01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:08.960]   He was just guessing, uh, what would be involved in sending rockets in his world.
[01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:11.920]   His guest was like, obviously like you can't send a rocket very
[01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:13.600]   far without the fire melting it.
[01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:17.680]   So like the whole plot was around how this villain had cornered the market on
[01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:21.360]   this special material that could hold up to the flames of a rocket and that
[01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:22.240]   that was going to be the key.
[01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:23.520]   It's not even a ballistic missile.
[01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:27.200]   It's just a missile that can go a thousand miles.
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:30.720]   Sub ballistic required special material and just huge thing.
[01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:32.160]   And it was interesting.
[01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:35.120]   All right.
[01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:38.000]   Then, uh, the, the, this was speaking of techno thriller.
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000]   So also on vacation, this was at the house.
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.320]   I always try to find a thriller just like where I am.
[01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:46.080]   They had a Michael Crichton techno thriller that I had not read
[01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:49.440]   2004 state of fear.
[01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:52.400]   And my memory was, I didn't read this.
[01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:55.760]   Even though I used to read all the Crichton, I didn't read this one
[01:06:55.760 --> 01:06:56.800]   because I had heard it was sort of.
[01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:03.920]   Weirdly grumpily sort of like polemically anti-climate change.
[01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:08.160]   Like the whole book was just him being grumpy.
[01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:11.840]   This is kind of what I had heard about, about, uh, environmentalist
[01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:13.200]   and climate change scientists.
[01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:15.040]   Uh, reality that's true.
[01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:18.960]   It does read as like, he's, he was a grumpy guy, but I mean, it was,
[01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:19.680]   it was grumpy.
[01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:24.960]   It's he has, he's long, I mean, just, he, he has citations throughout the book
[01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:28.640]   and he has this character, this MIT professor, whose whole job is to have
[01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:33.120]   conversations with a good intention, but annoying environmentally minded
[01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:36.160]   people who are like, but everyone just knows that blah, blah, blah,
[01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:36.960]   about climate change.
[01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:40.080]   And then the MIT professor speaking as a proxy for Crichton would be like,
[01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:41.520]   well, it's actually not true.
[01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:42.240]   Blah, blah, blah.
[01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:44.560]   And then Crichton would put real citations under there.
[01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:45.060]   So I don't know.
[01:07:45.060 --> 01:07:48.320]   Someone got under his skin about this.
[01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:51.360]   Um, I think a green piece boat ran over his dog or something.
[01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:51.760]   I'm not sure.
[01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:52.400]   So that is true.
[01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:58.800]   Also, it's not his best unrelated to that because it starts too slow.
[01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:02.800]   And it's, it's, it's 150 pages before you're really rolling at what the actual
[01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:03.760]   plot is.
[01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:08.960]   Once it gets rolling though, actually very well paced thriller, really great
[01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:09.840]   set pieces.
[01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:12.640]   And we've got, there's one in Antarctica.
[01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:13.440]   That's pretty cool.
[01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:17.200]   The, and again, this speaks to his grumpiness.
[01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:21.200]   There's a, a actor who's clearly supposed to be Martin Sheen.
[01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:24.480]   It's an actor who played the president on TV.
[01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:24.960]   Actually.
[01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:25.600]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:26.560]   The timing's right.
[01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:33.360]   He was like very environmentalist spoiler alert gets eaten by cannibals in the Solomon
[01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:34.000]   Islands.
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:34.640]   It's anyways.
[01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:35.440]   So here's what I'd say.
[01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:37.760]   If you can get through a hundred pages, it's a, it's a fine paced thriller.
[01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:39.360]   He's a, he's good at pacing thrillers.
[01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:44.240]   And if you don't like climate change, you'll love it, but it's also otherwise kind of
[01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:44.880]   annoying.
[01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:45.760]   All right.
[01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:51.440]   Quickly, two other books, Washington goes to war written by David Brinkley in the
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:54.880]   1980s, David Brinkley, the former ABC news correspondent.
[01:08:54.880 --> 01:09:00.160]   It is a book about Washington DC and the transformation it made because of world
[01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:00.880]   war II.
[01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:05.440]   And the, the interesting thing about the book is that in the eighties, when Brinkley
[01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:11.120]   was writing this, the leaders, the people who were not 18 year olds, but were a little
[01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:14.240]   bit older during world war II, they were all dying.
[01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:17.600]   And so there was this sort of race against time where he went to gather all these oral
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:18.000]   histories.
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.080]   And if you live in Washington DC, it's a cool book.
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:27.120]   It talks about how 1940 Washington DC is a sleepy, very Southern town.
[01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:29.760]   And by 1945, it's a completely different thing.
[01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:32.320]   So if you live in DC, very interesting.
[01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:33.920]   If you don't, probably not well-written though.
[01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:38.720]   Brinkley's art, it's a really good, really well-written nonfiction book.
[01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:39.520]   So hats off.
[01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:49.520]   And then finally, uh, Tolkien, the 2015 biography of Tolkien written by Raymond Edwards, caveat
[01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:52.320]   inter, it is an academic biography.
[01:09:52.320 --> 01:10:00.960]   So it really gets deep into the, the work academically that Tolkien was working on and
[01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:04.240]   its influence on the books he eventually wrote.
[01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:08.720]   So this is, it's written by a scholar who's in a similar field.
[01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:14.480]   And it's the study of, it's the study of ancient linguistics, but, but from a standpoint of
[01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:17.520]   using the language to try to recreate stuff about the culture.
[01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:20.160]   And it's a very precise field.
[01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:22.640]   And so it can be a little bit rough going two things.
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:24.160]   I'll point out about this, then we'll move on.
[01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:31.200]   Number one, uh, the reason why Lord of the Rings was so successful is that Tolkien just
[01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:38.560]   spent decades building a mythology for Anglo-Saxon England because there wasn't one.
[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:42.400]   So there was a, a founding mythology for Norse culture.
[01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:47.040]   There's a founding mythology for Germanic cultures, uh, but it was lost, whatever this
[01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:49.760]   was for Britain was lost.
[01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:53.120]   And so he was basically creating one from scratch and he was spent decades.
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:55.280]   He called it his legit legendarium.
[01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:59.840]   And he, and at some point he, he kind of moved away from it being specifically about England
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:01.280]   and about a sort of fantastical realm.
[01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:05.760]   That is what he pulled from for the Hobbit a little bit, and then deeply for Lord of
[01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:06.000]   the Rings.
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:09.920]   So he had just decades of work as someone who is, uh, it's called philology is what
[01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:14.720]   they called it back then an expert at ancient languages and its connection to culture and
[01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:15.440]   mythology.
[01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:17.440]   And he had all of that worked out.
[01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:23.120]   So that's why when you read Lord of the Rings, it feels like one of these lost culture books
[01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:25.360]   where they're just referencing this rich, deep world.
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:26.240]   It feels like it's real.
[01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:29.520]   It's because he, he, he not only created this world, but he created this world with
[01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:30.880]   academic soundness.
[01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:40.080]   I mean, this is a guy who for fun was organizing, uh, I I I Icelandic, uh, Icelandic mythology
[01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:45.120]   reading groups where they would read in the ancient Islandic languages, you know, saw
[01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:46.000]   Viking sagas.
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.320]   And so that's why that was so good.
[01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:51.840]   And why it's so hard, nothing else really approaches the depth.
[01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:55.360]   You get more of the rings that, uh, that sense of reality.
[01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:59.040]   If there's a deep culture here that just takes place on it's because it was like the world's
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:01.040]   expert on doing that, who spent his whole life doing it.
[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:06.240]   Number two, it's a painful book to read if you're a professor, because the whole thing
[01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:09.040]   is about his frustration with academic administrative load.
[01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:17.760]   I mean, his whole life was defined by being overwhelmed by academic load and, and, and
[01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:19.200]   non-research type work.
[01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:22.000]   And he was constantly short on money and constantly stressed out.
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.080]   And this was sort of post-war liberal England.
[01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:27.280]   So even after you couldn't just sort of leave and be like, I'm just going to write because
[01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:32.160]   even after Lord of the Rings became a huge hit, the taxation rates were such an England
[01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:38.240]   at the time that as Edwards talks about it, you know, it helped, but like, it didn't make
[01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:41.760]   him wealthy even at like a lower level.
[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:46.640]   Because you could lose like 80 plus percent of your royalty income like that.
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:47.680]   The government was like, thank you.
[01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:50.720]   So he was not, so that's, so it's not like he could.
[01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:55.520]   So even at the, the very height of his success, like he couldn't, wasn't making them that
[01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:56.080]   that wealthy.
[01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:57.520]   So interesting.
[01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:00.800]   So it stressed me out, Jesse, though, all I was like, man, this is just like detailing.
[01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:05.840]   It makes modern academic life seem free and flexible and great.
[01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:10.640]   I mean, Oxford in the early part of the 20th century just sounds like it was brutal.
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:12.400]   Just the work they would pour on you.
[01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:17.760]   And it was in the infighting and it's an interesting portrait of academia.
[01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:21.680]   Talk about slow productivity though, when he was coming up with that world, right?
[01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:22.320]   Decades.
[01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:22.640]   Yeah.
[01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:23.120]   Yeah.
[01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:26.080]   And then even he was writing these books like the Hobbit.
[01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:31.040]   It's a 10 year window between when he was like starting to work out the story for his
[01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:31.360]   kids.
[01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:35.840]   And when he sort of finally published it, like you just spend decades on things.
[01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:36.080]   Yeah.
[01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:38.000]   It's definitely slow productivity.
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:42.800]   Like you can't have Lord of the Rings without 20 years of, uh, philology.
[01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:43.600]   That's incredible.
[01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:43.760]   Yeah.
[01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:45.680]   So it was a cool book.
[01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:47.120]   Again, it's not super approachable.
[01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:48.720]   His son wrote a book.
[01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:53.520]   Christopher wrote a book that gets really into like his work habits and stuff like this
[01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:55.600]   and focuses more on the Lord of the Rings.
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:14:01.280]   Like that's probably the better book than this, unless you're like you're into linguistics.
[01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:03.440]   All right.
[01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:04.400]   Well, let's take a quick break here.
[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:06.080]   Let me talk briefly about a couple more sponsors.
[01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:08.240]   And then I have a few more questions I want to get to.
[01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:11.440]   So let's talk ladder.
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:14.320]   You know, you need life insurance.
[01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:18.640]   I have life insurance, but I was told recently that I need more.
[01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:19.840]   We have to adjust it.
[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:24.240]   If this was a couple of years ago, I would have been stymied.
[01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:24.480]   Okay.
[01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:27.600]   How do I figure out how to get more life insurance?
[01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:29.040]   How to make sure I'm getting a good price today?
[01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:32.880]   I'm not, I'm just going to use ladder, right?
[01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:35.120]   So ladder makes getting life insurance.
[01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:36.400]   Simple.
[01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:41.360]   It's a hundred percent digital, no doctors, no needles, no paperwork.
[01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:44.960]   When you apply for $3 million in coverage or less, you just answer a few questions
[01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:46.720]   about your health and an application.
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.480]   You just need a few minutes and a phone and laptop to apply.
[01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:52.160]   Their smart algorithms will then work in real time.
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:54.720]   So you'll find out if you're instantly approved and they will show you options
[01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:57.360]   and you can choose and sign up right there.
[01:14:57.360 --> 01:14:59.760]   No hidden fees, cancel anytime, get a full refund.
[01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:05.600]   If you change your mind in the first 30 days, ladder only deals with insurers with long
[01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:11.040]   proven histories of paying claims that are rated A or A plus by AM best.
[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:12.960]   This makes it simple.
[01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:15.680]   Go there, fill in your info, give you some options.
[01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:17.280]   What's the price and coverage I like?
[01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:20.800]   Click the button, move on with living.
[01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:26.000]   So go to ladderlife.com/deep today to see if you're instantly approved.
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:32.000]   That's L A D D E R life.com/deep ladderlife.com/deep.
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:39.600]   Let's also talk about our friends at my body tutor.
[01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:44.480]   I've known Adam Gilbert, the founder of my body tutor for many years.
[01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:48.800]   Used to be the fitness column for my newsletter back in the day.
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:53.680]   His company, my body tutor is a 100% online coaching program that solves the biggest
[01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:56.800]   problem in health and fitness, which is lack of consistency.
[01:15:56.800 --> 01:16:00.960]   You know what you want to, you need to do, but you just don't do it.
[01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:03.520]   This is where my body tutor comes in.
[01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:11.040]   When you sign up with them, you're matched with a coach who you work with digitally.
[01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:12.160]   So you work with them online.
[01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:14.400]   They help you come up with a plan for fitness, for eating.
[01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:18.160]   And then you report each day through their easy to use app, how the day went.
[01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:19.120]   They give you feedback.
[01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:20.640]   They answer your questions.
[01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:25.360]   It is that accountability you need to reach consistency.
[01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:27.360]   It's not just you saying, should I work out today?
[01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:30.000]   It's you thinking, I'm going to talk to my coach at the end of this day.
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:33.520]   What do I want to report that I actually got done?
[01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:34.560]   So it's a great idea.
[01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:38.560]   One of those ideas you hear, you're like, of course, this makes sense.
[01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:40.720]   And Adam has been doing this for years and years and years.
[01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:42.560]   So he's figured out how to make it work.
[01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:49.040]   So if you're serious about getting fit, go to my body tutor.com and mention deep
[01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:52.240]   questions when you sign up and Adam will give you $50 off your first month.
[01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:56.480]   That's my body tutor, t-u-t-o-r.com.
[01:16:56.480 --> 01:17:00.000]   Mention deep questions to get $50 off your first month.
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.840]   All right, let's do another call, Jesse.
[01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:04.320]   I like these.
[01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:05.200]   All right.
[01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:07.200]   We got a call about smartwatches.
[01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:07.840]   Hello, Cal.
[01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:09.040]   My name is Connor Beck.
[01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:14.400]   I'm a copywriter and content marketing specialist from St. Paul, Minnesota.
[01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:18.880]   And my question has to do with smartwatch technology.
[01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:23.920]   So I think I know what your answer to this question might be, but I'll ask it anyways.
[01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:27.760]   I just wanted to get your general thoughts on smartwatches.
[01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:34.160]   I really try and not stay glued to my phone or get too distracted throughout the day.
[01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:41.280]   But I thought maybe I could use a smartwatch in a very simplified way in order to screen
[01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:44.800]   out text messages that are not important versus those that are.
[01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:50.320]   My partner occasionally texts me throughout the day and sometimes it is very time sensitive
[01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:54.560]   and important in terms of what she texts me about.
[01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:58.960]   So again, I think I might know your answer, but I'm just wondering what you think of smartwatch
[01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:05.040]   technology and if that technology can be used in a very simplified way so that it actually
[01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:09.840]   helps you eliminate distraction rather than create more distraction.
[01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:16.480]   And if you can use that technology in a way that allows you to tune out distractions rather
[01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:18.400]   than be overcome by that.
[01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:20.960]   So thanks again for your insight and your wisdom.
[01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:22.560]   It is very much appreciated.
[01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:29.360]   Thank you to both you and Jesse for sharing the deep life and keep up the good work.
[01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:29.840]   Thank you.
[01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:35.440]   Well, so Connor with smartwatches, we should separate two different common uses.
[01:18:35.440 --> 01:18:37.520]   So there's productivity.
[01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:41.280]   That's where we'll, that's the category where we'll put what you are talking about now.
[01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:46.640]   So looking at text messages and emails, being able to communicate through your watch for
[01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:47.920]   productivity purposes.
[01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:53.600]   Then there's fitness, which is a whole other world, which I'll put aside for now.
[01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:58.880]   So in the productivity world, as you seem to be guessing, no, I'm not that impressed
[01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:04.240]   by the idea of needing a smartwatch to make you more productive.
[01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:09.040]   I think you should be spending less time with notifications, not more.
[01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:11.840]   I don't buy the screening argument.
[01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:14.720]   So there's two possible responses here.
[01:19:14.720 --> 01:19:19.200]   One is what would happen if, and this is the way I typically run things.
[01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:22.480]   I check my phone sometimes.
[01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:29.200]   And so text messages that come in when I don't have my phone with me, I won't see for a
[01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:29.700]   while.
[01:19:29.700 --> 01:19:33.040]   The right answer to that question is nothing bad will happen.
[01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:37.920]   And you can come up with a lot of scenarios where, well, so my partner is literally on
[01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:38.800]   fire.
[01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:46.000]   And if I don't get the text message in time, I can't use this app I have set up to trigger
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:49.600]   a complex Rube Goldberg style watering system that will put out our flames.
[01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:51.920]   You can come up with these scenarios, but here's the thing.
[01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:56.080]   Until just about a minute ago, we did not have the ability to contact people like that.
[01:19:56.080 --> 01:20:02.080]   And very few people burn to death because their partners couldn't access to Rube Goldberg
[01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:02.800]   watering system.
[01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:04.400]   So we were fine without that before.
[01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:05.840]   I think most people would be fine today.
[01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:08.880]   It's easy to come up with those scenarios, but they just don't happen enough.
[01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:11.200]   They don't happen enough.
[01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:18.080]   And when they do happen, the cost is such that it's not worth months and months of
[01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:23.520]   consistent distraction because every four months, you missed a call that caused someone
[01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:24.080]   to get mad at you.
[01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:24.880]   I say fair trade.
[01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:26.960]   All right.
[01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:30.400]   Number two, I would say about that is, okay, if you really are worried about it because
[01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:34.000]   your partner spends a lot of time around fire and you spent a long time building that Rube
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:39.040]   Goldberg apparatus, then just do the extra five minutes of work to set up the filter
[01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:46.080]   on your phone so that for calls, you have a white list and people on that list, their
[01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:51.360]   call comes through, put their number on it, put your ringer on.
[01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:53.040]   All right.
[01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:55.280]   Call here if there's really an emergency.
[01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:56.400]   You know, this comes up a lot.
[01:20:56.400 --> 01:21:03.920]   I talked about this in my book, A World Without Email, where this was in the context of
[01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:06.800]   business where you're making yourself less accessible.
[01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:09.120]   And we called it the steam valve.
[01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:12.960]   You have the emergency steam valve where you say, okay, I know I'm not going to be as
[01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:17.200]   accessible on email or Slack or whatever, whatever the plan is you're talking about,
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:17.920]   but don't worry.
[01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:19.760]   We have an emergency backup.
[01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:21.440]   Call this phone number.
[01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:23.840]   So there's always a way you can reach me.
[01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:26.160]   There is no actual period where you can't reach me.
[01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:32.000]   And the whole point of those backup emergency steam valves, we called it strategies, was
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:35.840]   not so that you could avert emergencies because they never happen.
[01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:39.600]   You talk to people who set up like, okay, here's my special number.
[01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:43.840]   Call me if you can't wait till the next time I'm supposed to be online or my office hours
[01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:44.560]   or whatever.
[01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:45.920]   No one ever calls.
[01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:47.520]   The emergencies don't happen.
[01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:49.600]   They exist just so that people feel better.
[01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:51.680]   They know if they really had to reach you, they could.
[01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:54.640]   And I always thought that was an interesting observation is that we're worried that all
[01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:55.920]   these emergencies are happening.
[01:21:55.920 --> 01:21:57.440]   They rarely do.
[01:21:58.720 --> 01:22:03.520]   The potential existence of these specters should not be sufficient to get you to live
[01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:06.240]   all of your time in a much more distracted state.
[01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:10.800]   So there's a question like, what watch do I use?
[01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:18.640]   As Jesse will attest, I actually hang off of my belt, an old fashioned sand hourglass.
[01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:19.280]   That's true, Jesse.
[01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:20.480]   It's true.
[01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:23.200]   So I have a sundial I consult.
[01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:29.280]   And so when the shadow gets to the top of an hour, I flip over the hourglass.
[01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:30.720]   It weighs about seven pounds.
[01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:33.040]   It's about yay big, but you know, it's simple.
[01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:35.600]   You don't run out of batteries with your sand.
[01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:36.240]   Am I right, Jesse?
[01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:45.520]   No, actually, I will say the watch I use is like my favorite, my favorite physical object
[01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:46.160]   that I own.
[01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:47.440]   So I'm not in the cars.
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:51.040]   I don't dress very well or collect a lot of things, but I do.
[01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:54.800]   My watch is like very symbolic to me.
[01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:56.000]   It is something I really enjoy.
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:01.120]   So I use a, uh, it's upside down here and a mega speedmaster,
[01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:07.680]   highly analog winded every day with a little, uh, mechanism.
[01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:10.240]   Its mechanism is brilliantly engineered.
[01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:11.920]   They updated this in 2021.
[01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:16.640]   It loses, you know, a second in it per day or something.
[01:23:16.640 --> 01:23:18.800]   So there's just like beautiful engineering inside of this thing.
[01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:23.920]   No batteries, no electricity, no quartz crystals, no text messages being shown through.
[01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:28.480]   And the backstory I like about this, other than being like a nice, like well engineered
[01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:33.760]   piece of analog handicraft is that this was the watch that was approved by NASA for the
[01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:34.560]   Apollo missions.
[01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:40.240]   Speedmaster went into space and you can get a lot of pictures of the astronauts.
[01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:42.160]   They actually wore it on the moon.
[01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:46.400]   They would, they got bigger straps that could go around the outside of the UVA suits, but
[01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:50.160]   I liked it as a metaphor to this that I think is nice for the type of techno criticism I
[01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:57.360]   do, which is when Apollo 13 was having their famed troubles on the way to the moon, they
[01:23:57.360 --> 01:24:00.160]   had to shut down all the computers to save battery power, right?
[01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:01.680]   So they shut down all the computers.
[01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:07.600]   And so they're just, this thing was just flying analog and they had to do these burns of
[01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:13.600]   the engine to correct their trajectory so that they want to skip off the atmosphere
[01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:14.080]   of the earth.
[01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:16.560]   They had to do these precise burns, but the computers were shut down.
[01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:18.560]   And so how did they do them?
[01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:26.320]   Well, they had a reticule, like a little crosshairs, which they aimed at a very particular,
[01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:29.680]   you know, I think it was the horizon, the terminal horizon on the moon.
[01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:33.280]   And then Lovell timed it with the Speedmaster.
[01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:38.400]   So this analog piece of beautifully engineered gears, when all the electricity had to be
[01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:43.120]   turned off, essentially it was this piece of analog handicraft that actually that plus
[01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:48.720]   a crosshairs plus fire is how the astronauts did what otherwise a computer would do.
[01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:54.880]   So this is a nice metaphor about the beauty and analog simplicity versus the complexities
[01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:57.440]   and distraction of the digital.
[01:24:57.440 --> 01:25:03.520]   So I can use that all to justify otherwise a sort of kind of absurdly expensive thing
[01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:04.240]   to wear on your wrist.
[01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:06.740]   There we go.
[01:25:06.740 --> 01:25:10.960]   All right, let's do another question.
[01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:11.760]   We got time.
[01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:14.000]   OK, this question is from Jeffrey.
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:19.840]   He talks about you introduced the idea of feedback councils in episode 200.
[01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:21.840]   Would you speak more about starting them up?
[01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:24.480]   How formal, informal to create them?
[01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:27.040]   I mean, do you officially ask them to join your council?
[01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:29.920]   How frequently would you inquire with them and so forth?
[01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:37.120]   Yes, the idea behind feedback councils, again, from episode 200 is you do want feedback in
[01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:40.320]   your life about what you're working on or how you think about things.
[01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:45.200]   You just don't want that feedback to come from Twitter or Instagram or TikTok.
[01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:51.200]   And we got into it, these these digital social networks, the feedback from those networks.
[01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:54.960]   It's highly salient and our mind takes it seriously, but it's not at all representative
[01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:58.320]   and it can warp the way you think and keep you away from things that are important or
[01:25:58.320 --> 01:25:59.440]   move you in weird directions.
[01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:05.360]   So what I recommended was having a diverse group of individuals who you trust and know
[01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:10.560]   you sample the feedback from them on things you're thinking or doing the way you're in
[01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:13.760]   the world, the projects you're working on and use that as your primary feedback.
[01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:18.560]   Not whether people are yelling at you on Twitter, not whether or not you got a thumbs up or
[01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:19.760]   thumbs down on Instagram.
[01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:21.920]   So how do you put together these councils?
[01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:26.960]   No, you don't don't formally call them that or tell people that's what you're doing, because
[01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:27.600]   it's kind of weird.
[01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:32.560]   Like within this small circle of trust, we're weird, but it's good.
[01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:34.640]   But the outside world doesn't understand that.
[01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:36.960]   So you don't have to tell them that's what you're doing.
[01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:39.120]   What's more important is it's people you already know.
[01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:45.840]   You start evolving your relationship to the point where it's not unusual if you ask them,
[01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:50.560]   hey, can you take a look at this or that you have when you typically just have conversations
[01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:54.400]   to get together for drinks, you guys are just chatting that you push the conversation sometimes
[01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:59.040]   towards topics you you care about or you're confused by or maybe especially if you have
[01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:02.400]   a strong view on something and you're like, I don't know, man, it might this is a real
[01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:05.040]   good view or my it might be a little hot headed here.
[01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:07.840]   Let me bring this up, see how they feel about it, like a very open minded sort of way.
[01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:11.040]   So you just start transforming existing relationships that way.
[01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:16.000]   And you also set out as you meet people at work and hobbies at your kids school, wherever
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:17.120]   it is that you're meeting people.
[01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:22.160]   Seek out some people who aren't just like you and do the effort of like, I want to try
[01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:24.160]   to bring this person into my friend group.
[01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:26.240]   Let me talk with them and find some common interest.
[01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:29.040]   So you want to try to make your the groups of people you trust.
[01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:32.000]   More diverse than all the different types of.
[01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:38.320]   Spectrums, you might measure that the way they think about things, their ethnic background,
[01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:42.320]   the type of jobs they have, the gender, everything right.
[01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:46.720]   And then just start cultivating those relationships like it's not weird if I send you an article,
[01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:51.760]   take a look at or we we get into a dorm room style about political issues.
[01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:54.480]   And I do it with an open heart, so it's not going to annoy you.
[01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:57.600]   But the key is you're getting feedback from an interesting group of people that you trust
[01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:00.720]   way more effective than Twitter.
[01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:02.480]   You'll also end up such an interesting person.
[01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:05.680]   So that's why I suggest and just stop getting feedback from Twitter.
[01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:08.000]   Stop getting feedback from TikTok or Facebook or whatever.
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.640]   You'll be a lot less stressed out and your your your points of view are going to be a
[01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:11.360]   lot more interesting.
[01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:17.040]   All right, so my vague memory is this guy had a follow up question, right?
[01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:17.920]   Yes.
[01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:19.120]   Yep.
[01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:20.160]   It was something controversial.
[01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:20.640]   What's the.
[01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:27.760]   So he's very curious if you think the crazy professor phenomenon happened to Jordan
[01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:29.600]   Peterson and Brett Weinstein.
[01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:30.080]   That's right.
[01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:30.560]   That's right.
[01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:30.800]   All right.
[01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:35.360]   So there's no way I'm going to get in trouble talking about this topic right now.
[01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:35.920]   You'll be fine.
[01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:41.840]   So first of all, I I forgot that I had called this phenomenon crazy professor phenomenon.
[01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:44.880]   I don't know if that's a fair name, but for people who didn't hear me talk about that before,
[01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:52.400]   it was the idea that if you people like really smart people in academia, when they leave academia.
[01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:59.440]   Are more prone than the average person to end up in more eccentric or conspiratorial or like
[01:28:59.440 --> 01:29:02.160]   way out of the mainstream type of views.
[01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:06.960]   And my argument was is because the fact you're an academic academia in the first place means
[01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:09.200]   that they typically have high octane minds.
[01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:12.960]   They're used to this idea that they're smarter than a lot of people and can figure things
[01:29:12.960 --> 01:29:14.080]   out that other people can't.
[01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:18.240]   But in academia, you have so many other minds pushing back on you.
[01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:19.840]   It's hard to get too weird.
[01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:24.160]   Right, because people you also respect and fear intellectually are going to be like,
[01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:25.440]   that's nonsense.
[01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:27.760]   I'm not going to put all my money in the gold, et cetera.
[01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:29.920]   When you leave academia, you lose that feedback buffer.
[01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:33.280]   And so you're much more likely to end up in weird places because you're intellectually
[01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:36.320]   confident and you're intellectually curious, but you don't have the dampers.
[01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:43.760]   So Jeffrey's asking, do I think that happened to Jordan Peterson or Brett Weinstein?
[01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:46.400]   I think it's Weinstein, right?
[01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:47.760]   Or Weinstein.
[01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:49.200]   I think it's Weinstein like Einstein.
[01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:50.400]   I'm not.
[01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:53.920]   If I'm getting that wrong, Brett, big apologies.
[01:29:53.920 --> 01:29:58.320]   So in his case, I think some of that might have happened.
[01:29:58.320 --> 01:30:06.800]   So if people don't know, Brett and his wife, Heather Herring, I believe, they were in academia.
[01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:10.960]   They were biologists, did a lot of stuff on evolutionary theory.
[01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:16.880]   They're at Evergreen University, which is, I think, a state university, a public university
[01:30:16.880 --> 01:30:18.960]   in Oregon or Washington state.
[01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:24.080]   It's very progressive, has these very progressive educational models where you don't quite get
[01:30:24.080 --> 01:30:24.640]   how it works.
[01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:28.560]   The classes are done in a really interesting, kind of unusual way.
[01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:32.720]   And they got into some sort of cancellation issue there.
[01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:38.000]   And it really got out of control where students were roaming the campus looking for them and
[01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:39.840]   maybe even physically threatening them.
[01:30:39.840 --> 01:30:42.880]   Long story short, they had to leave.
[01:30:42.880 --> 01:30:43.840]   They left academia.
[01:30:43.840 --> 01:30:45.920]   And so I think it's a mixed bag.
[01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:47.120]   Again, I don't know a ton about them.
[01:30:47.120 --> 01:30:52.800]   I know they have a new book out that sort of seems completely mainstream.
[01:30:52.800 --> 01:30:57.120]   And it has to do about what you can learn from evolutionary theory and the history of
[01:30:57.120 --> 01:31:00.560]   our species about modern life, like sort of down the middle.
[01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:08.800]   But I do think Brett went to some weird places with COVID during the pandemic that felt a
[01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:10.000]   little bit like this phenomenon.
[01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:13.360]   When I'd sample in a show here and there, where there's just like a lot of confidence
[01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:17.680]   on something that was very much out of the mainstream and did not in the end turn out
[01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:20.080]   to be at all really kind of right.
[01:31:20.080 --> 01:31:24.800]   There was a lot of this sort of confident out of the mainstream, a couple of places
[01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:25.440]   like that he felt.
[01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:29.680]   So I think that's probably a great example of that effect in action is because it's this
[01:31:29.680 --> 01:31:32.000]   very smart guy and Heather's very smart.
[01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:36.400]   And so it completely makes sense in their minds that we can kind of see something that's
[01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:38.560]   not widely recognized now.
[01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:39.840]   So maybe that's an example of it.
[01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:43.280]   Jordan Peterson, I think it's a much harder case.
[01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:46.800]   It's much harder to assess here.
[01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:52.960]   So like Peterson had been on my radar for a long time before he became a big public
[01:31:52.960 --> 01:31:53.360]   figure.
[01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:58.320]   Because again, when I would do student advice, I would occasionally hear from students who
[01:31:58.320 --> 01:31:59.440]   would talk about Dr.
[01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:04.960]   Peterson, especially students who were like first generation college students, students
[01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:10.240]   of color found a lot out of a lot good in his work.
[01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:13.200]   He's like a mentor like figure for a lot, a lot of people.
[01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:14.880]   And so it was kind of on my radar.
[01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:16.160]   He's a weird character.
[01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:19.120]   Like the thing to understand about Jordan Peterson that I think not a lot of people
[01:32:19.120 --> 01:32:23.920]   in just the non academic world understand is that he's an unusual character.
[01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:29.440]   He came out of what was like essentially the Canadian version of like West Texas, right?
[01:32:29.440 --> 01:32:37.280]   The sort of ranch country in the middle of Canada, a very cold kind of rough place comes
[01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:38.080]   out of there.
[01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:44.080]   So with no really a leader academic background and is like an incandescent star with an
[01:32:44.080 --> 01:32:44.720]   academia.
[01:32:44.720 --> 01:32:50.000]   I mean, he goes, he ends up at Harvard as a young professor where he's tenured in the
[01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:51.200]   psychology department.
[01:32:51.200 --> 01:32:54.000]   Harvard does not tenure from within very often in psychology.
[01:32:54.000 --> 01:33:00.400]   I mean, it was like a, this guy was seen as this bright star, you Toronto bottom away,
[01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:00.640]   right?
[01:33:00.640 --> 01:33:03.600]   Like, come, we're going to make you an offer you can't refuse.
[01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:09.360]   So he was like a superstar academic who had came out of nowhere, like not at all of an
[01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:12.800]   environment where you would expect to have a mind like that.
[01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:15.360]   So he was sort of this, I think that's often missed.
[01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:18.480]   I think for those who dislike him, it's more comfortable.
[01:33:18.480 --> 01:33:20.800]   This idea that he's sort of like a grifter type guy.
[01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:22.400]   That's just sort of like spouting off wisdom.
[01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:25.360]   And, you know, like obviously me as a reporter, much smarter than this guy.
[01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:28.960]   Now he was an incandescent star, like sort of out of the ranches of Canada.
[01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:34.160]   But from what I understand, it's hard to talk about this phenomenon with him because he
[01:33:34.160 --> 01:33:39.200]   always was sort of a loner and a little bit eccentric, even when he was in academia.
[01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:44.880]   I think because of this unusual background, he came, got out of, and this is secondhand,
[01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:51.520]   but, but I think he was again, already didn't really care about what the feedback was from
[01:33:51.520 --> 01:33:52.800]   colleagues or whatever.
[01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:55.120]   I don't know if that's true, but I've heard some things like that.
[01:33:55.120 --> 01:33:59.120]   So it's hard to say, you know, when he left academia and then, then of course you have
[01:33:59.120 --> 01:34:05.600]   this other confusing factor, confounding factor of the huge celebrity and the huge detraction
[01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:10.720]   that occurred when he became a public figure, the warping effect of that on someone has to
[01:34:10.720 --> 01:34:14.720]   be so powerful that it's going to swamp out any signal we're going to get about just,
[01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:21.840]   well, when he left academia, he may be without this type of cognitive structure and feedback,
[01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:24.400]   maybe got a little bit more eccentric.
[01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:34.320]   How can we separate that signal from the crushing, completely unbearable, completely unusual
[01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:36.080]   worldwide phenomenon and attacks?
[01:34:36.080 --> 01:34:42.560]   I mean, that had to have such a bigger impact on his life, his mental life than the changing
[01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:46.160]   his context of being academia or not that, that, that must swamp out that signal.
[01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:51.360]   So because of those two confounding factors, I can't tell what change leaving academia
[01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:52.000]   had on Peterson.
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:55.760]   So again, the summarize, he already was really iconoclastic and eccentric when he was in
[01:34:55.760 --> 01:34:56.560]   academia.
[01:34:56.560 --> 01:35:01.600]   And two, there's too many other things happened to him right when he left the, I can't pull
[01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:01.920]   apart.
[01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:03.760]   I can't pull apart those pieces.
[01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:06.320]   So there you go.
[01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:08.160]   Though I don't like crazy professor phenomenon.
[01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:08.960]   I don't think that's a good title.
[01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:11.200]   I should, I didn't realize I called it that before.
[01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:16.400]   I'll come with a better title, but again, it's very consistent though.
[01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:22.320]   Academics who leave academia, they usually have a lot of medical breakthroughs.
[01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:24.240]   They get become masters of finances.
[01:35:24.240 --> 01:35:27.040]   Like I can understand the financial system.
[01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:32.720]   And to get, and I don't want to go off on this, but like also like media criticism becomes
[01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:36.400]   a big thing because again, if you're like Brett Weinstein, you're a really smart guy
[01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:38.800]   and you get kind of resentful against some reporters.
[01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:41.680]   You're like, I'm just smarter than you and you annoy me.
[01:35:41.680 --> 01:35:45.680]   And like, then you get really angry at the media and it's a, it's a whole interesting
[01:35:45.680 --> 01:35:45.920]   thing.
[01:35:45.920 --> 01:35:51.120]   So if I ever left Georgetown, Jesse, you'd have to stop me from becoming like very conspiratorial
[01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:57.760]   and offering a lot of medical advice and financial advice and just attacking the media all the
[01:35:57.760 --> 01:35:58.000]   time.
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.800]   Though we'd probably get more subscribers.
[01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:04.400]   So, all right, that's enough of that.
[01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:05.600]   We should wrap up this show.
