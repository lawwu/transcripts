[00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.480]   Tax season is here, and if you're like most people, you probably just want to get it over with.
[00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.100]   But I want to show you how to actually get value out of it.
[00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.720]   So today, I'll quickly walk through why paying taxes with a credit card can be an incredible way
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.100]   to rack up points or even make money.
[00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.660]   Then I want to run through a ton of actionable hacks from the past few weeks,
[00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.160]   from teaching my kids to make serious money reselling gift cards and using card-linked offers,
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.760]   to a massive sign-up bonus, to stacking deals to get up to 30% off a Peloton,
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.880]   to sharing how changing the currency or location on your browser can actually save you a ton.
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.460]   And finally, given the current market climate, I want to go deep on how I'm thinking about investing right now
[00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.540]   after we've all seen the S&P 500 drop 10% in two days.
[00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.380]   This episode's a little bit of an experiment in last-minute production,
[00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.240]   but it is also packed with a ton of tactics and practical takeaways.
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.160]   So if you enjoy it, please share it with a friend or leave a comment or review.

[00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.840]   First, I want to talk about taxes, which I know is really timely,
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.780]   but specifically paying your taxes by credit card,
[00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.860]   because I think it's a really interesting opportunity.
[00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.460]   And given that taxes are due in a few days, I thought it would be great to get this out quickly.
[00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.220]   Apologies for the voice.
[00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.220]   I'm a little hoarse, maybe getting sick, but didn't have time to wait,
[00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.440]   because I know this is happening soon and some things have changed.
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.120]   So first off, taxes are not necessarily due.
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:30.460]   You can file an extension, but your payments are due by April 15 or whatever day that gets
[00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.680]   slightly adjusted to every year based on the calendar and weekends.
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.200]   However, just to be clear, there are some safe harbor rules,
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.340]   so you can avoid paying penalties by paying at least 90% of what you owe this year
[00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.420]   or 100% of what you owed the prior year.
[00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.740]   So keep that in mind.
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.580]   Make sure you make your payments on time.
[00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.180]   But I wanted to talk about making payments by credit card,
[00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.820]   because I think it's a really great opportunity.
[00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.920]   Now, this is a little bit of a different kind of episode.
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.960]   It is much more off the cuff.
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.960]   In fact, I came up with the idea to put it out a few hours ago.
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.900]   I'm recording it just a few days before it comes out.
[00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.180]   Would love feedback on what this kind of off the cuff,
[00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.820]   little bit of a grab bag episode as we progress.
[00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:12.740]   What do you think?
[00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.820]   Feel free to send me an email, a DM on social or anything like that.
[00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.060]   First off, why would you want to pay your taxes by credit card?
[00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.120]   Because it is not free.
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.000]   There are fees.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.860]   And the way I think about it is there's really only one reason,
[00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.580]   and that's that you're getting a positive ROI.
[00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:32.600]   Now, those fees range from as low as 1.75% all the way up to around 3%.
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:39.860]   We'll talk about that a little more, which means you need to be using a credit card that earns more than that for it to make sense.
[00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:49.000]   And I would argue a lot more than that, or at least a decent amount more than that, unless you're just interested in buying points.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.360]   Now, that might be a thing you are interested in.
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.080]   There's no easy way to buy transferable points from most of the different banks out there.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:08.540]   So, this could be an opportunity to buy some transferable points, but I think the really interesting opportunity is when you can use this to kind of earn more value than what you're paying.
[00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.000]   And that could even be a spread on cash back.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:20.580]   Or if there's a signup bonus you're interested in, but it requires a high amount of minimum spend, but the ROI on that signup bonus is really high, this could be an opportunity to do that.
[00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.760]   So, let's talk a little bit about the mechanics.
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.260]   So, there are two providers right now that are directly easy to make credit card payments.
[00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.900]   I'll talk about a few other options, Pay1040 and ACI.
[00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:39.000]   Pay1040 is 1.75% for consumer and small business cards, 2.89% for commercial credit and debit.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.820]   Then ACI is 1.85 and 2.95.
[00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:50.320]   So, in general, I would always be using Pay1040 unless you need to make more payments than you can make through Pay1040.
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:04:06.220]   And one thing is if you're noticing you are using a business card and it's showing up as 2.89%, double check if you use PayPal as the form of payment, if you can get that payment fee to show up as 1.75 or 1.85%.
[00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.040]   I think that's a good wrapper if you want to avoid the higher fee.
[00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:19.840]   So, if we're going to use the barrier as 1.75%, you can see a lot of circumstances where paying a credit card could make a lot of sense or even be profitable, right?
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.180]   If you had a 2% cashback card, it would be profitable.
[00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.800]   If you had a 2X points card where you get at least one cent of value, you could see that being better.
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:36.280]   If you have a card that earns even more than that, if you had the US Bank Smartly card earning 4%, or if you had a card earning a signup bonus where you were going to get 100,000 points,
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.880]   obviously those cases all make sense as well.
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.540]   So, first, make sure you know that you're going to get more value than this.
[00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.920]   Then, consider whether it makes sense.
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.760]   Now, these fees that I just mentioned are all for federal payments.
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.120]   Each state has their own rates and fees, so take a look into that specifically.
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:05:00.120]   As for how many payments you can make, technically, you're only supposed to be able to make two payments per tax period per type of payment.
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.620]   Meaning, if you have quarterly estimates and annual taxes, you could make two payments for each of those.
[00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:12.000]   From my experience and a lot of other people's experiences, that limit is actually set up on a per processor level,
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.280]   and the IRS doesn't seem to have a problem with you making two payments with Pay1040, two payments with ACI.
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.880]   You can also make payments in each person's name if you're filing jointly.
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.560]   They don't always get combined, and you may need to call the IRS to get them combined,
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.240]   but that is another option if you wanted to double the number of payments you want.
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.140]   Finally, if you want to make even more payments, there are services like Plastique and Melio,
[00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:39.400]   which I'll link to in the show notes, that have much higher fees, closer to 3%,
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.660]   but they would allow you to make more payments.
[00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:47.260]   And potentially, there might be some taxes that you can't make payments through the two main providers
[00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:48.940]   that those would allow you to make.
[00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.860]   Now, personal tax payment fees, those credit card fees, are not deductions,
[00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.020]   but if you are making business tax payments, they are.
[00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.220]   So especially if you owe any business-related taxes,
[00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.440]   the fact that the credit card fee is a deductible business expense makes this
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.640]   even a better deal for businesses.
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:11.060]   Now, if you want to go check all these payments you've made and make sure they show up,
[00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:12.400]   you can log into your tax account.
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.200]   You should be able to see all your payment histories.
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:19.120]   Another interesting thing, I can't promise the timeline by which this happens,
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:24.940]   but the IRS does say that overpayments will be refunded unless you owe a debt on your account.
[00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:30.280]   So I have heard people making payments beyond what they owe,
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:33.220]   and waiting and filing and getting a refund.
[00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:38.580]   But I have also heard of people, myself included, who have waited many months sometimes for those refunds.
[00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.020]   So definitely keep that in mind.
[00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.800]   Make sure you have a plan to pay off that credit card
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:47.200]   before you're expecting a refund to come in time for that bill to be due.
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:52.460]   So in general, this is a great opportunity, I think, for sign-up bonuses.
[00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:58.420]   Looking at a card, if you search around online, there are some cards that will even give you virtual card numbers,
[00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:59.880]   so you can use them right away.
[00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:06.680]   I've used almost all the tax payments we make at a minimum as an opportunity to make a small spread.
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:11.140]   I've talked recently about how we have a few different Bank of America cards.
[00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:18.280]   We've done the Platinum Honors track, which allows most of those cards to earn 2.625%.
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:25.740]   So at a minimum, if I'm going to owe the IRS money, I could take the 2.625%, subtract the 1.75% fee,
[00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:30.100]   and I'm making about 0.875% spread.
[00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.220]   Now, if you owe the IRS $500, it might not be worth your time.
[00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:38.780]   If you owe the IRS $100,000, and you have the credit limit across a few cards to support that,
[00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:45.000]   or you can pay it off over a few months when you're able to pay that card off and then make separate payments,
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.340]   could be really interesting.
[00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:47.820]   So keep that in mind.
[00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:53.820]   Wanted to share this with everyone quickly because I think people often overlook the opportunity this presents
[00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:58.080]   to accelerate earnings on bonuses or even just earn some points,
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:05.220]   especially if you have an interesting card that earns 2 points per dollar on everything like the Capital One Venture or VentureX cards.
[00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:13.420]   Now, to highlight an example of how great an opportunity a sign-up bonus could be relative to the fees for paying your taxes,
[00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:18.600]   I'm going to talk about a sign-up bonus that just came out this week, in fact, two days ago,
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:24.420]   for one of my favorite travel cards of 100,000 points after spending $5,000 in three months.
[00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:27.120]   And this is a card that earns transferable points.
[00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:30.680]   If you go to allthehacks.com slash cards, you'll see it at the top of the list.
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:31.960]   I'll link to it in the show notes.
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:38.020]   But think about the cost to put that $5,000 spend, even if you didn't have it,
[00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:43.040]   would be about $87.50 if you were paying 1.75% in fees.
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:46.860]   So you might think, okay, well, if I'm just earning one point per dollar,
[00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:51.460]   maybe that's not worth it because those points might only be worth $50 or $60.
[00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:53.600]   I'm going to pay $87 in fees.
[00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:58.020]   However, because there's a 100,000 point sign-up bonus, this looks very, very different.
[00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:02.280]   So worst case, I think you could use that sign-up bonus in the travel portal.
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:06.500]   And this card makes those travel redemptions worth 1.25 cents.
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:10.500]   And so 1.25 cents times 100,000 points is $1,250.
[00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:18.100]   So if you're getting $1,250 to spend $5,000, that's a 25% effective cashback rate.
[00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:24.120]   Now, would I want to take a 25% effective cashback rate at a cost of 1.75%?
[00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:24.740]   Absolutely.
[00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:28.580]   Now, if you can naturally spend that $5,000 in three months,
[00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:31.720]   you might not even need to do taxes to take advantage of this bonus.
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:35.020]   And that's probably one of the reasons that this 100,000 point sign-up bonus,
[00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:38.960]   at least in the points and miles world, is a bonus people have been waiting for
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.080]   because it's one of the best.
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.660]   You can transfer those points lots of places,
[00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:46.260]   which I think highlights how much better that bonus could be.
[00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:49.980]   So for example, I've used these points to go to Hyatt.
[00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:52.100]   I've used these points to go to different airlines,
[00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:56.160]   where the end value ends up not being 1.25 cents per point,
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.920]   but 2 cents per point or more,
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:01.500]   which would make 100,000 points worth $2,000 or more.
[00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:06.200]   So if you're going to earn back $2,000 of value for spending $5,000,
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.480]   that's a 40% return.
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:12.700]   And so I would challenge anyone who's eligible for this bonus,
[00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:15.920]   which does require not having the card currently,
[00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:16.980]   though if you have it,
[00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:22.360]   you can downgrade it to another no annual fee version of a card at this bank.
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.620]   And you can't have gotten this bonus in the last four years.
[00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:28.260]   But the card has a reasonable $95 annual fee,
[00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:33.880]   a $50 credit that you can use for travel stays to offset that.
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.280]   I think it's a really great opportunity if you're eligible
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:38.540]   and you're interested in more points.
[00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:42.460]   There's a link in the show notes to a post about the card and the offer.
[00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:44.260]   It's at the top of the best cards page.
[00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:46.840]   And as I always say, using those links on our site,
[00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.240]   it's a great way to support us.
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.120]   Thank you in advance.
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:53.180]   But if you find a deal elsewhere, always, anytime you're on our site,
[00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:54.840]   make sure you find the best deal.
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.020]   We try to put the best deals, but if they're not there,
[00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:58.100]   go get the best deal.
[00:10:58.100 --> 00:10:59.820]   You definitely won't hurt my feelings.
[00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:00.980]   In the case of this card,
[00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:02.920]   I don't think there's a better offer anywhere else.
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:06.280]   But I just want to flag that if there is a great offer on our site,
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:07.580]   it means a lot when you use it.
[00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:08.420]   Thank you so much.
[00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:10.600]   This episode is brought to you by FACET.
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:14.380]   Finding good and actionable financial advice is not easy,
[00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:18.160]   especially if you want it to come from someone who's acting in your best interest.
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:22.860]   So let me save you some time because when I shut down my financial planning firm a few years ago,
[00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:26.140]   we did a ton of research on who to recommend to our clients,
[00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:27.660]   and we landed on FACET.
[00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:31.460]   FACET makes professional financial advice actionable to everyone,
[00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:34.300]   and instead of charging a high percentage of your assets,
[00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:39.200]   they only charge a flat annual membership fee with investment management included.
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:43.840]   With FACET, you'll get access to a team of CFP professionals and specialists,
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:48.820]   providing guidance across retirement planning, tax strategy, estate planning, and more.
[00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:54.020]   So head on over to chrishutchins.com slash FACET, F-A-C-E-T,
[00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:57.540]   to learn more about which membership option is best for you.
[00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:00.300]   That's chrishutchins.com slash FACET.
[00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:02.280]   This episode is brought to you by Viori,
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:06.780]   which is amazing because they are one of only the few brands I wear almost every single day.
[00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:09.300]   I've got a shirt on, I've got the core shorts on.
[00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:13.600]   I love Viori, and I love that they bring a new perspective on performance apparel.
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:16.940]   It's so versatile, it can be used for just about any activity,
[00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:20.300]   whether it's running, training, swimming, yoga, or even lounging,
[00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:22.420]   or running errands, or going out to dinner.
[00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:25.820]   Seriously, I wear my Meta Pants out for dinner all the time.
[00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:29.560]   But today, I want to talk about their Dream Knit collection because it's amazing.
[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:32.580]   It is super soft, lightweight, moisture wicking,
[00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:37.520]   but also has this amazing four-way performance stretch that makes it so comfortable.
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:41.500]   While it's almost impossible to narrow my Viori recommendations down to just one thing,
[00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:45.820]   I want you to check out the Ponto Performance Jogger for men or the Performance Jogger for women.
[00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:50.160]   I know me and my wife, Amy, absolutely love them and wear them all the time.
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.740]   Seriously, I think Viori is an investment in your happiness.
[00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:56.560]   And for everyone watching, they're offering 20% off your first purchase,
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:01.120]   plus free shipping on U.S. orders over $75 and free returns.
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:05.040]   So get yourself some of the most comfortable and versatile clothing on the planet
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:07.600]   at chrishutchins.com slash Viori.
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.420]   That's V-U-O-R-I.
[00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:15.160]   Again, that's chrishutchins.com slash Viori to discover the versatility of Viori clothing.
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:16.420]   Exclusions apply.
[00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:20.520]   Visit the website for full terms and conditions and find the link in the description.
[00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:25.880]   So next, I want to jump into a bunch of great travel and savings hacks that I've come across
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:28.620]   recently that I really think you all could benefit from.
[00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:31.920]   There are some referral links or discounts that I'll mention.
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:33.260]   I'll put them all in the show notes.
[00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.520]   Some of the times those benefit me because they're my referral link.
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:40.640]   In a few cases, I found a better deal than my referral link and I'll share that instead.
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:43.800]   That said, none of those brands have paid for me to talk about them.
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.220]   So I just want to be really clear on what is and isn't an ad.
[00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:50.820]   If you do hear an ad in this episode, which you will, it always starts with this episode
[00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:51.840]   is brought to you by.
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:53.080]   Those are our sponsors.
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:58.100]   For what it's worth, almost all of those sponsors are brands that I love and most of those relationships
[00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:02.120]   came from me reaching out to them after I wanted to work with those products and services
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:03.140]   because I loved them.
[00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:08.140]   But those are the ads and those are very different from if I want to share a product or service
[00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:11.780]   I love and include a promo code I found online or my referral link.
[00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:14.020]   That's just purely me sharing the things I love.
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:20.120]   So first off, we recently came back from a trip to Colorado and just a few things happened
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.020]   that I thought were interesting.
[00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:26.180]   One, I've started using the Flighty app almost exclusively as the way I manage all of my travel
[00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:27.400]   plans with flights.
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:33.580]   And the coolest thing happened because Flighty is monitoring all the inbound aircraft and everything.
[00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:40.460]   I got an alert one hour before departure that they estimated that my departure would be pushed
[00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:47.440]   back by 15 or 20 minutes and it took a full 40 minutes before the airline actually pushed
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:51.760]   back the departure to the exact time that Flighty was estimating they would.
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:56.140]   Now, it's no surprise that with all the data they have, they've probably learned,
[00:14:56.140 --> 00:15:02.140]   hmm, when inbound aircrafts on this airline are delayed by this much at this airport, it results
[00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:04.160]   in a delayed departure time of this.
[00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:07.380]   So, loved being able to get that notification early.
[00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:11.220]   Now, obviously, if your flight is delayed or you think there's an estimated delay,
[00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:15.780]   that doesn't give you free reign to show up at the gate when that new departure time is announced
[00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:17.660]   because airlines can pull those up.
[00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:22.280]   So, I would always keep an eye on maybe the airline app or if you're near the gate,
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.900]   just double check that the flight's not leaving early.
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:28.680]   Obviously, if you're keeping an eye on where the plane is and the plane hasn't even landed,
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:30.060]   you're pretty safe.
[00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:36.680]   But just want to say don't 100% rely on any app telling you you've got an extra 30 minutes
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:38.120]   unless you're really, really confident.
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:43.960]   Second, we were in the Denver airport and we used this lounge that United opened called the
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:44.880]   Club Fly Lounge.
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:46.280]   And it's not really a lounge.
[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:48.740]   There wasn't really more than a couple places to sit.
[00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:55.060]   It was more of a grab and go with a barista making coffees and matchas and whatnot and
[00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:57.460]   then fridges and snack counters.
[00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:03.440]   And it was just such a great experience, especially with two young kids, to be able to walk in,
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:07.440]   grab a handful of snacks, not feeling like I was not supposed to do it.
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.120]   You know, if you've gone into an airport lounge, you're like,
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:10.160]   Oh, here's some extra fruit.
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.520]   Let's hide it in my jacket.
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:13.000]   You know, let's put it in a purse.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.700]   In this case, that was exactly what it was designed for.
[00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:18.600]   We walked in, we stocked up on snacks, we walked out.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.280]   We had those snacks on the plane.
[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:21.340]   Kids had food to eat.
[00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:22.020]   It was great.
[00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:24.500]   I really would love to see more lounges doing that.
[00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:27.520]   I think Delta is experimenting with one of those lounges somewhere.
[00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:29.020]   And I know United has a few.
[00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:30.620]   Can't wait to see more of those.
[00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:34.780]   And then last, we thought we were going to go to the Capital One Lounge, but we didn't have time.
[00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:37.800]   But I noticed in the app that there was a really long waitlist.
[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:40.240]   And you can join that waitlist in advance.
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:43.260]   So if you're flying anywhere and there's a Capital One Lounge and you want to join,
[00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:46.120]   you could join that waitlist as soon as you're on the ground.
[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:50.100]   You could probably even join it from the air based on how long you think it'll be till
[00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:50.600]   you can go.
[00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:52.140]   And then they give you 10 minutes to enter.
[00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:53.760]   So just something to keep in mind there.
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:17:00.440]   Next, I want to talk about Amex Member Week, which was super underwhelming with one exception.
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:04.940]   And it was a great opportunity to make a little bit of money and teach my kids a lesson.
[00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:10.880]   And I thought it'd be fun to give a really concrete example on how some of these card-linked offers
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:11.840]   can add a ton of value.
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:18.340]   So the specific offer at hand was a $50 off $200 offer at Lowe's.
[00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:21.000]   Now, we're not in the middle of a renovation.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.580]   We're not doing a lot of projects.
[00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:26.120]   Saving $50 at Lowe's was not something I needed.
[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:29.600]   And so normally, I would just completely ignore the offer.
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:33.700]   But Lowe's does offer the ability to buy gift cards.
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:39.580]   So I thought about the ROI, and it didn't end up being high enough that it was worth
[00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:42.240]   my time to necessarily leave work and go do this.
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:47.360]   But I was talking to my kids, and I was thinking, well, do you guys want to go to the park right
[00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:49.980]   now and let off some steam there?
[00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:53.960]   Or do you want to go on an adventure where we can make money, and then you guys can decide
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:54.660]   what to do with it?
[00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:59.020]   So I'll walk you through the deal and how it was a really great opportunity for them.
[00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:06.120]   So buying $200 worth of gift cards, for us, a lot of the best value gift cards were already
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:06.680]   sold out.
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:08.280]   I think other people got the same memo.
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:14.360]   So we ended up buying $200 Dick's Sporting Good gift cards, and we got $50 off.
[00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:17.080]   So out the gate, you're getting 25% back.
[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:20.120]   Now, we couldn't resell those gift cards at face value.
[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:26.180]   So the $200 Dick's Sporting Good gift cards, we were able to sell for $0.88 on the dollar
[00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:27.220]   for $176.
[00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:28.980]   We took a 12% loss.
[00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:33.680]   And then because you can't choose which credit card you use, right?
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:36.100]   You have to use the card that is linked to the offer.
[00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:39.000]   The points we earned on that was only about 1.5%.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:45.780]   So if you take 25% gain plus 1.5% gain from the points minus 12% on the loss, we had about
[00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:51.380]   a 14% profit doing this, which meant that if we were spending $200, we were making $28.
[00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:58.400]   Except because I use the Card Pointers extension, because I have Card Pointers Pro, which I'll put
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:00.620]   a link to in the show notes if you want 30% off.
[00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:04.380]   You can activate offers on multiple cards at once.
[00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:08.460]   And that's important because if you logged into your portal for your Amex account and you
[00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:11.780]   activated it on one card, you wouldn't have it on the other card.
[00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:15.620]   So you might see that you have the offer, but when you go to add it, it usually only adds
[00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:16.000]   to one.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.580]   But if you manage to hit Amex's servers at the exact same time for all your cards, which is
[00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:25.380]   what the Card Pointers extension does, then you would have that offer multiple times.
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:30.960]   So we had that offer six times, so we ended up with $168 of profit from a trip to Lowe's.
[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:35.040]   Now, do you want to take time out of your day to drive to Lowe's for $168?
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:38.360]   That is a very personal question and how you value your time.
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:40.920]   And I could argue that on some days, yes.
[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:42.120]   And on some days, maybe no.
[00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:46.840]   But do I want to take my kids on an adventure that allows them to own the process, understand
[00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:52.200]   how this works, and make $168, and then get to have a conversation about what to do with
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:52.380]   it?
[00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:53.040]   Absolutely.
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:56.400]   So we decided to take some of it and go buy ice cream.
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:20:00.960]   My kids were kind enough to agree that they were so happy with how much money they had.
[00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:04.060]   They bought mommy and daddy ice cream, which was a really fun experience.
[00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:08.860]   And then we took their bank account and we said, let's put some of it there and we'll save
[00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:09.560]   some for the future.
[00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:14.020]   And then we even took some of it and we decided to make a small donation.
[00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:18.000]   So we got to split it up and help them see the different ways they can use their money
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.380]   for different causes.
[00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:21.280]   It was a really great learning experience.
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:26.660]   But the high level is when you see these offers, definitely consider whether there are hidden
[00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:30.460]   opportunities within those offers beyond what you see at face value.
[00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:37.200]   And here's a great example of another one that was a surprising last minute purchase.
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:41.700]   So my wife and I have been thinking about getting a Peloton treadmill for a while.
[00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:42.500]   We've had a bike.
[00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:43.760]   We've really enjoyed it.
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:47.340]   We've used the app for runs and we've been running a lot more.
[00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:52.760]   And lately it's either been dark outside early in the morning or kids are napping so we can't
[00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:55.720]   go on a run around the neighborhood and we've wanted a Peloton treadmill.
[00:20:55.720 --> 00:21:01.220]   Now, we've been looking on Facebook Marketplace for a long time and Craigslist.
[00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:05.860]   And other than a bunch of scams that I've found, we have not been able to find one for
[00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:06.840]   a reasonable price.
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:09.380]   And mostly not an unreasonable price either.
[00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:11.000]   They just seem to be very hard to come by.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:17.660]   The retail price for a Peloton tread is $3,000 and we've seen them for maybe $2,600, $2,500,
[00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:19.540]   but nothing really less than that.
[00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:23.720]   Now, if you factor in the sales tax in California, that's an even better deal.
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:29.400]   But even those are quite a drive, hour, hour and a half away from where we are.
[00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:37.220]   And then I got this email that the Peloton partnership with one of the credit cards I have was extended
[00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:41.920]   and is going to continue offering 10x points on Peloton purchases.
[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:48.480]   So I thought, okay, well, those points when redeemed in the travel portal at a minimum are
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:49.720]   worth one and a half cents.
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:54.460]   Now, I usually get more value than that, but that means that the Peloton was 15% off.
[00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:59.400]   Now, that's not bad, but I was starting to think, is there any cashback portal options?
[00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:07.180]   So I went to cashback monitor and I looked and I noticed that Rakuten was currently doing 2%
[00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:07.580]   back.
[00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:11.180]   And if you link your Rakuten account to your Amex account, you can get 2x points.
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:14.420]   But that wasn't that exciting.
[00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:16.460]   I decided I wanted to wait for a better deal.
[00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:23.760]   And so I went into this app that I've recently found called SaveWise, which has a ton of features,
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:29.620]   some of which are overlapping with card pointers and some of which are overlapping with cashback
[00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:34.460]   monitor, which basically, they're a directory of all the different ways you can earn cashback,
[00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:38.280]   but they will also auto-activate some of the offers that are card-linked offers.
[00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:43.560]   But the really cool thing they do, and I'll put a link in the show notes to what I think
[00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:50.220]   is a discount on the pro version for SaveWise, is they set alerts on cashback so that you can
[00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:53.560]   get it alerted if Rakuten's offers go up.
[00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:56.000]   So for example, I looked at the history.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.540]   So another cool thing they do is they show the offer history.
[00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:01.240]   Pro account goes up to, I think, 9 months.
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:07.620]   And I noticed that Peloton has been as high as 6% back on Rakuten, which is 6x Amex points,
[00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:08.800]   which is pretty exciting.
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:13.900]   So I thought, okay, if it can get up to 6x again, that would probably be enough for me
[00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:14.460]   to pull the trigger.
[00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:21.720]   So we sat, we set up the alert, and then the next day, I got an alert that on Kudos, which
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:28.260]   is another cashback platform I've talked about before, you could get 12% back on Peloton.
[00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:34.100]   So now I'm thinking, wow, my card earning from the Peloton partnership is 15% off.
[00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:35.640]   Kudos is 12% off.
[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:37.160]   I think we should do this.
[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:40.000]   We had no intention that day of buying the Peloton Tread.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.200]   But at 27% off, it seemed like we had to go ahead and just do it.
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:47.260]   And so I start checking out.
[00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:48.760]   Everything's going fine.
[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:52.100]   And then I get to the final checkout screen on Peloton.
[00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:55.040]   And there were two things that made me think, could this get better?
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:56.620]   So there was a promo code field.
[00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:59.920]   And then there was a payment box that said, do you want to pay by gift cards?
[00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:04.800]   So naturally, my first step is go see if there's anywhere on the internet I can buy Peloton gift
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:05.520]   cards at a discount.
[00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:06.520]   There was not.
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:07.480]   I couldn't find them.
[00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:08.560]   But worth a try.
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:09.880]   Next was promo codes.
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:10.900]   I started searching around.
[00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:15.900]   And I knew that there was a Peloton referral code where you get $100 off.
[00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:18.760]   And if I give you that referral code, I would also get $100.
[00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:23.980]   So I thought about sharing that all with you, except the $100 you get is off accessories.
[00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:26.180]   And the $100 I get is off accessories.
[00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:27.780]   And I don't know.
[00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:28.840]   I don't need any more accessories.
[00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:33.180]   And then I found the World of Hyatt partnership with Peloton page.
[00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:38.840]   And there's a $100 discount that works on the bike, works on the tread, works on the row.
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:41.000]   And that seemed much more exciting.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.080]   So instead of sharing my referral code, I will share a link in the show notes to the Hyatt
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:51.000]   discount page where you can get $100 off, which depending on what you're buying, a bike would
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.980]   be equivalent of about 7%.
[00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:54.920]   The tread was about 3%.
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:25:01.100]   Now, all of a sudden, I was stacking my $100 off, my 10x points, which I valued at 15% off,
[00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:06.100]   my 12% off from kudos to get all the way to about 30% off.
[00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:11.480]   Now, I did the math on what we were going to end up paying with 30% off.
[00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:14.620]   And I'm not ready to do this for a living.
[00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:21.300]   But that final price is low enough, based on my experience monitoring Facebook Marketplace,
[00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:27.640]   monitoring Craigslist, that I am almost 100% certain, especially because all of the Peloton
[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:32.260]   treads I've seen out there, and this is probably true of bikes and bike pluses, are all usually
[00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:33.560]   one to two years used.
[00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:41.860]   If I were to market that I could sell your brand new, just opened, still under a one-year
[00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:46.320]   warranty Peloton for 30% off, I think I could make a business flipping Peloton.
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:52.100]   So if you have these offers and you can stack them and you want to, I bet you could make $300
[00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:54.040]   or $400 for every Peloton you flipped.
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:59.200]   Now, I think the points earning opportunity for 10x is capped at 50,000 points.
[00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:02.080]   So there is some ceiling to what you could do here.
[00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:07.800]   But I think that it's at least worth exploring if you want a little side hustle and you want
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:08.320]   a little fun.
[00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:10.640]   But it's even more worth exploring if you want a Peloton.
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:16.540]   So I'll put my links for SaveWise and Kudos and the World of Hyatt discount all in the show
[00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:16.780]   notes.
[00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:19.360]   I think the Kudos link is for $20 off.
[00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:23.440]   So I don't know what that would add, maybe 1% additional to all of this.
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:25.080]   But I thought that was kind of cool.
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:29.520]   And if you're in the market for a Peloton, hopefully this helps you push you over the edge
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:31.000]   to make it a little bit more affordable.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.180]   This episode is brought to you by Gelt.
[00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:37.500]   Now, when it comes to building wealth, taxes are such a big part of the strategy.
[00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:41.920]   And as tax time gets closer, getting prepared now is so important.
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:46.340]   And now that I'm working with Gelt, I finally feel like I have a partner I can trust to
[00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:49.020]   handle everything for my personal and business taxes.
[00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:51.740]   You can think of Gelt as the ultimate modern CPA.
[00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:56.480]   Of course, they have an in-house team of expert CPAs to work with who can help you determine
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:00.180]   the most effective tax strategies to minimize risk and grow your wealth.
[00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:05.420]   But they also have an amazing tech platform that gives you personalized guidance to maximize
[00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:07.580]   deductions, tax credits, and savings.
[00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:12.480]   Beyond that, the tax library you get access to as a client has dozens of in-depth guides
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:15.740]   on things like choosing retirement plans, taxes for parents,
[00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:19.020]   qualified business income, or QBI, and much more.
[00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:24.440]   So if you're ready for a more premium, proactive tax strategy to optimize and file your taxes,
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:26.220]   definitely check out Gelt.
[00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:29.680]   And as a viewer, you can skip the wait list.
[00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:33.420]   Just head to chrishutchins.com slash Gelt, G-E-L-T.
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:38.560]   Again, that's chrishutchins.com slash Gelt, or find the link in the description to stop
[00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:40.020]   overpaying on taxes.
[00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:42.240]   This episode is brought to you by Element.
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:47.840]   Now, I love Element, and I use it all the time because it helps anyone stay hydrated without
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:52.540]   the sugar and other dodgy ingredients in popular electrolyte and sports drinks.
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:57.640]   And that's important because electrolyte deficiency or imbalance can cause headaches, cramps, fatigue,
[00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:59.140]   brain fog, and weakness.
[00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:05.400]   In fact, Element is a zero-sugar electrolyte drink mix and sparkling electrolyte water born
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:09.920]   from the growing body of research revealing that optimal health outcomes occur at sodium
[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:12.300]   levels two to three times government recommendations.
[00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:17.780]   Element is formulated for anyone on a mission to restore their health through hydration and
[00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:23.100]   is perfectly suited for everyone from athletes to regular people like me and works if you're
[00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:25.920]   fasting on a keto, low-carb, or paleo diet.
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:30.860]   And if you're not sure if it's for you, don't worry because Element offers a no-questions-asked
[00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:33.620]   refund policy so you can try it totally risk-free.
[00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:39.400]   Get your free sample pack with any Element purchase at chrishutchins.com slash LMNT.
[00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:44.660]   This deal is only available through that link, so support the show and go to chrishutchins.com
[00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:48.500]   slash Element or click the link in the description and get hydrated.
[00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:49.800]   A couple other things that happen.
[00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:55.260]   One, I noticed there was a discount for the hiking app AllTrails, and so I put that in the
[00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:55.700]   newsletter.
[00:28:55.700 --> 00:29:00.580]   But as I was reading the comments on Doctor of Credit, I noticed that everyone in the comments
[00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:01.580]   said, this is a terrible deal.
[00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:03.940]   Yes, AllTrails might normally be $50.
[00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:05.820]   Yes, it's on sale for $20.
[00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:09.660]   But don't forget that their pricing is country-specific.
[00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:16.520]   So if you're currently traveling in India, you could get AllTrails for much less than $20.
[00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:18.080]   I think it was something like $5 or $6.
[00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:22.420]   And people are like, and also, did you know that you can use a VPN to see that?
[00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:28.440]   And it just got me thinking, I didn't actually do this on the Peloton, but should I be using
[00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:33.680]   a VPN to basically not just sometimes price shop flights, which I've done in the past, but
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:38.540]   also to go and price shop anything I'm buying to see if the price is better.
[00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:42.980]   And so that's something I'm going to add to my routine of all of the things I do before
[00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:45.500]   I'm shopping online because I thought it was pretty cool.
[00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:48.240]   And the VPN I use for all this is NordVPN.
[00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:49.980]   They have been a sponsor in the past.
[00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:50.840]   They aren't anymore.
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:55.340]   But I do think that they still have a discount that's pretty compelling.
[00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:59.620]   If you go to the link in the show notes, I think it's also on our deals page.
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:08.180]   And I ended up picking NordVPN after a very detailed, thorough read of a Reddit post where
[00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:14.820]   it seemed like every single VPN software was compared on 10s or 20 verticals of features.
[00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:16.900]   And I've been very happy using it.
[00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:19.680]   I don't think it's necessary for security.
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:24.360]   But I do love that if I were shopping for a flight within a region like Southeast Asia,
[00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:27.180]   I'd be able to use a VPN to mimic that.
[00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:31.200]   I also, there are a lot of times where credit card offers, especially with Amex, are kind
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:33.860]   of location or regionally specific.
[00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:35.440]   So I've used it for those purposes.
[00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:38.160]   So usually it's a deal seeking tool, not a security tool.
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:43.320]   But in a similar vein to getting different prices based on what country you're in, getting
[00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:47.160]   different prices based on what currency you pay for is something that I came across twice
[00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:47.620]   this week.
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:52.800]   So first on the Icon Pass, if you're looking for Ski Pass, they've gone on sale for next
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:53.120]   year.
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:55.960]   You know, we're more of an epic pass in terms of where we go.
[00:30:55.960 --> 00:31:00.080]   But the Icon Pass has a little drop down on the top of the page where you can choose to
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:02.160]   pay in US dollars or Canadian dollars.
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:08.520]   And so if you choose Canadian dollars, the price goes down, depending on exchange rates,
[00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:11.440]   anywhere from 100 to more than $100.
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:17.340]   And so easy way to save on the Icon Pass is use a card with no foreign transaction fees,
[00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:18.620]   buy it in Canadian dollars.
[00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:24.740]   Similarly, I was helping a friend buy a ticket on the Eurostar train between London and Paris.
[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:31.580]   And the price of that ticket was about 5% cheaper buying it in euros than buying it in
[00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:32.180]   US dollars.
[00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:37.540]   So reminder, anytime you're buying something that is offered in multiple currencies, double
[00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:40.460]   check that it's not much, much cheaper in that other currency.
[00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:46.180]   For example, anytime you're overseas with using Uber, there's actually an option in the Uber
[00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:52.020]   app that they recently defaulted to one that is not in your favor, where they default price
[00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:56.120]   everything in dollars and do a conversion rate for you that's less favorable.
[00:31:56.120 --> 00:32:00.680]   So you have to go in there and say, actually, always price in the local currency, and you
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:01.860]   will save money doing that.
[00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:04.660]   So definitely go into that Uber app and make that change.
[00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:09.700]   Unless you have a credit card that doesn't offer foreign transaction fees for free and charges
[00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:11.940]   you 3%, then it might not make sense.
[00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:17.660]   However, one thing to keep in mind is that as of recording this, which is April 4th, 2025,
[00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:21.280]   some of those currency rates are changing drastically.
[00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:26.440]   And I actually wonder if that Icon Pass discount has gone down even further than when I first
[00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:26.960]   checked it.
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:32.700]   Because as almost all of you will know, and who knows what happens in the next three or
[00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:38.480]   four days between recording this and it coming out, but the US stock market is quite a bit
[00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:41.680]   down, over 10% in the last two days.
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:46.340]   And I just thought I'd want to share a little bit about how I think about this situation.
[00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:49.300]   We talk about markets, we talk about investing, we talk about money.
[00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:55.240]   But usually timely things don't necessarily fit in because I'm recording this podcast days
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:57.460]   or weeks or sometimes even months in advance.
[00:32:57.460 --> 00:33:02.640]   But with this experiment right now, I'm recording it a couple days in advance.
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:07.960]   And I thought it could be a good opportunity to share how I think about situations like what's
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:09.420]   going on right now in the markets.
[00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:14.820]   not from a political standpoint, but from a financial standpoint and an investment standpoint.
[00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:20.240]   And the funny thing is, first off, I'm not really thinking about it a lot.
[00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:22.860]   Now, obviously, I don't like headlines of the market crashing.
[00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:25.240]   I'd rather the market be up 10% or 20%.
[00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:30.960]   However, one of the principles I adhere to is that all of the money that I have invested
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:35.740]   in the stock market is money that has at least a five-year horizon.
[00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:42.280]   So if I have money that I need for a down payment, a tuition payment, anything really that I'm
[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:49.560]   going to spend in the next five years, I keep that money in cash and not just 0% cash, but
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:54.920]   cash in a bank account or money market fund or treasuries that are earning hopefully over
[00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:55.100]   4%.
[00:33:55.100 --> 00:34:07.020]   And that means that unless the market doesn't recover over the next five years, it being
[00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:12.880]   down 10% right now or 20% or 30% or whatever that number ends up being doesn't have a huge
[00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:20.380]   impact on my life other than whatever emotional toll I let it take on me while it's happening.
[00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:26.480]   And if you look at the data on what happens in the stock market over a period of, you know,
[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:33.960]   one to 30 years, you see that the longer period you look at, the less likely a down trend in
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:34.680]   the market is.
[00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:39.500]   And so there's this great chart from Ben Carlson's blog, which I'm looking at right now, and I'll
[00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:42.480]   put up on the screen if you're watching on video or I'll link in the show notes.
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:49.780]   And it basically looks at returns for the S&P 500 from 1993 forward in a increment of
[00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:51.960]   everywhere from one to 31 years.
[00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:57.020]   And what you'll notice is that if you look one year forward, there's six years where the
[00:34:57.020 --> 00:34:57.860]   market was negative.
[00:34:57.860 --> 00:34:58.780]   That makes sense.
[00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:03.900]   And the further you go down, there's less and less number of years that are negative to
[00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:10.320]   the point that by the time you get to a 11-year horizon, there was not an 11-year window
[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:13.700]   starting from 1993 forward where the market was down.
[00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:20.020]   And if you go to five years, there was not a year looking five years out that the market
[00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:21.600]   was down more than 2%.
[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:26.600]   So this gives me a lot of comfort knowing that if I don't need this money for five plus years,
[00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:29.260]   there has not been a time in the past.
[00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:33.460]   Now, we could make all the speculation about whether now is different than the past, but
[00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:39.460]   there has not been a time, at least according to this chart, since 1993, where the market
[00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:43.020]   stayed down 10% over a five-year window.
[00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:45.980]   In fact, the same is true over four years.
[00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:47.020]   It didn't happen.
[00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:51.980]   You'd have to go to a three-year window to see a double-digit decline at any point in time
[00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:52.760]   since 1993.
[00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:58.620]   And once you get, like I said, to five years, it's pretty hard to find a decline lower than
[00:35:58.620 --> 00:35:59.240]   2%.
[00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:05.920]   So I just try to accept that that's what happened in history.
[00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:10.440]   That's probably, not certainly, but probably what's going to happen going forward.
[00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:15.840]   And so, yeah, it sucks and it burns to see the market down.
[00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:19.560]   But maybe on the flip side, it's a buying opportunity.
[00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:25.260]   Maybe any of the money that I have in cash that I also don't need for five years, maybe now would
[00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:26.820]   be a good time to put that money in the market.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.700]   I try not to keep too much cash on the sidelines, but every now and then, you know, it ends
[00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:32.200]   up happening.
[00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:38.500]   And honestly, right now is a time where over the next few months, I will probably take all
[00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:40.540]   the cash that we have that's not invested.
[00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:46.040]   Some of it because we managed to move 401ks from one provider to another.
[00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:51.280]   And as modern as society is, the only way we could do that was by mailing a check, which
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:53.740]   meant we had to sell all of our holdings, mail a check.
[00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:56.960]   They got deposited and they didn't get automatically invested.
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:37:02.300]   And I've been trying to figure out when to do that, mostly out of just finding the time
[00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:02.860]   to do it.
[00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:04.980]   Now seems like a pretty great time, right?
[00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:06.040]   Market's down 10%.
[00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:06.980]   Everything's on sale.
[00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:12.700]   Honestly, my only fear is that the market will go down even more and I will have missed an
[00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:14.220]   opportunity to buy even cheaper.
[00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:18.240]   And so the way I think about those things is I just try to come up with a plan.
[00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:24.660]   So right now, I'm thinking my plan is deploy a third of the cash I have now, a third of
[00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:26.780]   the cash I have in a month, and a third in two months.
[00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:31.360]   And the reason I don't put it all in at once is like I said, I don't want the market to correct
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:33.240]   even more and feel like I missed that opportunity.
[00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:39.760]   That said, if I were to put a third of the cash that I have in the market now, and the market
[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:45.520]   were to drop another 20%, I'd probably pull that timeline up and put the rest of it in at
[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:48.040]   20% down beyond what we're at today.
[00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:50.200]   And if it drops further, I could live with that.
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:54.600]   But I think it's important when you're thinking about these things to come up with a plan instead
[00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:58.480]   of just try to trust your gut each day because it'll always feel hard every day.
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:00.860]   Now, one thing I'm absolutely not doing is selling.
[00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:03.100]   Do I think the market could go down 20%?
[00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:05.100]   I think it's really possible.
[00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:06.140]   I don't know, right?
[00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:07.080]   Like I have no idea.
[00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:11.260]   If there's anything I know that's certain, it's that I don't know, but it's possible that
[00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:12.720]   it will go down another 20%.
[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:18.720]   Will I have benefited if I sold everything now, let the market drop 20% and put money
[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:19.200]   back in?
[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:20.020]   Absolutely.
[00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:25.700]   Do I think there's any chance at all that if I took my money out now and the market dropped
[00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:27.900]   20% that I would be able to time the bottom?
[00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:29.200]   Absolutely not.
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:35.500]   There would be nothing harder for me than to see the market down 30% and think this is the
[00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:37.360]   bottom with my entire portfolio.
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:38.480]   It would just be so hard.
[00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:43.100]   The whole theory of catching a falling knife is very hard, though I guess in reality, it'd
[00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:46.820]   probably be easier to catch the knife than it would be to time the bottom of the market.
[00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:53.980]   And deciding to rebuy is such a hard thing that I'm just like Nick Majuli said in the interview
[00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:57.200]   we had a couple of years ago, which I will link to in the show notes.
[00:38:58.160 --> 00:38:59.780]   It's just keep buying.
[00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:00.960]   And that's the strategy.
[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:04.340]   And so that's the strategy I have adhered to.
[00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:05.940]   It's worked well.
[00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:11.360]   From data standpoint, it's also worked well, not just for me, but for anyone who holds for
[00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:12.160]   a long horizon.
[00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:13.860]   Historically, it has worked well.
[00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:19.100]   One other thing that I'm thankful for right now is that I have done a little bit of diversification.
[00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:22.080]   Our portfolio is not entirely in the United States.
[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:27.420]   We have a few international index funds and the international markets are down less than
[00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:28.200]   the US markets.
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:32.960]   Now, over the last, I think, five or 10 years, that hasn't been the case.
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:39.600]   And I've honestly been wondering whether I should have had an even simpler portfolio of just 100%
[00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:41.580]   US total stock market, VTI.
[00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:48.320]   And when I talked with JL Collins last year, and we debated that specific topic on whether
[00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:53.220]   you need international exposure, I was almost convinced that it would make sense.
[00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:59.800]   But all the data, looking at correlations, looking at historical performance, would argue that the
[00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:05.840]   diversification of adding international two-year US exposure pushes you further out the efficient
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:08.420]   frontier and has better risk-adjusted returns.
[00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:10.180]   So I didn't make any changes.
[00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:14.300]   And the current situation is a great example that you never know what the future holds.
[00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:21.100]   And diversification can be really powerful, both in stocks, bonds, and cash, as well as
[00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:24.800]   US international or other asset classes like real estate.
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:30.460]   So one thing that I am considering right now, and that I think some people could, just like
[00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:35.740]   I did during the pandemic, is when the market's down a significant amount, it is a good time
[00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:37.200]   to consider tax loss harvesting.
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:42.760]   And the way that works is, if you sell a stock that you bought, and you sell it at a loss,
[00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:51.780]   you can take that loss and offset either other gains you have that year, or income up to $3,000.
[00:40:52.540 --> 00:41:06.920]   So if you have some losses in your portfolio right now, because I mean, I guess practically, if you made any purchase of most stocks or index funds in the last year, there's a pretty good chance that that current position is down.
[00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:25.700]   So if you were invested in the total stock market, VTI, Vanguard's index fund, and you sold that,
[00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:30.160]   you could buy something similar like Schwab's US Broad Market Index Fund.
[00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:34.040]   And you'd maintain your exposure to that same asset class.
[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:42.560]   But you would be able to capture those losses and use them this year to offset other capital gains or up to $3,000 of income.
[00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:50.300]   So if you live in California, offsetting income tax, depending on your tax bracket, or probably true of New York and many other states, could be really meaningful.
[00:41:50.300 --> 00:42:01.220]   And certainly would be better than the 20% capital gains you'd pay if you were to hold that for a lot longer and pay capital gains tax.
[00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:05.560]   So offsetting income is really interesting, though limited to $3,000 a year.
[00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:07.960]   Now, because I'm using Wealthfront, I don't actually think about any of this.
[00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:09.860]   It's all automated happening in the background.
[00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:15.700]   You know, it's one of the things I'm really thankful for is during the pandemic, the market was down.
[00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:18.300]   No one knew if it was going to keep going or if it was going to stop.
[00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:19.620]   Do I tax loss harvest now?
[00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:20.200]   Do I wait?
[00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:22.880]   And my portfolio was totally automated.
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:24.100]   I didn't even look at it.
[00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:35.220]   But I ended the year with a bunch of harvested losses, which was not good from the perspective of losses mean the portfolio is down, but great from the perspective of the market recovered.
[00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:38.280]   And so I was never unexposed to the market.
[00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:47.940]   I didn't miss all the gains that came after the losses, but I did capture those losses and I've used them for other gains to offset over the years since that happened.
[00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:52.240]   And so if you want to check out Wealthfront, it's a product I use.
[00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:53.500]   They're not a sponsor of the show.
[00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:59.020]   I've got a referral link to get your first $5,000 managed free, but it's basically an automated investment portfolio.
[00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:08.240]   They'll help you figure out a portfolio that's globally diversified, all low-cost, low-fee index funds, and then they'll just automatically rebalance and tax loss harvest it.
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:09.180]   I did work there.
[00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:11.420]   I am a shareholder of the company from working there.
[00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:12.940]   Huge fan of the product.
[00:43:12.940 --> 00:43:16.820]   And, you know, the majority of our net worth is sitting in our Wealthfront account.
[00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:19.920]   So that's how I'm thinking about the current market.
[00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:25.040]   That's a lot of what has been on my mind the last few days, some of the deals I found.
[00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:27.340]   I hope this episode was interesting and helpful.
[00:43:27.340 --> 00:43:29.320]   Please send me a note.
[00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:30.440]   Let me know what you think.
[00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:32.600]   Should I do more episodes like this or not?
[00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:34.420]   Your feedback is greatly appreciated.
[00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:37.320]   You can send it to podcast at allthehacks.com.
[00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:38.580]   You can find me on socials.
[00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:40.620]   You can use the contact form on the website.
[00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:42.240]   That is it for this week.
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:43.500]   I will see you next week.
