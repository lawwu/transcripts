[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.100]   The microbiome is an incredibly important area of research and functional medicine,
[00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.000]   which I've been doing for years.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.100]   It's basically the fundamental way we get people better is start with healing
[00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.600]   the gut because everything starts in the gut from things that are obvious like
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.500]   digestive issues all the way from autism to Alzheimer's from heart disease to
[00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.300]   cancer to asthma to obesity.
[00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.900]   All these things are related to the gut microbiome even from schizophrenia to
[00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.500]   depression to anxiety to OCD all can be related to changing the microbiome.
[00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.600]   And so we're this frontier of microbiome research that is now helping us
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.600]   understand how critical the microbiome is in every aspect of our health.
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.800]   And yet, unfortunately, doctors don't pay attention to it.
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.700]   Don't do anything about it.
[00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.500]   Don't focus on it because they don't learn about it.
[00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.500]   But it's fundamental to the functional practice of functional medicine and what
[00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.500]   we've been doing for decades.
[00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.500]   So learning how to take care of your microbiome tending your inner garden is
[00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.800]   one of the most essential things you do.
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.300]   And I've written about this in many of my books particularly young forever.
[00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.700]   I talked about it and how to keep your gut healthy.
[00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.400]   So it's an essential feature and just by eating the right foods.
