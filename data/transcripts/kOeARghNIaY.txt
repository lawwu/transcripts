[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.420]   All right, everybody, welcome back. It's hot swap summer here
[00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:10.720]   at the all in pod cast, episode 186 of the world's number one
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.660]   podcast, calling in from the home office in Italy. Chum off
[00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:16.980]   Polly. How are you doing, sir?
[00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.860]   Great. How are you? You look so relaxed. Look at you. Look at
[00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:22.020]   you.
[00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.000]   But it's only been two days that I'm working. I mean, I'm not
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.580]   that relaxed yet. But this place does put you in the right mood.
[00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.260]   I gotta say, all right, sacks. I'm sure that it's been an
[00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.940]   uneventful week for you. How are you doing in the great state of
[00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.900]   California from our headquarters at the all in tower in San
[00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.380]   Francisco? How's the all in tower doing? Why are you doxing
[00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.700]   me? What's going on here?
[00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.620]   Because you live in San Francisco. Everybody knows
[00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.700]   that. All you have to do is look for the protests. Follow the
[00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.620]   protests. And she'll find sex also with us, of course, from
[00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.580]   the Ohalo headquarters. Is that backdraft? The house is on fire.
[00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.660]   The house is on fire. But how's your referring to which house
[00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.340]   which house America, which one of your Democrats or Biden's
[00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.620]   house? There's a political party there. I mean, you can
[00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.460]   interpret it as you wish. Oh, okay. Your butt is your butt on
[00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.340]   fire. Did you have some Indian food? Did you hit the taco truck?
[00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.100]   What? There's a heat wave in the west right now. He stopped at
[00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.020]   the taco truck. The West is on fire. The West is on fire. Okay.
[00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.660]   Okay, Dr. Doom, if you want to come to the all in summit now in
[00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:33.180]   year three, we've got a ton of programming updates, but the
[00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.100]   tickets are going to sell out. We just released another ticket.
[00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.660]   Sorry, you have a fly like attacking your head right now.
[00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.940]   You look like Mike Pence. Jesus. Is it a Mike Pence moment? That's
[00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.100]   a Mike Pence fly. It's a Mike Pence fly. Yeah, it is a Pence
[00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.280]   moment. Or it could be like a Biden moment circling the dead.
[00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.300]   That's too hard. It's pretty dark. Okay. Three.
[00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:19.220]   For folks who are interested in meeting the other lunatics who

[00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.020]   applications in. And if you are trying to score a ticket or

[00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.660]   Friedberg, any updates on the content people want to know
[00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:04.740]   what's on the on the docket,
[00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.180]   we're definitely going to be talking about the changing
[00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.300]   landscape of American politics. So we are going to have some
[00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.420]   representation there. To have that conversation, we're going
[00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.420]   to be talking about the future of media, we're going to be
[00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.220]   doing some really cool technology deep dives in areas
[00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.180]   like robotics, age reversal, eVTOLs, and talking a lot about
[00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.860]   AI meets enterprise software. So we have a number of, you know,
[00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.540]   the leading enterprise software CEOs joining us for
[00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.860]   conversations on that front. So it's shaping up to be really
[00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.980]   amazing programming. Like Jason said, we're, we held back 400
[00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.620]   tickets from the initial batch, and we're going to release 100
[00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.020]   this week. So put an application in, we're trying to be
[00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.620]   selective. And it's going to be amazing at the parties are going
[00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.860]   to be awesome. All right, really excited how it's coming together.
[00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.580]   You're doing some bird of a feather dinners, I understand
[00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.420]   that you have some new concept. Can you explain that to me?
[00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.500]   The first night of the summit, we're we've rented out a bunch
[00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.380]   of great restaurants around town in LA. And we're putting people
[00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.780]   together for dinner at all these different restaurants. And then
[00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.020]   the parties are nights two and three, which are going to be,
[00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.700]   you know, beautiful. Everybody's gonna be great.
[00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.020]   Everybody comes to the parties. But that first night, everyone
[00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.580]   comes to the dinners, everything. Yeah, it's gonna be
[00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.540]   great. So we're trying to create more space for people to meet
[00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.100]   with each other. I know that's been a big thing in the past in
[00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.420]   the meetups. And at the summit is people love meeting other
[00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:21.900]   folks in the community. So
[00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.700]   yes, smaller groups. So the dinners will be 200 people or
[00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.780]   something like that. You can expect 100 depending on the
[00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.860]   location. Yeah. And then the bigger parties will be everybody
[00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.980]   1800 people. So where do people apply for this?
[00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.220]   It's at summit.all in podcast.com.
[00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.020]   Okay, there you go, folks. And you can come to the free events
[00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.980]   when you come there. All right, just usually we when we do the
[00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.860]   dock and I pursue a mullet docket, I do the business first
[00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.780]   and the party in the back. But man, we got to start with
[00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.300]   Washington. I've never supported the mullet strategy.
[00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.220]   I know that. I know that you've been anti mullet from the
[00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.060]   beginning. You want this to be a political show?
[00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.820]   No, no, no, no. I never said a political show. I always said we
[00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.820]   start with the biggest most topical issues first. And it
[00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.100]   could be business or it could be politics. Correct. You were
[00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.420]   discriminating against the politics. You were insisting
[00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:09.420]   that it be a business issue, even if the business wasn't
[00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.580]   relevant, topical or interesting.
[00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.060]   Here we go. No, I was not. I think you're talking about
[00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.820]   freeberg. freeberg was the one.
[00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.420]   That's true. It mostly came from freeberg. Who is right? Who
[00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:21.660]   brought the ratings this pod to a whole new level?
[00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.380]   Yeah, freeberg Maga lunatics.
[00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:25.260]   That's this thing.
[00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.300]   From Robin Hood. He is the guy who did it.
[00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:35.860]   By the way, I mean, the ratings this pod hit some sort of new
[00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.580]   stratospheric level, not just with President Trump interview,
[00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:40.780]   but last week,
[00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:45.140]   whatever. I mean, the point is, last week was, I think the most
[00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:49.820]   crazy week in the history of politics, and it's only going to
[00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.660]   get crazier. So let's start off with hotswap summer, you heard
[00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.500]   it here first, or maybe not hotswap summer continues, you
[00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.540]   know, previously, historically, if you wanted to understand
[00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.100]   who's winning an election, you'd look at the polls, not
[00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:02.780]   perfect, obviously, some of these polls still call
[00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.140]   landlines, yada, yada. But then people built models, obviously,
[00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.980]   538, all this kind of stuff. But it seems that this year, and
[00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.540]   this election cycle, people are really focused on prediction
[00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:18.020]   markets, aka betting markets, and we're looking at them in
[00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.460]   real time. And obviously, people have skin in the game. So you
[00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.420]   can I'm interested in the panel's take on the sharps on
[00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:27.940]   these platforms. And if you think that they're more accurate
[00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:31.780]   than, say, some of these polls, or the aggregators of polls, but
[00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:35.540]   Kamala Harris is now the favorite to be the Democratic
[00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:39.340]   nominee, according to one of them. So just let that soak in.
[00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.900]   In the last 24 hours, VP Harris's chances of being the
[00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:48.260]   Democratic nominee have gone from 18% to 50%. At the same
[00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:53.380]   time, President Biden has dropped from 66% to 28%. There
[00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.860]   are a bunch of long shots moonshots in there. You said
[00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:00.300]   Michelle Obama, Gretchen Whitmer, all in the 812%. But
[00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:05.340]   they were low single digits prior to last week's debate. As
[00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.980]   you can see in the chart, Biden Harris were about even this
[00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:13.660]   morning, the taping of this is Wednesday, July 3. But the New
[00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:18.300]   York Times reported that Biden called an ally he's considering
[00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:22.820]   dropping out. So we should note, the White House White House
[00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:26.620]   spokesman said this is absolutely false. But this is
[00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:30.900]   the money chart from I think Polly market. And we keep
[00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:33.940]   updating this document in real time while we're taping chances
[00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:39.260]   of biting dropping out are now at 77%. That's up from 60% this
[00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:43.900]   morning, 40% after the debate, after we record the show, we
[00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:46.060]   have to do before we publish the whole
[00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:48.780]   well, I don't think he's going to do that because he is
[00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:52.140]   scheduled to do a sit down interview with George
[00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:55.860]   Stephanopoulos. I think they're recording it on Friday, right,
[00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:57.700]   which is there. Oh,
[00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:02.420]   he's gonna do an interview with Stephanopoulos on Friday, and
[00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:05.460]   then Stephanopoulos is showing it in two parts on Saturday and
[00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:08.100]   Sunday. So it's going to be edited. So we don't know what
[00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:11.340]   they're going to edit in or edit out. At this point, though, the
[00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:14.780]   media is in such a freeding frenzy that I don't think that
[00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:19.780]   ABC is going to cover for Biden. So I suspect it'll probably be a
[00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:23.540]   pretty fair representation of the actual recorded interview.
[00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:26.780]   In any event, that's coming out this weekend. I think the Biden
[00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:30.180]   presidency basically hinges on this interview, if Biden can
[00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:35.700]   show that he's sharp, and he's responsive and not senile. And
[00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:37.660]   presumably, he's going to sit down and do this at the best
[00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:39.900]   hours of the day, right? They can't make that excuse anymore.
[00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:42.140]   So is that before nap time or after nap time?
[00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:46.220]   Right, exactly. So I'm sure he can do this at a time when he
[00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:49.220]   has the good stuff. I think if he knocks out of the park, maybe
[00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:52.900]   he can quell all of this speculation. But if not, if it
[00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:54.580]   goes poorly, then I think he's done.
[00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:58.140]   So this is the last chance. Again, it's like this is like
[00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:01.220]   this is like the last chance. Yeah, because think about it. I
[00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:05.100]   mean, the accusation is that he's senile. That's not a hard
[00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:08.660]   thing to disprove. If you're not actually senile, right, you just
[00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:14.820]   need to go in there. Right? It's a pretty low bar, right? Yeah.
[00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:18.540]   So he just needs to go in there and pause for whatever it is an
[00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:21.780]   hour. And he's not gonna be fed a hard, hardball question.
[00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:24.580]   Probably a pretty softball question. He just has to prove
[00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:27.700]   that he's not senile. If he can do that, it'll calm things down.
[00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:31.380]   Stephanopoulos generally does a good job. He's not a sycophant.
[00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:34.700]   I think he he considers himself a legit journalist and we'll
[00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:35.420]   we'll actually
[00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:36.180]   well, this is
[00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:38.380]   some fastballs. I think
[00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:42.980]   Bernstein moment. I mean, like if if Stephanopoulos wants to go
[00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:45.900]   into the Hall of Fame, this is his opportunity if he absolutely
[00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:49.860]   if he throws the high heater to Biden and basically is the one
[00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:55.940]   that delivers the coup de grace, then his name will be in history
[00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:57.340]   alongside Biden for that.
[00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:00.140]   But think about it. That's think about the strategy. If you're
[00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:05.260]   the if you're the Democratic Party leaders, and you are
[00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:10.420]   evaluating who to choose to replace Biden, the first thing
[00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:14.940]   you do is you have to double down on Biden. Because if you
[00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:19.460]   were neutral to negative on Biden, or passive, it's
[00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:21.820]   immediately interpreted as he's being swapped out, and then you
[00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:24.340]   don't have time to pick the right candidate. In order to
[00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:26.380]   have the time to pick the right candidate, you have to first
[00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:28.980]   double down on Biden, be really declarative that he's our
[00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:32.180]   candidate, put him on media, put him on talk shows while you were
[00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.300]   figuring out who's going to replace him, and what the
[00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:37.460]   strategy is to get that person to win. So there's a there's a
[00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:39.780]   chance that what's actually going on is a little bit more of
[00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:43.300]   a structured strategy around, find the right candidate, set up
[00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:46.500]   the right program to get them elected, figure out how we're
[00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:49.580]   going to move the $120 million that we raised from Biden over
[00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:52.580]   to whoever this new candidate, you can only you can only move
[00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:56.180]   it to Harris, you cannot move it, you cannot move the entire
[00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:56.580]   right.
[00:10:56.580 --> 00:11:00.100]   Entirely. So you've got you've got to put together a real plan.
[00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:02.380]   You can't just do the hot swap. You've got to have a plan for
[00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:04.860]   the hot swap, which means in the meantime, you got to buy time.
[00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:07.660]   And the best time is throw Biden forward and be like, Hey, look,
[00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:10.020]   this guy's gonna go. Yeah, you're still our guy.
[00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:12.260]   You're correct that they're buying time, obviously, while
[00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.860]   they try to figure this out. And the powers that be which powers
[00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:18.980]   that be the Biden camp, which is not the political machine. It's
[00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:24.340]   his literal family, Hunter, GL, etc. What they're actually
[00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:28.340]   doing, and this will be the next Nostra Canis prediction that
[00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:29.980]   will come true is they're going to
[00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:36.940]   I didn't have time to get like a whole lot. All I heard was like
[00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:43.540]   my anus is NIS not NUS. So Nostra Canis prediction coming
[00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:47.700]   in here. Here's what will happen. They are going to do
[00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:52.260]   all caps locks, all caps locks alert must credit Nostra Canis,
[00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.740]   they're going to do a democratic primary speed run. Here's
[00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:58.460]   what's going to happen. They're going to do five debates in 10
[00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:02.060]   weeks. And then whoever wins wins Kamala, he's going to
[00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:07.700]   resign Kamala becomes president. Kamala gets to run doesn't run.
[00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:10.220]   She gets to speed run like everybody else. Dean Phillips
[00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:13.940]   gets to come in, everybody speed runs it. The they take over the
[00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:19.020]   media. The media will go crazy over the summer massive ratings.
[00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:24.420]   Boom. And we have a winner come in. And they demolish Trump.
[00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:26.580]   That's not gonna happen. You said he's not going to get hop
[00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:30.100]   swapped as well. Nostra Canis has gone off the rails. You said
[00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:34.060]   he wouldn't get hot swap. So you have no question. If you run a
[00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:38.820]   debate, it shows it. The party the party needs to select a
[00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:41.580]   leader and they need to say this is our candidate because if they
[00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:44.540]   if they do this, it's too diffuse. It knows whoever ends
[00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:48.580]   up winning. It's trying to bring is it strengthens the party. It
[00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:52.300]   shrinks the party to say listen, he decided to resign. We wanted
[00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:55.140]   to do the most democratic thing possible. What's the most
[00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:58.020]   democratic thing possible. We put all our candidates out there
[00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:00.500]   and you the people choose to mop tell them I'm right.
[00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:04.980]   I think this is one of the dumbest predictions. You've made
[00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:07.220]   all right, you made some real doozies in your day. The hot
[00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:10.060]   swaps gonna happen. So you didn't call it the problem with
[00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:13.980]   your hot swap theory has always been that not only would Biden
[00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:16.460]   step down, but that magically they would choose the best
[00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:20.020]   candidate we would get a Jeff Bezos, we get a Jamie Dimon,
[00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:23.020]   that somehow we would get someone who represented all of
[00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:25.580]   Trump's policies without being Trump, but you would get some
[00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:28.700]   magical moderate to emerge the Democratic Party. That's not
[00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:32.220]   going to happen. Okay. Okay. Thanks to your incessant demands
[00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:35.980]   for the hot swap. Okay, you and many others and this feeding.
[00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:39.540]   I love it. Yeah, you in part along with many others have
[00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:43.140]   caused this feeding frenzy. We are going to get President
[00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:45.780]   Kamala Harris, she's the only alternative. You can see this in
[00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:49.420]   the prediction markets. Just a few days ago, it was sort of
[00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:52.300]   evenly divided between there was her there was Gavin Newsom.
[00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:54.540]   There's Gretchen Whitmer. Now it's just her. Why is that
[00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:57.860]   happened? Because they realized they can't sidestep Kamala
[00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:01.540]   Harris without offending a major constituency in the Democratic
[00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:04.860]   Party, equally important, maybe even more important, they would
[00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:07.660]   lose roughly a billion dollars of contributions to the Biden
[00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:12.340]   Harris campaign. If neither Biden nor Harris is running at
[00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:15.460]   the top of the ticket, they'd have to refund all of that money
[00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:18.460]   back to the donors who contributed it, there's no way
[00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:22.060]   they're going to start over from zero in terms of fundraising. So
[00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:26.740]   they've realized that if Joe steps aside, there is only one
[00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:29.220]   feasible candidate for them, which is Kamala Harris. Let me
[00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:32.500]   ask you a question. If Jamie Dimon declared that he's going
[00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:36.260]   to, he would be happy to take on the candidacy for the Democratic
[00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:40.740]   Party. He would call his friend Warren Buffett, he would call
[00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:45.060]   his friend, Jeff Bezos, he would call up his own personal banker
[00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:48.300]   and say, we've got half a billion, let's go. And let's
[00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:51.580]   have a run at this. There are certain folks that are outside
[00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:55.060]   of the typical political spectrum, that might actually
[00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:58.500]   have a shot at doing the extraordinary here, and stepping
[00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:02.660]   up and doing exactly what Trump and others that support Trump
[00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:06.540]   don't want to see happen, which is a candidate that can actually
[00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:09.780]   challenge Trump on the merits of their experience, on their
[00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:13.900]   values, on their capabilities as leaders as executives, and on
[00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:16.900]   their past performance. And I think that someone like that
[00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:22.860]   might be the strategists kind of move to say, this is the one
[00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:26.180]   thing we can do that can defeat Trump, because we all know from
[00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:28.420]   the polling, that Harris doesn't stand a shot.
[00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:31.060]   We tried that four years ago, and you're missing the history,
[00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:34.420]   which is Mike Bloomberg tried that exact same thing. And there
[00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:38.220]   was one word that was said to Mike, his candidates imploded.
[00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:40.860]   And it was the word billionaire. So the idea that you're going to
[00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:44.020]   get some other billionaire that all of a sudden is less hated. I
[00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:46.660]   mean, Mike Bloomberg has done some so much good, quite
[00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:50.820]   honestly. And so if he can't kind of escape the scarlet
[00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:53.180]   letter of that of the B word, I don't know anybody else.
[00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:56.780]   But here's why Bloomberg ran against other Democrats. This is
[00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:59.260]   a person that is running against another billionaire, which is
[00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.740]   Trump. And so if you have two people who are now on equal
[00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:04.380]   footing, and it is the Trump
[00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:08.940]   person gets a lot of people in this country, I suspect,
[00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:12.500]   let him cook. That's go for it. That's that you're operating
[00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:15.420]   you're operating under the charming delusion that the
[00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:19.940]   Democratic Party cares about democracy. This is basically a
[00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:23.540]   party that's run by political insiders that hates billionaires
[00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:27.040]   and people like this. People like Warren Buffett and Jamie
[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:30.780]   Dimon. They pay the Democrats protection money. Okay, that's
[00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:33.540]   how Democrats see them. We're going to go shake them down to
[00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:35.940]   get money from them. They're not going to hand over the reins of
[00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:37.900]   the party. I don't disagree to some
[00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:39.540]   let me ask you a question.
[00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:42.860]   Yes, but
[00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:46.740]   he rewrote the rules of the party by running your
[00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:51.180]   Oh, he shut down. Hold on. He ran and shattered the party the
[00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:53.820]   established power structure. Remember, it was it was the Bush
[00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:57.560]   family's party. When Trump first ran, Jeb was supposed to be the
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:00.720]   nominee, right? He was supposed to write inherit the mantle from
[00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:04.720]   W the way that W inherited from his father. And Trump came in
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:08.220]   there and appealed directly to Republican primary voters, and
[00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:10.860]   called the forever wars a mistake, and said he was going
[00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:13.320]   to build the wall and said he's going to reset things with
[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:17.680]   China issues that were latent in the Republican Party. And he
[00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:19.620]   took over the Republican Party the way you're supposed to
[00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:22.920]   through democracy, through voting, that opportunity has
[00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:25.720]   gone here because or the democratic primaries happened
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:29.920]   last year. And the Biden team ensured that he would basically
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:33.060]   win the primaries and Lee, so they control all the delegates.
[00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:35.580]   Remember that totally control the delegates, they're not going
[00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:39.400]   to release them to a Jamie Dimon or some other billionaire. Well,
[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:42.100]   let me ask you a question. Party. Let me let me ask you a
[00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:45.680]   question. So if they if they end up facing the terminal nature of
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:49.360]   this, which is, if we don't put someone in that can win, we lose,
[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:52.440]   we are not going to win. Yeah, it is over. Why do you think
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:55.500]   that Pamela can't win? That's their thinking right now is that
[00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:58.240]   she stands a better shot than by let's assume let's assume that
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:01.240]   they take a read of the polls, they take a read of the nation,
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:04.760]   they actually do a real look at the circumstances on the ground,
[00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:08.120]   which is that she is not going to win. If they looked at that,
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:12.180]   and they said, you know what, we need to win. And some sense comes
[00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:15.080]   into the head of the leaders of the Democratic Party. And they
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:19.080]   say, who can win? And a person like Jamie Dimon polls that he
[00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:22.800]   can win. There is a chance, I think that maybe they say this
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:24.360]   is how we're going to get back to the White House.
[00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:27.760]   They're never going to hand the reins of the party to a total
[00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:31.800]   outside the Democratic Party is the ultimate insider party. And
[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:33.600]   they are going to pick an insights insiders picking
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:36.760]   insiders. And I think they've realized over the past week, in
[00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:39.920]   particular, that they cannot sidestep around Kamala Harris,
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:42.920]   both because it would be a slap in the face to her constituency
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:46.420]   and the money issue. So it's Kamala or bus for them. It's
[00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:47.160]   either Kamala or
[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.880]   I think it's a really good. It's a really good point. What
[00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:52.360]   we'll see is just how rational hope the Democratic Party
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:55.880]   leadership is, are they going to continue to play based on
[00:18:55.880 --> 00:19:01.000]   insider first principles? Or will they actually take a first
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.400]   principles point of view on how do we win the election? And I
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:07.200]   think it will be very revealing about how the leaders of the
[00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:10.760]   Democratic Party think, based on the decision they make, and
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:12.840]   their donors. Well, I don't know if that's true, because I
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:15.480]   actually think that there's a donors are fleeing the ship,
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:18.440]   right? Yeah, there's a rift between the donor class and the
[00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:20.800]   Democratic Party leadership, correct. And I think the donor
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:23.520]   class doesn't want to lose. And by the way, sacks, what you're
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:26.120]   saying is probably right. But I think it could actually end up
[00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:29.520]   being a signal that there might be a change in how the who the
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:34.240]   donors end up supporting the next go around. For to realize
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:35.960]   this, a leadership change in the Democratic Party.
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:38.760]   Look what the prediction markets are showing is that it's not
[00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:41.280]   going to be a free fall. It's either going to be Harris or
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:43.240]   Biden. I mean, that's what the prediction markets are showing.
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:47.080]   And I think that's fundamentally right. But look, I think there's
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:51.120]   real danger here to the to the country in this, because what a
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:53.620]   lot of people are saying, and I guess it makes sense is that if
[00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:57.680]   Biden's not fit to run again, how is he fit to serve out the
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:58.240]   rest of his term?
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:00.600]   He's not fit to serve on his term, he's got to resign.
[00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:03.840]   Okay, so if he resigns, and that's probably the thing that
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:07.520]   helps Harris the most, right? Because now, she gets sworn in
[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:10.960]   as commander in chief. She's the President of the United States.
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:14.160]   First female president. Yeah, it's a major glow up for her.
[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:17.960]   And it imbues her with all of this gravitas and credibility
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:21.040]   that she's now the President United States, they can send her
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:24.120]   to G7 meetings and deal with other world leaders. They've got
[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:28.080]   four months to basically take this candidate who everyone
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:30.880]   thought wasn't ready. Remember, a year ago during the primaries,
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:34.080]   when Biden ran again, one of the reasons why is because everyone
[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:36.800]   said that comments is not ready. You know, every interview she
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:40.560]   does is basically a cackle or word salad. In any event,
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:45.760]   no one thought she was ready. Now. They have, like basically
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:49.680]   made her seem much more significant by giving her the
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:52.240]   presidency. But my point is this, we're in the middle of a
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:57.520]   war. We're in the middle of a war with Russia. Just a week or
[00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:00.080]   two ago, we are Russian that we're in the war, or we're
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:05.440]   providing weapons. Both a week or two ago, American cluster
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:09.840]   bombs were used to kill Russian civilian sunbathing.
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:14.480]   On the beach in Crimea. Okay, our weapons are targeting,
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:18.560]   killing Russian civilians. The Russians in response to that
[00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:22.480]   said, we are no longer in a state of peace with the United
[00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:25.120]   States. They did not say we're in a state of war. But they say
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:27.440]   we're no longer in a state of peace. And the Russians have
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:32.000]   indicated that they may escalate horizontally by giving advanced
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.280]   weapons to our enemies. For example, they've talked about
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:39.360]   giving cruise missiles to the hoodies. Okay, so all of this is
[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:42.080]   happening right now in real time on the world stage. And
[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:44.800]   you're going to remove Biden who look, I don't like Biden's
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:49.440]   policies. And I don't think he's competent us for more than a
[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:53.760]   few hours a day. But I would still rather have Biden as
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:56.480]   commander in chief for the next six months, then take the risk
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:59.600]   of putting Harrison there, who's inexperienced, who's a
[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:03.040]   lightweight, and who might want to prove how tough she is.
[00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:05.120]   Let's get your mouth in for the final word here, Chamath your
[00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:07.280]   thoughts on what's going to happen make your prediction
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:11.040]   between now and September? What do you think's the the mid game
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:12.880]   here? Before we get to the end game?
[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:17.920]   I honestly don't know. But I think that we're in a precarious
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:23.280]   place where things are going to get worse. Biden actually
[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:28.400]   approved private contractors now going into Ukraine and starting
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:32.800]   to fight Americans will be on the battlefield as of I think
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:37.840]   this was just a few days ago. If you remember the movie Wag the
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:40.640]   Dog, I think that it starts to create all these weird
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:45.360]   scenarios where people will want to create major distractions
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:49.760]   to try to keep the evidence and the attention away from this
[00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:52.560]   core issue that after the debate, everybody is focused on.
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:55.680]   I think the reality is that if you were accused, if any of you
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:59.520]   were accused of being mentally incapacitated, what you would
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:03.200]   probably do is go on every single talk show, go on every
[00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:05.760]   single news show, go on every single podcast, press
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:11.040]   conference, you would just do so much public facing work so as
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:14.320]   to completely dispel this idea so that you could firmly say it
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:18.960]   was a cold. Although now this week, it's jet lag, it was, it
[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:23.520]   was jet lag, the time of day, whatever it was, you'd be able
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:27.840]   to just completely take the wind out of the sails. I think we're
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:32.320]   still getting only a controlled dribble of information and
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:35.360]   access to the President of the United States. So he's going to
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:39.120]   be on Stephanopoulos, he's going to show up for a NATO meeting.
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:43.280]   And so you're only seeing drips and drabs of somebody who now a
[00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:46.640]   lot of people think is not in a position, not just to run, but
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:49.680]   let alone run the country. You said last week, Democrat Party
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:53.600]   will have a meaningful reset. Still, still thinking match
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.840]   among the issue that the Democrats will have to face is
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:59.120]   the person that they probably want to run is someone different
[00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:02.480]   than Kamala Harris. And the problem that they're going to
[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:05.520]   have to confront is, there's a part of it, which is
[00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:07.680]   fundraising. And I do think that David's right, there was an
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:10.880]   article in the FT, where one of the op ed writers said, they're
[00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:13.680]   in this sort of identity politics trap in sorts, because
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:17.040]   they will have to run her no matter what. And even if
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:20.640]   somebody did show up with the financial wherewithal, and I
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:23.680]   think, free book actually brings up a really interesting
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:26.320]   thought experiment. If there was somebody that could take the
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:28.800]   democratic mantle who could completely self fund their
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:34.880]   campaign, but he happened to be just a white man, what would the
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:38.320]   Democrats do relative to Kamala Harris, and I think that they
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:41.520]   would be in knots around what to do because of the identity
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:45.200]   politics issue. I think they have made it an important issue,
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:49.360]   this idea of inclusiveness as they've defined it. So it sets
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:52.800]   up for I think, a very complicated summer. Yeah. The
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:54.960]   other thing you have to keep in mind is how the electoral
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:58.160]   college works and how the ballot system works is that you don't
[00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:00.800]   have infinite time, you have to get all of this wrapped up and
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:05.840]   cinched up by the middle of August at the latest. And so
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:09.040]   we're very much on like a four or six week shot clock. And I
[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:14.080]   don't think the democrats are doing what they need to do in
[00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:17.040]   order to completely take the wind out of the sails of this
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:20.640]   narrative that Biden is not prepared or capable. And the
[00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:24.320]   only way that you can do that is by having him appear 24 by
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:27.680]   seven in real time, in front of hundreds of millions of people
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:30.160]   as often as possible. And they're just not so since
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:33.760]   they're not doing it, they had ample time to do it. He's Yeah,
[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:36.080]   he's, he's obviously by the way, the other the other problem
[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:39.040]   that it creates is that you're starting to see some of these
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:42.160]   fissures inside of the team, there was a really charged
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:45.840]   article from axios that drop, which basically said that there
[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:48.160]   are three people that have cordoned off access to the
[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:51.600]   president. It named Yeah, that was Joe Biden, and Tomasini and
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:54.000]   some other person. And my initial thought when I read
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.720]   this was other than Joe Biden, who's a recognizable person, I
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:59.520]   had no idea who these other two people were. And I thought
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:03.840]   that's really precise for somebody like that, who has
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:07.280]   inside access to all of these sort of insiders to put that
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:11.040]   article up. So I think you're starting to see the sort of
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:14.320]   leaks and the fissures. And then that's sort of this next
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:16.560]   phase that will make things a little bit ugly and contorted.
[00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:18.560]   Let me ask one question here, because we got we got to move
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:23.920]   on to the Supreme Court stuff. sacks to poor question one, is
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:27.200]   there a chance that he has had a diagnosis already, and they're
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:31.200]   covering that up? And two, if they covered up something like
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:36.720]   that? What is the ramification of it? Because it's clear to
[00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:39.520]   everybody he's in cognitive decline. It's clear. It's been a
[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:41.280]   couple of years of cognitive decline.
[00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:45.520]   No, no, that was asked of KJP in a press conference yesterday.
[00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:48.720]   She was very explicit. No. And the reason no, that she doesn't
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:52.000]   know. She doesn't know. No, no, the answer was much more
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.600]   explicit. Has he been diagnosed? And she said no. And the reason
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:58.480]   she said no is because that is very credible for her to say
[00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:01.440]   because he hasn't taken the test. Okay, so that's your
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:05.040]   theory. Look, it was obvious now for months, if not years,
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:08.400]   that there's been a huge cover up of his cognitive decline.
[00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:12.080]   And the media has participated in this anyone who raised that
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:15.680]   question was treated as being a partisan or a liar. And just for
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:18.400]   a good example of this, I know you described George
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:21.360]   Stephanopoulos as a straight shooter. But when Nikki Haley
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:24.080]   was on his show a few months ago, and I'm not a fan of Nikki
[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:27.280]   Haley at all, but she started making this point. And
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:29.360]   Stephanopoulos basically wouldn't let her finish. I mean,
[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:32.880]   basically shouted her down. So the media was actively
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:36.880]   suppressing the story. You take Morning Joe, a Scarborough. He
[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:39.280]   was saying that this version of Biden is the best he's ever
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:41.360]   been. And we've been hearing all of that kind of stuff for
[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:46.080]   months, they were describing true videos showing Biden being
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:49.120]   out of it, they were describing those as being fakes, clean
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:53.120]   fakes, they invented this new term for perfectly real videos
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:55.760]   that basically would reflect his condition. So the media has
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:58.640]   been engaged in a gigantic cover up of this. And as a result,
[00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:02.960]   the country is in really bad shape, because we have to go
[00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:06.800]   through the next six months, either with a senile president
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:10.880]   who has limited cognition, or we could end up with a new
[00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:15.520]   president who was untested, inexperienced, and based on
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:18.080]   every interview she's given in the last four years, appears to
[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:21.680]   be completely clueless at a moment in time where I think we
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:24.240]   have the most dangerous foreign policy situation since the
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:28.480]   Cuban Missile Crisis. So this is a really horrible situation.
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:32.000]   And hold on, it's the media bears a lot of responsibility.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.960]   And what should have happened, okay, what should have happened
[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:38.960]   is we should have had a robust Democratic primary a year ago.
[00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:43.760]   Sure, based on concerns about binds cognitive abilities
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:46.400]   reported by an honest media. We never had that.
[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:49.680]   Yeah. So you guys see this clip, by the way, there's a clip on
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:53.120]   Twitter, where somebody put together a clip on x, six
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:59.680]   minutes of 100, sort of spokespeople and proxies. And
[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:02.000]   they all had the same thing to say about President Biden, which
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.400]   is he is sharp as attack, sharp as sharp as attack, which ended
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:09.280]   the tag the round part. What was so funny to me is I thought to
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:13.120]   myself, if I asked 100 people on the street, what do you think
[00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:16.480]   of Elon Musk, you'd have 100 different statements, there'd be
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:20.880]   a general theme. But you would not have even 50 people repeat
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:24.640]   the exact same words points, obviously. And so you have this
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:27.520]   funny situation where 100 different people were basically
[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:30.240]   saying the exact same talking point. So it's not even a point
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:33.680]   of view. It was just something that they were told to say by
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:36.400]   somebody else. And that's your point. Both sides. acts is the
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:38.800]   real issue, which is that you don't really have an honest
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:42.160]   media here. And so there is no check and balance on power
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:42.640]   right now.
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:45.280]   Imagine if this feeding frenzy happened a year ago.
[00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:48.400]   Well, the contrast and compare I want to make is everybody has a
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:51.360]   point of view about Donald Trump. And I was thinking about
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:53.760]   this. The reason why everybody has a point of view about Donald
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:57.360]   Trump is everything that has happened in his life is
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:00.320]   completely transparently documented. There really is
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:03.520]   nothing hidden at this point. And so you have a point of view
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:07.520]   because you've been given all of the stuff. Right? And there's
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:10.960]   endless amounts of new stuff that come out about the old
[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:15.040]   stuff. And so you know, and that's what's so interesting,
[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:18.320]   you have the ability to come to your own decision, and it's not
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:21.280]   packaged through these filters. Yet with President Biden, I
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:25.600]   think it's so constrained and controlled. And I think you have
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:29.120]   to understand and appreciate that cognitive decline, let's
[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:31.840]   assume that he isn't for the sake of the United States. But
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:35.360]   if he is in it, it only gets worse from here. And it
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:38.560]   compounds and compounds and compounds. That is what happens.
[00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:41.920]   And so not only do you have to wonder what the next five months
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:45.680]   are like, what does it look like in 18 and 24 and 36 months?
[00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:48.800]   That is a really important issue here.
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:51.440]   Clearly, Biden can't serve a second term. But the question is
[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:55.760]   what what do we do now? And I gotta say, it's amazing to me
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:31:00.320]   that the democrats are not considering the one option that
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:03.760]   is kind of obvious, which is you let the man run the most
[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:07.920]   dignified campaign he can. He's a candidate you chose, and
[00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:12.000]   satire sacks is back here. This is not satire. This is not
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.720]   satire sacks. The real problem here is the democrats refuse to
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:19.040]   lose. They want to cling to power. However, they can't they
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:23.040]   refuse to let democracy just work democracy working would be
[00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:25.200]   to do the speed run. I have a question. What would you do with
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:28.080]   the money? Would you just not spend it then? And just save it?
[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:30.240]   Well, this is really interesting. So there is an
[00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:35.200]   analog. Okay, in 1996, Bob Dole was the Republican candidate for
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:38.320]   president. And quite frankly, he was too old. He was seen as a
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:41.840]   relic. Clinton was fairly popular. And it was pretty
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:44.560]   obvious that he was just a loser and he was going to lose. The
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:47.760]   republicans engage in shenanigans to try and fix the
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:50.640]   situation. No, they just accepted the inevitable that
[00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:53.440]   Dole was going to lose. And what they did is they pulled
[00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:56.880]   financing from his campaign, at least in the final month, and
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:59.760]   they redistributed it to House and Senate candidates. And
[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:02.960]   actually, they did better. In the House and Senate, they held
[00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:06.080]   on to the House and Senate. I think they lost a few seats, but
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:08.240]   way less than they were expecting to. And they kind of
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:11.680]   ran on a campaign that, you know, you can't trust slick
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:16.880]   Willie. So keep us on split the ticket and keep us on as a check
[00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:19.760]   against him. And it actually worked fairly well. It was the
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:23.440]   best republicans could do. But frankly, they let Bob Dole run a
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:27.120]   dignified campaign. My advice to the democrats would be don't
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:31.280]   have Biden resign at doing a shake up. Listen to sacks.
[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:32.400]   There's your political
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:38.960]   right now, when you put an untested, unexperienced, clueless
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:41.440]   president in there, he's going to want to show how tough she
[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:44.080]   is and bring in her own team. No, no, no middle of this
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:47.680]   dangerous situation, let Biden run a dignified campaign and
[00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:52.560]   lose. My advice to the democrats is to embrace an outsider. Give
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:57.440]   the people what they want, freedom of choice, freedom to
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:01.600]   elect a leader and bring someone in that falls outside of the
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:04.560]   traditional political spectrum that does not want to hold
[00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:07.600]   public office, because it's not their career. They can bring
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:10.000]   money to the table, they can bring credibility to the table,
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.720]   and they can win votes and compete effectively against
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:16.400]   Trump. If your goal is to retain the White House, Kamala,
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:21.920]   give us to Jamie, Jamie Dimon, Jamie Dimon, Bob, give us a
[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:24.640]   second. Bob Iger. Yeah, it's a great one.
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:30.000]   Another great one. Yeah, it's called wish casting. You're
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.880]   doing wish casting. I'm not speaking about realism. I'm
[00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:35.680]   speaking. I'm speaking about what it would take to win. Yes,
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:38.560]   they actually want to win someone that could win a popular
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:40.480]   vote, someone that could actually win votes away from
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:43.120]   Trump, because you can't introduce someone like Whitmer
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:46.560]   or more this late in the season when no one in the United States
[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:48.880]   knows who the heck this person is. Yeah, when you have someone
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:52.240]   with credibility, with economic and business success, with
[00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:55.760]   executive authority, with capital and connections into the
[00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:58.480]   Democratic Party, but isn't part of the political machine
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:01.600]   that you and many others in the Democratic Party are now
[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:05.120]   starting to hate. Let's go have an opportunity to actually win.
[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:07.360]   Yes. And if they were smart, and they got their together,
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:09.520]   they would say, you know what, it's time for a change, just
[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:12.800]   like the Republicans had to do when they use the Republican
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:15.760]   playbook. Brilliant, Friedberg. Brilliant. Okay, well, you guys
[00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:18.480]   better have a magic lamp with a genie in it, because that's the
[00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:21.520]   only way this is going to happen. Well, listen, it's I'm
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:24.160]   just trying to keep the show fresh. Okay, okay, here we go.
[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:28.880]   Next topic. Final word. Here we go. I'm giving Friedberg the
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:33.280]   final row. He had the best take. I'm giving Friedberg the final
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:36.720]   word. Oh, you're pulling your McNeil era. Absolutely. Yeah.
[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:38.800]   Okay, here we go. There were seven rulings in a bunch of
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:42.160]   SCOTUS activity over the last week. But these are really
[00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:45.440]   important, consequential decisions. We are going to talk
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:48.800]   about three of them. And I'm going to try to get through
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:51.920]   these quickly. Obviously, you could talk about these for
[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:55.120]   hours, and people will be, you know, doing case studies on them
[00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:58.160]   for a long time. But let me try to do this quickly. So we can
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:00.160]   get everybody's take on them. The first one I want to talk
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:03.840]   about is net choice. This is the content moderation cases that
[00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:06.640]   you may have heard of, there were two very controversial laws
[00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:11.200]   passed in Florida and Texas in 2021. In the wake of January 6,
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:14.640]   the Florida law, if you weren't aware of it, and I don't suspect
[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:18.080]   most people are, would cover platforms with over 100 million
[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:21.200]   monthly active users or 100 million in annual revenue. In
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:24.560]   other words, they're targeting x YouTube, Facebook meta, those
[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:28.000]   kinds of sites. And they would require those platforms to
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.360]   notify users if their posts are removed or altered. And the
[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:33.680]   platforms would have to make general disclosures about their
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:36.960]   operations and policies. And the Texas law was very similar
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:40.160]   platforms over 50 million monthly active users, and it
[00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:42.960]   would require them to notify users whose posts were removed
[00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:46.080]   and provide an explanation of why all that kind of stuff. Both
[00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:50.000]   of these laws were challenged in court in 2021. Just to give you
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.320]   an idea like why I think the conservatives were upset about
[00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:59.280]   this. Obviously, Trump being suspended indefinitely on
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:02.160]   Twitter, Facebook and other platforms or the labeling of
[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:04.960]   content like we've seen on our own channel on YouTube. Net
[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:07.920]   choice is a tech industry group includes Facebook and YouTube
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:12.000]   and the parent companies of those. And they sued to block
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.440]   these two laws. Justice Kagan, a liberal wrote the unanimous
[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:18.320]   decision, obviously no dissensions here. And the
[00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:20.640]   majority held the editorial judgment and the curation of
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:23.440]   other people's speech is a unique expressive product of
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:27.360]   its own, which entitles it to First Amendment protection. So
[00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:29.280]   just to give you an example, if you wanted to create a social
[00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:31.840]   network, we can't be anonymous like LinkedIn, you can do that.
[00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:34.000]   If you want to do something like Twitter x and have anonymous
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   accounts, you can do that as well. If you want to create a
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.200]   social network with adult content, you can do it. Or like
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:42.080]   Zack is doing on threats. Interestingly, they are down
[00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:44.640]   playing political content, obviously other platforms
[00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:51.600]   amplify political content. So let me and so the end of all
[00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:54.960]   this in terms of how the court handled it is, they offered some
[00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:57.760]   guidance and sent the cases back to the lower courts to clarify
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:00.960]   a bunch of stuff. Just to keep this brief. Chamath, what are
[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:04.400]   your thoughts on this? Obviously, some of the ideas
[00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:08.720]   here, like letting users know why they were banned or why
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:11.520]   content was taken down. I think the overwhelming majority of
[00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:14.000]   users would like to have that. But is this the government's
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.840]   role? I'm not enough of a legal scholar to know the details of
[00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:23.520]   this case, except to say that when the entire court goes in
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:27.520]   one direction, it's probably because this never should have
[00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:29.280]   been brought to the court in the first place. And they're
[00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:32.640]   giving a very clear message. It wasn't even ideologically
[00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:35.680]   strained to figure out what the right answer should be. So,
[00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:39.760]   Saks, obviously, your chosen party was the one who brought
[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:42.800]   this, you have concerns about the platforms doing this. But do
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:45.840]   you have equal concerns about the government, then I guess,
[00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:49.280]   being the ones who have to enforce these? Is this a good
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:53.600]   ruling? Well, I think that with respect to the Texas and
[00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:56.160]   Florida laws, I think their heart was in the right place,
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:58.560]   they were motivated by the right things, which was to reduce
[00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:01.760]   censorship on the social media platforms, specifically
[00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:04.800]   censorship of conservatives, which is to say they're, they're
[00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:10.160]   citizens. But those laws probably were overly broad. And
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:14.320]   they infringed on the free speech of corporations, because
[00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:16.880]   I guess corporations get free speech, too. And basically,
[00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:20.000]   what the ruling says is that content moderation receives the
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.680]   same First Amendment protections as any other kind of speech. So
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:27.920]   the decisions of what content you're going to keep up or take
[00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:33.200]   down on your own property, is itself a speech decision. And
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:35.920]   the government has to respect that. So that's what the ruling
[00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:38.720]   here was saying. I think it's not a bad decision. I wish the
[00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:41.920]   Supreme Court, however, had coupled this with a better
[00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:46.160]   decision in the Missouri versus Biden case, which they, they
[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:48.160]   basically said that the plaintiffs lack standing to
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:51.920]   pursue. So they didn't necessarily give a dispositive
[00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:55.280]   ruling in that case, but they threw it, they threw it out. And
[00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:58.560]   and basically, what that case was about was the Biden
[00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:02.080]   administration was engaged in attempts to influence or
[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:05.680]   pressure social media companies to take down speech as a
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:09.920]   practice known as jawboning. And I wish they had coupled this
[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:14.160]   decision with a better decision in in Missouri versus Biden
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:16.880]   saying the government's not allowed to coerce social
[00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:20.000]   networks to take down speech either. And they refuse to do
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.680]   that. So I wouldn't say these are like the greatest set of
[00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:27.040]   decisions with regard to free speech that the courts ever
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:30.560]   done. I hope that they will come back in the future. Once
[00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:33.440]   they find a plaintiff with the right standing to address that
[00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:35.520]   issue. Yeah, that's a key issue. Freeberger thoughts.
[00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:38.800]   Yeah. So I've said for a long time, we've obviously had
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:42.880]   conversations about Twitter and shadow banning and some of the
[00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:45.600]   other activities on what are typically called social media
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:48.560]   platforms. At the end of the day, these are all as I've
[00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:51.440]   shared in the past, my belief is they're all content companies,
[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:55.680]   they have a choice as executives and it's editors of
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:58.480]   those companies to decide how to editorialize the content on
[00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:01.440]   their platforms. They can choose to create content with
[00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:04.480]   writers that they pay on staff, like a newspaper might, they
[00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:07.200]   can choose to create content with actors and directors that
[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:11.200]   they pay to create novel video series for them like HBO might,
[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:15.040]   or they can choose to make content creation available to
[00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:18.720]   third parties that don't get paid like users. And at the end
[00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:21.200]   of the day, what they choose to do with that content and how
[00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:24.080]   they choose to display that content is up to them as an
[00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:27.120]   editorial platform that is ultimately creating content for
[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:30.080]   other consumers. I don't view that user generated content
[00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:34.800]   platforms are a right of the consumers to have access to
[00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:37.360]   share their thoughts. They have the internet to do that. And
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:39.680]   they have many other places that they can go to, to create
[00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:42.880]   blogs, to create websites to do whatever else they want to do
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:46.320]   to express themselves. But to have a technological platform
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:49.360]   that lets them submit content, that then the editors get to
[00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:52.160]   decide how and where they show that content. I think they
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:54.240]   should understand because it's in the terms and conditions
[00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:56.640]   when you sign up. So I don't believe in social media
[00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:59.680]   platforms as utilities. And I don't think that the government
[00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:03.040]   should have any role in deciding what is or isn't on those
[00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:06.480]   platforms. This goes both ways. I think that the company should
[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:09.440]   decide what kind of platforms they want to have, whether they
[00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:12.960]   want to have free speech that allows inappropriate content,
[00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:15.840]   or content that might be offensive, or whether they want
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:18.000]   to have a highly moderated platform to make it more
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.880]   broadly available or appealing to users, it's entirely up to
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:24.000]   them. And I really do appreciate the ruling, because I think
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.080]   that the government should have less of a role in intervening
[00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:28.640]   and deciding how media companies create content and how they
[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:29.760]   editorialize that content.
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:33.040]   Yeah, so I think that's well said. And I was in the same sort
[00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:36.160]   of camp as you freeberg, which is like a battle of snowflakes
[00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:38.480]   here, like, the liberals, obviously, we're canceling
[00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:41.200]   people on these platforms. And now like the bag of folks want
[00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:43.360]   to come in and have the government regulated. If you
[00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:46.720]   want to compete here, just create a new product or service
[00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:49.760]   in the market, you're on the board of rumble sacks, like
[00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:52.720]   they're doing really well. And if you squeeze too tight, and
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:55.680]   your platform doesn't work, it's the marketplace should, you
[00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:59.840]   know, figure out who the winners are. And you know, it's it's not
[00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:02.560]   a situation where you want the government getting in there,
[00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:05.440]   because then they're going to go to a newspaper. And there's so
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:08.640]   much precedent here. You know, I actually read some of the of
[00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:10.880]   these rulings, which is really interesting. They're written
[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:13.280]   phenomenally well, I will put in the show notes, the actual
[00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:16.000]   links to the PDFs of these decisions, they're well worth
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.240]   reading. And in this case, they brought up a bunch of the
[00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:23.920]   previous law was fascinating, like people wanted to force a
[00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:28.960]   newspaper to allow you know, one candidate to reply and give
[00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:30.720]   him space. They were like, No, you can't do that. It's their
[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:33.360]   newspaper, they decide what they publish. Another person
[00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:37.200]   wanted to have a corporate newsletter be forced to give
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:39.680]   information about the other sides. You just don't get to do
[00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:42.160]   that. I'll just say one more thing. What else is striking is
[00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:45.520]   just how insular and protectionist Texas and Florida
[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:48.560]   are being. And it's not just with this law. It's also with
[00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:51.040]   the lab grown meat or cultivated meat laws that they've passed
[00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:53.920]   and other states are passing similar laws, which is limiting
[00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:56.480]   innovation in the state and limiting freedom to operate in
[00:42:56.480 --> 00:43:00.080]   the state in order to protect interests of individuals and
[00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:02.720]   corporations that already exist within that state. So it's
[00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:05.760]   really important to note this isn't a good or a bad thing. But
[00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:08.240]   those states are operating in a way the lawmakers of those
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:10.720]   states are operating in a way that's trying to protect the
[00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:13.360]   interests of the individuals and businesses in the state over
[00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:16.080]   the freedoms that might and the liberties that might otherwise
[00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:17.840]   be available. And I think we often talk about these states
[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:20.880]   being more free, but these laws and the cultivated meat ban laws
[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:23.680]   in my opinion, indicate that these states are actually on the
[00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:27.040]   contrary. They're much more kind of protectionist. Where's your
[00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:30.080]   take on that sex to free birds point? I mean, I think this,
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:32.480]   this ruling might have been necessary from a constitutional
[00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:36.240]   standpoint, because corporations do have free speech rights. But
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:39.440]   again, I would say that I think that the laws of Texas and
[00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:42.240]   Florida are coming from a good place, which is they were trying
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:45.440]   to protect the rights of their citizens to engage in free
[00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:48.320]   speech. I think it's just unfortunate that in this case,
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:52.080]   it's a zero sum game. And as a result, those laws were
[00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:54.480]   invalidated. I think that makes sense. But I still think we have
[00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:55.040]   a problem.
[00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:58.080]   I agree with you, the platforms have too much power. What is
[00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:01.040]   your proposed solution? You obviously don't want to have the
[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:03.360]   government in there, like running a newsroom or running
[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:05.760]   Twitter x, because you yourself were saying, hey, the
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:09.440]   government's too involved in x and these platforms and doing
[00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:13.440]   this job owning. So obviously, having the more involved is bad,
[00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:14.960]   right? You're against them being involved.
[00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:17.360]   Yeah, I think it's really tricky to figure out how to solve
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:20.800]   this. God, I think for one thing, you don't want the
[00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:23.280]   government job owning these sites to take down content that
[00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:26.000]   clearly should be a free speech violation. I'm disappointed the
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:26.880]   court didn't get to that.
[00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:30.160]   I think we're totally missing the bigger picture. There's like
[00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:34.160]   a lot of fear mongering that I think has happened with respect
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:38.560]   to the Supreme Court, and that it's all of a sudden become
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:45.280]   some super ideological, super rigid, super activist place. And
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:48.560]   I think it's, in fact, much of the opposite, and the data
[00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:51.360]   supports that. And so I think it's important for people to
[00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:54.880]   know that what's actually happening is that many of these
[00:44:54.880 --> 00:45:00.000]   decisions are very much split along non ideological lines. And
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.240]   I think that that's an important thing. So I just like I'm
[00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:04.320]   pulling this up, and I just want to read some of these things to
[00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:09.120]   you. US versus Rahimi, which is a federal law that prohibits
[00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:13.040]   people subjected to domestic violence, restraining orders
[00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:16.160]   from having a firearm. That was an eight to one decision were
[00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:19.120]   all but Thomas supported that makes a lot of sense, you would
[00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:23.440]   think racial gerrymandering, that was more ideological, where
[00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:26.720]   it was a conservative bloc versus Sotomayor, Brown and
[00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:30.400]   Kagan, Trump, the Anderson, which is Trump getting back on
[00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:36.640]   the Colorado ballot nine. Oh, FDA versus the Alliance for
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:39.920]   Hippocratic Medicine, which was access to the abortion pill,
[00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:46.080]   nine, zero, maintaining access. Moyle versus us, which is
[00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:49.040]   whether Idaho strict abortion law conflicts with the federal
[00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:53.520]   law, non ideological, where it was Gorsuch, Alito, Thomas, and
[00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:57.280]   Katanji, Brown, Jackson, who descended. So it goes on and on.
[00:45:57.280 --> 00:45:59.440]   And I think what's so interesting about all of this is
[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:03.680]   that I had thought that this was not like what it was, what I
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:06.640]   thought what had happened is, Trump's track, the Supreme
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:10.400]   Court, all of a sudden, we are ripping all these laws apart,
[00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:15.600]   this long standing sort of doctrine of what has passed. But
[00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:18.160]   yet, I think what's actually happening is people are pretty
[00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:23.280]   thoughtfully pushing the responsibility to the states. And
[00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:26.800]   I think that the court's decisions are relatively
[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:29.440]   unpredictable, in the sense that it's not just a conservative
[00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:32.880]   bloc versus a liberal bloc. I think that's the real story. And
[00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:35.920]   when you unpack a bunch of these decisions in that context,
[00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:39.440]   that's what's so interesting to me is like, these are pretty
[00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:41.920]   nuanced decisions that get at the heart of a lot of key
[00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:45.200]   important issues happening across non ideological lines,
[00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:48.080]   Jan six, one Katanji, Brown, Jackson was the Biden appointee
[00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:50.960]   that basically supported this thing that may throw out 200
[00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:53.600]   plus convictions for Jan six, and Amy Coney Bare was on the
[00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:55.760]   other side. This is an unpredictable Supreme Court. I
[00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:58.400]   think they think for themselves, they seem to be independent.
[00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:01.760]   And I think they're coming to their own conclusions. That's
[00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:03.760]   the only thing to take away from the distribution of the
[00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:06.480]   votes that should make people feel a little bit better.
[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:09.360]   So I think this next ruling is the most important one. And I
[00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:12.160]   think will be the most important one that we've seen with this
[00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:18.560]   new court that has three of the nine justices placed by Trump to
[00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:23.280]   your point Chamath. And this one is seismic, the looper versus
[00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:26.960]   Raimondo decision overturned Chevron. Okay, so this one takes
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:29.840]   a little explaining the court overruled a landmark 1984
[00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:35.280]   decision in the Chevron case from 40 years ago. For context,
[00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:38.640]   the original ruling created the Chevron doctrine where the
[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:42.000]   government and federal courts generally defer to the stances
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:45.280]   of federal agencies unless Congress has written specific
[00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:48.640]   laws on an issue. The 1984 ruling upheld the EPA's
[00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:52.000]   interpretation of the Clean Air Act. It's very influential.
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:55.520]   This has been cited by federal courts over 18,000 times in 40
[00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:58.480]   years, it was overruled in another six to three decision
[00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:02.000]   where the justices voted along party lines from basically the
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.480]   shift power back to federal judges and courts instead of
[00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:07.840]   administrative agency staffed by experts, academics, all that
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:12.080]   kind of stuff. In the majority opinion, Roberts conservative
[00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:15.280]   obviously, said the Chevron doctrine violates the
[00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:17.360]   Administrative Procedures Act of federal law that directs the
[00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:19.760]   courts to review actions taken by federal agencies. He also
[00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:22.000]   pointed out that the courts are regularly expected to deal with
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.320]   technical questions. So this should not be considered beyond
[00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:27.120]   their ability to scope. Kagan, a liberal wrote a critical
[00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:29.200]   dissent. She said the agency staff with scientists and
[00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:31.680]   experts are more likely to have the expertise to make these
[00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:34.960]   decisions rather than the judges. She also pointed out
[00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:37.520]   that the system had been functioning for 40 years. And
[00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:40.640]   this ruling will create a massive quote jolt to the legal
[00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:43.440]   system. Chamath get in there. Do you remember when President
[00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:48.160]   Biden tried to pass the budget two years ago, and he was one
[00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:52.480]   vote short. And Joe Manchin ended up putting it over the top.
[00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:57.360]   But he negotiated what was a redo of a bunch of regulation.
[00:48:57.360 --> 00:49:01.360]   And he was promised that there would be this regulatory
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:05.600]   overhaul that happened. And that was sort of why he had
[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:09.360]   decided to vote for that budget bill, it ended up not
[00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:13.440]   happening. So the reason why I think he had saw that and he
[00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:17.040]   discussed this is that there are so many businesses that now
[00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:20.880]   suffer from the regulations of these agencies, because when the
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:24.240]   agency enacted that regulation, it was just a different time and
[00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:29.440]   place. And there was no clean way to go back to an independent
[00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:34.240]   body and say, I understand what your intention was in 1985,
[00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:38.160]   when you wrote that regulation. But in 2024, things have
[00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:43.360]   changed. Can we reconsider and basically what the courts have
[00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:47.440]   done now will allow companies who believe that regulations
[00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:52.080]   are either overwrought or misguided. For today's market
[00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:56.240]   landscape, bring it to an independent judiciary and have
[00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:59.440]   them decide. And I think that that's a very reasonable check
[00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:02.480]   and balance. And I think that's, that makes a lot of sense.
[00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:05.920]   Folks can pass laws. And if folks believe that those laws do
[00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:10.160]   you undo harm, now you have a mechanism to go and actually
[00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:13.440]   explain your case to somebody independent who can then make a
[00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:16.000]   judgment. I think that that's a good check and balance.
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.240]   freeburg. I knew this was the one you most wanted to talk
[00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:23.600]   about. What's your take on this end of the age of experts and
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:25.760]   throwing things back to the court? What will be the
[00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:29.040]   practical ramifications? I don't know how much experience you
[00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:34.000]   guys have had dealing with federal regulators, you have a
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:37.760]   lot more than I think. Yeah. And I've worked in a lot across a
[00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:41.200]   number of federal agencies in businesses I've been involved
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:45.520]   in. And I can tell you, it is, as I'm sure you would expect,
[00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:49.360]   there's a lot of bureaucratic morass in, in these agencies.
[00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:52.640]   And if you think about it, it's because the agencies are
[00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:56.880]   effectively under the Chevron doctrine, vested unlimited
[00:50:56.880 --> 00:51:01.200]   authority to create rules and regulations that they then
[00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:05.120]   determine are meant to represent the laws that were passed by
[00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:08.800]   Congress. But more often than not, those rules and regulations
[00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:13.600]   begin to bleed outside of the lines of the intention of the
[00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:17.920]   laws when they were passed. And this is because those agencies
[00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:21.280]   by creating new rules and regulations, this isn't this
[00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:25.040]   isn't some like, you know, I have a subversive reason for
[00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:28.960]   doing this, but these agencies have an incentive for creating
[00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:31.520]   more rules and regulations, because they then get to go back
[00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:35.840]   to Congress and ask for more budget and hire more people and
[00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:39.680]   grow the importance and the scale of their agency. This is
[00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:43.200]   the natural kind of organic growth that arises in any
[00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:46.560]   living system. And any organization of individuals is
[00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:49.760]   also a living system and has the same incentive. It wants to
[00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:52.480]   have more resources, it wants to get bigger, it wants to do
[00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:55.760]   more stuff, it wants to be more important. And the Chevron
[00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:59.920]   doctrine has allowed agencies to operate independent and
[00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:02.800]   outside of the lines that were defined in the laws that were
[00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:06.080]   passed, that that then vested them this authority, that then
[00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:07.920]   they can go and say, I want more budget, I want to get
[00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:12.960]   bigger. And I'm optimistic that this ruling will limit the
[00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:16.480]   agency's authorities and limit their ability to create more
[00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:20.560]   bureaucratic overhead, more headcount, more individuals
[00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:23.440]   that need to now go and administer the rules and
[00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:26.560]   regulations that they themselves create. And so I'm
[00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:29.760]   actually very optimistic and hopeful about this, this
[00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:32.880]   change. Now, the downside, the negative to this, is that there
[00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:37.360]   are a number of really important regulatory roles that
[00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:41.280]   agencies have come to play that never got passed as bills, like
[00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:45.120]   environmental protection rules. And there's a negative
[00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:48.080]   consequence that will arise to some degree, with respect to
[00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:50.560]   health of the environment, health of people, etc. But I
[00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:54.080]   think net net, Congress needs to do its job, it needs to go
[00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:56.960]   back to session, and it needs to sit down and needs to pass
[00:52:56.960 --> 00:53:00.080]   laws that really clearly define what is and what isn't going to
[00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:02.880]   be legal going forward. And then the agencies operate
[00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:05.840]   strictly within those bounds. So to recap, it could get a
[00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:09.120]   little messy, but it's better, healthier system, because this
[00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:13.040]   system has become super bloated over 40 years. That was my take
[00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:15.920]   on it as well. sacks, what's your take on this? This feels
[00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:18.560]   like a huge win to me. What do you know?
[00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:21.440]   Oh, I agree with that. And I agree with what freeberg said,
[00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:24.480]   look, when when this decision, the Chevron decision came down
[00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:28.160]   in 1984, at the height of the Reagan Revolution, conservatives
[00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:31.600]   actually liked it, they praised it, because we were coming off
[00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:36.240]   a period of an activist court, you know, the Warren Court, and
[00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:39.200]   they thought that shifting power from the courts, the agencies
[00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:41.680]   would actually be a good move. Well, it turns out it completely
[00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:45.520]   backfired. Whichever one it came out was not a widely noticed
[00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:49.760]   decision since then has been cited 18,000 times by federal
[00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:52.400]   courts has turned out to be enormously important and
[00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:56.080]   influential. And the reason for all those citations is it's the
[00:53:56.080 --> 00:53:59.440]   courts deferring to the rulemaking of an agency, you
[00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:01.920]   know, what Chevron basically says is, as long as the
[00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:05.600]   agency's interpretation is reasonable, or you could say not
[00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:08.640]   unreasonable, then the agency can basically promulgate the
[00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:12.960]   rule. And what this has led to is an orgy of rulemaking by all
[00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:17.520]   these federal agencies. And so most of our laws now
[00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:20.640]   effectively are being made by unelected bureaucrats who are
[00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:23.520]   part of this three letter alphabet soup of government
[00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:26.480]   agencies. It's not the Congress, it's not the court, it's not the
[00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:29.520]   president. It's this fourth branch of government that's not
[00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:33.040]   in the Constitution, which is the administrative state. And so
[00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:36.160]   the administrative state has become incredibly powerful as
[00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:40.160]   a result of Chevron doctrine. And now I think by reversing it,
[00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:44.320]   you actually give a chance for the restoration of democracy.
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:47.680]   Basically, the agencies are not empowered to essentially make
[00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:50.400]   whatever rules they want, as long as they superficially
[00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:54.000]   appear reasonable, they actually have to show that their rules
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:58.400]   are within a statute that they were directed by Congress to
[00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:01.040]   effectively engage in the rulemaking. So this is a step in
[00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:03.440]   the right direction for sure. But again, the real problem here
[00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:05.600]   is reigning in this unelected administrative state.
[00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:08.560]   Yeah, come up any final thoughts here as we move on to
[00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:09.040]   the next one.
[00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:13.760]   Seems like the Supreme Court is doing a great job.
[00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:15.520]   I agree.
[00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:18.640]   All nine of them. I mean, they really, they really seem to be
[00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:22.320]   doing a tremendous job. I give them a lot of credit.
[00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:25.200]   I feel like I've become a conservative. Maybe I'm a
[00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:28.160]   conservative now, sex. I don't know, I may have to sit down and
[00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:31.200]   confess to you. Because I read a number of these decisions. And
[00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:33.280]   I was like, I agree, I agree. And this is supposed to be a
[00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:34.800]   conservative court. So I'm not sure.
[00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:38.480]   Well, it's actually it's not, it's not an originalist court.
[00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:40.400]   It's not a conservative court. This is what I'm saying. Like
[00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:43.280]   these are words that are planted by people that want you to
[00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:47.760]   believe their version of the lie. Great. So there are a lot
[00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:50.720]   of originalists on the court. And what the originalists
[00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:53.920]   doctrine says, and sacks, you can correct me is I read the
[00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:56.800]   Constitution with faith and fidelity, and I just see what
[00:55:56.800 --> 00:56:00.560]   it's what it says, not I interpret it, not I fill in the
[00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:04.160]   words, I just, what it says is what we're allowed. And I think
[00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:08.000]   that there's some, there's a really good version of America
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:09.120]   in that view of the world.
[00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:12.400]   Yeah, I mean, I would say it's not even necessarily an
[00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:15.600]   originalist or conservative court. It's a 333 court, meaning
[00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:17.600]   there's three conservatives, there's three liberals, there's
[00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:20.960]   three justice in the middle, you have this middle block, led by
[00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:23.840]   the Chief Justice Roberts with Kavanaugh and Barrett, and then
[00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:28.240]   you got the conservatives with Gorsuch and Thomas and Alito.
[00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:31.280]   And sometimes the middle block goes with the liberals, sometimes
[00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:33.600]   it goes with the conservatives. Again, it's more of like a
[00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:37.120]   triangle. And as we know, the triangle is the best shape for
[00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:40.240]   equipoise, right? Because it creates balance. And I think
[00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:42.480]   what we have right now is a balanced court. And I think on
[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:45.520]   the whole, they've done a good job. And I think it's kind of
[00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:49.040]   sad that in reaction to some of these decisions, you've got
[00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:51.360]   powerful lawmakers like Elizabeth Warren, who are
[00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:54.800]   explicitly calling for packing in the court. They're actually
[00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:57.520]   saying, you know, put a bunch of justice on here to ruin this
[00:56:57.520 --> 00:57:00.720]   equipoise that we have. I think it's really sad. I think that
[00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:03.360]   the court right now is one of the last highly functional
[00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:07.600]   institutions in American public life. And for elected leaders to
[00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:10.400]   be calling for its destruction is just sad.
[00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:14.320]   Well, I you know, I think what here and here's an image from
[00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:18.480]   Axio showing, you know, six Republican nominated and three
[00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:22.240]   Democrat nominated, I think, to give the counter argument, you
[00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:25.360]   know, Roe v. Wade, being overturned was something the
[00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:28.000]   majority of the country didn't want. These three people were
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:33.200]   added for that explicit purpose by Trump, people have trauma,
[00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:37.280]   pain over that reasonably, I think. And then the truth is,
[00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:41.280]   though, if they are, you know, just one standard deviation
[00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:45.040]   here, as you can see in this Axios chart, which is based on
[00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:48.640]   some data, I don't I don't trust this chart. I think this chart
[00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:50.800]   is worthless, Jason, I think. Well, let me explain to you
[00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:53.200]   what actual articles No, but I'm saying no, no, look at the
[00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:57.040]   actual you don't even know what it is. If you look at my point
[00:57:57.040 --> 00:57:59.120]   is this is meaningless. A child could have drawn this. It means
[00:57:59.120 --> 00:58:02.480]   nothing. No, no, a child didn't draw it. This was how do you
[00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:05.680]   know? I'm reading because I'm reading the sources. I'm reading
[00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:07.920]   the source of the data. This is based on something called the
[00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:10.880]   Martin Quinn score and analysis by political scientists, Andrew
[00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:14.000]   Martin, Kevin Quinn, known as the Martin Quinn score places
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:17.120]   judges on an idea lecture, ideological spectrum, a lower
[00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:20.000]   score indicates a more liberal justice, or a high score
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:23.200]   indicates a more conservative justice. And then they went
[00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:26.880]   through all of their decisions. You're saying a subjective
[00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:29.920]   classifier, a subjective classifier is created by these
[00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:33.120]   two random people. And you're not regurgitating the score like
[00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:36.560]   it means something. No, I think it's an interesting way. It's an
[00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:39.760]   interesting chart to discuss to understand a little bit of
[00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:43.360]   their meanings. What I would encourage anybody to do is to
[00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:48.000]   look at the actual substance of the decisions, and the votes and
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:51.680]   what you will see is that people are not as easily predictable as
[00:58:51.680 --> 00:58:53.920]   that chart would show. And I think that's what's important.
[00:58:53.920 --> 00:59:00.960]   Okay. I think that chart supports exactly what you just
[00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:02.320]   said, sacks, right? Yeah.
[00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:07.600]   I mean, not exactly. I mean, again, I view it as a 333 court,
[00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:09.280]   a lot of other people have written about that. And they've
[00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:11.600]   got their own diagrams and charts to show that look, I
[00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:14.880]   think it's a court, like I said, in equipoise, I don't think it's
[00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:18.640]   partisan, I think it's it's been reasonably fair. I don't agree
[00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:21.360]   with every single ruling. Like I said, I would have liked to
[00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:25.520]   seen a different result in Biden v. Missouri. However, I think on
[00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:27.280]   the whole, they're doing a good job. And it really should be a
[00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:32.000]   scandal that you've got powerful lawmakers explicitly calling for
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:35.280]   the court to be passed. I mean, that would be a disaster, right?
[00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:37.920]   Because you have nine justices, which is a good number, you try
[00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:40.960]   to increase that to 13. Then the next time the republicans have
[00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:44.080]   control, they're going to increase it to 15, or 21, or
[00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:46.480]   whatever. And pretty soon, we're gonna have 100 justices on the
[00:59:46.480 --> 00:59:50.160]   court, you'll ruin it. You know, really, nine justices should be
[00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:53.360]   a constitutional requirement, we should fix it at nine and not
[00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:57.360]   mess with that. So it's just scandalous to me that you've got
[00:59:57.360 --> 01:00:01.760]   politicians who are reacting to reasonable decisions by saying
[01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:03.040]   that we need to pack the court.
[01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:05.440]   Okay, quick hit here. This is an important story for you.
[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:08.160]   Chamath Scott has also agreed to hear a case on the limits of
[01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:11.040]   online porn in its next term, which starts in October.
[01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:16.640]   Will it will it impact incognito mode? Because if it is
[01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:18.000]   that, yeah, just
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.640]   you're in trouble.
[01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:26.480]   I just I think there's a, are you?
[01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:30.000]   Could you imagine if they banned incognito mode?
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:34.160]   I think you might want to do a deep dive into how incognito
[01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:38.000]   incognito mode is you may want to get a VP. I'm pretty sure
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.680]   Texas is going to ban incognito.
[01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:45.920]   Texas and Florida, I think a couple of these sites because of
[01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:51.280]   the threat of, you know, this, these laws of age gating, they've
[01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:55.520]   just decided to wholesale leave certain states by IP address.
[01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:59.600]   Therefore, the sale of VPNs in Texas went up because when you
[01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:01.840]   went to certain porn sites, I said, hey, because of Texas is
[01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:05.840]   proposing these laws, we're not going to allow you to visit this
[01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:09.520]   website, Nick, do the NBC thing, the more you know, the more
[01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:14.720]   okay, let's go disagree to hear a case on the limits of online
[01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:18.400]   porn in its next term, which starts in October, the long
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:21.360]   question was passed by Texas legislature in 2023 requires
[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:24.720]   porn sites to verify the age of their users and restrict access
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:27.600]   for minors. It seems reasonable Fifth Circuit Court in New
[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:29.760]   Orleans upheld the law sending it to the Supreme Court if
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:32.640]   upheld users would have to submit personal info that
[01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:36.720]   verifies that over 18 to watch porn. The law is opposed by the
[01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:39.680]   ACLU and the free speech coalition, which is a trade
[01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:42.000]   group representing adult entertainers and companies they
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.960]   argue it places an undue burden on adults wishing to access
[01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:48.000]   constantly protected free expression. Oh, speaking of
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:54.000]   porn and its related businesses. The Rick's cabaret recession
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.720]   index is back on you guys see this? It was published on
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:02:00.160]   Twitter. So Rick's cabaret is a collection of public strip
[01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:04.320]   clubs. And and what's interesting about the Rick's
[01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:08.160]   cabaret stock price is that it has presaged the last two
[01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:11.760]   recessions when whenever the stock dives, people people have
[01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:15.440]   said it actually predicts an upcoming recession and the
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:19.840]   stock just you know, puked up like 25 or 30% in the last
[01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:26.400]   week. There it is. So people do not have the cheddar to go to
[01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:32.480]   the cabaret and go splashy cash. It's called it's called
[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:36.080]   Rick's cabaret. But the strip club index says recessions is
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:41.120]   on the offer. I prefer cabaret. It's more charming. All right,
[01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:44.720]   so surprise you're not discussing the immunity case.
[01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:48.640]   That's the one that all the pundits I made it I made it last
[01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:54.960]   I'll counter the Rick's cabaret recession indicator as valid
[01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:57.600]   anymore based on the theory of our good friend on the group
[01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:00.320]   chat, who I think has done a very good job highlighting that
[01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:03.760]   the strip club industry has been decimated by only fans. As a
[01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:06.560]   result, Rick's cabaret is more likely down because of only
[01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:13.840]   fans and the lack of shall we say, employee base available to
[01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:16.080]   work in these establishments because they make more money
[01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:19.680]   working online and only fans now. That was a theory post
[01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:21.440]   posited by one of our good friends.
[01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:24.240]   But you got to think that that showed up in the data at least
[01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:27.680]   a year or two years ago, no? Because how long has only fans
[01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:28.880]   been around a long time, I'm guessing.
[01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:32.080]   Well, but I think it peaked during COVID because you know,
[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:34.960]   you couldn't go to a cabaret if you wanted to take in a cabaret
[01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:39.680]   show and have a, you know, a bottle of champagne at a cabaret
[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:44.800]   show, you can do it. So you're the thesis of our friend is the
[01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:48.400]   thesis of our friend entertainers. Yeah, only fans
[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:51.440]   took all the entertainers out of the strip club industry
[01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:54.800]   because they make more money online, right cab range, the
[01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:57.920]   cabaret industry, I'm sorry, please edit that Nick. And as a
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:01.520]   result, the quality of the product at the cabaret business
[01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:04.560]   has declined. And as a result, revenue has declined. It took a
[01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:07.440]   little bit of time to earn that in. So so the virtual cabaret
[01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:09.920]   industry, our friends theory, we give them a big shout out, we
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:14.160]   will. Yeah, shout out to a book called the beep theory. Yeah,
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:19.120]   the beep theory. So the the elite cabaret artists can make
[01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:23.840]   more money on only fans that go there. And then that leaves the
[01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:31.840]   less refined artists. Why it's so good. So pure, I'm trying to
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:34.960]   navigate this and not get labeled. Saks, where are you on
[01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:35.760]   this? What's your opinion?
[01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:45.760]   So anyway, so far 16 red states have passed or agreed to pass
[01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:48.720]   each game Jake has got a dunder Mifflin index of whatever.
[01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:53.120]   Sorry, I couldn't hear you guys are laughing too quick. Say it
[01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:57.520]   again. Cut out. You had the dunder Mifflin score of x, y, z
[01:04:57.520 --> 01:04:58.880]   nonsense.
[01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:06.480]   Hunter Mifflin. So quick check out Dr. Mifflin score.
[01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:13.920]   I don't understand the dunder Mifflin score. Didn't you know
[01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:17.280]   is that from the office? I don't watch the office. Oh, okay.
[01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:20.000]   Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. What is wrong with you? You would never
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.800]   got into it. I never got into it. But yeah, probably watched
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:25.440]   it like for that's the paper company where they work. Yeah.
[01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:28.720]   Yeah. Apparently, we've had a huge victory for Trump in the
[01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:32.800]   immunity case. Trump sued in this case based on special
[01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:37.520]   counsel Jack Smith's prosecution of Trump for alleged attempts
[01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:41.520]   to overturn the 2020 election and his role in January six, if
[01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:45.200]   you don't remember that case. Since there's so many cases
[01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:48.800]   against Trump. This was based on Trump pressuring Mike Pence to
[01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:52.640]   not certify the election his phone call to get the 11,780
[01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:57.440]   votes that were missing in Georgia or Giuliani and the
[01:05:57.440 --> 01:06:00.000]   whack pack trying to fake electorates to overturn the
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:03.680]   election. Trump argued that he should be immune from
[01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:06.960]   prosecution for acts committed while he was president. So go
[01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:11.760]   to ruled six, three, along party lines, that former presidents
[01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:15.360]   can't face prosecution for actions that related to core
[01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:20.080]   powers of their office, office, and official official, official
[01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:26.160]   core powers of their office and that all official acts receive
[01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:29.920]   at least the broad presumption of immunity. Here's the quote
[01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:32.800]   under our constitutional structure of separated powers,
[01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:36.080]   the nature of presidential power entitles former president
[01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:39.120]   to absolute immunity for criminal prosecution for actions
[01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:42.960]   within his conclusive and preclusive constitutional
[01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:46.400]   authority and he is entitled to at least presumptive immunity
[01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:49.760]   from prosecution for all his official acts. There is no
[01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:53.760]   immunity for unofficial acts that would be outside the duty
[01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:57.040]   of the President's Chief Justice Roberts emphasized that
[01:06:57.040 --> 01:06:59.840]   decision that the decision doesn't necessarily mean
[01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:03.920]   presidents are above the law. In her dissenting opinion, Justice
[01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:07.280]   Sotomayor wrote that under the new ruling, criminal law can't
[01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:11.040]   be applied to presidents even if they misuse their office for
[01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:13.920]   personal gain. She wrote that if the President orders the Navy
[01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:16.800]   SEAL Team six to assassinate a political rival, he is now
[01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:19.280]   insulated from criminal prosecution. Another quote, the
[01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:22.800]   President is now a king above the law. She closed with this
[01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:26.560]   line, with fear for our democracy, I dissent. Notably,
[01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:28.960]   this breaks the tradition of closing with I respectfully
[01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:32.000]   dissent. So Trump's attempts to overturn the election results
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:35.920]   case now hinges on whether Trump's conduct was private, or
[01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:40.480]   related to his official duty. For example, the lower courts
[01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:43.280]   now have to determine when Trump pressured Pence to not
[01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:47.200]   certify the election if that was an official business of being
[01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:50.480]   president or not, or when he called Georgia and said, Hey,
[01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:54.000]   can you find me 11,000 votes? Was that official duty? Or was
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:57.520]   it outside his duty? President Trump has already cited the
[01:07:57.520 --> 01:08:00.640]   immunity ruling in requesting a New York judge throw out his
[01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:04.400]   conviction in the hush money case, sentencing for that was
[01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:07.280]   pushed back from July 11, to September, because of this
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:10.720]   ruling sacks, there's you're running. Well, Jacob, what do
[01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:15.760]   you think? This is I'm really curious. I mean, I read the
[01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:21.600]   original the halfway through the the original PDF. And I do
[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:24.640]   think the President needs immunity, obviously for
[01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:28.400]   conducting business. And then I do think if they step outside
[01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:32.800]   the lines, they should not have immunity. And then the devil
[01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:36.320]   will be in the details here. And that's what courts and juries
[01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:39.920]   exist to do. So when I told Mike Pence to not certify the
[01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:44.560]   election, he's obviously not doing that as part of his duty
[01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:47.840]   as president, when he called Georgia to get the 11,000 votes,
[01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:50.640]   he was not doing that. That's why he had outside counsel
[01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:53.280]   there. That's why he hired Giuliani in the whack pack.
[01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:55.440]   What do you think? What do you think of Sotomayor's
[01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:58.720]   hypothetical of using SEAL Team six to kill a political rival?
[01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:01.840]   Well, I thought that that's, you think that he would be
[01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:03.680]   immune from process? Anybody would be immune from
[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:06.480]   prosecution for that? No, that seemed a little bit
[01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:10.480]   hysterical. And actually, that came up in the discussions. I
[01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:13.280]   actually listened to the audio version of this when they were
[01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:16.800]   doing the the q&a, basically. And I think you listened to it
[01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:20.080]   to Friedberg when I talked about it. So yeah, I think the
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:22.320]   devil will be in the details here and how they execute it.
[01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:26.160]   Obviously, you need to have immunity if you're going to, I
[01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:29.280]   don't know, take actions, you know, to assassinate Osama bin
[01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:34.240]   Laden, right, or whatever it is. But you know, it's it is a bit
[01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:38.640]   concerning this concept of being able to shield the
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:42.640]   president when he asks, I don't know the Attorney General to do
[01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:45.040]   something illegal. So these are the details that are going to
[01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:47.360]   need to be worked out here. And obviously, it's a split
[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:50.480]   decision. So the Supreme Court themselves can't agree on this.
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:52.880]   I think that there's just so much we don't know about what it
[01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:55.280]   takes to be the President of the United States. The example that
[01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:57.440]   I gave you guys in the group chat is like, look at the whole
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:01.360]   Iran contra fair. How complicated was that? Can any of
[01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:05.040]   us really understand what all of the interplay was when Ronald
[01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:10.400]   Reagan decides to work around a weapons embargo, sell weapons
[01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:16.240]   to Iran, take money, funnel it and fund the Sandinistas. In the
[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:18.960]   middle of all of that, there was a huge cocaine trade that was
[01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:24.000]   kind of enabled or supported. I mean, who How do we know, I
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.600]   think there's just a lot of latitude that you give to the
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:30.640]   one person that you elect to be president. And so maybe it's
[01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:33.440]   just a good reminder for all of us that we are electing one
[01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:36.320]   person, we cannot be electing five or six people, we're not
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:39.600]   electing a shadow cabinet, we're electing one person. And
[01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:42.320]   this is just a reminder of how much power that one person has.
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:44.880]   Zach, you have thoughts?
[01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:49.440]   I think this was an easy decision. All the majority did
[01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:53.440]   was codify explicitly what has long been presumed that
[01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:57.680]   presidents enjoy broad immunity for official acts that they
[01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:00.640]   undertake in the exercise of their constitutional authority
[01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:04.160]   and the duties of their office. It was established decades ago
[01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:08.160]   that presidents enjoy broad immunity from civil lawsuits.
[01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:11.200]   So it's already been the case that presidents can't be sued
[01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:15.200]   civilly. Well, criminal liability is even harder to
[01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:18.480]   prove. So if you have the broad immunity from civil, you should
[01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:22.080]   have broad immunity from criminal as well. And the Supreme
[01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:24.640]   Court, I think, had never ruled on criminal immunity, because
[01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:27.360]   they never had to know former presidents ever been subjected
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:30.240]   to the type of lawfare that's been deployed against Trump,
[01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:32.640]   who also happens to be the political opponent of the
[01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:36.320]   current president. So I think it's a shame that the Supreme
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:39.440]   Court has had to rule on this. Did they get every detail?
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:41.520]   Right? I don't know. I don't know what it means for the
[01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:45.040]   future. However, I know the reason they're doing it, which
[01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:48.400]   is we've had this unprecedented lawfare against Trump. And
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:50.720]   that's why they've been forced to do this. So ultimately, I
[01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:53.360]   think this is the right decision. No, it does not
[01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:56.080]   authorize drone strikes against the president's political
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:58.800]   enemies. That's insane. It does not make the president above
[01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:03.600]   the law or a king. And I think that Roberts, in his ruling,
[01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:06.960]   said the key things. He said that the dissent's position in
[01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:10.960]   the end boils down to ignoring the constitution's separation
[01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:15.520]   of powers and the court's precedent, and instead, fearmongers
[01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:19.280]   on the basis of extreme hypotheticals. And then he says
[01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:23.280]   that the dissents overlook the more likely prospect of an
[01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:26.240]   executive branch that cannibalizes itself with each
[01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:30.400]   successive president free to prosecute his predecessors, yet
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:34.240]   unable to boldly and fearlessly carry out his duties for fear
[01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:37.680]   that he may be next. I think that's really the key line here
[01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:42.000]   is that you're posing all these insane hypotheticals, instead
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:45.600]   of recognizing the practical reality that if you don't give
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:48.400]   presidents immunity, then the next president is going to
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:51.200]   prosecute the old president, and future presidents will be
[01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:54.880]   hamstrung in doing this very important job that's already
[01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:58.240]   difficult enough. So I think that this was just a necessary
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:02.160]   decision. There was no way around it. And the president
[01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:04.000]   already has civil immunity, you got to give him criminal
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:04.560]   immunity to.
[01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:07.760]   Freeberg, your thoughts, I guess the the steel man on the
[01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:11.520]   other side would be, you know, Trump doing things like calling
[01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:14.640]   Georgia and asking to find votes, or pressuring the
[01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:19.120]   president, the vice president to overturn the election results
[01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:22.720]   after 60 failed legal cases, you know, is what's concerning
[01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:25.440]   the other side. So do you have a take on it?
[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:30.080]   I think that the distinction between acting in their
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:34.640]   executive capacity as President of the United States
[01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:38.480]   versus their personal capacity as an individual candidate, or
[01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:43.760]   an individual that could benefit through some other means, is a
[01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:46.720]   really good distinction. I think how the courts ultimately
[01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:50.560]   adjudicate that distinction is what's still ahead. But I do
[01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:53.760]   think that the clarity of that distinction is critical. I it
[01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:56.560]   seems like the right thing, how this is going to play out with
[01:13:56.560 --> 01:13:59.440]   respect to election interference, does interfering in
[01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:04.240]   the election constitute one's role as an executive overseeing
[01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:08.480]   the federal election process? Or does it constitute one's
[01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:10.720]   personal benefits that may arise if one is individually
[01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:13.360]   elected is the key determinant that the lower court will
[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:16.320]   likely have to make? Maybe that gets kicked back up again in
[01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:20.560]   the future. If there's a disagreement over the decision
[01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:22.960]   that the court does make, with regards to that distinction.
[01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:25.920]   Where do you stand on that, Sax? You in previous episodes
[01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:28.240]   have said you didn't believe in this election interference, and
[01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:31.040]   you thought Trump lost. Have you changed your position on
[01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:32.720]   that? Or are you still in that position?
[01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:35.760]   That's totally irrelevant to the court's decision.
[01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:39.200]   Let me ask a follow up to that then. So in the case of, do you
[01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:42.160]   think Trump was acting officially when he asked Georgia
[01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:44.480]   to find the votes when he asked Pence to overturn the election?
[01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:46.560]   Or do you think he was acting in his duty?
[01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:49.680]   I think that that what you just described there is what's known
[01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:53.040]   as a question of fact. In the legal system, there are
[01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:56.160]   questions of law and questions of fact. And what the Supreme
[01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:59.600]   Court has done is given us a doctrine, they've answered the
[01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:01.600]   question of law, they've basically given us a three part
[01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:04.960]   test. They said that when the president acts within his
[01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:07.440]   exclusive constitutional authority, he gets broad
[01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:10.480]   immunity, when he does an official duty, but that's not in
[01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:13.360]   that category, he gets presumptive immunity, meaning
[01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:15.360]   that the prosecutor can still go after him, they just have to
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:18.800]   rebut the presumption. And when he engages in a personal act,
[01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:22.560]   there's no immunity. So look, what has to happen now is if
[01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:26.160]   Jack Smith wants to continue this prosecution of Trump, he's
[01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:29.280]   going to have to make the argument that Trump's acts were
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:33.600]   either personal, or were part of his duties, but he's going to
[01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:37.760]   rebut the presumption. So that is the now the question of fact
[01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:40.960]   that Jack Smith would have to litigate. And I'm not going to
[01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:43.680]   litigate it here. I don't know the answer to that. But again, I
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:45.840]   would separate questions of law and questions of fact what the
[01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:48.640]   Supreme Court has done, I think, has given us a useful
[01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:53.440]   doctrine that the presidency now needs in light of the reality
[01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:54.240]   of lawfare.
[01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:56.960]   So this is the one I think, Chamath, that is super
[01:15:56.960 --> 01:16:00.480]   fascinating, because I could see President Trump and his
[01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:04.240]   lawyer saying, Hey, very simple, you know, we think there was
[01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:07.600]   election interference. So yeah, we called Georgia to make sure
[01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:11.200]   that those 11,000 votes were there. And hey, you know, we
[01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:13.600]   thought this was not a fair election. So I was acting in my
[01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:17.360]   duty. And when I told Pence to not certify the election, I
[01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:18.960]   could see them making that argument. What do you think?
[01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:24.320]   I don't know the specifics of these cases. But I think it's
[01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:27.680]   going to force a prosecutor to have a really strong point of
[01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:31.760]   view and have evidence and then go after somebody. But again, I
[01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:35.680]   think you're focusing too much on Trump. Robert said in the
[01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:39.840]   decision, you have to look past the exigencies of the current
[01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:43.040]   moment. This is a set of rules that's about past presidents and
[01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:48.000]   future presidents. This is for forever. And so that's the most
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.160]   important thing here, which is there's a set of rules that I
[01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:53.200]   think we can all agree on, because the man that we all
[01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:57.120]   elect, dutifully elect is the most powerful person in the
[01:16:57.120 --> 01:17:01.520]   world. We knew it before. We know it now. So even more
[01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:05.120]   important that we make sure we're picking one person and
[01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:09.120]   that person is capable of doing the job. You may not agree. But
[01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:12.640]   they need to be competent and capable of doing the job.
[01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:15.920]   Yeah, well, they definitely have to be competent. And this case
[01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:19.440]   was brought by Trump over this specific issue. So I think
[01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:22.800]   that's, if we look at this specific judgment here, that's
[01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:25.680]   what they're going to have to determine in the coming months
[01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:29.520]   or years with this case is was he acting in his duty or was he
[01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:32.240]   not? That's going to be a really interesting case.
[01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:35.200]   Between this ruling and another case called Fisher versus US,
[01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:37.920]   which is the January 6 obstruction case, where the
[01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:42.720]   Supreme Court in a 6-3 majority found that Sarbanes-Oxley was
[01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:47.040]   being misused to create a new crime called obstructing an
[01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:50.080]   official proceeding. When you combine that judgment with this
[01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:53.680]   judgment, I think Jack Smith should just resign. It's pretty
[01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:56.080]   clear that Supreme Court has kicked the legs out from under
[01:17:56.080 --> 01:17:56.800]   his case.
[01:17:56.800 --> 01:18:00.000]   And by the way, Katanji, Katanji Jackson supported that
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:00.320]   decision.
[01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:04.480]   That's right. So again, not a not a hyper ideological, not a
[01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:07.600]   hyper partisan court. They just ruled that Sarbanes-Oxley had
[01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:10.800]   nothing to do with what happened on January 6, and it was being
[01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:13.760]   misused by a creative prosecutor. And I told you,
[01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:16.720]   when these Jack Smith cases first came, I said, it's not the
[01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:19.840]   job of a prosecutor to be creative. Their job is to
[01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:23.040]   narrowly interpret the law and to enforce the law. And you
[01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:25.760]   combine these rulings together, and you can see that Jack Smith
[01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:29.280]   has now an even more uphill battle. It's time for him to
[01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:29.680]   resign.
[01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:34.480]   By the way, that's 200 convictions. It's not just one.
[01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:35.440]   That's right, that's right.
[01:18:35.440 --> 01:18:36.720]   It's 200 of them.
[01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:39.280]   Small percentage of the overall convictions now.
[01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:42.800]   They took hundreds of people who did not engage in any violence
[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:46.160]   on January 6. Many of them just wandered through an open door
[01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:49.680]   in the Capitol, and they were prosecuted to the hilt. They
[01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:52.880]   were sent to jail for that, because this DOJ wanted to send
[01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:56.720]   a statement. They wanted to use them as a political talking
[01:18:56.720 --> 01:19:00.080]   point. And that's a shame. I think hundreds of people were
[01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:05.120]   horribly mistreated by the judicial system as part of a
[01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:06.080]   political prosecution.
[01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:10.000]   Except for the ones who beat police and brought long guns.
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.720]   No problem putting those people in jail. No problem. Anyone who
[01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:16.160]   used violence, go directly to jail, do not pass go. But some
[01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:19.120]   of these people just took a tour through the Capitol.
[01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:22.400]   All those people got suspended sentences and trespassing.
[01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:23.840]   No, some of them went to jail.
[01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:24.560]   The ones who went to jail.
[01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:26.880]   Jacob Chansley spent three years in jail.
[01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:30.000]   Yeah, the ones who went to jail were the ones who beat cops.
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:33.680]   No, not Jacob Chansley. That poor man, just because he wore
[01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:35.840]   the Viking. Remember the guy with the Viking hat?
[01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:40.080]   Oh, yeah. So they also went to jail if you did damage, if you
[01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:41.920]   vandalized. Yeah, that was the other reason people went to
[01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:42.160]   jail.
[01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:44.080]   I saw a video of him getting a guided tour through the
[01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:44.560]   Capitol.
[01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:47.920]   I mean, if you vandalized a Capitol building, I guess you
[01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:48.400]   have to do something.
[01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:49.920]   What did he do? He moved a dais around?
[01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:53.600]   No, I think they like shattered the windows and, you know.
[01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:56.000]   He didn't. I never saw any video of him doing that.
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:56.560]   Anyway.
[01:19:56.560 --> 01:19:59.360]   They picked on him because he was an easy target because he
[01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:03.760]   looked like a weirdo and he had the Viking horns and he has a
[01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:08.560]   history of mental problems. And so they put that man in jail for
[01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:09.360]   years.
[01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:11.680]   Yeah, I'm not concerned about him. I'm concerned about the
[01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:14.000]   ones who brought all the long guns to the hotels around the
[01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.720]   Capitol to have backup firepower.
[01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:19.920]   But, you know, hey, everybody's got a different opinion on this.
[01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:22.240]   We, that wraps up the all-in podcast.
[01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:24.640]   You can have those concerns. I don't think it lets you put
[01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:25.600]   innocent people in jail.
[01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:28.560]   Yeah, I think that you can hold both of those ideas. I don't
[01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:30.800]   think anybody innocent should go to jail and I don't think the
[01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:33.360]   Oath Keeper should have brought guns to the Capitol. Okay.
[01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:35.520]   They didn't. They brought them to Virginia, just to be clear.
[01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:38.560]   Yeah, they brought them to the hotels around them. Huge, large
[01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:38.880]   caches.
[01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:39.280]   In Virginia.
[01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:40.320]   That's correct. Yeah.
[01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:41.200]   In Virginia.
[01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:43.520]   Yeah. They drove to the Capitol on January 6th.
[01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:46.800]   Anyway, I'm not defending them.
[01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:49.040]   No, I'm not defending them. I'm just clarifying that there are
[01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:52.080]   no guns at the Capitol because that's a lie.
[01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:55.360]   But I don't think innocent people who just wandered through
[01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:57.520]   the Capitol should go to jail and that clearly happened.
[01:20:57.520 --> 01:20:59.600]   We agree. They should not go to jail. They should get
[01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:00.800]   trespassing tickets. Okay.
[01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:06.080]   This is episode 186 of the world's number one podcast. Did
[01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:07.840]   Biden resign while we're taping?
[01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:10.560]   Biden just went on a campaign call and he said, "Let me say
[01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:13.680]   this as clearly as I possibly can, as simply and straightforward
[01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:17.200]   as I can. I am running. No one's pushing me out. I'm not
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:19.840]   leaving. I'm in this race to the end and we're going to win."
[01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:21.360]   Whoa.
[01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:23.840]   I think it's more likely than not that they're not going to
[01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:28.720]   replace Biden because the only feasible alternative is Harris
[01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:31.440]   and should be worse. And I think it's more dangerous for the
[01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:34.160]   country, frankly. I'd rather just see Biden finish out his
[01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:38.640]   term than put someone new and inexperienced.
[01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:41.760]   Even if he had to run for office.
[01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:44.400]   It's too bad choices, J-Cal, and I don't agree with Biden's
[01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:46.400]   policies, but there's continuity there.
[01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:49.680]   Okay, for the chairman dictator from the home office in Italy,
[01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:54.720]   Chamath Paihapatia, your sultan of science, and the rain man.
[01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:58.960]   Yeah, definitely, definitely cabinet position. David Sachs,
[01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:02.080]   I am the world's greatest moderator of the number one
[01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:03.600]   podcast in the world. We'll see you next time.
[01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:04.080]   Bye-bye.
[01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:16.000]   Love you, boys. Bye-bye.
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:27.920]   Bye-bye.
[01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:39.840]   Bye-bye.
[01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:45.760]   Thank you, George, because they're all just useless. It's like this like sexual tension that they just need to release somehow.
[01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:47.760]   What about B? What about B?
[01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:49.760]   What about B?
[01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:51.760]   We need to get merch.
[01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:53.760]   Merchies are back.
[01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:55.760]   I'm going all in.
[01:22:55.760 --> 01:23:01.760]   I'm going all in.
