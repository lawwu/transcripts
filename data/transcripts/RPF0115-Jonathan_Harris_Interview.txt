[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.360]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.600]   My name is Joshua Sheets, and I'm your host.
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.920]   Today is Tuesday, December 9, 2014.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.680]   Today, I'm going to share with you an interview with Jonathan Harris,
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.960]   founder of the website 10K2Talent.
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.680]   We're going to talk about how the process of talent discovery and talent development
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.360]   is a fundamental process for launching an independent young adult.
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.600]   ♪
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.640]   I was thrilled when my guest today accepted my invitation,
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.040]   because this is a subject that I think a lot about.
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.240]   And I think this is, for any parent or for any concerned uncle or aunt even,
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.680]   I think this is a subject that has a lot of application.
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.480]   And we're going to get very quickly to the interview here.
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:14.960]   But I want to give you about two minutes of background on this interview
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.200]   and also on this series, of this education series.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.040]   When I set out to essentially cover what in my mind I'm trying to create,
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.480]   which is a comprehensive curriculum of financial planning,
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.200]   I'm trying to make it as comprehensive as possible,
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.080]   there are many subjects and topics and things that I could cover.
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.520]   And in my mind, it's probably infinite,
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.600]   because even if I could get to the end of all of the topics that I'd like to cover,
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.160]   the law would change and I'd have to cover them again.
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.160]   But I decided to pick the one that I think I have the best possibility
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.320]   of actually being able to get to the bottom of.
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.560]   And that's essentially what in financial planning we talk about college.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.040]   I think of it as children and the financial questions and issues
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.000]   surrounding young men and women, children.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.840]   And so essentially what I'm trying to do from my own peace of mind
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.520]   is develop a comprehensive curriculum for you and for me.
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.080]   And there is a bit of self-serving motivation here,
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.320]   is that I'm obviously in a phase of life,
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.480]   I have a one-year-old son, as you've heard me say at least probably 50 times on the show.
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.080]   And so I'm kind of thinking these things through for myself,
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.080]   but I'm also trying to create a bunch of episodes that can stand alone,
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.160]   so I can essentially be done with it.
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.560]   And so in my mind, there are a couple of stages of that.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.400]   There's, I mentioned about early childhood,
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.280]   there's what do we do with education at a younger age,
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.880]   then there's the financial aspect, you know,
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.960]   do we do government education systems,
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.720]   do we do home education systems, what do we do, how do we pay for that?
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.720]   That's why I've done so many shows on education.
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.520]   I'm trying to wrap up college and college funding.
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.040]   That's why I did the show on the Coverdell Educational Savings Accounts.
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.400]   I've got about a dozen more topics that I need to do in-depth like that
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.840]   on qualified tuition programs, student loans, student loans interest,
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:05.120]   student loan details, consolidation, some of those questions I get a lot of times.
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.880]   I need to do some shows on scholarships, fellowships, grants,
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.840]   on opportunity credits, lifetime learning credits.
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.760]   I need to do some shows on educational savings bonds.
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.120]   So there's some specific financial planning topics that I need to talk about.
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:25.440]   But essentially, in my mind, I've got about these 20 to 30 to maybe 40 different shows
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.400]   that are building to create a comprehensive curriculum.
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.000]   Then hopefully, I'm going to be done with talking about
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.800]   kids' education and kids' college and that.
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.360]   And how I'm doing some of these shows is with interview shows like today.
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:48.000]   I'm integrating an interview show like today into that financial technical aspect.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.120]   Because ultimately, when people talk about, "Oh, I want to pay for college,"
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:56.320]   what they often mean is, "I want my child to have a skill and a talent and an ability
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.040]   with which they can earn a living wage in the marketplace."
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.920]   Those two things are not necessarily synonymous.
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.520]   So the technical details of financing college are important,
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:12.800]   but also the question of how do you develop talent, skill, ability, knowledge, and teach that.
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.040]   That's very important.
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:24.240]   So if you feel like there's been a concentration on the show recently on education topics,
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.760]   it's because there has been.
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.880]   And I really want to finish out the education topic.
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:34.560]   And what I'm trying to do is sprinkle in and bring a real variety to the shows each day,
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.000]   have a little bit different, not do four shows in a week on education,
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.040]   but I'm trying to work through with a heavy focus on education.
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:47.760]   Because I think it's one of the few topics that can get through the most quickly as far as the
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.240]   curriculum, the outline that's in my head.
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.280]   When I get to the technical aspects of investment planning,
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:58.720]   that's at least 50 shows right there and probably more.
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.280]   So I hope you're enjoying that.
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.840]   But I hope you're enjoying that.
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.160]   Today, this is not a show about home education.
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.360]   This is a show about talent development.
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:15.520]   And if you have children, I would commend to you that this is ultimately one of the
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:20.800]   major things that you are looking to do with your children is help them discover
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.640]   and develop their talents.
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:28.720]   And I think if we can understand this, we can set them up in so many ways for a lifetime
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:29.600]   of financial success.
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.240]   Because guess what?
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:34.560]   You know those charts, those fancy compound interest charts you read at times that talk
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:40.160]   about how if you start investing at the age of 16 and you quit at 24, you're a multimillionaire
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:40.960]   at the age of 70?
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:41.440]   True.
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:41.920]   They're true.
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.680]   If you do it well, they are true.
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:49.040]   But the key is, do you have any money at 16 to do that with?
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:56.400]   And I think that with the content of today's show, you can help your children have some
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:03.440]   money and a business and an understanding of what their talents are and how to exercise
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.200]   them in the marketplace.
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:05.920]   Here's Jonathan.
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:10.880]   So Jonathan, welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast.
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.160]   I appreciate you being with me today.
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.920]   Thank you, Joshua.
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:14.560]   Thanks for having me.
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:19.440]   I'm very interested in our topic of conversation today.
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.720]   And real quick, I want to have you introduce yourself and share your background.
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:28.480]   But I want to connect our topic of conversation to personal finance, which is what the show
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.120]   is about.
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.520]   We're primarily going to talk today about developing talent in children and different
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:34.960]   ways to do that.
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:39.920]   And sometimes I have feedback sometimes from the audience when I venture into things that
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:43.520]   aren't specifically, how does a Roth IRA work as far as why do I do that?
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:47.840]   Well, the reason I do it is because personal finance and financial planning is far more
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.560]   than any technical detail about money.
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:54.160]   And what I've learned working as a financial planner, that money is only good for one thing.
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.400]   It's to fund the goals that people have of life.
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:00.240]   Well, in a financial planner's office, often children are a big deal.
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.920]   And this usually comes in to how do I pay for my kids' college?
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:07.280]   Sometimes it comes in to how do I pay for my kids' private school?
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.480]   And sometimes it comes in to how do I leave an inheritance for my kids?
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:14.000]   Or how do I make sure I'm not a burden on my kids in their old age?
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.480]   And oftentimes I feel there are entire sections of that conversation that are missing when
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:22.400]   we just focus on those technical aspects of financial planning.
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.440]   And so clearly this is a subject of personal interest to me.
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:29.280]   I have a one-year-old son, but I also want to talk about it from a larger perspective
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:34.800]   because most of us have children, will have children, have had children, know people that
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:43.520]   have children, and are concerned in some regard with our children's future, both our individual
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:45.680]   children and then our children as a society.
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:51.200]   So with that centering of the conversation, Jonathan, I'd love you to share a little
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:56.000]   bit about your background and introduce your website and how did you wind up, what was
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.520]   your personal journey to wind up talking about developing talent in children?
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:09.360]   Yes, well, my personal profile right now is that I do have children at home and I have
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:15.120]   eight children and the oldest is just about to turn 17, so he's 16 right now.
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:20.160]   And I have children all the way down to the ages of three.
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:24.800]   My youngest is a daughter, so I've got six boys and two daughters.
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:34.560]   And what happened was a few years ago, I'm heavily involved, we homeschool, so I am
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:39.520]   personally also heavily involved in the homeschooling decisions and in certain aspects of it.
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:44.560]   My wife shares some of that responsibility with me and I enjoy it.
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:52.080]   And so I started experimenting with some ideas and for making a bigger purpose to our education.
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:56.400]   And in the process of doing that, I was so excited with the results that we were getting
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:01.920]   that I decided I better write this down on a blog somewhere to share because I know that
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:07.760]   two, three years from now, I'd have a hard time remembering the fits and starts when
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:08.560]   you're getting off the ground.
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.640]   I so wanted to share this with other people.
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:13.360]   So that's a big thing.
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:17.280]   Because a lot of times people, you see results and then the typical answer is, "Oh, you
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:21.520]   just must be lucky," which I know burns people with so much work.
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:22.720]   No, I wasn't lucky.
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:25.920]   Yes, I did have a lot of blessings, but you're like, "I had to work this hard."
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:26.320]   Right.
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:30.320]   And so you want to document it along the way so that people can learn from it.
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:31.120]   Right.
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:36.400]   So your children, okay, 17 to 3, and at what age did you start getting interested in this
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:39.680]   topic and what was the catalyst to your interest?
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:48.400]   Well, they probably started getting, by the time my oldest was 12, I think I was already
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:52.240]   seriously modifying things in our schooling environment.
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:58.960]   And the catalyst to it was that I had been laid off from Hewlett Packard.
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:04.480]   So I was in the corporate world, the project manager, and I worked from home, which was
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.640]   a fantastic blessing back then.
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:09.120]   And I could see the layoffs coming.
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:13.600]   Simply, the market had frothed up, way too many people in the market.
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:14.720]   Things were changing.
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:19.600]   This is, Apple was just starting to make its headway through all its tablets and stuff.
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.520]   So the market was changing all across the board.
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:29.760]   And long story short, we started another home business, which is now keeping us afloat and
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:32.320]   paying for the bills and doing a good job at it, my wife and I.
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:39.520]   And I just took over a lot more of the schooling aspect on a day-to-day than I did before.
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:42.720]   So now I really had my hands in the pie and I loved it.
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:49.440]   And I should say, the humorous part is that when we did, in our home business, this is
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:53.600]   really my wife markets to a female market, and I thought, "Hey, I could put my project
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:58.480]   management skills to work and I could communicate directly with all these women, giving them
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:11:59.360]   directions and stuff."
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.360]   It does not translate.
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.480]   My wife says, "You cannot say that."
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:05.440]   And I'm like, "What do you mean?"
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:12.240]   So we decided that we better partition the responsibilities a little more clearly.
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:17.680]   - Did you set up the home-based business to facilitate your being involved with the kids'
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:20.400]   education, or did it just seem to be a happy accident?
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:21.840]   Was it intentional or accidental?
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:33.760]   - Well, the home business was part of an overall desire to start our own business.
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:39.200]   And in that context was to be able to get their kids involved in the business because
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:42.800]   we wanted them to have a much more entrepreneurial spirit.
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:49.840]   But it was accidental in the sense that we didn't know exactly how this was going to
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.440]   work out this way, let's put it that way.
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:56.000]   The timing of the layoffs and so forth, those were all catalysts, but the desires were there.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:05.120]   - Yeah, that's been similar for me, at least, is I've had a desire, and it's one of those
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.240]   generalized desires.
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:10.160]   When I sit down and kind of lay out my vision for my family and my plan, one of the things
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:13.760]   that I've wanted to do is to be very involved in my children's lives.
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:17.840]   And one of the things that discouraged me about the traditional way that financial planning
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:21.360]   was done is that it's a very professional environment.
[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:26.800]   It would probably be hard for me to imagine me bringing my six or seven-year-old daughter
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:29.920]   with me to a confidential meeting with a client.
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:30.480]   Who knows?
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:34.480]   It's just not the kind of environment that that's easily focused on.
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:40.000]   But I didn't want my wife to have to bear all the responsibility of leading the educational
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.720]   charge, so I've been working for years to try to figure out how do I either get my business
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:48.800]   in such a way that it's not going to require me 60 hours a week to do that so I have more
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:53.600]   time away from the office, or what it's looking like now is I'm much more able to pursue a
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:57.440]   business out of the house where I'm more able to integrate my family together.
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:01.600]   And I see, even with my current venture here with this show and then other ideas that I'm
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:08.400]   working on, I see one of the primary benefits of them is to be able to use my business as
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:11.760]   a way to help my children develop skills and talents and abilities.
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:17.040]   And to me, one of the issues that I have with the mainstream approach to education is that
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:20.160]   it seems to me, just from observation, I'm not an expert on this stuff, but it seems
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:25.680]   to me that education all takes place in an artificial environment, in a world where everything
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:31.360]   is essentially constructed in advance and you're just trying to get the right answer.
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:35.520]   I think as an example, I think how many high school chemistry experiments are actually
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:36.160]   experiments?
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:41.120]   Usually, the chemistry teacher is often saying, "The chemistry teacher knows what's going
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:41.520]   to happen.
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:46.880]   It's all set up and we're doing an experiment," so-called, "but it's not an experiment.
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:48.000]   We already know what's going to happen.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.760]   An experiment would be let's start mixing things together and see what happens."
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:56.480]   Well, obviously, you can't do that because it's dangerous, but the point is how do you
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:57.680]   learn except you try things?
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:03.840]   And the biggest problem I have with that, especially for children, is that it causes,
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:14.240]   instead of conditioning for a love and a joy of trying things, some of which seem to work
[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:18.720]   and some of which don't, but that all things are successful because you tried them, it's
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:21.360]   just that sometimes the results weren't results that you wanted.
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:25.120]   It develops this fear of failure and then this fear of failure seems to come back.
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:29.440]   So I look at it and I say, "How can I create real-world scenarios such as, 'Hey, I need
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:33.120]   to redesign my … My one-year-old son is not going to redesign my website, but I see
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:37.840]   no reason why my 11-year-old son can't redesign my website if he's interested.'
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:41.280]   Or if we have other children, I need some photography done.
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:46.480]   Well, why can't my son or daughter use that as an opportunity to practice their skills?"
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:50.400]   And then they're actually learning with me, contributing to the family business, knowing
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:54.320]   that what they do counts instead of being in this artificial environment where it's
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.880]   all fake and it doesn't matter except a bunch of grades.
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:58.000]   >>Rick: Right.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.080]   And you mentioned a little bit earlier the structural environment with the experiments
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:03.840]   and the chemistry.
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:09.920]   And I think that's one of the problems.
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:16.400]   And ironically, I think the problem is simply because our society from a material business,
[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:20.800]   entrepreneurial point of view, has really progressed in general.
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:22.000]   And that's exactly what's happened.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:28.240]   You have this abundance of knowledge, of data out there, of facts, good stuff.
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:30.880]   And it just keeps pouring out and pouring out.
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:38.320]   And you have a structure of education that I think, honestly, is very good at establishing
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:39.320]   the basics.
[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:43.560]   If you want to learn how to read and write, it's been done hundreds and thousands of times.
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:49.280]   And despite all the problems that people have with maybe some slight mental handicaps or
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:53.600]   some techniques, at the end of the road, everybody is pretty much reading and writing.
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:55.680]   And so it's very systematized.
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:59.520]   And then as you go up the grades, you start delving into, like you say, this chemistry.
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:03.160]   The first people who got around, who got to read the books-- in fact, I was reading an
[00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:07.000]   autobiography by someone-- he says, when I was a kid, I got to play around blowing up
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.320]   stuff in the labs.
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:09.680]   Well, that's right.
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:12.160]   And now everything's been systematized in that area.
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:13.160]   And there's no more joy.
[00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:15.640]   That's why you never see anybody write about it.
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:22.440]   And so I think that as part of the issue is that the market, and as much as I criticize
[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:25.920]   the educational system in general, has been very, very effective.
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:33.800]   The problem is that the parents are still locked in to that mode that this formal, one-size-fits-all
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:36.840]   education is going to work for their child.
[00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:44.800]   And so in the beginning-- and that's why I think the differences start-- is in the beginning,
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:50.960]   you have a lot of nurturing with the children, which is absolutely necessary.
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:54.960]   It's the classic gender difference between mom and dad, who mom says, "Don't climb that
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:55.960]   tree.
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.240]   You're going to get hurt and fall out."
[00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:58.720]   And dad says, "Let him climb the tree.
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:00.400]   See how far he can go."
[00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:02.200]   You get that tension.
[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:03.800]   And you know what?
[00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:07.480]   It is true sometimes that little child should not be climbing up that tree, because bad
[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:10.080]   things do happen at that age.
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:11.960]   But at some point, you need to transition over.
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:16.880]   And I think that's where dads have a more instinctive comfort level and know how far
[00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:17.880]   to take it.
[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:20.360]   And that's exactly what happens with education.
[00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:22.320]   You have those phases.
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:29.240]   And if you don't understand that you're phasing into a different area and type of learning
[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:31.820]   for your child, then you can get stuck.
[00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:35.720]   And I think, honestly, it starts way sooner than what people think.
[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:41.360]   And around the age of 12, it's probably hormonal-based and so forth.
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:48.280]   I think that's when things really need to switch from a more nurturing, follow-step-by-step
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:55.120]   to a much more exploratory, a much more adventurous, decisive attack at the learning world.
[00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:59.000]   I'm going to come back to that age of 12, because I've been working hard to develop
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   my vision.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.160]   And I want to come back and hit on that.
[00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:04.440]   But before there, I'd love for you to share a little bit.
[00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:05.440]   So you've got all these kids.
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:09.040]   You've got eight kids on this broad range of time horizon.
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:12.000]   I understand that you desire to be humble.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.920]   It's always tough for a parent to brag on their kids.
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:15.680]   But lay that aside for a moment.
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:19.960]   And what are the types of things that your children at this point are doing that is maybe
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:21.200]   different?
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:22.840]   And what are some examples?
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:25.160]   What's the output of that?
[00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:27.200]   And share with us the real details.
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:31.080]   And feel free to share the struggles, but don't be too humble with it.
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:37.360]   Well, right now, as we're doing this interview, my son is in Sacramento, and that's about
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:42.000]   two and a half, actually three hours drive from where we live in California.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.240]   So we're way up on the north end of California.
[00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:46.320]   And he's down there.
[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:49.800]   He stayed over a couple of nights with some relatives.
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:56.080]   But he has a pain project that he's doing with his drone equipment.
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:59.840]   He has a camera on there where he does aerial photography.
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:02.040]   And he's doing a big construction project.
[00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:06.040]   He has teamed up with an engineering team that he met here, where he did one project
[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:07.040]   for them.
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:12.440]   And they're doing a big project in the downtown area of Sacramento, which is the capital of
[00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:13.440]   California.
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:19.440]   And this is part of his entrepreneurial talent building that we've been working on.
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:20.440]   And so that right now...
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:21.440]   How old is he?
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:22.440]   He's 16.
[00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:23.440]   Okay, wow.
[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:24.440]   Just about 17.
[00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:25.440]   That's great.
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:26.440]   Yeah.
[00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:28.800]   So it's been very exciting for him.
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:36.200]   And in fact, in the beginning, we had him much more involved in, and he still is, in
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:41.560]   the mechanics of our home business.
[00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:45.440]   But I didn't share that too much, because a lot of that stuff is just confidential to
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:47.960]   our own business, and people don't need to know.
[00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:50.000]   And so he was not as much in the limelight.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.960]   But now he's bursting out into the limelight, which we were talking about earlier.
[00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:56.000]   People think, "Oh my goodness, he was born like that."
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.480]   And I'm like, "No, he wasn't."
[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:05.480]   There's a lot of planning in the background from the parent's perspective to be able to
[00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:08.320]   make that happen.
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:12.800]   So he has a business then where he's doing aerial videography using drones, and then
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:13.960]   he's going to take that.
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:15.360]   And will he follow that all the way through?
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:20.200]   Is he having a video editing business where he's producing final video products or just
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:21.280]   raw footage?
[00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:24.480]   What's his business?
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:28.520]   Right now, his business is to be able to...
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:34.200]   The end product is you get two to three minutes of video that people would use for their customers,
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:38.680]   or they would use it to pitch for their next big project.
[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:41.280]   So they would come to a customer and say, "Look at the work we've done."
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:46.000]   And of course, these are projects that have a special advantage if they're seen from the
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   air.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.240]   So if you'll do commercial property, for example, where you can show all the access points,
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:55.800]   you can see where the property is laid out in relationship to the city and so forth.
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:59.480]   So you might do something like a big gas company that has trucks coming and going.
[00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:03.140]   They want to see where the train tracks are and the freeways and so forth.
[00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:08.440]   And so they'll want an aerial view of the property in addition to just the financial
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:09.440]   data.
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:15.760]   And then that will be sent to investors, which are typically in another state, bankers, insurance
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:16.760]   agents.
[00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:22.280]   Everybody who wants a piece of this wants that visual confirmation that the commercial
[00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:24.480]   property is in a viable spot.
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:28.520]   I look at that business idea and I just say, "That is a business idea that there's so much
[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:29.520]   room for."
[00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:35.620]   The interesting thing is that if he has the technical skill to create a quality product,
[00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:40.980]   there's no difference between him at 16 years old being able to do it versus somebody else
[00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:41.980]   at 36 years old.
[00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:42.980]   Absolutely.
[00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:48.580]   And he can earn at 16 years old, assuming he's proficient and good at it, he could earn
[00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:50.540]   an adult's wage doing that.
[00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:57.720]   I had a client here in South Florida who was a photographer, but his only business was
[00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:02.860]   photographing large, fancy houses for upper-end real estate.
[00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:06.200]   So a lot of houses on Palm Beach, a lot of waterfront property, things like that.
[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:08.620]   And they would be staged for sale.
[00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:12.780]   But one of the things that set him apart is he was doing aerial photography.
[00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:14.340]   This was before drones came out.
[00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:18.180]   I don't know if he still does this, but in his day he would use a balloon and he would
[00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:22.540]   float the camera up with kind of like a small weather balloon and he would do this from
[00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:23.540]   the water.
[00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:27.700]   So he would go out in a kayak with the balloon tied to it and he would be able to shoot pictures.
[00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:31.020]   He would take pictures of the house so you get this nice aerial photograph, but you had
[00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:34.860]   no need to rent a helicopter for whatever that cost to get these aerial photographs.
[00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:37.580]   And lots of people, he would sell these to real estate agents.
[00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:42.460]   He would also just go out and take pictures of people's houses and then he would offer
[00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:44.340]   them to people.
[00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:48.220]   He would go out from a public space, take a beautiful picture of somebody's mansion,
[00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:52.580]   and then offer it to them, offer them a print, and many times people would buy it.
[00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:56.820]   And he just created this business, created a marketing with a minimum amount of equipment,
[00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:58.700]   and he was making a very nice income.
[00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:03.380]   Your 16-year-old son, there's no barrier to entry in that market because it's purely based
[00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:06.300]   upon his skill and talent as compared to an adult.
[00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:07.300]   What a cool story.
[00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:08.300]   Yeah, it is.
[00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:18.700]   And to get back, my basic premise is that you can get your children to start developing
[00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:26.140]   some kind of talent that brings value to other people at an early age.
[00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:30.460]   But, and here's the big thing where people get normally tripped up about it, is when
[00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:37.780]   you're talking about developing talent, it's not a static thing that you're developing.
[00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:42.100]   In other words, I didn't wake up my son, "Hey, son, you're 12 years old now.
[00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:43.580]   I know what your talent is.
[00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:45.220]   It's videography with drones."
[00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:52.580]   Well, let me tell you what, when he was 12, drones weren't even out there from a commercial,
[00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:55.180]   accessible point of view like they are right now.
[00:24:55.180 --> 00:25:02.700]   So that's the one thing that really, I try to encourage people, and sometimes I try to
[00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:07.940]   knock some heads together too, it's like, "Look, your child wasn't born genetically
[00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:11.100]   to fly a drone."
[00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:14.100]   And 10 years from now, who knows how that's going to morph.
[00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:19.980]   And so what I tell people to do is you're looking in your environment, look around,
[00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:22.460]   you look for your hidden assets in your family.
[00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:23.460]   There's so much.
[00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:24.980]   You have so many things on hand.
[00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:32.700]   You have so many blessings, some unique quirkiness in your family that defines you.
[00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:34.260]   And instead of seeing it as, "Oh, whatever.
[00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:40.620]   Okay, let me go see if I can go and enroll him in soccer to discover his talent," because
[00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:45.860]   people are still genetically looking for that genetic predisposition to be born for soccer
[00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:52.220]   or some other, it's always some kind of mass group sport, which has its place, but not
[00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:53.340]   in the way most people think.
[00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:58.580]   And so I want people to see that when you're looking at developing talent in someone's
[00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:04.460]   life, you're taking what you have, which is very spiritual too, in a way, because you
[00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:10.940]   look at, in the Bible, one of the famous passages, which is where we get the word "talent" from
[00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:19.300]   in this context, is the parable of the talents, which of course was money and coins.
[00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:24.340]   And it's the parable of the master that leaves and gives everyone various amounts of cash
[00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:27.140]   - talent.
[00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:34.020]   And he goes on this long trip, and of course this whole parable is making a spiritual point,
[00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:38.220]   but I think the principles are just fascinating here, is that when he comes back, he goes
[00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:44.780]   through the line of the servants, the stewards that worked with the money, some multiplied
[00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:50.300]   it a hundred times, some did ten times, various degrees, then he comes down to the last guy,
[00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:53.860]   which is the whole point of this parable, and the guy says, "You know what?
[00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:58.380]   I know you're such a tough guy, I didn't want to mess it up, I didn't want to take what
[00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:02.820]   I have and try to multiply it and take risk."
[00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:06.700]   He's specifically talking about this, "I didn't want to take any risk, I didn't want to multiply
[00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:11.020]   it because I knew you're such a tough guy, you'd probably beat up on me if I failed a
[00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:17.580]   little bit," and of course in the parable, the master just goes off on him and says,
[00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:18.580]   "You know what?
[00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:22.700]   You didn't even try, so since you think I'm such a tough guy, I'm going to give you a
[00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:24.940]   taste of what it's like," and so forth.
[00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:28.220]   And so in that parable, I think we find something really fascinating.
[00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:34.940]   One, there's acknowledgement that people are sometimes blessed in life with various degrees
[00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:41.940]   of advantages, and you can define them in any number of ways, money, you're super smart
[00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:47.020]   when you were born, you've got good looks, whatever it is, you've got friends in high
[00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:53.260]   places, and those are all stuff that you get started off and you didn't particularly earn.
[00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:57.220]   But that's only part of the story, and this is again where most people miss it.
[00:27:57.220 --> 00:28:02.060]   You've got to be working it, so no matter what it is, you're expected to work it.
[00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:08.420]   I think it's a spiritual principle in addition to a material principle.
[00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:15.260]   You have to multiply it and work it, and that really has an impact about it in your educational
[00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:16.780]   life when you apply it to your children.
[00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:20.020]   So you're not looking, you're not walking around and saying, "Hey, where's that treasure
[00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:21.020]   trove?
[00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:24.060]   I'm going to trip over it, here's the gold in the casket from my kid.
[00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:25.940]   Oh, there he is, a drone videographer.
[00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:28.240]   Oh, there he is, a doctor."
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:30.540]   You have certain assets in your environment.
[00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:35.820]   You've got to know what they are, and then you've got to take risks, and you've got to
[00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:38.220]   multiply it.
[00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:44.340]   And that's really a different approach than a scene as you're just filling up your son
[00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:51.060]   or your daughter with a certain amount of knowledge or data, which is kind of how you
[00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:54.380]   approach normally an educational system.
[00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:55.380]   What about your other children?
[00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:59.420]   What are some examples of some of the things that they're doing to develop their talents?
[00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:08.420]   Well, I have a 15-year-old, and he has been working on some bladesmithing projects of
[00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:09.420]   his own.
[00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:10.420]   How cool is that?
[00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:13.860]   Like old-fashioned blacksmithing of making knives by hand?
[00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:14.860]   What do you mean?
[00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:18.620]   Yeah, they call that bladesmithing now to differentiate that from blacksmithing, but
[00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:27.740]   basically you're playing around with the properties of metal in order to give them particular
[00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:32.020]   qualities of flexibility but also great sharpness.
[00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:36.920]   So in the last few years, what's happened is that they've been able to understand how
[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:41.780]   to manipulate metals at the molecular level a lot more.
[00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:45.140]   And you can do it in your home if you know what the techniques are.
[00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:50.580]   And so he's been going on to online forums, closed forums for professional bladesmiths,
[00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:54.540]   and getting ideas from them, practicing in his garage.
[00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:56.140]   We've got a little setup for him.
[00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:57.980]   I've told him how to do that.
[00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:03.300]   And then just recently we came back from a meetup in California for bladesmiths.
[00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:06.180]   I think he was the only teenager there.
[00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:08.900]   And he just loved that.
[00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:12.140]   But that's again an example where when we started off, we live in an area where there's
[00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:20.220]   a lot of leftover folklore and people have a memory of the gold rush here.
[00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:23.500]   Not that they were in it, but their grandparents are, and they know these locations.
[00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:28.700]   And so we have clubs, what we call gem clubs, where there's tons and tons of equipment for
[00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:31.580]   grinding stones and people know where things are.
[00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:32.580]   So we started there.
[00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:35.580]   That's a local asset, a local talent that we had.
[00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:41.820]   And we started going there and things evolved and progressed from there to the point where
[00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:45.100]   we started working more with metals because there was a lot of grinding and understanding
[00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:46.100]   properties.
[00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:53.100]   Then we went to jewelry and then from there we went into more of the metalsmithing and
[00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:55.380]   still making some progress there.
[00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:59.780]   So that was, we took something that we had in our environment, something we had access
[00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:06.060]   to, something we could afford, and then we climbed up the ranks and took advantage of
[00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:08.940]   new opportunities until he is where he is now.
[00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:09.940]   Wow.
[00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:10.940]   How cool is that?
[00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:11.940]   That's awesome.
[00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:12.940]   Yeah, it really is.
[00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:13.940]   It really is nifty.
[00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:14.940]   I have a friend who's into that.
[00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:15.940]   He's doing the same kind of thing.
[00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:20.700]   He built himself a forge and he does it in his garage and took a leaf spring from a car
[00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:26.780]   and banged it into a knife and just totally, he was showing me how he did it and I was
[00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:27.780]   fascinated.
[00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:33.420]   I had no idea that you could change the grain of the metal and change the direction.
[00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:34.420]   What a cool thing.
[00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:39.580]   I'm just curious, and I don't think making money actually should be, I mean for a 15
[00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:43.700]   year old, I don't think making money should be the arbiter of what you do, but I'm curious.
[00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:45.580]   Has he made any money?
[00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:49.100]   Has he done anything associated where there's been any profit with this talent yet?
[00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:50.660]   No, no, not yet.
[00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:56.220]   In fact, that's something I'm working on with him.
[00:31:56.220 --> 00:32:00.940]   I'm not advocating that you should have to make money with your talent right away, though
[00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:03.220]   eventually yes.
[00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:06.820]   I'm putting him onto a lot more business books.
[00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:13.180]   In fact, lately he's about halfway through, I think, what was it, Gerber's book on?
[00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:14.180]   E-Myth.
[00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:15.180]   E-Myth.
[00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:16.180]   He's loving it.
[00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:17.180]   Right.
[00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:21.580]   He's really getting it because he's also in the process of following these forums.
[00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:25.100]   He follows these big guys, which he totally admires.
[00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:28.420]   Every world has their experts and their gurus.
[00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:32.820]   He can tell already, some of them are really, really good technically, but they fail on
[00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:34.300]   the business side.
[00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:40.140]   Another guy may be good technically, maybe not as good, but succeeding with a vengeance.
[00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:42.660]   He's able to provide for his family.
[00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:46.940]   They're doing really well financially, and he can tell the difference.
[00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:53.740]   So he's just so ripe for that information to think about when you're doing your technical
[00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:54.740]   skill like a bladesmith.
[00:32:54.740 --> 00:33:01.780]   A lot of these guys can get so wrapped up in the process itself that they forget that
[00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:07.020]   it's supposed to serve a purpose, basically a purpose for someone else.
[00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:11.020]   You have to find that balance in enjoying the craft, but also remembering you're always
[00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:14.620]   serving the public or serving someone with your craft.
[00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:20.100]   So it's important that it's not just the object you're bringing to them, but it's done on
[00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:25.380]   their time, their schedule, their needs, their aesthetics, whatever other concerns that they
[00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:26.380]   have.
[00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:33.740]   So part of the talent development, like my firstborn, was really understanding that you're
[00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:39.540]   serving people with your skill set, and you develop that early on.
[00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:43.180]   In the process of serving, you're actually modifying your talent, which is an interesting
[00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:47.060]   thing, so it's like a feedback loop that you've got going.
[00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:48.600]   So far you've mentioned two of your boys.
[00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:50.580]   Do they keep blogs on their work?
[00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:53.380]   Do they chronicle their...do they have websites?
[00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:55.380]   Do they chronicle what they're learning?
[00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:56.380]   Yes.
[00:33:56.380 --> 00:34:00.180]   My oldest one, he's one called ReddingDrone.com.
[00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:05.940]   So Redding, R-E-D-D-I-N-G, dot drone dot com.
[00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:13.140]   And Redding is the biggest town or city that we have near us, so he used that for SEO search
[00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:20.980]   engine and he puts his videos that he's done up there as a portfolio for his customers
[00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:22.420]   to check out.
[00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:27.940]   The thing that I see about it, and this is one of my major concerns with how we approach
[00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:36.700]   education and schooling, is I think that what we get paid for is the application of knowledge
[00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:40.180]   and skills to a specific problem that solves a customer's need.
[00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:41.180]   That's how I think about it.
[00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:45.620]   So financial planning, for example, what I get paid for as a financial planner is to
[00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:51.740]   apply knowledge about technical knowledge, about the law, about the tax code, about certain
[00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:53.940]   investment and insurance products.
[00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:58.340]   And then so I get to apply that knowledge, then I apply the skill of understanding what
[00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:03.340]   a client is looking for, what their actual goals are, and then to be able to apply all
[00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:06.900]   of that accumulated knowledge to a specific scenario.
[00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:11.700]   And so what I actually get paid for is not showing up and working and showing up to an
[00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:12.700]   office.
[00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:17.020]   I get paid for applying skill and knowledge to a specific scenario such that it helps
[00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:22.860]   somebody and it helps them more, then they value the help more than it costs them to
[00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:23.860]   have that.
[00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:29.460]   My concern with focusing solely on academic knowledge is that academic knowledge is often
[00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:34.180]   not applied or there's not an easy path where the person can see how to apply it.
[00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:40.060]   But with learning skills and knowledge through a specific interest or talent, I see that
[00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:44.180]   as being able to develop marketing, just a wealth, a broad array of skills.
[00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:50.140]   So if your son has a website, Reading Drone, he has to learn how to make a website, write
[00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:56.060]   copy, take pictures, take video, figure out what's compelling marketing.
[00:35:56.060 --> 00:35:59.380]   He has a real life project to which he can apply all those skills.
[00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:03.180]   And whether he does this for another six months or another six years doesn't matter.
[00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:08.340]   Those skills are many and they're varied and they can be applied to new ventures.
[00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:09.340]   Absolutely.
[00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:15.500]   And in fact, which I forgot to mention here, Caleb was my second one.
[00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:21.500]   So my first one, my first son, carries the same name I do, Jonathan.
[00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:27.900]   And my second one, Caleb, is also writing an e-guide called The Broke Bladesmith.
[00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:37.500]   So he got onto one of the programs that we bought for adults in the marketing world where
[00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:40.780]   they say, "Hey, if you want to break into a field, one good way to do it is write it
[00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:44.140]   from the perspective of a beginner because you're the expert.
[00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:47.820]   There's other people just behind you that need that information."
[00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:48.860]   And it's exactly it.
[00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:50.100]   That's my son got in there.
[00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:54.440]   There's a lot of information for experts, but nothing that was broken down to his level.
[00:36:54.440 --> 00:37:00.220]   So he's in the process, he's about two-thirds of the way done of writing that.
[00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:04.300]   And the inspiration for him to write that in part was because of my third son, who's
[00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:05.420]   13.
[00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:12.300]   And when he was, I think 11, I'm getting confused on the age, but 11 or 12, he wrote two books
[00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:15.580]   on Amazon and has been making cash off of this.
[00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:18.660]   And yes, and so he's my, people can check that out.
[00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:20.060]   He loves getting mail.
[00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:28.300]   He has a website called scarabcoder.com, so scarab, S-C-A-R-A-B-E-R, coder, C-O-D-E-R,
[00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:29.860]   dot com.
[00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:32.780]   And you can check him out there.
[00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:35.260]   And he's connected with people around the world.
[00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:38.680]   In fact, with him, he's really into programming.
[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:40.760]   He loves computer stuff.
[00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:46.600]   And I don't know, when he was 10 or 11, I had this old programming book on my bookshelf
[00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:51.280]   that I had from years ago, and he said, "Why don't you take a look at this?"
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:53.120]   And so he started taking a look at it.
[00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:55.320]   Check on him a couple of days later.
[00:37:55.320 --> 00:38:01.640]   And he says, "Well, you know, so-and-so told me that I should try it this way."
[00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:03.000]   "Who are you talking about?"
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.640]   He had email, which we monitor at that age.
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:09.120]   And I'm like, "Who is that?"
[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:11.840]   He says, "Well, you know, the author of that book."
[00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:14.000]   I'm like, "What, that guy?
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.320]   He's a big guy in the world."
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:16.960]   "Oh yeah, he lives in Sweden now.
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:19.440]   He immigrated from the States to Sweden."
[00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:24.480]   And I'm like, "He wrote to me personally and gave me an updated version of the book."
[00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:30.960]   So he's having this correspondence directly with him, and then there's some other people
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:36.880]   where he was featured in some big conference in the UK on the screen as an example of what
[00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:40.720]   a young person can do with their information.
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:45.000]   Now the interesting thing with all of this is that as much as I love my children, I wouldn't
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:50.520]   -- I don't think that, "Oh my goodness, these kids were born with incredible IQ.
[00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:53.840]   I'm just blown away by their initiative," and so forth.
[00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:56.720]   It's something we actually cultivate in the house.
[00:38:56.720 --> 00:39:00.440]   And that's why I want to give people hope is that this type of greatness that people
[00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:06.120]   think of in terms of talent is actually something you cultivate and you spend a lot of time.
[00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:11.240]   And when it's at a young age, it does not depend so much on the children as it does
[00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:12.680]   on the parents.
[00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:18.880]   And so if there's one thing I could tell parents is that if you wait for your children to discover
[00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:25.560]   that thing that turns them on, like you and I are both turned on by this passion of you
[00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:31.000]   sharing finance with the rest of the world and me for talent, this is late in our life.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:37.840]   What happens if we could have discovered something along those lines when we were 16 or 17?
[00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:39.720]   It just boggles the mind.
[00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:43.920]   But the only way kids can do this is with the help of their parents.
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:48.800]   Not that the parents are doing it for them, but their parents are creating a structure.
[00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:50.680]   You talked about that chemistry issue.
[00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:57.440]   You're creating a structure to be able to explore and go down that road.
[00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:02.720]   And that's a big key component is that parents have a huge impact and they can do it without
[00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:03.720]   spending a lot of money.
[00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:09.360]   One of the things I'm so incredibly grateful for for my parents is that they did that for
[00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:10.360]   me.
[00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:18.520]   They worked hard to expose me to lots of opportunities, to expose me to lots of things.
[00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:24.560]   Everything from on the one end art such as music, piano and singing and instruments.
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:28.800]   They were always willing to go and buy the instrument for their children that expressed
[00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:29.800]   an interest.
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:33.160]   So all of my family had instruments.
[00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:34.920]   When I was a kid I had an opportunity to learn it.
[00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:36.000]   I hated it.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.280]   And so I quit after a while.
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:41.880]   But now I've actually recently decided to start playing the piano again.
[00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:47.160]   But I have a foundation that even though I can't play anymore, it's coming back more
[00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:49.880]   quickly than if I had to start over today.
[00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:53.160]   But all the way to the other extreme of building things.
[00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:55.240]   I did at one time leather work and all these.
[00:40:55.240 --> 00:41:01.080]   And then plus a wide range of diverse jobs which helped to give me a lot of confidence
[00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:04.760]   to where I felt a lot more confident in my own ability and my own knowledge and my ability
[00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:10.440]   to learn new things because I wasn't arriving fresh on the employment scene at the age of
[00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:14.760]   22 years old having just graduated from college ready to learn for the first time.
[00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:20.840]   I had already been through that process a couple of dozen times of starting new things,
[00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:25.040]   learning new skills, being instructed, learning how to be a good student, learning how to
[00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:29.440]   be taught and then learning how to provide value and help an employer be happy.
[00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:35.680]   And it just gave me not a false sense of self-confidence but a legitimate sense of confidence in who
[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:36.680]   I was.
[00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:45.280]   And for a young man, I mean that is an incredibly powerful gift that you can give a young man.
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:46.920]   Absolutely.
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:54.400]   And when I was documenting this, I had already had some thoughts of my own but then I started
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:42:02.280]   actively reading some of the popular books, well-written books on talent development.
[00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:09.320]   You know, what is that elusive something that some people seem to be able to latch on to?
[00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:14.720]   A lot of good information out there from different angles, different perspectives.
[00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:16.360]   A lot of it is not contradictory at all.
[00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:18.160]   I think it's pretty clear.
[00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:24.000]   And obviously one of them that seems so obvious to people but still is misapplied in their
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.280]   own personal lives is that it takes time.
[00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:33.800]   It takes time, lots of time to be able to be as good as you get.
[00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:35.560]   And this includes famous people.
[00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:40.240]   And so it's interesting because this comes up a lot in magazine or popular articles or
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:46.320]   biographies and systematically without fail, every person that can be considered great
[00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:52.160]   in their field really resents it whenever you start off with, "Well, you were probably
[00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:53.960]   born that way."
[00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:56.360]   And they come back with, "You don't understand.
[00:42:56.360 --> 00:43:01.320]   My hands were bleeding every night for four years straight doing this physical activity."
[00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:06.760]   Or, "I read 20,000 books."
[00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:10.000]   And that's what I think most people don't seem to really grasp.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.160]   They think that, "Okay, I'm going to put my kid in front of the piano.
[00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:17.800]   Huh, can they sing on pitch while playing the piano and within five hours?"
[00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:19.760]   And they're like, "Oh, it must not be their talent.
[00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:20.760]   Let's move on to the next.
[00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:22.360]   Oh, let's do some woodworking.
[00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:23.360]   Oh, he cut himself.
[00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:24.480]   It must not be his talent."
[00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:27.640]   Because advanced woodworkers don't cut their fingers.
[00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:31.320]   And there's that merry-go-round that people go through.
[00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:35.160]   I think 80% of the people, parents, are in that category.
[00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:37.440]   They're looking to fall into talent.
[00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:41.640]   You walk around and then worse, worse.
[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:44.280]   My son seems to have a talent playing video games.
[00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:47.360]   So now they're cursed.
[00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:50.480]   Your child is blessed to be born a doctor.
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:54.480]   My son is cursed to be born a video game player.
[00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:56.200]   And you want to like, "You know what?
[00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:59.480]   Maybe it has something to do with more with the parents, how they're managing and structuring
[00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:00.480]   his time."
[00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:01.720]   But that's a delicate subject.
[00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:06.640]   So it goes back again to the parents, to of course the children carry responsibility.
[00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:12.400]   But in the bigger picture, at a young age, it's the structure, the way you approach it,
[00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:17.080]   that can make a huge difference in your child's life.
[00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:21.920]   The 10,000-hour idea, which I assume that's what 10K to Talent is based upon.
[00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:23.200]   Yes, yes, exactly.
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:27.840]   So it's very well popularized after Gladwell wrote his book, this idea that it takes a
[00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:28.840]   certain amount of hours.
[00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:34.280]   I mean, to me, it's such an important concept to grasp.
[00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:40.540]   And it's why the way that we approach a young person's time is such an important issue.
[00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:43.240]   Two things that came to mind out of what you were saying.
[00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:45.400]   One is the idea that it does take time.
[00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:50.400]   I recently finished reading Josh Kaufman's book called The First 20 Hours.
[00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:55.360]   He's the one who wrote the book, Your Personal MBA, and curates the website personalmba.com.
[00:44:55.360 --> 00:45:00.280]   He wrote a book about how the first 20 hours make a huge difference.
[00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:04.080]   And one thing I liked is that there's all this war about, "Well, you can find these
[00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:05.080]   life hacks.
[00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:07.680]   You can find a way to cheat the system."
[00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:12.800]   You can't find a way to cheat true expertise.
[00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:16.460]   Like a true master, there's no way to become a master.
[00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:20.380]   You can start at a different place, and you can have a much more effective way to learn,
[00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:24.000]   which I think is what, when you actually look at the literature, Josh Kaufman is very clear.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.520]   He says, "I can't become an expert," and one of the things he learned to play the ukulele,
[00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:32.960]   "I can't become to be an expert at playing the ukulele in 20 hours, but I can set myself
[00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:38.800]   up in such a way that I approach it in an intelligent way with a clear outcome so that
[00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:44.040]   20 hours in, I can find out, 'Is this something that I want to pursue into the 10,000 hours
[00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:47.480]   to mastery, or is this something that I'm content with?'"
[00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:51.540]   And I think the challenge that parents face today, which is why I feel so strongly about
[00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:57.620]   home education, is that the first 15,000 hours of your child's life is essentially spoken
[00:45:57.620 --> 00:46:01.480]   for with pre-K through 12th grade education.
[00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:06.720]   And if you look at the daily schedule of what that requires, then from, essentially, I'm
[00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:11.520]   going to say 7 a.m., whether school starts, here we have some schools that start at 7.30,
[00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:17.520]   whether it's 7 a.m. to call it conservatively 3 o'clock, every day is already spoken for
[00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:22.960]   for a child's time, plus after-school activities, which for many people, they find a lot of
[00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:26.440]   value in sports and the character development and the skills that come with sports, and
[00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:27.680]   then you have homework.
[00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:34.400]   And so you have all of this time that is devoted to one skill, academic ability, where is there
[00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:37.920]   the time for a child to explore other talents and other opportunities?
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:41.320]   I don't see where it can even happen.
[00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:42.560]   And you're right.
[00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:47.760]   That is typically what does happen, and it's not systematic.
[00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:53.920]   It's not too, because I think some parents, without adopting my method or understanding
[00:46:53.920 --> 00:47:03.040]   it, do have some instinct of that, and they will structure their family life and their
[00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:08.360]   educational life so that there is no such thing as that kind of idea of a runaway education,
[00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:13.200]   where basically you're consuming education for education's sake.
[00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:17.680]   So you're not producing new knowledge, you're just consuming.
[00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:21.160]   So you read two Jane Austen books, well then ten Jane Austen books must be better.
[00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:25.120]   If they had 30 Jane Austen books, it must be even better, rather than you out there
[00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:30.520]   saying, "Maybe I should write something for the world or for my friends that's going to
[00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:32.320]   make an impact on them."
[00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:40.120]   So you've got to change your mindset from just consuming education, kind of like confusing
[00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:42.800]   - if you want to become a great chef, what are you doing?
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:48.400]   You're not porking out on every possible food dish out there, going from restaurant to restaurant
[00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:49.400]   every day, every night.
[00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:52.960]   You think, "Well that's absurd, you're just consuming."
[00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:55.080]   A chef is producing.
[00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:58.960]   You see, that's a huge difference in the - of course you're tasting and you are consuming
[00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:02.240]   at some level, so it's absolutely necessary to consume.
[00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:04.080]   But that's what's happened in the education world.
[00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:07.880]   There's like, there's a thousand different classes in math you can take, a thousand different
[00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:09.280]   classes in accounting.
[00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:13.800]   My goodness, history, politics, I mean your head couldn't explode.
[00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:18.720]   And so, and that's a sense of franticness that parents get, and I get that too sometimes.
[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:21.520]   I have to go back to the drawing board and say, "Okay, halt.
[00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:22.520]   Why are we doing this?
[00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:26.660]   I mean I know this course is fantastic, I know this guy is amazing, but how does this
[00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:30.800]   fit in the bigger picture for my children?"
[00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:35.920]   And so you have to go back and say, "Are we just consuming knowledge for knowledge's sake?
[00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:41.200]   Or are we consuming it with an idea that we want to be able to produce and do something
[00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:42.200]   with this?"
[00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:45.920]   Not everything has an immediate purpose, and I totally understand that there is such a
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:51.920]   thing as you need to learn your alphabet first before you can write a book.
[00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:55.760]   But still, there's a concept, you don't just consume, and that's what people feel.
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:58.240]   They feel so bloated on the education.
[00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:01.000]   Their kids are just slapped from one place to the other.
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:07.320]   So of course, here's the irony, is that then in order to counter that sense of constant
[00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:12.040]   feeling of being on a treadmill, then you throw them into these group activities where
[00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:14.000]   everybody's sort of brain dead to counter.
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   It's the same thing.
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.160]   You're in a dead-end job, you hate it, you come home, what do you do?
[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:21.040]   You don't hit the books a lot of times, you just turn on the boob tube.
[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:23.040]   And you go at it for hours.
[00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:24.040]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:25.040]   And there's a place for some medication.
[00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:26.040]   Sure, absolutely.
[00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:31.200]   But if that defines you, which I feel people, they don't feel like there's no way out, from
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:34.720]   K-12 has been defined for them, or they feel it has.
[00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:37.760]   And by default it will be if you don't take control.
[00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:38.760]   Right, absolutely.
[00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:44.280]   I want to go back to the age, you mentioned the age of 12, and I'm first just going to
[00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:47.000]   ask a question without any preamble, then I'm going to give you my idea, and I'm interested
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:48.880]   in your response as a father.
[00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:55.000]   But how do you approach, with your three-year-old, how do you imagine with your son or daughter
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:02.280]   now that you have a little bit of hindsight, how do you imagine their education and talent
[00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:04.800]   developing in an age-appropriate way?
[00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:08.240]   Is it appropriate for your five-year-old that you're focusing on saying, "You need to start
[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:12.000]   working on this talent," or are you trying to give raw material at that age?
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.400]   What's the age-appropriateness of this?
[00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:24.560]   Well, the reason I, when I talk about, on my website, my selling point to people to
[00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:28.720]   come to my website and learn from me is I'm trying, I had to narrow it down, you know,
[00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:33.880]   talent is such a huge topic, and I'm not there to talk about teenage rebellion or that kind
[00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:38.880]   of stuff, I'm just focused on one topic, how do you get started at the first 100 hours?
[00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:43.960]   And so one of the keys to starting the first 100 hours is the age issue.
[00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:48.520]   A lot of these techniques with talent can start young, they can start later, but I'm
[00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:51.040]   looking at it more from the optimum perspective.
[00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:56.080]   I use the age 12, not because all of a sudden at age 12 something clicks on, but around
[00:50:56.080 --> 00:50:57.760]   that age.
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:01.920]   I think that physically, mentally, emotionally, that's when you see kids starting to chomp
[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:03.360]   at the bit, you know?
[00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:08.000]   They start wanting a little more intellectual reasons, they've got the drive, they'll stay
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:12.120]   up till midnight, you know, they don't need their naps during the day.
[00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:14.640]   It's getting pretty clear cut.
[00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:21.120]   And so at the age of 12 they can start focusing on something, and if they're excited about
[00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:25.600]   it, they will usually carry it through.
[00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:27.000]   You know, you do have some distraction.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:30.920]   When you're younger, it's a lot more about mom and dad hugging you and holding you.
[00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:34.800]   Yes, you can make it through the next page, you can make it through the next exercise.
[00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:41.240]   So their sense of affirmation really comes from that closeness of their parents in order
[00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:44.400]   to be able to keep going forward on something.
[00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:48.320]   Whereas when you get to the age of 12, I think most everybody can remember that, that's when
[00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:52.600]   girls can get a little sassy, guys can get a little dangerous, and I think it's that
[00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:59.440]   natural, good natural instinct to go out there and try something and find a uniqueness for
[00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:01.840]   themselves, but it has to be channeled.
[00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:04.560]   And so I think a talent is a perfect fit.
[00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:08.080]   I have a working theory, and I'm interested in your feedback, and also I want you to share
[00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:14.160]   just what you're doing with your children, but I have a working theory that if we...
[00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:20.920]   So I read some material on basically childhood versus adulthood in historical cultures, and
[00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:24.200]   one of the things I learned when reading, I read some psychological papers and also
[00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:29.500]   just some different books and anecdotes about history.
[00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:35.480]   One of the things I learned is that throughout history, in many if not most civilizations,
[00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:41.280]   if the civilization recognized even childhood, 'cause some civilizations didn't even recognize
[00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:46.680]   the concept of childhood, you're either a baby who required care or you were a person,
[00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:52.280]   and this idea of child versus adult, this artificial distinction didn't really exist.
[00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:56.160]   It doesn't exist in some cultures, but in many cultures, there's a transition, there's
[00:52:56.160 --> 00:53:00.520]   a coming of age, and whether that's in the Jewish culture, we're probably most familiar
[00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:04.480]   with the Bar Mitzvah, the Bat Mitzvah at about 12.
[00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:11.040]   Many cultures have a rite of passage if it's a tribal culture in that early age.
[00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:13.200]   In the Latin culture, it's certain things.
[00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:19.040]   Every culture seems to have this rite of passage, except in our US American culture, and in
[00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:21.520]   the US American context, we don't really have this.
[00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:28.560]   We extend out the age of adulthood to essentially 18, or maybe 21 seems to be our transition
[00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:29.560]   point.
[00:53:29.560 --> 00:53:34.760]   But what I watch, I look and I say, if I think back to myself at 12, I was certainly entering
[00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:39.200]   that phase, we call it adolescence, I was entering that phase of desiring basically
[00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:41.240]   to say that my life matters.
[00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:47.680]   And if I have an outlet for that mattering, a way to productively use that, then I can
[00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:48.680]   be channeled.
[00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:53.880]   If not, then I'll often act out in what society considers to be inappropriate ways, and that's
[00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:56.920]   why we have this fear of adolescence.
[00:53:56.920 --> 00:54:00.440]   My thinking is, if I could integrate this from an educational perspective, I don't know
[00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:06.000]   what your and your wife's philosophy is with regard to how you've approached the academic
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:10.920]   side of schooling, but I've wondered if the basic foundation of academics couldn't be
[00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:13.240]   basically settled by the age of 12.
[00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:17.000]   Historically, we talk about a sixth grade education, eighth grade education, so and
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:24.040]   so famous American forefather only had a sixth grade education, but their sixth grade education
[00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:28.520]   was the equivalent of a college degree in today's world in many instances, not the depth
[00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:31.480]   of subject matter knowledge, but the basics of it.
[00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:39.240]   And I've wondered if age 12 isn't a good place to transition from that intensively guided
[00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:45.760]   academic approach over to a more free thinking, follow your interests type of approach.
[00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:50.920]   My concern, there's a philosophy of unschooling, which is essentially child-led education.
[00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:54.960]   My concern with that is I don't think a child knows what they don't know or what they need
[00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:59.480]   to know at a young age, but that doesn't mean that at 16 necessarily I need to exert the
[00:54:59.480 --> 00:55:04.160]   same kind of control, so I've wondered if 12 couldn't be a good for my family.
[00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:05.160]   We're going to focus on academics.
[00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:09.440]   I'm going to tell you, here's what are the things you need to do until 12, and then after
[00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:15.040]   12 I'm much more of a guide and allowing you to follow your interests, and now I'm going
[00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:19.200]   to be that teacher, that guide who's been a little farther down the road to bring along
[00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:23.120]   the resources and the materials and the tools that are going to help you to really explore
[00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:25.760]   your interests in an appropriate way.
[00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:27.360]   What do you think about my idea?
[00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:28.360]   Absolutely.
[00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:30.280]   I think you're totally right on.
[00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:31.280]   That's exactly it.
[00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:35.040]   And if you listen to most people when they talk about their childhood, when they've got
[00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:38.880]   no agenda to try to explain to you, when they look back on it, I think that's what everybody
[00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:39.880]   wished they had.
[00:55:39.880 --> 00:55:42.120]   I mean, here's the typical thing.
[00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:48.760]   Girls, everybody, there are gender differences, and one of the gender differences typically
[00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:52.120]   with young teenage girls, what is it everybody's afraid of?
[00:55:52.120 --> 00:55:53.560]   It's either two extremes.
[00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:57.800]   Either they're discovering they're beautiful, everybody wants them, and then they're all
[00:55:57.800 --> 00:55:59.960]   over the place, no restraint.
[00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:05.400]   Or they're turned inward, exploring their emotions, almost suicidal.
[00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:09.240]   There's that extreme, those extreme emotions.
[00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:15.000]   But when you look at people that you know in your wide circle of friends and so forth,
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:22.240]   and they have healthy teenage daughters, just to focus on that a bit, and I have a 13-year-old
[00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:30.200]   daughter, and they've got, they usually, the more I think about it, they have some kind
[00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:38.800]   of outlet for all that intense perception, is actually what it is, intense perception,
[00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:40.800]   which is why we love our wives, right?
[00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:45.200]   Well, you know, our wives hopefully by then have gotten more under control.
[00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:50.040]   But they've got this perception, everybody talks about this woman's intuition, and I
[00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:58.400]   think that, as an example, at a young age there is all this intensity, and it can be
[00:56:58.400 --> 00:56:59.400]   channeled.
[00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:02.080]   And if it's not channeled, you can't make it go away.
[00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:06.400]   And I think most people listening to this show will chuckle when I say, "I see a lot
[00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:10.520]   of old grandmas out there dressing their dogs as poodles, and it's usually when they have
[00:57:10.520 --> 00:57:11.600]   no grandchildren around."
[00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:19.120]   I think there are some things in our lives, and for men it's the same thing too, you can't
[00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:21.960]   turn it off, you can only misdirect it.
[00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:26.000]   And I think that's something, you know, deep, and I think most people would agree with that,
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:30.840]   but if you actually really understand that, you need to embrace it, and then actively
[00:57:30.840 --> 00:57:36.440]   find something for your daughter or your son to really focus their energies in something
[00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:37.440]   positive.
[00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:38.440]   And it can't be a fake, by the way.
[00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:43.600]   I hope this is one thing, a hobby is not the same thing as building a talent.
[00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:47.760]   Now there are some resemblances, and they can overlap, but it's not the same thing.
[00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:50.400]   A hobby is for your pure personal consumption.
[00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:55.600]   It's like writing in a diary for yourself, and then when you get older you hope no one
[00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:58.880]   finds it and you burn it.
[00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:03.240]   That's for yourself, it's personal consumption, maybe there's some value at some level to
[00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:09.240]   it, versus writing letters to someone, or even better yet, writing encouraging letters
[00:58:09.240 --> 00:58:13.760]   to someone, or even writing a new story for your friends or a sibling, or writing on a
[00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:17.800]   blog even better about the progress of your talent.
[00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:23.400]   That's producing, that's creative, and in one case you may actually be exacerbating
[00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:28.560]   your senses of, you know, worthlessness or exploring too much of your emotions, you don't
[00:58:28.560 --> 00:58:32.080]   have enough information, whereas in the other one you're focused on other people.
[00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:37.600]   Again, you're back to serving people in a very narrow and specific sense, and usually
[00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:40.320]   people find great personal self-worth in doing that.
[00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:46.000]   I think it's a total good spiritual principle at work in people's lives.
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:49.840]   So if your child has a hobby, don't stay there.
[00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:53.720]   In fact, be very careful, because this hobby can become self-destructive, where they become
[00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:58.640]   so good at something, and then it dawns on them when they're 17 or 18 that no one really
[00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:03.720]   wants to hear them play the ukulele on a professional level, and they go, "Oh my goodness, I should
[00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:10.800]   have insert the blank, focus some of my energies down this path," and they feel betrayed.
[00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:16.740]   So to clarify, my next question was going to be, how do you define talent?
[00:59:16.740 --> 00:59:24.300]   So in your mind, what I hear you saying is that a talent is something that you perhaps
[00:59:24.300 --> 00:59:31.840]   have an interest in, that you perhaps have an ability for, and that it's perceived in
[00:59:31.840 --> 00:59:36.140]   the marketplace as something that is valued in the marketplace.
[00:59:36.140 --> 00:59:39.160]   Is that how you define talent, and how you're making this distinction between a hobby and
[00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:40.160]   a talent?
[00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:41.160]   Right.
[00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:42.160]   Right, that's exactly it.
[00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:45.200]   I mean, you can modify it a little bit.
[00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:48.680]   There are some talents that bring value to other people that maybe don't have a cash
[00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:49.680]   transaction value.
[00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:50.680]   Right.
[00:59:50.680 --> 00:59:55.220]   So I can say like a Mother Teresa example, which is definitely bringing value to people,
[00:59:55.220 --> 00:59:59.440]   and people, you may not want to use the word talent, but it takes a certain skill set in
[00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:03.500]   order to get to that level of service, and that's what I mean by that.
[01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:05.180]   In other words, it's not about yourself.
[01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:08.940]   It's not about, "Can I write 10,000 private diaries on myself?"
[01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:12.220]   It's more about, "Can I produce a book for other people to enjoy?"
[01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:13.780]   That's the dividing line.
[01:00:13.780 --> 01:00:18.340]   Now you've not talked much about natural ability, which is often how we think of talent.
[01:00:18.340 --> 01:00:20.720]   So-and-so, you're so talented.
[01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:24.700]   What role does natural ability play in this?
[01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:29.020]   It plays a much smaller role than people think.
[01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:33.980]   You have to have a certain, and I'm not at all original in this, and I think all the
[01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:40.300]   books on talent that I've read said that natural ability plays a role only in the sense that
[01:00:40.300 --> 01:00:46.620]   if you're going to become a gymnast, you may have some hormonal issues at some point where
[01:00:46.620 --> 01:00:50.780]   your muscles are able to stretch out more, but beyond that, most of those things are
[01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:52.660]   the, you just need the basics.
[01:00:52.660 --> 01:00:57.540]   It turns out that it's much more important to cultivate particular skills to an applied
[01:00:57.540 --> 01:01:00.320]   situation to make an impact.
[01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:02.020]   So they talk a lot about that, and I agree.
[01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:04.220]   I mean, I agree simply because I look around me.
[01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:09.620]   They found that IQ is not a hindrance, but neither is it really a guarantee that you're
[01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:11.020]   going to become great in your field.
[01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:12.700]   You just might have a high IQ.
[01:01:12.700 --> 01:01:18.540]   So you can recite data points or you can do math formulas, but you're not bringing anything
[01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:25.260]   new to the world, and especially for men, to the marketplace.
[01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:28.260]   Yeah, that certainly lines up with my experience.
[01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:30.020]   I really don't.
[01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:33.780]   I'm sure that natural ability does play some role.
[01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:38.860]   It seems hard for me to say that it plays no role, but many of the things that I consider
[01:01:38.860 --> 01:01:44.700]   myself to have an ability in, I can place the time, I mean, even this show, I feel like
[01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:49.580]   I'm in many ways, I'm inept at, still not very good at broadcasting, but I've had many
[01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:57.540]   people compliment me and say that it is natural, and I think to myself, "It's not natural."
[01:01:57.540 --> 01:02:00.100]   I was scared silly to talk to people.
[01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:05.340]   I actually am an introvert, and I can remember the times in my childhood when I decided that
[01:02:05.340 --> 01:02:08.500]   being an introvert and being scared wasn't serving me.
[01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:12.980]   It wasn't helping me, and I forced myself to pretend I was differently until I could
[01:02:12.980 --> 01:02:15.140]   learn how to do something different.
[01:02:15.140 --> 01:02:21.220]   And then even with the ability to think things through and to speak and to articulate, I
[01:02:21.220 --> 01:02:22.220]   had an intention.
[01:02:22.220 --> 01:02:23.220]   I wanted to learn to speak.
[01:02:23.220 --> 01:02:27.020]   I wanted to compose thoughts, and I joined Toastmasters.
[01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:28.460]   I've developed abilities.
[01:02:28.460 --> 01:02:33.660]   So it seems as though, and at this point, I am working hard on saying I need to develop
[01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:39.900]   ability to a much higher level because I feel as though I have a lot to learn, but the natural
[01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:44.180]   ability seems like the least important thing because I could recount, "Here was when I
[01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:45.420]   made this decision.
[01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:48.100]   Here was when I practiced that.
[01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:50.900]   Here were the books that I read on this other subject.
[01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:53.500]   Here were the influences, the people that encouraged me.
[01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:54.500]   Here is who I modeled."
[01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:58.580]   So that seems to line up at least with my experience, however anecdotal.
[01:02:58.580 --> 01:03:03.380]   Yeah, and it should be encouraging to people because you don't have to think, "Oh my
[01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:06.100]   goodness, my child is born to be a concert pianist."
[01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:10.540]   And I'm like, "Okay, that's a death sentence for someone to be born a concert pianist."
[01:03:10.540 --> 01:03:15.500]   I had a friend who told me that one of the worst decisions he ever did was to get a music
[01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:21.020]   degree because everybody told him, "Oh, you look at him."
[01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:26.380]   It was dumb because first of all, he wanted to be able to support a family.
[01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:27.380]   It was more important.
[01:03:27.380 --> 01:03:31.500]   Then he found out that if you really go down that road, most of it involves living in cheap
[01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:33.940]   motels traveling under the tour buses.
[01:03:33.940 --> 01:03:38.940]   You don't get to compose anything of unique for yourself, but not to anyone.
[01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:44.380]   He feels like it was such a big ripoff because had he been, and he partly takes the blame,
[01:03:44.380 --> 01:03:50.380]   had he been more thoughtful about where he was going with this, it could have turned
[01:03:50.380 --> 01:03:51.540]   out differently.
[01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:57.740]   So he was super trained to do something very specialized that had no market value.
[01:03:57.740 --> 01:04:03.580]   Once or last, maybe you do, but very few people will willingly, on their own, go to town,
[01:04:03.580 --> 01:04:05.900]   "Hey, honey, what do you want to do on a Friday night?"
[01:04:05.900 --> 01:04:08.740]   "Oh, yeah, let's go listen to a piano concert in town."
[01:04:08.740 --> 01:04:12.940]   The only time you do is when you have to go see a relative or whatever.
[01:04:12.940 --> 01:04:13.940]   And so why?
[01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:16.700]   Because if you really want to hear it, you just pop in the CD or turn on Pandora.
[01:04:16.700 --> 01:04:17.700]   I just do YouTube.
[01:04:17.700 --> 01:04:18.700]   It's better.
[01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:19.700]   I can see it.
[01:04:19.700 --> 01:04:20.900]   There you go.
[01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:23.860]   But it's not to say that that music is not good.
[01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:25.260]   It's just that it's been done.
[01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:26.260]   The market is fulfilled.
[01:04:26.260 --> 01:04:27.260]   I think that's why we should be rejoiced.
[01:04:27.260 --> 01:04:28.260]   We should be happy.
[01:04:28.260 --> 01:04:31.380]   I mean, you don't want to have to--it's been done.
[01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:32.420]   People aren't demanding more.
[01:04:32.420 --> 01:04:34.300]   It's been done so well.
[01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:39.540]   And if those people from the past came back from the dead, I'm sure they would have packed
[01:04:39.540 --> 01:04:40.540]   concerts.
[01:04:40.540 --> 01:04:41.540]   People would want to listen to them.
[01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:43.980]   It would just be exciting to see them.
[01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:47.740]   But usually people don't want another Beethoven again.
[01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:49.260]   Beethoven's been done.
[01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:51.460]   So it's not that you can't learn and so forth.
[01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:58.740]   It's just that you have to wrap your mind around it that you're not born with a specific
[01:04:58.740 --> 01:04:59.740]   job title.
[01:04:59.740 --> 01:05:00.740]   Maybe that's the best way to say it.
[01:05:00.740 --> 01:05:02.980]   You're not born with a job title.
[01:05:02.980 --> 01:05:06.720]   You're born with certain abilities.
[01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:08.620]   You're born in a particular place and time.
[01:05:08.620 --> 01:05:11.060]   You're born in a particular family.
[01:05:11.060 --> 01:05:13.100]   You're born with certain advantages.
[01:05:13.100 --> 01:05:18.180]   Maybe your dad is wealthy enough that you can have two, three cars, a pickup truck and
[01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:23.220]   a cool-looking car convertible, whereas another person doesn't, but they live in the country.
[01:05:23.220 --> 01:05:29.700]   You have all sorts of advantages and you have to look at it and say, "Okay, what can I combine
[01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:36.620]   together that's going to make it really interesting and get us started today?"
[01:05:36.620 --> 01:05:41.180]   The worst compliment that people think they're making, which to me is the thing I despise
[01:05:41.180 --> 01:05:45.700]   people saying to me, is many people have said, "Joshua, you're a born salesman."
[01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:50.100]   And that one, people are well-intentioned and I understand why they say it.
[01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:52.780]   And so obviously I just say, "Thank you very much," and smile.
[01:05:52.780 --> 01:05:57.980]   But inside I'm saying, "When was the last time you saw a baby pop out and you said,
[01:05:57.980 --> 01:05:59.340]   'Ah, look, here's little Richard.
[01:05:59.340 --> 01:06:01.220]   This little Richard is a born salesman.'"
[01:06:01.220 --> 01:06:06.700]   I think the other thing is that it feels, in a sense, I try very hard, because I've
[01:06:06.700 --> 01:06:12.620]   experienced that myself, I try very hard not to ever compliment people on natural ability,
[01:06:12.620 --> 01:06:14.660]   but to compliment people on hard work.
[01:06:14.660 --> 01:06:20.860]   Because I think if you only knew, if you only knew how hard it is for me to, when I was
[01:06:20.860 --> 01:06:25.980]   in Outbound Sales, if you knew how hard it was to pick up the phone and face the fear
[01:06:25.980 --> 01:06:30.560]   of rejection, if you knew how hard it was to sit in the car outside of a prospective
[01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:34.660]   client's office and screw up your courage and say, "I'm going to go in there and I'm
[01:06:34.660 --> 01:06:35.660]   going to do it."
[01:06:35.660 --> 01:06:37.420]   Now with time it gets easier.
[01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:42.460]   What happens is if there's this idea that somehow you're a born salesperson, then the
[01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:46.380]   new person getting in who's sitting there staring at their phone, and I remember the
[01:06:46.380 --> 01:06:50.180]   first time when I got into the insurance business, I remember the first time I had to make an
[01:06:50.180 --> 01:06:54.500]   outbound call to a friend of mine to say, "Hey, I'm in the insurance and investment
[01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:55.500]   business.
[01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:56.500]   I'd like to talk to you."
[01:06:56.500 --> 01:06:58.940]   I stared at the phone for 20 minutes.
[01:06:58.940 --> 01:07:00.660]   I just scared to pick it up.
[01:07:00.660 --> 01:07:01.980]   And finally I said, "That's it.
[01:07:01.980 --> 01:07:02.980]   I'm going to do it."
[01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:04.300]   And I did it.
[01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:10.140]   And we diminish, I feel like we diminish people's hard work if we focus on natural ability and
[01:07:10.140 --> 01:07:18.260]   not on their personal self-development achievements, which is probably what they are more than
[01:07:18.260 --> 01:07:19.260]   anything else.
[01:07:19.260 --> 01:07:20.260]   Absolutely.
[01:07:20.260 --> 01:07:27.180]   You say that, and every person that is great in a field, even the sales, I've listened
[01:07:27.180 --> 01:07:29.300]   to some of those guys.
[01:07:29.300 --> 01:07:34.860]   Every single one of them, I cannot think of one exception, has said they have worked their
[01:07:34.860 --> 01:07:38.220]   little behinds off getting to where they are.
[01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:42.260]   Now it does not mean, for example, if somebody had truly a speech impediment, a physical
[01:07:42.260 --> 01:07:45.920]   speech impediment, it might have been difficult for them to reach that.
[01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:49.540]   Maybe it would have been offensive enough to people, difficult enough for people to
[01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:52.740]   ... No matter how to understand.
[01:07:52.740 --> 01:07:54.820]   So yeah, okay, there are some physical things.
[01:07:54.820 --> 01:07:58.520]   You may not be ... If you're born with a limp in your foot, you probably won't become an
[01:07:58.520 --> 01:08:00.300]   ultra marathon runner.
[01:08:00.300 --> 01:08:02.580]   Though sometimes that's amazing too.
[01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:05.060]   Sometimes with technology you can overcome that.
[01:08:05.060 --> 01:08:08.740]   So there are some obviously common sense stuff, but most of it's not true.
[01:08:08.740 --> 01:08:11.260]   I think people kind of know that.
[01:08:11.260 --> 01:08:12.260]   They kind of know that.
[01:08:12.260 --> 01:08:18.060]   It's just that when you get down and you look at your own children, you do.
[01:08:18.060 --> 01:08:23.140]   I think this is overall a sense of maybe despair is too strong of a word, of resignation.
[01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:24.140]   That's the right word.
[01:08:24.140 --> 01:08:27.020]   Resignation that has already been laid out for their kids.
[01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:32.740]   So really what they're doing is your children are fighting the same as thousands of other
[01:08:32.740 --> 01:08:37.420]   children on exactly the same data points of knowledge.
[01:08:37.420 --> 01:08:38.420]   There's no other room.
[01:08:38.420 --> 01:08:41.380]   So if you're really going to climb up, you're fighting against thousands of other students
[01:08:41.380 --> 01:08:44.820]   to become the best calculus students so you can get into the colleges, get in, and so
[01:08:44.820 --> 01:08:46.380]   forth and so on.
[01:08:46.380 --> 01:08:52.900]   Not to say that there's not a need for society for certain very well, well-defined skill
[01:08:52.900 --> 01:08:56.340]   sets, but there is a huge world of opportunity.
[01:08:56.340 --> 01:08:58.820]   In fact, that's where always the excitement comes in.
[01:08:58.820 --> 01:09:01.660]   People don't make movies about well-defined skill sets.
[01:09:01.660 --> 01:09:09.180]   They make movies, exaggerated or not, about people combining new skill sets in unusual
[01:09:09.180 --> 01:09:10.780]   ways and breaking ground.
[01:09:10.780 --> 01:09:17.180]   In fact, that's the other little secret is that the 10,000-hour principle is the basic
[01:09:17.180 --> 01:09:20.940]   idea that if you do this for 10 years, day in and day out, and you focus at it, and you're
[01:09:20.940 --> 01:09:25.780]   not just lollygagging, but you're thinking about it, breaking down what you're doing,
[01:09:25.780 --> 01:09:29.140]   and wrapping your mind around it, you'll become the top in your field in that area.
[01:09:29.140 --> 01:09:34.180]   Well, the other little secret is that that's only, I think, if you compete in exactly the
[01:09:34.180 --> 01:09:37.220]   same space that thousands of other people are doing it.
[01:09:37.220 --> 01:09:42.340]   If you decide, "Hey, I'm going to become like a Dilbert cartoon guy where I have a little
[01:09:42.340 --> 01:09:47.060]   bit of modeling skills, and I've read business books, and I've worked somewhat in the corporate
[01:09:47.060 --> 01:09:51.220]   environment, I'm going to make some witty comments about corporate life and philosophy
[01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:53.460]   and put it out there in a cartoon format."
[01:09:53.460 --> 01:09:57.300]   In fact, that's one of the examples that I give, and people laugh about it.
[01:09:57.300 --> 01:10:02.620]   Now, that combination of skills is unique, and to become that good where you find that
[01:10:02.620 --> 01:10:08.260]   balance of rhetoric and cartooning and so forth becomes unique.
[01:10:08.260 --> 01:10:13.180]   You don't need to compete against Van Gogh or all these other famous painters or graphic
[01:10:13.180 --> 01:10:14.180]   designers.
[01:10:14.180 --> 01:10:17.380]   You just have to find a unique combination of skills.
[01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:22.260]   We live in an age where, oh my goodness, I think this is the best age for this, and maybe
[01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:24.620]   a century to come we'll even be better.
[01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:30.940]   There's so much stuff out there, and you just combine it in a unique way, and wow, that
[01:10:30.940 --> 01:10:33.260]   can be so exciting for kids and for parents.
[01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:38.020]   It really is an exciting time, and go where the competition is less.
[01:10:38.020 --> 01:10:42.060]   It makes me just think of how I have a personal pet peeve, and this is my issue.
[01:10:42.060 --> 01:10:48.980]   I have a personal hatred of GPA calculations, test-taking, and things like SATs and ACTs,
[01:10:48.980 --> 01:10:52.180]   standardized methods of measurement.
[01:10:52.180 --> 01:10:55.860]   It makes me think of an anecdote when you talk about developing a unique skill.
[01:10:55.860 --> 01:11:00.500]   I remember, and the source of this was I listened to, it's available on YouTube.
[01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:04.460]   There's a YouTube video called The Ultimate History Lesson, and it's an interview with
[01:11:04.460 --> 01:11:09.740]   a man named John Taylor Gatto, who's one of my favorite authors on the subject of education.
[01:11:09.740 --> 01:11:12.900]   Somewhere in the middle of the interview, it's about a four to five hour interview,
[01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:14.500]   and it's available free on YouTube.
[01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:17.820]   Somewhere in the middle of that interview, he's talking about some experiences that he
[01:11:17.820 --> 01:11:18.820]   had.
[01:11:18.820 --> 01:11:23.740]   He was a teacher in New York City, and he was interviewing college admissions counselors
[01:11:23.740 --> 01:11:25.060]   to the big schools.
[01:11:25.060 --> 01:11:27.580]   I think it was one of the Ivy Leagues, either Harvard or Yale.
[01:11:27.580 --> 01:11:30.700]   He's talking with them and asking, "What do you really care about?"
[01:11:30.700 --> 01:11:31.700]   He was talking with them.
[01:11:31.700 --> 01:11:36.660]   What came out of the discussion was that the Harvard or Yale admissions officer, they really
[01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:39.100]   didn't care about standardized testing.
[01:11:39.100 --> 01:11:44.180]   They didn't really care about GPA very much because they had many, many, many thousands
[01:11:44.180 --> 01:11:50.340]   of people with absolutely the top ranked scores applying, and they couldn't accept all of
[01:11:50.340 --> 01:11:52.860]   them, so they had to come up with different criteria.
[01:11:52.860 --> 01:11:57.060]   He probed, Gatto did, he probed and he said, "What is it that really stands out to you?"
[01:11:57.060 --> 01:12:03.860]   He says, "We like to find people who have basically set off on dangerous, individualized
[01:12:03.860 --> 01:12:05.220]   sports activities."
[01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:07.780]   Things like sailing, offshore sailing.
[01:12:07.780 --> 01:12:12.900]   They gave an example that stuck with me of this young man who they had just accepted,
[01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:16.940]   and he didn't have very good test scores, but he had invented a sport.
[01:12:16.940 --> 01:12:23.500]   He had invented the sport of off-road, seatless, unicycle riding.
[01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:31.120]   He had built this whole entire way to track his performance and build all these rules
[01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:35.860]   for himself of off-road, seatless, unicycle riding.
[01:12:35.860 --> 01:12:36.860]   Here he was.
[01:12:36.860 --> 01:12:39.580]   It was such a rare, abnormal thing.
[01:12:39.580 --> 01:12:45.140]   He invented the sport, but that got him admission to the prestigious Ivy League University where
[01:12:45.140 --> 01:12:51.860]   there are dozens of excellent academic, high school, all-American football players who
[01:12:51.860 --> 01:12:56.500]   were probably denied access where he was able to get in simply because he was unique and
[01:12:56.500 --> 01:12:57.500]   different.
[01:12:57.500 --> 01:13:02.220]   The basic rule of sailing 101 applies in every single aspect.
[01:13:02.220 --> 01:13:04.740]   What is your unique selling proposition?
[01:13:04.740 --> 01:13:09.380]   It matters whether you're selling video services to a construction company or whether
[01:13:09.380 --> 01:13:13.420]   you're selling yourself to a college entrance exam or whether you're selling yourself on
[01:13:13.420 --> 01:13:14.980]   a podcast or whatever it is.
[01:13:14.980 --> 01:13:17.380]   What is your unique selling proposition?
[01:13:17.380 --> 01:13:18.980]   Nobody ever taught me that in high school and college.
[01:13:18.980 --> 01:13:19.980]   Not once.
[01:13:19.980 --> 01:13:21.980]   I had to learn that myself.
[01:13:21.980 --> 01:13:26.300]   Well, that's because that's not their structure, their business.
[01:13:26.300 --> 01:13:30.860]   They're not even set up structurally to do it that way.
[01:13:30.860 --> 01:13:36.020]   In some ways, you're asking the public school classroom to do more than it's possible
[01:13:36.020 --> 01:13:37.940]   of delivering.
[01:13:37.940 --> 01:13:39.900]   You have to take charge as a parent.
[01:13:39.900 --> 01:13:43.860]   You can use that environment, even the public school classroom.
[01:13:43.860 --> 01:13:47.660]   That's one thing that people can honestly take a look at.
[01:13:47.660 --> 01:13:52.660]   If you're in a situation where you feel like you don't have that much control over the
[01:13:52.660 --> 01:13:57.300]   educational course that your child is taking for all sorts of reasons, then you can actually
[01:13:57.300 --> 01:14:01.140]   – and by the way, this is an open call to your listeners.
[01:14:01.140 --> 01:14:06.460]   If they've done something like this, I would love to hear from them – where you can negotiate
[01:14:06.460 --> 01:14:07.900]   probably with your teachers.
[01:14:07.900 --> 01:14:13.060]   This takes effort on the side of the parents to say, "Hey, I heard that you're working
[01:14:13.060 --> 01:14:18.580]   through the history of the Renaissance in history class.
[01:14:18.580 --> 01:14:25.340]   Instead of my child doing XYZ book report, would you mind if they did – my child has
[01:14:25.340 --> 01:14:26.980]   a talent in music, a core talent.
[01:14:26.980 --> 01:14:28.740]   She's really into this.
[01:14:28.740 --> 01:14:32.980]   Would you mind that instead of using that particular book, they chose this other book
[01:14:32.980 --> 01:14:40.020]   about that time period, but talking about the music development and the basic songs
[01:14:40.020 --> 01:14:42.100]   and lyrics that are used during that time period?"
[01:14:42.100 --> 01:14:43.940]   She could write her book report on that.
[01:14:43.940 --> 01:14:49.820]   That would be a simple example of how you could insert yourself as a parent.
[01:14:49.820 --> 01:14:51.140]   Clear the way.
[01:14:51.140 --> 01:14:54.060]   Clear the way for your child because your child won't be able to have that negotiation
[01:14:54.060 --> 01:14:56.700]   capability with the teachers.
[01:14:56.700 --> 01:14:58.100]   The teacher might say, "Sure.
[01:14:58.100 --> 01:15:00.260]   If you're behind it, I'm okay with this.
[01:15:00.260 --> 01:15:03.340]   I just don't want to take the responsibility to have to negotiate with 30 kids, everyone
[01:15:03.340 --> 01:15:06.700]   clamoring for something."
[01:15:06.700 --> 01:15:15.260]   Every history class, you could hijack and use it so that your musically inclined child
[01:15:15.260 --> 01:15:18.940]   is developing historical perspective on music.
[01:15:18.940 --> 01:15:22.300]   You do this all across the academic subjects.
[01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:27.180]   Thousands of hours later, I guarantee you, your child is going to be phenomenal.
[01:15:27.180 --> 01:15:30.860]   It's not just going to understand the mechanics of playing music, they're going to understand
[01:15:30.860 --> 01:15:37.900]   all the stuff that goes behind the scenes in being able to compose music, why it's
[01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:40.140]   used, where it's used, and so forth.
[01:15:40.140 --> 01:15:45.780]   You can still hijack your child's standard curriculum and make it serve your purposes.
[01:15:45.780 --> 01:15:50.740]   It would take a little more work if you don't have direct control over it, but I do believe
[01:15:50.740 --> 01:15:51.740]   it can be done.
[01:15:51.740 --> 01:15:55.220]   By the way, I would love to hear from your listeners if they've done something like
[01:15:55.220 --> 01:16:00.340]   that where they have a technique for systematically negotiating with their teachers so they get
[01:16:00.340 --> 01:16:06.060]   their child to focus more on what they're trying to develop long term.
[01:16:06.060 --> 01:16:07.060]   Right, absolutely.
[01:16:07.060 --> 01:16:10.460]   I have a weakness that I often go to the extreme of, "Pull the kids out!"
[01:16:10.460 --> 01:16:15.940]   I do believe that, but the reality is that many parents aren't in that situation.
[01:16:15.940 --> 01:16:21.100]   Every study I've ever seen that has connected improvements in a child's academic ability
[01:16:21.100 --> 01:16:26.340]   and preparation for life, the only thing that's statistically verifiable is the parental involvement,
[01:16:26.340 --> 01:16:29.620]   and the parental involvement makes all the difference.
[01:16:29.620 --> 01:16:33.160]   What it makes me think of, just one anecdote for you of how I think you could apply things
[01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:38.220]   like history in an interesting way, I've never found a teacher who, when I've shown an interest
[01:16:38.220 --> 01:16:42.340]   in their subject, that hasn't bent over backward to help me.
[01:16:42.340 --> 01:16:47.580]   I feel like most teachers, many teachers, exist in a world where they're dying for a
[01:16:47.580 --> 01:16:50.740]   student to show a little bit of interest.
[01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:55.140]   When their student shows some interest, they will do, I've never met a teacher that wouldn't,
[01:16:55.140 --> 01:16:59.060]   the makeup of a teacher is one who lays down their life for their students.
[01:16:59.060 --> 01:17:05.020]   There are exceptions, of course, but the majority of teachers I know are the most giving, kind-hearted
[01:17:05.020 --> 01:17:07.300]   people who lay down their lives for their students.
[01:17:07.300 --> 01:17:11.420]   The student or the parent, a little bit of extra effort can make a huge difference.
[01:17:11.420 --> 01:17:14.900]   My favorite history project I ever did was, I always liked guns when I was a kid.
[01:17:14.900 --> 01:17:18.420]   I thought it was fun, so I traced the history of the firearm.
[01:17:18.420 --> 01:17:21.540]   I made this video for a seventh grade history class.
[01:17:21.540 --> 01:17:29.020]   In that video, I had video of me shooting every gun from a Revolutionary War musket,
[01:17:29.020 --> 01:17:30.020]   a Minuteman rifle.
[01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:35.020]   I had a buddy of mine who was a gun collector, and he brought his whole collection from muskets
[01:17:35.020 --> 01:17:40.500]   all the way through, we went through World War I, World War II, we shot all the way up
[01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:42.700]   through modern day AR-15 and AK-47s.
[01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:47.620]   We couldn't get our hands on an automatic one, but I shot a semi-automatic AR-15.
[01:17:47.620 --> 01:17:50.300]   You want to talk about feeling like a top dog.
[01:17:50.300 --> 01:17:54.180]   It wouldn't fly, I don't think, in 2014, but when you're a seventh grader and your history
[01:17:54.180 --> 01:18:01.140]   project has a video of you shooting an AK-47, an AR-15, how cool is that as far as history
[01:18:01.140 --> 01:18:04.260]   that I know and that I remember?
[01:18:04.260 --> 01:18:08.600]   Application to a specific interest with extra effort from a teacher and parent and a friend
[01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:12.100]   of mine who was really gracious toward me.
[01:18:12.100 --> 01:18:18.060]   I'd like to close with two subjects, and you actually just hit on one of the final three
[01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:22.580]   questions I was going to ask, which are basically ideas for parents in different contexts.
[01:18:22.580 --> 01:18:24.140]   Home education is one thing.
[01:18:24.140 --> 01:18:26.980]   If you're in government schooling, that's another thing.
[01:18:26.980 --> 01:18:33.380]   What do you do if a child simply doesn't seem to be exhibiting any motivation?
[01:18:33.380 --> 01:18:36.260]   Because I think that's something that many people struggle with and say, "This kid is
[01:18:36.260 --> 01:18:37.580]   totally unmotivated."
[01:18:37.580 --> 01:18:39.780]   What do you do with the topic of motivation?
[01:18:39.780 --> 01:18:42.980]   >> Yeah, actually, that's interesting.
[01:18:42.980 --> 01:18:48.380]   My observation is that you tend to have two extremes.
[01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:53.300]   It's that either you have children who are very motivated in the sense that they take
[01:18:53.300 --> 01:18:56.820]   on every project they can find.
[01:18:56.820 --> 01:19:01.700]   That is quite common, where they're just hyper-involved.
[01:19:01.700 --> 01:19:07.740]   And then you have the other extreme where kids seem to be almost listless with no energy,
[01:19:07.740 --> 01:19:13.220]   no motivation, and so forth.
[01:19:13.220 --> 01:19:15.800]   The root cause is pretty much the same.
[01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:25.580]   In the one case, the over-involvement is simply because they don't have a focus.
[01:19:25.580 --> 01:19:30.380]   Typically, that can often be because the parents are wealthy enough or they have enough emotional
[01:19:30.380 --> 01:19:34.940]   time to spare where they can drive them around to all these activities, do all these events,
[01:19:34.940 --> 01:19:35.940]   and so forth.
[01:19:35.940 --> 01:19:40.020]   So you're kind of on a high all the time.
[01:19:40.020 --> 01:19:42.100]   The other one is the same thing.
[01:19:42.100 --> 01:19:48.260]   They have a lack of focus also, but in that case, they're usually completely left to themselves
[01:19:48.260 --> 01:19:49.260]   as a general rule.
[01:19:49.260 --> 01:19:50.260]   And I mean by left to themselves.
[01:19:50.260 --> 01:19:51.580]   I don't mean that they're latchkey kids.
[01:19:51.580 --> 01:19:57.180]   I'm just saying that you tend to think of your child as he does.
[01:19:57.180 --> 01:19:59.020]   School is something that's not part of your world.
[01:19:59.020 --> 01:20:00.340]   It's something they do over there.
[01:20:00.340 --> 01:20:04.040]   All you're doing is making sure you're sitting down and are you doing your exercises.
[01:20:04.040 --> 01:20:06.760]   It's about the level of involvement that people have.
[01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:11.900]   And that's, I think, a tendency of you're going to find that where people are going
[01:20:11.900 --> 01:20:12.900]   to become listless.
[01:20:12.900 --> 01:20:16.180]   I hope I'm saying that word correctly.
[01:20:16.180 --> 01:20:18.440]   But with no motivation.
[01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:20.880]   So it depends on the age.
[01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:26.240]   If they're 12 versus 16, I think you have something else on your hands.
[01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:30.240]   If it's 12, it's going to be very easy to turn it around, honestly.
[01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:31.240]   100% guarantee.
[01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:38.280]   If they're 16 or 17, it is going to be more difficult if this has been going on for years
[01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:41.380]   because they are transitioning to adult life.
[01:20:41.380 --> 01:20:46.580]   And the boost you're going to need to give them, the guidance that you're going to need
[01:20:46.580 --> 01:20:50.600]   to give them, is going to have to be a lot stronger, a lot bigger, bolder than when they
[01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:52.720]   are younger.
[01:20:52.720 --> 01:20:57.560]   It is true that when you're younger, a hug from mom and dad is probably going to do it.
[01:20:57.560 --> 01:21:00.920]   Or an ice cream cone is going to help you push through that difficult part.
[01:21:00.920 --> 01:21:03.680]   When you're 16 or 17, that's not going to cut it.
[01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:10.040]   You're going to need a bigger reason for everything or a bigger motivation in order to break through.
[01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:14.900]   So what I would recommend is that you sit down and you don't look at the personal interest
[01:21:14.900 --> 01:21:15.900]   only.
[01:21:15.900 --> 01:21:17.800]   And in fact, a non-motivated child, that's the problem.
[01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:20.980]   He doesn't have a real personal interest going on.
[01:21:20.980 --> 01:21:23.280]   So that's only one aspect you want to look at.
[01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:24.560]   You want to look at three other things.
[01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:27.720]   You want to look at your family goals or your family identity.
[01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:31.200]   So what makes you strong as a family.
[01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:33.760]   And you want to look at your environmental advantages.
[01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:38.720]   And by that I mean you want to look at all the people, the network of friends, the environment
[01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:43.320]   that you live in if you're in a city versus living on a ranch versus living near the beach
[01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:45.000]   or on the mountain.
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:49.960]   You want to look at all of that and count your assets.
[01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:56.200]   And you want to also look at your academic passions, your academic goals that you want
[01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:57.200]   for your child.
[01:21:57.200 --> 01:22:02.560]   And you're going to combine them together so that you're going to come up with a focus,
[01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:03.560]   an action focus.
[01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:06.200]   In other words, you're going to do something.
[01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:10.040]   You're going to do something where you're going to combine your personal interest, a
[01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:15.640]   family goal, and something in your environment where you can draw on and your academic intellectual
[01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:21.540]   side to it and combine it in one directed action.
[01:22:21.540 --> 01:22:24.480]   So that when you're going to go out there and act on it, you're going to have success
[01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:25.920]   almost right away.
[01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:29.440]   And that's exactly what people need when they're that unmotivated.
[01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:32.560]   If you listen to them, they say, "I'm not good at anything."
[01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:34.720]   That's what they'll say when they're not.
[01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:37.040]   Usually if they're unmotivated, they're also broody.
[01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:38.040]   They feel useless.
[01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:40.000]   They feel stupid.
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:43.120]   They're not good at anything that anybody cares about.
[01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:44.520]   And that is correct.
[01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:45.520]   That is correct.
[01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:49.200]   They have actually philosophically perceived their problem, that what they are doing does
[01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:51.360]   not matter.
[01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:54.680]   And by telling them, "Do more of what does not matter," is not going to solve their
[01:22:54.680 --> 01:22:56.640]   problem.
[01:22:56.640 --> 01:22:58.120]   So that's what I'm saying.
[01:22:58.120 --> 01:23:02.800]   You need to find that focus where you're combining all of your advantages.
[01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:09.240]   And this is where the family has a huge advantage over waiting to leave after high school to
[01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:12.560]   find it, because you can find your way after high school.
[01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:14.080]   But it is so much more difficult.
[01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:15.080]   It is.
[01:23:15.080 --> 01:23:16.080]   Absolutely.
[01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:17.080]   It is so much more difficult.
[01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:25.800]   If your family's identity is behind you, you're going to explode with motivation.
[01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:28.040]   Explode with motivation.
[01:23:28.040 --> 01:23:34.940]   And families really need to look inward and say, "What is it that makes us who we are?"
[01:23:34.940 --> 01:23:39.680]   And let's use that strength to help our child go forward.
[01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:44.760]   That's a whole topic in itself, because it's not about replicating your family into your
[01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:45.760]   child's life.
[01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:54.720]   It's about using your energy and your strength so that your child can act inside that environment
[01:23:54.720 --> 01:23:56.280]   and start making progress.
[01:23:56.280 --> 01:23:57.280]   Absolutely.
[01:23:57.280 --> 01:24:01.640]   Yeah, because at 16, you're already getting blocked, by the way.
[01:24:01.640 --> 01:24:06.360]   You're already being ... you're moving out of the cute phase.
[01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:09.600]   And now mothers are worried about their daughters.
[01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:14.040]   You're 16 or 17, but you still have room to sleep on someone's couch if you had to in
[01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:16.920]   order to spend the weekend learning something.
[01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:19.280]   But the older you get, that window is closing.
[01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:27.160]   And society rightly gives you an opportunity to go out on the edge, but that window closes.
[01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:28.160]   Right.
[01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:29.160]   Yep.
[01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:30.160]   It does.
[01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:34.120]   And so you need to grab that and run with it.
[01:24:34.120 --> 01:24:37.680]   And that's where the family really comes into play.
[01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:44.120]   Your authority to clear the way for you to negotiate on your behalf is tremendous.
[01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:48.160]   And that's the biggest influence, just the permission to follow something.
[01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:49.160]   Absolutely.
[01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:54.560]   You know, for me, if my mom or my dad were opposed to something, or if my mom or my dad
[01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:59.280]   gave me permission to explore something, in many ways, that's all I needed.
[01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:02.960]   And I could have gone ahead because of that confidence that we have in our parents.
[01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:08.160]   I could go against any societal norm because of that confidence that I have in my parents
[01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:11.160]   and in their direction in my life.
[01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:16.720]   But down the road, once you're an adult, you have to, in many ways, your parents' approval
[01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:20.480]   or disapproval becomes much less important.
[01:25:20.480 --> 01:25:28.640]   And now you have to deal with your going against societal norms on your own, in your own strength.
[01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:30.960]   And you usually don't have the reserves to do that.
[01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:31.960]   Right.
[01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:34.320]   And so, in fact, that's what came out in the talent literature.
[01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:40.960]   They said the one common thread is that no one ever achieved that level of greatness
[01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:42.680]   without investing that level of time.
[01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:44.240]   And so that came up.
[01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:47.680]   So why is it that so many talented people start when they're young?
[01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:51.280]   And they are all unanimously in agreement, and this is from different perspectives, that
[01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:53.560]   it had nothing to do with age, per se.
[01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:56.600]   It had simply to do with the fact that when you're that young, the parents are usually
[01:25:56.600 --> 01:25:59.960]   clearing the way for that level of commitment.
[01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:03.440]   And they said that usually when somebody finally wakes up and says, "Hey, I can do something
[01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:08.560]   great with my life and focus," they're 18, 19, 21, but they might be trying to juggle.
[01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:10.240]   People are not giving you breaks anymore.
[01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:13.400]   You have to put food on the table, and you don't have time to experiment.
[01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:17.560]   You say, "I've got to pay for the gas in my car, or am I going to go buy a drone and break
[01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:18.560]   it?"
[01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:19.560]   You don't have time anymore.
[01:26:19.560 --> 01:26:22.980]   You can do it, but it can become very extreme.
[01:26:22.980 --> 01:26:25.940]   And that's another side we don't have to talk about.
[01:26:25.940 --> 01:26:29.880]   But people can achieve greatness in their talent, but also destroy their families at
[01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:30.880]   the same time.
[01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:35.240]   That's another dark side of it, which does not have to exist.
[01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:41.400]   And again, it goes back to, basically, frankly, it's the parents behind it in most cases.
[01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:47.280]   Or in other extreme cases, the parents were taken out of the picture through tragedy or
[01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:52.960]   abandonment, and they were adopted by a mentor that just poured themselves into them.
[01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:56.960]   So there's pretty much no exception that they can think of, where these people have not
[01:26:56.960 --> 01:27:03.120]   invested tons of time, and most of the time, it's simply, the young age is simply because
[01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:04.500]   time is on their side.
[01:27:04.500 --> 01:27:08.000]   And they said most of these things can still be achieved, and they are, in adulthood and
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:09.720]   later on, it's just much more difficult.
[01:27:09.720 --> 01:27:10.720]   Right.
[01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:11.720]   It is.
[01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:16.400]   So you just don't get that's why there's so many young people when they say, "When I was
[01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:21.040]   seven," and then they start, "I was at," you know, the Tiger Woods is a typical example.
[01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:22.920]   The Bill Gates is another one.
[01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:27.720]   You know, when you read the story of Bill Gates, I read the summary, but I didn't read
[01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:28.720]   the alibi.
[01:27:28.720 --> 01:27:32.640]   Basically, you have someone who's playing hooking in school, who is theoretically in
[01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:35.000]   class, but really he was in the lab.
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:41.160]   And the other big one is that he and Steve Ballmer, whoever his partner was, would sneak
[01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:42.160]   in.
[01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:45.840]   They found out that the university lab not far from their home was basically unattended,
[01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:48.200]   what, from three to six in the morning.
[01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:54.240]   So they would sneak in there and play on one of the very few computers that were available.
[01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:57.280]   I guess they had multitasking or multithreading at that time.
[01:27:57.280 --> 01:27:58.520]   And they said, "There's no secret.
[01:27:58.520 --> 01:28:00.720]   These guys spent tens of thousands of hours."
[01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:02.840]   And then an opportunity came up at a nearby plant.
[01:28:02.840 --> 01:28:04.400]   They said, "Does anyone know how to program in this?"
[01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:07.680]   And the lab teacher said, "Yeah, I know a young so-and-so."
[01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:09.780]   So there's more to it than just that.
[01:28:09.780 --> 01:28:14.000]   But the point is, their parents were benignly looking the other way.
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:15.000]   Right.
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:16.000]   Right.
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:20.080]   And I think Outliers makes a big deal about it, that people owe a lot to other people
[01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:24.280]   in the sense that had the parents not looked the other way conveniently, had the lab person
[01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:28.680]   not looked the other way, obviously they could have, but they saw that, "Hey, this person's
[01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:30.640]   taken off with it.
[01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:32.720]   Let's let him go with it."
[01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:41.480]   And you see this repeated over and over where people have invested themselves into a child.
[01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:43.760]   And it doesn't mean that they are teaching the skills directly.
[01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:49.800]   Rather, they are creating the structure where they can blow up the lab if they have to and
[01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:50.800]   no one gets hurt.
[01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:59.000]   One of the most valuable things we can do, I think, is protect people's safety but give
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:00.960]   people room to explore.
[01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:01.960]   How valuable.
[01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:05.520]   I was going to make a comment.
[01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:06.880]   I'm actually going to ask a question.
[01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:13.600]   Do you have any idea how much you've spent on helping your kids with some of these talent
[01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:15.360]   development, I guess would be the term?
[01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:18.200]   I mean, financially, you mean?
[01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:19.200]   Yeah.
[01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:20.200]   Actually, money.
[01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:21.200]   Do you have any idea?
[01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:23.200]   Very, very, very little.
[01:29:23.200 --> 01:29:27.160]   Even all the drone equipment that my son does, he bought with his own money that he earned
[01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:29.960]   by working in our business.
[01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:37.520]   And that's actually an important part, is that I might subsidize or I might buy a couple
[01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:42.960]   to get him started, but I actually do want them to have a taste of what it feels like
[01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:48.320]   to take care of whatever tools or equipment that you're needing.
[01:29:48.320 --> 01:29:55.320]   For example, just recently, Nicholas, a 13-year-old, he likes to run his own Minecraft hosting
[01:29:55.320 --> 01:29:59.800]   site with all the administrative stuff that goes on it, but he has to pay for it out of
[01:29:59.800 --> 01:30:00.800]   his own cash.
[01:30:00.800 --> 01:30:02.160]   I could easily pay for it.
[01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:03.320]   It's no big deal.
[01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:07.080]   But I want him to feel, "Hey, you're giving up your soda and your drinks," or whatever
[01:30:07.080 --> 01:30:11.640]   it is that you would normally do with that, in order to run your site.
[01:30:11.640 --> 01:30:16.160]   I do this on a small level, and the higher up they go, the more they are invested in
[01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:19.240]   buying their tools.
[01:30:19.240 --> 01:30:25.960]   They are very aware of the cost trade-off.
[01:30:25.960 --> 01:30:29.680]   Most of my investment has been a time investment.
[01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:34.240]   When they are younger, I've had to drive them and sometimes sit in the back with my computer
[01:30:34.240 --> 01:30:39.440]   because the adults simply wouldn't tolerate having a child there with dangerous equipment.
[01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:40.440]   They don't want to be responsible.
[01:30:40.440 --> 01:30:41.960]   I understand that.
[01:30:41.960 --> 01:30:48.960]   But it is a burden on me, so I will come with my work and catch up with my laptop while
[01:30:48.960 --> 01:30:52.560]   he's in the other room with dangerous bandsaws and whatever it is.
[01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:56.480]   So it's mainly a time investment more than anything else, because I use that principle.
[01:30:56.480 --> 01:30:57.880]   I'm using my environment.
[01:30:57.880 --> 01:31:03.560]   I don't think, "Hey, my son is going to become a deep-sea diver, but we live five hours away
[01:31:03.560 --> 01:31:04.560]   from the ocean."
[01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:07.920]   Well, okay, I could force it, which means either my family would never see me on the
[01:31:07.920 --> 01:31:13.360]   weekend while he and I are developing that skill, or it would bankrupt me because I don't
[01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:16.560]   have the financial resources to pay for someone else to take him.
[01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:20.720]   So I work within my environment and I go with it.
[01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:26.800]   Now, as they get older, they make more money, and so they can go places and do more things
[01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:30.520]   on their own, which is a natural progression.
[01:31:30.520 --> 01:31:34.080]   That's part of the talent development, is understanding it's not just the actual core
[01:31:34.080 --> 01:31:38.800]   skill that people see in the outward part, it's all the stuff behind the scenes that
[01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:40.480]   needs to get done.
[01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:44.160]   So with my son, we didn't talk about that, but a lot of it had to do with learning how
[01:31:44.160 --> 01:31:46.240]   to pitch to grown-up people.
[01:31:46.240 --> 01:31:47.680]   So my son actually enjoys that.
[01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:52.720]   He actually likes going to complete strangers, like at a real estate presentation, and show
[01:31:52.720 --> 01:31:54.320]   how it works and tell them what he can do.
[01:31:54.320 --> 01:31:56.800]   He got those tips from other people.
[01:31:56.800 --> 01:32:04.520]   So a lot of the skills are working in the background to make the visible one happen.
[01:32:04.520 --> 01:32:05.960]   You sparked another idea.
[01:32:05.960 --> 01:32:11.520]   Have you done anything in addition to working with your children to run their businesses,
[01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:16.080]   have you done anything specific with teaching them personal finance that you think has been
[01:32:16.080 --> 01:32:17.080]   helpful?
[01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:21.480]   I know your oldest is still only 17, but have you employed any tactics or strategies that
[01:32:21.480 --> 01:32:23.480]   you think have...
[01:32:23.480 --> 01:32:28.280]   We are big podcast junkies in our household.
[01:32:28.280 --> 01:32:33.120]   My wife is probably the biggest consumer of it because as part of our business, there's
[01:32:33.120 --> 01:32:37.080]   a lot of manual work that needs to get done.
[01:32:37.080 --> 01:32:46.120]   And so we have lots of MP3 players, iPods, iPhones, and we listen to financial podcasts.
[01:32:46.120 --> 01:32:48.120]   My oldest likes to listen to some of those too.
[01:32:48.120 --> 01:32:51.920]   So we'll get some of it that way, but most of it happens as conversations around the
[01:32:51.920 --> 01:32:52.920]   table.
[01:32:52.920 --> 01:32:56.920]   And they'll be like, "Why are we so busy?"
[01:32:56.920 --> 01:33:00.680]   And we'll do special treats like we'll have some food brought in or something because
[01:33:00.680 --> 01:33:02.360]   we've got a sales campaign going on.
[01:33:02.360 --> 01:33:04.600]   We've got to work around the clock pretty much.
[01:33:04.600 --> 01:33:07.760]   And so we'll talk about that to say, "When does the campaign end?"
[01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:11.280]   And the younger ones will say, "Why can't we just give it to them?"
[01:33:11.280 --> 01:33:15.240]   We'll say, "Well, we could, but then you'd only want to give it to people who might be
[01:33:15.240 --> 01:33:16.240]   qualified."
[01:33:16.240 --> 01:33:21.040]   So we have these ongoing business discussions as a part of our life and we encourage it.
[01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:24.760]   And the older they get, the more we let them in on the actual finances of what's going
[01:33:24.760 --> 01:33:26.000]   on.
[01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:27.640]   When they're younger, they don't need to know everything.
[01:33:27.640 --> 01:33:32.320]   But as they get older, our oldest is very well aware of the money flowing in and out
[01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:39.280]   of our business, which is what we personally allow him to see because we can have those
[01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:40.280]   conversations.
[01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:41.880]   So a lot of that stuff we learn, my wife and I.
[01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:47.280]   In fact, we're going through the whole issue of whether or not to incorporate him.
[01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:49.240]   And so we're having this discussion, the pros and cons.
[01:33:49.240 --> 01:33:52.840]   I go and see some financial consultants and they give me their advice.
[01:33:52.840 --> 01:33:56.920]   Another one gives me a different opinion and we'll talk it over with him and I'll ask
[01:33:56.920 --> 01:33:58.400]   him, "Can you afford it?"
[01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:03.040]   And then we have this session, but I also want to make sure that no one's going to
[01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:07.560]   come back and sue me if you accidentally crash your drone into a portion and now I've got
[01:34:07.560 --> 01:34:08.600]   to pay for the paint job.
[01:34:08.600 --> 01:34:09.680]   So we have these discussions.
[01:34:09.680 --> 01:34:14.480]   So he's learning in a very conversational way.
[01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:15.480]   Right.
[01:34:15.480 --> 01:34:22.320]   Prior to the other question was simply one of the things that I was, why I asked about
[01:34:22.320 --> 01:34:27.680]   how much you've invested is I look at investing in kids and having done a good bit of formal
[01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:31.600]   financial planning, I oftentimes am working with a client and they're working on their
[01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:35.940]   estate plan and I'm looking at them and they're saying, "Joshua, how do I transfer along
[01:34:35.940 --> 01:34:39.160]   this million dollars that I want to leave behind to my kids?"
[01:34:39.160 --> 01:34:41.800]   Or we're working on, again, college is a common thing.
[01:34:41.800 --> 01:34:47.360]   And I've often looked at that and I've thought to myself, "A million dollars is nice, but
[01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:53.440]   if you've done a good job," and what I mean by good job is if your child is financially
[01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:59.400]   effective, by the time the parent dies at, what, 18 years old and the child is 50, is
[01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:04.120]   an extra million dollars going to make that big of a difference in the 50-year-old's life?
[01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:07.320]   Sometimes it is, especially if you haven't done a good job and your child is financially
[01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:08.320]   irresponsible.
[01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:09.320]   Right.
[01:35:09.320 --> 01:35:12.560]   And I think for people who's financially irresponsible, they probably pretty much have things set.
[01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:13.560]   They're not going to change.
[01:35:13.560 --> 01:35:17.400]   The average 50-year-old, at least that I've worked with, that's all of a sudden inherited
[01:35:17.400 --> 01:35:21.200]   a half a million bucks from their parents, they don't really change anything.
[01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:24.840]   I mean, maybe they buy a fancy red car because they know it would have made their parents
[01:35:24.840 --> 01:35:26.400]   happy to buy a fancy red car.
[01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:30.640]   But inheriting a half a million or a million bucks doesn't really make any difference to
[01:35:30.640 --> 01:35:31.920]   their life.
[01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:35.680]   And I think, did you invest in your child when they were young?
[01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:41.440]   And so, as some people's virtual financial advisor, I guess, here on the show, I hereby
[01:35:41.440 --> 01:35:47.680]   give you permission to not worry so much about the financial estate that you leave behind
[01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:51.040]   at your death and to invest in your children when they're young.
[01:35:51.040 --> 01:35:55.120]   And if that investment means switching from a job where you're working out of the house
[01:35:55.120 --> 01:35:58.840]   to where you're working in the house, so you can take your computer with you to the local
[01:35:58.840 --> 01:36:04.440]   maker's shop to help where your child needs to spend time, they're building a wooden knife
[01:36:04.440 --> 01:36:09.520]   handle, or whether it means taking a year off and not saving for retirement so that
[01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:14.600]   you can expose your children to traveling to 15 countries all around the world in 15
[01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:19.800]   months, or whatever the cost is, if it's the cost of time for one parent to stay home so
[01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:25.240]   that you can educate your kids at home, so instead of spending eight hours a day in a
[01:36:25.240 --> 01:36:29.880]   formal thing, you can spend four hours a day taking care of academic stuff and six hours
[01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:32.680]   a day of working on talent development.
[01:36:32.680 --> 01:36:37.760]   I hereby give you permission to spend the money now while your kids are young, because
[01:36:37.760 --> 01:36:42.840]   that's going to make a much bigger difference to where your 50-year-old child is, rather
[01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:46.600]   than them inheriting a million bucks because you worked in slaves so that you could save
[01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:48.960]   the million dollars in your 401(k).
[01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:54.920]   Money is only good to buy the thing, money is utterly pointless except for the things
[01:36:54.920 --> 01:36:56.480]   that it can buy.
[01:36:56.480 --> 01:37:01.680]   And when your child is young, you have a small window of time over that, I don't know, 12
[01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:07.240]   to 20 years, I guess, you have a small window of time to make a dramatic difference in where
[01:37:07.240 --> 01:37:09.440]   they wind up long-term.
[01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:14.600]   Spend the money there, and chances are you won't need to leave the million dollars behind
[01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:17.760]   at the end, and if you do, it's not going to wreck their life.
[01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:23.280]   So I give you permission to put that very high on your financial plan of spending the
[01:37:23.280 --> 01:37:27.260]   money now while it actually does some good, and then while you're alive and you can enjoy
[01:37:27.260 --> 01:37:32.400]   watching it do the good instead of wondering if it did any good after you were dead and
[01:37:32.400 --> 01:37:34.560]   gone.
[01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:37.720]   So that would be my encouragement.
[01:37:37.720 --> 01:37:38.800]   Any last words that you have?
[01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:43.000]   Tell us about your website, 10k2talent, and then you have a book, the book is for sale
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:44.800]   there, right?
[01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:47.820]   So tell us about that and who it would be a good fit for and who it wouldn't be a good
[01:37:47.820 --> 01:37:48.820]   fit for.
[01:37:48.820 --> 01:37:58.440]   Yeah, my website is 10k2talent, so one zero K like kilo, that's short for 10,000, so it's
[01:37:58.440 --> 01:38:06.600]   10K and then 2TALENT, T-A-L-E-N-T dot com, go there, and I have lots of blog posts, tips
[01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:10.040]   on how to get started, and I actually explain the basic principle out there.
[01:38:10.040 --> 01:38:15.240]   I also have the e-guide that I sell, I have a coaching course that can help parents go
[01:38:15.240 --> 01:38:16.760]   through that.
[01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:21.960]   I have another course that teaches people how to use a blog to showcase their child's
[01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:25.760]   talent, like a living portfolio that you build over time.
[01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:30.560]   And actually if your listeners are interested, for the next 30 days, if they just want to
[01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:32.400]   email me, I'll send them the free guide.
[01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:34.160]   I'd be glad to do that.
[01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:48.640]   They email me at talentcoach@10k2talent.com and just tell me, you heard me on Joshua's
[01:38:48.640 --> 01:38:54.600]   interview, and I'll send you the guide, it's a PDF guide, and you can work through it.
[01:38:54.600 --> 01:38:59.080]   It's basically a worksheet that you can go through and it's easy to understand.
[01:38:59.080 --> 01:39:03.600]   Emotionally it might be challenging as you work through it, especially when you look
[01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:06.400]   through your family goals, but it's very easy to do.
[01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:09.800]   I think if people come away with just one idea from it, it'll be worth reading.
[01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:10.800]   That's great.
[01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:12.280]   Man, I appreciate you doing that.
[01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:15.640]   That'll be an awesome resource for people.
[01:39:15.640 --> 01:39:20.440]   So you can email Jonathan at talentcoach@10k2talent.com and then also I'll put links to your site
[01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:22.440]   and then to your son's site, it's actually in the show notes.
[01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:26.480]   I did want to correct, because I think you misspelled it earlier, it's scarabcoder.com.
[01:39:26.480 --> 01:39:27.480]   Oh, thank you.
[01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:28.480]   You said scarabcoder.com.
[01:39:28.480 --> 01:39:29.480]   Thank you.
[01:39:29.480 --> 01:39:30.480]   It's scarabcoder.com.
[01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:31.480]   Thank you.
[01:39:31.480 --> 01:39:35.920]   So that's for your younger son.
[01:39:35.920 --> 01:39:37.320]   So what an awesome resource.
[01:39:37.320 --> 01:39:41.320]   So if you want this in the 30 days, you'll see the date, whatever the date is that this
[01:39:41.320 --> 01:39:44.360]   goes live, 30 days out from that, there'll be an option.
[01:39:44.360 --> 01:39:45.960]   If not, just go by the site.
[01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:50.440]   If you're listening to this after 30 days, just go by 10k2talent and you can buy the
[01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:51.440]   guide if you're interested.
[01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:55.000]   I've got a copy of it here and it looks like a really cool resource.
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:56.680]   Not quite there with my one-year-old son.
[01:39:56.680 --> 01:40:01.960]   He's not quite working on his bladesmithing skills yet, but I'll give him two years.
[01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:05.320]   Yeah, don't give him a blade yet.
[01:40:05.320 --> 01:40:07.760]   Jonathan, thanks so much for taking the time to come on the show.
[01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:09.080]   I really, really appreciate it.
[01:40:09.080 --> 01:40:10.080]   This has been great.
[01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:11.080]   Thank you.
[01:40:11.080 --> 01:40:12.080]   I enjoyed this.
[01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:15.080]   Isn't that awesome?
[01:40:15.080 --> 01:40:19.560]   Do you have some ideas of some things that you can do with your children, even in your
[01:40:19.560 --> 01:40:20.560]   own life?
[01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:22.480]   I think about this for myself.
[01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:25.640]   What are the talents that I can identify and develop?
[01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:28.960]   I hope you really enjoyed that and I hope you learned a lot.
[01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:35.920]   Make sure to take Jonathan up on his generous offer to take a look at his course.
[01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:37.840]   I've taken a look at it myself.
[01:40:37.840 --> 01:40:43.600]   My child is a little bit young at this point, but it's in my resource file for organizing
[01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:45.000]   my thinking.
[01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:46.320]   I found it to be really useful.
[01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:51.360]   I know Jonathan is semi-obsessed with the topic of learning and developing and improving
[01:40:51.360 --> 01:40:52.360]   it.
[01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:57.080]   He's a talent coach at 10k2talent.com.
[01:40:57.080 --> 01:41:03.600]   Mention that you heard it on Joshua's show on Radical Personal Finance and he will hook
[01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:06.680]   you up with a copy of that course.
[01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:07.680]   That's it for today's show.
[01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:10.840]   If you enjoyed today's show, make sure to subscribe.

[01:41:50.160 --> 01:41:55.400]   I'm getting ready to launch a members only podcast that's going to have some of the
[01:41:55.400 --> 01:41:56.560]   back story on the show.
[01:41:56.560 --> 01:42:00.040]   I'm going to share with you a lot of what I'm learning as I create the show and many
[01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:03.040]   of you would like to do something similar to what I'm doing and I haven't been able
[01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:06.920]   to find the kind of resource that I would like to find so I'm going to create it.
[01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:07.920]   Check that out.
[01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:11.600]   Thank you to those of you who are leaving reviews on iTunes or Stitcher.
[01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:14.920]   I've got the last one here in the iTunes reviews, the most recent that I haven't read
[01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:16.120]   on the show.
[01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:22.000]   So today's review comes from Dee and Dee says, "Practical road to financial freedom.
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:26.760]   Joshua's passionate and excellent in-depth discussion, fascinating and inspiring interviews.
[01:42:26.760 --> 01:42:31.440]   I consider myself fairly well versed in financial topics and I am still learning something daily
[01:42:31.440 --> 01:42:33.240]   from Joshua's podcast."
[01:42:33.240 --> 01:42:34.240]   Thank you, Dee.
[01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:35.240]   I appreciate it.
[01:42:35.240 --> 01:42:36.240]   That's the last review on iTunes.
[01:42:36.240 --> 01:42:38.380]   I'm going to switch to Stitcher reviews now.
[01:42:38.380 --> 01:42:40.640]   If you wouldn't mind, if you haven't done it already, I'd be thrilled if you would
[01:42:40.640 --> 01:42:43.500]   leave a review for the show on iTunes or on Stitcher.
[01:42:43.500 --> 01:42:46.800]   That would help a ton and make sure to subscribe on either of those devices.
[01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:50.400]   I'm working right now on a new app for the show so on any device it will work and you'll
[01:42:50.400 --> 01:42:54.320]   be able to have direct access to the show with the new app once I get it launched.
[01:42:54.320 --> 01:42:55.320]   Thanks so much for listening.
[01:42:55.320 --> 01:42:56.320]   Be back with you tomorrow.
[01:42:56.320 --> 01:42:56.320]   [Music]
[01:42:56.320 --> 01:43:06.320]   [Music]
[01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:29.320]   [Music]
[01:43:29.320 --> 01:43:31.680]   Thank you for listening to today's show.
[01:43:31.680 --> 01:43:39.680]   This show is intended to provide entertainment, education, and financial enlightenment.
[01:43:39.680 --> 01:43:45.980]   Your situation is unique and I cannot deliver any actionable advice without knowing anything
[01:43:45.980 --> 01:43:47.700]   about you.
[01:43:47.700 --> 01:43:55.040]   This show is not, and is not intended to be any form of financial advice.
[01:43:55.040 --> 01:44:03.440]   Please, develop a team of professional advisors who you find to be caring, competent, and
[01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:09.480]   trustworthy and consult them because they are the ones who can understand your specific
[01:44:09.480 --> 01:44:16.280]   needs, your specific goals, and provide specific answers to your questions.
[01:44:16.280 --> 01:44:19.160]   Hold them accountable for your results.
[01:44:19.160 --> 01:44:24.160]   I've done my absolute best to be clear and accurate in today's show, but I'm one person
[01:44:24.160 --> 01:44:25.720]   and I make mistakes.
[01:44:25.720 --> 01:44:30.320]   If you spot a mistake in something I've said, please come by the show page and comment so
[01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:32.680]   we can all learn together.
[01:44:32.680 --> 01:44:35.320]   Until tomorrow, thanks for being here.
[01:44:35.320 --> 01:44:39.560]   The holidays start here at Ralph's with a variety of options to celebrate traditions
[01:44:39.560 --> 01:44:40.800]   old and new.

[01:44:51.720 --> 01:44:52.720]   your traditions.
