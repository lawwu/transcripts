[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.420]   Maybe some AI systems end up voting, or maybe we decide they shouldn't and they don't.
[00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.580]   And either way, you have this kind of world where there's a bunch of different beings
[00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.740]   that all have rights and interests that matter, and they vote on how to set up the world so
[00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.920]   that we can all hopefully thrive and have a good time.
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.840]   We have less and less material scarcity, so fewer and fewer trade-offs need to be made.
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:17.840]   That would be great.
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.120]   Does anything strike you as unimaginable about that?
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.760]   Yeah, the fact that you can have beings that can be copied at will, but also there's some
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.180]   method of voting that...
[00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.260]   Yeah, that's a problem that would have to be solved.
[00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.480]   We have a lot of, today we have a lot of attention paid to how voting system works, who gets
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.580]   to vote, and how we avoid things being unfair.
[00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.760]   And yeah, it's definitely true that if we decided there was some kind of digital entity
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.420]   that it should have the right to vote, and that digital entity was able to copy itself,
[00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.920]   you could get some havoc right there.
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.320]   You'd want to come up with some system that maybe restricts how many copies you can make
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.320]   of yourself.
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.160]   These are problems that I'm hoping can be handled in a way that, while not perfect,
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.200]   could be non-catastrophic by a society that hasn't been derailed by some huge concentration
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.920]   of power or misaligned AI systems.
