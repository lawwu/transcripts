[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.960]   I should like to call your attention this morning to the words which are to be found
[00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:15.920]   in Paul's epistle to the Ephesians in the second chapter verses 20, 21 and 22.
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:23.320]   And built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:31.700]   chief cornerstone, in whom all the building, fitly framed together, groweth unto one holy
[00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:40.420]   temple in the Lord, in whom ye also are built together for the inhabitation of God through
[00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.040]   the Spirit.
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:48.400]   These verses follow, of course, the 19th verse in which the subject the apostle is dealing
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.400]   with here begins.
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:01:00.360]   Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints,
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.000]   and of the household of God.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.120]   And then come these verses, and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets,
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:15.940]   Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone.
[00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:22.660]   In other words, we come back again to consider this most important picture which the apostle
[00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:31.880]   uses here in order to convey to these Ephesian Christians a true conception of their position
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.360]   in the Christian church, and therefore a true conception of the nature of the Christian
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.460]   church herself.
[00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.720]   Now we have seen that the apostle uses three pictures.
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.800]   We have already dealt with two of them.
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.480]   The first was the picture of a state, a kingdom, a country.
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.360]   We are all member citizens of the kingdom of God.
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:02.460]   But secondly, he compares the church to a family, and we are all the children of God.
[00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.040]   We are members of the household of God.
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.180]   But even that was not enough.
[00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:15.100]   He goes on to this third picture which we begin to consider last Sunday morning.
[00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:22.460]   This picture of the church of God as a great building in which God dwells.
[00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:29.580]   Now it is obvious that the picture suggested itself to the apostle partly because of what
[00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:36.500]   he had just been saying in the earlier verses about the temple under the old dispensation.
[00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.420]   His great point is that the middle wall of partition between the Jews and the Gentiles
[00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.540]   had been broken down.
[00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:49.160]   Well now the middle wall of partition of course was to be found in the temple.
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:56.220]   The Gentiles were in the courts of the Gentiles, and there was a kind of wall that prevented
[00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.660]   their going in to the court of the people.
[00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:06.940]   And the people in turn were not allowed to go in to the holiest of all, and so on.
[00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.700]   Now he was thinking therefore in terms of a temple which had divided people.
[00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:18.180]   He says all that is gone, and there is a new temple.
[00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:24.100]   And God dwells in this new temple, the temple consisting of his own people.
[00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:31.340]   No more a Jewish temple that has gone once and forever, no longer Jew nor Gentile, barbarian
[00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.260]   nor Scythian, bond nor free, but all are one.
[00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.060]   There is this new thing.
[00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:42.220]   And the temple in which God now dwells is the church, his own people.
[00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.620]   Very well.
[00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.780]   Well now we began to consider it last Sunday morning, and I reminded you then, as I must
[00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.340]   again remind you this morning, that there are two great principles which we must hold
[00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:58.980]   very firmly in the forefront of our minds if we are really to follow this teaching.
[00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.820]   The apostle is out to show two things.
[00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:10.700]   One, the unity, the essential unity that must ever be true of the Christian church, and
[00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.140]   of all who are truly Christian.
[00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.540]   It's not a matter to argue about.
[00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.380]   It is something that God has made, and God has produced himself.
[00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:26.660]   In Christ he has made of twain one new man, this new thing, the church.
[00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.060]   And the unity is quite inevitable.
[00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:36.580]   The second thing, of course, and it follows from that is the privilege of our position.
[00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:37.580]   Very well.
[00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:43.180]   Now the apostle in this picture of the church as this temple, this holy building in which
[00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:49.820]   God takes up his residence, brings out those two things very clearly.
[00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.380]   And we began our examination of it last Sunday.
[00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.460]   We looked at it in general.
[00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:01.340]   We want to come on this morning to a more detailed consideration.
[00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:09.020]   The apostle taught us that the building is something that's going on.
[00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.660]   It's a lively, a living, an active process.
[00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.860]   "Groweth" is something that grows, and we're all fitly framed together.
[00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.540]   It's not mechanical.
[00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:25.580]   We must never think of unity in terms of mere mechanics or statistics, simply adding together.
[00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.180]   No, no, it's something vital.
[00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.740]   "Groweth" it's this living process.
[00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.020]   We also saw that it's holy.
[00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:41.420]   The apostle's not interested in size, he's interested in quality, holiness, holy temple
[00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:43.500]   in the Lord.
[00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:49.820]   And we saw likewise that the three persons of the blessed Trinity are always of necessity
[00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.500]   involved, as he brings it out here so clearly.
[00:05:53.500 --> 00:06:01.860]   God the Father in the Lord Jesus Christ through or by the Spirit.
[00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:08.620]   But as I indicated last Sunday, the apostle doesn't stop at mere general description.
[00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:13.260]   He looks at the temple as it were, and he first of all gives his general account of
[00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:14.260]   it.
[00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:20.300]   But this matter is so important in his estimation that he must come to details.
[00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:26.460]   He gives us the plans and the specifications concerning this building, this temple.
[00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:33.580]   And therefore, because the apostle takes this trouble to do this, we must deduce that he
[00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:39.060]   regarded it as a matter which was of the gravest importance.
[00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:46.420]   This whole question of the nature of the church, the unity of the church, is indeed a fundamental
[00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:48.340]   matter.
[00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:55.580]   Now the apostle deals with it in his own day and generation, because it was obviously very
[00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.700]   essential that he should do so.
[00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:03.740]   It is equally essential that you and I should do so today.
[00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:07.660]   The great word of today is the word unity.
[00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:13.000]   There is more talk and more preaching and more writing of books and articles about unity
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.940]   in the church today than possibly any other single subject.
[00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:24.260]   Indeed it is the main topic under discussion and under consideration.
[00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:28.860]   And therefore, whether we like it or not, it behoves us to be clear in our thinking
[00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:32.500]   concerning these matters.
[00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:36.180]   It is a very wrong thing for any Christian person to say, "Ah, well, of course I am
[00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:39.140]   simply concerned in my own personal experience.
[00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.660]   I am not concerned about these larger matters."
[00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:42.660]   You must be.
[00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:45.780]   You cannot live in isolation.
[00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:48.860]   We all live together, we have fellowship with one another.
[00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:53.460]   No man liveth unto himself, no man dieth unto himself.
[00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:59.540]   And indeed if we do not think about these matters, we shall find ourselves being influenced
[00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:04.300]   by others, and it may well end in disaster.
[00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:07.380]   Let me use an illustration.
[00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:13.100]   We are reading constantly in the newspapers these days that the real trouble in the industrial
[00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:18.220]   world with strikes and so on is very largely due to this.
[00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:19.700]   I do not know whether this is true or not.
[00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:23.420]   I am simply repeating what I have read in the press and you have read.
[00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:28.900]   We are told the trouble is due to this, that the vast majority of the members of the trades
[00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:34.700]   union simply do not take the trouble to go to the meetings and to vote.
[00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:40.180]   And the result is that a few keen persons who may be communists, they always go, and
[00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:44.740]   because they go and the others do not and allow it to pass in an indifferent manner,
[00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:49.740]   the whole direction is governed by just a handful of people, and all the others who
[00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:54.780]   may not really be in agreement have to abide by the decisions.
[00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:57.940]   It may well be true.
[00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:04.740]   The sheer slackness and indolence, the refusal to take an active interest, allows the position
[00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:07.220]   to go by default.
[00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:12.460]   Precisely the same thing will happen in the Christian church and often has happened.
[00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:17.140]   Because Christian people in a kind of indolence are saying they cannot be bothered and really
[00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:22.380]   cannot apply their minds to these things, allow things to be done for them by just a
[00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:25.580]   handful of officials.
[00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:32.420]   I say it is our duty as Christians to understand something of what the apostle teaches us here
[00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:38.620]   concerning this question of unity.
[00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:43.740]   Now let me give you some further reasons for that.
[00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:49.660]   There are many ways in which you can get a kind of unity, but what matters is a true
[00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:54.860]   unity which corresponds to this description.
[00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:59.460]   The Roman Catholic Church believes in unity of the churches more than anybody else.
[00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:01.460]   They are always saying that.
[00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:03.420]   The very word Catholic tells us that.
[00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:06.220]   It is the universal church.
[00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:10.980]   And the Roman Catholics are amazed that Protestants ever went out and that there have ever been
[00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:12.340]   any divisions at all.
[00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:17.340]   They say we should be one, the church should be united.
[00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:22.460]   No church preaches unity more than the Roman Catholic Church.
[00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:25.540]   But we know what they mean by that.
[00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:27.700]   They mean uniformity.
[00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:30.440]   They mean that we all become absorbed again.
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.780]   They mean that we all return to Rome.
[00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:36.300]   But the point is they are very interested in unity.
[00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:41.000]   So if we simply talk about unity and say that nothing matters but unity, well then I say
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.060]   that logically we all ought to go back into the Roman Catholic Church.
[00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:51.780]   If you put unity first, if you say that nothing matters but unity, they call themselves Christians
[00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:53.700]   as we do, very well then.
[00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:56.460]   If we are all Christians together, why separate, why be different?
[00:10:56.460 --> 00:11:00.540]   Let's all be one, let's all become Roman Catholics.
[00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:05.660]   But of course when it's put like that we don't like it, do we?
[00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:10.680]   No, but when precisely the same argument is used within Protestantism, we think it's
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:13.120]   a very wonderful argument.
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:16.880]   But the principle is still precisely the same.
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.480]   You don't start with unity.
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:23.300]   Unity is something that results from something else.
[00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:25.760]   You can't create unity.
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:30.560]   Take for instance this picture that the Apostle has used about a family.
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:36.320]   The unity between the members of the family is not something created, artificial.
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:40.680]   The unity is inevitable because of their relationship.
[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:43.680]   And every form of unity is the same.
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.400]   Unity is a result.
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:47.240]   You don't start with unity.
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:55.720]   Unity is something that is in existence because certain fundamental positions are being observed.
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:59.440]   Or let me give you another illustration.
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:05.440]   Did you read in the papers not long ago of how they celebrated the tenth anniversary
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:11.360]   of the founding of the United Nations Organization, UNO?
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:18.000]   Well in connection with that they had a wonderful meeting which they called a festival of faith.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:25.800]   And the festival of faith consisted of this, that there was a great service in which Jews
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:34.400]   and Mohammedans and Buddhists and Confucianists and Christians all took part together in the
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:40.560]   same service and recited the same prayers together.
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:41.840]   Unity.
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:44.360]   The argument you see was this.
[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:47.920]   And oh how often is the argument used today.
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:51.480]   They say we all believe in the same God.
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:54.880]   The Mohammedan, the Hindu, the Buddhist.
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:57.240]   We all believe in the same God.
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:01.000]   They say you know truth is like a great mountain.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.200]   There's the one summit but there are many ways of going up.
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.280]   Why should you say that you alone are right?
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:11.200]   What right of Christians to say that they alone are right and all the others are wrong?
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:16.400]   Doesn't matter which way you climb up the mountain as long as you get to the top.
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:20.520]   So let's all come together in a great festival of the faiths.
[00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:23.320]   A great congress, world congress of religion.
[00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:24.320]   The same God?
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:26.920]   Well therefore why haggle about these things?
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:30.760]   They say it's a wrong spirit you know.
[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:35.200]   That's the sort of argument that is being used.
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:39.480]   I wonder sometimes what such people would think of the Apostle Paul if he were alive
[00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:41.200]   today.
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:44.520]   I wonder what many in the Christian church would say about him.
[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:46.840]   Did you notice what he said to the Galatians?
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:47.840]   Listen to him.
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:52.080]   Though we are an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.080]   we have preached.
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:55.080]   Let him be a curser.
[00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:56.080]   Ha!
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:59.600]   They'd say, impossible individualist, isolationist.
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:01.840]   He alone is right, everybody else is wrong.
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:02.840]   He won't come in.
[00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:05.920]   He's always standing out on points.
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:13.160]   Don't you see my friends that through allowing ourselves to be influenced by vague general
[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:20.440]   talk we become terribly unscriptural at times without realizing what we are doing?
[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:23.040]   No, no, we must observe the plans and specifications.
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:27.840]   It's not you shouting unity and saying this is the great thing we'll all get together.
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:33.760]   There's something infinitely more important, truth.
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:38.200]   For a unity which isn't based upon truth is false.
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.920]   It's man-made.
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.160]   It's not God's plan.
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:43.160]   It's unreal.
[00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:44.160]   It's spurious.
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:52.000]   Very well then, I say, the apostle now is teaching us all that in this way.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:59.640]   Builded, he says, upon the foundation.
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:04.600]   You see, he brings us to the vital thing at once.
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:08.600]   There can be no true building without a right foundation.
[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:11.880]   You've got to start with foundation, says Paul.
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:15.240]   You can't talk of a building without knowing something about its foundation.
[00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:20.360]   That's absolutely vital and central.
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:25.360]   And therefore, because of the modern tragic confusion, I have to ask you to bear with
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:31.840]   me while I go into detailed descriptions and definitions and expositions of exactly what
[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:33.120]   the apostle says.
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:40.400]   The foundation of the apostles and prophets.
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:45.600]   Now here is the only basis of true unity.
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.680]   What's he mean?
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:52.040]   Well, I've got to ask the question, what's an apostle?
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:54.280]   What is an apostle?
[00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:58.800]   Because I can't understand this whole matter of unity unless I know what an apostle is
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:03.320]   and what a prophet is, because the church is founded on the foundation of the apostles
[00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:04.320]   and prophets.
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:07.560]   Well, these are the essential points about an apostle.
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:13.400]   An apostle was one who had to have seen the risen Lord.
[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:20.080]   By definition, an apostle is one who is a witness to the resurrection because he has
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.440]   seen the risen Lord.
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:27.640]   Now that, you see, was one of the qualifications of Paul himself.
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:30.280]   He saw the risen Lord on the way to Damascus.
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:33.480]   If he hadn't, he could never have been an apostle.
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:36.720]   He might have been a preacher, he might have been a prophet, he might have been a great
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:41.880]   teacher, but he could never have been an apostle if he hadn't seen the Lord on the road to
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:43.280]   Damascus.
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:47.840]   So that is why you remember in writing to the Corinthians, he says that he himself is
[00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:50.240]   as one born out of due time.
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:52.640]   He didn't see the risen Lord with all the rest of them.
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:58.360]   He had this special manifestation to himself in order to make him an apostle.
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:02.320]   And you remember he puts it in a phrase at the beginning of the tenth chapter of the
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:03.960]   first epistle to the Corinthians.
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:14.200]   "Moreover, brethren," he says, "that I know at the ninth chapter, rather, am I not an apostle?
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.560]   Am I not free?
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:21.240]   Have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord?"
[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:22.320]   That's it.
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:26.000]   That's the proof that he's an apostle.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:33.880]   But not only that, an apostle was one who was specially called and designated and sent
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:38.960]   as a preacher of the gospel by the risen Lord himself.
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:42.800]   That again is a vital part of the calling of an apostle.
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:47.160]   Read the twenty-sixth chapter of the book of Acts, and there you will find the account
[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:53.480]   of how the Lord himself commissioned the apostle Paul there and then on the road to Damascus.
[00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:58.680]   So the apostle is one who is specially commissioned by Christ, having seen him risen from the
[00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:03.440]   dead, to go out and preach the message.
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:08.080]   Not only that, the apostles were given a very special authority.
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:13.880]   They were given power to work miracles and to do various other things.
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:20.400]   And it was these that attested their authority as apostles.
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:23.520]   Now those are the three main characteristics of an apostle.
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:27.400]   You'll see in a moment how vital it is that we should bear all that in mind.
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:35.360]   Without those three things, no man is an apostle, or in any sort of apostolic succession.
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:37.080]   Well then that brings us to the prophets.
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:39.720]   What's a prophet?
[00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:43.040]   Now there's been a great deal of discussion about this.
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:48.280]   The older commentators all agree in saying that this word "prophet" is a reference
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:53.040]   to the Old Testament prophets.
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:57.600]   Those who prophesied of the coming of Christ, those who prophesied the coming of the kingdom,
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:01.740]   and in that sense laid a foundation.
[00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:06.160]   But then there is a great body of opinion on the other side and says, "No, this is
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:09.320]   not a reference to Old Testament prophets.
[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:16.400]   It is a reference to the New Testament prophets, the prophets in the New Testament church."
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:20.240]   And they say this must be the case for this reason.
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:24.000]   If the apostle had been thinking of Old Testament prophets, he would have said on the foundation
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.200]   of the prophets and apostles.
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:28.560]   The prophets came before the apostles.
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:33.240]   But he says on the foundation of the apostles and prophets.
[00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:38.440]   Therefore he's clearly thinking in New Testament terms, and indeed they say he does the same
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:43.800]   thing in the fifth verse of the third chapter where we read this, "Which in other ages
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:50.160]   was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:53.320]   and prophets by the Spirit."
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:58.260]   And again in the eleventh verse of the fourth chapter he says this, "He gave some apostles
[00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:04.720]   and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers."
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:10.200]   So on the basis of that they say, "This is patently a reference to the New Testament
[00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:14.800]   prophet, the prophet in the Christian church."
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:19.440]   Very well, that raises the question, what were these, what is a prophet, whether under
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:23.760]   the old dispensation or the new?
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:31.040]   And the answer is that a prophet is one who receives a direct message from God.
[00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:36.960]   One to whom truth is revealed directly by the Spirit, not as the result of reading the
[00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:43.520]   scripture or anything else, but a direct message given which he in turn is to impart to others.
[00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:50.800]   The apostle Paul defines it for us in 1 Corinthians 14, first verse, "He that prophesieth, he
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:21:00.640]   says, speaketh unto men to edification and exaltation and to comfort."
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:05.600]   And there is no doubt that in the Christian church in the early days there were these
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.600]   people called prophets.
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:12.280]   You see, they hadn't got the New Testament scriptures then, they hadn't the Gospels,
[00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:17.040]   they hadn't the Epistles, but there were these people who were given spiritual truth
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:21.120]   and understanding and were enabled to speak it.
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:24.840]   Now the prophet in the Old Testament of course did exactly the same.
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:28.640]   God revealed truth to him and enabled him to speak it.
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:31.400]   That's the characteristic of a prophet.
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:35.100]   What then is the apostle referring to here exactly when he says, "On the foundation
[00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:38.960]   of the apostles and prophets"?
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:43.480]   Well it seems to me that probably both things are true.
[00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:49.400]   He puts the apostles first because of their utter, absolute uniqueness.
[00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:55.040]   You get the same in Revelation 21, verse 14, where we read of the holy city, Jerusalem,
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:22:01.840]   coming down, and the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in these the names
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:06.040]   of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:12.440]   Very well then, we can take it that he is referring, if you like, to the Old Testament
[00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:21.520]   prophets and to the New Testament prophets in connection with the apostles.
[00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:26.840]   In what sense then is it true to say that the church is built and established and founded
[00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:34.600]   upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets?
[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:36.680]   And the answer is this.
[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:47.220]   It means partly the men themselves as believers, the men as those exercising faith.
[00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:53.520]   They after all were the first believers, the apostles and prophets.
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:23:00.160]   The first believers, and in that sense the whole superstructure goes up from them.
[00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:04.120]   There is no doubt at all that that is partly the meaning.
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:09.680]   That as they were the first to be laid there in this great building as kind of foundation
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:19.120]   stones, so it is right to refer to them as believers, as those exercising this faith
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:22.960]   in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:28.240]   And of course that in turn leads to the second thing, and probably this was more still in
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:31.400]   the mind of the apostle even than the first.
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:35.440]   The teaching of the apostles and prophets.
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:39.480]   That after all is the fundamental foundation.
[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:42.600]   None of us can come into the church without believing.
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:48.680]   It is as the result of believing that we derive all our benefits and are made what we are.
[00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:51.840]   The difference is between believers and unbelievers.
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:54.280]   Believers are not in the church, believers are in the church.
[00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:55.280]   Well what do they believe?
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:59.160]   Well they believe the teaching.
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:06.840]   So that the foundation in the last analysis is the teaching of the apostles and prophets,
[00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:08.260]   their doctrine.
[00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:11.120]   They taught of course what they believed themselves.
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:14.300]   They gave expression to the faith that they exercised.
[00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:18.120]   So the two things rarely become one.
[00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:22.680]   And therefore this is the vital thing for us to understand and to grasp at a time like
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:25.920]   this.
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:32.200]   What makes us members of the church, what makes us part of this great temple, this wonderful
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:41.520]   edifice that is being built, is our faith, is our acceptance of the teaching, the doctrine.
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:47.080]   Now this is the thing that is basic and fundamental.
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:51.280]   You see it was that about which the apostle wrote there in that first chapter of the epistle
[00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:52.280]   to the Galatians.
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:25:03.120]   "I marvel," he says, "that you were so soon removed."
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:09.160]   You notice how it's often been pointed out how abruptly he says it after his very preliminary
[00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:10.160]   salutation.
[00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:16.280]   He says, "I marvel that you were so soon removed from him that called you into the
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:25.200]   grace of Christ and to another gospel, which is not another, because there isn't another
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:28.000]   and there cannot be another."
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.120]   And oh how strongly he speaks.
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:34.640]   My dear friends, whether you and I like it or not, you know that Christianity is a most
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:37.720]   intolerant faith.
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:41.080]   It says this and this alone is right and it's true.
[00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:45.340]   And the apostle even says, "If any other men preach any other gospel unto you than
[00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:49.680]   that which we have preached, even though it be an angel from heaven, let him be accursed."
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:26:00.880]   There is no other gospel, other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid.
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:07.520]   In other words, the only basis of unity today as it was in the early church is the apostolic
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:11.320]   message.
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:14.360]   And whatever men may think or say, we must assert this.
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:17.600]   Let them call us intolerant, isolationists, say what they like.
[00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:22.440]   We take our stand with this man of God.
[00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:25.640]   It's not my opinion or anybody else's opinion that matters.
[00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:26.780]   What does the Word teach?
[00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:29.160]   What did the apostles teach?
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:31.100]   I know nothing apart from that.
[00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:35.360]   It isn't modern knowledge or modern research or modern understanding or modern ideas of
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:36.360]   God.
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:37.360]   No, no.
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:38.840]   It's what these men taught.
[00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:42.320]   It's the only gospel.
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:45.940]   And clearly it's something that can be defined.
[00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:49.600]   If it can't be defined, how could the apostle reprimand the Galatians?
[00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:51.200]   How could he call them back?
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.120]   How could he ask them certain questions?
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:55.240]   They knew what he taught.
[00:26:55.240 --> 00:27:00.240]   And it can be known, this idea that Christianity is so marvelous that you can't define it,
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:06.160]   that it's just a wonderful spirit which can't be reduced to propositions, is a denial of
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:07.920]   the New Testament.
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:13.320]   The epistles were written in order that we might know what we are to believe and what
[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:15.480]   exactly we are to subscribe to.
[00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:17.120]   Well, what is it?
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:21.040]   Well, none of us can plead ignorance of this teaching.
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:26.240]   It's all in this second chapter of the epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:34.640]   And this is the foundation, that man by nature is dead in trespasses and in sins, that he
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:39.240]   is under the wrath of God.
[00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:40.760]   It's the apostle who says it.
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:43.600]   I'm not saying it, it's the apostle.
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:50.120]   And therefore I say to you that unless you believe that man by nature is dead in trespasses
[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:57.560]   and sins, and that there is such a thing as the wrath of God upon sin, whatever else you
[00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:03.480]   may be, you are not in this holy temple in the Lord in which God dwells.
[00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:07.000]   This is the foundation.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.640]   But thank God it doesn't stop at that.
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:12.320]   It goes on to tell us about the grace of God.
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:17.360]   It goes on to tell us about the Lord Jesus Christ, his person and his work.
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:21.520]   It tells us that he is the only begotten Son of God.
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:25.280]   Though a man calls himself a Christian, if he doesn't believe in the deity of Christ,
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:27.920]   I say he's not a Christian.
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:29.680]   I must be intolerant.
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:32.480]   I can't afford to compromise at this point.
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:39.320]   If Christ isn't the Son of God, I am yet in my sins and I shall go to hell.
[00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:41.960]   And his work.
[00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:45.400]   Haven't we noticed as we've worked our way through this second chapter, and I've
[00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:50.880]   taken time deliberately because we can't afford to skim over these things, the blood
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:54.760]   of Christ.
[00:28:54.760 --> 00:29:04.000]   It is by his death, by his sacrificial death, by his substituting himself for us to bear
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.280]   the punishment of our sins.
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:08.520]   It is by the blood of Christ.
[00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:09.520]   Listen to it.
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:14.840]   "Wherefore remember that he being in times past Gentiles in the flesh, who were called
[00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:20.080]   uncircumcision, that he were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:25.640]   and strangers from the covenant of promise, having no hope and without God in the world.
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:33.640]   But now in Christ Jesus, ye who sometimes were far off, are made nigh by the blood of
[00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:35.760]   Christ."
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:38.160]   And yet people scoff at the blood of Christ.
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:41.080]   There are people calling themselves Christians who scoff at it.
[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:45.640]   There are leaders in big denominations in sections of the church who say that it's
[00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:48.760]   heresy to talk about a substitutionary atonement.
[00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:51.320]   But I'm asked to be one in fellowship with them.
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:52.320]   How can I be?
[00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:53.320]   It's impossible.
[00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:55.440]   I have no choice.
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:56.440]   This is foundational.
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:30:00.120]   The blood of Christ.
[00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:04.200]   He bore my sins in his own body on the tree.
[00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:07.000]   It is by that alone that I am delivered.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:13.040]   And then the power of God in regeneration, the gift of the Spirit, union with Christ.
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:15.040]   That's the doctrine.
[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:19.600]   That's all that the apostle has been teaching us in this wonderful chapter.
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:26.320]   Very well then, my friends.
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:32.120]   That is the foundation of the apostles and prophets.
[00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:35.880]   Not a vague talk about Christianity.
[00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:40.280]   Not a wonderful spirit in which we all, loving one another, get together and are not concerned
[00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:41.280]   about definitions.
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:46.200]   Well, I say, if you want that kind of unity, you can have it, my friend.
[00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:52.360]   But the question is, when the day comes and the judgment arrives, you will find that what
[00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:57.640]   the apostle said in writing to the Corinthians, "Other foundation can no man lay than that
[00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:00.640]   which is laid."
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:06.160]   He preached Jesus Christ and him crucified to the exclusion of everything else.
[00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:07.160]   He's intolerant.
[00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:10.200]   Don't listen to that other teaching, he says to the Galatians.
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.200]   It's spurious.
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:12.200]   Why?
[00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:13.200]   It isn't a gospel.
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:17.200]   It's a denial of the gospel.
[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:23.720]   The foundation of the apostles and prophets.
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:28.960]   We either accept their teaching and their message or else we don't.
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:35.920]   Very well then, let me draw some very modern deductions from this doctrine.
[00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:44.960]   The first is this, you see, that the Church is founded not on the apostle Peter only,
[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:49.240]   but on the apostles and prophets, all the apostles and the prophets.
[00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:54.280]   That's our answer to Roman Catholicism.
[00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:57.280]   And it is indeed as simple as that.
[00:31:57.280 --> 00:32:01.000]   "Ah, but," says someone, "what about Matthew 16?"
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.120]   "Et says Areophilipi."
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:08.120]   When our Lord says, "Thou art Peter, and on this rock I will build my church," it
[00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:10.920]   must have been Peter only.
[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:14.240]   But can't you see that it was just what I was saying just now, that it's Peter's
[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:15.240]   confession?
[00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:17.760]   Peter had just made his great confession.
[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:21.640]   Our Lord had turned to the disciples and had said, "Whom do men say that I, the Son of
[00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:22.640]   Man am?"
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:29.360]   And some said, "That thou art Elias," and some, "John the Baptist," and some, "one
[00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:30.360]   of the prophets."
[00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:33.760]   "But whom do ye say?" said our Lord.
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:38.840]   And Peter put himself forward as the spokesman, as was his habit, and said, "Thou art the
[00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:43.120]   Christ, the Son of the living God."
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:47.960]   He replied saying, "Blessed art thou, Simon, the son of Jonas, for flesh and blood hath
[00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:51.520]   not revealed this unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven."
[00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:52.520]   What is it?
[00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:58.200]   "Ah, he has seen the truth, he confesses it on this rock."
[00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:02.240]   "I will build my church."
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:04.960]   The confession, the belief, the faith.
[00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:06.560]   And it isn't only true of Peter.
[00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:09.920]   You see, the apostle Paul doesn't deny the teaching of our Lord.
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:12.360]   Of course, these other people say that he does.
[00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:16.720]   They contrast the teaching of Christ and the teaching of Paul, but there's no contradiction.
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:24.400]   The apostles and prophets, all of them, not only Peter, but this confession that was first
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:32.120]   made by the apostles and prophets, it is the only foundation of the Christian church.
[00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:37.720]   And therefore we cannot be one with those who say that it's all on Peter alone, and
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:41.080]   that everything depends upon Peter.
[00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:45.000]   It's a false basis.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:52.160]   But it's equally important for us to make this second deduction, that in the light of
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:58.800]   what we have seen to be the truth about apostles and prophets, there can be no repetition of
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:00.360]   apostles and prophets.
[00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:02.720]   They are the foundation.
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:04.600]   You don't repeat a foundation.
[00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:07.600]   A foundation is once and forever.
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:12.720]   And therefore all talk about apostolic succession in some peculiar manner is a denial of our
[00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:16.720]   text this morning.
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:19.000]   There are no special successors of the apostles.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.080]   Indeed, there are no successors to the apostles.
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:26.520]   An apostle is a man who has seen the risen Lord and can therefore be a witness to the
[00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:27.520]   resurrection.
[00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:31.080]   Are there such people today?
[00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:37.560]   An apostle is one who is specially commissioned by the Lord himself in a visible manner.
[00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:40.160]   Are there such today?
[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:45.400]   He is given these special powers, miracles and others, and infallibility, in order that
[00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:48.000]   he may preach and teach infallibly.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.480]   Are there such today?
[00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:55.440]   And yet you see, in all this talk and argument about reunion, this is the big thing, apostolic
[00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:56.440]   succession.
[00:34:56.440 --> 00:35:01.120]   Therefore, nonconformists, free church ministers, must all be ordained again by a man who is
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:05.200]   a direct successor of the apostle, and you can't have unity without that, you know they
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:09.760]   say, and you can't have communion together.
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:14.600]   You see how important it is to study the Scriptures, my friends.
[00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:17.360]   There is no such thing as apostolic succession.
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:22.520]   By definition, it is something which is a sheer impossibility.
[00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:26.960]   You can have a sacerdotal succession, you can have a succession of men who appoint one
[00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:31.800]   another in perpetuity, that isn't what I read in the Scriptures.
[00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:35.080]   There is no such thing as apostolic succession.
[00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:40.080]   And therefore all this talk that you can't have unity without a reordination or about
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:48.200]   a man doing something or other is a denial of this postulate.
[00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:55.560]   It is faith alone and subscription to the truth that brings one into the building.
[00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:59.480]   That brings me to my third deduction which I put in this form.
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:05.680]   Obviously there can be no addition to this foundation.
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:09.240]   In the matter of teaching, I mean.
[00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:15.540]   If the foundation is the teaching of the apostles, I say you can't add to it.
[00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:21.120]   So I do not believe in the immaculate conception.
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:26.440]   I do not believe in the assumption of the Virgin Mary.
[00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:31.080]   I do not believe in all these other things that the Roman Church has added and other
[00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:34.200]   churches have added.
[00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:38.680]   You can't add to a foundation, you can't take from a foundation.
[00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:42.360]   Here is a corpus of truth, here is a body of doctrine.
[00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:44.440]   We either take it all or we take none.
[00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:49.720]   You can't add, you can't subtract, you can't touch a foundation.
[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:52.160]   You may think that you can, but you cannot of course.
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:56.400]   What you're doing is just to put yourself outside the building.
[00:36:56.400 --> 00:37:04.600]   The foundation has been laid once and forever and it can never be repeated.
[00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:11.680]   God is the builder and he builds upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets.
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:17.120]   So that the next very practical deduction is this one.
[00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:21.840]   It is not enough for us just to say that we are Christian or that we want to be Christian
[00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:27.960]   and that surely nothing matters except that we all say we are Christian.
[00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:32.640]   The vital question is, my friend, what's your belief?
[00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:36.360]   What do you believe?
[00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:41.280]   You can't be a Christian without knowing what you believe.
[00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:45.280]   It's impossible.
[00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:48.760]   It is the truth that brings us to God.
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:52.920]   It is by the truth we are sanctified.
[00:37:52.920 --> 00:38:00.400]   It is only as we know the truth concerning our blessed Lord and Saviour and ourselves
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:07.280]   and our need and what God has done in his grace that we can be parts and portions of
[00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:12.360]   this great edifice.
[00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:17.800]   And therefore my last deduction must be this one.
[00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:28.400]   Is it not obvious that to talk in terms of size or of organization or anything else is
[00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:35.320]   extremely dangerous in these matters?
[00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:48.440]   The unity of the Church is the result of two things, purity of doctrine, purity of life.
[00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:52.040]   It is a holy temple in the Lord.
[00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:57.440]   It is a habitation of God.
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:04.720]   It is on the foundation of the apostles and prophets.
[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:12.640]   And oh, how he hastens to add this, built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets,
[00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:23.160]   Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone.
[00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:25.000]   And what is the chief cornerstone?
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:30.360]   Let me just read a definition to you.
[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:38.720]   A cornerstone is the primary foundation stone at the angle of the structure by which the
[00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:47.680]   architect fixes a standard for the bearings of the walls and cross walls throughout.
[00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:54.120]   That's the meaning of the chief cornerstone.
[00:39:54.120 --> 00:40:00.760]   It not only holds together all these other subsidiary foundation stones, it binds them
[00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:04.120]   together and it binds all the walls together.
[00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:10.160]   It's at the corner and everything is supported by it and everything is welded together by
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:14.680]   it.
[00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:20.120]   And the chief cornerstone is Jesus Christ himself.
[00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:27.920]   Isaiah prophesied this when he said, "Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation, a stone, a
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:35.760]   tridestone, a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation."
[00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:40.000]   And the apostle Peter, you remember, quotes that in his first epistle in the second chapter
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.600]   and the sixth verse.
[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:47.160]   But you remember that our Lord himself said this, "The stone which the builders rejected
[00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:58.920]   the same is become the head of the corner," referring to himself and to his glorious death
[00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:00.800]   and his triumphant resurrection.
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:06.720]   "They're rejecting me," he says, "but they will find that I become the headstone
[00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:13.200]   of the corner, that I am the very basis of the whole building, binding all together,
[00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:21.160]   containing the weight of the entire superstructure."
[00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:26.160]   There is no unity apart from Jesus Christ.
[00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:30.280]   It is our relationship to him, it is our dependence upon him.
[00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:34.400]   He is central, he is vital, he is all-important.
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:41.360]   I repeat again these striking phrases, "In whom all the building fitly framed together
[00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:50.000]   groweth into an holy temple, in the Lord, in whom ye also are builded together for an
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:57.640]   habitation of God through the Spirit."
[00:41:57.640 --> 00:42:06.280]   So that the practical question we ask ourselves at the close of this service is this, "Do
[00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:11.800]   I know what I believe about the Lord Jesus Christ?
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:14.920]   Do I know him?
[00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:22.960]   Am I in him, in this vital relationship?"
[00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:29.680]   God willing, I hope to go on next Sunday morning to help you to answer that question, because
[00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:36.400]   the apostle even deals with that in detail.
[00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:42.640]   "In whom the whole building fitly framed together," that's it.
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:48.600]   If that isn't true of us, we are not in it.
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:56.640]   But this morning, as I say, the vital question is the foundation.
[00:42:56.640 --> 00:43:05.400]   Are we based solidly this morning upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets?
[00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:10.200]   Are you just interested in a vague, nebulous Christianity that says, "Aye, but you mustn't
[00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:13.720]   go and divide by arguing about doctrine that separates"?
[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:16.280]   Is that your position?
[00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:21.760]   It was certainly not the position of the men who said, "Though we are an angel from heaven,
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:26.640]   preach any other gospel, let him be accursed."
[00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:31.520]   We must know in whom we have believed.
[00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:34.800]   We must know what we believe.
[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:41.520]   This apostle speaks of "my gospel," and there is no other gospel.
[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:42.520]   Is it yours?
[00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:48.240]   Were it not for his atoning, sacrificial, substitutionary death, you would still be
[00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:49.240]   there.
[00:43:49.240 --> 00:44:01.400]   But that he has died for you, given himself for you and for your sins, and by the power
[00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:08.320]   of his Holy Spirit has regenerated you, has quickened you, has caused you to be raised
[00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:13.840]   again and that you are seated even now in the heavenly places with Christ because you
[00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:28.160]   are in him and joined to him by the grace of God on the foundation of the apostles and
[00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:29.160]   prophets.
[00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:30.160]   Amen.
[00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:35.040]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
