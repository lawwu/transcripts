[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.320]   We are dealing at the present time, as most of you will recall, with the words found in
[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:16.320]   Paul's epistle to the Romans in chapter 10 and from verse 14 to verse 17. From verse
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.600]   14 to verse 17 in the 10th chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans. "How then shall they
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.520]   call on him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in him of whom
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.800]   they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher? And how shall they preach
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.940]   except they be sent? As it is written, 'How beautiful are the feet of them that preach
[00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:45.160]   the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of good things.' But they have not all obeyed
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:53.400]   the gospel. For Isaiah saith, 'Lord, who hath believed our report?' So then faith cometh
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:01:02.960]   by hearing, and hearing by the word of God." Now all that, you see, is a continuation of
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.200]   the statement made by the apostle in verse 13, where he says, "Whosoever shall call upon
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:14.640]   the name of the Lord shall be saved." That quotation from the prophet Joel. And then
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.640]   he says, "Well now then, that being the way of salvation, not by works but by simply calling
[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.520]   upon the name of the Lord, acknowledging our utter hopelessness and complete hopelessness
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.040]   and impotence, we can do nothing but call on the name of the Lord." Well now the question
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.880]   is, how can one do that? Well it's obvious, he says, that one can't do that unless one
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.280]   has heard about the Lord. You can't believe in him unless you've heard of him. And you
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.840]   can't hear of him unless somebody has preached him to you. And no one preaches unless he
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:56.640]   is sent, and so on. Now I have suggested that the apostle answers
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:04.000]   this question as to how one becomes the whosoever who calls upon the name of the Lord by saying
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.080]   that two things are essential. One is that the Lord should be preached, be presented.
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:18.160]   And the second is that that presentation of the truth concerning him should be made effective
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:25.600]   or efficacious. In other words, I suggested last week that in verses 14 and 15 you have
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:34.120]   what is called the general proclamation or offer of the gospel. And in verses 16 and
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:41.640]   17 he deals with the question of how it becomes efficacious. The general call, the efficacious
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:48.520]   call. The general call is made to all. It is only efficacious or effective in the case
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:56.440]   of some. And the apostle here deals with those two aspects of the matter. We've seen how
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:02.280]   he works out that first one. He takes us through these various steps and points out how no
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.760]   one would ever have heard of the Lord unless it had been God's ultimate will and purpose
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:14.680]   that the news concerning him should be spread abroad. And he shows by his quotation from
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:21.440]   Isaiah 52, 7 and Nahum 1, 5 that this was something that had been prophesied in the
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.800]   Old Testament where we read, "How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:36.000]   of peace and bring glad tidings of good things." Now, having seen the exact meaning of the
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.320]   passage in that way and having indicated that it's on the surface not an easy one, as
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:48.920]   the commentators are all agreed in pointing out, we have proceeded to say that it is a
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:56.160]   very, very important paragraph, this, because it contains within it teaching concerning
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:03.000]   some of the most vital and urgent aspects of the life of the Christian church. For instance,
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.240]   we were considering last week how this is in many ways the great charter for foreign
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:15.800]   mission work, or for any mission work. How shall they believe in him of whom they have
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:21.520]   not heard, and how shall they hear without a preacher? That's the great argument for
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:26.840]   sending people to different countries to preach the gospel or to make sure that in our own
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:33.680]   country that men and women have at inner it heard the good news concerning Christ and
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:40.720]   his salvation. Then I pointed out how that in turn raises in many people's mind the
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:47.000]   question as to the position of heathen who have never heard the message, and we have
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:54.900]   given the answer to that. And the same applies, of course, to infants who die before they
[00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:01.800]   become of any age and are capable of understanding at all. And we came to this conclusion that
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.960]   there is only one adequate answer to all that. It isn't that all the heathen who have never
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:13.680]   heard are all saved. It isn't that all infants dying soon after birth are saved, because
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.440]   if that were the case, as I pointed out in the case of the heathen, it would be a great
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:23.000]   disservice to them to send foreign missionaries to them. If they are saved because of their
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.880]   ignorance, well then to give them knowledge is a cause of their damnation in the case
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:32.600]   of some. And it's the same, of course, with infants. If all infants automatically are
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:37.640]   saved and go to heaven, well then it's a most unfortunate thing that we all didn't
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:42.320]   die when we were infants. You see, that is the inevitable implication. It would have
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:47.480]   been a good thing for all of us to die the moment we were born, according to that argument,
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:54.240]   which is monstrous and ridiculous. God meant us to grow and to develop. That is what happens
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:06:01.000]   to men. So there is only one adequate explanation, and that is that God in his own inscrutable
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:08.560]   and mysterious manner is able to make this truth concerning the Lord Jesus Christ known
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:15.200]   to whomsoever he wills, whether they be infants, heathen, adults, whatever they are, it doesn't
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:22.560]   matter. Nothing is impossible with God. And in other words, I've been trying to show
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:30.480]   that what the apostle is dealing with here is the normal and the customary manner whereby
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:37.200]   the news of salvation is spread. I gave you those quotations from those learned
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:41.360]   teachers in the church at the end last time in order to substantiate what I was saying
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:49.400]   to you, that we mustn't confine God to any one method. It is possible that God can give
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:56.120]   the illumination of the capacity and the knowledge to anybody, so that even men and women who
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:04.160]   may have died in a state of what we call insanity, we mustn't assume that they're lost. With
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:10.240]   God all things are possible, and he can give the knowledge and the enlightenment to whomsoever
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:16.320]   he wills at any time. It's a most comforting and a most glorious thought.
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:22.080]   Well now, there are other questions that arise in people's minds with regard to this matter
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:30.480]   of the preaching of the gospel. Some people often put this kind of question. They say,
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:37.080]   well now, if it is as you say, a matter that is determined solely by the love and by the
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:46.320]   will of God, why is any preaching at all necessary? A friend put that question to me last Friday
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:53.560]   night. It's a constant question that is so frequently put. When you read the ninth chapter
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:57.640]   of this epistle to the Romans, people often bring that question forward. They say, if
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:02.360]   this is something that is, as you say, altogether and entirely of God, then what's the point
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:08.240]   of preaching? Now, as people do have that difficulty, we've got to glance at it. And
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:17.160]   the answer again is this. This is God's customary and normal way of working, of bringing his
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:23.160]   purpose to pass. It isn't the only one, as I've shown you, but it is the one that he
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:32.200]   normally chooses to employ. Let me show what I mean by means of illustration.
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:43.920]   God is all-powerful. And if God so chose, he could cause food to rise from the ground
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:49.720]   immediately, directly, at any moment. But God in his eternal wisdom hasn't chosen to
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:55.160]   do that. What God has chosen to do is this, that men should have ploughs, and that they
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:09:00.800]   should plough the earth, and then that they should harrow it and break it up, they should
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:06.400]   sow the seed into it, and then smooth it over, and they do all that in the spring, or perhaps
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:11.980]   even earlier, but they don't get the harvest, they don't get the food, until you're over
[00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:18.840]   in the autumn. God has chosen to work through means, indirectly, and in that manner. Now
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:24.600]   he could have done it all suddenly and immediately, but he chooses not to do so. And it's exactly
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:30.600]   the same with this matter of the gospel, and bringing men to a knowledge of salvation.
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:35.200]   We must always say, as I was saying at the end last Friday night, that God is not tied
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:42.520]   to means. He can do it directly, and he undoubtedly does so, in the case of infants and heathens
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:48.880]   and people like that. But his normal method is this method, or if you prefer, another
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:56.600]   illustration. It's the whole question of miracles. God has the power to work a miracle,
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:03.320]   whenever he chooses to do so. But God doesn't keep life going by an endless succession or
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:10.240]   series of miracles. He only works miracles exceptionally. A miracle is exceptional. God
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:17.560]   normally works through the laws of nature, cause and effect. But at times, he acts independently
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:23.120]   of that, and that's what a miracle is. A miracle is not a breaking of the laws of nature. It
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:29.520]   is God choosing, at a given point, for a given purpose, to act apart from his own laws that
[00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:36.440]   he has placed in nature. So a miracle is an exceptional action. The normal is for God
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:43.000]   to use the means that he himself has brought into existence. Now it's exactly like that
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:49.760]   with this matter. God has chosen that the gospel should be known, and that men and women
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:56.440]   should be brought to salvation by this method of preaching the gospel.
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:01.920]   In other words, for me to sum up the argument, if people say to you, "Well, if God determines
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:08.960]   who is to be saved, why do you need preaching?" Just say this to them, "God ordains the means
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:16.880]   as well as the end." He doesn't only ordain the end, he ordains the means, or the method,
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:23.720]   which brings that end to pass. So there is no contradiction at this point at all. It
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:29.400]   is the God who determines the end, who has determined and decided that these are the
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:35.720]   means that are normally implied. There's that question.
[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:44.160]   Then another question arises. The apostle here talks about preaching. So someone may
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:51.840]   say, "Well, are we to assume therefore, or to conclude, that the only way is by means
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:12:01.000]   of preaching this word? What about reading the word? Is it not possible for a man to
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:07.680]   come to salvation as the result of reading the word on his own? Is the method of salvation
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:15.400]   confined to the preaching of the word?" Well again, the answer is the same. It is not confined
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:24.280]   to preaching only. There are instances of men and women who've been saved by reading
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:31.120]   the word on their own. Very well then, what do we conclude about this aspect of the matter?
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:36.920]   Well, I want to say the same thing once more. That it seems perfectly clear from the teaching
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:45.120]   of the scriptures that God's ordained, common, customary, ordinary method is by means of
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:55.320]   preaching. But it doesn't exclude the possibility of a man being saved by means of reading the
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:13:01.560]   word. The truth is in the word. And some people have come to salvation almost, it appears
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:06.920]   to the outside world, accidentally, by casually picking up a Bible, opening it at a given
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:12.720]   passage, immediately their attention is focused on a word which is used of the Spirit to their
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:19.920]   salvation there and then. This does happen. What the apostle says doesn't exclude that.
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:25.800]   What he's saying is that the normal, customary method of God is through preaching.
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:32.360]   Now I must digress at this point and look into that matter a little bit further. And
[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:39.920]   I'm doing so because I feel constrained and compelled to do so. It's important that we
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:47.200]   should always apply the teaching of the scriptures. And here, I feel, is a point, again, that
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:53.800]   has a great deal of relevance at this present time. In this way, we are living in days when
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:59.960]   preaching is not as popular as it once was. We've got to face that. We're living in an
[00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:08.160]   age which doesn't believe in preaching, as former ages have done. We are living in an
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:16.440]   age which talks a lot about reading. I know that there are aspects of modern life which
[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:21.000]   doesn't even read. Modern life is so muddled. But it's perfectly clear that preaching is
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:29.720]   at a discount and that people like to read rather than listen to sermons and to addresses.
[00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:35.240]   There is a reaction, undoubtedly, against the historic preaching of the Christian church
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:41.640]   at the present time. You get it in the form of simply tolerating ten minutes, quarter
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:46.800]   of an hour, twenty minutes address. It isn't called sermon, even address. Some remarks
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:53.600]   are made and so on. That is the modern attitude. And I believe it's a very serious matter.
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:15:00.080]   It's a part of the whole general reaction of the modern man which affects even the people
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:09.920]   of God. I have sometimes ventured to describe this attitude as a kind of religious Baldwinism.
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:16.480]   Why do I call it religious Baldwinism? Well, that's of course because of the well-known
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:22.680]   views and teaching of the Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, who was Prime Minister in the thirties.
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:27.200]   He became Prime Minister, first of all, in the twenties. And he became Prime Minister
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:35.920]   on a slogan. And the slogan was this, that he, coming as he did, after a coalition government
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:42.680]   of brilliant men like Lloyd George and Winston Churchill and people like that, he put himself
[00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:50.000]   forward as not a great speaker, but an honest man. Not a brilliant man, but a man who could
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.640]   be trusted. And he didn't believe in speaking. He believed in actions. He believed in honesty.
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:16:01.160]   Now, that's what I mean by Baldwinism. That came in. And my only comment about that, which
[00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:06.600]   is my illustration, is this. We came to the second great world war, and many of us thanked
[00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:12.840]   God that we'd got a Prime Minister who could speak. And I think we learned, some of us,
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:17.920]   that perhaps the speaking of that man was as great a contribution to ultimate victory
[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:23.880]   as was the actual fighting of the soldiers. But you see, there is this tendency to discount
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:31.760]   the preaching. And we want to read quietly and at leisure, and so on. So, it seems to
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:36.080]   me to be important that we should realize that the Bible puts a great emphasis and stress
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:43.000]   upon preaching. Preaching is God's normal method, says the apostle. That's what he's
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:51.240]   saying. How shall they hear without a preacher? And I want to show why it is that the Bible
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:57.360]   undoubtedly puts preaching before reading. And I think the modern Christian needs to
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:04.760]   know something about this. Preaching, after all, is that which is of being ordained by
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:14.280]   God. It is God who has ordained that through the foolishness of preaching, the thing preached,
[00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:20.720]   that men should be saved. So he called apostles, and prophets, and evangelists, and preachers,
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:31.280]   and teachers. Pastors and teachers. Now why do I say that it is important for us to realize
[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:38.640]   the truth concerning preaching as against reading? Why do we come together like this?
[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:44.200]   Why do we come to listen to preaching on Sunday, wherever you may happen to be going? Why don't
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:49.000]   we all stay at home reading the Bible, or reading books about the Bible? Why don't
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:56.440]   we do that? Why is it important that we should come together and listen to a preacher? Well,
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:18:00.400]   it seems to me there are quite a number of answers that are suggested in the Bible with
[00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:09.800]   respect to this matter. And one of them is this one. That though the Word is here before
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:17.680]   us, and in a language that we can understand, and though as Christians we have all received
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:24.640]   the Holy Spirit and he is in us, it does not follow that we are therefore competent in
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:30.400]   and of ourselves without any aid to arrive at a true knowledge and understanding of the
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:35.600]   Word of God. Now let me give you two examples of what I
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:40.680]   mean. Take what we are told in the last chapter of Luke's Gospel, of our Lord speaking to
[00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:48.200]   the two men on the way to Emmaus. Here were two men absolutely cast down. And our Lord
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:52.360]   came to them and said, "O fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:58.560]   have spoken! Ought not Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory?
[00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:04.200]   And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:10.480]   the things concerning himself." And you remember it ended in their eyes being opened
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:15.440]   in the house, and then when our Lord had left them they said one to another, "Did not
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:22.000]   our heart burn within us while he talked to us by the way, and while he opened to us the
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.720]   scriptures?" The whole trouble with the Jews in a sense
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:32.640]   was this. They had their scriptures, they read them every Sunday, but they didn't
[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:39.080]   understand them. And their own teachers didn't help them. There was a veil over their minds
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:45.400]   and over their eyes. That was their whole tragedy. They had the scriptures, but that
[00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:50.440]   isn't enough on its own. But says somebody, what about the statements in the first epistle
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:56.680]   of John, in the second chapter, verses 20 and 27, where it says that he hath an anointing
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:20:01.760]   from that holy one, and he know all things, and he have no need that any men should instruct
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:09.320]   him? What about that, says somebody? Well, the answer is this. The apostle cannot possibly
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:14.640]   mean there that because a man is a Christian he doesn't need any instruction, because
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:20.840]   in writing to them that very epistle and saying that, he was giving them instruction. He was
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:25.560]   doing the very thing, as all the apostles in writing the epistles were doing the same
[00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:33.720]   thing. No, what he means there is that there is an ability in all Christians to receive
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:39.200]   spiritual instruction. That's what he means. He cannot mean the other thing, otherwise
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:43.840]   it would be a condemnation of the very epistle that John himself was writing, and every other
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:52.760]   New Testament epistle. No, that isn't the answer. It is rather, as I say, that our anxiety
[00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:58.120]   to know the truth even is not enough. Let me give you one other example of this self-same
[00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:03.160]   thing, which always seems to me to be interesting and instructive. It's the case of the Ethiopian
[00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:09.000]   eunuch on his way back from Jerusalem. And you remember he was returning and sitting
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.600]   in his chariot reading Isaiah the prophet. And the spirit said unto Philip the evangelist,
[00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:19.320]   Go near and join thyself to this chariot. And Philip ran hither to him and heard him
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:28.640]   read the prophet Isaiah and said, Understandest thou what thou readest? And he said, How can
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:34.960]   I except some men should guide me? And he desired, Philip, that he would come up and
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:40.480]   sit with him. Now there is the position. Here he is with the truth in front of him. He doesn't
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:45.400]   understand it. He needs help. He needs a teacher. He needs an expositor. He needs someone to
[00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:51.520]   preach to. And of course the account goes on to tell us how Philip did this very thing.
[00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:57.280]   Then Philip opened his mouth and began at the same scripture and preached unto him Jesus.
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:03.520]   And as the result of this preaching he came to a saving faith.
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:13.280]   Now that, you see, is God's normal method. And that is why, as we are told in Ephesians
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:19.880]   4, he has given these various gifts to the church. He gave some apostles, some prophets,
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:24.520]   some evangelists, some pastors and teachers. What for? For the perfecting of the saints,
[00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:31.120]   for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ, till we all come in
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:35.360]   the unity of faith and the knowledge of the Son of God, and to a perfect man, and to the
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:41.920]   measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. Very well. Those instances show us
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:45.960]   the need of preaching. It isn't enough that you've got the word and that you've got the
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:52.800]   spirit in you. You still need this further help and this further aid.
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:58.240]   Why should this be so? Well, it's a very difficult question to answer then. But you know, there
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:03.080]   was a man who lived in America in the last century called Phillips Brooks, and he gave
[00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:08.200]   some famous lectures on preaching. And he used a phrase which seems to me to be very
[00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:15.920]   important in this connection. What is preaching? Well, he said, "Preaching is truth mediated
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:25.520]   through personality." Truth, it must always be truth, but mediated through personality.
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:35.160]   What does that mean? Well, it means this, that God can use everything about the preacher
[00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:42.000]   in order to bring the truth home. I say God can do so. When the preacher tries to do so,
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:50.920]   it is thoroughly bad. It's meretricious. It's even worse. But God can use everything pertaining
[00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:56.440]   to a man. The classical example, of course, of this is a man like George Whitefield, whom
[00:23:56.440 --> 00:24:04.080]   God endowed with so many gifts in order that he could use his personality. The whole man
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:10.280]   was involved in the act of preaching. And God can use the man as he uses the word in
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:15.360]   order to produce his desired end. And the history of the church shows that, of course,
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:21.560]   so abundantly. How God has given men gifts of mind and intellect and understanding and
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:27.000]   insight into the truth and vice and appearance and a thousand and one other things, as it
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:33.060]   were. All of them working together under the power of the Spirit to make a man an effective
[00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:38.200]   preacher and effective in the service of God and in the salvation of souls.
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:43.160]   Now, all this comes into this question. You say, "But, R, why can't I do it quite as
[00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:48.640]   well reading a tome?" And my answer is that you can't. And I'll go further. You can't
[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:53.720]   even do it by watching a television or listening to a radio. Now, it'll be reported now that
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:57.720]   I say that no man's ever been converted by listening to a sermon on the wireless of a
[00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:03.360]   television. I'm not saying that, but I am saying this. I am saying that that is very
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:12.360]   exceptional, very exceptional. It does happen. But I am asserting that there is something
[00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:19.720]   about the gathering of the saints which is very vital to preaching. That is where the
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:26.120]   church is so important. We are in danger of becoming individualists. But you see, the
[00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:33.680]   church is the pillar and ground of the truth. And it is when the church is assembled together
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:41.480]   that the preaching is generally most effective. That is why I have often pleaded with people
[00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:46.000]   to realize the importance of attendance at the house of God. Let me put it like this
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   to you. Take the people, ninety percent of this population at the present time, who never
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:58.360]   darken the doors of a place of worship. Let's imagine a man, because he's in trouble, illness,
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:02.680]   or death in the family or something, he's disturbed. He's at the end of his tether,
[00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:07.160]   nobody can help him. He begins to think of God. Can God help? Can the church help? Very
[00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:14.520]   well, let's assume that he comes off the street into a church. Great building like this, if
[00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:20.960]   you like. What if he came in and found just a handful of people? I maintain that immediately
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:25.640]   he would be discouraged, he would be partly depressed. He'd say, "Well, evidently not
[00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:29.320]   many people believe in this. There was a time when they must have done, or they wouldn't
[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:32.600]   have put up a big building like that. But evidently Christians have come to see now
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:36.720]   there's nothing in it, and they don't use their own buildings. I say that already the
[00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:42.080]   devil is having a marvelous opportunity." On the other hand, if the men came in and
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:46.320]   found a building like this, packed with eager people, waiting on the preaching of the gospel,
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:52.400]   I say that he's carried by that a considerable distance in the direction of salvation. That's
[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:57.880]   not going to save him alone, but who can say that that isn't used and used of God? The
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:03.040]   church, the community of people. There is a spiritual atmosphere. People have come to
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:08.560]   me often and have told me that the first step in their salvation was coming into this building
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:14.440]   and feeling something that they didn't understand. Feeling that there was some atmosphere, some
[00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:19.720]   something that they'd never known before, and it made them attend unto the gospel, though
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:24.280]   at first they didn't understand it and didn't know what I was talking about. But they had
[00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:29.960]   felt and had sensed something which had held them and made them come back.
[00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:34.680]   Now then, this is, you see, where this whole question of preaching comes in. The congregation
[00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:42.160]   is used as well as the preacher. The whole testimony of the people, the whole atmosphere
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:49.360]   of people in whom the Holy Spirit resides. And then here is another argument for preaching
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:59.400]   as over and against reading. And that is the necessity, the vital necessity always, of
[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:06.560]   application. Now, I know that I'm saying things that sound dangerous. I stand in this
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:12.120]   pulpit and I advise you to buy books and to read them. And yet you know, reading can be
[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:19.760]   extremely dangerous. It can almost become a habit in the sense that one may become a
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:25.400]   drug addict. There's a very real danger with all these things. And I believe there is a
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:29.520]   danger in this respect at the present time. And this is one of the greatest dangers of
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:33.600]   all. If you are reading a book on your own, well, you can put it down whenever you like,
[00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:37.880]   and if it begins to disturb you, you put it down and you take up a newspaper or something
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:42.360]   else. But you know, there's this about being in a congregation. It's not always easy to
[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:47.320]   get out of the congregation. And you've got to stay there. And the power of the truth
[00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:51.240]   comes to you, mediated through the person of the preacher. And you feel you'd like
[00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:54.280]   to get up and go out, but you don't want to create a disturbance. And you've got to
[00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:59.600]   sit and listen. And it's applied to you. And that may be the very thing under the power
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:06.840]   of the Spirit that leads to your conversion and to your salvation. Application. It's
[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:11.440]   one thing to read. It's a very different thing to apply the message to yourself. We
[00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:20.520]   need application, we need exhortation to deliver us from a mere intellectual, theoretical,
[00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:25.440]   academic interest in the truth. And that is one of the greatest functions of the preacher.
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:30.280]   That is why men, of course, who read their sermons are denying the very essence of preaching.
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:35.680]   It is to be applied the whole time. That's the first task of the preacher. The truth
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:40.240]   is it does it where available to people, but he's got to bring it, he's got to have a sermon
[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:46.120]   with a shaft and a spear point, and it's got to penetrate, and that's the whole business
[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:51.400]   of preaching. And that is why I believe that God has ordained this as the regular, the
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:58.720]   customary method. Reading and other things are the exception in the economy of God.
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:04.640]   And you see, the facts confirm everything that I'm saying. The Bible, we are told,
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:10.160]   is the best seller in the world today. But look at the state of the world. The Bible
[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:15.440]   is the best seller in Great Britain. But look at Great Britain. What's the point of saying
[00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:20.400]   it is the best seller? There's something wrong somewhere. Yes, and what is wrong is that
[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:27.080]   people don't listen to preaching. The possession of a Bible, good though it is, is not enough.
[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:31.280]   It can be read as literature. People can pick out what they like, and they can leave out,
[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:37.080]   and they don't understand. The message of the Bible needs to be conveyed to them, presented
[00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:44.880]   to them, in a manner that is calculated to lead to their salvation. It is an interesting
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:53.440]   thing that in an age which reads more, perhaps, than any previous age in general, that the
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:31:01.920]   church has not flourished. If the reading of the Bible, and books, and tracts, and journals,
[00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:06.240]   and all the rest of it were really doing the work, our churches would be packed. But they
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:10.880]   are not. No, no, you go back across the history of the church, you will find that it is through
[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:17.920]   preaching that God produces his revival. He clothes a man, or a number of men, with
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:25.160]   power, and the truth is presented in this extraordinary manner.
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:29.560]   And finally, let me give you this argument for it, and I think this is a very important
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:39.120]   one also at the present time. The business of preaching, after all, is to explain the
[00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:47.120]   message of the Word. And I maintain that that can only be done by preaching. Now, today,
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:52.280]   you see, because people don't believe in preaching, they believe in new translations
[00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:58.480]   of the Bible. Had you ever thought that that was the main reason for all this excitement
[00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:03.840]   about new translations? It's because they don't believe in preaching. How do you work
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:07.640]   that out, says somebody? I work it out like this. Why, what's the argument for the new
[00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:13.680]   translations? Any one of them. Or the argument is this, they say people no longer understand
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:18.920]   the authorised version and the revised is very similar. And they say, we need, they
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:23.400]   don't understand these terms, justification, sanctification, and so on. We need now a new
[00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:29.800]   translation in which these terms will be put in a form that the modern men can understand.
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:35.080]   So they drop those terms, and propitiation and others, and they put it in terms of being
[00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:40.680]   delivered. They drop any idea of ransoming and things like that, and they use some very
[00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:48.760]   general terms about liberation and freedom and things like that. And they really believe
[00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:55.560]   that men and women now understand the truth. And there is one of the greatest dangers,
[00:32:55.560 --> 00:33:03.400]   as I see it, in the present religious situation. These great terms, like justification and
[00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:11.800]   sanctification, glorification and many others, propitiation and so on, I argue and maintain,
[00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:19.000]   cannot be presented simply by alternative translations. They are terms that have to
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:25.320]   be expounded. They are terms that have to be illustrated. What your modern translations
[00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:32.440]   are doing is to evacuate the terms of their real meaning. It is only the preacher who
[00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:39.400]   can really show the profound content of the terms. That is why preaching is absolutely
[00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:45.080]   essential. You can't get a single term to explain propitiation. You can't get a single
[00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:52.200]   term to explain justification nor sanctification. These terms must be worked out, they must
[00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:59.720]   be drawn out, they must be explained and expounded by the preacher. And alternative translations
[00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:05.720]   cannot do it. They are not doing so. They are indeed, ultimately, so many of them, standing
[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:12.120]   between the people and the real meaning of the terms. I support this argument, of course,
[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:19.400]   by again appealing to history. Men have never understood these terms. But even men and women
[00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:24.600]   two hundred years ago, before there was popular education, under the inspired preaching of
[00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:30.920]   people like Whitfield, the Westleys and the rest, were given an understanding through
[00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:37.240]   the preaching of the meaning of these great and glorious terms, and thereby, through them
[00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:43.480]   and by means of them, were led to a knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal
[00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:48.200]   saviour and redeemer. My friends, I sum it up like this. Preaching
[00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:54.760]   first. Preaching is God's ordained method. Here it is. How shall they hear without a
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:35:05.000]   preacher? This is the way still. Reading supplementary. A good supplement, an excellent supplement,
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:11.480]   but never a substitute. That's the position. It's when men substitute reading for preaching
[00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:19.560]   that disaster comes in. But reading as a substitute, as a supplement to the preaching, is of course
[00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:28.160]   excellent. And so it is that I advocate you are buying books that you may be well informed.
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:33.280]   That will supplement what I am trying feebly to say. And we thank God, therefore, for all
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:38.960]   literature that does in that way supplement the preaching. But God forbid that it should
[00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:46.480]   ever become a substitute for it. We must adhere to God's method. This is, the apostle says,
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:52.560]   the usual, customary, regular method of God throughout the ages. It always will be. He's
[00:35:52.560 --> 00:36:02.880]   not tied to it. He's not confined to it. The infant, the heathen, the poor man who's
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:12.360]   lost his reason, anybody, God can, exceptionally, as it were, miraculously, do the thing which
[00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:17.520]   he normally does in this, his chosen method and manner.
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:24.040]   Well now, there is the first great section then to which our attention is called in this
[00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:33.880]   important paragraph. It is by preaching that God has always done and still does and will
[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:39.320]   do this great work. How shall they hear without a preacher? Very well then, the second problem
[00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:49.840]   is the calling of the preacher. And that is dealt with here also by the apostle. It is
[00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:55.680]   through the preacher that one hears the message about the Lord. But then how does anyone ever
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:37:00.800]   become a preacher? That question is dealt with here.
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:11.880]   Now the word that is used here for preaching is a very interesting one. The study of this
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:19.840]   word preaching in the New Testament is full of fascination. You will find that a number
[00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:27.620]   of words, different words, are used in the original which are translated here as preaching.
[00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:34.960]   But there are two main words. The others are only used very occasionally. There are two
[00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:42.920]   which are used with considerable regularity. And it is to those two that I want to call
[00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:47.960]   your attention. Now, very fortunately for us, I can convey
[00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:54.160]   this matter to you very simply. In the eighth chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles,
[00:37:54.160 --> 00:38:03.680]   in verses four and five, the two words are used. Listen, let me read them to you.
[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:11.200]   We are told that there was a great persecution against the church in Jerusalem, and that
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:15.800]   as a result of it they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judea and
[00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:24.840]   Samaria except the apostles. Then I read in verse four, "Therefore they that were scattered
[00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:33.440]   abroad went everywhere preaching the word." Then in the next verse, verse five, "Then
[00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:40.000]   Philip went down to the city of Samaria and preached Christ unto them." You have got
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:46.800]   the word preached in verse four and five. Preaching the word in verse four, "Philip
[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:51.960]   went down to the city of Samaria and preached Christ unto them." But it is not the same
[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:59.120]   word in the original Greek. Now, these are the two words about which I
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:08.400]   am speaking. What is the difference? Well, the word that is used in the fourth verse
[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:18.160]   is a word out of which our word evangelize comes, and it means reporting the good news.
[00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:24.880]   It is a word which puts its emphasis upon the character of the message. The gospel good
[00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:33.840]   news, that is its main connotation and emphasis. Whereas the word that is used in the fifth
[00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:43.520]   verse has a different emphasis. It means a herald. The whole notion there is of a herald
[00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:49.280]   proclaiming a message. So that the main emphasis there is not so much upon the content of what
[00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:53.680]   he is proclaiming as upon the fact that he stands up, as it were, in a public place like
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:59.880]   a herald and makes a proclamation or an announcement. Now it is very interesting that next to one
[00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:07.640]   another there in that eighth chapter of Acts you have got these two statements, both translated
[00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:13.840]   here as preaching. But actually there was the difference. The people scattered abroad,
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:20.760]   they went everywhere, as somebody once translated it, gossiping the good news. But Philip, we
[00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:28.280]   are told, went down to the city of Samaria and heralded Christ unto them.
[00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:37.240]   Now in the twelfth verse of that same eighth chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostle,
[00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:43.280]   we read this, "But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom
[00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:47.600]   of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized both men and women." Now you
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:53.000]   see in verse five we are told that Philip was sent down to Samaria to herald the message.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:41:00.720]   Here they believed Philip reporting the good news. Here you see the author is anxious to
[00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:05.880]   show what it was that brought these people to believe, and why they did believe and why
[00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:12.880]   they were baptized. And the point was that they believed the good news. So the word "preaching"
[00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:19.200]   there is this word which conveys the notion of giving this good news, the message, rather
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:24.840]   than the way in which the message is being delivered.
[00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:29.040]   Now I don't want to make too much of this distinction, but it does seem to me that it
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:36.000]   is rather important, because the word that is used by the Apostle here in our tenth chapter
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:44.320]   of the epistle to the Romans is the second word, the word used about Philip in verse
[00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:50.440]   five. It is the herald, the proclaimer. How shall they hear without a herald, without
[00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:56.640]   a proclaimer, without someone who is sent to proclaim the message? That is the word
[00:41:56.640 --> 00:42:02.840]   that the Apostle uses in the section that we are studying in this tenth chapter of the
[00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:08.400]   epistle to the Romans. I don't want to make too much of it, but there is this vital distinction,
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:16.080]   and it is very interesting to notice the way in which these two words are used right away
[00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:17.880]   through the New Testament.
[00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:27.080]   So I want to suggest to you that we can draw this general conclusion, that every Christian
[00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:32.920]   should be able to give the good news, but that every Christian is not called upon to
[00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:39.160]   be a herald. Any man who is a Christian should know the way of salvation and should be able
[00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:43.720]   to tell another, should be able, as Peter puts it in 1 Peter in the third chapter, to
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:47.840]   give a reason for the hope that is in him. These ordinary members of the Church were
[00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:52.840]   able to tell people when they were scattered abroad by the persecution of the good news
[00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:57.080]   of Christ and him crucified and God's way of saving. They are able to do that. But you
[00:42:57.080 --> 00:43:02.840]   see when you come to an evangelist like Philip who is sent with a kind of official commission,
[00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:08.080]   you get the word "herald" used, the word which is used by the Apostle here in the tenth
[00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:17.520]   chapter. There is in connection with the preacher then this suggestion of an appointment, that
[00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:27.080]   he is called and appointed to make this great proclamation. And I am drawing a distinction
[00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:29.800]   between these two things.
[00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:34.680]   Well now my time has gone and I am afraid I will have to leave it at that for tonight.
[00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:42.080]   I will take up this point next Friday, God willing. But I want you to think about this.
[00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:48.680]   Why a different word was used there in the fifth verse of Acts 8 from the word that is
[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:59.560]   used in Acts 8.4? Think about that distinction and think of it all in terms of what the Apostle
[00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:06.760]   says here, "How shall they preach except they be sent?" Try and think out some of
[00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:14.880]   the applications of that distinction. Try and work that out especially in terms of the
[00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:21.840]   present state of the Christian Church. This is a great paragraph, it throws great light
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:27.920]   as I am trying to show you, upon our whole present situation, the confusion, the muddle,
[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:35.240]   the lack of discipline. Well now here then is one of these important points, the sending
[00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:42.280]   of the preacher. It is something that we should all consider, it applies to us all. We are
[00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:48.520]   all meant to be preachers in the sense of Acts 8.4. But what about the meaning of Acts
[00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:57.280]   8.5 and the application here and in other instances which, God willing, I shall put
[00:44:57.280 --> 00:45:03.120]   before you. Very well, we leave it at that and we will take it up once more next week.
[00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:04.120]   Let us pray.
[00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:13.040]   O Lord, our God, we again come to thee with thankful and grateful hearts. Lord, we see
[00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:22.240]   thy ways are perfect and we see how foolish we often are when we query thy methods. O
[00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:29.800]   God, we thank thee that they are what they are. We see that thou knowest us and knowest
[00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:37.560]   us better than we know ourselves. And so thou hast planned for us in a manner that is best
[00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:45.240]   for us. Lord, we humbly thank thee and praise thy great and holy name. Grant us thy blessing,
[00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:52.400]   O Lord, as we part now from one another. Give us wisdom, O Lord, in these confusing days
[00:45:52.400 --> 00:46:01.640]   in which we live. Give us wisdom, give us understanding, give us discretion. O Lord,
[00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:10.840]   give us a sense of our high responsibility just at this present time. Lead thou us on.
[00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:19.880]   And O God, hear us as we pray again that into the midst of all the confusion which man has
[00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:28.240]   made in the church as well as outside, that thou wouldst descend in the power of thy might.
[00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:36.560]   Hear us, O Lord, our God. And now may the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:42.040]   and the love of God and the fellowship and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and
[00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:48.840]   continue with us now and evermore. Amen.
[00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:52.920]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones. All of
