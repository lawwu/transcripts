[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640]   Why was there only one successful slave revolt in the New World?
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.840]   I guess you would have to say, you know, define successful.
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:13.520]   Haiti wasn't successful if you meant creating a prosperous state that would last for a long time.
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.720]   I mean, Haiti, to no small extent, because of the, you know, incredible blockade that
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.200]   was put on it by all the other nations, wasn't, is, you know, in terrible shape.
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:29.280]   There's a great, great Brazilian classic called Osho Toys by a guy named Acuna.
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.480]   It's an amazing translation, very good translation in English under rebellion in the backlands.
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:43.040]   And what it is about is in the 1880s, the creation of a hybrid state of, you know, runaway slaves
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:49.120]   and so forth, and how they had essentially kept their independence and lack of supervision
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.320]   informally from the time of colonialism.
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.160]   And now the new Brazilian state is trying to, you know, take control and they fight them,
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.000]   you know, to the last person.
