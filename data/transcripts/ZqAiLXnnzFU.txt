[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320]   So let's talk about psilocybin journeys
[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.000]   from the subjective side and from the structural side.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.680]   And when I say the structural side,
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.360]   what I mean is what does a psychedelic journey
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.520]   actually include?
[00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.160]   And here are the words set and setting
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.480]   become extremely important.
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.200]   Some of you may have heard that set and setting
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.520]   are the foundation of a well done
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.400]   or even therapeutically beneficial psychedelic journey.
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.560]   And all of that really hinges on safety and outcomes.
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.240]   So set refers to mindset,
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.760]   the mindset of the person taking the psychedelic.
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.520]   And setting refers to, as the name suggests,
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.880]   the setting in which they're taking it in
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.860]   and the people that are present there.
[00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.760]   So let's talk about setting first.
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.800]   The setting for a psychedelic journey
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.160]   needs to be one in which the person
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.760]   under the influence of the psilocybin
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.920]   or other psychedelic is safe.
[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.720]   That means no windows they can jump out of.
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.560]   That means no streets of moving cars they can run out into.
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.240]   That means no opportunity for getting lost.
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.420]   That means no opportunity for getting into bodies of water.
[00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.200]   In other words, it requires that there be at least one
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.080]   and perhaps even two or more other individuals
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.920]   who are not also taking psychedelics, right?
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.160]   Who are not also taking psychedelics
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.080]   present in that setting to ensure that the person
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.780]   taking the psilocybin is not going to harm themselves
[00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:21.840]   or others.
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.920]   I say this not to sound like a school teacher,
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.640]   even though technically I'm a school teacher,
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.480]   but because of course I don't want anyone to get harmed.
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.560]   And I'm also aware that there's a lot of interest nowadays
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.200]   in psychedelics such as psilocybin becoming legal
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.560]   or decriminalized for their therapeutic applications.
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.160]   And if we look back to the late 1960s and early 1970s,
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.700]   when the Controlled Substances Act was invoked
[00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.640]   to make psychedelics like psilocybin illegal,
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.600]   one of the bases for that
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.880]   was not just the geopolitical unrest at the time
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.200]   and things like the Vietnam War,
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.260]   but also some highlighted instances
[00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260]   in which people did not take set and setting
[00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.760]   into consideration,
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.040]   took things like LSD, stared at the sun, went blind,
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.880]   or took psilocybin, went out and harmed somebody else.
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.760]   Again, these are very, very isolated instances,
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.940]   but these are the exact sort of instances
[00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.160]   that lead to criminalization
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.700]   or the fact that things like psilocybin and LSD
[00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.480]   and MDMA for that matter are considered illegal.
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.160]   Again, I completely acknowledge
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.840]   that there are a number of different factors
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.700]   making them illegal.
[00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.160]   We could have a whole discussion about that.
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.220]   We talk about the drug trade, the war on drugs,
[00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.300]   but right now is such a critical time in the history
[00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.520]   and the use of psychedelics for therapeutic
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.960]   and other reasons.
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.480]   And getting setting correct,
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.080]   meaning making it absolutely as safe as possible
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.560]   for the person taking the psychedelic is absolutely key.
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.360]   And one of the best ways to ensure that it's safe
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.220]   is to have responsible individuals
[00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.160]   who are not under the influence of psychedelics
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.640]   present in that environment.
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.080]   So that's one component of setting.
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.480]   The other component of setting that we talked about earlier,
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.140]   which turns out to be very important,
[00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.680]   is the opportunity and perhaps even the bias
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.880]   toward the person on the psychedelic being seated
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.400]   or ideally lying down and being in the eye mask,
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.240]   or at least having their eyes covered
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.720]   so that they can combine
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.840]   any spontaneous visual hallucinations that occur
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.320]   with the various thought processes that are occurring
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.020]   while under the influence of psychedelics.
[00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.760]   This is far in a way different than quote unquote,
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.420]   taking mushrooms and going into the woods
[00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.680]   or taking mushrooms and going to the beach.
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.640]   What we're talking about today is the use of psychedelics
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.120]   for particular brain rewiring outcomes that yes,
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.980]   can involve things like changing one's relationship
[00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.100]   to nature or changing one's relationship to somebody else
[00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.040]   by interacting with nature or somebody else.
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.960]   And while I'm not trying to diminish the potential value
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.040]   of those sorts of psychedelic journeys,
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.860]   if we look at the scientific data,
[00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.680]   the vast majority of it, not just in the clinical setting,
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.560]   but in terms of understanding the safety and efficacy
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.520]   and positive rewiring of brain circuitry
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.020]   that allows people to feel better,
[00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.400]   to understand themselves better,
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.160]   and to interact with life in more adaptive ways
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.400]   going forward out of the psychedelic journey,
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.400]   involve these very, let's say, subdued settings
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.160]   that are typically in one room, a closed environment
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.320]   with one or two other individuals acting as sort of guides
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.880]   or helping the individual by talking to them
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.020]   from time to time if they feel like they have to sort
[00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.460]   through a particular aspect of the psychedelic journey
[00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:30.560]   that's creating anxiety.
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.640]   And we'll talk about the contour of the psychedelic journey
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.080]   that almost everyone who takes psilocybin
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.260]   at somewhere between 20 and 30 milligram dosages
[00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:39.600]   tends to experience.
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.040]   But the setting that I'm describing is not just a list
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.720]   of things to make sure you're safe,
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.480]   but they're really the list of things that also ensure
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.760]   that one can get the maximum benefit
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.720]   out of the psilocybin journey.
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.520]   Now, other things included in setting that are known,
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.520]   again, from scientific literature, to be very influential
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.520]   in terms of the experience that one has
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.920]   and to bias things towards a positive experience
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.920]   are, again, safety, eye mask,
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.540]   but also the presence of music.
[00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.040]   Now, when I first heard about this
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.280]   from one of the premier researchers on psilocybin
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.360]   and other psychedelics, which is Robin Cardart-Harris,
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.440]   he's a professor at University of California, San Francisco,
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.240]   who's one of the major pioneers
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.760]   in the studies of psychedelics.
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.820]   And when he first started telling me about the critical role
[00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.160]   that music plays, I thought, okay, that makes sense.
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:31.160]   Music can impact our emotion, impact the way that we think,
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.720]   and could therefore impact what one experiences
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.000]   during the psychedelic journey.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.480]   But he really underscored for me the extent
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.940]   to which music is not just a sort of incidental feature
[00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.060]   of the setting, in psychedelic setting,
[00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:50.520]   but that it is one of the major drivers
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.880]   of the actual cognitive and emotional experience
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.740]   that somebody has on something like psilocybin
[00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.560]   that allows the psilocybin journey to be looked at
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.880]   or viewed, not just as beneficial, but,
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.800]   and this is quoted in the scientific literature,
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.360]   as one of the most profound
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.840]   and important positive experiences
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.400]   that one ever experienced in their life.
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.780]   So let's talk about the sorts of music
[00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.920]   that have been used in these clinical studies.
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.440]   Well, first of all, we need to think about
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.840]   how long the psilocybin journey itself is going to be.
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.140]   And the typical duration of the psilocybin journey
[00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.640]   is anywhere from four to six hours.
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.640]   It's going to depend somewhat on dose.
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.020]   It's going to depend somewhat on variability
[00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.980]   in people's liver metabolism.
[00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:36.040]   And it's also going to depend somewhat
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.620]   on how much food people have in their gut.
[00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.440]   In all the clinical studies that I read,
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.800]   it was advised that people not have any food in their gut
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.700]   at the time at which they ingest
[00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:50.000]   or are injected with the psilocybin.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:50.840]   It's particularly true
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.000]   if people are going to be taking psilocybin mushrooms
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.520]   in order to get their psilocybin.
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.840]   And that has been done in a few studies.
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:57.680]   Most studies, however,
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.400]   use synthetic psilocybin taken orally.
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.640]   Again, that's converted to psilocin in the gut
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:03.920]   by the acidity of the gut.
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.280]   And the acidity of the gut is going to be impacted
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.640]   by the various foods that people eat.
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.460]   And so that's one of the major reasons
[00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:13.040]   why people are advised to not eat for at least four hours
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.160]   prior to the psilocybin journey.
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.460]   So here we've got this six-hour, what we're calling journey,
[00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:21.180]   'cause that's what everyone calls it, or trip,
[00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:26.000]   that people start experiencing about 30 to 45 minutes
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.780]   after ingesting psilocybin or taking psilocybin.
[00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:31.560]   There's a peak component
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.980]   in which there's a maximal intensity of emotion,
[00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:38.200]   and often that's also associated with anxiety.
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.360]   And this is very important to understand.
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.340]   The anxiety component is part of what,
[00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:44.380]   in the therapeutic setting,
[00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:46.600]   they refer to as ego dissolution.
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.360]   And that anxiety around the peak,
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.520]   and I think most people would probably hear peak experience
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:52.840]   and think, oh, we're talking about
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:55.240]   a peak positive experience.
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:08:00.240]   But no, we're referring to a peak experience in anxiety
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:05.400]   that people stay with and then come down from gradually
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:08.440]   as one goes from the second or third hour
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:09.920]   after taking psilocybin,
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:14.480]   and that tapers off slowly toward the six-hour mark,
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:18.320]   what sometimes people refer to as parachuting back in.
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:19.400]   Of course, they're not.
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.360]   Hopefully, I would very much hope
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.200]   people aren't actually parachuting back in
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.940]   while on psilocybin, but I think you get the idea.
[00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:30.940]   The music that's typically played in the clinical studies
[00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:33.420]   using psilocybin for the treatment of depression
[00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:36.180]   or for compulsive disorders or addiction
[00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:39.740]   tends to have a particular contour that matches with
[00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:44.320]   and can also drive that contour of the psilocybin journey
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.700]   that I just described.
[00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:48.780]   Again, we're talking about people wearing an eye mask
[00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:50.240]   with guides present,
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:53.600]   so people who are not taking psilocybin there as well
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.980]   to ensure that the person feels supported and is safe.
[00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:59.540]   The person is typically lying down,
[00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:00.360]   sometimes sitting down,
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:03.880]   but more often than not lying down, wearing an eye mask,
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:05.480]   and the music that's played
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:08.100]   at the beginning of the psilocybin session
[00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:11.680]   tends to be music that doesn't have a lot of vocalizations.
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:13.580]   It tends to be things like classical music.
[00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:15.660]   It tends to be fairly low volume,
[00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:18.860]   but that then transitions into music
[00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:23.580]   that has a lot of percussion, so often drums,
[00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:25.100]   that tends to be higher volume,
[00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:29.100]   that has a lot of intensity at about the time
[00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:32.780]   that one would be experiencing the peak in emotion
[00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:35.720]   and in perception, the so-called peak of the journey.
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:39.060]   That intense music tends to be played
[00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:42.440]   for about 45 minutes to 90 minutes,
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:44.580]   depending on the study one looks at,
[00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:49.400]   and then tends to transition into softer music again,
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:52.540]   sometimes choral type or more melodic music,
[00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:54.900]   often female voices in particular,
[00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:57.220]   and then transition into nature sounds
[00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:58.620]   and things that more or less mimic
[00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:03.340]   the outside natural world and less so synthetic things
[00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:05.720]   like drums or instruments and vocalizations
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:06.860]   and things of that sort.
[00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:10.020]   So why would it be so important that music match
[00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:12.820]   and even contribute to the subjective experience
[00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:14.260]   that people have on psychedelics?
[00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.660]   And here we should probably take a couple of moments
[00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:19.220]   and just talk about what those subjective experiences
[00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:20.060]   are like.
[00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:21.540]   So for people that haven't done psilocybin
[00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:25.160]   or any psychedelics, it's a little hard to describe,
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.940]   but one way to describe it is that there's a lot
[00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:29.760]   of so-called perceptual blending.
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:32.380]   So for instance, people in the eye mask
[00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:35.420]   will report seeing some geometric shapes and colors,
[00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:37.460]   but perhaps the music they're listening to
[00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:40.400]   will then start to change the intensity
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:43.380]   or the movement of whatever it is that they're seeing,
[00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:45.580]   hallucinating inside of the eye mask
[00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:46.740]   in ways that are linked.
[00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:48.820]   This is referred to as synesthesia
[00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:50.380]   or the merging of different senses
[00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:52.840]   that are not ordinarily merged.
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:55.480]   In addition, people under the influence of psilocybin
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:57.540]   or other psychedelics for that matter,
[00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:00.420]   often will report that their pattern of breathing
[00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:03.620]   becomes linked to the perceptions of things
[00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:06.140]   that they are hearing or seeing or feeling.
[00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:08.660]   So for instance, if they take a big deep breath in
[00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:10.180]   and then a long exhale out,
[00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:12.900]   they may find that during the long exhale out
[00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:14.940]   that the notes of music that they're hearing
[00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:17.800]   in those moments are also drawn out
[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.020]   for the duration of the breath,
[00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:20.820]   and they'll inhale and that they're getting
[00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:24.200]   at least what they perceive as control over the music,
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.140]   which of course they are not actually controlling
[00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:27.660]   by using their breath.
[00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:29.880]   And that perhaps their visual perceptions
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:31.480]   are also being merged with that.
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:33.240]   So those are just a couple of examples
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:36.500]   of how perceptual blending, aka synesthesia,
[00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:39.100]   can occur while under the influence of psilocybin.
[00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:41.420]   And this really is highly individual
[00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:42.840]   from one person to the next.
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.520]   Some people, for instance, will find
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:46.220]   that if they take their fingertips
[00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:49.100]   and rub them across the couch or the chair
[00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:51.300]   that they happen to be lying down or sitting on,
[00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:54.420]   that they will experience a change in the music.
[00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:56.580]   Maybe even if they move their hand up,
[00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:58.280]   they hear an increase in frequency of sound,
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:59.180]   they move their hand down,
[00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:00.740]   they hear a decrease in frequency of sound,
[00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:03.740]   and that all of this is linked to their emotional state
[00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:05.460]   at the same time and vice versa.
[00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:08.220]   Okay, so we're talking about a lot of perceptual
[00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:12.460]   and emotional blending and some sense of control
[00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:15.220]   over one's perceptions and emotions
[00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:19.980]   in a way that's very unordinary, even extraordinary.
[00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:22.140]   Now, we can step back from all of this
[00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:24.660]   very subjective description of the psychedelic journey
[00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:26.980]   and ask what is going on
[00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:29.500]   that would allow these sorts of things to occur?
[00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:30.980]   And there you are already equipped
[00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:33.360]   with an understanding of the cell biology and the chemistry
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.060]   that makes all of this possible.
[00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:38.700]   And that is that when psilocybin is ingested
[00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:40.260]   and then converted to psilocin,
[00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.820]   and it's the psilocin that crosses the blood-brain barrier,
[00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:45.940]   and then even though psilocin looks a lot like serotonin,
[00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:47.700]   psilocin has this incredible ability
[00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:51.580]   to predominantly activate the serotonin 2A receptor.
[00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:55.260]   Well, we can understand much of what's happening
[00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.900]   at a subjective level during the psychedelic journey,
[00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:59.780]   even right down to the sorts of emotions
[00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:02.100]   and perceptual blending, the synesthesia.
[00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:03.700]   We can understand a lot of that
[00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.780]   by understanding where the serotonin 2A receptors
[00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:08.780]   are expressed on neurons
[00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:11.420]   and what those particular neurons are doing.
[00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:12.900]   And the simplest way to describe this
[00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:15.180]   is that there's a category of neurons
[00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:16.540]   that we call pyramidal neurons.
[00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:19.160]   Pyramidal neurons are found lots of places in the brain,
[00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:20.340]   but they're called pyramidal neurons
[00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:22.240]   'cause they're shaped like a pyramid.
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:24.140]   They have a cell body, which is the part of the cell
[00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:25.740]   that has the DNA in it,
[00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:28.060]   and a lot of other important things
[00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:30.920]   like the organelles, mitochondria, et cetera.
[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:32.940]   And then they also have what are called dendrites.
[00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:36.100]   Dendrites are the little branches or processes
[00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:39.300]   that reach out both from the bottom of these cells,
[00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:42.460]   and then these pyramidal cells are interesting
[00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:45.740]   because they also grow a branch up, up, up, up, up, up
[00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:49.060]   into layers of neural tissue above them,
[00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:50.780]   and they have what's called an apical branch.
[00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:52.020]   That's the part that grows up,
[00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:53.980]   and then they fan out at the top.
[00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:55.380]   And that fanning out at the top
[00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:56.540]   allows them to communicate
[00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:58.340]   with other neurons in their environment.
[00:13:58.340 --> 00:13:59.780]   Okay, so if you're not getting a good picture
[00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:02.180]   of this in your mind for my description, I apologize,
[00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:06.620]   but simply think about putting your arms out to the side,
[00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:08.580]   and by doing that, you're able to interact
[00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:10.580]   with things that are some distance from your body,
[00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:13.160]   sort of an obvious thing in that case.
[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.300]   These cells are effectively doing the same thing
[00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:19.620]   by extending little processes out into layers above them
[00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:20.900]   and to the sides.
[00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:22.020]   And this is really important
[00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:24.660]   because much of the serotonin 2A receptors
[00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:26.380]   that are present on neurons in the brain
[00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:28.820]   are present in those apical dendrites,
[00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:31.580]   those branches of these pyramidal neurons
[00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:34.020]   that are above and that extend out
[00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:36.020]   to the side of those neurons.
[00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:39.500]   And so when somebody is under the influence of psilocybin,
[00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:43.700]   that means that psilocin has bound to the receptors
[00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:45.260]   on those apical dendrites,
[00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.980]   and it's increasing lateral communication
[00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:49.500]   across brain areas.
[00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:52.020]   In fact, this is perhaps one of the most
[00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:55.860]   well-documented effects of psilocybin and other psychedelics,
[00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:58.060]   which is that there's a shift
[00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:01.140]   from the brain being more modular, meaning more segmented,
[00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:03.860]   like auditory neurons are communicating electrically
[00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:07.100]   and chemically largely with other auditory neurons.
[00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:07.940]   Of course, they'll communicate
[00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:09.340]   with other types of neurons too, right?
[00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:10.860]   When I hear something off to my right,
[00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:12.700]   you know, like a snap of fingers off to the right,
[00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:15.540]   I'll turn my head and my ability to do that
[00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:17.580]   depends on my auditory neurons being linked up
[00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:20.300]   with things like my motor system and my visual system.
[00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:23.100]   But the key thing to understand is that
[00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:26.660]   when there is psilocybin present in one system,
[00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:31.780]   that the communication of any of these pyramidal neurons,
[00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:32.940]   the ones involved in hearing,
[00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:34.580]   the ones involved in thinking,
[00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:36.180]   the ones involved in memory,
[00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:38.980]   the ones involved in visual perception,
[00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:41.220]   or in the generation of visual hallucinations
[00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:42.620]   with eyes closed,
[00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:47.540]   those are all talking to many, many more other neurons
[00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:49.420]   more extensively.
[00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:51.240]   So what happens effectively
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:53.840]   is that there's a reduction in the modularity,
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:56.180]   the separateness of function in the brain,
[00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:59.760]   and an increase in what's called integration
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:01.840]   of communication across
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:04.600]   what would otherwise be disparate brain regions.
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.680]   We can say that really simply by saying
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:10.760]   psilocybin increases communication across the brain.
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:12.360]   Now, in addition to that,
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:13.920]   there's a reduction in what's called
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:16.320]   the hierarchical organization of the brain.
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.800]   Typically, sensory information comes in
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:19.960]   from the outside environment.
[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:21.540]   So we hear something, we see something,
[00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:23.760]   we taste something, we smell something.
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:26.700]   And in what's called a bottom-up fashion,
[00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:28.500]   meaning bottom from the periphery,
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:32.920]   up, meaning it propagates up through the eyes,
[00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:36.440]   through the nose, through the ears, through the skin,
[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:38.880]   or the senses in those regions, I should say,
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:43.540]   up into areas of the brain that sit deep to the cortex,
[00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:44.640]   like the thalamus.
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:48.280]   And then the thalamus is sort of a way station.
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:49.320]   It's like a switchboard
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.120]   that sends visual stuff to the visual centers,
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:52.840]   and auditory stuff to the auditory centers,
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:54.240]   and touch stuff to the touch centers,
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:57.280]   and things that maybe trigger a memory
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:00.040]   off to the memory centers of the brain, et cetera.
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:01.400]   That's the typical organization.
[00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:04.280]   It's hierarchical because it goes from the periphery up
[00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:06.720]   to the more complex processing regions of the brain
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:08.080]   that make decisions,
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:10.940]   that link all of that stuff to prior experience,
[00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:12.900]   maybe plans about the future.
[00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:16.160]   When psilocybin is present in the system,
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:19.720]   there's a broadening of the flow of that information
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:22.120]   from the bottom up as well.
[00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:24.520]   Okay, and that has to do with what's called thalamic gating.
[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:26.320]   The thalamus is a very interesting structure.
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:27.360]   We probably don't want to go into it
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:29.220]   in too much detail right now,
[00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:31.720]   but it really is like a switchboard and a way station
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:34.520]   saying, hey, pay attention to the visual stuff.
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:35.840]   Pay attention to the auditory stuff,
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:37.440]   or just to the visual and auditory stuff,
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:40.480]   and ignore touch sensation for the time being,
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:41.400]   or vice versa.
[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:44.840]   When psilocybin is present in the system,
[00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:46.960]   and when serotonin 2A receptors
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:48.940]   are activated very strongly,
[00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:51.380]   there's a tremendous broadening
[00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:54.300]   of the flow of information up and through the thalamus.
[00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:55.980]   So not only is there more communication
[00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:58.460]   of so-called higher order brain centers,
[00:17:58.460 --> 00:17:59.780]   we refer to them as higher order
[00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:01.700]   because they're involved in thinking and decision-making
[00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:03.020]   and emotion, et cetera,
[00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:07.020]   but there's also a shift in the flow of sensory information
[00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:11.460]   into the brain that can generally be described as broader
[00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:15.020]   and including more blending of the different senses.
[00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:16.540]   And when I say blending of the senses,
[00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:20.200]   I'm also referring to blending of the sense of interoception
[00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:21.960]   of our sense of our body
[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:23.900]   and what's happening inside of our body.
[00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:26.460]   And this, without question,
[00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:28.300]   at least partially explains
[00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:31.460]   why when under the influence of psilocybin,
[00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:33.740]   one's breathing can be linked to a sound,
[00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:36.900]   and then suddenly the sound, one thinks,
[00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:38.940]   is being controlled by one's breathing,
[00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:41.380]   or that the sound itself can be linked
[00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:43.800]   to something that we see in our mind's eye
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.240]   while in the eye mask.
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:46.620]   Essentially what I'm describing here
[00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:50.220]   is that serotonin 2A receptor activation
[00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:53.860]   allows for more broad, less precise,
[00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:57.100]   and less hierarchical activation of brain circuitry.
[00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:58.780]   And when I say hierarchical,
[00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:01.720]   what I mean is that normally things go from periphery,
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:04.540]   from eyes to thalamus to visual cortex.
[00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:07.500]   However, when under the influence of psilocybin,
[00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:09.860]   as I mentioned before, even in the eye mask,
[00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:11.940]   the visual cortex is going to be very activated
[00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:14.200]   even in the absence of any visual input.
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:19.020]   So then if one hears a sound, perhaps from music,
[00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:20.740]   a particular motif or voice,
[00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:23.100]   and that's linked to a particular emotional state,
[00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:26.540]   that is now being blended with visual phenomenon
[00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:29.620]   occurring within the brain that have no external stimulus.
[00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:32.700]   And so while the patterns of activation in the brain
[00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:35.520]   while under the influence of psilocybin aren't random,
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:38.740]   they are far less channeled, far less modular,
[00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:41.940]   and far less hierarchical than would ever be the case
[00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:44.800]   when not under the influence of psilocybin.
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:47.380]   [upbeat music]
[00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:49.960]   [upbeat music]
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:52.540]   (upbeat music)
