[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.500]   - Last time in episode 347,
[00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.280]   we talked about a theology of vacations.
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.820]   And speaking of family vacations,
[00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.740]   how can a dad lead his family well on vacation, Pastor John?
[00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.180]   Obviously, his leadership is never put on pause.
[00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.640]   There's something of labor for him in leading on vacations.
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.180]   So what is a dad's aim each day?
[00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.100]   What are the things for a dad to keep in mind
[00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.600]   to lead his family well?
[00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.460]   - Maybe the way I should respond
[00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.100]   is to say some of the things we did
[00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.980]   when our kids were little,
[00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.140]   rather than giving more biblical foundations
[00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.460]   for dad's responsibility.
[00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.460]   So yes, I'm assuming dad's leadership of the family
[00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.360]   and that it's never put on pause.
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.780]   But we gotta be careful here
[00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.780]   because even when I say it's not put on pause,
[00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.740]   I don't mean that he takes responsibility
[00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.260]   for all the decisions.
[00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.620]   That is, he doesn't make all the decisions.
[00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.100]   Good leadership never means that,
[00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.260]   never means you make all the decisions.
[00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.460]   Not in business, not in church, not in politics,
[00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.620]   not in family, leadership is initiative and planning.
[00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.340]   And inside that big picture,
[00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.000]   there are all kinds of delegation
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.940]   and sharings of decision-making.
[00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.500]   And a godly wife, I think,
[00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.140]   wants leadership, not micromanagement.
[00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.220]   She wants him to get off his duff and plan something
[00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.900]   rather than having to be drug here and there,
[00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.420]   always playing catch up with his wife.
[00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.020]   That wears her out.
[00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.020]   But she's happy to bear significant
[00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.640]   decision-making responsibility inside that big picture
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.620]   as she and her husband work all that out in detail.
[00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.620]   So when I say his leadership never goes on pause,
[00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.660]   I don't mean he's in charge at every minute.
[00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.340]   So here's some examples from the Piper family history.
[00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.220]   We had one son, three years later we had two sons,
[00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.380]   three years later we had three sons,
[00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.180]   and three years later we had four sons.
[00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.980]   Pretty good planning for college, right?
[00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.580]   So there were about eight years
[00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.860]   when we had four boys at home,
[00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.700]   and they can do the math to see how many we had
[00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.060]   for three and two and one.
[00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.580]   And we took vacations all of those summers
[00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.660]   with that many kids.
[00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.180]   And we never had a lot of money,
[00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.540]   so we never did big expensive vacations
[00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.620]   where we all get on a plane and go somewhere.
[00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.140]   I don't think, I can't ever remember us all
[00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.200]   getting on a plane and going somewhere.
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.200]   We borrowed cabins and we visited grandparents
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.500]   and we went with outings and so on.
[00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.800]   But so it was pretty simple.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.180]   I don't think we're outclassing most people here.
[00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.420]   What Noel wanted from me was that I would take
[00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.420]   the initiative to get things planned.
[00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.540]   Of course, she wanted to be in on the planning,
[00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.760]   but she didn't want to have to start it all,
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.880]   keep it all going, work it all out.
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.380]   She wanted me to say, she didn't want to have to come
[00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.820]   on May 31st and say,
[00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.460]   do you know our vacation starts tomorrow?
[00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.360]   Oh yeah, no, I did, I forgot.
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.480]   She did, that's terrible for a husband to act like that.
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.740]   He should be thinking ahead and planning.
[00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.800]   So I would start a conversation with her
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.560]   in the early spring and we'd work it out together.
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.200]   She also wanted time on vacation
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.640]   when she would have some free time from the kids
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.760]   and from cooking.
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.800]   Otherwise it's not a vacation.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.620]   I mean, sometimes guys think it's a vacation
[00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:47.460]   if you leave home.
[00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.160]   Well, no, not if you're a woman.
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.600]   I mean, and you care about, you know,
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.320]   caring for the kids and you got to cook.
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.200]   And if she has to do all the same stuff on vacation
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.600]   she did at home, it's no vacation for her.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.560]   And she knew that I wanted some time free also by myself.
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.060]   So very typically it worked like this.
[00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.800]   We'd go to some cabin or grandma's house or something.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.760]   And in the morning until lunch,
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.080]   I was free to do whatever I wanted.
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.620]   And Noel had the kids.
[00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.420]   So that's like four or five hours
[00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.420]   depending on when I got up, which usually meant I read.
[00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:28.640]   Hold myself up somewhere and read, took notes, wrote things.
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.560]   Then we ate lunch together and something really simple
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.500]   that either I could fix or get
[00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.980]   or didn't require any great preparations
[00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.580]   and super simple sandwich or something, fruit.
[00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.100]   And I took the boys all afternoon till supper time.
[00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.180]   So four or five hours for her.
[00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.420]   And then she could go off and do her crafts.
[00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:48.260]   She could go to town.
[00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:49.720]   She could do whatever she wanted.
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.140]   And she didn't have any responsibilities at all.
[00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.200]   And the guys and I, we'd play, we'd go to the lake.
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.900]   We'd ride bikes.
[00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.560]   I just thought of all kinds of different things
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.800]   that they could all do.
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:01.800]   And of course it's a challenge.
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:02.880]   They're all at different ages.
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.280]   And so you have to be creative and figure that out
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.780]   and put a little baby over on the side,
[00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.560]   hopefully enjoying the wiffle ball game a little bit.
[00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.380]   Then we ate together in the evening
[00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.580]   when we were all together doing something
[00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.620]   that everyone could more or less do depending on the ages.
[00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.160]   And then we read our Bibles, had a Bible story,
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.260]   maybe watch a little video of something
[00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.140]   that would be devotional.
[00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.980]   And then the guys would go to bed about 7.30 or 8.
[00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.620]   And I mean, of course as the teenagers got older,
[00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.180]   they didn't have schedules like that,
[00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.180]   but this is when they were younger.
[00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.340]   And Noelle and I had a couple hours just for us.
[00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.900]   So that's the way my leadership worked it out on vacation,
[00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.100]   which gave everybody some pause time,
[00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.420]   everybody some down time.
[00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.740]   And maybe I should say just one other thing,
[00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.540]   and I could have done better here.
[00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:58.200]   I think part of leadership on vacation
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.700]   should be some surprises.
[00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:05.380]   If dad doesn't plan, it probably won't happen.
[00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:08.020]   Something that they're not expecting
[00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.300]   and that he's planned and they'll remember.
[00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.420]   It doesn't have to be many and doesn't have to be expensive,
[00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:16.300]   but something that's just not his dragging his feet,
[00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.700]   but he's planned.
[00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:20.540]   So yes, leadership never goes on pause,
[00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:25.540]   but shared with his wife and everybody feels
[00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:27.780]   like they've had the kind of time
[00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:29.680]   that makes for real refreshment.
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.140]   - Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.760]   And family vacations can be spiritually refreshing
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.060]   just as they are physically refreshing.
[00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:38.940]   And interestingly enough, you Pastor John,
[00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.020]   were actually saved on a family vacation
[00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:42.460]   as a six year old.
[00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:43.300]   If you wanna hear that story,
[00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.500]   listen to Ask Pastor John episode number 158,
[00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.900]   John Piper's testimony, episode 158.
[00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.220]   Monday is Memorial Day,
[00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:52.900]   but we will be back to talk about adoption
[00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:54.300]   and especially one story
[00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.220]   of a wonderfully successful adoption
[00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:59.020]   that Pastor John has watched up close and personal,
[00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:00.740]   very close and personal.
[00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:02.180]   Until then, I'm your host, Tony Reineke.
[00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.120]   Have a wonderful, extended and restful weekend.
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.280]   We'll see you on Monday.
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.860]   (upbeat music)
[00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:11.440]   (upbeat music)
