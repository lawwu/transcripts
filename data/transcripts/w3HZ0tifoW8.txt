[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720]   Welcome back to the Ask Pastor John podcast. Tim, a podcast listener, writes in to ask this,
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.600]   "Pastor John, I always thought a complementarian view was the right view. But after seeing
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.320]   different churches go against this view, I ask, is there a biblical right or wrong view?"
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:23.120]   And then he says, "1 Timothy 2, 11-15, 1 Corinthians 14, 34-36, and 1 Corinthians 11, 2-16.
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:28.560]   More specifically, is God pleased with both a complementarian view and egalitarian view as long
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.600]   as we see Christ as our deepest joy and highest treasure? What advice do you have for people who
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.520]   have trouble answering this? In other words, is Christian hedonism only for complementarians?"
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:46.640]   Several things come to my mind to say when I hear that cluster of questions. And the first is
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:55.520]   that I'm sure many of our listeners don't know precisely what these two terms,
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.880]   complementarianism and egalitarianism, refer to. They're probably blurry. If they've heard of them
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:09.840]   at all, they've heard different things. So I don't like fuzziness. I don't like ambiguity. I don't
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.120]   want to talk about something that people don't know what he's talking about. So let's spend some
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.400]   time with definitions. Here's what I mean by complementarianism and egalitarianism.
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:28.080]   Complementarianism is a way of thinking and living that flows from the conviction that God
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.320]   created human beings as male and female, equal in worth, both in the image of God,
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:41.760]   both heirs of the grace of life, both fully capable of direct allegiance to the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:49.840]   and both fully redeemed from sin in Jesus, both destined for eternal joy and eternal
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:57.840]   significance as children of the creator of the universe, and that male and female are designed
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:06.720]   by God and appointed in his word for some distinct and complementary roles in life,
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.560]   owing to the fact that they are male and female. That's where the word complementarian comes from.
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:20.960]   God intends for the differences between men and women to find expression in complementary
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:28.080]   relationships as taught in scripture. For example, Ephesians 5.22, "Wives, submit to your own
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.480]   husbands as to the Lord, for the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:41.280]   the church, his body, and is himself its savior." Now, as the church submits to Christ, so wives
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.160]   should submit in everything to their husbands. Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:52.400]   church and gave himself for her. So complementarians read that, and we believe that God has designed
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:59.760]   husbands by virtue of being husbands, not wives, to be the head of the marriage and the home,
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:07.200]   and that this headship means at least bear the responsibility of a kind of leadership or
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.040]   initiative and bear a special sense of responsibility for protection and provision.
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:21.040]   And wives, with their God-given strength and wisdom, come alongside their husbands and support
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.000]   that leadership. That's what submission means. And help their husbands carry it through. That's
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   what help meet in the Genesis context means. Come alongside their husbands and help carry through
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   their leadership as part of the overall dynamic of the family. So complementarians believe that
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:46.880]   this way of relating is not rooted in competencies, their presence or their absence. You've got
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:56.960]   competencies or you don't. Irrelevant. But in the God-designed realities of manhood and womanhood.
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:07.120]   And complementarians believe that this God-given pattern glorifies Christ and his covenant-keeping
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:13.520]   relationship to his church, his bride, and that it leads to the greatest and longest joy.
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:22.240]   And complementarians believe that similarly in the church, God has designed for the men to be
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.280]   the overseers or elders or pastors with the responsibility of teaching and governing
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:33.680]   the local body of Christ as Christ led his disciples with servant-hearted initiative
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.720]   and vision and courage, which means as Christ-like examples to the flock.
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:45.600]   One of the main passages there that we look at is 1 Timothy 2, 11 to 14, "Let a woman learn
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:52.160]   quietly with all submissiveness. I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:58.080]   rather she is to remain quiet for Adam was formed first, then Eve, and Adam was not deceived,
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:04.560]   but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor." In other words, the two functions
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.560]   Paul assigns to elders as distinct from other kinds of leaders in the church,
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:17.920]   namely authority and teaching, he appoints to men. Authority governing and authoritative teaching in
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:25.920]   the church, and he roots this leadership in the order of creation and in the dynamics of the fall.
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:34.720]   Satan sidelined the man and drew the woman into the role of spokesman in the moment of crisis.
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:42.320]   He reversed the roles that God had intended. So in summary, complementarians see God's design
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:48.880]   for our good in the complementary roles for men and women for leadership and submission in the home
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:55.600]   and a similar structure in the church. There's more to say, but that's the summary. Here's my
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:02.960]   definition of how I understand egalitarianism. Egalitarians, on the other hand, believe that
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:11.120]   in Christ, those kinds of sex-based role distinctions are done away with, and that
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:17.520]   the relationship between a husband and a wife should not assume that the husband's manhood
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:26.880]   implies any unique leadership role or that a woman's womanhood implies any unique
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:34.480]   role of submission. Similarly, in the church, manhood and womanhood should not, male and female,
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:43.520]   should not be a decisive part of the criteria by which leadership roles are assigned. And key
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:49.600]   passages for them would be Galatians 3.28. There's neither Jew nor Greek. There's neither
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:58.640]   slave nor free. There's neither male nor female, for you're all one in Christ Jesus. Or Ephesians
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:07.680]   5.21, an emphasis on the mutuality, submitting to one another out of reverence for Christ and so on.
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:15.440]   So with those two definitions in my mind now, I'm in a position as a complementarian to answer the,
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:23.040]   what, I think I saw three questions that were asked. Number one, is there a biblical right
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:31.440]   or wrong view? Answer, yes, there is. Of course, things in real life are never quite as tidy
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:37.760]   as they are on paper, and many couples and churches probably get some things more or less
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:41.840]   right and some things more or less wrong in the application of complementarianism
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:49.600]   or egalitarianism. I'm sure my life has not been a perfect example of the biblical pattern,
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:56.720]   either at home or at church. But there is a view that is true and right, and it's not good to
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:02.960]   relativize this whole thing by saying there's not. Number two, is God pleased with both a
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:10.560]   complementarian view and egalitarian view as long as we see Christ as our deepest joy and highest
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:20.400]   treasure? No, God is never pleased with a shortfall in one part of his word just because we excel
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:28.800]   in another part. This is important for all of us to realize, all of us, because all of us do fall
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:36.800]   short in some parts of God's instruction while succeeding at other parts, and those successes
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:42.960]   never justify the failures. Let me give just an example from the scriptures of what I mean.
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:50.240]   Paul wrote to the Corinthians, and he began in chapter one with lavish praise. He said,
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:56.480]   verse four, "I give thanks to my God always for you because of the grace of God that's been
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:03.520]   given you in Christ Jesus, that in every way you are enriched in him in all speech and all knowledge,
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:09.920]   even as the testimony about Christ was confirmed among you." Wow, I would like to be such a
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:18.240]   beneficiary of that kind of praise. And in chapter 11, verse 17, he says, "But in the following
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:25.440]   instructions I do not commend you because when you come together it is not for the better but for the
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:35.840]   worse." So if we're walking out of step with God's word in one area of our lives and in step with
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:44.320]   God's word in another area of our lives, we should never content ourselves thinking that God is so
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:51.600]   pleased with our obedience that he will also be pleased with our disobedience. Question number
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:10:01.920]   three, last one I think, "Is Christian hedonism only for complementarians?" No. Of course a person
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:10.080]   who disagrees with me about complementarianism may agree with me about Christian hedonism.
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:19.440]   He won't flesh it out in all the same details of relational dynamics that I do, but the fundamental
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:29.280]   truths can be joyfully embraced. God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him.
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:36.640]   Therefore, let us always pursue satisfaction in him and take as many people with us as we can,
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:42.320]   even if it costs us our lives. That's my summary of Christian hedonism. In fact,
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:53.520]   I would say one final thing. Every time any of us embraces any aspect of biblical truth,
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:11:03.360]   it can have a salutary refining effect on the rest of what we believe. That is, it will sooner
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:13.280]   or later exert an influence toward truth in every area of our thinking and our living. That's the
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:23.600]   nature of the coherence of truth. At least that's the effect I hope it has on me. I hope that every
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:33.520]   refined or clarified or new truth that I embrace has the effect of correcting other areas of my
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:41.280]   life because of how truth is of a seamless fabric. So I would happily commend Christian hedonism
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:46.000]   to everyone, no matter what view of manhood and womanhood they hold.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.640]   >>Amen. Thank you, Pastor John. That is balanced and humbling for complementarians
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:56.640]   and egalitarians alike. None of us is above repentance. Well, thank you for listening.
