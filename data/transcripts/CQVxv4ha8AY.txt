[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.680]   Pastor John, occasionally I like to check in with you and simply ask if there's
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.640]   anything off of your front burner, anything that you're thinking about from
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.000]   your personal devotions that you want to share with us here.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.360]   Tony, I think what I want to do off my personal devotions is encourage folks to
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:39.640]   sing to the Lord by themselves in their personal devotions. I believe that the
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:47.520]   Spirit of God wants to encourage us to sing to the Son of God and to the Father.
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.280]   And the Spirit in which I'm giving this right now, maybe I better clarify, the
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.760]   Spirit in which I'm giving this encouragement to sing is like the
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.320]   marriage counseling I would be giving to somebody if they said, "Things aren't going
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.520]   so well with us. You don't need advice for us." I'm not laying anything
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:14.600]   down as a detailed prescription or a formula that's gonna fix anybody. I don't
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.580]   have any intention to say how often a person should sing or how long they
[00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.440]   should sing or how loud they should sing or any specific results that are gonna
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.880]   come from singing. It's not like that. It's more like me saying to a
[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:34.420]   husband, "Why don't you just try regularly saying to your wife, 'I love you'?" I'm not
[00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.240]   telling him five times a day. I'm just saying, if that's missing,
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.080]   probably it could go better. Or try touching her on the back of the
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.280]   neck when she's standing at the sink for no reason whatsoever, not leading
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.800]   anywhere, just felt like reaching out to her. Or try talking well of her in public.
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.200]   In other words, I would just be kind of throwing out these suggestions that I've
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.440]   learned over the years that would say, "I just think your marriage just might be
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.680]   enriched by doing those things." That's the Spirit in which I'm
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:12.640]   offering this encouragement to sing to the Lord in your personal devotions. And
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:19.560]   I say this as one who's not a natural singer alone. I love to sing in church. I
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.320]   love to sing with lots of people carrying my voice so I don't have to
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:30.880]   hear me. I don't default to singing when I'm alone. I wish I did. I wish I
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.680]   were that kind of person. I hear some people, they just sing. They're just
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.200]   singing. John Bloom is like that. He just seems to be singing. I don't do that. I
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.560]   have to say, "Oh, it would be good to sing. Let's sing." So I'm kind of
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.040]   preaching to myself here. And the more I've thought about that, like why I'm not
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:54.840]   like that, the less I like it. I don't like it. I don't like having to be told
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:01.480]   to sing. I wish I were the kind of person who just sang. So anyway, I'm not, and I'm
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:09.800]   talking to me and anybody like me. It seems to me that the psalmists sang and
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.520]   encouraged us to sing, not just in the great congregation. They did all the time.
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.600]   Sing in the great congregation. But I think when they got up in the morning,
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:25.920]   here's Psalm 57, "I will sing and make melody. Awake, my glory. Awake, O harp and
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.560]   lyre. I will awake the dawn." So he's like, wakes up in the morning, "I'm gonna sing
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.920]   the sun up." Or Psalm 108, same thing, "My heart is steadfast, O God. I will sing
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.440]   and make melody with all my being. Awake, awake, O harp and lyre. I will awake the
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.640]   dawn." That seems to be like, I haven't gone to church. I haven't gone to the temple
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:55.040]   or to the synagogue. I'm just bringing up the sun with my song. Or Psalm 59,
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:01.640]   "I will sing of your strength. I will sing aloud of your steadfast love in the
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:07.480]   morning, for you have been to me a fortress." He just seems to be overwhelmed
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.280]   by God's strength in his life, and he wants to wake up the morning with it.
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:18.320]   It's the overflow of joy. "My heart shall rejoice in your salvation. I will
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.960]   sing to the Lord because he has dealt bountifully with me." So has the Lord
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.120]   dealt bountifully with you? Well, the response of the psalmist was, "I will sing
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.520]   to the Lord." That would be maybe a good response to add to whatever your
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:38.240]   responses are to the bounty of the Lord. And he seemed to sing to the Lord when
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:44.560]   he woke up at night. Psalm 63, "When I remember you upon my bed and meditate on
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.520]   you in the watches of the night, for you have been my help and in the shadow of
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:57.440]   your wings I will sing for joy." So he's not just singing at church. It seems to
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.600]   be something that he just considered part of his being. He said, "I will sing to the
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:08.040]   Lord as long as I live. I will sing praise to my God while I have my being."
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:14.440]   He just belonged to his being. And Paul, I mean, if you leave the Psalms
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.440]   behind and go over to Paul, here's an amazing thing he said in 1 Corinthians
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:25.120]   14, "What am I to do? I will pray with my spirit and I will pray with my mind also.
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:31.640]   I will sing praise with my spirit and I will sing with my mind also." He's talking
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:38.800]   about tongues there, and sometimes he's in the spirits singing in tongues and
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:44.120]   sometimes he's not. And so it seems like part of Paul's personal devotions was he
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:52.680]   sang by himself. And James said this, "Is anyone among you suffering?" James 5, "Let
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:59.120]   him pray." Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing praise. So that probably didn't mean
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:04.320]   wait till you get to church. So I'm not gonna make any great promises to anybody.
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:10.720]   I'm just gonna say, "God would be pleased no matter how bad your voice is and you
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:16.520]   will be helped, yes you will, good things will happen in your soul if you sing to
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.760]   the Lord. So get a hymnal or go to Google and print out your favorite worship
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:29.960]   songs or sing softly so nobody can hear or sing loud." I'll close with this. Noel
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:35.680]   and I had an apartment in England about seven years ago on our sabbatical. The
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:41.400]   most memorable thing of living in that apartment is the Korean couple in the
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:46.780]   morning who lived above us and we awakened to them singing, the two of them
[00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:52.200]   singing every morning. It was one of the sweetest sounds that I've ever heard. And
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:56.760]   so whether people hear you or don't doesn't doesn't matter, it will be
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:02.320]   powerful in your life. Good, yeah. And just for clarity's sake, are you making any
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:06.600]   fundamental distinction between singing in daily morning devotions at home and
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:11.160]   say singing alone in the car on your way to work? No, no I'm not making those
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:17.000]   distinctions. That's just awesome. I grew up in a home with a mom and
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:24.200]   dad who sang in the front seat with my sister and me in the back seat and to
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:29.880]   this day I look at that and say, "What a privilege, what a privilege." I wonder if
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:35.360]   I'm still a Christian because of looking at my mom and dad and saying, "They're not
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:39.960]   performing. They're not in front of a church. They're not even thinking about us.
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:45.000]   They are singing their old-fashioned spiritual songs because they're
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:52.440]   overflowing together." So car, you know, walking out in the woods, wherever, I'm
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:58.240]   just saying personal singing, not just corporate singing, is a sweet experience
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:02.960]   that I wish everybody could taste. Wonderful. Thank You, Pastor John. Well, but
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:06.440]   what if you don't feel like you connect with God at all in singing to Him? This
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:10.080]   was a question raised online not long ago and Pastor John addressed it in
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:14.680]   episode number 287 titled "Giving Up on the Church." It can be found in the Ask
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:19.640]   Pastor John podcast archive, most easily in the free iPhone app. Thank you for
