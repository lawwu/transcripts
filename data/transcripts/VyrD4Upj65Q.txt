[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   (music)
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.440]   A podcast listener named James writes in, "Pastor John, a big question for parents is whether talking about past sins,
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.520]   sins like drug use, sexual immorality, drunkenness, etc.,
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.460]   will make our children more or less likely to try out or do these things when they're older.
[00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:26.340]   It seems like they might reason like this, 'Well, you turned out alright,' and proceed with entering into the behavior.
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.960]   Pastor John, what category should parents think through when it comes to communicating past sins with our children now?"
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.160]   Let me establish a crucial
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.480]   parenting principle and practice, which I think is dictated by the Gospel,
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.000]   before I
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.080]   tackle the direct question. And I've got six questions for parents that I think
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.360]   they should ask, kind of diagnostic questions as to whether at this time to this child,
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.440]   this particular sin should be talked about. But before I go there,
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.280]   let's lay down a principle. The principle is
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:11.120]   that far more important than the confession of past sins is
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.880]   the regular confession of present sins. And
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.960]   the practice, therefore, is that we model,
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.840]   for our children, in family devotions or other times, a
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.080]   regular pattern, a rhythm of
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:36.640]   confession to show our children how a follower of Jesus
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.960]   handles sin in his own life. So a pattern of confession,
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.480]   forgiveness, restoration to fellowship—
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.080]   nothing will have a greater Gospel impact on a child,
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.240]   I think, than to see daddy—that they tend to think are infallible, since they deliver the law.
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.320]   Daddy's infallible. Daddy's
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.880]   flawless. And to hear daddy
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.800]   regularly confessing to mom, confessing to kids, but especially confessing to God,
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.000]   sins, applying the blood of Jesus and
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.600]   experiencing restored joy of fellowship with God will show the child, "Oh, I
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:25.520]   don't have to be perfect. There is a way to handle sin." Children are born legalists, and they are born
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.800]   licentious, and those are not
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:35.040]   contradictory. They believe that the only path to morality is keeping the law—
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:41.760]   parents' law, school law, babysitter law, traffic law, whatever, law, law, law. Everywhere's law because these kids are just being told what to do.
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.640]   All the time, from the time they're, you know, nine months old on up. And they don't like those
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.120]   limitations of law on their desires, and so they
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:59.200]   gravitate towards strategies of getting around the law and somehow squirming away or through the law. And the
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:06.640]   alternative to this is the Gospel of the glory of Christ, seeing parents who love
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.120]   Christ so much that Christ looks appealing to them,
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.520]   not mainly as a lawgiver, but a soul satisfier, a friend, a guide, a
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:22.840]   helper, a counselor, and yes, a final absolute authority,
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.640]   which is good news, not bad news, if all those other things are true.
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.420]   Seeing parents who admit they don't love him perfectly all the time,
[00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.400]   but sometimes act as though he's not their greatest treasure,
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:43.720]   that's crucial for a child. Parents who regularly admit to the children, to the spouse, that
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.160]   they don't model
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.360]   Christ and his value perfectly all the time, and so they confess their sins,
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.520]   they're honest about their sins, not hiding their sins, they're modeling for their children.
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.960]   You don't have to lie about your sins. You don't have to hide your sins.
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:06.320]   You can be honest about them, and Christ will forgive, and we will forgive, and we can press on with
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.960]   fresh joy.
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:14.080]   So that's the principle. That's the practice, and I think it might lift some of the burden of,
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.720]   "Well, don't I have to, you know, be honest with my children about these past sins of mine?"
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:25.240]   And the children will never even enter their mind that you're being dishonest with them, if you set this pattern.
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:31.680]   But they did ask, "Okay, so there are these real sins in our pasts.
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.520]   What should we do with them in regard to our children?" And here are my six more or less, I suppose,
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:43.120]   diagnostic questions to ask. Number one, how old is the child?
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.760]   Capacities to grasp what you're talking about vary with age.
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:54.640]   You will not confess to your five-year-old that once, when you were 12, you dabbled in
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.360]   homosexual pornography. You won't say that to your five-year-old child.
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.720]   He doesn't even have the categories to know what that is yet.
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:08.800]   You might confess this to a 15-year-old whose sexual identity is confused,
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.000]   and he's come to you kind of scared and
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.840]   wondering about some feelings that he has, and you might then go back and pick up some of your own struggles and help.
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:22.200]   So the question there is, how old is he? Number two, how spiritually mature is the child?
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:27.640]   If you're dealing with a hateful and rebellious 16-year-old
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:34.440]   who would only hang your dirty laundry on Facebook as soon as you say it because he's so down on you,
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.200]   then you might want to wait until there's a more tender, mature
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:47.200]   season in that kid's life to reveal some things. The third question is, what's the nature of the sin?
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:54.920]   Some sin may be of such a nature that if a child heard it, it would frighten them, confuse them,
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:00.760]   give them a kind of insecurity that just wouldn't be good for them. For example, there might have been in your life a
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:08.080]   sexual sin against a minor when you were babysitting at age 17 or something like that, and you didn't go to
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:16.240]   jail, but that would be the kind of thing that would require the greatest care in sharing, if you ever
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:22.400]   shared it, because of the kind of disorientation it might create in the child's mind. Number four,
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:29.720]   what are the circumstances right now as the possibility of divulging a sin presents itself?
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.960]   I'm thinking mainly about privacy here.
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:39.520]   My guess is that there are some sins that would have a far better effect on a young person if you shared it
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:44.960]   with the person if they were alone with mom or dad when the sin was shared.
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:51.840]   Probably not at Pizza Hut, but taking a walk by the river and not with the brothers and sisters around because kids can feel
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.200]   really awkward around brothers or sisters or another parent when dealing with something heavy and
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:06.040]   awkward, and they might have questions that they'd be willing to ask mom or dad if they were alone in a safe place.
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:13.560]   So the circumstances. Number five, is your spouse okay with your sharing the sin? Get on the same page
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:20.800]   so that you don't cross wires here in dealing with the kids. It needs to have a unified
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.480]   sense or impact as you go forward. Number six,
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.400]   what is the child struggling with?
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:35.720]   One great motive in sharing past sins will be to help the child have realistic expectations about the Christian life.
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.520]   A child that's struggling, say, with lying
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:45.080]   may be helped by parents' confession of lying, perhaps to illustrate
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:52.760]   forgiveness or perhaps illustrate the trouble that it got him into as a kid, one way or the other, just kind of warning or
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:57.400]   comfort, or perhaps to illustrate how God helped the parent stop lying.
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:04.480]   So what is the child dealing with at any given time that might trigger which kinds of things you might call up from your
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:09.800]   past? And the last one I would say is, what's your motive for telling the sin?
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:15.520]   What's your motive for silence about the sin? Because frankly, I don't think you need to say
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:20.680]   everything to your child about your past. There's no rule
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:26.680]   I'm aware of that says every sin from the past must be known by children in the present.
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:31.920]   In deciding what is shared and what is not,
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:36.880]   the motive really matters, and the manner by which you do it that we've been talking about
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:44.120]   matters. Fear and shame are not good motives for silence,
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:48.800]   but concern for children and modeling humility and
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:53.120]   illustration of the gospel and glorification of Christ are
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:56.040]   motives that are good.
[00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:02.400]   But I want to end by just going back and saying what I did at the beginning that far more crucial,
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:06.320]   I think, than discerning which, if any, of your
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:12.560]   significant, heavy, weighty sins of the past are shared in the present is that
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.200]   pattern of
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.200]   ongoing confession and
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:24.960]   making it a regular feature of family life so that kids learn what the Christian life is by the
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.320]   present, not just the past.
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:31.200]   Those are very helpful categories to think through on this issue. Thank you, Pastor John.
