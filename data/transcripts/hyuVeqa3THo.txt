[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.460]   In our circles, Pastor John, we hear a lot about idols. So what is an idol? What is
[00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.980]   idolatry? Why is idolatry dangerous? And what does an idol look like in today's
[00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.780]   world? Maybe the best way to get at this, instead of trying to reach out to the
[00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:27.040]   whole Bible and pull all the pieces together, which is not a bad thing to do,
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.520]   here, let's just go to one verse, one passage of Scripture, because I think in
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.480]   this verse, namely Colossians 3, 5, and 6, the answer to all three questions are
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:45.360]   there. What's an idol? Why is it dangerous? What do they look like today? So here's
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:52.080]   the verse, Colossians 3, "Put to death what is earthly in you, sexual immorality,
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:01:00.200]   impurity, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry. On account of these,
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:11.440]   the wrath of God is coming." So, answer to the question, "Why are idols dangerous?" is
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:20.840]   because the wrath of God is coming upon idolatry. Nothing is more dangerous than
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:28.400]   the wrath of an omnipotent, all-righteous God. And Paul says, "The wrath of God is
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:35.480]   coming on idolatry." Now, why would that be? Exodus 20, listen to this, "You shall
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.840]   not make for yourself a carved image or any likeness or anything that is in
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.040]   heaven above or that is in the earth beneath or that is under the earth. You
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:51.840]   shall not bow down to them or serve them, for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:59.640]   God." The wrath of God comes on the idolater because God is jealous. There is
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.960]   a righteous and holy jealousy and an unrighteous and weak and insecure
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:14.200]   jealousy. And God's jealousy is not only righteous, that is, he deserves our
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.000]   deepest and strongest affections and admiration, but he's loving. It's a loving
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.280]   jealousy because we were made to find our greatest joy when he is our greatest
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.960]   treasure. He's jealous that he be honored by being treasured, and he's
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:38.320]   jealous that we be satisfied by treasuring him. So, he is jealous in a
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:45.200]   loving way, and he's jealous in a righteous way. And if we find God to be
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:54.240]   so boring or so negligible that we must put other things in his place that
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:01.080]   really satisfy us more than he does, then we not only offend him, but we also
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:09.040]   destroy ourselves. And those two things make God angry. He doesn't want to be
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:15.160]   offended, and he doesn't want us to destroy ourselves. And idolatry
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.880]   contradicts both of those things, and so his wrath comes upon the idolater. So,
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.640]   that's the answer to the first question, why it is so dangerous. And the
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.480]   other two questions can be taken together, I think, something like this,
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:37.480]   "What is an idol, and what does it look like today?" Paul says, "Covetousness, which
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:45.480]   is idolatry." So, what idolatry looks like today is the activity of the human heart.
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:52.800]   This is not a deed of the body that follows like fruit on a branch. It starts
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:04:00.160]   in the heart, craving, wanting, enjoying, being satisfied by anything that you
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:08.280]   treasure more than God. That's an idol. Paul calls this covetousness, a disordered
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:17.320]   love or desire, loving more than God what ought to be loved less than God, and
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:24.040]   only for the sake of God. But covetousness is the condition that this
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:32.120]   disordered heart is into, an act of loving too much what ought to be loved
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:38.360]   less, and that's why the wrath of God is coming. That's what idolatry looks like
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:44.880]   today, and it's everywhere in our culture. So, finally, what is an idol?
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:51.880]   Well, it's the thing. It's the thing loved, or the person loved more than God,
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:59.040]   wanted more than God, desired more than God, treasured more than God, enjoyed more
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:06.440]   than God. Could be your girlfriend, could be good grades, could be the approval of
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.160]   other people, it could be success in business, could be sexual stimulation,
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:18.400]   could be a hobby or a musical group that you're following, or a sport, or your
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:25.760]   immaculate yard. I was looking for some yard stuff the other day, and I
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:32.560]   clicked on a video ad for a yard service, and three people came on, and all of
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.960]   them made the point that this yard service enabled them to brag that they
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:43.240]   had the best yard in the neighborhood. What a motivation! I want to be number
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:49.200]   one in green grass. So that could be an idol, or your own looks could be an idol,
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:55.780]   could be anything. So Paul puts it like this in Romans 125, "They exchanged the
[00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:03.320]   truth about God for a lie, and worshipped and served the creature." Anything that's
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:10.240]   created, rather than the Creator. But there's no wrath for the
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:17.040]   children of God. And why is that? Because Paul said in 1 Thessalonians 1, "You turn
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:22.760]   to God from idols to serve the living and true God, and to wait for his Son
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:29.440]   from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, Jesus, who delivers us from the wrath to
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:36.000]   come." So when we turn to Christ from idols, we escape the wrath of God, because
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:42.960]   he's for us, God is for us in Christ on the cross. Yes, amen. Thank you, Pastor
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:47.320]   John. So does Christian hedonism, this thing we're all about, a desiring God,
[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:51.040]   this idea that God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him,
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:55.720]   does this lead us to make an idol out of joy? It was the question raised and
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:59.240]   answered by Pastor John in episode number 120, be sure to check that out in

[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:39.120]   career path to choose? Tomorrow, Pastor John will explain the single most
