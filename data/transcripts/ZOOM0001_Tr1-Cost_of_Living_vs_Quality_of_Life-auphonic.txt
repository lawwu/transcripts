[00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:55.920]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge, skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. Today on the show, we're going to talk about the cost of living versus quality of life with an international flair. I received today's show topic when I was recently trolling about on Twitter asking listeners what they would like to hear me talk about. And one listener said, "I'm not sure if I would like to hear you talk about the cost of living, but I'm sure I would like to hear you talk about the cost of living." So I'm going to talk about that today.

[00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.700]   We all have different things that are appropriate in our life stage. And so we're going to have, even if we consider the same factors, we're going to weigh factors a little bit differently. So as I go through these ideas, I'm going to talk about them.
[00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.700]   I'm going to talk about them.

[00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:47.820]   You should recognize that you have to do this no matter where you live and that your appreciation of different factors will probably change at different times.
[00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.720]   For example, having a small house versus a large house.
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.460]   How much you value and how you can use them.

Your career options are much more limited in Vanuatu than they are in New York City. So now your cost of living, then you have to count in your opportunity cost.

So if you're looking to live in a little bit of the downtown environment, you like the nightlife, you like the cultural activities, etc., but you don't have to live in, you know, downtown Hong Kong. You can save money by not living in downtown Hong Kong, but just by simply living in another city that still has that urban environment, but as you can see, it's a very small city.

Perhaps you enjoy living in downtown Prague, and that gives you what you're looking for without having the astronomical costs of downtown Hong Kong, or downtown Singapore, etc. So the cost of housing can change based upon location. But a lot of times when people talk about saving money on housing, they're often looking to save money on housing by going to a country where things are perceived to be cheaper.

[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:28.720]   Transportation is a free app for all. You can use it to access your own medical care. If you're a low-income earner, then sometimes moving to a place that has government-run health insurance programs, etc., can allow you to access medical care without so much money coming out of pocket. And because you're a low-income earner, all of the high-income earners that do pay taxes in that place are subsidizing your individual situation. I recently spoke with a retiree who had moved outside of the United States, and we were talking about their budget, and I was trying to get it. They'd moved from Wisconsin to a low-cost, low-income place.

[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   a lot of it is just due to competition.
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:59.020]   I think the United States has a much cheaper cost of living than again,
[00:31:59.020 --> 00:31:59.020]   almost any place that I have been.
[00:31:59.020 --> 00:31:59.020]   Now when you move to restaurants and restaurant food, that is where you can have a dramatic difference in cost. Restaurant prices in the United States are modest. They're not nearly as high as many regions of the world, but they're much much higher than some of the well-known cheaper regions of the world. There are places in the world where it just makes more sense for many people to go out to eat for most of their meals instead of cooking themselves. That is what I'm saying.
[00:31:59.020 --> 00:31:59.040]   It's just a matter of how many people are able to eat for most of their meals instead of cooking themselves. That is how many people are able to eat for most of their meals instead of cooking themselves. That is what I'm saying.
[00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:29.060]   It is the case in even in some expensive places, Hong Kong or Asia, many parts of Asia. And that partly then goes back to the cost of labor. Cost of labor, high in the United States. Cost of labor, low in some corners of Asia. And so you can, if you want to eat out a lot, you can gain substantially by going to an inexpensive corner of the world where you can get a great meal for a few dollars, whether that's a taco stand in Mexico or a noodle shop in the United States.
