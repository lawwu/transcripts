[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.200]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.960]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.960]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. Today in the show, we're going
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:51.040]   to talk about the cost of living versus quality of life with an international flair. I received
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.080]   today's show topic when I was recently trolling about on Twitter asking listeners what they
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.860]   would like to hear me talk about, and one listener wrote to me and said, basically,
[00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.560]   talk about the cost of living versus the quality of life in an international context. And I
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:11.200]   thought this a useful and interesting topic, partly because it is something that I am living,
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.200]   am in the middle of considering and working my way through in different things, but it's
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.680]   something that I've also thought a lot about, and I think it has application even outside
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.640]   of an international context. Because in many ways, these factors, comparing the cost of
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.120]   living versus the quality of life, these are factors that we all have to consider in our
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:40.360]   own unique context. Even if you're considering, should I live in downtown Atlanta or in the
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.600]   suburbs? Well, you're going to talk about the cost of living versus the quality of life.
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.080]   Should I live in Kansas or should I live in California? You're going to talk about the
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.920]   cost of living versus the quality of life. And these factors are sometimes difficult
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:01.640]   to talk about because they're very subjective. Both of these are very subjective. Obviously,
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.360]   the quality of life is more subjective than cost of living because we can put dollars
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.480]   and cents to the costs, but even the costs are subjective because we all value different
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:14.300]   things. We all spend money on different things. We all have different things that are appropriate
[00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.440]   in our life stage. And so we're going to have, even if we consider the same factors, we're
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.120]   going to weigh factors a little bit differently. So as I go through these ideas, I'm going
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.880]   to talk to you about them in a fairly general way and give you my thoughts on the international
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:36.800]   context versus primarily where I have the most experience, a US-American context. You
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:43.840]   should recognize that you have to do this no matter where you live and that your appreciation
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:50.120]   of different factors will probably change at different times. For example, having a
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:57.360]   small house versus a large house. How much you value a small house versus a large house
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:03.520]   will probably change depending on what life stage you're in. For me, my opinion, if I
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:09.280]   were a single man living alone, I would value having a small house. I would not want to
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.680]   have a big house because the big house adds work, more work to keep up with, more work
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.280]   to clean, more work to furnish. It adds more hassle to my life. It adds more things I have
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.720]   to care for. It adds more costs, more square feet that I have to heat, that I have to cool,
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.640]   et cetera. And so as a single man, I would value having a smaller house more than I would
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.040]   have value having a larger house. And it's not just about the cost. It's not just that
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.000]   I can save money. Yes, that could help me. But frankly, I think if you gave me a house
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.160]   twice as big and a house half as big and they were the same cost and I liked them equally,
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.080]   I would probably choose the smaller one because it would free up my time more than the other,
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.640]   especially if I didn't have a use for it. I weren't entertaining or having big parties,
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.080]   things like that. What's the point of having three bedrooms that sit empty all the time
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.880]   if I can't use them? Now, on the flip side, at the stage of life that I'm at right now
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:07.040]   where I have children and they need places to be and we do all kinds of things from our
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.720]   house, I work from my house, we do school at our house, my children play in our house,
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.560]   we entertain in our house, et cetera. I'm at a phase of life right now where having
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:23.800]   a smaller house or a very small house would really be a burden and it would really substantially
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:30.800]   reduce the quality of life. Ask me how I know? Well, I lived in an RV last year for six months.
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.920]   And the great thing about the RV was that we could constantly move the location, but
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.440]   it certainly convinced me that although it might look nice on a TV show or might look
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.360]   nice on a YouTube video, living in a small RV with many young children is not great for
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.880]   the long term. So I'm at a phase of life where a bigger house is more valuable. The point
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.040]   is these things will change as time goes on. I expect that there will be a point in time
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.720]   where I'll go back to valuing a smaller house. Now, what about where that house is located?
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.760]   There is a time in most of our lives, especially when we're young, that we really want to be
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.120]   in the middle of the action. Most young people, especially if they're single, want to be in
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.520]   the middle of the city. And so there, a small apartment in the middle of a city has a very
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:19.480]   high quality of life appeal for many people. Whereas you get a little bit older, you have
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:23.160]   children and all of a sudden now you don't really feel like going out and partying on
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.840]   Thursday night and you'd rather be where it's quieter, you'd rather be where you have some
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:32.360]   space. These are natural cycles that people go through. You choose what you like, but
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:39.120]   they change over time. If you have to choose between cost of living and quality of life,
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:45.840]   I think your optimal choice should prioritize quality of life because you can always adjust
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:52.480]   for costs. As we talk about the costs here in a moment, and I go through all of the different
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:57.200]   categories that I think people think about or should think about when they're considering
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.880]   an international relocation, what you'll see is that it's really a mixed bag. There are
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.640]   different costs that are high at different times of life. So you might pay more to live
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.960]   in the middle of the city. But if you like being in the middle of the city, perhaps there
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:18.360]   are so many interesting events available, free events, cultural things, shows, expeditions,
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.200]   all kinds of things available for you just at your fingertips that you make up what you
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:27.640]   spend in rent payments with savings on entertainment. Whereas if you lived out in the country, you're
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.920]   always driving into town, etc. Now if you like being in the country, your entertainment
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:37.760]   might be hanging out in the woods and that's much cheaper for you than buying $12 martinis
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:43.620]   and buying tickets to the latest greatest show, etc. So if you prioritize the things
[00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:48.200]   that are important to you, your quality of life, you can figure out how to adjust the
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:53.960]   costs in almost any budget to fit what you were looking for at a certain phase of your
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:07:02.120]   life. The point here of my introduction is you will have to make these assessments in
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:06.940]   your life even if you're going to live in the place where you were born and raised.
[00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:12.280]   You make these assessments in terms of city versus suburbs versus country. You make these
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:16.720]   assessments in terms of which part of the state do you live in, which side of the highway
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:21.400]   do you live on, which side of the river do you live in, what elevation do you choose
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:26.800]   to live at, which state do you live in. These are all things that we face and we have to
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:30.640]   consider them from a personal perspective. Now from here on out, I'm going to focus on
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:35.600]   the international bent because I think that is something that many people do consider.
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:42.260]   Let's talk first about the costs. Actually, let's start with the costs. I think that
[00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:50.800]   living internationally in many ways is a mixed bag of costs. I think one of the oversold
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:58.000]   concepts in personal finance is if you want to save money, you should move to a country
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:05.800]   that is cheap. I think that can work in some cases, but it probably won't work in most
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:14.320]   cases because although you might reduce costs in one area, you'll often raise them in another.
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:18.760]   So let's talk through some different factors of costs and I'll try to tackle these in order
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:24.280]   of biggest cost to littlest as far as for the most of us, for our average budgets. The
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:31.900]   first biggest expense that most of us have is tax, most importantly income tax and by
[00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:39.240]   extent employment tax. That is for most of us the single biggest category of our expenditures.
[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:44.900]   It may not be for you if you don't earn very much money, but if you earn anything above
[00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:50.800]   the median income, which in the United States is something like $60,000 per year, in that
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:56.400]   range anything north of $60,000 a year and that is by far the majority of the radical
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:01.080]   personal finance listening audiences and far in excess of six figures, very often multi
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:08.320]   six figures, your single biggest cost is tax, income tax. The way that you can know if this
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:13.160]   is true for you or not is to actually calculate the number. I did this with a consulting client
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:19.040]   recently, husband, wife, both well employed professional workers, each earning a six figure
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:24.400]   salary and I had them sit down and calculate their cost of tax. And the way you do it,
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:29.320]   pull out your federal income tax return for the most recent calendar year, pull out your
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:35.160]   state income tax return for the most recent calendar year and calculate your employment
[00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:40.660]   taxes, which you can perhaps find on your W-2 or you can just simply calculate them.
[00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:45.720]   If you are an employee, you will be 7.65% up to the social security wage base. That
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:50.560]   is your contribution to the employment taxes in the United States or 15.3% up to the social
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:58.080]   security wage base, which is ish $120,000 ish. So if you calculate that on your income,
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:02.720]   you'll know what your total cost of tax is. If you live in a city that imposes city
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:07.440]   income taxes, do that as well. But if you total those three together, federal income
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:11.960]   taxes, state income taxes, employment taxes, and I guess if you pay city taxes, which is
[00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:16.280]   not common, if you pay city income taxes, calculate that as well. If you total those
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:21.600]   together, then you'll know your total cost of tax. And it is my bet that that number
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:25.080]   for you, as long as you're earning above the median income, that number for you will
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:31.600]   be the single largest category expense in your household budget. Don't forget about
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:35.280]   your Medicare surcharge tax, etc. on higher numbers, but let's just stick with those
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:47.480]   simple ones. Can you affect taxes by moving abroad? Absolutely. In my opinion, that, taxes,
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:55.600]   is one of the biggest potential savings of moving abroad. If you are moving to a tax-efficient
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:02.160]   location, if you're moving from being a full-time resident of the United States to being a full-time
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:07.280]   resident of France, you're not going to save on taxes. If you're moving from Great Britain
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:13.660]   to Canada, you're not going to save on taxes. But if you are moving in a tax-optimized way,
[00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:17.760]   to a tax haven, or if you are structuring your life in a way that you move to a place
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:25.180]   that's very tax-efficient for you, you can save dramatic amounts of money by moving thoughtfully
[00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:31.020]   and carefully. And that can be a huge, huge benefit, especially a benefit at different
[00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:37.800]   points of your life. Now, where is this more important? Here's where there's a big difference
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:43.760]   between talking to a Brit versus talking to a US American. For an American, the biggest
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:51.560]   savings on taxes by moving abroad is on income taxes, on your earned income. So if you're
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:56.540]   in a period of time where you're going to have high earned income, you can make dramatic
[00:11:56.540 --> 00:12:02.640]   improvements in your life and your lifestyle and your cost of living by moving thoughtfully.
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:05.440]   Whereas if you're in a phase where you're earning a lot of investment income, it's a
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:10.120]   little bit more difficult. Now, if you're going to be experiencing large capital gains
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:14.360]   in your life, you can adjust for that. There are different ways that you can do it. And
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:19.800]   we've talked about that in various internationalization shows. My point is that moving internationally,
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:25.200]   moving abroad, can make a major difference in your costs of living. Now, how does your
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:29.520]   cost of living affect your quality of life? Depends on what's important to you. Give you
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:33.320]   an example. Let's say that you want to work in the financial space and you want to be
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:38.920]   a banker and you're considering taking a job working as a banker in New York City or you're
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:43.560]   taking considering taking a job working as a banker in London or you're considering taking
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:51.840]   a job working as a banker in Dubai. How is your cost of living going to change in those
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:57.640]   scenarios? Well, in many ways, New York City and London are very similar. You're going
[00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:03.920]   to have a very high cost of housing. You're going to have high built-in costs for food,
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:08.680]   etc., because of living in the city. And you're going to have very high costs of taxation.
[00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:12.840]   Now, you could probably live in London a little bit more efficiently than in New York City,
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:16.040]   depending on how you're structuring things. But in both cases, you're going to pay a lot
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:20.520]   of income tax, especially if you're having earned income as a banker. New York City,
[00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:26.840]   US federal income taxes, New York State and New York City income taxes. London, same thing.
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:32.280]   Dubai, no income taxes. No income taxes, too. Dubai doesn't tax income. So if you're going
[00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:37.200]   to earn a salary of three, four, five hundred thousand dollars per year, and you can structure
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:41.080]   things so that you either pay income taxes on three, four, five hundred thousand dollars
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:45.160]   a year, or you don't pay income taxes on three or four or five hundred thousand dollars per
[00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:52.640]   year, there's major benefits for you in choosing Dubai over New York City or London. What about
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:56.680]   quality of life? Is your quality of life substantially different in any of those locations?
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:01.200]   They all, you can get along great with English. They're all bustling modern cities. You can
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:07.400]   make an argument that Dubai is nicer, more modern than some of the others. You have certainly
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:14.600]   interesting cultural mixes, all of them very cosmopolitan, cultural melting pots of cultures.
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:18.240]   Your lifestyle in all of them is going to be substantially similar. You're going to
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:23.280]   go to big city parties. You're going to have, it's going to be about the same quality of
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:27.840]   life is the point. You're probably going to send your children to private schools in any
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:32.240]   of those contexts, especially if you're a banker. In one case, choosing an international
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:36.640]   school versus just a Tony local private school that doesn't bill itself as an international
[00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:40.040]   school. But in many ways, just about everything in your life will look the same. The weather
[00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:44.360]   might be a little bit different, that is clear, but you're a banker. You're spending most
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:50.360]   of your time indoors anyway. So how does that impact you? So you can have the same virtually,
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:55.160]   the same quality of life with a much lower cost of living by living and choosing to live
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:15:01.440]   in Dubai instead of choosing to live in New York City, unless it affects something else.
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:06.860]   For example, let's say that all of your family is on Long Island and that's where all your
[00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:12.980]   heritage is. Well, it's a little more difficult for you now to justify living in Dubai when
[00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:17.280]   it's an expensive international airplane ticket for you to get to Long Island instead of just
[00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:25.600]   a little time driving out. So that's where other things have to come into account. But
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:29.840]   I think taxes are probably one of the major things, especially this audience does need
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:36.460]   to consider. If you live and work in a tax haven, you can do very well and you can achieve
[00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:42.400]   your goals much more quickly than if you live and work in a place that imposes high levels
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:49.540]   of taxation. That assumes, of course, that you can be as well employed living and working
[00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:55.900]   in the tax haven as you can living and working elsewhere. For example, you could live and
[00:15:55.900 --> 00:16:00.140]   work in New York City and do very well because there are massive career options available
[00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:07.120]   for you. You could live and work in Vanuatu. Your career options are much more limited
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:12.960]   in Vanuatu than they are in New York City. So now your cost of living, then you have
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:16.660]   to count in your opportunity cost. If you live in the tax haven but you don't have career
[00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:21.040]   options available for you, it might not work out so well. Next biggest expense category
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:27.800]   is usually for most people, housing. In my opinion, the cost of housing can really be
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:36.740]   a mixed bag in terms of how it compares internationally. The biggest cost of housing will largely be
[00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:44.000]   based upon are you living in an urban context or a non-urban context. It costs more to live
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:50.520]   in the city center than it does to live outside of the city center. It also costs more to
[00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:56.780]   be in a major city center than it does to be in a minor city center. So if you're looking
[00:16:56.780 --> 00:17:02.120]   to live in a little bit of the downtown environment, you like the nightlife, you like the cultural
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:08.560]   activities, etc. But you don't have to live in downtown Hong Kong. You can save money
[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:15.800]   by not living in downtown Hong Kong but just by simply living in another city that still
[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:21.240]   has that urban environment but is not quite so expensive. Perhaps you enjoy living in
[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:25.600]   downtown Prague and that gives you what you're looking for without having the astronomical
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:31.240]   costs of downtown Hong Kong or downtown Singapore, etc. So the cost of housing can change based
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:36.000]   upon location. But a lot of times when people talk about saving money on housing, they're
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:43.200]   often looking to save money on housing by going to a country where things are perceived
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:48.600]   to be cheaper. Again, it is true that things are cheaper in some big cities than others.
[00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:53.440]   But a lot of times I think the savings on housing are often oversold. In my opinion,
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:58.000]   a lot of times the biggest difference in the cost of housing comes to the quality of the
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.600]   housing. For example, in the United States, there are certain things that are considered
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:07.320]   standard that almost every house or apartment, including the cheapest of the houses and apartments,
[00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:12.220]   will have. Things like hot water in the house. The whole house will be plumbed for hot water.
[00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:16.800]   Or perhaps central heating or central air conditioning. Those things are more and more
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:21.280]   considered to be standard in the United States. But if you go to a place where housing is
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:25.760]   cheaper, you'll find that they're usually not standard. Your hot water might be limited
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:30.840]   to a shower head. Your shower might have an electric hot water heater in it that heats
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:35.280]   the water for your shower, but your whole house doesn't have hot water. And central
[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:40.200]   heating, central cooling, etc. is not standard. Rather, if you have any air conditioning at
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:44.600]   all, you have just a small window unit in your bedroom. Things like that. Those account
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:50.800]   for a large portion of the savings. I think that yes, you can save money on housing. You
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:56.160]   can save money on rent by going abroad. And you might like that. But a lot of times the
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:01.160]   savings on housing come to accepting lower standards of housing. And if you are willing
[00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:05.960]   to accept lower standards of housing, you could live equally inexpensively in the United
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:12.680]   States than going abroad, for example. Very few of us choose to live in pre-manufactured
[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:18.960]   housing or a mobile home or an RV, etc. But in many ways, you could argue that a nice
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:25.480]   single wide modern trailer living in is more comfortable and is better built than a beachside
[00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:30.240]   shack in Belize. The beachside shack in Belize might be inexpensive, but at the end of the
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:35.280]   day, it's kind of a hovel. Whereas you can have a modern single wide trailer for a few
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:40.400]   hundred dollars a month on your loan payment or you can rent one for a few hundred dollars
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:45.960]   a month and have just as comfortable of housing. It doesn't have the same romance. It's a lot
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:49.760]   easier for you to say, "Okay, well, I'm willing to lower my standards because I'm living in
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:54.680]   Belize." It's very hard for somebody to be willing to move from the big city in the United
[00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:59.200]   States and downsize and downgrade their lifestyle in the United States because their friends
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:03.280]   all see that, etc. They can move to the beachside shack in Belize and say, "Look, I'm living
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:08.020]   in Belize. This is what's available." And that might be one consideration. But housing,
[00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:12.840]   you don't necessarily have to move abroad to save money on housing. You can move to
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:18.120]   Mississippi. You can move to a trailer. And you can save a lot of money on housing in
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:21.680]   these contexts. It might not provide you with what you want. For example, if you want to
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:26.160]   be on the Caribbean, Belize might be what you're looking for. But it might be cheaper
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:32.360]   than Fort Myers. But it is available in the United States. It's just most people don't
[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:38.560]   see it. So yes, can you save money on housing? Probably. But it's probably because of a downgrade
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:45.880]   of basic standards than necessarily a major difference in the location. Obviously, there
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:51.940]   can be exceptions to that. Obviously, places do sell for cheaper in some places than another.
[00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:55.240]   What I would recommend to you if you're interested in kind of getting a sense of the cost of
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:21:01.240]   different places, in my opinion, Airbnb is the single best tool for you to get a sense
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:07.000]   of what different locations actually cost. What I like to do if I'm trying to figure
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.640]   out the cost of one place versus another is I like to use Airbnb. And I like to look for
[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:18.760]   monthly rentals. Because when you rent, you can, of course, find local rentals in a newspaper.
[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:23.280]   You can find local real estate things, et cetera. But those are hard to find. And they're
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:27.680]   a little bit inefficient. But if you use the Airbnb website, and you look for a monthly
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:33.220]   rental, and you search different locations, you'll find things that are ready to go. You'll
[00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:36.760]   find things that you can actually rent right there. A couple of clicks, put in your credit
[00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:41.000]   card, bada bing, bada bam. Why am I saying that ridiculous cliche, bada bing, bada bam,
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:48.280]   bada boom? I don't know why that came out of my mouth. You can click, and you can reserve
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:52.600]   something right there, right now. Whereas searching through real estate listings, you
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:57.320]   don't know what the true cost is of the utilities. You don't know what the true cost is of the
[00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:02.760]   taxes or what your deposit is, et cetera. Airbnb is really good.
[00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:10.920]   And what you'll see when you do that is, yes, there is a distinction of different places.
[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:16.000]   Renting a three-bedroom apartment in downtown Asuncion is a lot cheaper than renting a
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:26.120]   three-bedroom apartment in downtown Miami. It is. But you can find three-bedrooms places
[00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:31.600]   in Florida, and just go up into North Florida or Central Florida. You can find places that
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:37.820]   are not that much more than downtown Asuncion. So hopefully that helps you to get the point
[00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:42.200]   of what I'm saying is, yes, they are out there, and you can save money on housing. So if you
[00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:47.320]   want to live the downtown lifestyle, consider it, and use Airbnb as your best, truest representation
[00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:53.240]   of what market rates actually are. Super competitive marketplace, really good to help you understand
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:55.200]   the costs of housing.
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:23:01.640]   Next big category for some people is insurance. And usually this is health insurance. And
[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:05.600]   so I'm going to pair together insurance or health care. The insurance can include health
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:09.560]   insurance, can include car insurance, other kinds of insurance, but a lot of times it's
[00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:13.500]   health insurance. Now here's where there's going to be a big difference for you based
[00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:20.680]   upon the place that you choose to be and what your income level is. If your income is low
[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:25.200]   and you can buy inexpensive health insurance, whether it's subsidized in the United States
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:29.440]   or whether it's some kind of government run system in another country, then you can save
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:32.420]   a lot of money on insurance by moving somewhere else.
[00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:40.360]   So if you want to live in a place where insurance and health care is provided by the government
[00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:45.160]   instead of paying it for yourself, you can do that and you can save money there. It probably
[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:49.280]   won't work out for you well if your income is high. If your income is high, you're probably
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:54.320]   better off just simply paying for it out of pocket. But here's where I do think people
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:58.800]   who consider moving outside of the United States can sometimes get a better deal. If
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:03.960]   you're a low income earner, then sometimes moving to a place that has government run
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:10.080]   health insurance programs, etc., can allow you to access medical care without so much
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:14.840]   money coming out of pocket. And because you're a low income earner, all of the high income
[00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:19.920]   earners that do pay taxes in that place are subsidizing your individual situation.
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:23.360]   I recently spoke with a retiree who had moved outside of the United States and we were talking
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:28.640]   about their budget and I was trying to get it. They'd moved from Wisconsin to a low cost
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:32.840]   place. And I was talking with them outside of the United States. I was talking about
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:38.800]   what they missed, what they liked, etc. And basically this came out as their number one
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:42.960]   cost savings. It was their number one thing, was health care. And in their case, they were
[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:47.840]   using doctors and then they were also looking forward to benefiting from things like long
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:49.200]   term care providers.
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:53.920]   I've seen a number of interesting new resorts and retirement communities that have been
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:57.920]   opening up throughout Asia. And one of the big selling points is they're basically like
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:03.360]   a continuing care retirement community in the United States, but just in an Asian context.
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:07.780]   And when you get into the world of long term care or continuing care retirement community,
[00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:12.940]   one of your biggest expenses is labor costs. And one place where you can save massive amounts
[00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:17.760]   of money is if you're dealing with something that involves labor costs by moving outside
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:23.400]   the United States. So you can buy a membership in Thailand and in a continuing care retirement
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:27.760]   community basically in Thailand, all inclusive resort, everything's there. But they promise
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:32.600]   24 hour nursing care as you age and if you need health care. And it is far, far cheaper
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:37.400]   than buying the same thing in the United States because the labor costs are much, much lower.
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:42.480]   Labor costs in the United States, of course, being extremely high. So for certain people,
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:47.800]   the cost savings on insurance and health care can be really substantial. But you may not
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:52.580]   necessarily benefit from those if you're not in a phase of life where you need much insurance
[00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:57.820]   or need much medical care. And so you would have to judge accordingly. You should also
[00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:02.240]   remember, of course, that you can access some of the lower cost health care regard without
[00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:07.480]   actually moving to a place just by engaging in medical tourism. I think medical tourism
[00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:11.040]   is going to be one of the great growth industries of the future. People just simply choosing
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:15.680]   to go to another place to have their medical procedures done. So whether you're going to
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:21.440]   Costa Rica to have dental care done or whether you're going to Brazil to have plastic surgery
[00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:26.240]   or whether you're going to Mexico to have cancer treatment or whatever it is, you can
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:32.000]   save massive amounts of money by engaging in medical tourism. What about transportation?
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:37.280]   Well transportation could be a mixed bag. First, you can move to many countries outside
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:41.780]   of the United States where transportation is cheaper. But of course, you can move to
[00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:46.840]   places where it's more expensive. I know that doesn't help you, but for me just to say that.
[00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:52.640]   But bus tickets, many places have just better built out transportation options where you
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:58.080]   can get by on the public transportation system. And by working on the public transportation
[00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:04.440]   system, you can eliminate the need for owning a car in and of itself. You can't do that
[00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:10.920]   in many cities in the United States. You know, Hot Springs, Arkansas is a nice place, but
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:15.480]   the public transportation system is not as efficient as the public transportation system
[00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:21.800]   in Bogota. So judge for yourself. Do you save and lower your cost of living by moving to
[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:28.560]   a place where there is a lower cost of transportation by having a local infrastructure of public
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:32.440]   transportation? That might be something to consider. If you're talking about transportation
[00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:36.520]   in terms of private transportation, I really don't think there's any place in the world
[00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:42.320]   that's cheaper to own an automobile than in the United States. And that's where I think
[00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:47.360]   there's a major benefit for the United States. If you want to buy a car, own a car, operate
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:52.920]   a car, I haven't done any research, but I've never personally been to a place where it's
[00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:57.720]   cheaper than doing it in the United States. And there are a few reasons for this. So first,
[00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:04.560]   it's easy to buy cheap quality automobiles in the United States. Because there's so many
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:09.280]   people with high incomes who are constantly purchasing new automobiles, the used automobile
[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:14.880]   marketplace in the United States is stronger and better than the used automobile marketplace
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:20.280]   in any place that I've ever been. You can find awesome vehicles, three years old, four
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:25.600]   years old, 10 years old, all day long, every day at every single dealership. They're great
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:31.160]   cars, they've cut in half, they've dropped a third or 50% off of their new car price,
[00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:34.600]   and they're available and they'll serve you for a decade or more. And they're cheap to
[00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:39.320]   buy. Because the new market is so competitive, and because there's so many cars, it creates
[00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:43.640]   this really robust used market. That doesn't exist in many corners of the world. In many
[00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:48.240]   corners of the world, the new market is not nearly so strong, and thus the used market
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:52.280]   is not nearly so strong. And so you can't apply all of the same analysis that you would
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:56.960]   apply in the United States to, should I buy a new or used car, to your situation in many
[00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:02.240]   other places. So cars are cheap to buy in the United States. Cars are cheap to run in
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:09.240]   the United States. Gas prices are very low compared to many places in the world. They're
[00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:12.720]   not as low as they could be, but they're very low compared to many places in the world.
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:17.400]   Not everywhere, but many places in the world. In addition to that, all the other costs,
[00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:21.800]   costs of insurance, relatively low. Now that'll vary a lot depending on where you live. For
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:27.240]   example, cost of car insurance in downtown Miami, brutally high. Cost of car insurance
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:31.280]   in Orlando, way, way lower. So you consider things like that when you're trying to choose
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:36.280]   between Miami and Orlando. Cost of registering a vehicle. In the United States, there are
[00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:40.480]   extremely low taxes generally. Yes, you have to deal with some sales tax with your local
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:46.440]   state, but you can dramatically reduce your sales tax by buying a cheaper car and/or living
[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:50.480]   in a state that doesn't impose sales tax, but buying a cheaper car. And then the cost
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:54.440]   of registering it, getting your license plate, things like that, very, very cheap. Cost of
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:58.680]   owning a car, cost of tires, cost of oil, all that stuff in the United States is cheap,
[00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:04.920]   cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap compared to most places in the world. So if your ideal living
[00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:08.440]   involves a lot of transportation or a lot of transportation costs, you're not going
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:13.400]   to save money on that. So if you want to go and be able to live on the bus and ride the
[00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:19.720]   bus and take the tuk-tuk and travel around with whatever's available and you don't mind
[00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:24.960]   riding a tap-tap instead of actually having your own vehicle, then fine. But if it's important
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:28.160]   to you to drive your own vehicle and that's a big deal for you, you're going to pay a
[00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:31.920]   lot more in almost every place I've been than the United States.
[00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:37.320]   What about food? Food is an interesting mix because everywhere in the world you can find
[00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:44.000]   and buy basic staples relatively inexpensively. I don't see how a country can stay out of
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:50.160]   political and civil unrest if food prices are not modest. And so for basic staples,
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:54.360]   I mean the cost of rice, the cost of wheat, the cost of basic vegetables, those things
[00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:59.120]   are basically low all over the world. When you start to get into packaged goods, in my
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:03.040]   experience packaged goods are a lot cheaper in the United States than almost anywhere
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:11.080]   else. Part of that is due to lower taxations, no VAT tax, modest sales taxes, and part of
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:14.360]   it is just due to competition with things like packaged foods. The United States lives
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:19.920]   on packaged foods. And so you can buy all of that packaged stuff much more cheaply in
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:26.000]   the United States than almost anywhere else in the world. So you can eat inexpensively
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.880]   on food prices if you're cooking your own anywhere in the world. But when it comes to
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:33.480]   packaged foods, I think the United States has a much cheaper cost of living than again
[00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:35.840]   almost any place that I have been.
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:41.000]   Now when you move to restaurants and restaurant food, that is where you can have a dramatic
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.760]   difference in cost. Restaurant prices in the United States are modest. They're not nearly
[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:49.360]   as high as many regions of the world, but they're much, much higher than some of the
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:54.280]   well-known cheaper regions of the world. There are places in the world where it just makes
[00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:58.240]   more sense for many people to go out to eat for most of their meals instead of cooking
[00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:03.240]   themselves. That is not the case in the United States. It is the case in even in some expensive
[00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:08.720]   places, Hong Kong or Asia, many parts of Asia. And that partly then goes back to the cost
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:14.600]   of labor. Cost of labor, high in the United States. Cost of labor, low in some corners
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:20.760]   of Asia. And so you can, if you want to eat out a lot, you can gain substantially by going
[00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:24.960]   to an inexpensive corner of the world where you can get a great meal for a few dollars.
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:31.780]   Whether that's taco stand in Mexico or a noodle shop in Bangkok, wherever you wind up, there
[00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:37.240]   are ways that you can save massively on the cost of dining out. Other things associated
[00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:42.280]   with food, it's really a mixed bag. Things like alcohol varies in region. So you'd have
[00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:50.240]   to judge from there. What about cost of things like domestic help? Hiring housekeepers, maids,
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:55.560]   cooks, nannies, things like that. This is an area where I think moving abroad brings
[00:32:55.560 --> 00:33:02.280]   a lot of value. A lot of value by being able to hire domestic help much more cheaply, to
[00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:07.540]   hire servants to work for you much more cheaply. In the United States, with the relatively
[00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:14.420]   high labor costs, hiring full-time servants is basically a rich man's game. It's an unusual
[00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:20.740]   middle class person who has a full-time housekeeper, who has a full-time nanny. That's basically
[00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:25.840]   a rich man's game in the United States. Now to compensate for that, you can find all kinds
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:29.900]   of people who do great work for you on a contractual basis. You can find someone who will come
[00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:35.820]   and clean your house two hours a week. Most people don't need more than that. In addition,
[00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:43.020]   you can also find lots of great electric servants who will work for you. There's a reason why
[00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:47.920]   washing machines and robot vacuums and all those kinds of things can make a big difference.
[00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:52.660]   But if your life would be improved by having a lot of domestic help, you can have major
[00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:57.320]   savings by living in other places. This is, I think, one of those things that most Americans
[00:33:57.320 --> 00:34:04.960]   don't really think about until they start to experience it. If you live in Fiji, as
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:08.600]   a middle class person, you can afford to hire a full-time housekeeper. You can afford to
[00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:14.720]   hire a cook, the housekeeper cooks often for you. I find this one of the major benefits
[00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:20.000]   of living outside of the United States, especially at the phase that my wife and I are in with
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.560]   many young children. It's extremely helpful for her and me not to have to do anything.
[00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:29.400]   Sorry, not to have to do everything. We still do plenty, trust me. But not to have to do
[00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:34.940]   everything. So that can be a major benefit for you at some phases of your life. Now,
[00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:37.860]   on the other hand, there can be a phase of your life you don't need somebody to clean
[00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:40.860]   your house. If you have a little apartment, why do you need someone to come out and be
[00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:49.000]   there full-time working for you? And so in that case, just save the money and get a Roomba.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.480]   And that may be all that you need.
[00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:57.160]   What about other things, purchases, things like furniture, electronics, etc.? My experience,
[00:34:57.160 --> 00:35:01.380]   those things are far cheaper in the United States than almost anywhere else. In the United
[00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:05.120]   States, you can get great, well, first, back to the markets, you can get great stuff for
[00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:09.520]   free all day, every day in the United States, just off the side of the road. Because the
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:15.160]   new market is so healthy, and there's so many people buying new things, it creates this
[00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:21.040]   really robust throwaway market, and there's really robust used market in the United States.
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:25.520]   You can furnish your house for a few dollars and furnish it very well. You can equip your
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:30.700]   house with plenty of working great electronics off the side of the road, or for a few dollars
[00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:35.940]   from any of the secondhand shops or yard sales, Craigslist, etc. And so you can buy those
[00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:39.800]   things in the United States far cheaper than anywhere that I personally have been. Back
[00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:46.240]   again, no VAT tax, relatively modest sales taxes, keep those costs extremely low in the
[00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:47.640]   United States.
[00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:51.520]   My experience, many corners of the world, they're much, much more expensive. You look
[00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:56.000]   at a nice living room set in the United States, be much cheaper than a nice living room set
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:03.880]   in Panama City. It's just a big, big difference there. Things like education should be considered.
[00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:08.260]   Now your cost of education would vary. Is it talking about your education, in which
[00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:12.400]   case a decent internet connection is available, really in most parts of the world at this
[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:17.340]   point in time, many parts of the world at this point in time. Cost of books, it doesn't
[00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:21.480]   get any cheaper to buy used books than Amazon in the United States. One of the best things
[00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:26.880]   about the United States is used books on Amazon, you go on there, boom, $2, $3, $4, you can
[00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:31.700]   get almost any book shipped right to your house ready to go for you. So that can be
[00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:33.400]   a major, major savings.
[00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:38.440]   Now on the flip side, what if you're trying to figure out how to pay for something like
[00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:43.280]   university education? Well, there are many ways to do it very inexpensively in the United
[00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:48.220]   States, lots of great ways, but not really at the higher end, not at the prestigious
[00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:53.640]   schools, et cetera, the prestigious private schools. But you can, any American can move
[00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:58.960]   to Germany and go to school in Germany at the German public universities and not pay
[00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:06.160]   a dime out of pocket for the cost of tuition. And so perhaps there, moving to Germany is
[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:11.240]   much better idea for you to go to the government universities in Germany and not pay anything
[00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:15.840]   than trying to figure out how to come up with $40,000 to pay for private school tuition
[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:20.560]   in Connecticut. So those would be some examples of the cost of living.
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:25.720]   All in all, I think that, hope that what you heard is it's really a mixed bag and that
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:29.640]   there are some categories that are much cheaper in the United States and there are some categories
[00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:34.360]   that are much more expensive in the United States. And a lot of this depends on where
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:41.600]   you are in your life. For me right now, at the phase of life that I'm in, I'm enjoying
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:48.560]   lower taxes by living abroad, which because I'm in years of high earned income, that's
[00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:55.520]   a major benefit to me as having lower taxes. And I'm enjoying lower cost of domestic
[00:37:55.520 --> 00:38:00.560]   help. That's a major benefit for me because it helps my wife and me to be able to keep
[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:05.600]   our household in order to provide the things that we need for our children, et cetera,
[00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:09.720]   so that I can be free and she can be free to do the things that we need to do. Those
[00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:14.160]   are big benefits. A lot of the other things come out in the wash. Housing, I save a little
[00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:18.120]   bit of money on housing, but not much. A lot of other things are more expensive.
[00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:21.720]   Now fast forward to a different phase in life. Let's say I go into a phase of life where
[00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:27.400]   I'm not having high earned income. Well, now the tax savings on earned income are not nearly
[00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:31.720]   so compelling, in which case, and let's say that I'm also at a phase where I just don't
[00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:37.280]   really need any domestic help. I don't want household servants in my house when my children
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:42.120]   are of an age where they are capable of doing the household work. I would view that as being
[00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:46.560]   a negative thing for them to not learn how to work. And so now at a different phase of
[00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:50.280]   life, there could be a different region of the world would make a big, big difference.
[00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:55.280]   If I were a retiree, it's hard to imagine that I would just jump to move outside the
[00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:59.720]   United States. Knowing what I know, I would find a high quality of life in the United
[00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:01.640]   States in many cases.
[00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:09.440]   So let's pivot now to discussion of quality of life. Your quality of life will be subject
[00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:14.000]   to your individual circumstances. There are a lot of things that people don't really think
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:21.120]   about and they really should. For example, something like sunshine. I'm used to growing
[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:26.440]   up. I grew up in the sunshine state. And so I don't think a lot about sunshine, but from
[00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:30.940]   moving around and talking to people, I have learned that this is a big deal and your quality
[00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:37.520]   of life can be dramatically improved by living in a place where there is a lot of sunshine.
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:44.400]   So if you're living in Toronto or you're living in Seattle, one of the biggest quality of
[00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:50.480]   life improvements for you of moving to Puerto Vallarta in Mexico might just simply be the
[00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:56.080]   exposure to sunshine. And yes, you pay a little bit less in housing. Yes, that's nice. And
[00:39:56.080 --> 00:40:00.280]   you don't really worry too much about the income taxes are high in Mexico, but at least
[00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:04.280]   you get access to a lot of sunshine. That's really, really useful. And so that could be
[00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:10.240]   a major quality of life improvement that would be unique to you and it's worth your considering.
[00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:15.300]   Other major improvements of quality of life, things like traffic. Some places have horrendous
[00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:19.700]   traffic and if you just simply move from a place that has horrendous traffic to a place
[00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:24.180]   that doesn't have horrendous traffic, that can be a major quality of life improvement.
[00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:29.640]   You should consider that. But then we get to things like culture. Do you like the culture
[00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:35.560]   that you live in? And I think here you should be very slow to move outside of your home
[00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:40.400]   culture unless you really don't like your home culture or unless you really are more
[00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:46.440]   comfortable in another place. The cultural stuff is a big deal. Now you can find a lot
[00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:52.120]   of cultural sense of belonging, a sense of fitting in, in expat communities all around
[00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:56.680]   the world. You'll find expat communities of people from your home country and you'll be
[00:40:56.680 --> 00:41:02.840]   able to share many things together. I recently celebrated a 4th of July Independence Day
[00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:10.600]   celebration with a bunch of expat Americans. But the culture stuff makes a big, big difference.
[00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:14.120]   There's a big difference between being part of a small group of people from your home
[00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:21.880]   culture than being in your home culture. And I think a lot about this. I try to understand
[00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:26.400]   what things do I like about the US American culture and different expressions of US American
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:31.000]   culture versus what things do I not like, what things do I like more about other cultures.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:36.600]   And that's going to be an intensely subjective process for you. It's going to be an intensely
[00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:42.000]   personal thing, depending again on what you like and what you don't like. But your quality
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.400]   of life might be dramatically improved by moving abroad or it might be dramatically
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:53.440]   made, dramatically worse. I think there are other things. For example, a sense of adventure,
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:58.480]   a sense of adventure. You might enjoy the challenge of living in a new place. It's
[00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:02.600]   kind of fun to have the challenge of figuring out how do I get the lights turned on and
[00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:07.120]   how do I get something delivered from the internet and how do I figure out how to do
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:11.000]   this thing with the immigration department. It adds to a sense of adventure and that can
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   be really, really, really fun. So you'll have to think about your things in terms of
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:24.480]   your quality of life. I believe that depending on what we're talking about, there could
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:32.200]   be dramatic improvements for some people outside of their home country, but it's probably
[00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:40.320]   not the first place to start. I think in general that sense of cultural belonging is a big
[00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:46.360]   deal and it's hard to ever really feel quite so much at home in a place that's not where
[00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:51.680]   you grew up. I don't know if it can be overcome. I interview a lot of expats. I ask them. I
[00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:56.160]   kind of think about this stuff and you have to like the culture I think that you're going
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:43:03.240]   into. For some people, it'll work out. Some people, they'd prefer to be at home. I don't
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:08.280]   mean for this entire show to sound wishy-washy, to not give a clear answer that, "Well, it's
[00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:14.080]   just far better in Panama than it is anywhere else." No, it's not. It's a mixed bag. So
[00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:19.680]   I think that you will have to consider what are the things that you are looking for. I
[00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:22.640]   don't know how long I'll be outside of the United States. A lot of that will depend on
[00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:27.880]   what happens in the United States in the next few years. I didn't leave intending to be
[00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:32.680]   out forever. We'll see what happens in the next few years in the United States, whether
[00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:38.160]   I stay out for the long term or whether I come back. I miss the United States. Last
[00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:45.080]   year, 4th of July last year, I was in Wamego, Kansas. Wamego or Wamego? Little itty-bitty
[00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:51.880]   town in Kansas, a couple hours west of Kansas City. And it has the longest running, I think
[00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:57.200]   their claim to fame is it's the longest running 4th of July Independence Day parade in the
[00:43:57.200 --> 00:44:03.240]   United States since something like the 1850s. And it was the perfect quintessential small
[00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:10.600]   town Independence Day experience. And I was so thrilled to be able to take my children,
[00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:15.520]   let them see the Independence Day parade and do the whole thing. And I loved every minute
[00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:23.720]   of it. Well, that was 4th of July, 2018. 4th of July, 2019, I was with a group of small
[00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:29.840]   group of American expats shooting off fireworks outside of the United States. And it just
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:36.000]   made me miss Wamego, Kansas. Wamego, I should look it up whether it's Wamego or Wamega.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:42.120]   It made me miss Wamego, Kansas, because there's something really special about that small
[00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:47.760]   town flair. Now, I thought about living in Wamego, Kansas, but it doesn't seem to really
[00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:53.560]   fit me. It's not quite what I'm looking for. And so these things are hard to grapple with.
[00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:58.960]   Right now, most of what I, most of the reasons that I'm outside the United States have a
[00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:04.080]   lot to do with what happens five years from now, 10 years from now, and 35 years from
[00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:08.720]   now. Most of what I've been doing is intended to help my children in the long run. And it
[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:12.840]   was a convenient time in my life to do some of this stuff. And I don't know, I don't know
[00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:19.520]   what happens. But I do know this, I have grown pretty frustrated with a lot of things in
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:27.040]   the United States over the past years. But yet, I can appreciate many things about the
[00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:33.840]   United States more, having been gone for a while now, than I did when I was living there.
[00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:40.040]   And it's really, there is no clear and easy answer. There might be a clear and easy answer
[00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:45.480]   for you, perhaps, if you're very, very strong in your thoughts. But I think for most of
[00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:51.360]   us, there probably isn't a clear and easy answer. There probably is more of a sense
[00:45:51.360 --> 00:46:02.200]   of some things that are helpful at a certain phase, and then you live life with an openness
[00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:07.840]   about the future and see what happens. If you're an American, I think you should consider
[00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:13.220]   going abroad at certain times of your life. For example, I think there are major benefits
[00:46:13.220 --> 00:46:19.720]   for a young person to go abroad while they're young, to travel first and foremost. But let's
[00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:24.320]   say you're starting a business, you're starting an internet business. Well, if you can get
[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:31.560]   on an airplane and go to Thailand and be a part of the internet community in Chiang Mai,
[00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:36.240]   Thailand, where you can rent an inexpensive apartment for a few hundred dollars a month,
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:42.160]   you can eat all your meals out for a few dollars a day, and you can spend 80 hours a week working
[00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:48.520]   on your new business, your new online business, and you can simultaneously enjoy the benefits
[00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:54.640]   of limited taxation on your income, allows you to save a lot of money, and you can simultaneously
[00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:58.720]   enjoy the benefits of living in a beautiful tropical location and enjoying the beach and
[00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:03.760]   all of the adventure travel that comes with being there. I think that's a really powerful
[00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:07.440]   proposition. It doesn't have to be all or nothing. If you're like me and you're at a
[00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:13.880]   phase of life where you're going through certain things and you can benefit from some of these
[00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:19.640]   factors, then I think you can do that. You don't have to break up with your home country
[00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:24.280]   completely. You don't have to say, "Well, that's it. I'm going forever." A lot of people
[00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:29.600]   move abroad, find out they like it much better. A lot of people move abroad, find out they
[00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:36.680]   don't like it all that much. The answer of what's right or wrong will depend on you.
[00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:43.360]   I do think this. I think the United States has a very, very strong value proposition.
[00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:49.320]   I think it's a wonderful place to live. The labor market is extremely powerful. If you're
[00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:54.200]   simply willing to learn and willing to work, you can make a lot of money in the United
[00:47:54.200 --> 00:48:00.760]   States. We take that for granted, those of us who were born and raised in that environment.
[00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:04.520]   Every place I go, I look and say, "Well, how would I become a millionaire here?" It is
[00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:08.600]   so much easier for me to see how to do that in the United States than in almost anywhere
[00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:15.200]   else in the world. In many ways, the United States has very modest cost of taxation. Even
[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:20.560]   the taxation can be low as long as you don't earn a lot of wages. It's not low if you have
[00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:29.280]   high wages, but if you restructure your life to make your wages very, very modest, then
[00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:36.600]   your cost of overall taxation can be relatively modest. It's not the lowest tax place in the
[00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:40.720]   world, but it's certainly not the highest tax place in the world. We'll see what the
[00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:42.120]   future holds.
[00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:49.040]   And then the cost of living in the United States can be dirt cheap. It really can be.
[00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:53.120]   Not if you're in the middle of some of the big cities. It's not. High cost of housing
[00:48:53.120 --> 00:49:01.240]   makes a big difference in those scenarios. But you can live inside the United States
[00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:05.800]   and get the benefits of lower cost of living by living outside the city center or in lower
[00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:10.040]   cost places to buy and build a house. You can get some of those benefits by adjusting
[00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:14.480]   the standards of what you're willing to put up with. I could today go to many portions
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:19.320]   of parts of the United States and build a house that would fit my family for $30,000.
[00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:25.760]   I've worked out the numbers on it. I could do it. Question is, do I want to? That's a
[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:30.600]   different question, but I could do it. And I could build a nicer house for $30,000 than
[00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:35.680]   I could buy in many of the so-called cheaper places in the world. And when you get all
[00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:40.600]   the benefits of the cheap flow of goods and the resources just everywhere in the United
[00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:46.240]   States, the resources of the used market, et cetera, somebody who's thrifty, who's resourceful,
[00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:52.680]   who's willing to engage in that, there is so much just stuff everywhere that's not available
[00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:59.560]   in many other places in the rest of the world. So I think the USA has a very, very strong
[00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:05.640]   value proposition. I have some personal reservations of things I'm concerned that might change.
[00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:10.280]   I think they might change in the United States, and if they change, I won't be there. But
[00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:17.440]   time will tell. None of those things are in force today. So what's right for you? Obviously,
[00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:22.440]   think things through. Probably the only way you'll know is by trying it. I don't think
[00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:26.800]   that moving abroad is the answer to everything. I don't think that it automatically fits and
[00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:31.560]   lowers your cost of living and improves your quality of life necessarily. But I do think
[00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:38.240]   it is something that can and should be considered by most people as a way of improving your
[00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:43.280]   life and your lifestyle. It is possible to lower your cost of living and improve your
[00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:49.400]   quality of life if you're clear on what your personal costs of living are and you're clear
[00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:56.640]   on the things that you personally value in a high-quality lifestyle. I guess as I close
[00:50:56.640 --> 00:51:03.040]   today's show, it'd be appropriate for me to take a moment and talk with you about my course,
[00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:08.720]   How to Survive and Thrive During the Coming Economic Crisis. That course has basically
[00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:15.280]   three major parts in my analysis. The third part involves international expatriation as
[00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:21.680]   being a reasonable and worthwhile way to plan to survive and thrive during an economic crisis.
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:28.200]   I'll give you two examples of that. One, it could be possible that your home country,
[00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:34.120]   your home culture could just simply collapse. And that collapse could be caused by various
[00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:41.120]   factors, decline of energy prices or internal cultural strife or civil war, etc. This happens
[00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:46.400]   all around the world all the time. And if you are living in a place where your home
[00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:53.200]   country collapses, one of the best ways to simply continue on with your life is to not
[00:51:53.200 --> 00:52:00.160]   be living there when it collapses. It's so blindingly obvious and yet so under-discussed
[00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:05.280]   that I feel the need to discuss it. The best way to avoid a crisis is not to be living
[00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:11.160]   where there's a crisis happening. And if you think about trying to figure out how to feed
[00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:16.640]   your family right now and living in Caracas, it's a whole lot easier to feed your family
[00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:23.360]   if you're living in London than it is if you're living in Caracas. So this is a big deal.
[00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:28.920]   But then there's other aspect to it. Some things that are crises that could be longer
[00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:34.880]   term. So for example, I've stated here on this show that I don't think the US government
[00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:42.800]   will raise taxes very much on the US population. I don't think that it'll happen. I think that
[00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:48.940]   in the long term, it's my opinion that all of the economic crises in the United States
[00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:53.920]   that are coming in the coming decades will be solved by a combination of inflationary
[00:52:53.920 --> 00:53:01.360]   policies on the money supply and will be solved by just defaulting on various programs in
[00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:06.000]   various ways. I think that's probably the solution that will be moved to rather than
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:12.760]   increasing taxation. However, what if I'm wrong? What if I'm wrong about that? I assume
[00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:16.360]   and I anytime I make a decision, I say, "Okay, what if I'm wrong? And if I'm wrong, then
[00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:21.160]   what's my plan?" Well, people talk about my children are in a situation where they're
[00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:28.240]   going to have to pay for what my grandparents and my parents voted in. Well, who says that
[00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:34.520]   my children have to do that? My parents and my grandparents may have voted in this gargantuan
[00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:40.880]   welfare state that will result in bankruptcy of the US government, but why should my children
[00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:45.500]   have to pay for something that they didn't do? Well, if my children are inextricably
[00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:50.600]   linked to the United States of America, such that they can't live without that little blue
[00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:56.800]   passport and without that US citizen status, then yeah, they might actually be forced by
[00:53:56.800 --> 00:54:04.040]   whoever the government goons wind up in office 20, 30 years from now. My children might be
[00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:11.760]   forced to pay for the things that my parents and grandparents voted for, but I would prefer
[00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:15.980]   to make sure that they have another option. Why should I force that on my children? They
[00:54:15.980 --> 00:54:20.600]   didn't vote for that. They're not responsible for it, so why should they hang out and pay
[00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:26.200]   for it? And so when you get into things like this, problems like these, international expatriation
[00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:32.080]   comes into play as a very reasonable solution, a way to put yourself in a situation where
[00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:40.440]   you can extricate yourself from onerous taxation, from declining societies, declining cultures,
[00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:44.320]   etc. So if you're interested in that kind of thing, I go through all the steps in my
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:48.900]   course called How to Survive and Thrive During the Coming Economic Crisis, and it's helpful
[00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:52.720]   for you if you're worried about just simply losing a job, but it's also helpful for you
[00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:59.640]   if you, like I am, are concerned about, "Well, what do I do if 20 years from now somebody
[00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:04.600]   does actually try to make me and my children pay for the things that my parents and grandparents
[00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:10.400]   voted for?" Well, if somebody tries to do that and actually tries to enforce it, then
[00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:15.080]   I need to be prepared today so that we have an option 20 years from now. And so if that
[00:55:15.080 --> 00:55:19.880]   piques your interest, I hope you'll check it out. Go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/store
[00:55:19.880 --> 00:55:22.680]   and sign up for my course called How to Survive and Thrive During the Coming Economic Crisis.
[00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:29.680]   It's my very best solution for a practical, useful way that's inexpensive to put insurance
[00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:33.320]   policies in place on all these things. And when you put it in the context of what we
[00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:37.540]   talked about today, you can have a lot of fun. You can do really well. And you can do
