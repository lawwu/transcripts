[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.280]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:12.400]   the book of the Acts of the Apostles in the 7th chapter and I'm going to read the first
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.400]   eight verses.
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.680]   Now those who worship here regularly will know that we are looking at this portion of
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.940]   Scripture this evening for the fourth time.
[00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:28.520]   It's a part of this great speech or address, whatever you may like to call it, that was
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:34.560]   delivered by this first martyr Stephen to the great council of the Sanhedrin gathered
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.040]   together in Jerusalem.
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.520]   Stephen's on trial.
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.520]   He's on trial because he's a Christian.
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.560]   Because as a deacon appointed in the early Christian church, he had not only been administering
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.920]   the funds but had also been preaching and teaching and working wonderful miracles.
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.400]   Because of that, the authorities had become offended and they'd arrested him and they'd
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.260]   bring certain charges against him.
[00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.000]   The charges that they'd bring against him is that they had heard him speak blasphemous
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.640]   words against Moses and against God.
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.920]   Furthermore, they raised up false witnesses who repeated this charge of blasphemy against
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.560]   the temple and against the law.
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:23.080]   And in particular, they charged him with saying that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.160]   this temple and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us.
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.520]   Now those are the charges which were brought against him.
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.360]   And here in this speech that is recorded in this seventh chapter of the book of the Acts
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.480]   of the Apostles, Stephen replies to the charge.
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:46.000]   And of course, as we've been seeing, in doing that he also preaches the gospel to them and
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.600]   presents them with the essential case of the Christian gospel.
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.040]   Now what we've seen is something like this.
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.080]   We've seen that what he really does is to give a review of history.
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.640]   And he does that, of course, for a very definite reason.
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.760]   He wants to show these men that they're not only wrong about the Lord Jesus Christ, but
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.560]   they're equally wrong about their own history.
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.120]   They've misunderstood it.
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.960]   They've misunderstood their own religion.
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.520]   They've misunderstood the law.
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.360]   They're wrong about everything.
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.080]   Now he wants to show them that, in order that he might convict them of their error and of
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:31.400]   their wrongness and lead them to a belief in our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.620]   That's his great object, and this is the way in which he does it.
[00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:43.480]   In other words, as I've been trying to show, he reminds us of this very important principle,
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.120]   that the Christian message is not a philosophy.
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.880]   It's not just a teaching.
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:56.000]   It is primarily a record of facts, of events, of actions which have taken place in the course
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.680]   of history.
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.280]   This faith is historical.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:07.040]   That's where it's so different, essentially, from other so-called religions like Confucianism
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.180]   and Buddhism and Mohammedanism and Hinduism and so on.
[00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.440]   This is a record of facts.
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.920]   It is historical, and apart from the history, the message is really not the Christian message.
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.840]   The message is based on and comes out of the history which is put before us.
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:33.640]   And then the next point we saw was that it always starts with the God of glory, not with
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.480]   men, but with God.
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:43.720]   The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, and last Sunday night we were looking
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:50.840]   at it like this, that this God of glory appeared to Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia.
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.660]   Most significant statement.
[00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.760]   He was a pagan there.
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.920]   The world had become pagan.
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:03.000]   The terrible degeneration had taken place following the fall of men, and the world was
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.280]   in a state of paganism and of darkness, and there God appeared to him, reminding us of
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:17.480]   this most important and vital point, that salvation is altogether and entirely of God.
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.680]   All knowledge we have tonight is not the result of our efforts and endeavours, not the result
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:29.640]   of our research or seeking, it is indeed the grace of God which has been pleased to reveal
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.160]   these great and wonderful truths to us.
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:40.640]   The God of glory appeared unto Abraham, and what we saw was that he told him about his
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.480]   plan of redemption.
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.600]   We worked out the relationship of God to the world, and we ended on that note, that God
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:54.440]   has got a plan and a purpose for this world, and he is going to carry it out.
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:03.000]   There is individual salvation, there is to be a cosmic restoration of all things to God.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:12.080]   There is to be a final renovation, a final regeneration, when the whole cosmos and universe
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:18.040]   will be restored to the condition in which God originally made it.
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.240]   We left it at that point.
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.800]   Well, now we must continue this evening.
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.800]   This speech, obviously, is a very basic one, and we are looking at it in order that we
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:33.080]   may discover through it, and by means of it, what exactly the Christian message is.
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:38.760]   This is the great need of the world at this hour, to know what this message is.
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:43.200]   You see the state of the world, you see the futility of everything else.
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.760]   Here is the only hope for the world, there is literally nothing else.
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:52.120]   The world is bankrupt, all human ability comes to nothing.
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.200]   Here is the only hope, but what is it?
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:01.320]   And here to me is the supreme tragedy, that there should be such confusion as to what
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:07.160]   this message is, and that men should substitute their ideas for a gospel that is plain and
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.160]   open before us.
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:14.600]   That is the tragedy of tragedies, and therefore we can do nothing better than go back to these
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:19.480]   early chapters in the book of the Acts of the Apostles and discover how the church started,
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:23.800]   what her message was at the beginning, and here it is in a very perfect manner before
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:24.800]   us.
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.920]   Now, what Stephen was really saying, in a sense, was this.
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:34.000]   He said, why do you object to the preaching concerning Jesus of Nazareth?
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.080]   Why do you regard this as an innovation?
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.400]   You have misunderstood it completely.
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.680]   He is not an innovator, he is a fulfiller.
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:48.240]   Can't you see, says Stephen, and this is what he works out in his speech, can't you
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:56.400]   see that he is nothing but the fulfillment of all the Old Testament promises?
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:01.880]   Now that's the thing he's setting out to demonstrate to them, that God has this plan
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:08.200]   and this purpose, which he has been revealing throughout history in parts and portions,
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:13.240]   as the author of the epistle to the Hebrews puts it, but that it all comes to a focus
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:19.120]   in this blessed person, Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of God.
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.920]   But this is the thing I want to emphasize this evening.
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:31.440]   The purpose of God is one, and it doesn't change, and it's an old purpose, and he is
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:36.400]   bringing it to pass in his own time and in his own way.
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:46.200]   Now, what we're doing immediately here is to show how God revealed this to Abraham.
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:52.380]   God met this man, and he revealed this plan and this purpose to him.
[00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:57.720]   Abraham is a very vital person in this whole matter of the gospel and of salvation.
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:01.880]   You remember how the Apostle Paul, in writing to the Galatians, says that all of us who
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:06.240]   are Christians are, in a sense, the children of Abraham.
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:11.920]   He is the father of all the faithful, children of Abraham, children of faith.
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:17.760]   Even we were Gentiles, if we become Christians, we are children of Abraham.
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.760]   He is pivotal, he is primary in this matter.
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:26.640]   The Jews were always referring to their father Abraham, quite rightly so.
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:32.360]   And there is this sense in which we as Christians must always do the same thing.
[00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:37.640]   But it's very important, therefore, that we should understand in what sense is that true?
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:41.800]   Now that's the thing that Stephen deals with here.
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:49.300]   Now I can imagine that I hear someone saying, "Well, really, what has all that got to do with us?
[00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:53.600]   Why should we be interested in this old history?
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:57.160]   We're in a world of need, in a world of trouble, in a world of pain and of sorrow.
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:01.240]   If you've got anything to give us that can help us, well, why not give it to us?
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:06.520]   Why bother about Abraham and about all we're told about Abraham?"
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:11.000]   I can imagine, says this person, that there was some point in doing so to the members
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.160]   of the Sanhedrin, for they were Jews and religious authorities.
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.640]   But really, I'm not, and I'm not really interested.
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:22.840]   I don't care what happened in the Old Testament, nor what happened to Abraham, nor anything like that.
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.440]   All I want to know is this.
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.200]   In my misery, can you make me happy?
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:31.400]   In my failure, can you give me power that will make me successful?
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:36.200]   In a world which is full of bewilderment, have you something to give me by way of hope?
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:39.100]   I'm not interested in your Bible and all you've got.
[00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:44.280]   Have you got something that you can give me that will send me out smiling, happy and rejoicing?
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:45.280]   That's all I'm interested in.
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:52.700]   Well, now, I imagine somebody saying something like this, "What have we got to say to such a person?"
[00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:56.300]   Now these things, my friends, are of vital importance.
[00:09:56.300 --> 00:10:01.300]   Most people go wrong with regard to this Christian faith in their approach to it.
[00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:05.200]   That's where the trouble comes in, in the approach.
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:10.000]   I've been showing you Sunday by Sunday that the trouble is not with the details.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.100]   It's with the whole total approach.
[00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:15.300]   And here we see this very clearly tonight.
[00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:21.800]   Now what do I say then, by way of reply to somebody who may say, "I don't want it like that."
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:29.300]   Now, to say that, this is my first answer, to say that is not only a dangerous thing and a foolish thing.
[00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:36.300]   It is to make it impossible for yourself ever to experience the blessing of this great Christian salvation.
[00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:39.300]   Why? Well, let me put it like this.
[00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:43.000]   Beggars can't be choosers.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.700]   And the first thing this Gospel tells us all is that we are beggars.
[00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:52.800]   If you haven't seen that you're a beggar, you'll never become a Christian.
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:57.300]   If you think you've got any kind of spiritual currency in your pocket,
[00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:00.800]   you'll never experience this great salvation.
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:05.400]   You don't come to this as you come to anything else in this world.
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:08.500]   You've got to come to this on your knees.
[00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:11.500]   Paul says this is so different from the world, doesn't it?
[00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:16.000]   In the world you come with your mind, your understanding, with your questions.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.800]   You come standing on your feet.
[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:20.800]   If you come like that here, you'll never get it.
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:23.800]   You'll never know anything at all about it.
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:28.400]   Beggars can't be choosers.
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:38.200]   The Gospel never speaks to a man until he realizes that he's got nothing and is nothing.
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:44.100]   Now, I could easily illustrate what I'm saying by many contemporary person's personalities,
[00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:47.500]   perhaps I ought to say, to use the current jargon,
[00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:51.400]   who are interested in these matters but who stumble.
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.500]   That's why they stumble.
[00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:58.100]   They come to Jesus Christ standing on their own feet.
[00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:00.700]   They'll never know him like that.
[00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:04.200]   There's only one way to approach him and that is on your knees
[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:08.900]   or perhaps even lying prostrate on the ground.
[00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:11.400]   Beggars can't be choosers.
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:14.300]   That's my first answer. My second answer is this.
[00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:20.700]   We have got, in other words, to accept this salvation in God's way.
[00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:22.700]   It is his salvation.
[00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:25.900]   It is the God of glory who appeared to Abraham.
[00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:28.400]   It is he who decides.
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:31.600]   In other words, our Lord, you remember, put it like this.
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:35.700]   He said, "Except ye be converted and become as little children,
[00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:39.500]   ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven."
[00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:43.300]   That's true of adult men and women as well as of all others.
[00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:45.800]   You've got to become as little children.
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:50.400]   In other words, you've got to come admitting that you don't know and that you don't possess.
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:52.800]   You've got to take it in God's way.
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:56.000]   Now, I'd be misleading you if I didn't say this.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.400]   You may say, "Oh, but that's intolerant."
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:03.200]   All right, as long as you go on thinking and saying that, you'll never experience it.
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:09.800]   You've got to come to the end of yourself and then be ready to receive this as it is offered to you.
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:16.000]   It is God's way of salvation, and it must be accepted in God's way.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.900]   Now, let me put that in this form because this is such a vital matter.
[00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:28.300]   We mustn't view this Christian salvation as the cults tend to view these matters.
[00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:29.900]   You know the cults.
[00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:33.600]   The cults are always offering us just what we need.
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:38.200]   "Want to get rid of your worries? All right, we can do it. We've got a formula.
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:41.800]   Want to get rid of your aches and pains? All right, we've got another formula."
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:48.300]   The cults start with us and our needs, and they're just agencies to supply our needs.
[00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:52.000]   But my friend, the gospel isn't that.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:58.800]   It isn't just an agency to supply our needs, give us something that we think we need.
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:00.800]   You see, this is our trouble.
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:02.800]   We don't know what we need.
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:06.800]   We all think that what we need is happiness, but it isn't.
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:08.800]   There's something more important than happiness.
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:10.700]   It is holiness.
[00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:13.000]   It is the knowledge of God.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.400]   It is a life shared with God.
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:17.000]   That's what we need.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.100]   We don't know our needs.
[00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:22.100]   But you see, we approach these things as if we did,
[00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:26.300]   and then we come to this as we go to the cults and what the world has.
[00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:28.200]   But it's no good.
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.900]   We mustn't. Why not?
[00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:34.700]   Well, because the primary object and purpose of salvation
[00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:41.200]   is not to supply the needs of men, but is to glorify God.
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:45.300]   It is to vindicate the glory of God.
[00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:48.000]   And our benefits are incidental.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.600]   Now, we've got to view it like that.
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.100]   I know that this is abhorrent to the modern man.
[00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:54.100]   He hates this. He detests it.
[00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:55.500]   He feels it's insulting.
[00:14:55.500 --> 00:15:00.600]   All right, as long as he does so, he'll go on the miserable failure that he is,
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.700]   and he'll die in darkness and despair,
[00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:09.100]   without a hope to cheer the gloom and the tomb.
[00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:11.700]   It is the glory of God.
[00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:15.600]   The God of glory appeared unto Abraham.
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:18.200]   There's another reason why it must be accepted like this,
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.800]   and why it's presented to us like this.
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:24.400]   It is, of course, to humble us.
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:26.400]   And we all need to be humbled,
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:29.100]   especially the men of the 20th century,
[00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:32.800]   whose main trouble is his pride and his arrogance.
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:36.900]   He's no worse than his predecessors, except that he talks more about it.
[00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:39.000]   He's got agencies that enable him to do so,
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.800]   books, television, wireless, and all these things.
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.500]   And here he is constantly doing it,
[00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:47.200]   and he must be humbled and humbled to the dust.
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:50.000]   One of the first things we all have to get rid of
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.700]   is this talk about the 20th century.
[00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:55.100]   It's completely irrelevant.
[00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:58.900]   It's got nothing to do with this question at all.
[00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:03.500]   It is a sheer red herring in these matters.
[00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:07.000]   So the Gospel comes to us in this way, and it humbles us.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.600]   But, and this is the most glorious aspect of the whole thing,
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.600]   as far as I'm concerned,
[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:16.000]   why am I putting the Gospel to you like this, this evening?
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.300]   Well, here is my final answer.
[00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:22.600]   It is to give you absolute certainty.
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:25.500]   It is to give you security.
[00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:28.400]   It is to show you that the Christian Gospel
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:32.400]   is not just some little thing,
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:37.700]   but is the biggest and the most glorious and wonderful thing in the universe.
[00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:42.400]   Not just something that can give me a little bit of help as I want it, no, no.
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:46.800]   It makes me forget myself, and I'm lost in wonder, love, and praise,
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:51.800]   as I look into the abyss of the eternal God and his everlasting love
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.600]   in his only begotten Son.
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:56.200]   That's why I'm putting it to you like this.
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:59.200]   Now then, there's the introduction.
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.000]   Come to the details.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   We ended last Sunday night by saying that
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   God has a plan of redemption.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.700]   That it is concerned about individual redemption,
[00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:16.900]   but that it is also concerned about the redemption of the cosmos.
[00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:19.800]   Let's look at this plan a little bit further.
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:24.100]   When did this plan come into being?
[00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:29.300]   When did God conceive this great plan and purpose
[00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:33.100]   of redeeming the entire cosmos?
[00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:36.000]   Here's an important question.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.800]   And you see the answer is, it's put before us in many places in the Bible,
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:46.800]   He did this before the foundation of the world.
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:50.800]   Before the world was ever made, God planned its redemption.
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:53.300]   Why? Well, because he is the God of glory.
[00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:55.200]   He knows all things.
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.500]   He knew what man was going to do.
[00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:00.300]   So the Apostle Paul puts it to the Corinthians in these terms,
[00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:02.900]   "We speak the wisdom of God in a mystery,
[00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:05.800]   even the hidden wisdom which God ordained
[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:09.900]   before the foundation of the world."
[00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:15.900]   Now this is the thing I say in which I glory.
[00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:18.900]   You see, we are so much 20th century people,
[00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:23.200]   and we are so self-centered, and we are so self-important.
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:26.300]   We think the world has never been as it is now,
[00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:29.100]   and that our problems are altogether new,
[00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:32.000]   and we talk about our scientific knowledge,
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.500]   and all the advances and so on.
[00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:36.000]   Here's the answer to it.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.900]   The world is an old world, and it's the same old world
[00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:44.900]   that it was in the time when Abram was still living in Mesopotamia,
[00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:50.200]   and even before that, the same old world.
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:53.100]   Our problems are not new.
[00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:56.100]   There is nothing confronting us tonight
[00:18:56.100 --> 00:19:00.500]   which has not confronted the human race ever since it rebelled against God
[00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:04.400]   and brought down misery and curse upon itself.
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.300]   Nothing new at all.
[00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:09.900]   The first thing this generation needs is to be shattered,
[00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:12.800]   is to be humbled to the dust.
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:17.200]   History shows us that man has not changed at all.
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.300]   Thank God for this, I say.
[00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:22.200]   And we are confronted not by some new theory
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.500]   that's going to suit the 20th century men.
[00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:29.000]   We are confronted by God's plan and purpose of salvation and redemption,
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.500]   which he planned and purposed before the foundation of the world.
[00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:39.700]   That's the way to bring the modern men to his knees and to the dust.
[00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:42.300]   Where's your self-importance now?
[00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:43.800]   No, no.
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:47.000]   Forget all about it and realize you're just men,
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.600]   full men, failure as men,
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:54.600]   and that your needs are the needs that have been true of mankind
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:59.400]   from this very beginning, and thank God.
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:02.800]   I realize that I'm not in some contingent condition.
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:06.900]   I'm not waiting for some new idea, some new inspiration here or there.
[00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:11.300]   I'm face to face with a God who's seen it all and planned it all
[00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:14.300]   from beginning to end before even the world was made
[00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:18.000]   and before men ever came into existence.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.800]   But another thing I'm reminded of is this,
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:24.000]   that it is a detailed plan.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.900]   And if you don't find comfort in these things, I only come to one conclusion,
[00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:31.400]   that is, you're not a Christian and you don't know what the gospel is.
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:32.900]   It's a very detailed plan.
[00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:36.100]   Did you notice this in those verses that I've just read to you?
[00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:37.700]   This is what I read.
[00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:43.700]   God spake on this wise, that his seed should sojourn in a strange land
[00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:48.600]   and that they should bring them into bondage and entreat them evil
[00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:52.000]   four hundred years.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.200]   Now God said that to Abram long before it ever happened.
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:21:02.600]   There's only one conclusion to draw, and that is that God is in control of it all.
[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:07.200]   That God is above it all, that God has determined it all.
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:11.600]   He knows when to call Abram in Mesopotamia.
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:14.000]   He knows when the people are to go down to Egypt,
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.300]   how long they're to stay there, when they're to come back.
[00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:21.000]   All these things are known to God.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.500]   My dear friend, do you find comfort and consolation in this?
[00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:28.300]   This is the test of whether you're a Christian or not.
[00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:32.000]   Doesn't it comfort you? Doesn't it thrill you with joy?
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.300]   To know that there's nothing happening apart from God.
[00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:39.500]   That he knows all about it. He knows it all in detail.
[00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:42.700]   Now these are the terms that are used constantly in the Bible.
[00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:45.000]   The fullness of time.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.100]   When the fullness of the times have come,
[00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:51.400]   God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law.
[00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:55.300]   Look at all this element of prophecy in the Bible.
[00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:57.600]   What makes prophecy possible?
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:02.400]   The only thing that makes prophecy possible is that God knows everything.
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:04.500]   And that God is behind everything.
[00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:06.700]   That God has a perfect plan.
[00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:09.300]   It is all mapped out, it's all marked out.
[00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:13.200]   God knew from the beginning when certain things were going to be done.
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:16.200]   And they come with an absolute regularity.
[00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:21.100]   And you stand back and you watch the fulfilling of prophecy in minute details.
[00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:25.200]   And if you've got eyes at all to see, you say there's only one explanation.
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:29.600]   It is God's purpose. It is God's plan.
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:32.000]   Nothing happens accidentally.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   God is above all and everything is under God.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:41.600]   He's in all and through all and above all God blessed forever.
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:49.800]   And so you see, it comes to me this evening and it gives me this great consolation.
[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:53.800]   That the future of this world is known to God.
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:55.800]   We are immersed in it of course.
[00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:59.300]   And we're reading our history and the biographies are coming out.
[00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:02.400]   And we read recent history and a little more remote history.
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:08.300]   And it's all so important and filled and we get excited.
[00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:10.300]   How does it help us?
[00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:12.100]   What does it give us?
[00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:14.800]   What does it contribute to our understanding?
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:17.300]   And the answer is nothing.
[00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:23.300]   It is indeed, as Shakespeare put it, a tale told by an idiot, signifying nothing.
[00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:28.300]   And all the fuss and the excitement and all the sophistication and all the clever talk.
[00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:31.100]   What's the value of it? Nil.
[00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:34.800]   What do they know of the future? They know nothing.
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:38.300]   But you see, this message tells me this.
[00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:42.800]   That the God who planned the beginning has also planned the end.
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:47.300]   I can't tell you in detail what the future of the world is going to be.
[00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:51.800]   But there are certain things that I know perfectly well and perfectly clearly.
[00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:57.800]   I can tell you tonight with absolute confidence, with no fear whatsoever of being contradicted.
[00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:04.300]   That this world is not only not getting better and better, it never will get better.
[00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:06.800]   It is an evil world.
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:13.300]   And all the talk about getting better and evolution and improvement is just the figment of men's imagination.
[00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:16.300]   It isn't true. It never has been, it never will be.
[00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:21.300]   The world is an evil world and there is no hope for it as such.
[00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:25.300]   I can tell you this. It's the message.
[00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:32.800]   But I do know at the same time that there is to be an end to history.
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:36.800]   From now until the end, I don't know how long it's going to be.
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:40.300]   I have every reason for thinking that things will get worse and worse.
[00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:44.300]   That evil men will wax worse and worse.
[00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:47.300]   That there shall be wars and rumors of wars.
[00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:53.300]   That there shall be pestilences, earthquakes, accidents, starvation.
[00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:56.300]   All the things that are happening in the modern world.
[00:24:56.300 --> 00:25:01.300]   This kind of thing is to go on and to continue and to increase.
[00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:03.800]   But I know this also.
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:06.800]   That there is a day appointed.
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:10.300]   When God will send his son again back into this world.
[00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:12.800]   And wind up history.
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:14.800]   And judge all men.
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:18.300]   Evil and sin will be banished and destroyed and punished.
[00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:20.800]   And he will set up that kingdom of glory.
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:22.300]   I don't know when.
[00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:26.300]   Our Lord when he was in this world said that he didn't know when.
[00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:28.800]   He said the day and the hour were not even known to him.
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:30.800]   Nor to the angels in heaven.
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:33.300]   But only unto the Father.
[00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:36.300]   The God of glory has got a plan.
[00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:39.800]   And the whole plan is in detail before him.
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:42.300]   It's open and it's being brought to pass.
[00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:46.300]   Now I say what a comfort this is in a world like this.
[00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:48.800]   This world isn't in our hands.
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:51.300]   It's in the hands of God.
[00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:55.300]   And nothing can frustrate his eternal purposes.
[00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:57.300]   Here's one thing I discovered.
[00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:59.300]   But let me hurry on to another.
[00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:01.800]   Did you notice this word covenant.
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:06.300]   And he gave him the covenant of circumcision.
[00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:10.800]   And did you notice the constant reference to that word covenant.
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:13.300]   In the 17th chapter of Genesis.
[00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:15.300]   Which we read at the beginning.
[00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:17.300]   Now here's another most important word.
[00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:20.800]   We've already met it in the third chapter.
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:23.800]   Of this same book of Acts in verse 25.
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:26.800]   Peter preaching at Jerusalem had said this.
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:29.800]   You are the children of the prophets.
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:34.300]   And of the covenant which God made with our fathers.
[00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:36.300]   Saying unto Abraham.
[00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:42.300]   And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.
[00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:44.300]   Unto you first.
[00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:47.300]   God having raised up his son Jesus sent him to bless you.
[00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:51.800]   In turning away every one of you from his iniquities.
[00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:53.800]   Now that's Peter referring to it.
[00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:57.300]   Now here we've got Stephen doing exactly the same thing.
[00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:58.800]   Covenant.
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:00.800]   What does this mean?
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:06.300]   You can't read your Bible intelligently without knowing something of the meaning of this word covenant.
[00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:08.300]   It's a most wonderful word.
[00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:10.800]   This is what it means in its essence.
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:13.800]   That this great God of glory.
[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:15.800]   The God who is self-existent.
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:18.300]   And who doesn't need us and doesn't need the world.
[00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:20.800]   Is sufficient in and of himself.
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:26.300]   But who in his own wisdom and goodness created the world and created men.
[00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:31.300]   And then men sinned against him and rebelled against him and turned his back upon him.
[00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:33.300]   Oh here's the meaning of covenant.
[00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:36.300]   That that same God of glory.
[00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:40.300]   Not only visited men and appeared to him.
[00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:43.800]   But he told him what he was going to do.
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:52.300]   About him and about the world and about the whole need of the human race and of the whole universe.
[00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:54.800]   God said that he was going to do it.
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:56.300]   But he goes further.
[00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:58.300]   He pledges himself to do it.
[00:27:58.300 --> 00:27:59.800]   He went even further.
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:02.300]   He swore an oath.
[00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:05.800]   He swore by his own name to Abraham.
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:08.800]   That he was going to do this very thing.
[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:13.800]   Now notice it isn't a kind of bargain between God and men.
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:15.300]   It's never that.
[00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:18.800]   A covenant is entirely from the side of God.
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:24.800]   It isn't two parties coming together as equals and making an agreement and appending their names to it.
[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:25.800]   No, no.
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:31.800]   It is God coming down with the plan and saying here is my plan for you.
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:32.800]   I have made it.
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:33.800]   I have signed it.
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:34.800]   I have sealed it.
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:36.800]   I give it to you.
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:37.800]   Covenant.
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:38.800]   His promise.
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:40.800]   His purpose.
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:47.800]   Not a bargain, I say, but a free act of God's eternal grace.
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:54.800]   And giving us this assurance that he is going to redeem the universe.
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:59.800]   Now, you'll find many examples of this in the Old Testament.
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:04.800]   God made a covenant with Noah after the flood.
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:08.800]   The world had been destroyed by a flood.
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:14.800]   But after Noah and his family were brought out of the ark, God gave a pledge.
[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:15.800]   He made a covenant.
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:19.800]   He stated that he would never do that again.
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:25.800]   And you and I can be certain that this world is not going to be destroyed by a flood.
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:26.800]   It has happened once.
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:27.800]   That will never happen again.
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:28.800]   How do I know that?
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:31.800]   Well, God has stated it in covenant form.
[00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:32.800]   And he has given a sign.
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:38.800]   The sign was that he chose to use the rainbow as the sign of the covenant.
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:40.800]   And there it stands.
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:46.800]   And every time you see a rainbow, you should remind yourself that whatever else happens to this world,
[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:50.800]   it's never going to be destroyed again by a flood.
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:55.800]   We know that it is going to be destroyed by a kind of conflagration.
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:58.800]   The elements will melt with fervent heat, etc.
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:01.800]   But there is an illustration of a covenant.
[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:04.800]   The covenant that God made with Noah.
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:07.800]   And here you see he made a covenant with Abraham.
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:09.800]   And he gave him a new sign.
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:14.800]   And this time it was the sign of circumcision.
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:16.800]   Most significant.
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:20.800]   Indicating not only separateness, but purity and holiness.
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:23.800]   For God is a holy God.
[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:26.800]   And God's not going to make sinful people happy.
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:28.800]   If you want to be happy, you've got to become holy.
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:31.800]   Circumcision, a cutting away.
[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:33.800]   These things are fundamental.
[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:35.800]   You say, but I've come in to have a bit of comfort.
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:39.800]   My dear friend, you'll never have comfort in this world until you're a holy person.
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:42.800]   Related to that holy God.
[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:45.800]   The sign of circumcision.
[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:50.800]   And there are many other examples and illustrations that I could give you.
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:53.800]   God made this covenant.
[00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:57.800]   And he repeated the covenant with Isaac, the son of Abraham.
[00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:00.800]   And with Jacob, the son of Isaac.
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:02.800]   And he's gone on repeating it.
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:04.800]   He repeated it to Moses.
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:06.800]   He repeated it to King David.
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:09.800]   There's nothing so wonderful as you read your Old Testament.
[00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:11.800]   As to keep your eye on this covenant.
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:13.800]   You sometimes get lost in details.
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:16.800]   And you see the children of Israel wandering away and doing this and that.
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:19.800]   Then God brings them back and the covenant is repeated.
[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:22.800]   And you see God's plan going right on.
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:24.800]   That this Messiah is to come.
[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:26.800]   And out of the tribe of Judah.
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:28.800]   And out of the seed of David.
[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:31.800]   And on it goes from detail to detail.
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:36.800]   Now this is the importance of this great word, covenant.
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:41.800]   And you see when the Lord Jesus Christ was born.
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:47.800]   This was the thing that immediately was noticed by those who were enlightened by the Holy Spirit.
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:51.800]   You remember Zacharias, the father of John the Baptist.
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:53.800]   He was given a glimpse of this.
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:56.800]   And this is how he breaks out into song.
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:58.800]   Blessed, he says, be the Lord God of Israel.
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:01.800]   For he hath visited and redeemed his people.
[00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:06.800]   And hath raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David.
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:09.800]   As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets.
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:11.800]   Which have been since the world began.
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:14.800]   That we should be saved from our enemies.
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:16.800]   And from the hand of all that hate us.
[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:20.800]   To perform the mercy promised to our fathers.
[00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:24.800]   And to remember his holy covenant.
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:27.800]   Zacharias says it at once.
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:29.800]   Stephen is just repeating this.
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:32.800]   He turns to the members of the Sanhedrin and says.
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:33.800]   What's the matter with you?
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:34.800]   Don't you know your Bibles?
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:36.800]   Don't you know your own history?
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:38.800]   Don't you know about the covenants?
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:41.800]   This Jesus whom you are reviling and rejecting.
[00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:43.800]   He is the promised one.
[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:48.800]   The center of the very covenant that God made with our father Abraham.
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:50.800]   What a vital point this is.
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:52.800]   You see there is nothing accidental.
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:54.800]   Nothing contingent.
[00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:58.800]   Nothing thought of suddenly in the light of something that happens.
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:32:59.800]   No, no.
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:02.800]   Before the foundation of the world.
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:03.800]   And what God does.
[00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:05.800]   He takes this man Abraham and he says.
[00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:07.800]   Look here, I want to let you into the secret.
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:09.800]   I want to tell you what I am going to do.
[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:11.800]   And you are going to be a vital part of it.
[00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:12.800]   Now then, come along.
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:14.800]   Come out.
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:18.800]   This is the beginning, as it were, of this mighty process.
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:20.800]   That's what Stephen is saying.
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:22.800]   And you see its relevance to us.
[00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:25.800]   But let me show you it's still more.
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:32.800]   This purpose of God, this covenant, is based upon the power of God.
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:39.800]   And here is something again that is essential and vitally important.
[00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:45.800]   This way of salvation that I am privileged to preach to you is miraculous.
[00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:48.800]   It is miraculous from beginning to end.
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:49.800]   Not natural.
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:53.800]   Supernatural.
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:59.800]   The type of Christian I can't understand is the man who is afraid of the miraculous and the supernatural.
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:00.800]   The scientists won't believe this.
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:02.800]   Of course they won't.
[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:04.800]   They have never believed this kind of thing.
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:06.800]   That's why the world is as it is.
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:11.800]   But if this gospel were not miraculous, it wouldn't save any of us.
[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:14.800]   You remember the story of Abram and his wife Sarah, don't you?
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:17.800]   Abram is 99 and Sarah over 90.
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:23.800]   And God comes to them and tells them that they are going to have this child.
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:27.800]   Listen to the account in the 18th chapter of Genesis.
[00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:31.800]   These heavenly visitants come to Abram again and they said unto him,
[00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:33.800]   Where is Sarah thy wife?
[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:35.800]   And he said, Behold in the tent.
[00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:39.800]   And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life.
[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:42.800]   And lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son.
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:46.800]   And Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him.
[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:50.800]   Now Abram and Sarah were old and well stricken in age.
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:54.800]   And it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:56.800]   I don't apologize for reading things like this.
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:57.800]   I'm dealing with facts, you know.
[00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:59.800]   With facts of history.
[00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:00.800]   Let's be realistic.
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:01.800]   Let's face them.
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:05.800]   Sarah laughed within herself saying, After I am waxed old,
[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:10.800]   Shall I have pleasure, my Lord, of being old also?
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:15.800]   And the Lord said unto Abram, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying,
[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:19.800]   Shall I of a surety bear a child which am old?
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:24.800]   Is anything too hard for the Lord?
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:26.800]   That's it.
[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:31.800]   At the time appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life.
[00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:35.800]   And Sarah shall have a son.
[00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:37.800]   And she had one.
[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:42.800]   And there you see a reminder at the very beginning of this great history of redemption.
[00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:47.800]   That this is a miraculous message, a miraculous redemption.
[00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:51.800]   The birth of Isaac proves it at the very beginning.
[00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:55.800]   The coming of Isaac was a sheer impossibility in terms of nature.
[00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:57.800]   To science it is something that cannot happen.
[00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:00.800]   An absolute impossibility.
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:04.800]   To worldly wisdom, of course it is quite unthinkable.
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:07.800]   But it happened.
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:13.800]   And the whole of our salvation is miraculous from beginning to end.
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:17.800]   Now you go back and read the history.
[00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:23.800]   There is this reference here to the children of Israel being down in Egypt for 400 years.
[00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:26.800]   And of their becoming slaves.
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:30.800]   And of their being treated very cruelly by the Egyptians.
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:33.800]   And it all came to pass.
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:35.800]   And they were completely helpless and defenseless.
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:38.800]   They'd got no armaments, they'd got nothing.
[00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:45.800]   And they were forced to make bricks, not given sufficient straw to enable them to do so, and so on.
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:47.800]   And the taskmasters on the lashings of the whip.
[00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:50.800]   A completely hopeless situation.
[00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:53.800]   What hope of them? Can they ever come out?
[00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:54.800]   Can anything be done for them?
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:57.800]   From the standpoint of men, nothing whatsoever.
[00:36:57.800 --> 00:36:59.800]   But they came out.
[00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:03.800]   And they came out as the result of God's miracles.
[00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:05.800]   And then there they are.
[00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:10.800]   Piahireth, Beelzebub, two mountains, one on each side.
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:12.800]   In front of them the Red Sea.
[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:15.800]   Behind them Pharaoh and his hosts and his chariots.
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:18.800]   They're hemmed in, they're caught, they're finished.
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:19.800]   Not at all.
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:24.800]   The Red Sea divided, opened before them and they went through on dry land.
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:25.800]   This is history.
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:28.800]   You say, but that kind of thing is impossible.
[00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:30.800]   It is, I agree, with men.
[00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:32.800]   Men can't do that sort of thing.
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:33.800]   But God did it.
[00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:35.800]   This is the history.
[00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:37.800]   God brought them through.
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:39.800]   Not only the Red Sea, he led them through the wilderness.
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:42.800]   He divided the River Jordan for them.
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:44.800]   Read your Old Testament history.
[00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:47.800]   Look at this little nation, this apparently helpless nation.
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:51.800]   Look at them conquering great dynasties, great empires.
[00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:54.800]   Look at this little nation, insignificant people,
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:58.800]   towering above all others in the time of a king like David.
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:37:59.800]   How do you explain it?
[00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:01.800]   There's only one answer.
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:06.800]   It is the miraculous, supernatural power of God.
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:10.800]   And were it not this, I say, I'd have no message to offer you this evening.
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:12.800]   But this is my message.
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:18.800]   I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:22.800]   unto salvation to everyone that believeth.
[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:26.800]   If it were not the power of God, it wouldn't be a gospel.
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:28.800]   Man cannot save man.
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:30.800]   I cannot save myself.
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:31.800]   I can't save anybody else.
[00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:33.800]   Nobody can save me.
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:36.800]   You are sociologists and politicians and philosophers.
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:37.800]   They can't save themselves.
[00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:39.800]   They can't save me.
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:40.800]   They can't save the world.
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:44.800]   It is God alone that can save, and God can.
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:47.800]   Is anything too hard for the Lord?
[00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:50.800]   That was what was said to Abraham and to Sarah.
[00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:53.800]   And here it is, you see, at the very beginning.
[00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:55.800]   You see now why Stephen goes back to Abram?
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:57.800]   You see why he's so interested in history?
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:02.800]   All the basic principles of the Christian salvation were stated there
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:05.800]   and that way at the very beginning to Abraham.
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:11.800]   But of course it follows from that that because it is miraculous and supernatural,
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:15.800]   it is entirely beyond man's understanding.
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:18.800]   Abram didn't understand it.
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:21.800]   Sarah understood it still less.
[00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:27.800]   But thank God our salvation does not depend upon our understanding.
[00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:30.800]   If it did, there'd be nobody saved.
[00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:33.800]   But that is the fatal error of the modern man.
[00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:34.800]   He wants to understand.
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:36.800]   I don't understand your salvation.
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:39.800]   And because he doesn't understand it, he rejects it.
[00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:42.800]   And he remains the miserable failure that he is.
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:45.800]   And his world goes on from bad to worse.
[00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:51.800]   And he'll die, I say, in darkness and without a hope.
[00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:52.800]   Understanding.
[00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:56.800]   Of course you can't understand.
[00:39:56.800 --> 00:40:01.800]   Abram and Sarah say to God, "Why not Ishmael?"
[00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:08.800]   That boy that had been born, you remember, from the maid of Sarah.
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:09.800]   Hagar.
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:10.800]   Here he is.
[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:12.800]   Abram's son.
[00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:14.800]   "Why not Ishmael?" says Abraham.
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:15.800]   Seems so natural, doesn't it?
[00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:17.800]   He's already here.
[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:19.800]   It's impossible that Sarah should have a child.
[00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:20.800]   She's over 90.
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:21.800]   I'm 99.
[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:22.800]   But look here, here's Ishmael.
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:23.800]   He is my son.
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:25.800]   Why not make him the heir?
[00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:26.800]   Why not give him the promise?
[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:27.800]   That's how man thinks.
[00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:28.800]   Man thinks he knows.
[00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:31.800]   And he even tells God what God ought to do.
[00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:35.800]   And that's the final folly of this modern age and generation.
[00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:40.800]   That it ventures to criticize God and to suggest to him and to propose to him.
[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:46.800]   And to ask for modifications and say, "Why not do it like this, my Ishmael?"
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:50.800]   Man doesn't understand.
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:56.800]   But thank God, I say, we are saved in spite of our inability to understand.
[00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:59.800]   God said through Isaiah the same thing.
[00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:02.800]   "My thoughts are not your thoughts."
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:05.800]   "Neither are my ways your ways," saith the Lord.
[00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:11.800]   "For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my thoughts and your thoughts and my ways and your ways."
[00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:13.800]   Understand?
[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:15.800]   Of course not.
[00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:18.800]   Did you notice how Paul put it there to the Corinthians?
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:21.800]   We preach wisdom among them that are perfect.
[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:26.800]   Yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that come to naught.
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:30.800]   But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery.
[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:31.800]   A mystery.
[00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:37.800]   Even a hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world and to our glory.
[00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:39.800]   The mystery of redemption.
[00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:41.800]   The mystery of salvation.
[00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:44.800]   Thank God it is a mystery.
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:46.800]   What are you trying to understand?
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:49.800]   You're trying to understand the God of glory.
[00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:53.800]   You're trying to understand three persons and yet but one God.
[00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:57.800]   You're trying to understand the infinite, the absolute, the eternal.
[00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:01.800]   You're trying to understand the person of Christ.
[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:03.800]   Two natures in one person.
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:04.800]   You say it's impossible.
[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:05.800]   I know.
[00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:06.800]   It is impossible to men.
[00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:08.800]   Men can't understand.
[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:09.800]   This is a mystery.
[00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:11.800]   It's altogether beyond men.
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:18.800]   As the way of salvation was beyond Abraham and Sarah, all of it is entirely beyond men.
[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:25.800]   But my dear friend, the first thing you and I've got to do is to realize that we mustn't even try to understand it.
[00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:27.800]   It is God's.
[00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:32.800]   And it is the mind of the eternal and the everlasting God.
[00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:36.800]   It is something that he thought out before he even made the world actually.
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:39.800]   And here it is, the mystery of God.
[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:41.800]   The mystery of Godliness.
[00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:43.800]   The mystery of the triune God.
[00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:48.800]   The mystery of this blessed person who is fully God and fully men at the same time.
[00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:51.800]   Two natures unmixed.
[00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:55.800]   And the mystery of the new birth.
[00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:58.800]   This is the heart of the gospel of salvation.
[00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:00.800]   What do you and I need by nature?
[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:02.800]   We need to be born again.
[00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:04.800]   But you see, you can't be born again.
[00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:06.800]   As the man is, he will be.
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:08.800]   You're born with a given nature, you'll always have it.
[00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:11.800]   You've got certain radical defects, you'll never get rid of them.
[00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:13.800]   You can't start afresh.
[00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:16.800]   Can the Ethiopian change his skin or the leopard his spots?
[00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:18.800]   Of course they cannot.
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:22.800]   But here is a gospel which says you must be born again.
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:24.800]   You can be born again.
[00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:26.800]   You can have a new start, a new beginning.
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:29.800]   You can have a new nature, you can be a new man.
[00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:30.800]   This is a miracle.
[00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:33.800]   It's a new creation.
[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:35.800]   Man doesn't understand it.
[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:37.800]   Of course he doesn't.
[00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:40.800]   Is Ibram and Isaac having a child at their age?
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:41.800]   Impossible.
[00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:43.800]   But not with God.
[00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:46.800]   Is anything too hard for the Lord?
[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:49.800]   Oh, here's the glory of preaching this gospel.
[00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:53.800]   I may be addressing at this moment someone who has lived such a life of sin
[00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:58.800]   that he's lost not only his willpower but his very self-respect.
[00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:00.800]   He's weary and tired of taking resolutions.
[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:02.800]   His family have pleaded with him.
[00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:03.800]   He's signed resolutions.
[00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:04.800]   He's done everything.
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:05.800]   He cannot.
[00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:06.800]   He's hopeless.
[00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:07.800]   He's vile.
[00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:10.800]   He's sunk in iniquity.
[00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:16.800]   But you know, I preach as confidently to such a man as I do to the most respectable person in this congregation.
[00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:17.800]   Why?
[00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:24.800]   Oh, because I am preaching the power of a God who could create a world out of nothing
[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:27.800]   and keeps it going by the word of His power.
[00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:32.800]   A God who can take the poorest, vilest nature
[00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:38.800]   and renovate it and renew it and fashion it after the image of His own dear Son.
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:41.800]   Oh, give up being foolish.
[00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:44.800]   Give up trying to understand the mystery of God.
[00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:46.800]   Charles Wesley saw it all.
[00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:47.800]   Listen to him.
[00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:49.800]   It is mystery all.
[00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:55.800]   The immortal dies who can explore His strange design.
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:45:02.800]   In vain the firstborn seraph tries to sound the depths of love divine.
[00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:05.800]   It is mercy all.
[00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:08.800]   Let earth adore.
[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:14.800]   Let angel minds inquire no more.
[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:21.800]   Not only can men not understand this, the angels in heaven can't understand it.
[00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:24.800]   It is God alone who understands it.
[00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:25.800]   God the Father.
[00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:27.800]   God the Son.
[00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:29.800]   God the Holy Spirit.
[00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:31.800]   He tells, He reveals His plan.
[00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:33.800]   He makes His covenant with Abram.
[00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:34.800]   Abram stumbles.
[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:35.800]   Sarah stumbles.
[00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:36.800]   We can't. It's impossible.
[00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:37.800]   We don't understand.
[00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:38.800]   It doesn't matter.
[00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:39.800]   Here it is.
[00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:40.800]   It's going to happen.
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:41.800]   It shall happen.
[00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:42.800]   It did happen.
[00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:43.800]   It will happen.
[00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:47.800]   And in the fullness of the times Christ came.
[00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:49.800]   And the end will happen.
[00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:52.800]   Not your understanding and mine.
[00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:54.800]   The understanding of God.
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:56.800]   The mystery of God.
[00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:59.800]   And that brings me to my last point for this evening.
[00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:02.800]   What is the essence of this plan as put to Abram?
[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:04.800]   Well it's this.
[00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:08.800]   That God is preparing a people for Himself.
[00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:12.800]   He'd made the whole world and the whole world was His and all its peoples.
[00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:16.800]   But they've all sinned and they've all gone astray.
[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:19.800]   And they've fallen into heathendom and paganism.
[00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:22.800]   And things that are even worse.
[00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:24.800]   And what is God's way of redemption?
[00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:25.800]   Here it is.
[00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:28.800]   He's going to make a people for Himself.
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:31.800]   You see He has His eyes on that ultimate perfection.
[00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:35.800]   Where there shall be a new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness.
[00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:38.800]   And it's to be peopled with people.
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:40.800]   Where are they to come from?
[00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:42.800]   Now here's the secret of the covenant.
[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:46.800]   Here's the secret of God's great plan and purpose of redemption.
[00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:49.800]   He's going to make a people for Himself.
[00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:53.800]   Out of this mass of sunken sinful humanity.
[00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:57.800]   He's going to make a people for Himself.
[00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:00.800]   And this is the secret that He revealed to Abram.
[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:03.800]   He says I'm going to make a new people, a miraculous people.
[00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:08.800]   And it will start by the miracle of the birth of your son whom you are to call Isaac.
[00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:12.800]   And out of him there are to be others.
[00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:15.800]   Isaac begat Jacob and Jacob begat the twelve patriarchs.
[00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:16.800]   And on and on it goes.
[00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:18.800]   A nation, a people.
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:21.800]   Here's the great story of the Old Testament.
[00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:29.800]   Abram is the beginner, the father chosen by God for this new nation.
[00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:31.800]   What is God going to do through this people?
[00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:34.800]   Well this is what He did in the Old Testament.
[00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:37.800]   He told Abram His secret.
[00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:42.800]   And Abram passed it on to Isaac and Isaac passed it on to Jacob.
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:45.800]   They were frail creatures like we are, full of sin.
[00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:47.800]   But they've got the secret.
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:50.800]   And they lived in the light of this great secret.
[00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:54.800]   God's promise, God's covenant, God's great purpose.
[00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:57.800]   And He wants to teach the whole world through this nation.
[00:47:57.800 --> 00:47:59.800]   And He did so.
[00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:06.800]   He gave them laws, revealing Himself and His own holy nature and His ultimate purpose.
[00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:08.800]   He gave them teachers.
[00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:10.800]   They're different from the world, the other nations.
[00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:13.800]   They never had the law that was given through Moses.
[00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:16.800]   They didn't have a great line of prophetic teachers.
[00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:21.800]   No, they were sunken in the darkness of the iniquity of paganism.
[00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:23.800]   They remained, if you like, in a kind of Mesopotamia.
[00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:28.800]   Even the Greeks, the clever Greeks and the Romans, they were worshipping the deities.
[00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:30.800]   They had their pantheons.
[00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:35.800]   But this little nation, they have this mystic secret.
[00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:37.800]   God has let them into the secret.
[00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:43.800]   And God is to teach the whole world and to bless the whole world through these people.
[00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:46.800]   He has announced that He's a holy God.
[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:49.800]   He has said, "Be ye holy, for I am holy."
[00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:52.800]   The people must be like their God.
[00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:55.800]   And so He goes on instructing the world through them.
[00:48:55.800 --> 00:49:00.800]   And not only that, He instructed the world by what He did to them and what He did for them.
[00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:03.800]   I've already reminded you of what happened at the Red Sea.
[00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:05.800]   There was only one explanation.
[00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:07.800]   It was the God of these people.
[00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:09.800]   The same with crossing the Jordan.
[00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:11.800]   The same on many an occasion.
[00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:16.800]   When they beat those powerful enemies, the enemies came to this conclusion, "It's their God."
[00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:19.800]   They said, "Their God is greater than our gods."
[00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:21.800]   Who is this God of theirs?
[00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:28.800]   God's teaching them, revealing to the whole world something of the truth concerning Himself.
[00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:35.800]   But ultimately, the end and the object of producing this nation through Abraham
[00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:42.800]   was to prepare for the coming of His only begotten Son into this world of time.
[00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:47.800]   Here is the center of God's plan, God's purpose.
[00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:50.800]   He must send His only Son into the world.
[00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:54.800]   It's the only way whereby the world can be saved.
[00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:57.800]   The Word must be made flesh.
[00:49:57.800 --> 00:50:00.800]   It's no use making another Adam. He'll fail like the first Adam.
[00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:04.800]   God the Son must come down and take unto Him human nature.
[00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:06.800]   How is He to do it? Where is He to get it from?
[00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:08.800]   Listen to Paul putting it to the Romans.
[00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:12.800]   Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle,
[00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:14.800]   separated unto the gospel of God,
[00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:18.800]   which He had promised afore by His prophets in the Holy Scriptures,
[00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:22.800]   concerning His Son Jesus Christ our Lord,
[00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:27.800]   which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh,
[00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:32.800]   and declared to be the Son of God with power according to the spirit of holiness
[00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:34.800]   by the resurrection from the dead.
[00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:38.800]   But listen to him saying it again in the ninth chapter of the epistle to the Romans.
[00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:40.800]   It was so vital to Paul.
[00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:44.800]   He says he's got great heaviness and continual sorrow in his heart,
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:46.800]   for his fellow countrymen, the Jews,
[00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:48.800]   for I could wish, he says,
[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:51.800]   that myself were accursed from Christ,
[00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:54.800]   for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh,
[00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:56.800]   who are Israelites,
[00:50:56.800 --> 00:51:04.800]   to whom pertaineth the adoption and the glory and the covenants,
[00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:06.800]   the covenant made with Noah,
[00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:08.800]   the covenant made with Abraham,
[00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:12.800]   the covenant made with Isaac and Jacob and Moses and David,
[00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:16.800]   to whom pertaineth the adoption and the glory and the covenants
[00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:19.800]   and the giving of the law and the service of God
[00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:22.800]   and the promises whose are the fathers,
[00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:29.800]   and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came,
[00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:34.800]   who is over all God, blessed forever.
[00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:37.800]   God makes this nation out of Abraham
[00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:42.800]   in order that out of this may come this blessed Messiah.
[00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:48.800]   He was born a Jew of the seed of David according to the flesh.
[00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:52.800]   And it is through this person, this seed of Abraham,
[00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:55.800]   that all the nations of the world are to be blessed.
[00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:57.800]   One nation to start with,
[00:51:57.800 --> 00:52:02.800]   now out of all nations and tribes and languages and people,
[00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:07.800]   he'll gather them out and form this people for himself.
[00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:12.800]   This is the great center of this plan and purpose of redemption.
[00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:17.800]   The seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head.
[00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:23.800]   Or as our Lord put it, Abraham rejoiced to see my day.
[00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:26.800]   He saw it and was glad.
[00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:30.800]   This is one of the secrets that God told to Abraham.
[00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:33.800]   He told him of this which he was going to do.
[00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:36.800]   Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day.
[00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:40.800]   And he saw it and was glad.
[00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:46.800]   Way back 2,000 years before the birth of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:49.800]   God had told this man Abraham
[00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:53.800]   that out of his loins as it were, out of his seed,
[00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:59.800]   his own eternal son was going to be born according to the flesh.
[00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:02.800]   And it was in him and through him
[00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:06.800]   that all the nations of the earth are going to be blessed.
[00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:13.800]   All God's plans and purposes center in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:18.800]   All the promises of God are in him, yea, and in him, amen,
[00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:21.800]   to the glory of God the Father.
[00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:31.800]   God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself.
[00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:37.800]   That's what he told Abraham, the God of glory,
[00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:44.800]   appeared unto Abraham while he was yet in Mesopotamia.
[00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:49.800]   And he gave him a glimpse of the coming of his son
[00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:51.800]   on the cross on Calvary's hill.
[00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:53.800]   Abraham didn't understand it.
[00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:56.800]   A darkness came upon him, but he was given a glimpse.
[00:53:56.800 --> 00:54:00.800]   Abraham rejoiced to see my day.
[00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:03.800]   He saw it and was glad.
[00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:06.800]   God revealed it to him, gave him a glimpse of it.
[00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:09.800]   And this is the message of salvation.
[00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:14.800]   Oh, you members of the Sanhedrin, says Stephen in effect,
[00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:17.800]   why do you reject this person, can't you see?
[00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:20.800]   He's the fulfillment of all you claim to believe.
[00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:24.800]   He's the acme, the focus of God's eternal purpose.
[00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:27.800]   All the promises given to the Father and the covenants,
[00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:32.800]   here he is, the covenant person.
[00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:36.800]   And unless and except you believe in him,
[00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:43.800]   you remain in your sins, lost and without a hope.
[00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:50.800]   My dear friend, have you understood the message of the covenant?
[00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:53.800]   Have you known that God's way of saving you
[00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:58.800]   and saving the whole universe is in his only begotten Son,
[00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:03.800]   our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ?
[00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:05.800]   Can't you see it's all God?
[00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:08.800]   Don't try to understand. Don't be foolish.
[00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:12.800]   Don't damn your own soul with your useless confidence
[00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:19.800]   in your own ability to understand the mystery of God, the mystery.
[00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:22.800]   Before the very foundation of the world,
[00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:26.800]   ordained of God to our glory,
[00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:29.800]   in spite of the world, in spite of hell,
[00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:31.800]   in spite of what has happened, in spite of what is happening,
[00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:34.800]   in spite of what may happen,
[00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:39.800]   believe this message concerning the Son of God.
[00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:43.800]   Believe that he died for you and your sins and your guilt.
[00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:45.800]   Cast yourself upon him.
[00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:49.800]   Don't try to understand. You're not saved by it, I say.
[00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:52.800]   Just believe. Only believe.
[00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:59.800]   And thou shalt see that Christ is all in all to you.
[00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:02.800]   May God have mercy upon us.
[00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:05.800]   Bring us to the end of ourselves.
[00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:11.800]   And then open our eyes to the glory of his covenant
[00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:15.800]   and the mystery of his way of redemption.
[00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:19.800]   Amen.
