[00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.440]   - Let's go through all the things that you should do
[00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.860]   to make sure you're through security as fast as possible.
[00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.040]   And the first is just to check in
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:08.960]   before you get to the airport.
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.120]   - 1000%.
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.520]   We always check in 24 hours or sometimes 30 hours,
[00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:13.960]   depending on the airline, in advance
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.680]   to make sure that we have boarding passes in hand.
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.320]   We understand if our known traveler numbers
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.600]   or our fast track security or our premier access
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.280]   or whatever is showing on the boarding pass.
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.080]   And if it's not, that's the time to troubleshoot it.
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.540]   It's a day in advance.
[00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.940]   You definitely don't want to be at the airport
[00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.200]   with very little time to spend
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.620]   and you've got to wait into a line at the counter
[00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.900]   to talk to somebody to actually get a boarding pass.
[00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:34.740]   You're not doing it right.
[00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.480]   So check in 24 hours in advance.
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.120]   For some airlines like Southwest,
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.140]   that's almost a requirement, right?
[00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.660]   If you don't check in and get a better boarding pass,
[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.120]   you will be waiting in line in the back of the B's
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.000]   or the C's in a bad boarding position,
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.040]   which is never what you want.
