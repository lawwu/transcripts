[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:12.320]   Paul's epistle to the Galatians in the first chapter and the eighth verse.
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.760]   The eighth verse in the first chapter of Paul's epistle to the Galatians.
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.760]   "But though we are an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:30.960]   which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed."
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.600]   But though we are an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.240]   we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.160]   Then he repeats it in verse nine.
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:53.080]   "As we said before, so say I now again, if any man preach any other gospel unto you than
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:58.400]   that ye have received, let him be accursed."
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:10.360]   Now, we are trying to face together on these Sunday nights what is, of course, beyond any
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:18.360]   question the great problem of life for anybody who is alive at this moment, and that is the
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.160]   whole state and condition of the world in which we live.
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.960]   Its crisis, its trouble, its confusion.
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.440]   And the great question is, what is the cause of all this?
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.480]   What can be done about all this?
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:41.040]   We have been examining this and seen how men try to understand it and explain it and deal
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.480]   with it in different ways, but obviously everything that is being tried and has been tried is
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.080]   failing and is disappointing.
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.840]   And the world is in trouble, it is in agony.
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:00.400]   But—and this is our message as Christians—the astonishing thing above everything else is
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:09.400]   the way in which men and women persistently refuse to consider the message of this book.
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:14.880]   Our claim is that this and this alone explains the world and its condition, explains any
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:23.040]   one of us to ourselves, but still more important, this and this alone gives us any hope of deliverance
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.520]   and release and emancipation.
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.000]   And yet the world will not consider it.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.280]   And it has got many reasons for that.
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.280]   We have been examining them.
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.800]   I need not repeat them this evening.
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.400]   We have examined them one by one and seen when you do come to examine them that there
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.400]   is nothing there.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.640]   They are all based on fallacies.
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.440]   The view, for instance, that because this is an old book it cannot possibly deal with
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:53.240]   the situation today, we sought to be completely fallacious because the problem as dealt with
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.760]   in this book is identical with the problem of today.
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.560]   The idea that it has been tried and found wanting, we found again to be equally specious
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.800]   as an argument, equally false.
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.000]   The whole trouble is that it has not been tried.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.480]   And the world is tonight as it is because men and women will not try it, will not submit
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.040]   themselves to it and accept it and live according to its teaching.
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.200]   Very well.
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.520]   And then we have been coming on to some such things as this.
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:30.020]   The real trouble, I believe, in the last analysis is that the world knows, though it is so ignorant
[00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:36.600]   of the Bible, it knows by a kind of instinct that this book and its message runs entirely
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:43.880]   contrary to everything that they believe and to all that they hold dear.
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.400]   That is the real trouble.
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.360]   Man always wants to regard everything in general, but this book deals with it in a very personal
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.360]   way.
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.880]   Man is interested in the life of the body, the Bible is interested in the life of the
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:58.880]   soul.
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:06.840]   Man is full of self-confidence and of assurance, feels he has got the ability to deal with
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.800]   the situation, he does not need God, he is competent.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:17.520]   And the Bible shows him very clearly the utter fallacy of all this.
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:22.560]   We were looking at it last Sunday night and we saw that when a man really faces himself
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:28.760]   and faces his own life, he is aware that there are forces within him that are stronger than
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:29.760]   himself.
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.480]   No man would ever be miserable from remorse if that were not true.
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:40.680]   We all know that there are forces in us, stronger than our reason, stronger than our wills.
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.960]   We keep on doing things though they hurt us, though we are sorry afterwards, we go back
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:45.960]   and back.
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:46.960]   Why?
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.600]   Well, we are mastered by forces in our bodies, in our members, lusts, movements, passions,
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.360]   instincts, drives that are beyond us.
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.920]   And we are confronted by the whole mind and outlook of the world, which is stronger than
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.280]   us, and we are carried away by the stream.
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.520]   And man is incapable of standing.
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:11.480]   Now though we see all this, still the modern man refuses to admit it.
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.640]   That's the essential cause of the trouble.
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:19.360]   But there he is, and he is visibly failing.
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.320]   That's the whole tragedy of the world this evening.
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:29.160]   And it's not only failing as a world, man is failing as an individual.
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.220]   Now then the question that arises at this point is this.
[00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.760]   What then is he to do?
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.280]   If we have gone by step from step to step in a logical manner, and have arrived at this
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:48.400]   point in which we see man in utter helplessness, failing to master himself, failing to deal
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.840]   with his world.
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.540]   What is he to do?
[00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:56.200]   What is he to do in this helpless condition, where he sees himself as helpless as a little
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.160]   child?
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.320]   And here comes the answer of this book once more.
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.560]   The one thing therefore that he should do is this.
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.080]   He should admit his failure.
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.560]   He should acknowledge his inability.
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.080]   He should say, "I don't understand.
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.080]   I've tried the philosophies, they don't explain.
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.120]   I've tried willpower, I've tried doing all I'm told, but I can't do it."
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.760]   Very well then, he should admit and confess it all.
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:28.240]   He should acknowledge that he is indeed as a little child.
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:34.240]   And then admitting and confessing that, the next thing obviously for him to do is this.
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.200]   Is to be prepared to listen to this message.
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.920]   Now we've got to go through these steps in stages.
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:46.240]   It is only the man who becomes bankrupt who's ready to listen to true advice.
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.320]   As long as he thinks he can deal with it, he won't listen.
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:55.960]   But having seen his utter bankruptcy, he then should be in a position to listen and say,
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.960]   "Well, I've tried and I've failed.
[00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:58.960]   What have you got to say?"
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.680]   And what I have to say is this.
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:09.520]   That here is a message offering you all you need and infinitely more.
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.980]   Isn't this a logical step?
[00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:15.160]   Isn't this a point at which reason ought to bring us?
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:19.840]   But having seen our utter inability and failure, well then we should listen to this.
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.280]   We should submit to it.
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:30.120]   But now when we come to this point, the modern man retorts and he replies to us by saying
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:33.280]   something like this.
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:37.000]   He says, "Yes, but what is your message?
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.560]   How may I know what your message is?
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:43.280]   And how may I know that that message is true?"
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:49.160]   Now this is what they actually are saying and that is why I am dealing with it.
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:53.200]   I have no doubt at all, but that there are people in this congregation at this moment
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.720]   who are not Christians for this very reason.
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:59.160]   They say, "What is Christianity?
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.640]   What is your message?
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:06.800]   How can I be sure that it is really the message of salvation?"
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.560]   Now that's a perfectly fair question.
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:14.320]   In other words, at this point we come face to face quite inevitably with the whole question
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:15.320]   of authority.
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.320]   Authority.
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:22.720]   Man says that he has listened to various vices and he is tired of listening to them.
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.120]   So many have stopped even listening.
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.400]   So many don't read, they don't think.
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:30.400]   They say there is only one wise thing to do in a world like this.
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.480]   Make the best of it as you can.
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:34.480]   Get on with it.
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:35.480]   Get the maximum out of life.
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.080]   It's no use listening.
[00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:40.440]   These people have been talking, this one says this and that one says that.
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.640]   Who am I to understand?
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:43.480]   And he gives up.
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.200]   Let us eat, drink and be merry.
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.440]   If the bombs are to go off, well they'll go off.
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:49.440]   There it is.
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:52.400]   Let us eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die.
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:58.420]   And in utter confusion they've stopped thinking, stopped listening, stopped even hoping that
[00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:01.880]   there is a word which can bring salvation.
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:05.840]   It's the question of authority.
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:12.920]   And I'm very ready to admit and to grant from this Christian pulpit that there is at this
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:18.840]   point perhaps the greatest confusion of all.
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:25.120]   I make this admission with the bitterest regret, but to be honest and to be helpful, I have
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.360]   got to make the admission.
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:32.640]   I have great sympathy with the modern man who says, "What am I to believe?
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:36.000]   What is the message of Christianity?"
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.640]   Why am I such sympathy with him?
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:42.920]   Well, because I say he really is being presented with something which can only be described
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:47.400]   by the word "confusion."
[00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:53.400]   All sorts and kinds of things are being said in the name of Christianity and in the name
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.640]   of the Christian Church.
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:59.640]   And there on the street is the bewildered modern man who sees what the world is coming
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.960]   to and knows his own failure, and he says, "What am I to believe of all this?
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:04.960]   Which is it?"
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:10.560]   Now let me illustrate what I mean.
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:19.400]   A learned journal in its current number, the Autumn Number, of a well-known periodical
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:25.440]   journal known as the Twentieth Century, it's devoted this issue, the current issue, almost
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:31.920]   entirely to this question of religion and of God.
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:33.800]   And there are some extraordinary statements in it.
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:34.800]   Let me quote one of them.
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:35.800]   Here is one.
[00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:41.120]   "Even though," says the writer, "well over ninety percent of the population believe in
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:50.080]   God, an increasing number are less definite about his actual character and demands.
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:56.800]   Doctrine has become quite insignificant, and a large number of believers are more than
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:05.280]   vague over even central matters such as the Trinity, the soul, and the afterlife."
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:10.200]   Now, I'm sorry to say it, but I've got to agree with him.
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:14.880]   I think that is an actual, simple statement of fact.
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:21.080]   That is, the position with an increasing number, doctrine has become quite insignificant, and
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:25.520]   a large number of believers are more than vague on even central matters such as the
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:30.440]   Trinity, the soul, and the afterlife.
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.880]   Now there's no doubt about this at all.
[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:40.440]   The world is being confronted by contradictory vices on such central matters as the one which
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:43.600]   this writer indicates.
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:51.560]   Belief in the three persons in the blessed Holy Trinity, the triune God, Father, Son,
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:52.560]   Holy Spirit.
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:53.560]   Great confusion.
[00:11:53.560 --> 00:12:01.240]   There are denials concerning the God of the Old Testament, as they call it, even from
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:02.240]   Christian pulpits.
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:06.920]   There are men in the name of Christianity saying they no longer believe in the God of
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:12.800]   the Old Testament, whom they regard as a tribal God, and say they couldn't possibly worship
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:13.800]   him.
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:17.560]   That kind of thing is being said to the modern men.
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:22.520]   Statements concerning our Lord himself, even in connection with his birth at this season
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:23.520]   of Advent.
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:28.040]   They still go on talking about Advent, but they don't believe in the virgin birth.
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:33.240]   Many of them don't believe even in his deity, yet they do it in the name of Christianity.
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:36.760]   They don't believe his miracles, they reject them in total.
[00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:41.360]   They say miracles don't happen and haven't happened, and all this is just a bit of magic
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:45.480]   that came in from the minds of a primitive people at that time.
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:48.080]   They don't believe, I say, in that.
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:50.680]   They certainly don't believe in his atoning death.
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:54.280]   They ridicule a preaching of the blood of Christ.
[00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:59.000]   They pour scorn and derision upon it, and they say they don't believe that.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.800]   It was just the death of a martyr, the death of an honest man.
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:06.600]   Most of them say it was the greatest tragedy that the world has ever known.
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:10.600]   It was a sort of repetition of the death of Socrates.
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:15.240]   They don't believe in his literal physical resurrection.
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:21.560]   They deny it, they dispute it, and if they believe at all in an afterlife, their ideas
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:22.880]   are very vague.
[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:28.600]   They certainly don't believe in the personal bodily visible return into this world of the
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:30.160]   Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:36.920]   They dismiss it as belonging to the realm of folklore and of magic.
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:40.680]   Well, these are the difficulties of the modern man.
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:43.280]   He says, "You tell me to come and believe your gospel.
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:47.160]   You invite me to become a Christian, but what is Christianity?
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:48.840]   This is what I'm confronted with.
[00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:49.840]   What am I to say?"
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:53.960]   Now, unfortunately, the denial doesn't stop even at things like that.
[00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:57.640]   The crucial point in many ways is this.
[00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.000]   What is salvation?
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.800]   How is one to become a Christian?
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:04.800]   That's the question.
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:12.320]   And here there is equal confusion, because the world is confronted by a statement like
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:18.440]   the one I'm about to quote to you from a most important dignitary in the Christian
[00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:25.440]   Church, who in an interview with the Daily Press makes this statement, "Heaven is also
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:30.440]   not a place to which we humans go in our present bodily state."
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:31.440]   That's all right.
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:38.480]   But then he goes on to say this, "Nor is it a place for Christians only.
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:45.680]   Those who have led a good life on earth but found themselves unable to believe in God
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:48.640]   will not be debarred from heaven.
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:53.040]   I expect to meet some present-day atheists there."
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:59.000]   Now, here is the modern man, I say, in utter confusion on the street.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.640]   He's prepared to agree with me when I say that he and the men he's followed don't seem
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:04.880]   to understand.
[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:05.880]   He's tried the philosophers.
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:07.440]   They don't help him.
[00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:11.520]   He's believed in science and evolution, but it doesn't seem to be working the right way.
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:14.600]   It seems to be going backwards instead of forwards.
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:17.960]   All the things he's tried have led him to nothing and to nowhere.
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:22.880]   So at last, in bewilderment, he sees this great institution, the Christian Church.
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:25.520]   She's been going for nearly 2,000 years.
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:28.520]   She says, "I wonder whether this has got the answer after all."
[00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:30.520]   And he comes and he begins to listen.
[00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:37.320]   But at once he's confronted by this terrible confusion, statements even to the effect that
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:43.440]   heaven is not confined to Christians only, that we can expect to find in heaven men who
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:46.840]   don't even believe in God.
[00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:52.360]   But they'll be there because they've lived good lives here on earth.
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:59.520]   Now, what do we say to this?
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:01.920]   I want to try to answer that question.
[00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:10.680]   And God knows, let me say again, I'm not dealing with this in any spirit of controversy.
[00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:16.120]   The times are too desperate for mere controversy.
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:25.520]   I'm doing what I'm doing tonight with a broken heart, with a sense of tragedy.
[00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:28.560]   I have only one reason for doing it.
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:32.800]   And that is, my dear friend, if you are listening to me as I believe you are tonight, who are
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:39.900]   in this confusion, that I am concerned about your immortal soul.
[00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:42.760]   Nothing else would persuade me to do this.
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:44.800]   But it's got to be done.
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:49.560]   There are men outside the kingdom of God because they're being confused by this pable of teaching.
[00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:51.480]   They say, "Well, I like to believe.
[00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:52.960]   Which is Christianity?
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:55.680]   How can I know which is true Christianity?"
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:17:01.400]   I say it is incumbent upon us to face this and to face it honestly.
[00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:05.720]   And I'm going to do so in the light of this tremendous statement which the Apostle makes
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:09.920]   here in this first chapter of his epistle to the Galatians.
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:13.760]   And what I've got to say therefore is this, that there's nothing new about this modern
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:14.760]   position.
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:18.400]   It's a very old one, unfortunately.
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:21.800]   That's the very question that the Apostle deals with here.
[00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:24.480]   There was already trouble even in the early church.
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:29.040]   The Apostle has to write this very severe letter because there were other people, he
[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:30.040]   says.
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:33.800]   He says, "I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:37.120]   Christ and to another gospel, which is not another."
[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:42.840]   But he says, "There be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of Christ."
[00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:46.720]   They were doing it in the early centuries, in the early church.
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:51.000]   Alas, the devil has been trying to do this from the very beginning.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.880]   And it's not surprising, of course.
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:54.920]   This is the message of the Son of God.
[00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:56.600]   This is God's own message.
[00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:59.360]   And the devil comes in and he causes confusion.
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:01.680]   He causes people to think it's this or that.
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:03.520]   And in the end they don't know where they are.
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:09.520]   And so the devil is triumphant and God's cause is, as it were, suffering a kind of
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:10.520]   temporary defeat.
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:13.600]   That's why the world is as it is tonight.
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:15.840]   And that is why we've got to deal with this matter.
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:19.200]   Now, how did the Apostle deal with it?
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:22.080]   Well you notice his method.
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:24.360]   He denounces it.
[00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:28.760]   He denounces it in very strong language.
[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:30.720]   He anathematizes it.
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:35.280]   "Though we are an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which
[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:40.120]   we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.
[00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:45.520]   May the curse of God," says the Apostle, "come down upon him and upon his life.
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:46.520]   May he be cursed."
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:49.520]   It's a terrible statement to make.
[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:51.840]   He repeats it.
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:53.200]   He denounces it.
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:54.680]   He anathematizes it.
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:55.680]   Why?
[00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:59.200]   Well, he says it isn't a gospel.
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:03.840]   And then he goes on to say that there's only one gospel, and the one gospel is the
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:05.520]   one that he had preached.
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.240]   Let me repeat it to you.
[00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:11.560]   "Though we are an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which
[00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:14.560]   we have preached unto you, let him be accursed."
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:15.560]   He's saying virtually this.
[00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:18.920]   He says, "Let any man," I don't care whether he calls himself a Christian or an
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:24.440]   Apostle or whatever he may call himself, "Indeed, even if an angel from heaven preaches any
[00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:29.640]   other gospel unto you than the one which I preached unto you, let him be accursed."
[00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:34.680]   Now, what he's saying there, of course, is that there's only one gospel.
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:40.880]   And the one gospel is the gospel that he himself had preached to these Galatians.
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:47.840]   "Ah, yes," says someone, "that's, of course, something that I can easily understand."
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:53.680]   Isn't that just a very typical bit of the arrogance of this Apostle Paul?
[00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:57.400]   Turns to a man saying, "I alone am right.
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:59.400]   Everybody else wrong."
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.720]   And if a man doesn't preach what I've preached, he's wrong.
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:05.320]   "I alone am right," and I pronounce an anathema upon him.
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:08.680]   Isn't that just his colossal conceit?
[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:15.160]   Isn't just that the arrogance and the intolerance of this pharisaical Jew who had become a Christian
[00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:17.360]   – he's still more of a Pharisee than a Christian.
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:19.400]   He says, "If you don't say what I say, you're wrong.
[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:21.240]   If you don't believe what I believe, you're wrong.
[00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:22.680]   I alone am right."
[00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:24.200]   Isn't that what's being said?
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.200]   Well, it is.
[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:31.800]   And as I'm trying to remind you, unfortunately, it's being said from Christian pulpits.
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:38.760]   I read a sermon not long ago in which a man said he looked forward, when he got to heaven,
[00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:42.440]   to the opportunity of putting the Apostle Paul right on certain matters which he'd
[00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:43.440]   written in his letters.
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:44.440]   That's it.
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:45.440]   That's the attitude.
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:53.120]   You see, Paul was wrong on these matters because he was a Jew, ex-Pharisee, and so on and so
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:54.120]   forth.
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:58.360]   Well, no, though, that's the Apostle's way of dealing with it.
[00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:01.200]   That's the charge that's brought against him.
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:03.240]   How does he answer it?
[00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:08.700]   How does he justify the use of this strong language?
[00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:14.240]   How does he venture to say that if a man preaches any other gospel than that which we have preached
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:18.640]   unto you, let him be accursed?
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:22.080]   How does he dare say such a thing?
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:24.560]   He gives us his answers.
[00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:30.520]   And all I want to do tonight is to repeat his answers, because I have no answer apart
[00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:33.600]   from the answer of this Apostle.
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:40.960]   The only Christianity that I know is the Christianity that is based upon the teaching of the Apostles.
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:45.360]   The Church is founded upon the Apostles and the Prophets.
[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:49.580]   I know nothing apart from this Apostolic teaching.
[00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:51.340]   This is my only message.
[00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:53.080]   This is my only authority.
[00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:54.720]   So I can but repeat it.
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:59.680]   And I am here asserting that what the Apostle said to his traducers and his critics in his
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:05.440]   own day is the same that has to be said to these people tonight, whoever they are, whatever
[00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:07.960]   great their name and their position.
[00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:13.720]   Well, unfortunately, this is not confined to any one section of the Church or any one
[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:14.720]   denomination.
[00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:15.920]   It is true of them all.
[00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:20.440]   You get this kind of teaching running right through everywhere.
[00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:21.760]   Very well, what is the answer?
[00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:24.640]   Well, let us notice what he says.
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:28.840]   Why does he anathematize this teaching?
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:33.320]   His first reply is that it has got no authority.
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:37.120]   It is based on no authority.
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:42.640]   What he means by that is that it is based on nothing but the authority of men.
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:43.640]   Did you notice?
[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:44.640]   He is full of matter.
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:45.640]   He is full of this thing.
[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:50.400]   The Apostle was really moved when this report came to him of this other Gospel which was
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:53.120]   not a Gospel which was being preached in Galatia.
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:57.760]   You see, he normally, you who know his epistles will have noticed this, whenever he writes
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:00.400]   a letter he always starts quietly and slowly.
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:04.080]   He has a preliminary salutation and he sends them greetings and so on.
[00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:05.080]   Not a bit of it here.
[00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:11.440]   He starts off at once, "Paul, an Apostle in brackets, not of men, neither by men."
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:15.280]   But by Jesus Christ he has already started on the argument.
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:18.840]   He is concerned about the whole question of authority.
[00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:21.200]   And it is the most vital question of all.
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:24.200]   If a man does not know what to believe, how can he believe it?
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:28.000]   How can a man be saved if he does not know what to put his faith in?
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.420]   This authority is absolutely essential.
[00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:36.960]   And what he says about this other thing is, "It's got no authority.
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:40.320]   It is of men only."
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:45.680]   He says, "Mine is not only of men, but theirs is only of men."
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:47.600]   He says, "They're simply teaching their own ideas.
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:50.840]   They're simply giving you their own opinions."
[00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:55.680]   And he contrasts that with the way in which he preaches and the message which he preaches.
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:24:00.080]   Well now, this is equally true at the present time.
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:07.580]   Take that statement, for instance, that heaven is not going to be confined to Christians,
[00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:12.320]   that men who don't believe in God at all, men who are atheists, if they live good lives,
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:13.320]   will get to heaven.
[00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:19.040]   All I want to ask is this, who told you so?
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:23.000]   On what authority is that kind of statement made?
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.760]   That's the question.
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:30.040]   When a man says with authority that what saves a man is the living of a good life, I ask,
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:33.400]   where is his authority for saying that in the name of Christ?
[00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:36.560]   And there's only one answer.
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:41.840]   He has no authority whatsoever.
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:52.040]   It is a statement which is based only upon human reason, human opinion.
[00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:57.000]   And that is the tragedy of the present hour, that so much of what passes as Christianity
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:03.960]   is based solely upon human opinion and upon human reason.
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:12.440]   Its ultimate test, its ultimate standard is always modern knowledge and modern discovery,
[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:14.640]   and especially scientific discovery.
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:18.560]   Of course, they say, "We can't believe the Bible as people used to believe it from cover
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:19.560]   to cover.
[00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:22.360]   We can't accept all that it says because we know.
[00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:25.000]   We've discovered this, science has shown this and that."
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   Isn't that the argument?
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.280]   Well, now, what does that mean?
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:33.080]   Well, it means that their ultimate authority is knowledge, human knowledge, human development,
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:37.920]   human advance, human discovery, human science.
[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:41.360]   This becomes the ultimate test.
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:43.440]   This becomes the ultimate authority.
[00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:45.560]   This becomes the ultimate sanction.
[00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:48.240]   And then, of course, they employ their reason on all this.
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:53.920]   They say they cannot think of or imagine a God of love excluding anybody from heaven,
[00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:56.560]   and therefore they say that he doesn't do so.
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:26:00.040]   They say, "Indeed, a man may not actually come to believe in God in this world.
[00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:01.680]   It doesn't matter.
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:05.940]   God will reveal it to him sometime later at some other point.
[00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:07.760]   You mustn't say that he's excluded."
[00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:08.800]   No, no.
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:10.960]   But what is their authority for this?
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:13.120]   Nothing whatsoever but their own opinion.
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:14.360]   That's what they think.
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:18.720]   That's what they think it ought to be, and because they think it ought to be, they dogmatically
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:23.440]   assert that it is the truth, that it is indeed a fact.
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:30.200]   We find that men are making statements today that are diametrically opposed to the plain
[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:32.880]   teaching of the Bible.
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:35.800]   There's no question about this.
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:41.200]   These statements about God and his character, they say they can't believe in a God of wrath.
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:43.560]   They say it's inconceivable.
[00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:47.240]   They say you can't reconcile love and wrath, and because they can't in their philosophy
[00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:49.680]   reconcile them, they exclude the wrath.
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:52.960]   Well, now, this is purely a question of fact, my friends.
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:55.640]   This is a question of testing evidence.
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:27:03.720]   The Bible teaches that God is a God of wrath, that he is a holy God, that he manifested
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:09.680]   himself on Mount Sinai and said that he would punish sin, that he has a holy wrath against
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:10.720]   sin and evil.
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:12.120]   They say we don't believe that.
[00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:16.920]   Yes, but you see, in saying that, they're saying that they don't agree with the Lord
[00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:22.520]   Jesus Christ, whom they claim to believe in, because he believed the whole of the Old Testament.
[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:24.680]   He accepted it in total.
[00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:30.120]   And here is one of his apostles, one of his chosen selected men and representatives, this
[00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:36.640]   apostle Paul, he says that he preaches the gospel for this reason, that the wrath of
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:43.920]   God from heaven is already revealed upon all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men that
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:46.800]   hold down the truth in unrighteousness.
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:52.080]   It's nothing but a sheer contradiction of the biblical teaching and the teaching of
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:28:00.000]   the Son of God himself with regard to the very character and person and being of God.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.360]   It's the same with the whole attitude to the Old Testament.
[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:06.200]   They say they don't believe much of it.
[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:10.880]   There are bits of it they like, they reject the rest in total, but the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:13.000]   believed it all.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.760]   So you see, you're up against this whole question of who knows more, modern men with
[00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:20.440]   his learning or the Son of God, Jesus Christ of Nazareth.
[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:24.840]   It's a simple question of one or the other.
[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:30.360]   And it's exactly the same, of course, with all these disputes about his person and about
[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:32.200]   his work.
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:37.320]   There's no question at all but that the New Testament teaches that he is the Son of God
[00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:40.220]   and that he was born in that way of the Virgin.
[00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:41.760]   There's no question about these matters.
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:45.680]   They occur on the very surface.
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:49.040]   Heaven and hell, isn't it plain in the scriptures?
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:55.200]   Can a man honestly read this book and say that the Bible doesn't teach heaven and hell?
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:58.320]   And that a man spends his eternity in one or the other?
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:02.760]   Is there any question or dispute as to what the Bible teaches with regard to the way of
[00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:03.760]   salvation?
[00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:11.480]   Yet these men put their own knowledge and their own opinions and their own reason and
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:15.920]   their own understanding against this.
[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:19.160]   And they oppose it and they don't hesitate to say that this is wrong.
[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:22.960]   They even say that Jesus Christ was wrong because he was a child of his age.
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:24.600]   He didn't know as much as we do.
[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:25.880]   We are in a superior position.
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:29.480]   We can look down upon him and say, and correct him here and there.
[00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:40.960]   Now my friends, that's the first reason why the apostle uses such strong language.
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:47.960]   In terms of their own knowledge and advance and discoveries, there are men in the name
[00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:52.760]   of the Christian Church modifying the teaching of this book.
[00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:57.920]   One other article in this same journal from which I've quoted is able to prove that quite
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:03.400]   easily how parallel with the development of knowledge and especially of science, the Christian
[00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:08.280]   Church has been modifying and changing her doctrine lest it be an offence to this modern
[00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:10.300]   learning and to this modern man.
[00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:17.480]   And it's turned it into something that is finally a denial of the teaching of the Bible.
[00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:22.920]   Is it surprising that the apostle says that anybody who does that should be cursed?
[00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:24.360]   He must be cursed.
[00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:25.360]   Why?
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:27.760]   Because he's blasphemous.
[00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:32.920]   Because he's arrogantly putting himself up against the Almighty God and his Son.
[00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:35.360]   It is blasphemy.
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:41.200]   It is to contradict the plain revelation of God's Word.
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:43.420]   And to me that is nothing but blasphemy.
[00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:44.940]   That's what the apostle means.
[00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:46.900]   It's his language, it isn't mine.
[00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:50.520]   He says though we are an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that
[00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:54.080]   which we have preached, let him be accursed.
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:57.580]   He doesn't merely say the man's wrong, the man's making a mistake, the man ought to be
[00:30:57.580 --> 00:30:58.580]   silenced.
[00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:02.820]   He says this man is to be cursed.
[00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:05.900]   It isn't merely that the man's making a genuine mistake.
[00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:09.940]   It isn't that the man is just not managing to understand fully.
[00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:15.380]   He's making a pronouncement and he doesn't hesitate to correct the revelation of God.
[00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:18.300]   Now that I say is blasphemy.
[00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:23.300]   And there's only one treatment for blasphemy and that is to be cursed.
[00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:28.660]   Now that's why the apostle in the first instance speaks in this manner.
[00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:31.620]   This other teaching he says has no authority.
[00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:33.820]   Well what of his teaching?
[00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:36.780]   Isn't it just one man up against another?
[00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:39.940]   Isn't the teaching of this other man as good as the teaching of Paul?
[00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:42.940]   Who is Paul that he should set himself up as an authority?
[00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:47.220]   Who is any man who repeats Paul that he should say that he alone is right and that all these
[00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:48.220]   others are wrong?
[00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:49.220]   Isn't this sheer arrogance?
[00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:50.220]   No, no, says Paul.
[00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:55.780]   Paul says I'm not setting myself up.
[00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:59.500]   I'm not pitting my opinion against the opinion of these other teachers.
[00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:08.900]   I am an apostle, not of men, neither by men, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father who
[00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:10.980]   raised him up from the dead.
[00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:12.700]   Listen to him as he goes on.
[00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:16.100]   He says do you think I'm trying to persuade men or God?
[00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:17.820]   Do I now persuade men or God?
[00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:20.220]   Or do I seek to please men?
[00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:24.020]   He says for if I yet pleased men I should not be the servant of Christ.
[00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:25.020]   Then listen.
[00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:27.100]   He says I certify you brethren.
[00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:28.780]   I'm guaranteeing this to you.
[00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:31.140]   I'm speaking honestly before God.
[00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:37.980]   I certify you that the gospel which was preached of me is not after men.
[00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:43.380]   For I neither received it of a man, neither was I taught it by a man, neither have I thought
[00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:52.700]   it out myself, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:55.460]   And then he goes on to tell them his life story.
[00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:59.180]   He reminds them of this which is so true in his autobiography.
[00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:03.420]   He says you have heard of my conversation, you've heard of my manner of life in times
[00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:05.700]   past when I was in the Jews' religion.
[00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:09.980]   How that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God and wasted it.
[00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:14.580]   And I profited in the Jews' religion above many men equals in mine own nation, being
[00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:18.700]   more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.
[00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:20.500]   He says listen to me.
[00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:22.900]   I haven't arrived at this myself.
[00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:27.820]   He says I was a Pharisee and I was an expert and a particularly zealous Pharisee.
[00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:33.220]   I hated Christ, I hated his gospel, I believed it was anathema and I said so.
[00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:37.140]   I blasphemed his name and I'd be doing that now.
[00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:42.820]   But for one thing was that I changed my opinion not at all.
[00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:50.380]   But when it pleased God who separated me from my mother's womb and pulled me by his grace
[00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:55.760]   to reveal his son in me that I might preach him among the heathen, immediately I conferred
[00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:58.500]   not with flesh and blood and so on.
[00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:02.700]   Now what he's saying you see is this.
[00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:10.820]   That he speaks so confidently and with such assurance about his message because it was
[00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:15.820]   a message that had been given him directly by the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:20.940]   He isn't the man who sat down and worked out a theory.
[00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:24.340]   He isn't the man who's arrived as the result of study at these conclusions.
[00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:25.740]   No, no.
[00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:28.820]   All his study had led him to reject it.
[00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:32.020]   But on the road to Damascus the Son of God appeared to him.
[00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:33.700]   He saw him.
[00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:38.340]   He received it by direct revelation from the Son of God.
[00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:43.420]   It was Christ himself who gave him the message and taught him and told him what to say.
[00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:46.540]   You remember he called him and said, "You've got to be a minister and a witness to the
[00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:47.540]   people."
[00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:49.380]   "Here," says Paul, "it isn't mine.
[00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:52.980]   I'm not arguing on my own understanding against these men.
[00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:56.620]   It's what Christ has given me and I dare not preach any other.
[00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:57.780]   There is no other.
[00:34:57.780 --> 00:34:59.740]   It's Christ's own word.
[00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:02.780]   Here's his authority."
[00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:07.380]   So it isn't one man's opinion against another.
[00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:14.060]   It is the revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ as over against the opinions and the philosophies
[00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:18.820]   and the knowledge and the reasonings of men.
[00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:22.980]   My dear friend, had you understood that?
[00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:27.740]   Had you understood that the reason for saying that this and this alone is the gospel is
[00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:34.660]   that it is the one that has been revealed and explained by the very Son of God himself?
[00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:43.100]   And let me remind you, this gospel that was preached by this apostle Paul was preached
[00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:47.060]   also by all the other apostles.
[00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:48.060]   There was no difference.
[00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:52.740]   You can't land it on Paul and say, "This is the arrogant soul of Tarsus."
[00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:53.740]   No, no.
[00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:56.860]   What he preached, every one of the apostles preached.
[00:35:56.860 --> 00:36:00.180]   When he went up, as he'll tell you in the second chapter, and explained what he had
[00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:02.460]   been preaching, they said, "Perfectly right.
[00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:04.260]   That's exactly what we preach."
[00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:07.980]   He didn't get it from them, but when he told them what he was preaching, they said, "That's
[00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:10.300]   the very thing we preach ourselves."
[00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:14.260]   These others had been disciples of the Lord, do you remember, during the three years?
[00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:15.260]   He wasn't.
[00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:16.260]   He was outside.
[00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:17.900]   He's a man born out of due time.
[00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:20.620]   But Christ had taught them and revealed and given it to them.
[00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:22.740]   They were with him after his resurrection.
[00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:25.060]   And he expanded the scriptures and explained.
[00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:26.820]   They'd got it directly from Christ.
[00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:28.660]   Here they hear of this other man.
[00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:30.300]   Where's he got it from?
[00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:32.660]   And at first they were doubtful and suspicious of him.
[00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:34.860]   He went up and he said, "This is what I preach."
[00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:37.620]   They said, "That's exactly what we preach ourselves."
[00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:42.860]   The same Lord who delivered it to them before the ascension had delivered it to him after
[00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:43.860]   the ascension.
[00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:48.340]   In heaven he'd looked down upon him and had given him the identical message that he'd
[00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:49.700]   given to all the others.
[00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:51.340]   It's the same message.
[00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:54.500]   Not only Paul, but all the other apostles.
[00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:58.580]   They're unanimous in their teaching in this New Testament.
[00:36:58.580 --> 00:37:01.940]   Very well, my friend.
[00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:04.940]   What are you basing your belief upon?
[00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:07.100]   What's your authority?
[00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:09.620]   What's your sanction for what you believe?
[00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:13.900]   Is it the message of the Son of God through these apostles?
[00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:15.540]   Or is it some modern opinion?
[00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:18.260]   What a man gets up and says with great authority.
[00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:22.380]   I say that though a man hasn't come to believe in God in this life, if he's lived a good
[00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:25.140]   life he'll yet be found in heaven.
[00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:27.900]   How do you know?
[00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:28.900]   What evidence have you got?
[00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:29.900]   What authority have you got?
[00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:32.100]   You've got none.
[00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:35.380]   It's just the passing opinion of one man.
[00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:40.220]   There are many who agree with him, but that still is the opposite and the antithesis of
[00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:45.220]   the apostolic message, this revelation which is given by Jesus Christ.
[00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:47.100]   Very well, there's his first reason.
[00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:50.900]   Let me hurry to the second.
[00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:58.620]   His second reason for rejecting it and anathematizing it is this, is that it's not a gospel.
[00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:04.300]   I marvel that he has so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ
[00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:10.540]   unto another gospel which is not another.
[00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:13.100]   It's not another gospel.
[00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:14.100]   What's he mean?
[00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:18.740]   Well, he says it's offered to you as a gospel.
[00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:21.440]   It comes in the guise of a gospel.
[00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:23.180]   It says it's Christianity.
[00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:25.020]   These false teachers were doing that.
[00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:27.980]   They appeared amongst these Galatians as Christian teachers.
[00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:29.940]   They said we are preachers as Paul is.
[00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:31.900]   We are also Christians as he is.
[00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:35.540]   We are deliverers of the message of the Christ as the apostle Paul is.
[00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:37.460]   They said they've got a gospel.
[00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:39.980]   He says it isn't a gospel.
[00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:42.660]   He means this, there's no good news in it.
[00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:45.380]   A gospel is good news.
[00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:47.900]   And he says there's no good news in what they are preaching.
[00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:48.900]   What were they preaching?
[00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:51.540]   Well, you see, what they were preaching was this.
[00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:56.740]   Paul had said all you do is to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, justification by faith
[00:38:56.740 --> 00:39:01.980]   only, not your works, not your good deeds, nothing that you do at all, just as you are
[00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:06.660]   whether you are Jew or Gentile, believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you are saved.
[00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:09.060]   No, no, said these others.
[00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:13.180]   If you want to be saved and to be a true Christian, you've got to be circumcised.
[00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:15.100]   You've got to become a Jew as it were.
[00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:18.380]   And if you don't become circumcised, you're not saved.
[00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:24.580]   Christ plus circumcision and certain other elements of the law.
[00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:30.420]   Now then, says the apostle, I anathematize it because it's not a gospel.
[00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:32.420]   Another gospel which is yet not another.
[00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:34.740]   There's no good news there.
[00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:36.380]   It's a denial of the gospel.
[00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:38.380]   There's nothing new about it.
[00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:41.740]   He says, you know, there's no difference between that and the Old Testament law.
[00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:43.540]   They're taking you back to the law.
[00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:46.700]   They're taking you back under Moses and under the bondage of the law.
[00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:50.260]   There's nothing new.
[00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:57.500]   And I want to say the same about these modern gospels which are not a gospel.
[00:39:57.500 --> 00:40:01.960]   There is no difference between them and Greek philosophy.
[00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:02.960]   You study them.
[00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:03.960]   You look at them.
[00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:05.460]   I challenge you.
[00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:08.380]   You take what passes as Christian gospel today.
[00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:11.780]   I ask you, what is the difference between it and Greek philosophy?
[00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:16.540]   Here's a teaching that says, though a man denies all the doctrines of the faith, if
[00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:19.620]   he lives a good life, he'll be all right at the end.
[00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:22.460]   Greek philosophy taught the same thing.
[00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:26.660]   Not only Greek philosophy taught it, modern humanism teaches it.
[00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:29.980]   There are men who say quite openly that they are not Christians.
[00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:33.100]   I honor them for their honesty.
[00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:35.460]   When a man isn't a Christian, let him say so.
[00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:38.660]   That's very much better than a man who says, "I'm a Christian," and then twists it into
[00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:40.220]   something that isn't Christianity.
[00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:42.140]   Here are these modern men.
[00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:45.180]   They call themselves, some of them, classical humanists.
[00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:47.380]   Others call themselves scientific humanists.
[00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:48.860]   You can read their articles.
[00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:50.500]   They write to the Sunday papers.
[00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:54.580]   I was shown an article by one of them not long ago on this very matter of religion.
[00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:59.820]   He's also a contributor to this 20th Century magazine, out of which I'm quoting.
[00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:00.820]   The man is quite fair.
[00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:02.060]   He's quite honest.
[00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:03.260]   He's not a believer.
[00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:04.260]   He's not a Christian.
[00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:05.580]   He's no use for God.
[00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:09.700]   He says, "We've got to melt God down, and we've got to make a new God for this scientific
[00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:10.700]   age."
[00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:11.700]   That's all right.
[00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:12.700]   I understand it.
[00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:14.060]   And he believes in living a good life.
[00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:17.700]   Yes, but what I'm asking is this.
[00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:22.140]   What in the last analysis is the difference between his teaching and the difference of
[00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:26.860]   a man who, in the name of the Christian Church and of Jesus Christ, says that though a man
[00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:30.260]   is an atheist, if he lives a good life, he'll be all right at the end.
[00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:32.180]   There's no difference.
[00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:33.620]   It's not a gospel.
[00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:34.620]   It's humanism.
[00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:36.940]   It's philosophy.
[00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:42.000]   Whether it is scientific humanism or any other humanism, there's nothing new about it.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.240]   There's nothing special.
[00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:44.420]   There's nothing unique.
[00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:45.500]   There's nothing marvelous.
[00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:46.500]   There's nothing wonderful.
[00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:48.380]   There's no need to have Christmas.
[00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:53.220]   It's an old teaching that the world has been trying, apart from God and Christ, throughout
[00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:54.600]   the centuries.
[00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:58.020]   But worse than that is this.
[00:41:58.020 --> 00:42:01.780]   It's not a gospel, I say, not only because it's got nothing new in it, but there's something
[00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:05.060]   worse.
[00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:10.820]   It is a teaching that leaves it all to us.
[00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:12.980]   It leaves it all to our understanding.
[00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:16.820]   It leaves it all to our efforts.
[00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:19.220]   You needn't believe in God.
[00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:20.220]   You don't believe in Christ.
[00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:21.220]   It doesn't matter.
[00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:25.700]   If you've lived a good life in this world, you're going to heaven.
[00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:26.700]   What puts you into heaven?
[00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:28.340]   Your good life.
[00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:30.020]   You save yourself.
[00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:36.620]   You make yourself a Christian, if you like, by trying to follow Christ, take his teaching,
[00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:38.260]   try to put it into practice.
[00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:43.020]   And as you do this, though you deny him, though you deny his person, though you deny everything
[00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:48.260]   concerning him, if you live a good life, do the best you can, live this good life of imitation
[00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:54.980]   of Christ's teaching, you make yourself a Christian, and you go to heaven.
[00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:58.180]   That is why I say it is not a gospel.
[00:42:58.180 --> 00:43:02.920]   That's what the apostle was saying about its form in his own day and generation.
[00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:06.200]   It's not a gospel because it leaves it all to us.
[00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:08.460]   It says that it's my good life that does it.
[00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:09.460]   It's my living.
[00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:10.460]   It's my understanding.
[00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:11.460]   It's my effort.
[00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:14.260]   It throws it all back onto me.
[00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:18.020]   And I've already seen that I'm a failure, but it still leaves it with me.
[00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:19.720]   I've got to save myself.
[00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:21.980]   But it's worse than that.
[00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:30.120]   It not only throws it back on me and leaves it to me, it thereby damns me.
[00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:37.740]   It thereby condemns me, for the task which it is allotting to me is a task which I cannot
[00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:39.020]   perform.
[00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:43.100]   I tried to show you that last Sunday night, except you be converted and become as little
[00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:44.460]   children.
[00:43:44.460 --> 00:43:47.580]   I've got to master the law that's in my members.
[00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:50.380]   I've got to master the things that drag me down.
[00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:52.900]   I've got to control them and rise above.
[00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:56.300]   I've got to master the evil that's in the world round and about me.
[00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:58.740]   I've got to imitate Christ.
[00:43:58.740 --> 00:44:00.900]   My dear friend, I'm damned.
[00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:02.900]   I'm lost.
[00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:03.900]   I can't do it.
[00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:05.340]   You can't do it.
[00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:07.460]   You probably wouldn't be in this service if you could do it.
[00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:09.180]   The men who teach it can't do it.
[00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:12.340]   They're failures themselves, and yet they land it back on us.
[00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:15.340]   A gospel, says Paul, it's not a gospel.
[00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:17.060]   It deserves to be damned.
[00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:19.460]   The man who preaches it must be anathematized.
[00:44:19.460 --> 00:44:20.820]   He must be cursed.
[00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:21.820]   Why?
[00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:26.980]   Because he's preaching in the name of Christ something that damns people to eternal perdition.
[00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:33.460]   And his language is not too strong.
[00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:39.980]   Any man who tells you or tells me that we've got to save ourselves is our greatest enemy.
[00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:40.980]   He's damning us.
[00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:43.140]   He's dooming us.
[00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:46.660]   He says you can do it, and I can't do it.
[00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:48.540]   And he does it in the name of Christ.
[00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:49.540]   Let him be accursed.
[00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:52.660]   There's nothing else to say about him.
[00:44:52.660 --> 00:45:01.700]   And that brings me to my third and my last reason in my exposition of this great apostle.
[00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:09.260]   This other teaching which masquerades as gospel but which is not a gospel, not only has no
[00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:19.780]   authority, not only is no gospel and has no good news anywhere near it, but it is to be
[00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:29.260]   anathematized and cursed particularly for this, that it denies or ignores the most glorious
[00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:33.300]   aspects of the true gospel.
[00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:35.620]   What are you talking about, Sir Simon?
[00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:38.380]   Well, this.
[00:45:38.380 --> 00:45:42.860]   What is the glory of this Christian gospel?
[00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:45.860]   Isn't it this?
[00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:53.820]   That salvation is entirely of God, not at all of men.
[00:45:53.820 --> 00:46:02.460]   "Grace be to you and peace from God the Father and from our Lord Jesus Christ who gave himself
[00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:09.500]   for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world according to the will
[00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:16.780]   of God and our Father to whom be glory forever and ever.
[00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:17.780]   Amen."
[00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:21.060]   Here it is, you see.
[00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:27.380]   Though a man doesn't believe in God, if he lives a good life, he'll go to heaven.
[00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:32.660]   Heaven is not confined to Christians only, but any man who lives a good life, he's going
[00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:36.660]   to heaven.
[00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:41.200]   This is why it must be cursed out of existence.
[00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:47.540]   It makes all this glorious statement that I've just read to you completely unnecessary.
[00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:48.540]   It dismisses it.
[00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:50.780]   It's got no use for it.
[00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:53.500]   It can get on perfectly well without it.
[00:46:53.500 --> 00:47:01.020]   The central glory of the gospel is entirely thrown overboard and dismissed as if it had
[00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:03.580]   never happened and as if it had no value.
[00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:04.580]   What is the teaching?
[00:47:04.580 --> 00:47:10.380]   Here it is, I say, that salvation is entirely of God who gave himself for our sins, that
[00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:17.780]   he might deliver us from this present evil world according to the will of God and our
[00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:18.780]   Father.
[00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:21.660]   That's what I'm preaching, says Paul.
[00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:23.180]   That's what made me a Christian.
[00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:26.900]   That's why I say this must be accursed.
[00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:35.260]   It's God the Father's will that has saved me, and this is the only gospel.
[00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:38.260]   Grace be to you and peace.
[00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:39.260]   What's this?
[00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:43.820]   Well, you see, the message of Christianity is that a man goes to heaven not as the result
[00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:49.940]   of his own good works, but as the result of the grace of God, as the result of the will
[00:47:49.940 --> 00:47:52.020]   of God.
[00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:58.100]   And it's God's grace that made God will what he did will, grace and peace.
[00:47:58.100 --> 00:48:01.140]   How can one find this peace?
[00:48:01.140 --> 00:48:05.860]   Peace from enemies within, peace from enemies without, peace with God.
[00:48:05.860 --> 00:48:06.860]   How can I get it?
[00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:09.280]   There's only one answer.
[00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:13.860]   It is according to the way that God himself has made.
[00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:15.740]   And what does grace mean?
[00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:19.500]   Grace means unmerited favor.
[00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:25.020]   Grace means that God loves us in spite of what we are, that we go to heaven not because
[00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:31.060]   of what we've done, but because of the grace and the love and the mercy and the compassion
[00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:32.060]   of God.
[00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:33.540]   What's the message?
[00:48:33.540 --> 00:48:35.140]   The message is this.
[00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:41.860]   God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto
[00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:42.940]   them.
[00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:44.500]   This is the message.
[00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:52.660]   "O loving wisdom of our God, when all was sin and shame, a second Adam to the fight
[00:48:52.660 --> 00:48:54.300]   and to the conflict came."
[00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:55.300]   This is it.
[00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:57.060]   It's all of God.
[00:48:57.060 --> 00:49:00.460]   But it isn't mentioned in this other gospel, which is not a gospel.
[00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:03.620]   You needn't believe in God, you needn't believe in Christ, you needn't believe in anything
[00:49:03.620 --> 00:49:07.060]   except yourself, and you live a good life, and you go to heaven.
[00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:08.060]   No, no.
[00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:11.000]   It shuts out this glorious thing.
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.500]   What is this glorious thing?
[00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:21.740]   "O it is this, that God in eternity before the very world was made by him, foresaw the
[00:49:21.740 --> 00:49:28.420]   sin and the rebellion of men, and his shame and his misery and his unhappiness.
[00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:35.420]   And God himself planned and willed a way whereby men could be delivered from eternal death
[00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:39.020]   and damnation and the torments of hell."
[00:49:39.020 --> 00:49:40.660]   God willed it.
[00:49:40.660 --> 00:49:42.020]   It's God's plan.
[00:49:42.020 --> 00:49:43.020]   Why did he do it?
[00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:46.420]   Man had been made by him, made perfect and was in paradise.
[00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:49.460]   Man deliberately sinned against him and brought misery on himself.
[00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:52.000]   Why didn't God allow him to stew in his own juice?
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.260]   Why didn't God tell him, "Get out of it if you can."
[00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:55.540]   But he knew it was impossible.
[00:49:55.540 --> 00:50:00.900]   O God's grace came in, his compassion, his mercy.
[00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:05.060]   He looked down upon man in his misery and he said, "I must deliver him.
[00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:06.300]   He can't deliver himself.
[00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:07.940]   I'll deliver him."
[00:50:07.940 --> 00:50:08.940]   And what did he do?
[00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:11.000]   He willed this way of salvation.
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   What is it?
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.500]   Oh, it is sending his Son.
[00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:25.060]   "Grace be to you and peace from God the Father and from our Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:26.180]   What is it?
[00:50:26.180 --> 00:50:27.840]   What is the way of salvation?
[00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:29.540]   How can a man be delivered?
[00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:31.340]   How can a man be put right for eternity?
[00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:32.780]   Living a good life?
[00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:33.780]   No, no.
[00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:35.780]   They'd all tried it in the Old Testament.
[00:50:35.780 --> 00:50:37.260]   They'd all failed.
[00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:39.140]   There is none righteous, no, not one.
[00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:40.900]   The best men are inadequate.
[00:50:40.900 --> 00:50:45.740]   There was a man, Saul of Tarsus, living a very good and moral life, but he was a failure.
[00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:47.540]   He didn't know it, but he was.
[00:50:47.540 --> 00:50:49.220]   No man can ever do it.
[00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:51.220]   This is God's way.
[00:50:51.220 --> 00:50:58.340]   God sends his own Son into the world and into the conflict and the fight and the shame.
[00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:03.460]   It's the message concerning Jesus of Nazareth, Son of God, the one who was born of a virgin
[00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:07.060]   but is never ever lost, nevertheless everlasting God.
[00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:11.780]   God, the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.
[00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:13.820]   And these men are saying it's not necessary.
[00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:16.860]   I say let them be accursed.
[00:51:16.860 --> 00:51:19.300]   They're spitting into the face of God.
[00:51:19.300 --> 00:51:22.080]   They're rejecting the sending of his Son into the world.
[00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:26.660]   They're dismissing the humiliation of the Son, the most glorious thing that's ever happened.
[00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:27.820]   They have no use for it.
[00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:30.020]   They have no need of it.
[00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:38.860]   Jesus, man, Lord, God, Christ, Savior, what did he come into the world for?
[00:51:38.860 --> 00:51:39.860]   Here it is.
[00:51:39.860 --> 00:51:51.420]   "Who gave himself for our sins that he might deliver us from this present evil world."
[00:51:51.420 --> 00:51:56.660]   No man can deliver himself far from his sins and their guilt.
[00:51:56.660 --> 00:52:02.740]   No man can deliver himself from this present evil world, the world that tried it and had
[00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:04.620]   failed before he ever came.
[00:52:04.620 --> 00:52:13.060]   He came to deliver us from the guilt of our sins.
[00:52:13.060 --> 00:52:18.060]   No man can go to heaven unless he's delivered from the guilt of his sins.
[00:52:18.060 --> 00:52:23.540]   For heaven is a place in which God dwells, and to be in heaven means to be with God.
[00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:26.180]   And if my sins and guilt are upon me, I can't.
[00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:28.740]   God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.
[00:52:28.740 --> 00:52:30.440]   No evil can dwell with him.
[00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:32.100]   You can't mix light and darkness.
[00:52:32.100 --> 00:52:38.140]   I must be delivered from the guilt of my sins and the sin that is still in my heart.
[00:52:38.140 --> 00:52:39.140]   How can I?
[00:52:39.140 --> 00:52:40.140]   I cannot.
[00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:44.380]   All my good deeds are not enough.
[00:52:44.380 --> 00:52:53.940]   "But the Son of God came into the world and gave himself for my sins on the cross on Calvary's
[00:52:53.940 --> 00:52:54.940]   hill.
[00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:57.740]   He there bore my punishment.
[00:52:57.740 --> 00:52:59.980]   He took my guilt upon himself.
[00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:06.420]   He suffered the agony that I deserved in order to set me free and to put me at peace with
[00:53:06.420 --> 00:53:07.420]   God.
[00:53:07.420 --> 00:53:16.340]   He gave himself for our sins that he might deliver us from this present evil world according
[00:53:16.340 --> 00:53:23.340]   to the will of God the Father, to whom be glory forever and ever."
[00:53:23.340 --> 00:53:29.100]   It is Christ who delivers, and Christ alone.
[00:53:29.100 --> 00:53:32.300]   And he delivers by dying.
[00:53:32.300 --> 00:53:36.820]   And any teaching that tells me that I can deliver myself, or that a man who doesn't
[00:53:36.820 --> 00:53:41.980]   believe in the incarnation and in the death of the Son for my sins and in his glorious
[00:53:41.980 --> 00:53:48.340]   resurrection and all these other elements of the faith, he has not only no gospel, he
[00:53:48.340 --> 00:53:51.700]   is a blasphemer.
[00:53:51.700 --> 00:53:57.180]   He is dismissing this amazing revelation of the love of God.
[00:53:57.180 --> 00:54:01.940]   He says that the humiliation of the Son is unnecessary, that the death and the agony
[00:54:01.940 --> 00:54:06.220]   of the cross were not needed, that he can do it all.
[00:54:06.220 --> 00:54:10.860]   I say, "May he be cursed!"
[00:54:10.860 --> 00:54:17.620]   Because he is thus dismissing the most glorious revelation of the love of God our Heavenly
[00:54:17.620 --> 00:54:18.620]   Father.
[00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:26.700]   He is likewise dismissing the glorious fact of our immediate deliverance the moment we
[00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:28.900]   believe.
[00:54:28.900 --> 00:54:34.620]   Christ delivers, sets us free, gives us a new nature, makes us new men, makes us children
[00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:42.900]   of God, delivers us out of this evil world, and prepares us for the glory which is coming.
[00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:46.300]   He gives us a hope of glory.
[00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:51.940]   Yes, even with regard to this present evil world.
[00:54:51.940 --> 00:55:00.100]   For according to this message he will come back again, and then he will gather his own
[00:55:00.100 --> 00:55:06.580]   people unto himself whom he has already delivered from it, and then he will destroy the world
[00:55:06.580 --> 00:55:15.500]   in judgment and bring in the new creation, the new heavens and the new earth wherein
[00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:20.220]   dwelleth righteousness, and all who belong to him will be there with him.
[00:55:20.220 --> 00:55:27.660]   And let me say this, there will be nobody else outside of the dogs, outside of the blasphemers,
[00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:32.980]   outside of the deniers of Christ, outside are all who belong to this present evil world.
[00:55:32.980 --> 00:55:34.460]   That is his teaching.
[00:55:34.460 --> 00:55:37.860]   It is the message of the last book of this Bible.
[00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:46.500]   No, my friend, don't you see the language of the apostle is not too strong?
[00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:55.340]   A man who offers anything but this gospel, a man who modifies it to suit modern learning
[00:55:55.340 --> 00:56:00.380]   or his own reason or understanding, what's he doing?
[00:56:00.380 --> 00:56:09.580]   He is setting God on one side, setting the plan of God on one side, dismissing the most
[00:56:09.580 --> 00:56:16.900]   glorious things that have ever happened or ever can happen or ever will happen.
[00:56:16.900 --> 00:56:28.740]   But above all, he is jeopardizing your eternal soul and its eternal destiny.
[00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:30.620]   He is leading you to hell.
[00:56:30.620 --> 00:56:33.940]   He is telling you, "Live a good life, don't bother about these beliefs, have nothing to
[00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:38.220]   do with doctrine and with these principles of the Christian faith, they don't matter.
[00:56:38.220 --> 00:56:41.580]   Live a good life, whether you believe in God or not, you'll go to heaven."
[00:56:41.580 --> 00:56:51.660]   I say that man is to be anathematized because he is putting your immortal soul and its eternal
[00:56:51.660 --> 00:57:01.100]   destiny into the most perilous and dangerous position possible.
[00:57:01.100 --> 00:57:05.300]   There is only one way of salvation.
[00:57:05.300 --> 00:57:08.740]   There is only one way to heaven.
[00:57:08.740 --> 00:57:13.300]   There is only one way to be set free from the thrall of this present evil world.
[00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:18.380]   There is only one way to be blessed of God.
[00:57:18.380 --> 00:57:28.020]   It is to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ as the Son of God, the Lamb of God that taketh
[00:57:28.020 --> 00:57:35.940]   away the sins of the whole world, the only one who can bring you to God, the one by whom
[00:57:35.940 --> 00:57:44.340]   God, God reconciles us to himself.
[00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:54.060]   My friend, this and this alone is the gospel.
[00:57:54.060 --> 00:57:56.580]   Have you believed it?
[00:57:56.580 --> 00:57:59.140]   Have you received it?
[00:57:59.140 --> 00:58:01.220]   Have you surrendered to him?
[00:58:01.220 --> 00:58:12.020]   Have you seen in your impotence and helplessness and nothingness that he must save and he alone?
[00:58:12.020 --> 00:58:14.140]   Listen to me.
[00:58:14.140 --> 00:58:18.500]   Your eternal destiny depends upon this.
[00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:27.660]   There is none other name under him given amongst men whereby we must be saved.
[00:58:27.660 --> 00:58:30.180]   Have you believed on him?
[00:58:30.180 --> 00:58:38.100]   See the truth this evening, the truth of God as revealed through his Son to the apostles
[00:58:38.100 --> 00:58:39.100]   and to us.
[00:58:39.100 --> 00:58:50.020]   Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved.
[00:58:50.020 --> 00:58:52.380]   Amen.
[00:58:52.380 --> 00:58:56.300]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
