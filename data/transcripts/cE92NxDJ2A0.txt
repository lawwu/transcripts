[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.880]   The Bethlehem College and Seminary Pastors Conference begins today on Monday here in
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.180]   Minneapolis.
[00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.800]   Your prayers are appreciated for the conference.
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.100]   Pastor John delivers the first plenary session tonight at 7 p.m. Central, addressing the
[00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.240]   topic of Christian hedonism and what it is.
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.800]   Really looking forward to that.
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.120]   And of course, earlier in January, Pastor John traveled to Louisville to speak at the
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:32.180]   annual cross-conference, a gathering of 7,500 young men and women who are seeking clarity
[00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.360]   on their call to international missions and to life evangelism.
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:43.120]   One of the sessions was a panel discussion hosted by David Platt with Pastor John, International
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:49.500]   Evangelist Max Stiles, and Pastors Thabiti Anwa-Bouylai and Kevin D. Young.
[00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.800]   In that discussion was a very important clip I wanted to share here on the podcast about
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:02.280]   one very unpopular truth that drives gospel sacrifice, namely the doctrine, the reality,
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.500]   of the eternal judgment of sinners under the just and holy wrath of God.
[00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.000]   As uncomfortable as this doctrine is, we cannot ignore it.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.120]   Our friend Max Stiles picks up the conversation.
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.600]   We can't air-condition hell.
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.920]   Hell is real.
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:27.520]   It is eternal suffering, and people are really going there.
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:34.180]   And we want to make sure that the world hears the saving knowledge of Christ so that they
[00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.680]   can be saved from hell.
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:47.080]   It's easy to be overwhelmed when you stand in places in India or China and look over
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:56.800]   these vast numbers of people and realize that without the Word, without the Word of God,
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:03.320]   these people are lost and without hope in the world and are facing eternal suffering.
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:10.920]   It's hard to take that sometimes, but it's the reality that we face, and it's easily
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.200]   missed.
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.960]   People don't want to talk about it often in mission conferences, but it should be one
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.320]   of the driving things that we want to advance.
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:28.620]   It seems so obvious, but I mean, having led a mission organization for four years and
[00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.480]   been exposed to the broader missions world, it's actually uncommon to hear that truth
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:42.280]   emphasized even in a missions conference, which we believe misses the Word of God.
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.000]   Can I give you one sentence, and you're going to need this.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.120]   If you have any bone in your body that's sympathetic to that emphasis right there that our biggest
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:59.480]   problem is hell, not hunger, here's the sentence.
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.720]   Christians care about all suffering.
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.560]   So you list your favorite social issue there, which I hope you care about with all your
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.720]   might.
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:16.560]   Christians care about all suffering, especially eternal suffering.
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.520]   Nail that sentence down and see if you believe it.
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:29.880]   Christians care and will show that they care about all human suffering, especially eternal
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:30.880]   suffering.
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:39.200]   So if your life is marked by compassion for all suffering except eternal suffering, you're
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.360]   a defective lover.
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.440]   That's what this conference believes.
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.480]   And so things are going to be missing here, right?
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.200]   We can't do everything.
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.800]   So the especially really counts.
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.760]   And there's so much more that needs to be said than what we can say.
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:03.560]   But if you went to the churches of these men and every pastor in here, you'd find all
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.560]   kinds of suffering being addressed rightly.
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.680]   But somebody's got to wave the flag today when it's so politically incorrect to do so
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:19.200]   that we care about eternal suffering especially.
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.760]   >> You know, thank you, John.
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:32.280]   The doctrine of hell is ballast in our boat that keeps us from capsizing, keeps us from
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.680]   wavering and being tossed to and fro.
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:41.200]   Some of you here are inclusivists, and you don't even know that term, and you didn't
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.920]   even study it, and it's just the air that you breathe and that's what you think.
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:53.280]   Not the good sort of we include people, but theologically inclusivists, meaning you believe
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:59.480]   that people who never hear of Christ, never have the opportunity to respond to Christ,
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:04.760]   will go to heaven because of the good that they have done or perhaps the light that they
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:11.640]   have followed or perhaps they have known Christ without knowing that they know Christ.
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.720]   Some sort of anonymous Christianity.
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:22.320]   That is rampant among people of all ages in our churches, and even the great C.S. Lewis
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.240]   teaches that in mere Christianity, and you see it at the end of the Chronicles of Narnia.
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:33.200]   He was a worshiper of Tash, but really he was a worshiper of Aslan without realizing
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.320]   it.
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:39.400]   Not only is that mistaken with all of the verses from the Great Commission to Romans
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.680]   10, it's mistaken with our doctrine of the Trinity.
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:50.480]   The Holy Spirit does not work indiscriminately to save people apart from throwing a spotlight
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:54.120]   on the glory of Jesus Christ.
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:59.400]   So that's our ballast, that's our mission, that's our emphasis, and as John said, it
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:10.040]   is massively unpopular, not just with a world out there, but with student groups all over
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:16.840]   this country, all over the world, and this conference exists not to say we got things
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:24.120]   right, people got things wrong, but because the truths of God's Word in all of their particularity
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.280]   and angularity will serve you.
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:32.720]   We were talking just at dinner, and John said this beforehand, theology in the short run
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:39.720]   will slow you down on mission, but in the long run it will sustain you for a life of
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:40.720]   mission.
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.000]   If you want to worship deeply, you've got to think deeply, and you need your theology
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:52.600]   to go as deep down as you want your worship to go up high, and that means being absolutely
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:58.080]   crystal clear on these things, that our burden is to have the theology going deep down with
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:05.360]   roots for a very particular fruit that we're praying for in this conference, namely that
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:17.120]   7,500 of you would be mobilized for mission, some going, many more probably sending, but
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:23.640]   mobilized for a lifetime of mission, and that will not come without robust theological commitments
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:27.880]   like the kind that we're trying to celebrate from God's Word during this week.
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:33.640]   - Amen, and then several minutes later as the panel discussion drew to a conclusion,
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:38.960]   the conversation moved toward why the Cross Conference is set up the way it is, relatively
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:45.160]   simple in its programming and rather sobered in its temper, a very distinct mood from most
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.640]   young adult conferences.
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:53.000]   The question was asked to Pastor John, speaking to the 7,500 gathered attendees.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.640]   Here's what he said.
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:08:01.400]   - When I think of 800 or 7,000 responding the way we want, I'm really nervous about
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.400]   that.
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:09.520]   I mean, not anxious, but sobered because you're gonna die.
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:16.800]   It says in Revelation 12, 11 that the martyrs under the altar in heaven crying out, "How
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:17.800]   long?
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:18.800]   How long, O Lord?"
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:27.080]   The word they get from the king is, "Be quiet and rest because the number of your brothers
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:30.360]   who are yet to be martyred is not complete."
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:35.160]   We're not playing games here.
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:41.720]   I had a dad at an airport sending his son off who looked me in the eye and said, "If
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:44.440]   he doesn't come back, I will kill you."
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.440]   Wow.
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:49.040]   "I will kill you."
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:51.360]   That's what I expect to happen.
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:56.160]   Parents are gonna hate what we get you to do if they've got dreams for you to make a
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.080]   lot of money.
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:04.720]   So there's a sobriety and a seriousness about the reality of the wrath of God and hell,
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:11.760]   the reality of lost people, the reality of John Piper's sin at age 73 that's the most
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.680]   burdensome thing I know.
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:18.000]   There's a reality about this that just causes us not to play games here.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.560]   We are, we are seriously joyful, Mac.
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:28.640]   Isaiah 67, 4 back there, that says, "Let the nations be glad."
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:29.640]   That's our message.
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:33.560]   Because you're gonna perish if you don't rejoice in God.
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.720]   If you rejoice in everything but God.
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.600]   So there's a kind of paradox here.
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.560]   We are serious about joy.
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:50.800]   We really want the nations to be happy forever, not happy for 80 years and perish forever.
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:58.320]   So that is what creates the mood in me and I think what you will feel a little bit maybe
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:05.640]   different about the simplicity and sobriety of this conference.
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:10.480]   That landed with a weightiness befitting the tenor of the entire conference and with that
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:15.920]   word the discussion came to an end at which point David Platt held up a copy of Let the
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:21.760]   Nations Be Glad, John Piper's book on mission, and Platt went on to commend it saying this,
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:26.120]   "I would say without question this book has shaped my understanding of God's passion for
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:31.320]   his glory in all nations from cover to cover through scripture more than any other book
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:33.520]   I've ever read," he said.
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:38.520]   Then he continued, "And God has seen fit to bless this book in ways that have changed
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:42.520]   the trajectories of many lives."
[00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:47.320]   And then he announced that everyone in attendance was getting a free copy of the book and oh
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:53.440]   my what could the Lord do through those thousands of copies in the lives of those young men
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:57.920]   and women trying to discern God's call on their lives.
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:58.920]   Imagine it.
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:03.380]   And if you're a financial partner of Desiring Gods you were by proxy there in the room funding
[00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:06.360]   that strategic timely book giveaway.

[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   this podcast.
