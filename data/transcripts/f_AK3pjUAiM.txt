[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.080]   [ Applause ]
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.640]   All right, before we get started with the first event,
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.320]   I'd like to introduce somebody in the audience,
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.040]   and that is Mike Nolan.
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.200]   Mike was Jack's assistant.
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.000]   A lot of you know Mike.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.760]   [ Applause ]
[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.920]   Mike was Jack's assistant, helped write how many books?
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.080]   At least four books, four or five books,
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.160]   and is still at Vanguard and is my number one go-to guy
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.760]   for anything I need from Vanguard,
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.480]   including people to interview,
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.280]   which brings us to our guest today.
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.160]   I have a question, though, in the room.
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:46.480]   How many people here own a Vanguard index fund?
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.240]   Okay. The fellow today who I'm going
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.840]   to speak with is your fund manager.
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.160]   So if you have any complaints --
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.800]   [ Laughter ]
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.400]   Anyway, I am pleased, we are so pleased
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.920]   to have Jerry O'Reilly as our speaker today.
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.560]   He is a principal and portfolio manager at Vanguard,
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:16.480]   and he oversees the $1.4 trillion Vanguard total stock
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.840]   market index fund, which is the largest mutual fund
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.200]   in the world, and he also oversees 16 other funds
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.920]   of which I believe you said five of them have your name on it.
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:34.880]   So in total, I believe, about $4 trillion.
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.280]   Is that a rough estimate?
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.040]   Yeah. Which is 10% of the value of the entire stock market.
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.000]   Guy's important, right?
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.960]   So with no further ado, let me introduce Jerry O'Reilly.
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.800]   Please come up to the stage.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:02:09.800]   [ Applause ]
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.080]   >> That's yours.
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.400]   This is mine.
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.680]   >> Okay, good.
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.000]   Good to go.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.280]   Well, again, thank you for being here.
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.600]   And my numbers were pretty correct, right?
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.880]   $4 trillion?
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.200]   >> Your numbers are good, yeah.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.720]   [ Laughter ]
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.000]   >> I do, yeah.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.120]   I do. You know, a lot of it is
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.400]   because I'm exhausted when I get home,
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.080]   so there's no problem there.
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.040]   But, yeah, I mean, listen, I am the name person on there,
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.320]   and I am surrounded with a phenomenal team that I work with.
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.320]   And so, you know, we have 25 people, Rick,
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.840]   that manage that $4 trillion and change with, you know,
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.840]   average tenure I'd say about 12, 13 years, which is unusual
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.280]   in terms of, you know, the tenure.
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.640]   But, like, when we hire people, it's all about, you know,
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.720]   how are they going to work in that team environment?
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.160]   How are they going to work in terms of collaboration?
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.560]   I know that if I'm jammed on something, there's like three,
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.560]   four people I can go to to have them pick up the lead.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.760]   So we pride ourselves kind of in the team concept.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:06.880]   But it is great.
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.080]   I mean, you know, I started off entry level
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.480]   on the phones at Vanguard.
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:18.360]   And, you know, my first paycheck, I remember,
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.160]   coming home, and I said to my wife, "Yep."
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.280]   I said, "We're starting."
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.920]   And she was working in a shoe store.
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.360]   And I think, you know, I remember thinking, "Well,
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.200]   it's a start."
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.440]   I got my foot in the door.
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.480]   And within three years, I was on the desk.
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.600]   And I felt like this is what my passion --
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.880]   this is where my passion lies.
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.640]   >> Now, you have an interesting background.
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.360]   So I'm going to go back even before then.
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.200]   And you were born and raised in Ireland.
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.080]   >> Partly correct.
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.960]   I was -- I grew up in Ireland.
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:50.200]   But my mom and dad -- so my dad was one of 17 kids.
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:50.840]   >> Seventeen?
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:51.360]   >> Seventeen.
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.080]   One-seven.
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:58.000]   No twins. Grew up -- I have an aunt who's five years older
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.360]   than me, my Aunt Mary.
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.080]   And if you asked me to list all 17, I'd be stretched.
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.160]   I'd be here for a while.
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.680]   But dad was -- grew up on a farm in Cowles County Mead,
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.400]   outside Cowles County Mead.
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.920]   Probably some of you have heard of the Book of Cowles.
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.240]   So that's where, you know, Cowles is.
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.520]   And dad, when he was in his early 20s,
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.480]   someone locally had gone to Canada to work
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.960]   in a town called Uranium City.
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:25.480]   Which, if you look at a globe, where Saskatchewan turns
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.760]   from green to white, Uranium City is well up into the white.
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.720]   So dad and four or five local 20-year-olds went over there.
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.320]   And that's where he made his money.
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.240]   And my mom, he came back and they got married.
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.640]   And I was born in Uranium City, Canada.
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:43.200]   >> Oh, isn't that right?
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.640]   >> And when I was two years old, they brought me back to Ireland.
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.760]   And mom is from outside Cowles, too.
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.280]   And yeah, grew up in Ireland.
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.680]   And then, you know, things --
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:55.680]   >> Well, okay.
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.280]   So you were a track star.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.920]   And you were recruited to go to college here
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:02.960]   in the United States.
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:03.600]   >> Yep.
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.600]   >> And then you were actually an Olympic athlete.
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.200]   >> I was, yes.
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.200]   >> Tell us about that.
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.200]   >> So it was a few pounds ago, Rick.
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.120]   I used to be 152.
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.840]   But that's what happens when you run, you know,
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.800]   90, 100 miles a week training.
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:27.680]   But yeah, I mean, I -- from 1976 was a pivotal year for me.
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:28.880]   I was 12 years old.
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.520]   So you guys are all doing the math now.
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.480]   You're like, hmm, okay, I see what age he is.
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:36.520]   I was watching the Montreal Olympics.
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.400]   And there was a guy from Ireland who was like our LeBron James.
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.360]   His name was Eamon Coughlin.
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.000]   He was a runner.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.200]   He was at Villanova.
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.920]   And he was favorite to win the 1500 meters.
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.640]   And I had started running at that point.
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.520]   And I was fairly good.
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.440]   And I remember watching a documentary on Eamon
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.840]   and seeing like, hey, he's going to school.
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.720]   He's representing Ireland.
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:56.880]   And he was a favorite.
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.440]   As it turns out, he finished fourth.
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:59.520]   And it was a great disappointment.
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.800]   But I remember he just planted a seed with me thinking, man,
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.680]   if I was good enough as a runner,
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.640]   I could actually get a scholarship.
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:10.000]   I could, you know, potentially set me off for a career.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.160]   And I would go -- you know, we lived
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.880]   out in the country back home.
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.240]   And I would come home from school, drop the bag off
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.200]   when the family was having dinner.
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.400]   And I'd go out and run seven,
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.240]   eight miles by myself on country roads.
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.760]   And at the back of my head was this --
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.720]   fueling me was this potential
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.760]   that someday maybe I'll have an opportunity
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.120]   to get a scholarship.
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.000]   And when I was a senior in high school,
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.080]   I won the Irish National Championships.
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.680]   And all of a sudden, I had 12 scholarship offers.
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:38.840]   And my mom, being Catholic from Ireland, she's like,
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.360]   Villanova's a Catholic school.
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.160]   That's where you're going.
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.120]   And so that was the end of it.
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.760]   And so I ended up in the fall of '83,
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.880]   showing up at Villanova campus, yeah.
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.120]   >> Well, I just have to -- I just have to --
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.840]   because you did walk into the stadium at Seoul, Korea.
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.200]   And, you know, all those people in the opening ceremony.
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.080]   I mean, just tell us just a little bit
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.080]   about that experience.
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.400]   >> Yeah. I was fine until someone yelled from the stands
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.800]   that there's 200 million people watching you.
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.400]   The thing about the Seoul Olympics,
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.840]   and you can Google this, they brought all the teams in.
[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:13.320]   And I was -- there was maybe 100 people on the Irish team
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.320]   between, you know, all the different sports,
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.360]   officials, and everything else.
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.200]   Phenomenal.
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.800]   The whole day just was incredible.
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:23.800]   They bring you into the stadium, and you line up on the infield.
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.560]   And, of course, it's time to light the torch.
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:26.880]   The cauldron.
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.160]   And what they did was they released a couple
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.160]   of hundred doves as a sign of peace.
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.400]   And where do you think the doves landed?
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.120]   On the cauldron.
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.560]   And then two athletes went up and lit the cauldron.
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.440]   And that's the last time the Olympic Games have let
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:41.920]   off live birds.
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.000]   It's not a pretty sight.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.880]   I showed it to my kids on my daughter's jaw
[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:48.560]   like she was 10 at the time, and her face just dropped.
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.240]   She's like, the birds.
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.960]   But, yeah, you can Google that.
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:53.280]   But phenomenal experience.
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:57.960]   Just as a 24-year-old, oh, incredible to be there.
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:02.080]   And then how did you get a job at Vanguard?
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:06.240]   So there was a guy who Mike knows well
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.160]   who used to compete against me named Jim Norris.
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.440]   And Jim ended up being--
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:11.720]   he was an assistant to Mr. Bogle for a number of years.
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.680]   He would have been involved in some of the earlier books,
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:16.200]   whereas Mike was involved in some of the later books.
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.320]   Jim and I would meet at--
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:19.440]   would race each other.
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:20.400]   He went to St. Joe's.
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.280]   I went to Villanova.
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:24.640]   They're literally four miles apart.
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.960]   And I got to a point in my career
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.720]   where I was making some money from running
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:33.640]   Rick, but not enough to walk in and potentially buy a house
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:36.240]   or even buy a car.
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.720]   And I remember thinking, I need to find something
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:39.560]   a little more stable.
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:41.360]   And Vanguard was half an hour away,
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.400]   and Jim was working there already.
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.360]   And he said, listen, I'll drop off your resume.
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.120]   And that's how he got my foot in the door,
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.920]   as I said, as an entry-level person on the phones.
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.680]   And within like a month or two, I
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:54.840]   knew that I was going to be here for a while.
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:55.800]   And it's interesting.
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.040]   You've been there for 31 years now?
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.120]   31 years in March, yeah.
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.000]   And that's a real testament to me to Vanguard,
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.080]   because they hold their employees for so long.
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:07.040]   Yeah, I mean, I think when we hire--
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:11.120]   I mean, when I interview people, I'm not interviewing somebody
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.480]   that I want to be on the desk for two or three years.
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:16.400]   I'm hiring somebody that I can see 20 years,
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.760]   25 years down the road.
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:21.240]   And I think Vanguard does a really good job of making sure
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:27.000]   that just the whole quality of just your work-life balance
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:27.500]   is good.
[00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:32.560]   I mean, I have four kids, and they're all in their 20s now.
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:38.480]   But when they were 8, 10, if there was a dance recital,
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:43.400]   a ball game, it was no problem for me to run out and catch
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.880]   that, and you feel kind of like-- and then
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:50.480]   when you work with people like Mike Buick, Gus Sauter,
[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:54.440]   and you learn from people like that, and you just--
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:57.920]   Gus was probably one of those guys, the most humble person.
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:00.040]   And I know he's spoken to the Bogleheads
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:01.520]   on a number of occasions.
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:04.400]   But it's just contagious.
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:08.080]   I would have ran through a wall for Gus, that type of person.
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:08.840]   And it just--
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.320]   I mean, I just absolutely--
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:13.240]   I tell people, interns who come by the desk looking
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:15.860]   for a little-- I say, listen, I'm 31 years at Vanguard.
[00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:20.040]   On a Sunday night, when I hear the 60 minutes clock,
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.280]   I'm like, OK, works tomorrow.
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:22.120]   Awesome.
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.440]   I'm looking at the futures.
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.760]   I'm figuring out what we're going to be doing tomorrow.
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.880]   And it just, to me, it doesn't feel like a job.
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:32.360]   Well, let's go ahead and get into the portfolio management.
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:36.120]   Let's first talk about the Vanguard Total Stock Market
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:39.680]   Index Fund, $1.4 trillion, roughly?
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.080]   Yeah, a tad under, yeah.
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:43.760]   And that includes both all share classes.
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:44.800]   All share classes, yeah.
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:48.380]   Just for clarification, Vanguard has a little different
[00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:51.540]   approach to ETFs versus mutual funds,
[00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:54.500]   where it's all the same pool of money.
[00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:55.220]   Yes.
[00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:57.580]   Could you talk about that and how it's split up, then,
[00:10:57.580 --> 00:10:58.540]   at a different level?
[00:10:58.540 --> 00:10:59.060]   It is, yeah.
[00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:03.020]   So in total stock market, we have the VTI share class.
[00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:04.220]   We have admiral share class.
[00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:05.740]   We have institutional share class.
[00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:08.140]   To me, it's all just one large pool of money,
[00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:09.880]   which makes it easier to manage.
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:12.100]   And there's also benefits to that multi-share class.
[00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:16.720]   So for example, whenever there's corporate actions going on
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.720]   where you potentially have adds to the index,
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:23.320]   if it's a standalone, I would need to sell, basically,
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.160]   to raise money to buy the stock that's
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.620]   getting added to the index.
[00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:28.400]   But in total stock market, on any given day,
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:31.640]   I could have $500 million coming in in cash flows.
[00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:33.000]   I could have corporate actions.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.520]   For example, yesterday, I came in in the morning
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:37.480]   thinking it was going to be a nice, quiet day.
[00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:41.320]   And all of a sudden, Activision is halted.
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:44.160]   And I have to spend $2.2 billion at the end of the day
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:49.000]   because I get $95 a share times all the shares of Activision
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:49.920]   I have.
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:53.840]   And now I'm talking to NASDAQ about potentially,
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:55.200]   is it going to be halted all day?
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.720]   Is it just for the morning?
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:59.140]   And what's the repercussions of that for all of the funds
[00:11:59.140 --> 00:11:59.960]   that we manage?
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:03.240]   And for my funds, I needed to spend that cash
[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:06.040]   and spread that across the rest of the 4,000
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:08.640]   on securities in the index.
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:10.880]   The share class also, when we have redeemed--
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:13.000]   so if somebody does a create--
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.800]   I'm talking about APs who are dealing in $20, $50, $100
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:17.920]   million.
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:21.920]   Authorized participants are the people who create
[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.360]   and redeem the ETF shares.
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:27.840]   Yeah, when they redeem, we're able to give them
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:29.160]   the lower cost basis stocks.
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.920]   So take a stock, for example, like NVIDIA,
[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:33.760]   which is up close to 200% for the year.
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:35.560]   We can give them the NVIDIA shares
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:37.240]   that we have at low cost basis, which
[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:40.080]   tends to make the fund more tax efficient overall.
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.960]   So I want to just dig into that a little bit.
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:43.040]   Because you do have this--
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:49.360]   I call it a double-edged sword on tax efficiency of a fund
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.360]   like the Vanguard Total Stock Market Fund.
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:56.440]   If you have a stock that went down in value,
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:59.440]   so the basis is higher, and you're actually losing money,
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:03.960]   you would redeem that for cash and take the loss in the fund?
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.520]   You potentially have the option--
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.340]   so you can basically determine, when
[00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:08.960]   you're talking to our fund accounting,
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:11.800]   which shares do we want to hand out?
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.520]   So potentially, you could do that.
[00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:17.020]   The primary goal, Rick, is to make sure
[00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:18.440]   that we're tracking the benchmark.
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.400]   But there are different tools available.
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.360]   One would be the in-kind process.
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:24.440]   The other would be potentially tax harvests
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:25.640]   at certain times of the year.
[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:27.400]   So names like, for example, that we
[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:30.040]   might have a cost basis of here that are down here,
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:32.520]   if you sell those names, as long as you don't buy them back
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:34.800]   within 30 days because of the wash sale rule,
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.040]   you're able to realize a loss.
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:41.080]   So we do look to try and keep about 170 to 200 basis
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.720]   points of a cushion of realized losses in the fund
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:46.240]   so that we're not distributing gains to the shareholders.
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:48.400]   I think one of the big concerns is,
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:52.760]   when you look at the data on Vanguard Total Stock Market,
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:54.600]   it says unrealized gains.
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.480]   And it would look like there's a huge, huge amount.
[00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:59.380]   And sometimes the media gets a hold of this.
[00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:03.240]   And they say, oh, if people started selling this fund,
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:07.760]   you're going to get hit with big capital gain distributions.
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.120]   But it's not really true, is it?
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:11.560]   No, I mean, it is something that we monitor literally
[00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:13.960]   on a weekly basis in terms of the capital gains.
[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:16.520]   And if we start to see that realized losses are getting
[00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:19.000]   below that kind of 170 basis points,
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.800]   we start to take action on it.
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:24.000]   And sometimes it's like we have, as you mentioned,
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.680]   the CRISP indexes.
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:28.680]   They do rebalances once a quarter.
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:31.940]   So if you think about it, we just had one in September.
[00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:36.120]   If we sell names in the third Friday in September
[00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:40.240]   or during the five-day period, if they're not
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:42.560]   large names in the fund and they're
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:45.920]   stocks that we have a significant loss in the name,
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:49.320]   we can just put those names on hold for a period of 30 days.
[00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:50.780]   Now, these might be stocks that have
[00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:52.960]   a weight in the index of less than a basis point.
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.620]   But they could be very tax-efficient when
[00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:56.480]   it comes to realizing losses.
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.480]   So we have a whole team that kind of works with us
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:01.200]   in terms of helping us identify what those names are
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:03.400]   and making sure that you don't have any concentration
[00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:07.080]   in any industries or sectors, or if that sector rebounded
[00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:08.880]   over the 30 days, you would be hurt.
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:11.120]   So making sure we do it in a diversified manner.
[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:14.040]   So on the mutual fund side, you're
[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:16.840]   able to take losses and build up these capital losses
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:18.840]   because you're going to do it in cash.
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:20.080]   You're going to sell in cash.
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:24.400]   But on the ETF side, if you have a big gain
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:30.040]   and you want to push that gain out of the fund
[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:33.360]   without the shareholders incurring a capital gain,
[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:35.840]   you'll go through authorized participants.
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:37.000]   So explain that process.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.360]   I mean, how does that work, where
[00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:41.800]   you are able to push the stock out and the fund itself
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.040]   not actually take the gain?
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:47.520]   Yeah, I mean, it's, I think, all ETF providers,
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:49.680]   because of the in-kind mechanism,
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:53.800]   where if you have a stock, for example, that
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:58.880]   has a significant gain, if an AP comes in and does
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:04.440]   a create, and on the way out, they receive that stock,
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:08.160]   because it's done in-kind, the NAV of the fund
[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.640]   really has the gain in it.
[00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:14.720]   And it's not realized until a shareholder sells,
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:16.320]   whether that's in six months.
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.600]   So it's just deferring the gain is really
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.720]   what it's doing through the ETF mechanism.
[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:23.840]   So the create, then, is this basket
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:26.800]   of stocks that comes in from the authorized participant, which
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:30.640]   is maybe a JP Morgan, or Goldman Sachs, or somebody.
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:33.280]   This whole basket of stocks comes in.
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:37.080]   And that comes into the fund.
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.160]   You're not buying this.
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:40.080]   This comes in through the ETF mechanism.
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:42.040]   So they would give us the shares of the basket.
[00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:44.000]   We would give them shares of the ETF.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.280]   And on the other side, when they want to redeem those ETF shares,
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:49.760]   they bring the ETF shares in.
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:52.160]   And you have to hand out stock.
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:55.040]   And the stock you give them is high-cost basis stock.
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:55.920]   100%.
[00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:56.600]   There we go.
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:57.520]   Yep.
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:58.040]   OK.
[00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:01.040]   And that's how it becomes more tax efficient, even
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:03.800]   to the opened-end fund shareholders,
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:05.880]   because it's all part of the same money.
[00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:07.000]   Same pool of money, yeah.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:07.680]   Very good.
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:09.420]   And I always thought that was fascinating.
[00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:10.880]   And I read the paper that I think
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:13.200]   it was Gus wrote on this back, I don't know, 2000
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:15.440]   or whenever it was, where then you went out
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:17.600]   and got a patent on this.
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:19.440]   And now the patent has come off, has it not?
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:20.400]   The patent has expired.
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.400]   And I think there are a couple of asset managers
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:23.320]   that are doing it.
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:25.000]   I think DFA is looking at it.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:25.960]   Yeah.
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:26.720]   Interesting.
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:28.040]   Well, very good.
[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:30.800]   I'm curious.
[00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:32.560]   We did mention the index.
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:36.720]   So the index that the Total Stock Market Index Fund tracks
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:42.280]   now is the CRISP Total Stock Market Index.
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.480]   And CRISP is-- well, we call it CRISP.
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:47.480]   It's the Center for Research in Security Prices,
[00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:49.600]   which is owned by the University of Chicago.
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:55.200]   Currently, 3,800 stocks in that index.
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.840]   But it wasn't always that index.
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:00.360]   I mean, back in the day, it was the Wilshire 5,000.
[00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:03.400]   And then it turned into an MSCI index for a while.
[00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:05.280]   And then it moved over to the CRISP index.
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:08.400]   So these indexes do change once in a while.
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:13.560]   That's a huge event for your desk
[00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:15.560]   when an index changes, correct?
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:16.060]   Correct.
[00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:17.600]   And what do you have to do?
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:19.000]   How do you get it aligned?
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.280]   Well, lots of times--
[00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:24.200]   so I remember those days, Rick, where
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:25.400]   we had the Wilshire 5,000.
[00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:28.920]   And I think going from Wilshire to MSCI,
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:32.120]   there were reasons that we had concerns about Wilshire, which
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:33.240]   back then--
[00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:36.600]   I mean, index methodology has become somewhat commoditized
[00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:37.320]   now.
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:39.180]   It's got little flavors on the margins
[00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:40.520]   that are a little bit different.
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:42.200]   But in terms of just the basic--
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:43.920]   and Gus contributed to this in a paper
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:46.480]   he wrote back in the early 2000s as well.
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:49.040]   But for example, a simple thing like float.
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:52.520]   So let's say, for example, you have a company, a biotech
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:54.840]   company, and the insiders own 80%.
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:57.160]   So really, there's only 20% of the shares outstanding
[00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:59.160]   or available to the public.
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:01.800]   Wilshire would say, nope, all the shares
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:03.200]   available to the public.
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:06.120]   So when a name got added, you had indexers trying
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:08.820]   to buy as if there was 100% of the shares outstanding
[00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:09.840]   available.
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:12.720]   And we would cause huge impact on these names.
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:15.320]   So the idea of float adjustment came about.
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:18.280]   And MSCI had some things that we thought were desirable.
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:19.160]   So we moved.
[00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:22.400]   But when we move from one index to another, it's a big deal.
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:27.000]   And oftentimes, it takes months to convert from your existing--
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.440]   here's your current index--
[00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:31.520]   to the pro forma, the one that you're heading towards.
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:32.520]   It needs to be done.
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:34.520]   I mean, because ideally, what you're trying to do
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:37.440]   is do it without realizing gains,
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:40.480]   without having any kind of substantial tracking error.
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:42.920]   And CRISP, when we moved to CRISP,
[00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:45.960]   I think that was primarily for cost certainty.
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:48.620]   So as you guys know, when I started at Vanguard,
[00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:50.040]   I think our average expense ratio
[00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:51.960]   was around 30 basis points.
[00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:55.440]   And it's come down to, on an asset-weighted basis now,
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:57.320]   around eight basis points.
[00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:01.040]   And I think Vanguard felt like, hey, if we're offering funds
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:05.340]   and we're giving investors the benefit of economies of scale
[00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:10.320]   because of our size, we had this index licensing thing out there
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:13.920]   that we felt like we need to get this under control
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:17.000]   for the long term so that we're not--
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.040]   like, if you think about VTI, it's got a three basis point
[00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:20.020]   expense ratio.
[00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:23.040]   It wouldn't make sense to be paying a licensing fee
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:24.300]   close to that number.
[00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:27.000]   So I think with CRISP, we got a long term
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.360]   where we got cost certainty.
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:31.080]   And it also helped that CRISP's methodology, we thought,
[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:32.640]   was best in class.
[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:35.000]   MSCI is still really, really good in terms--
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.480]   we use it for the sector funds.
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:38.280]   But as I mentioned, a lot of the indexes
[00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:41.480]   have become somewhat commoditized now.
[00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:48.240]   So you've got 3,800 US stocks in the CRISP index, of which
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:51.120]   you own all 3,800?
[00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:51.680]   Give or take.
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:54.120]   Yeah, there may be some at the very bottom decile that
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:56.320]   just trade by appointment.
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:58.680]   That's where I actually want to go to.
[00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:02.520]   So how many of these 3,800 stocks are actually liquid?
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:03.880]   You could go out to the market.
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.400]   You can buy them.
[00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:07.640]   And how do you handle those trades?
[00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:10.360]   And then how many of them are illiquid,
[00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:12.640]   where you've got to handle them differently,
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:14.160]   and then explain that process?
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:15.400]   Yeah, great question.
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:20.760]   So I would say the top 1,500 names, very liquid.
[00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:22.320]   No issues at all trading them.
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:25.320]   If you have a-- like that list I mentioned yesterday
[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:28.120]   for Activision, when we had to spend all the cash from it.
[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:30.560]   When I generated a trade list around 3 o'clock yesterday,
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:36.480]   I think I had 1,400 names, and very, very liquid names.
[00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:42.720]   The issue and the names that I spend most of the time trading
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:44.800]   are the tail, the exact names that you
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:46.960]   referred to, Rick, which are the ones in the bottom,
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:49.600]   say, three deciles, 7, 8, 9, and 10,
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:51.000]   the ones that are very difficult.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.560]   And what we do there is, every Monday morning, we'll come in.
[00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:56.640]   I'll run a $200 million list of those names that are--
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.920]   so we have the ability to basically say,
[00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:02.280]   on our trading platform, to say, I want to generate a trade list,
[00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:05.200]   but I want you to focus on the bottom four deciles.
[00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:08.600]   And by deciles, you mean-- so we rank them 1 through 10,
[00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:10.160]   the ones that are the most liquid.
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:13.320]   Apple would be up in decile 1, all the way down to the bottom.
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:15.040]   And then focus on those.
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:16.880]   And those are the names that are really bad.
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:19.080]   And then what we do is we break it up between five or six
[00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:19.580]   traders.
[00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:21.760]   So every trader gets 40 or 50 names.
[00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.720]   And we keep them out there for the entire week.
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:26.120]   And I tell the traders, let's be opportunistic.
[00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:29.320]   So in the US, we have 16 different exchanges.
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:31.200]   We have 40 pools of liquidity.
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.240]   So it's a little bit like whack-a-mole when you're trying
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:34.400]   to trade one of these names.
[00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:36.240]   You don't know where the seller is at.
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:39.020]   We have access to brokers who focus just
[00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:41.120]   on illiquid small cap names.
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:44.240]   We have-- we'll run these names through all sorts
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:47.240]   of dark pools, ATSs.
[00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:51.680]   If a broker happens to be doing a small cap rebalance where
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:55.440]   maybe a manager is getting out of some small cap names,
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:56.940]   they might call and say, hey, we've
[00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:58.600]   got a lot of small caps on our pad today
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.720]   and see if we can get a match with those names.
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:04.460]   And for the entire five days, we'll just focus on those.
[00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:06.040]   And then the bigger names, Rick, those
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:08.920]   are the names that we will, if we have a trade list,
[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:11.200]   cash coming into the fund around 3 o'clock
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:12.700]   is when we'll generate a trade list.
[00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:15.320]   That's when we're buying the Apples, Microsofts.
[00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:16.920]   And those are the easy names to trade.
[00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:20.320]   It also is very nice that the most liquid time
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:23.460]   of the day in the market is that last 45 minutes.
[00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:25.680]   I think 25% of the total day's volume
[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:26.880]   is in that last 25 minutes.
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:30.280]   So you're trading when the spreads are the narrowest
[00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:32.840]   and the top-of-the-book liquidity is at its greatest.
[00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:35.540]   So it is very easy to trade in that type of environment.
[00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:38.080]   But that's kind of how we get the exposure to the small cap,
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:41.320]   running that list and then being opportunistic if there
[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:42.480]   are small caps available.
[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:44.680]   And those are names we'd be happy to get an execution
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:45.920]   at 10, 30, 11 in the morning.
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:46.680]   It doesn't matter.
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:48.880]   Because they're such tiny names in the index,
[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:51.120]   it's not really going to impact at all.
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:53.800]   Let me ask a question about new issues, IPOs,
[00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:55.560]   brand new companies coming to the market.
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:57.800]   Now, they don't go right into the index right away.
[00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:58.320]   That's right.
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:23:59.600]   It takes a little bit of time.
[00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:04.000]   Like you said, Chris adds them periodically.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.560]   Yeah, so on that, Rick, if it's large enough,
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:10.960]   Chris will add it in five days.
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:13.520]   Five days for a large IPO.
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:16.640]   And that's incredible, because back in the day,
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:19.240]   it sometimes would be three months, six months.
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:22.400]   And considering our size, if you have the ability,
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:27.760]   there is this massive liquidity event when an IPO happens.
[00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:30.480]   And you probably saw it this week with Birkenstocks,
[00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:32.560]   even though it wasn't added to any of the indexes,
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:35.160]   because it doesn't have a US domicile,
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:37.040]   or it's not incorporated in the US.
[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:39.120]   So I'm not sure where it's going to end up.
[00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:42.560]   But you have this massive volume rush.
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:45.480]   And to be able to trade in that is really beneficial,
[00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:48.160]   because you're not going to have impact if you have size to do.
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:50.760]   But if that name gets added to an index in six months,
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:53.160]   when the volume has kind of dropped off,
[00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:55.160]   you potentially could have a lot of impact.
[00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:57.600]   So Chris adds within five days.
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:59.440]   And then some of the other index providers,
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:01.400]   you might have to wait until the next rebalance.
[00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:05.480]   And now it might be December before an IPO would get added.
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:10.520]   2023, 2022, relatively quiet times on syndicate and IPO.
[00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:16.680]   Back in 2022, we participated in over 400 syndicate offerings
[00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:19.760]   and added over $350 million worth of value
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:22.400]   added to the portfolios by participating
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:24.840]   in syndicate and IPOs.
[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:27.680]   So I want to understand this.
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:31.320]   When an IPO is coming out, you get the roadshow.
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:40.760]   And Vanguard, can you buy on the IPO at the IPO price Vanguard?
[00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:44.960]   But does it go into index funds, or does it go somewhere else?
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:45.880]   No, good question.
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:50.640]   So if it's a large IPO that it's getting added in five days,
[00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:53.160]   we will potentially go in for a piece of it.
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:54.120]   In the fund itself?
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:55.080]   In the fund itself.
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:55.800]   Even before it's in the index?
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:57.460]   It has not been added to the index yet.
[00:25:57.460 --> 00:26:00.280]   Now, we know it's going to be added in five days.
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:02.640]   Now, do we go in for the full amount?
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:03.440]   Absolutely not.
[00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:05.440]   We might go in for a small portion of our order
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:06.920]   and take advantage of the IPO price.
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:10.120]   Now, it's not an automatic, hey, there's an IPO coming.
[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:11.560]   You guys are going to go in on it.
[00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:14.560]   We do analysis of it to see how many times oversubscribed
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:15.600]   it might be.
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:18.760]   If it's an IPO that feels like it's going to be a little flat,
[00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:20.380]   we're not going to have any part of it.
[00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:22.800]   But if it's multiple times oversubscribed,
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:24.880]   then we have the ability to go in on the IPO.
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:26.760]   We will go in for a portion of our order,
[00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:28.300]   knowing that the bulk of our order
[00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:29.920]   is going to be bought in five days time
[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:31.240]   when it goes into the index.
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:33.200]   But wasn't this active management?
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:35.160]   No.
[00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:39.000]   We see this as a value-add strategy,
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.720]   as long as it's done in a risk-controlled manner.
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:46.000]   But nice try, Rick.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.120]   Well, I was always wondering about big IPOs.
[00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:49.960]   I know they're going to go into the index.
[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:52.800]   And I know that a lot of them pop
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:56.080]   as soon as they start trading in the secondary market.
[00:26:56.080 --> 00:27:00.960]   And I was like, gee, are we able to participate in that
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:03.880]   through indexing, even though they're not in the index set?
[00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:07.200]   And your answer is, sometimes, at the discretion of Vanguard.
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:08.560]   Right, and it would be--
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:11.440]   I mean, sometimes, you could put in for a large order.
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:14.520]   You might get a very tiny piece of what you're looking for,
[00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:16.040]   just because of it.
[00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:18.200]   But yeah, you do have the ability to go in on them,
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:19.360]   especially if they're getting at it.
[00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:21.960]   Now, if an IPO is not getting at it for three or four months,
[00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:23.560]   that's a whole different story.
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:25.480]   Well, let me ask a question about this, then.
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:27.720]   So you're going to get a share of the IPO
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:31.000]   that you know is probably going to pop, and you like it.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.320]   It's oversubscribed by however many times
[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:37.400]   it needs to be oversubscribed for you to like it.
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:40.960]   But you have all these different funds out there.
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:44.360]   How do you decide who gets it?
[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:46.480]   Yeah, so we prorate it, basically.
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:46.980]   Oh, you do.
[00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:49.320]   You do prorate it across all of the-- so for example,
[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:52.360]   if it's crisp, and we know it's getting at it in five days,
[00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:54.640]   we're going to know, based on the size of the company,
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:57.160]   is it going to be small, is it going to be mid?
[00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:00.040]   And based on that, the good thing about total stock
[00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:01.920]   is it's almost involved in every one of them,
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:03.880]   because it is the entire market.
[00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:09.240]   But in terms of total stock, if it's small cap, small growth,
[00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:10.700]   they all get a portion of it.
[00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:11.200]   It all gets--
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:12.120]   Based on the size of the fund?
[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:13.760]   Based on the size of the fund and the weight in the end.
[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:14.520]   Yeah.
[00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:15.360]   All right.
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:19.760]   Well, you know, I know you use some derivatives
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:20.440]   during the day.
[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:23.120]   Like, at the end of the day, you have a lot of cash.
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:24.960]   You need to equitize that cash.
[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:29.200]   Talk with us about how you might use the futures markets
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:35.240]   versus the cash markets to square up your portfolio,
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:37.000]   if you will, by the end of the day.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.520]   So futures are incredibly helpful.
[00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:45.640]   Now, I would say, ideally, we hold no more than maybe 30,
[00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:49.680]   35 basis points worth of futures in total stock market.
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:52.920]   And the reason we use futures is multiple reasons.
[00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:56.240]   Number one, when stocks go ex-dividend--
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:57.880]   so say, for example, today is a Monday,
[00:28:57.880 --> 00:28:59.960]   and a stock goes ex-dividend tonight,
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:02.160]   we need to spend that ex-dividend amount
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:02.760]   on the close.
[00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:04.260]   And some days in total stock market,
[00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:06.400]   that can be $200, $300 million worth
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:09.240]   of names in the portfolio that are going ex-dividend.
[00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:11.200]   We need to spend that.
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:13.640]   The difference between ex-date and payable date
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:15.680]   can sometimes be two, three weeks.
[00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:17.320]   So it goes ex-today.
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:19.320]   We don't get paid for three weeks.
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:21.680]   If we had no futures in the fund,
[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:23.280]   and we spent the ex-dividend, it's
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:25.000]   no different than if you guys spent money
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.540]   you didn't have in your bank account.
[00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:27.960]   You get hit with overdraft charges.
[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:30.260]   And when rates were zero, overdraft charges
[00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:31.600]   were no big deal, right?
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:35.160]   But now that rates are 5%, 5.5%, the banks are coming back
[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:36.600]   and say, hey, you overdraft.
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:38.680]   Here's what you owe us, because you spent money
[00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:40.120]   that you didn't have in your account.
[00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:42.620]   The beauty of the futures is that they kind of give you
[00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:47.640]   a cash cushion in your fund that allows
[00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:49.800]   you to spend the dividends without overdrafting.
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:51.560]   So that's one of the nice things about it.
[00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:53.440]   The other thing is that, believe it or not,
[00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:56.920]   we get calls at 358 to say, you either have cash
[00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:59.360]   in or out of your portfolio.
[00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:01.760]   It's physically not possible to generate a trade list
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:04.000]   and get it down to the floor in two minutes.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.640]   Who do the calls come from?
[00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:10.040]   Within Vanguard, we have a large transaction area.
[00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:14.040]   So any institution maybe that was bringing cash in,
[00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:15.280]   it would get funneled through.
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:17.160]   And then we would get notified, hey--
[00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:18.720]   And you wouldn't get notified until two minutes
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:19.480]   before the market closes.
[00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:20.180]   It has happened.
[00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:21.680]   Now, do we ask for that?
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:24.680]   No, we say, hey, listen, please let us know by 3 o'clock.
[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:26.400]   But it does happen.
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:28.960]   If it's a large purchase into the portfolio,
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:30.280]   we have the right to reject it.
[00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:32.240]   If we don't think we can equitize it in time
[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:34.080]   and get it in, we have the right to say no.
[00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:36.760]   We cannot say no to a redemption,
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:38.520]   so a redemption we have to honor.
[00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:41.140]   So if we had a redemption in a fund,
[00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:43.440]   one of the nice things about having futures in the fund
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:45.120]   that we can sell futures.
[00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:47.440]   So I can sell the futures to fund that redemption that
[00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:49.840]   was called in late in the day.
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:52.200]   We also use futures if you're just trading
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:54.560]   and you have a rebalance where you have buys and sells,
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:56.400]   and you're trying to stay market neutral.
[00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:57.860]   If one side gets ahead of the other,
[00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:01.920]   say your buys are very liquid, your sells are not so liquid,
[00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:03.600]   you can sell futures to keep yourself
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:05.720]   dollar neutral in terms of trading in the market.
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:10.920]   So they are a great tool to have in terms of trading.
[00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:14.640]   But it is a small portion of the overall holdings in the fund.
[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:16.920]   So it sounds like you've got a busy day.
[00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:19.680]   What I'd like you to do, if you could, for us,
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:24.840]   is walk through a typical day.
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:26.520]   You get in in the morning, or maybe you've
[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:29.000]   thought about it on the way in.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.400]   What does your day look like from when you get in,
[00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:35.360]   what time you get in, all the way through until you leave
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:37.240]   at whatever time you leave?
[00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:42.040]   Yeah, so one of the ways that you have really tight tracking
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:45.880]   is to make sure that you're 100% invested at all times.
[00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:48.160]   In addition to having the exact weights in your fund
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:50.360]   to the benchmark, you need to make sure
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:52.320]   that your fund, you're sitting on--
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:55.320]   when you come in in the morning, in an ideal situation,
[00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:58.200]   your fund says zero in terms of your liquidity.
[00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:00.040]   It never happens.
[00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:01.960]   You're either sitting on $10 or $15 million,
[00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:03.080]   or you're over-invested.
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:06.920]   So the first thing you do is tie out all of the activity that
[00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:08.120]   got processed overnight.
[00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:10.280]   Does it make sense that my fund is sitting where
[00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:11.840]   it should be in the morning?
[00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:14.880]   And I will sign off on that as the portfolio manager.
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:16.720]   And then we have someone from our risk area
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:17.840]   that will sign off on that.
[00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:20.160]   And then we have somebody on the desk
[00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:24.600]   that is basically overseas, a desk supervisor,
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:27.240]   to make sure that all of the index changes,
[00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:28.480]   all of the cash flow is got.
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:30.520]   So there's three sets of eyes that will sign off
[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:31.920]   on my portfolios in the morning.
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:35.880]   That's generally completed by about 9 o'clock, 9:15.
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:38.480]   Before I even get in, there is a team
[00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:41.600]   from our data team that pulls in all the indexes from all
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:43.200]   the different index providers.
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:45.480]   And they make sure that the indexes that I'm looking at
[00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:48.920]   on my screen when I log in are exactly the same indexes
[00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:51.120]   that CRISP is giving out, that S&P is giving out,
[00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:53.080]   so that we know that, foundationally, we're
[00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:54.400]   tracking the right benchmark.
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:56.680]   And there are numerous corporate actions,
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:58.920]   splits, reverse splits, all kinds
[00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:01.320]   of things that might be happening that those indexes
[00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:02.200]   need to account for.
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:04.200]   And making sure that our indexes are good
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:06.160]   is really, really important.
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:11.520]   So when we tie out everything by 9 o'clock, 9:15, market opens.
[00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:14.440]   And then we start thinking about what's happening today.
[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:17.240]   And so we have notifications that come out
[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:20.200]   from CRISP, from S&P, from FTSE, from Russell, saying, hey,
[00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:23.560]   here are index changes that are happening on the close tonight.
[00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:25.600]   And our goal then, Rick, will be to make sure
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:27.560]   that we position those portfolios to make sure
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:31.200]   that at 4 o'clock, our funds are identical to the index.
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:32.960]   Any index changes that are happening,
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:35.560]   any syndicate offerings that might have happened overnight,
[00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:37.280]   we factor those in.
[00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:40.360]   Any Dutch tenders, any kind of corporate actions,
[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:44.160]   all of that over the course of the day is--
[00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:45.880]   we'll have meetings about--
[00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:50.360]   we do a-- we generally will have one person on the desk
[00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:54.040]   becomes kind of the quarterback for a particular index change.
[00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:56.280]   So all of the information where brokers are calling us
[00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:59.160]   to say, hey, we know there's an increase in the shares tonight.
[00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:00.400]   We have a seller of this name.
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:02.120]   You funnel that all to whoever happens
[00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:04.680]   to be the trader that is responsible for that.
[00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:07.080]   So that person kind of becomes the expert.
[00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:10.160]   And before you know it, it's 9:30, and all of a sudden,
[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:13.200]   it's 3:30, and we're getting ready to send trade lists down
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:15.040]   to the floor.
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:17.080]   And in between, we'll have meetings.
[00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:19.800]   We have-- I'm on a number of committees.
[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:21.600]   For example, ITAC committees with New York,
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:24.560]   with NASDAQ, market structure-type issues
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:27.400]   that might be coming up over the course of a day.
[00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:30.640]   So there's-- it's incredibly--
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:33.200]   no day-- no two days are the same.
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:35.200]   So even though there might be things
[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:36.680]   that you think you have to do when you come into work,
[00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:38.560]   like I mentioned yesterday with Activision,
[00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:39.360]   that was unexpected.
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:42.040]   I think most people thought it was going to close next week.
[00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:45.480]   But all of a sudden, yesterday I come in, and we have 20 of us
[00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:47.760]   huddled around the table at 8 o'clock in the morning,
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:51.200]   figure out, how do we handle this index change tonight?
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:53.920]   And what are the repercussions across all our portfolios?
[00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:56.360]   And before you know it, you're getting ready to trade at 3
[00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:58.040]   o'clock.
[00:34:58.040 --> 00:34:58.880]   Well, I'm going to--
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:01.160]   I have one more question, but before I do that,
[00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:03.160]   if people in the audience have questions--
[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:04.520]   Mel, where's Mel?
[00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:05.120]   Mel?
[00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:06.720]   There's Mel.
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:09.280]   You could hand your question that you have.
[00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:10.920]   Just write it down on a piece of paper.
[00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:16.000]   Hand it to Mel, because we do have 10 minutes for Q&A
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.280]   at the end from the audience.
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:18.400]   So there is Mel.
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:19.920]   He can get up.
[00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:20.800]   Mel, get up.
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:23.280]   And walk around.
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:24.600]   And hand him your question.
[00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:27.880]   OK, so here we go with the last question.
[00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:31.640]   You know, indexing is an evil, evil thing.
[00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:33.640]   At least that's what the media says.
[00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:37.080]   It's worse than Marxism, I understand.
[00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:40.400]   I mean, you control the universe, right?
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:44.400]   I mean, you could bring down the entire financial system.
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:46.440]   But what do you say to these critics?
[00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:52.800]   Well, I would say, listen, think about all of the benefits
[00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:54.920]   that indexing has brought to investors.
[00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:59.000]   I think since 1993 up through 2021,
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.800]   I think I've seen estimates.
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:05.480]   Mike shared with me $334 billion worth of savings to investors
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:09.040]   when you compare the expense ratios of index funds
[00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:13.160]   versus some of the more higher active funds.
[00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:16.360]   So incredible benefits.
[00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:18.520]   There are just so many advantages
[00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:22.080]   that I see with indexing in terms of the low cost,
[00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:25.000]   the low turnover, helping people save.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.260]   I mean, I've had so many good conversations, probably
[00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:28.640]   with some of the people in this audience,
[00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:31.920]   when bogleheads used to come, when you would come to campus,
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:35.120]   about people telling me, hey, I worked in this job
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:37.000]   for whatever number of years.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.080]   And I put money away, and I've been in total stock.
[00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:40.160]   I've been in index 500.
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:41.360]   I've been in your total bond.
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:43.200]   I've been in your total international.
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:46.160]   And I'm going to be retiring at 52 years of age.
[00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:48.960]   And I can't tell you how good that feels.
[00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:50.440]   So it does irk me a little bit when
[00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:52.360]   I hear people bashing indexing.
[00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:54.920]   Because I look at all the benefits that it's brought.
[00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:57.360]   And listen, we have all the assets
[00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:58.600]   that you talked about, Rick.
[00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:01.600]   But at the end of the day, it's this audience.
[00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:03.200]   It's your money that we are managing.
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:05.120]   And we are incredibly privileged to be
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:08.280]   in a position to manage the money for investors like you.
[00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:10.000]   And we have 50 million shareholders
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.960]   that we take that incredibly seriously.
[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:17.840]   The argument-- I've heard that indexing,
[00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:20.400]   it doesn't really contribute to price discovery.
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:24.440]   So that potentially, you would say, well,
[00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:27.920]   if there are disparities in price,
[00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:30.080]   it should be a gold mine for active managers.
[00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:33.280]   It should be so much easier for you to outperform.
[00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:34.320]   And we haven't seen that.
[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:36.960]   It's incredibly difficult to outperform the markets.
[00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:38.040]   It's a zero-sum game.
[00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:39.560]   For every dollar that outperforms
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:40.720]   is a dollar underperforming.
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:43.400]   And when you factor in cost, it's just incredibly difficult
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:44.520]   to outperform.
[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:47.200]   And I think a lot of these articles that have come out
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:52.520]   bashing indexing, I think if you dug a few layers,
[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:54.280]   if you peeled a few layers, I think
[00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:56.440]   you'd find that there are people probably not happy
[00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:59.160]   that they're losing money.
[00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:00.640]   You look at the cash flows.
[00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:04.600]   Investors understand, if we look at where the net cash flows
[00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:10.160]   have come, it's to that lowest quartile of expenses.
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:13.160]   $1.5 trillion has come in since the '90s,
[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:15.880]   whereas if you look at the two, three, and four quartiles
[00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:18.920]   in terms of expenses, that has been a net outflow
[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:20.280]   of $1.6 trillion.
[00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:24.240]   So investors understand that, as Mr. Bogle used to say,
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:27.400]   you get what you don't pay for, right?
[00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:30.600]   So we're very proud of what we have.
[00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:33.040]   We understand what a privileged position
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:37.480]   we have to manage money for 50 million-odd investors.
[00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:40.760]   And yeah, we think indexing has a long way to go.
[00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:41.400]   Yeah, Rick.
[00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:44.280]   So while Mel is making his way up to the podium--
[00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:47.360]   Make your way up to the podium, Mel.
[00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:49.720]   Got one last question.
[00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:51.800]   You told me this in an interview that I did with you
[00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:53.600]   on the Bogle Heads on Investing podcast
[00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:56.400]   that it's a misnomer that index funds are
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:57.360]   doing a lot of trading.
[00:38:57.360 --> 00:38:59.520]   In fact, you trade very little amount
[00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:02.480]   of the shares that are actually traded on a daily basis.
[00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:03.800]   Could you just hit on that one?
[00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:04.800]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:06.960]   So if you look just a normal day,
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:10.640]   probably index strategies account for less than 5%
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:13.000]   of the trading that's out there.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.360]   Even yesterday, when I mentioned Activision--
[00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:19.240]   and let's say Total Stock wasn't the only fund that was trading,
[00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:21.280]   but maybe in total, our desk might have traded
[00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:25.120]   around $3 billion yesterday.
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:28.320]   That sounds like a ton of money, and it is.
[00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:31.520]   But over the entire stock market,
[00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:35.360]   if you look at what traded yesterday for stocks
[00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:39.840]   and for ETFs, it's probably in the $600 to $700 billion.
[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:43.840]   So that $3 billion is less than half a percent
[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:45.920]   of the average volume.
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:49.000]   So one of the really good things about indexing, Rick,
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.400]   and we talked about it on your podcast, was the low turnover.
[00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:54.520]   So even Total Stock, which is, as you mentioned,
[00:39:54.520 --> 00:40:00.000]   the largest fund, when I have rebalances, they're small.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.360]   So the total turnover is less than 10%.
[00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:05.920]   So turnover is the average assets.
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:08.520]   If you look at the lesser of buys and sells
[00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:10.800]   divided by the average assets in the fund,
[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:13.600]   it tends to be below 10% a year.
[00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:18.160]   Active managers, you can have turnover 70%, 80%.
[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:20.080]   And believe me, that's not a tailwind.
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:22.720]   When you're turning over a portfolio like that,
[00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:28.680]   you're incurring transaction costs, commissions, taxes.
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:32.600]   And we really don't trade unless we have to trade.
[00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:35.480]   And so one of the beauties of indexing
[00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:38.080]   is the fact, Rick, that you do have such low turnover,
[00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:39.800]   incredibly tax efficient.
[00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:44.720]   And it's a tough benchmark to outperform.
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:47.000]   I got a lot of questions in a lot of different areas.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.440]   I will say that I'm just going to ask Jerry the questions that
[00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:54.600]   actually pertain to him.
[00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:58.320]   Questions like, will this be available by Vanguard?
[00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:01.920]   Or is Vanguard going to start offering this fund or that fund?
[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:03.600]   He wouldn't know, honestly.
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:05.760]   And I'm not going to do that.
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:10.760]   So I'm kind of trying to stick with his area here.
[00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:17.960]   So first of all, do you also, on your desk,
[00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:20.560]   do international stocks?
[00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:23.720]   So the way our desk-- we have about 25 people on the desk.
[00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:26.560]   And it's roughly 13 on the domestic side
[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:27.760]   and 12 on the international.
[00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:30.920]   So we kind of have dollar, which is the side that I'm on.
[00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:32.640]   And then we have non-dollar, which
[00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:35.800]   people like Mike Perry and Jeff Miller and Christine
[00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:37.920]   Franquan are the people who would
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:40.160]   focus on the international side of things.
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:42.080]   And that side of the desk does a ton
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:45.560]   of work with our trading desks in London
[00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:46.720]   and also in Australia.
[00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:49.120]   So if they have European names that they're trading,
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:52.160]   they're sending those to the London desk and trading.
[00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:55.080]   And we have about 12 traders in London,
[00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:57.160]   similar amount of traders in Melbourne.
[00:41:57.160 --> 00:42:00.120]   And the Melbourne traders, those guys
[00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:02.640]   would trade all of the Asia-Pac names that we're trading.
[00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:06.540]   So over the course, we have this concept
[00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:08.440]   of kind of past the book.
[00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:11.880]   So we'll generate a trade list in Melbourne,
[00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:14.440]   send it out to our Melbourne desk.
[00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:15.960]   They will trade the Asia-Pac names.
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:17.500]   When they're done trading that, they
[00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:21.640]   will pass it on to the European desk in the UK.
[00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:22.480]   Europe is done.
[00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:24.320]   They will send it back to us.
[00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:26.000]   And the international side of the desk
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.160]   then will trade Canada, LATAM, those types
[00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:29.560]   names in a global portfolio.
[00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:31.080]   So we do have an international side.
[00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:32.380]   I just don't happen to be on that side.
[00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:33.380]   I'm on the domestic side.
[00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:39.360]   And on the international side, do they
[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:42.020]   go through the same process that you go through on the US side,
[00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:43.820]   as far as when they're trading and so forth?
[00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:44.320]   Yeah.
[00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:45.960]   I mean, they would interact.
[00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:48.600]   There's probably more trading done on the domestic side,
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:50.000]   because on the international side,
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.560]   they're generating trade lists.
[00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:53.520]   But then they're sending the trade lists
[00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:56.680]   to the desk, to the local coverage in London
[00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:59.000]   for European names and for Asia-Pac.
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:00.680]   But the concepts would be the same.
[00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:02.220]   The risk metrics, all that kind of stuff
[00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:03.200]   would be very, very similar.
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:03.400]   Yeah.
[00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:04.680]   So this, I know, is not in your area.
[00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:05.680]   But I'm going to ask it.
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:15.400]   It has to do with voting proxies and Vanguard, BlackRock,
[00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:20.400]   State Street, all being the big three.
[00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:22.040]   When you're out there trading stocks,
[00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:24.880]   do you run into BlackRock trying to do the same thing
[00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:27.280]   and State Street trying to do the same thing?
[00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:29.240]   There's three big index providers out there.
[00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:31.360]   And you're all trying to jockey for the same stocks
[00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:32.480]   at the same time.
[00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:33.920]   Do you see those trades out there?
[00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:36.040]   I mean, how does that affect your trading?
[00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:37.900]   Well, if you think--
[00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:39.360]   so I'll give you an example, Rick.
[00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:41.760]   So we mentioned Activision last night, right?
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:43.880]   So it got deleted.
[00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:47.560]   S&P announced that they are going
[00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:52.360]   to replace Activision in the 500 next Tuesday by Lululemon.
[00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:54.020]   So there's going to be lots of Lululemon
[00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:55.080]   that need to be bought.
[00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:56.960]   And we know that it's probably net.
[00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:59.400]   If you factor in all the folks that you mentioned,
[00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:00.820]   Vanguard, BlackRock, State Street,
[00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:02.960]   everyone else that manages 500, there's
[00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:05.640]   probably 18 million-odd shares of Lululemon
[00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:07.720]   that will need to be bought.
[00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:11.240]   Now, brokers make a living out of predicting
[00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:13.640]   which names they think is going to be added to the index.
[00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:18.120]   So Lululemon has been on the list for probably a year now.
[00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:21.680]   We know that, in total, we know how much needs to be bought.
[00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:25.140]   And we will put together a strategy on Monday morning
[00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:27.680]   about, of the total that needs to be bought,
[00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:29.300]   we know what we represent.
[00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:30.840]   And we can look at the volume numbers
[00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:33.720]   and start to see, OK, it looks like there's
[00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:37.880]   people that are starting to front run the order,
[00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:41.160]   try and get ahead of the indexing demand for Tuesday.
[00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:43.200]   And some of those may be competitors.
[00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:45.240]   Some of those might be hedge funds.
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:48.120]   And all of that gets built into the strategy in terms of,
[00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:50.720]   how are we going to buy Lululemon for our 500
[00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:51.880]   portfolios?
[00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:54.000]   But yeah, you're fully aware of it's
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.360]   all out there in terms of the holdings and the assets.
[00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:59.880]   So we know, as they know what we have to buy.
[00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:02.040]   And then it just comes down to the desk itself
[00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:05.520]   in terms of the traders, the experience, the strategies.
[00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:08.680]   And we feel really good about the position that we're in.
[00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:09.720]   I've been on the desk.
[00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:13.040]   I've been at Vanguard 31, on the desk about 28.
[00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:14.920]   Don Butler is about the same.
[00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:18.280]   We have probably-- we understand the different strategies
[00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:19.960]   involved.
[00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:23.720]   And it's our goal to make sure that when a name like Lululemon
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:25.760]   gets added, that we do it in a way
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:29.480]   that we feel we can potentially add a little bit of value
[00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:32.320]   add to the portfolios, but making sure, above all,
[00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:34.560]   that we track the benchmark closely.
[00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:36.800]   And on that point, I've noticed that you're actually
[00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:39.680]   able to make up some of the basis points.
[00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:42.040]   In other words, if the ETF is three basis points,
[00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:43.640]   you actually outperform.
[00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:46.240]   Yeah, so this year, year to date, I think we're--
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:47.680]   More active management, by the way.
[00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:49.520]   Go ahead.
[00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:52.720]   I think-- so if you think about it,
[00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:54.440]   we would call it value add, right?
[00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:57.440]   So if you think about it, so the expense ratio on VTI
[00:45:57.440 --> 00:45:58.880]   is three basis points.
[00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:02.080]   The value add, year to date, is about 3 and 1/2.
[00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:03.960]   And so it's a combination of some
[00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:05.240]   of the things we talked about.
[00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:06.600]   Some of it is syndicate.
[00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:09.480]   Some of it is complex corporate actions.
[00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:12.040]   For example, there was one large one a few weeks ago.
[00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:15.280]   Johnson & Johnson spun off KVUE.
[00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:18.520]   We were able to handle that action in such a way
[00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:22.320]   that we added $190 million to the funds in terms
[00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:26.680]   of how we handled the spinoff, how we elected shares,
[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:28.360]   and how we traded around it.
[00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:30.840]   That moved the dial a little on some port--
[00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:33.080]   not quite a basis point in total stock,
[00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:36.840]   but somewhere between 0.6, 0.7 of a basis point.
[00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:41.880]   So those types of strategies.
[00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:43.400]   Also, our SEC lending.
[00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:45.240]   Our SEC lending is securities lending.
[00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:48.560]   So you think about a broker wants to short a stock.
[00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:49.680]   They need to get a locate.
[00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:51.840]   They'll come to a company like Vanguard and say, hey,
[00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:53.980]   can we borrow x number of shares?
[00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:56.160]   And they will give us collateral.
[00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:58.320]   We then can invest that collateral.
[00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:00.640]   And sometimes it's incredibly lucrative.
[00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:05.360]   So you're probably familiar with AMC movie theaters.
[00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:08.720]   They had a complex corporate action going on this year
[00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:13.600]   that everyone was looking to borrow AMC to the tune
[00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:18.840]   of it added some massive amounts of money to our shareholders.
[00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:20.880]   Now, we're a little different, I think,
[00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:23.880]   in that our securities lending, it
[00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:26.200]   cost a certain amount of dollars for that group to run.
[00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:29.720]   But all of the money that comes in through SEC lending,
[00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:31.800]   take out whatever it takes to run that group.
[00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:33.600]   The rest of that money goes directly
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:35.400]   to the funds that loaned it out.
[00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:39.120]   There's no company or management company
[00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:41.600]   keeping a portion of that to make sure their stock price
[00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:42.760]   remains at a certain level.
[00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:44.680]   It goes directly back to the shareholders.
[00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:47.200]   So you have a situation where, in total stock,
[00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:48.660]   close to two basis points this year
[00:47:48.660 --> 00:47:51.560]   has come from SEC lending.
[00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:55.280]   Extended market, it's 15 basis points
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:56.440]   has come from SEC lending.
[00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:58.000]   A lot of it is related to that AMC
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.400]   because it was so lucrative.
[00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:03.840]   But that group, this year, has brought in over $1 billion
[00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:06.160]   to Vanguard in terms of loaning out securities.
[00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:09.320]   And that money has gone back to help offset the expense ratio.
[00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:10.760]   100% less the cost of the group.
[00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:11.560]   Less the cost, yes.
[00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:13.640]   Which is different than other index fund providers
[00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:16.200]   where they keep 50% of it.
[00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:19.080]   You only give the shareholders 50%.
[00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:22.200]   And so in the end, I made this comment yesterday in another--
[00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:24.840]   I said beta is free.
[00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:26.320]   Beta is free.
[00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:28.040]   And you're confirming that.
[00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:29.960]   Yeah, I mean, if you own VTI this year,
[00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:31.880]   in fact, you're getting a free lunch.
[00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:32.480]   Free lunch.
[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:32.980]   Yeah.
[00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:35.080]   Well, thank you.
[00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:37.780]   I think that's all the time we have.
[00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:38.480]   Thank you, Jerry.
