[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.260]   - But you say, "Hey, we're going over so-and-so's house."
[00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.220]   And they say, "You know, I don't like their kids."
[00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:08.060]   And you go, "Well, listen,
[00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:09.100]   "you gotta learn to play with other kids."
[00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.360]   And you go, "No, I don't like their kids."
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.740]   And you say, "Did something happen?"
[00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.700]   And so we're not talking about a dangerous situation.
[00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.240]   Really like, "No, I don't like them.
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.140]   "I just really wanna just stay home."
[00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.000]   - Yeah, this is a great-
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.940]   - So are we gonna impinge on their,
[00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.420]   I mean, 'cause we're teaching them,
[00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.260]   either way, we're teaching them something.
[00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.060]   You gotta do stuff you don't wanna do,
[00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.380]   even if you don't like it.
[00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.220]   And we're here again, we're ruling out the possibility
[00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.460]   that there's something unsafe about the environment,
[00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.920]   psychologically or physically unsafe.
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.660]   Or, but at the same time, we're teaching them,
[00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.200]   "Hey, I see you, I hear you,
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.940]   "but your desires might not be right."
[00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.700]   There's actually a tacit message of the way you feel
[00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.660]   might not be the best gauge of what's best for you,
[00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.020]   which sends a complicated message to a kid.
[00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.860]   - Totally.
[00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.940]   So this is, again, where I think at Good Inside,
[00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.660]   family jobs are so useful.
[00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.340]   Family jobs, to me, when I used to meet with parents,
[00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.780]   and they'd describe a situation,
[00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.180]   I feel like 90% of the time, that's where I'd start.
[00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.260]   Because then that flows from there.
[00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.100]   It's like a framework.
[00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.740]   So wait, what is my job?
[00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.100]   I'm the one who sets boundaries.
[00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.420]   I am the one who makes key family decisions.
[00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.700]   Obviously, as our kids get older,
[00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.340]   they should be making some decisions, too.
[00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.460]   No one likes to feel controlled.
[00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.080]   But key decisions, and my job,
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.400]   is to validate my kids' experience.
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.340]   This is actually complicated, because again,
[00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.200]   over and over, we think that validating my kids' experience
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.140]   means they're gonna dictate a decision.
[00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.420]   My boundaries don't dictate my kids' feelings,
[00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.860]   and my kids' feelings should not dictate my boundaries.
[00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.020]   They're just two equal things.
[00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.020]   So this is a great example.
[00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.340]   My kids are like, you know I don't like
[00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.940]   playing with those kids, and can I just stay home?
[00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.420]   Let's just say grandma was home.
[00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.500]   Can I just stay home?
[00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.420]   I'm like, I just think it's important to go as a family,
[00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.740]   but my kid doesn't wanna go.
[00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:46.620]   There's nothing dangerous.
[00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.780]   Okay, to me, this is that exact way
[00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.460]   of putting family jobs into action, sweetie.
[00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.740]   And to me, this phrase, I wish every parent
[00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.620]   could say this to their kid, I believe you.
[00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.660]   If you wanna make a kid feel real and confident for life,
[00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.540]   confidence comes from the experience of being believed,
[00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.140]   'cause that's how you, for me, confidence is self-trust.
[00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.980]   It's not feeling good about yourself, it's self-trust.
[00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.820]   I really do know the way I feel.
[00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.140]   So let's say I say to my son in that situation,
[00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.260]   it's, I believe you.
[00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.460]   I'd start with, I believe you.
[00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.020]   Look, I know you wanna play football all day,
[00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.940]   and the kid around your age hates football.
[00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.220]   Like that would probably be lowest on your list
[00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.340]   of types of kids you'd wanna hang out with
[00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.160]   for the afternoon.
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.760]   I totally believe you.
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:35.020]   And in this family, we know that sometimes
[00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.060]   we have to do things we don't love to do.
[00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.920]   We do that for a family experience.
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.100]   I say this to my kid all the time.
[00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.780]   You know, also just to end up being a good adult,
[00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.900]   you just have to end up practicing as a kid,
[00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.180]   doing things you don't wanna do,
[00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.180]   things that are boring, things that aren't your preference.
[00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.420]   So, you know, you notch in your belt for that.
[00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.380]   So you don't have to thank me.
[00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.020]   And also, I know you have it in you
[00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.460]   to do your best, to be polite and engaged.
[00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.380]   Like I just, I know you're a good kid
[00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.540]   and this isn't what you want,
[00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.120]   and I know we're gonna get through it.
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.300]   Now, if it's really hard, maybe young,
[00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.900]   hey, let's create a sign.
[00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.500]   Like, can you look at me and go,
[00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.720]   when you feel like you're kind of at this,
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.580]   and then me and you, we're gonna go to the bathroom,
[00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.220]   I'm gonna give you a hug and, right?
[00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.100]   I'm gonna say, I know this isn't what you want.
[00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.140]   And when we get home, we could watch that football game,
[00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.060]   whatever it was, right?
[00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.180]   Because what we often do
[00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.340]   is we leave ourselves with two choices with kids.
[00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.580]   We either say, fine, stay home.
[00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.620]   Their feelings actually just dictated the decision.
[00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.160]   That's not helpful for them.
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.100]   I don't want my kid to learn in life.
[00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.580]   When I don't wanna do something,
[00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.660]   people twist and turn to make that thing not happen.
[00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.380]   Like that's disturbing for adulthood expectations.
[00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:39.460]   But then we do the other thing,
[00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.340]   which is like, you are so selfish.
[00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.100]   Just because you don't have a friend your age
[00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.700]   doesn't mean that you can't come with us.
[00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.620]   So we either let their feelings dictate,
[00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.380]   or we think our boundaries kind of give us the right
[00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.260]   to be mad at our kid, right?
[00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.860]   Like to do both is so important.
[00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.180]   And so that's where I think to me when I hear impingement,
[00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.260]   like, I actually think that is the exact space
[00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.180]   where you have the most bang for your buck as a parent.
[00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.500]   Like, it's not enjoyable.
[00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.000]   And again, if I have my beautiful intervention with my son,
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.180]   do not think my kid will look at me and say,
[00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.380]   I love how you explained that.
[00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:14.380]   That was so beautiful.
[00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.040]   No, he's gonna roll his eyes.
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.280]   My job is not to take the bait, 'cause I'm an adult,
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.940]   and to also hold hope.
[00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.060]   I think that's really important.
[00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.020]   This concept of I'm validating my kid's feelings
[00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.420]   where they are today,
[00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.380]   but I need to be the one to hold hope
[00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:31.880]   that they can cope with it.
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:32.860]   If I can't name to my kid,
[00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.540]   I know you're gonna get through it.
[00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.940]   They're not gonna be able to see that kind of next,
[00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.180]   more mature version of themselves.
[00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.540]   And I actually think it's the same as your best boss.
[00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:42.500]   You know, it's like,
[00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:43.940]   I know you don't wanna go on this trip.
[00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:44.780]   I don't know, whatever it is.
[00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.560]   I know this presentation topic
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.160]   isn't the one you would have chosen.
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.720]   And there were 10 things, and this was literally number 10.
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.600]   I totally get that, and it stinks,
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.600]   and I'm not taking anything away from that.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.640]   And this is the thing I need you to do.
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.200]   And I know something about you.
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.120]   Like, when you put your mind to something,
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.560]   you always do a great job.
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.520]   And like, it's probably not gonna be enjoyable,
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.840]   but I do know you're gonna do a great job on this.
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.200]   Like, that's like the boss you want.
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.040]   - Amazing.
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.680]   Are you adopting children, by the way?
[00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.260]   - I actually, I finished college.
[00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:17.100]   I actually, I ride with them.
[00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.000]   - You I consider, Andrew, you, adult children.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.900]   - What I'm hearing is don't dictate their behavior with,
[00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.060]   and I'm gonna underline in bold, dictate.
[00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.420]   Don't dictate their behavior.
[00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:32.140]   You're going to do this because I said so.
[00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.140]   That's dictatorship.
[00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:35.500]   But at the same time,
[00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.780]   don't quash the emotion behind the resistance.
[00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.980]   Kind of acknowledge it, make them feel real.
[00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.000]   I believe you.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.800]   I love this phrase, amazing.
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.160]   And I love your definition of confidence.
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.160]   If people didn't hear that,
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.520]   we're definitely gonna repeat it again.
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.640]   And we're gonna etch it into your neural circuitry
[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.160]   'cause I love that.
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.320]   It's a self-trust.
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.980]   - Yes.
[00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.480]   - And this notion of giving hope.
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.240]   You're giving them an incentive
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.400]   that's based on a reward that's actually good for them,
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.140]   that they can translate to other situations as well.
[00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.380]   Wow.
[00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.240]   So much there. - Can I double-click
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.080]   on reward? - Please.
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:15.900]   - Because you know what it made me think?
[00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.120]   I didn't think until you said that.
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.740]   I think in a situation where you'd be tempted to say,
[00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.140]   and if you go and you're polite,
[00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:25.340]   I'll give you 20 extra minutes of Roblox, right?
[00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.780]   First of all, let me just say something.
[00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:31.580]   Whatever I say to you, for listeners,
[00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:32.500]   it's not like I do this stuff
[00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:33.820]   all the time with my actual kids.
[00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.140]   I'm the first one sometimes to be like,
[00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:36.500]   here's your thing I have to dangle.
[00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.500]   - We'll provide a little section in the comment section
[00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:39.580]   on YouTube where your kids can,
[00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:40.700]   no, I'm just kidding. - Yeah, exactly.
[00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:41.580]   - Your kids are forbidden.
[00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:44.100]   No, wait, that's, wait, that's dictating.
[00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.380]   We understand why you,
[00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:47.980]   I believe that you would want to comment,
[00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:49.280]   but we're going to trust,
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.740]   we're going to let you know why it's,
[00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:51.700]   it's good for you if you don't.
[00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:53.660]   Anyway, I'll practice this on someone else's kids.
[00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:55.420]   - But the reward, like the reward,
[00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:59.640]   when your kid ends up seeing themself
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.540]   capable of doing something
[00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.980]   they didn't previously think they could do,
[00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:05.820]   you know better than me,
[00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:08.980]   like I feel like that is like one of the best rewards,
[00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:11.580]   even if it's getting through a social situation.
[00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:13.260]   Or I think about this a lot with, you know,
[00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.440]   my little kid is, I don't know,
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.460]   like struggling with a puzzle or something,
[00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:19.100]   and I could just do it for them.
[00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:21.300]   Or if I help them kind of regulate,
[00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.220]   oh, this is a hard puzzle,
[00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:24.300]   and you can take a break,
[00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:27.380]   I just know you're going to figure it out today.
[00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:28.860]   I just know it.
[00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:32.220]   And then because of that, they get there.
[00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:33.700]   That feels in your body,
[00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:35.580]   like that is the best kind of reward.
[00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.740]   And it's the type of reward
[00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:39.500]   that works for kids in adulthood.
[00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:40.500]   When they're in a job,
[00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.160]   we want them to be motivated
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.820]   by the feeling they're going to have of pride,
[00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:47.020]   not be saying, hey, I finished my thing early,
[00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:48.500]   do I get a bonus to their boss?
[00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.880]   Like that's not going to play out as well.
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:51.720]   - I love it.
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:55.020]   I'm just pausing and shaking my head
[00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:56.940]   only because I love it so much.
[00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:57.820]   And I just want to make sure
[00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:59.680]   that I don't quickly move to the next question
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.380]   without drilling down even deeper
[00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:02.780]   into some of these concepts.
[00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:08.860]   I believe you as the feedback or response
[00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:11.660]   that can instill real confidence over time.
[00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:15.200]   Not to get too nuanced here,
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.640]   but how is it different?
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:21.100]   Because I sense it is different than I hear you.
[00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:24.860]   I hear you, but you're going to do this anyway.
[00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:27.500]   Or I hear you, but listen in this family,
[00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:32.060]   I believe you, the word believe is powerful.
[00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:34.200]   And I believe there's real power in specific words,
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.340]   as is, you know, like for instance, sturdiness,
[00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:39.620]   again, such a powerful and underused word.
[00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:40.520]   I believe you.
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.740]   You're a psychologist.
[00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:45.920]   What do you think we're hearing
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.700]   when somebody says, I believe you,
[00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:49.980]   that's different than I hear you?
[00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:50.940]   - I haven't listed these out,
[00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:53.940]   but I think we all have these like core needs as humans.
[00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:56.300]   And I think being believed is one of them
[00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:01.300]   because it's someone else kind of saying, you're real.
[00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:05.400]   That's what, I might not feel what you're feeling,
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.360]   but that thing that feels strong to you
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:12.900]   that nobody can see or measure is real.
[00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:17.920]   And when I think about the most confident people,
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:21.000]   like I think about this girl who I went to Duke with
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.160]   and she was just brilliant, like so smart.
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:24.720]   And we were in this seminar.
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:25.720]   It was one of these small classes
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:28.160]   where this professor was like talking about stuff.
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.160]   And like, I, for once, I was like,
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:30.600]   I have no idea what this person's talking about.
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.020]   But like, I was like, no one else was stopping.
[00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:34.900]   And this girl raised her hand and she said,
[00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.300]   I'm sorry if everyone else is annoying.
[00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:39.380]   Like, I have no idea what you're talking about.
[00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:40.940]   Like, is there any, 'cause I usually do.
[00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:41.940]   And like, is there any way
[00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:44.460]   you could say that in a different way?
[00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:48.340]   That is like, to me, the utmost version of confidence
[00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:51.980]   that she believed her own experience of confusion
[00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:54.020]   was real confusion.
[00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:56.020]   She didn't think it was a sign she was stupid.
[00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:57.460]   She believed it.
[00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:58.740]   She believed herself.
[00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:01.300]   That is so confident.
[00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:04.300]   And I think when someone says, I hear you,
[00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:07.860]   it's like a version of listening.
[00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:08.900]   There's many worse phrases.
[00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:10.660]   No damage is done.
[00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:13.060]   When we follow anything but but, we tend to invalidate.
[00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:13.980]   So that's not good anyway.
[00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:15.900]   I believe you but is also not gonna.
[00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:18.380]   But there's a million examples of this to me
[00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:19.820]   that build confidence.
[00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:23.380]   And I actually think there's so many situations with kids
[00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:25.220]   where they say situations and we worry,
[00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:26.660]   oh, they have low confidence.
[00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:29.940]   And then we intervene to quote, make them feel better,
[00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:32.180]   which actually is the thing that lowers their confidence.
[00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.820]   'Cause it's like, we say to them, I don't believe you.
[00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:36.900]   You're not really feeling the way you feel.
[00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:39.340]   Where I believe you is the exact opposite.
[00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:41.300]   So like, I like to give examples
[00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:42.300]   'cause it makes it concrete.
[00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:44.060]   Like my kid will come home and say,
[00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:48.020]   I don't know.
[00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:52.140]   I was picked last for dodge ball today.
[00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:53.420]   I was picked last and something.
[00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:56.620]   And they're clearly very, very sad, right?
[00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:59.540]   And we wanna say to them, like, it's no big deal
[00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:01.340]   or everyone's picked last sometimes.
[00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:03.260]   Or, but remember yesterday you told me
[00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:04.940]   you were picked first for basketball.
[00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:08.820]   And we think like, I need to build up my kid's confidence.
[00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:12.100]   Those are confidence, I don't wanna say destroying,
[00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:14.460]   that's just reducing interventions.
[00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:17.500]   'Cause a kid is kind of coming to a parent basically saying,
[00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:20.780]   I'm very, very upset that I was picked last.
[00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:23.740]   And we're saying to a kid, no, you weren't.
[00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:25.380]   And they're like, but I am.
[00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:27.180]   And what they learn is,
[00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:29.300]   and this is really terrifying to me,
[00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:34.300]   is other people are better feelers of my feelings than I am.
[00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:39.620]   And that's like a million really scary interpersonal,
[00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:41.700]   I think, relationship, you know,
[00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:44.620]   kind of consequences later down in life.
[00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:46.900]   But when a kid says, you know, I was picked last
[00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:48.060]   and nobody even wants me
[00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:49.620]   and they all think I'm the worst athlete,
[00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:53.620]   whatever kids say, to sit and say some version of like,
[00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:55.500]   I'm so glad we're talking about this.
[00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:57.420]   And I could tell that was a really hard gym class
[00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:01.820]   and sweetie, like, I believe you.
[00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:04.300]   You will watch your kid,
[00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:07.380]   it is crazy to me what parents tell me happen
[00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:08.780]   when they say those words to their kids.
[00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:11.220]   They're like, it also just like literally
[00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:13.540]   diffused everything and they were like ready to move on.
[00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:16.220]   Like they are just trying to tell you probably
[00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:18.660]   like I was feeling something, it was a lot,
[00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:20.420]   it was confusing, right?
[00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:22.260]   Our feelings were always hardest when we're alone in them.
[00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:23.740]   So I was alone in it and I bring it to you
[00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:25.620]   when someone says, I believe you.
[00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:28.980]   Not only are they giving you that core need,
[00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:30.060]   they're also just like,
[00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:32.060]   they're like sitting down with you in it.
[00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:33.820]   And that's, that makes everything better.
[00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:35.780]   And then meanwhile, what a kid feels like
[00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:36.820]   when we say, I believe you,
[00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:38.980]   to a hard experience or hard feeling is,
[00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:41.620]   they're like the feelings that overwhelm me
[00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:43.460]   don't overwhelm my parents.
[00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:44.340]   They can tolerate it.
[00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:46.620]   They're not scared of me kind of being a loser
[00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:48.220]   in gym class one day.
[00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:52.700]   And if my parent likes me when I have that feeling,
[00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:54.740]   oh my God, I can start to like myself
[00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:56.060]   when I have that feeling.
[00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:56.940]   - Thank you for tuning in
