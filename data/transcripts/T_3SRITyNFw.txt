[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.080]   Well, over 90 times the Apostle Paul speaks of the flesh.
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.400]   So what does this key word mean for him?
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.960]   It's a shrewd and important question for any Bible reader to get clarity on.
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.920]   The question comes from a listener named Cheryl.
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.680]   "Pastor John, hello and thank you for this podcast.
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.720]   I listen to episodes every week at the gym.
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.480]   I'm trying to come up with a clear definition of what Paul means by flesh or sarks in the
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.480]   Greek.
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.800]   Sometimes Paul seems to be talking about the external physical body (2 Corinthians 75,
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.760]   1 Timothy 3.16).
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.560]   At other times he seems to be talking about some internal nature causing sinful actions
[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.080]   and thoughts (Romans 8, 5-8, Galatians 5.17).
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.200]   I'm confused.
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.520]   What does Paul mean by flesh, and do you have a clean definition to encompass it all?"
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.800]   Well, we'll see.
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:03.000]   This really is, really is a crucial question, utterly crucial for understanding, especially
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.920]   the Apostle Paul, who uses this concept so often.
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:08.920]   So let's tackle it.
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.160]   We have just a few minutes and you can write books on this.
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:20.960]   So let me limit us to something I saw recently in getting ready for a look at the book on
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.320]   Philippians.
[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.720]   Two passages in Philippians are going to shed amazing light on this.
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.720]   They did for me anyway.
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.760]   Let's start with chapter 1.
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.200]   121, "For to me to live is Christ, to die is gain.
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.560]   If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me.
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.560]   Yet which I shall choose I cannot tell.
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.400]   I am hard pressed between the two.
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:50.320]   My desire is to depart," that is, to die, "to depart, leave behind the body, and be
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.600]   with Christ, for that is far better.
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.440]   But to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account."
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:07.600]   Now I think all of us would agree that what flesh means in Philippians 1, 22 and 24 is
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.840]   simple, earthly, bodily life.
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:20.360]   Nothing negative implied about it here, except that we can't be with Jesus in the same intimate
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.440]   way if we're here as if we're in heaven.
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.320]   So over against departing and leaving the body and going to heaven, you have Paul saying,
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.060]   "I'm going to remain in the flesh."
[00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.760]   So that just simply means, "I'm going to still be in my body."
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:43.240]   So flesh refers to the body as we ordinarily experience it in this world.
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.560]   Now there are a lot of places in Paul where he uses it like that, and we shouldn't jump
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.360]   to unduly negative spiritual connotations every time we see that word.
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:59.560]   However, let's go to chapter 3 now, because what we watch happen in chapter 3 is just
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.760]   amazing, I think.
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:12.920]   Paul transforms the meaning of a fairly neutral term for physical body or some body part,
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:20.840]   he transforms that word into something negative and spiritually bankrupt.
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.720]   Let's watch him do it, because we can actually see how he does it, which defines for us this
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:27.720]   negative side.
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:35.500]   Here's what he says at the beginning of Philippians 3, "Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord.
[00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.720]   To write the same things to you is no trouble for me, it is safe for you.
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.440]   Look out for the dogs, look out for the evil workers, look out for those who mutilate the
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.440]   flesh."
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:56.520]   Now, right here we can see that Paul is using the term in an ordinary physical way to refer
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.200]   to skin or some part of the body.
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:05.700]   In fact, the next phrase is going to show us that he's talking about mutilating the
[00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:11.120]   flesh in circumcision, viewed in a certain way.
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.920]   That's why he's using the word mutilate.
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:19.940]   He's viewing this cutting of the flesh in a certain way.
[00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:27.400]   The initial straightforward meaning of flesh is simply skin or some body part, and here's
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:33.240]   how he continues, "Watch out for those who mutilate the flesh, for we, we Christians,
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.080]   are the circumcision."
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:40.780]   In other words, what I just referred to, Paul says, what I just referred to as mutilating
[00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.360]   the flesh is not true circumcision.
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.620]   We are the true circumcision.
[00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.080]   We Christians are the true children of Abraham, the true heirs of the promise, the true followers
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.860]   of the Messiah.
[00:04:53.860 --> 00:05:02.440]   And then, to distinguish precisely what it is that turned circumcision from a holy sign
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:10.340]   of the covenant into an act of mutilation, he says this, "We are the true circumcision
[00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:21.760]   who worship by the Spirit of God and glory in Christ Jesus and put no confidence in the
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.760]   flesh."
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.560]   So here's what I think Paul's doing.
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:33.040]   He is saying that worshiping or living by the Holy Spirit and worshiping or living for
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:40.240]   the glory of Jesus Christ is what makes Christians the true circumcision.
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:47.720]   And in the absence of those two things, dependence on the Spirit and glorying in Christ, in the
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:59.080]   absence of those two things, holy acts like circumcision are turned into mere mutilation.
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:06.240]   That is, mere flesh in a new spiritually negative meaning.
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:14.880]   So flesh is moving from being a mere reference to the body to being a reference to the kind
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:23.640]   of thing one does, any kind of thing one does, when the Holy Spirit and Jesus are not central.
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:28.540]   Now let's test this, because if you just keep reading, you'll see how he's thinking now.
[00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:33.640]   Verse 4, "Though I myself have reason for confidence in the flesh," which he can refer
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:37.440]   to, he says, "I don't put any confidence in the flesh, but I could if I wanted to."
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:38.440]   What are you talking about, Paul?
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:42.200]   Here's what he says, "If anyone thinks that he has reason for confidence in the flesh,
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.680]   I have more."
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:47.800]   And now he mentions things like this, four things.
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:53.680]   Circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, in other words, I was circumcised
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:58.640]   at the perfect moment, in obedience, I'm of the greatest people on the planet, I'm of
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:04.920]   the tribe of Benjamin, which had the first king and is a great tribe, I'm a Hebrew of
[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.280]   Hebrews.
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:10.360]   Now all of that is physical human pedigree.
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:20.520]   This is the physical ethnic identity and pedigree of Paul, and he calls it flesh, mere flesh,
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:26.400]   which he will not boast in, though he once did and though he could, because he's going
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.440]   to say in just a moment, "It is rubbish.
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.440]   It's all rubbish."
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:38.840]   If, if, if, if, there's no dependence on the Holy Spirit and no glorying in Christ Jesus
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.200]   over it all.
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:46.200]   And then, to make it even clearer how broad this term flesh, this new negative meaning
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:52.720]   of flesh can be, he adds these three things to his physical identity and ethnicity.
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:56.320]   One, as to the law, I was a Pharisee.
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:02.200]   This guy is maxed out in focus on God's Word.
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:05.940]   Number two, as to zeal, I persecuted the church.
[00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:10.800]   He's not only focusing on the highest standard, he's doing it with the greatest zeal.
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.520]   Third, as to righteousness under the law, blameless.
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.360]   In other words, he was successful.
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.360]   He did it.
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:22.400]   Now, those three characteristics, which he calls flesh, are not physical.
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.400]   None of them.
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:32.620]   Law-keeping, zeal, success in morality, whatever gain, this is the next verse, "Whatever gain
[00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:37.400]   I had, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ."
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:41.280]   So here's my, here's the upshot.
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:49.600]   Flesh, in Paul's vocabulary now, has become something that includes zeal, an emotional
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:57.920]   virtue, law-keeping, blamelessness, a moral virtue, only they're not virtues.
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:07.720]   Because they are missing dependence on the Spirit and glorying in Christ Jesus.
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:13.200]   So I think what we are watching, and this is just so thrilling to me to see, to actually
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:20.840]   watch Paul's mind work, what we are watching in Philippians 3, 1-7, is the process by which
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:27.760]   a positive term, flesh, referring to skin, part of the body, becomes a negative term
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:34.400]   for Paul, referring to both bodily reality, like physical descent from Abraham, and moral
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:41.400]   reality, like law-keeping, and emotional reality, like zeal, all of it called flesh, and all
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:50.600]   of it rejected as rubbish, if we don't have any reliance on the Holy Spirit in those things,
[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:54.320]   if we don't have any glorying in Christ in those things.
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:10:00.640]   In that case, he says, "I'm going to put zero confidence in the flesh understood that way.
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:04.080]   Whatever gain I had, I counted as loss."
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:09.760]   And we should ask, okay, now, when and why are those things worthless?
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:10.760]   Because they're good!
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:14.360]   I mean, it's not bad to love the law of God.
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:16.000]   It's not bad to be zealous.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.400]   It's not bad to be blameless.
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:23.360]   For goodness sakes, Paul, do you really want to call that trash?
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:30.160]   We have to ask this question, because there's nothing wrong in and of themselves.
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:34.240]   What turns it into flesh?
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:41.120]   And I think the answer would go like this, and this is my definition, so this is my last
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.400]   answer to the question.
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:53.160]   Flesh is any human action or achievement without dependence upon the Holy Spirit and without
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:11:01.160]   glorying, exalting in, trusting, treasuring, valuing Jesus Christ.
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:09.240]   It might be as gross as rape and child abuse, or as moral as trying to keep the Ten Commandments.
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:15.400]   Self-reliant commandment-keeping and child abuse would both be flesh, because they're
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:22.720]   not flowing from dependence on the Holy Spirit, and they're not glorying in Christ Jesus.
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:27.040]   Yeah, that's a really good little introduction into one of the most important vocabulary
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:28.720]   words in the entire New Testament.
