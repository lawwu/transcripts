[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:11.180]   Paul's epistle to the Galatians in the sixth chapter and the fourteenth verse.
[00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:18.120]   The fourteenth verse in the sixth chapter of Paul's epistle to the Galatians.
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:28.040]   But God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:34.480]   the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.320]   Now those who attend here regularly will know that we began the consideration of that great
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:46.640]   and mighty statement last Sunday night, and I indicated at the close of the service that
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.760]   we should be returning to a further consideration of it this evening.
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.400]   Now it is important that we should bear in mind the context, the way in which the great
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.640]   apostle came to make the statement.
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.000]   In reading my text I tried to put emphasis upon the word "I".
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.240]   But God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.580]   The apostle is contrasting himself with certain other people, and the people with whom he
[00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:26.740]   is contrasting himself are these false Judaizing teachers who had been speaking and preaching
[00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.080]   to the churches in Galatia after the departure of the great apostle, and who had been causing
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:41.060]   such confusion in the minds of those simple people with respect to the way of salvation.
[00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.540]   About them the apostle says, "Neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law,
[00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.860]   but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh."
[00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:53.860]   That is what they glory in.
[00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:03.820]   But as for me, says the apostle, out upon the suggestion that I should glory in anything,
[00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:10.620]   save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:16.020]   Now we began, I say, considering this last Sunday night.
[00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.660]   The apostle says, "This is the thing and the only thing in which I glory."
[00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.140]   And we looked at it last Sunday night in general.
[00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.300]   It's such a tremendous statement, of course.
[00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.900]   So we approached it in this way.
[00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.660]   Well, what is this cross?
[00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.140]   What is this in which he glories?
[00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:40.260]   Before you can discover why he glories in it, you must know something about it.
[00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.420]   And we saw that the apostle is very concerned to bring that out, just at this point.
[00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.100]   Here he is at the end of this letter to the Galatians.
[00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.860]   And he sums up his own great mighty argument about justification by faith only.
[00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.420]   He gives them a solemn warning to be very careful.
[00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.300]   He says that "They that sow to the flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption.
[00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.740]   They that sow to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting."
[00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.900]   So the great question is, how does one sow to the Spirit?
[00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.860]   And it's just here these false teachers were creating such trouble.
[00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.420]   And they're causing trouble in the same way to many people in the modern world.
[00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.540]   That's precisely why I'm calling attention to this whole subject.
[00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.620]   People are asking, "Well, what are we to believe?
[00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.140]   What is this Christian faith?"
[00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.780]   We are hearing contradictory statements, they say.
[00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.540]   That's what they were saying in Galatia.
[00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.240]   The apostle Paul had said one thing.
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.180]   These other teachers were saying something different.
[00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.900]   Paul said, "You believe in Jesus Christ and him crucified only?
[00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.460]   You are justified by faith only?"
[00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.140]   "No, no," said the others.
[00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.180]   "You must add circumcision.
[00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.820]   You must go back under the law."
[00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.580]   And here were people in confusion.
[00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.260]   And they are, as I pointed out, in confusion today.
[00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.860]   So nothing is more necessary than that we should be perfectly clear about our authority.
[00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.820]   And there are only two ultimate authorities, this book or anything else you like.
[00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.420]   There's no other choice.
[00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.740]   Everybody bases his opinion either on this or else not on this.
[00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.380]   I don't care what it is if it isn't on this.
[00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.660]   There are many possibilities apart from this.
[00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:17.660]   It doesn't matter.
[00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.380]   They're all the same in that they're not this.
[00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.860]   Now that's the point he makes and we consider that.
[00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:26.020]   And then he says, "Well now then, what is the truth?
[00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.140]   What is the real message?"
[00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:33.420]   And he says, "It's this, the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:38.380]   So we looked at it in general and we found that he makes this proclamation that the very
[00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:45.100]   heart and center of gospel preaching is the preaching of the cross.
[00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.380]   This is the first message.
[00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.700]   I gave you ample scriptural quotations last Sunday night to establish that.
[00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.980]   We had them again tonight in that first chapter of Paul's first epistle to the Corinthians.
[00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:56.700]   "Christ sent me not to baptize."
[00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.340]   That doesn't say you shouldn't baptize.
[00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.740]   But the big thing, he said, the first thing, "Christ sent me not to baptize but to preach
[00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:03.740]   the gospel."
[00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.300]   And what is this gospel?
[00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.540]   Well, as he goes on to say, "It is Jesus Christ and him crucified."
[00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.340]   The preaching of the cross.
[00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.060]   It is the heart and center of the whole Christian position.
[00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.780]   Not our Lord's teaching, but the cross, his death.
[00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:17.780]   Why?
[00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.140]   Well, because as he says, "It is by that we are saved."
[00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:27.220]   We considered that and then we considered how it is that the cross does save us.
[00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.620]   Now there, I say we've been looking at it in general.
[00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.700]   But it's such a tremendous statement, we can't leave it at that.
[00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:39.260]   The apostle doesn't merely say that he preaches the cross and that he believes in it.
[00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:50.740]   He says, "God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.100]   So there's more here, isn't there?
[00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:57.900]   And it is to something of this more that I want to call your attention this evening.
[00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:03.260]   At once, you see, this very word "glory" tells us this, that the cross of our Lord
[00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.220]   Jesus Christ is the test of every one of us.
[00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.020]   It is the test of our profession of Christianity.
[00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.260]   It is the test of our church membership.
[00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:17.180]   It is the test of our whole position and profession.
[00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:24.020]   There is no more subtle test as to where a man really stands than his attitude to the
[00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:29.620]   cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:37.180]   In other words, the cross passes judgment upon us all, immediately and of necessity.
[00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:41.020]   You can't remain neutral in the presence of the cross.
[00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:46.060]   It has always divided mankind and it does it still this evening.
[00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:50.700]   And what the apostle says is this, that there are ultimately only two positions with respect
[00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.580]   to it.
[00:06:52.580 --> 00:07:00.220]   The cross of our Lord Jesus Christ is either an offense to us or else it is the thing above
[00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:04.140]   everything else in which we glory.
[00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:08.700]   Now my dear friends, there is no more important question for us.
[00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:12.460]   There never can be a more important question than this.
[00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.620]   What does this cross do to you?
[00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:19.700]   Where do you find yourself as you think of it and face it?
[00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:20.980]   What is the cross to you tonight?
[00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:22.260]   It's one of these two.
[00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:27.900]   It's either an offense or else you glory in it.
[00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:31.300]   Are we all clear about our position?
[00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.100]   Do we know exactly where we are?
[00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.380]   Are there some perhaps saying, "Well, it's not an offense to me quite certainly, but
[00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:39.380]   I'm afraid I can't say I glory in it."
[00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:44.740]   Well my friend, you're in an impossible position.
[00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.940]   These are the only two positions.
[00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:50.780]   Offense, glory.
[00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:56.500]   Very well as we value our immortal souls, let us examine this matter.
[00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:57.500]   Let's look at it.
[00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:01.940]   Let's see what the Apostle has got to tell us here and elsewhere in his writings about
[00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:05.140]   these two positions in order that we may know of a surety.
[00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:08.060]   It's important you see for this reason.
[00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:11.740]   His preaching as we saw last Sunday night is this.
[00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:14.260]   It is the cross that saves us.
[00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:19.700]   By whom or by which the world is crucified unto me and I unto the cross.
[00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:23.340]   He says you see to those Corinthians, "I determined not to know anything among you save Jesus
[00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:24.860]   Christ and him crucified."
[00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:28.300]   The Apostle Paul never delivered a lecture.
[00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:31.020]   He always preached.
[00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:34.540]   The business of the Christian church is to preach, not to lecture.
[00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:38.100]   Not to deal with politics, not to deal with social conditions primarily, but to preach.
[00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.220]   "I determined not to know anything among you."
[00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:42.700]   And what a vast knowledge he possessed.
[00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:46.540]   Oh the erudition of this mighty man of God.
[00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:48.900]   Oh his profound understanding.
[00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:54.900]   Oh his knowledge of philosophy and of Greek poetry and a thousand and one other things.
[00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:55.900]   He determines.
[00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:59.220]   He becomes a fool for Christ's sake.
[00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:00.900]   It was even brought as a charge against him.
[00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:02.260]   They say that meant Paul.
[00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.220]   It was always the same thing.
[00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:05.620]   Always about this cross.
[00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:07.620]   Always about the blood of Christ.
[00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:09.940]   It was so simple it was even childish.
[00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:13.740]   He didn't take us into the heights of philosophic understanding.
[00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:17.140]   The Apostle answers and says that was all deliberate.
[00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:20.260]   "I determined not to know anything among you."
[00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:26.180]   "I know of a wisdom," he says, "howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect."
[00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:31.180]   Yet it's not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that come to
[00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:32.180]   naught.
[00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:33.180]   It's a hidden wisdom.
[00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:34.180]   It's a mystery.
[00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:36.980]   It's the wisdom of God.
[00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:41.900]   Now I say, my dear friends, the Apostle came to that position for this one big reason.
[00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:49.540]   Here is the thing that determines not only the kind of life we live in this world.
[00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:55.060]   Here is the thing that determines our eternal destiny.
[00:09:55.060 --> 00:10:02.100]   He that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.
[00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:08.220]   All the things terribly urgent in this so-called atomic world which may come to an end at any
[00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:11.900]   moment and there before us is eternity.
[00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:14.980]   Where are you going to spend it as the old preachers used to put it?
[00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:16.980]   Where are you going to spend eternity?
[00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:18.780]   Do you know what determines it?
[00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:21.780]   Your reaction to the cross.
[00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:23.860]   This is the acid test.
[00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:27.660]   This is the thing that searches us out of all our hiding and lurking places.
[00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:29.980]   This demands a decision, a verdict.
[00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:31.780]   We are either in one of the two positions.
[00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:34.780]   Which is it, I ask?
[00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:39.100]   Now let's follow the Apostle as he puts this thing before us.
[00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:41.220]   I'll put it to you in the form of some principles.
[00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:42.460]   Here is the first.
[00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:48.260]   To the non-Christian, the cross is an offence.
[00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:52.620]   Now I take that word from the fifth chapter of this epistle in verse 11 where the Apostle
[00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:59.060]   says, "And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution?
[00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:03.500]   Then is the offence of the cross ceased."
[00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:08.740]   In other words, he is saying that the preaching of the cross is an offence to the natural
[00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:11.980]   men, to the men who are not a Christian.
[00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:18.020]   Now as to the fact that that was the position in the early days, there is no doubt at all.
[00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:21.460]   We've got abundant evidence with respect to it.
[00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:25.780]   He says it, "Yah, I read at the beginning that portion of 1 Corinthians."
[00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:29.940]   He says, "I know perfectly well," he says, "that what I am preaching is a stumbling
[00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:33.180]   block to the Jews and it is foolishness to the Greeks.
[00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:37.900]   They don't like it, they don't want it, it's an offence to them."
[00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:43.020]   And he was persecuted by his own countrymen and laughed at and dismissed by the learned
[00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:48.180]   Greeks because he persisted in preaching this message of the cross.
[00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:53.860]   It was clearly and patently an offence in the early days of the Christian church and
[00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:59.060]   so it has continued to be throughout the running centuries.
[00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:03.060]   There has been great argument and disputation about the cross.
[00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:06.300]   There has always been trouble about the cross.
[00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:11.860]   This has been the dividing point so constantly throughout the running centuries.
[00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:17.220]   And it is still the same tonight.
[00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:22.300]   And that the cross is an offence to large numbers at the present time is no less but
[00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:25.940]   too obvious and too patent.
[00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:33.180]   There is scorn being poured upon it even in the Christian church.
[00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:37.180]   This theology of blood, they say, and how they hate the blood and any mention of the
[00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:38.180]   blood.
[00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:41.660]   I remember once listening to some men in discussion.
[00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:46.420]   I don't recall whether I've ever reported this to you or not.
[00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:50.460]   A Christian and a non-Christian were having a discussion about these matters and I was
[00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:53.660]   sitting in another room in the same place reading when suddenly the Christian came to
[00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:54.660]   me and said, "Come."
[00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:57.060]   He said, "Look here, you can help us in this discussion."
[00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:59.260]   So I went along with him and I said, "What's happening here?"
[00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:03.700]   And the other men, the non-Christian, who was a professional man and a very able man,
[00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:07.780]   he said, "You know, there is a dispute here," he said, "but there shouldn't be a dispute
[00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:08.780]   here."
[00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:09.780]   "What do you mean?"
[00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:12.900]   I said, "Well," he said, "my good friend here, of course I believe in morals as he
[00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:13.900]   does.
[00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:14.900]   I believe in ethics.
[00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:15.900]   I believe in living a good life.
[00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:17.340]   I believe in improving this world."
[00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:22.300]   But he said, "He will bring in this blood and thunder element."
[00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:27.220]   That was the cause of the trouble, what he called blood and thunder, what men call this
[00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:30.280]   theology of blood.
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:33.060]   They pour their scorn and their ridicule upon it.
[00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:34.340]   They hate the Old Testament.
[00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:37.780]   They hate what they call the God sitting on top of Mount Sinai.
[00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:40.900]   They hate all this offering of burnt offerings and sacrifices.
[00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:44.380]   They say that's primitive religion and you shouldn't bring it in and you shouldn't
[00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:45.780]   talk about such things.
[00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:46.780]   They hate the cross.
[00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:53.540]   It's an offense still to the polite, the sophisticated, the dilettante, the modern
[00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:56.780]   men.
[00:13:56.780 --> 00:14:04.340]   Now perhaps the people who find the cross most offensive of all are those who on the
[00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:06.460]   surface seem to praise it most of all.
[00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:07.820]   Who are they?
[00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:13.820]   Well, I'm thinking of the people who tell us that the cross is a very beautiful thing.
[00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:19.500]   They preach a lot about the cross, yes, but they preach it as something that is beautiful,
[00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:24.620]   so touching, so affecting, so moving.
[00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:28.860]   And yet I say they are, of all people, the ones who feel the offense of the cross most
[00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:29.860]   of all.
[00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:33.540]   You see, they feel it so much that they've got to turn it into something that it was
[00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:35.780]   never meant to be.
[00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:43.500]   They find it so offensive in its stark reality that they've philosophized it into the most
[00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:48.140]   beautiful thing, a kind of aesthetic enactment.
[00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:57.220]   And so they sentimentalize the cross and talk about it with great pathos.
[00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:03.220]   They I say of all people are the ones who feel the offense of the cross.
[00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:04.420]   Very well then, here it is.
[00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:09.780]   We are face to face with the same position as has been the case throughout the centuries.
[00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:13.700]   So I want to hurry to the reasons, but before I do so let me say this.
[00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:18.460]   The test of whether a man is preaching the cross rightly or wrongly is this.
[00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:22.820]   Is it an offense or not to the natural man?
[00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:28.380]   If my preaching of this cross isn't an offense to the natural man, I am misrepresenting the
[00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:30.600]   cross.
[00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:34.300]   If it is something that makes you say, "How beautiful, how wonderful, what a tragedy,
[00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:38.300]   what a shame," I haven't been preaching the cross truly.
[00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:43.220]   The preaching of the cross is an offense to the natural man, so it becomes the test of
[00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:44.220]   any man's preaching.
[00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:49.460]   Or, let me put it in terms of the congregation.
[00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:55.140]   If this element of offense in the cross has never appeared to you, or if you've never
[00:15:55.140 --> 00:16:01.140]   felt it, well then I say that you likewise have never known the truth about the cross
[00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:03.800]   of Christ.
[00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:07.880]   If you've never reacted against this cross and felt that it's an offense to you, I say
[00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:10.180]   you've never known it.
[00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:12.780]   It is an offense always to the natural man.
[00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:15.740]   Invariably, there is no exception.
[00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:20.020]   So if you've never felt it, you've never seen it, because you were once a natural man.
[00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:22.260]   There is nobody born a Christian into this world.
[00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:26.420]   We have to be born again to become Christians, and while we are natural men and women, the
[00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:28.260]   cross is an offense.
[00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:33.460]   So if we've never known this element of offense, we've not seen it, we've had some misrepresentation
[00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:34.460]   of it.
[00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:38.100]   So that brings me to the question, why then is it an offense to the natural men?
[00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:41.660]   In what respects is it an offense to the natural men?
[00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:46.020]   And the answer is, the reasons are precisely those that used to make it an offense to men
[00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:48.060]   and women in the first century.
[00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:53.340]   I'm sorry, but I have to say once more that there is no difference at all in these matters
[00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:57.940]   between the first century men and the twentieth century men.
[00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:00.020]   That's an offense in itself to you, isn't it?
[00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:02.340]   It's a part of the preaching of the cross.
[00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:06.780]   It is a part of the preaching of the cross to say that man in every century is identical
[00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:09.100]   with men in every other century.
[00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:12.100]   That's the most offensive thing to the mid-twentieth century men.
[00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:13.660]   It's a part of the offense of the cross.
[00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:16.500]   Let me show it to you.
[00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:17.500]   Why is it an offense to him?
[00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:22.180]   Well, I say first and foremost, it's an offense to his mind.
[00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:27.900]   I've got to put this first, because men's ultimate sin is intellectual pride.
[00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:31.140]   And this preaching of the cross is an offense to men's mind.
[00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:32.140]   Why?
[00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:37.860]   Because it cuts across all his preconceived notions and ideas and prejudices.
[00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:39.820]   Why was it a stumbling block to the Jews?
[00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:41.780]   For this reason.
[00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:44.420]   They said, "We are expecting the Messiah."
[00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:50.060]   And as Jews, our idea of the Messiah is that when he comes, he'll be a great military personage,
[00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:54.020]   he'll collect a great army, he'll head the army, he'll destroy the Roman conquerors,
[00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:58.860]   he'll set up Jerusalem as the greatest city in the world, and we the Jews will be the
[00:17:58.860 --> 00:17:59.860]   greatest people.
[00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:05.060]   We'll conquer the whole world and we'll be there reigning over all.
[00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:08.340]   That's what they expected.
[00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:14.100]   At first when he came and they listened to him, they were rather attracted to him.
[00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:18.500]   He seemed to have understanding, he seemed to have power, and they crowded after him.
[00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:20.140]   But they soon lost patience with him.
[00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:22.420]   He wouldn't go up to Jerusalem and become a king.
[00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:26.820]   His own followers at one occasion tried to take him by force to make him a king, and
[00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:29.820]   he had to escape up to a mountain himself alone.
[00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:34.020]   They all thought of him in these military terms, this bigness, this nationalism, the
[00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:40.540]   Jew over all, the greatest person, the greatest nation in the world.
[00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:44.460]   So when they find the one who claims to be the Messiah dying in apparent weakness and
[00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:49.440]   helplessness upon a cross, they're deeply wounded and offended.
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:50.440]   This is nonsense.
[00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:51.440]   This is ridiculous.
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:55.220]   A savior, a deliverer, dying?
[00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:57.020]   He ought to be killing everybody else.
[00:18:57.020 --> 00:19:00.820]   He ought to be powerful and mighty, a great king and conqueror.
[00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:03.260]   An offense.
[00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:07.420]   You see, it demolished their preconceived notions and ideas.
[00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:13.140]   And it was exactly the same with the Greeks.
[00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:18.100]   These men who trusted to their own ability and were so proud of it.
[00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:22.420]   This cross cuts across it, doesn't make any use of it.
[00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:24.920]   As I'm going to show you, it does the exact opposite.
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:29.780]   So immediately the cross is an offense because it cuts across all our ideas.
[00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:30.900]   We've all got ideas.
[00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:33.660]   We've got ideas about religion.
[00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:35.960]   We think we know what makes a man a Christian.
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:39.820]   We think we know what God expects, and we're quite confident that we can do it.
[00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:40.860]   We've got it in us.
[00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:44.700]   If we only put our backs into it and put our wills into it, we can do it.
[00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:45.940]   Isn't that it?
[00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:47.620]   This comes right across it.
[00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:48.940]   Let me show you how.
[00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:54.540]   The second respect in which it's an offense to the mind of the natural man is this.
[00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:58.540]   At the present time, this is tremendously important, even as it was with the Greeks
[00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:00.220]   of old.
[00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:05.660]   The cross proclaims at once that we are not saved by ideas.
[00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:07.140]   We're not saved by thought.
[00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:08.960]   We're not saved by understanding.
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:12.660]   We're not saved, if you like, by philosophy.
[00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:16.360]   But that's the one thing that the natural man believes.
[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:18.620]   We are saved by philosophy.
[00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:19.620]   Who's going to save us?
[00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:20.620]   Well, the wise men.
[00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:22.300]   Who are the wise men?
[00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:23.860]   The wise men are the great thinkers.
[00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:27.100]   They are the people who are going to save us.
[00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:28.100]   The country's in trouble.
[00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:29.980]   The country's in an awful mess.
[00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:30.980]   What can be done?
[00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:32.460]   Well, we want the best men.
[00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:36.860]   We want the best thinkers in every realm, political, philosophical, social, and in every
[00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:37.860]   other respect.
[00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:42.020]   The best men, the greatest thinkers, are going to save.
[00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:46.300]   That's how men think instinctively.
[00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:51.020]   But here is something that tells us that we're not saved by thinking.
[00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:52.700]   We're not saved by good ideas.
[00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:55.180]   We're not saved by idealism.
[00:20:55.180 --> 00:21:00.660]   The most bitter opponents of the cross of Christ in this country tonight are the idealists
[00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:02.660]   who are not Christians.
[00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:06.700]   You see, they've got their noble ideas, their thoughts about uplift and what needs to be
[00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:09.540]   done and the great profound philosophers.
[00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:10.660]   These are the people, they say.
[00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:17.660]   And they hate this cross because it cuts right across.
[00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:21.860]   And then another way in which it defends the natural man's mind is this, that they say,
[00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:26.500]   and they say it quite freely, that this whole notion of the cross is immoral.
[00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:31.620]   They say the idea that one man should be punished for other people's sins, it's an immoral notion
[00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:32.620]   and conception.
[00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:34.580]   They say the thing is quite unthinkable.
[00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:36.840]   A man who's a man bears his own punishment.
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:40.860]   This idea that somebody else comes along who's absolutely innocent and you put your guilt
[00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:43.540]   on him and he bears the punishment, the thing is immoral.
[00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:45.780]   They say we can't believe in a God who does a thing like that.
[00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:50.900]   A God who can punish his own son and cause his death to forgive others, this is immoral,
[00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:52.900]   this is not justice.
[00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:56.060]   They say it violates our sense of justice and of morality.
[00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:58.060]   Haven't you heard that?
[00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:01.220]   Perhaps you've thought that.
[00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:06.740]   If you have, the cross is an offense because as we were able to see last Sunday night,
[00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:10.100]   the essence of this doctrine is substitution.
[00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:15.500]   That he is the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world, that our sins are transferred
[00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:20.540]   to him, are imputed to him, are put upon him, that it is by his stripes we are healed, that
[00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:30.820]   God hath smitten him, God hath laid on him the chastisement of us all, and to the modern
[00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:37.020]   man, the natural human thinker, this is an offense, it's immoral, it's unjust, it's
[00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:43.860]   unrighteous, and he hates it and he rejects it.
[00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:47.780]   Or perhaps for me to sum up the whole position with regard to the way in which the cross
[00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:56.700]   is an offense to the mind of the natural man, what he cannot really abide is this, that
[00:22:56.700 --> 00:23:03.540]   he cannot understand this cross, and that's its essential offense to him.
[00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:07.700]   The natural man believes he can understand everything, and he wants to understand everything.
[00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:09.260]   Isn't this his favorite position?
[00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:11.540]   I'm not going to believe a thing which I don't understand.
[00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:15.060]   I'm not going to commit myself to anything unless I understand it.
[00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:19.540]   The man believes that he's got the capacity within himself to comprehend all truth.
[00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:21.700]   He can understand everything.
[00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:24.940]   He doesn't believe in God because he says, "I don't understand such a being."
[00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:28.900]   And the cross, he says, "I don't understand this."
[00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:32.420]   And of course the cross cannot be understood.
[00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:38.620]   As Charles Wesley puts it in a great hymn, "'Tis mystery all, the immortal dying."
[00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:40.340]   The cross is a mystery.
[00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:44.540]   This mystery of substitution, this mystery of the immortal dying, it's the mystery
[00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:46.900]   of God, as the Bible itself says.
[00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:49.260]   But the modern man says, "I can't submit to a mystery.
[00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:50.460]   I must understand."
[00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:53.220]   Here is something that tells him you cannot understand.
[00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:55.180]   It's impossible.
[00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:56.260]   It's beyond you.
[00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:57.260]   It's divine.
[00:23:57.260 --> 00:23:58.260]   It is miraculous.
[00:23:58.260 --> 00:23:59.260]   It's supernatural.
[00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:05.300]   You can't understand it, and man hates it because he cannot understand it.
[00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:09.380]   He can't leave it alone because it's there, and because he's got a feeling within him,
[00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:12.820]   some of it he's got to deal with it, and yet because he can't understand it, he hates
[00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:13.820]   it.
[00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:14.820]   It's a mystery to him.
[00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:20.860]   Very well, it's an offense to the natural man's mind, but it is still more an offense
[00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:23.660]   to his heart.
[00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:29.460]   You know, there's only one ultimate trouble with respect to the cross, and that is our
[00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:30.460]   pride.
[00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:34.900]   All men's troubles emanate from his pride.
[00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:36.060]   Why did men ever fall?
[00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:38.260]   The answer is pride.
[00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:41.460]   The devil comes and says, "Hath God said that you mustn't eat of that?"
[00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:42.460]   Of course he has.
[00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:47.580]   He said that because he knows the moment you eat of it, you'll become like God.
[00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:49.380]   And the woman liked the suggestion.
[00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:50.620]   Pride arose, and the men listened.
[00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:51.740]   He agreed.
[00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:53.740]   They wanted to be as God's pride.
[00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:58.180]   Oh, what was the cause of the fall of the one who tempted them, the devil?
[00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:01.500]   Paul tells us in his first epistle to Timothy, it was exactly the same thing.
[00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:04.900]   He lifted himself up in pride, and he fell.
[00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:06.980]   Pride is the cause of all our troubles.
[00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:08.740]   That's the thing the world doesn't understand.
[00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:09.740]   It's not surprising.
[00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:13.700]   The papers are always telling us to believe in ourselves and to believe in great men.
[00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:18.100]   Everything's telling us to believe in ourselves, pandering to our pride, building us up, inflating
[00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:19.100]   us.
[00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:20.100]   Man, modern man!
[00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:25.220]   Here comes something that smashes the idol.
[00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:28.740]   Pride is ever the cause of the trouble.
[00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:34.180]   And there is nothing that so hurts the natural man's pride as the cross of Christ.
[00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:35.180]   How does it do it?
[00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:38.380]   Well, it does it like this, doesn't it?
[00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:41.380]   Why has it happened at all?
[00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:44.340]   Why was there ever a cross?
[00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:54.060]   The answer is, because we are failures, because we are sinners, because we are lost.
[00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:59.260]   You know, the astounding thing that we are told in the four Gospels is this, that the
[00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:03.340]   Son of God, when he came into this world, was hated.
[00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:06.620]   And not only hated, he was crucified on a cross.
[00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:09.380]   Have you ever thought of that?
[00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:11.940]   Here comes the Son of God into the world.
[00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:12.940]   What for?
[00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:15.420]   Well, not to blast it, as he said himself.
[00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:18.420]   He hadn't come into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him
[00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:19.420]   might be saved.
[00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:22.100]   What harm did he do?
[00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:26.140]   He spent his time in teaching, instructing the common people and others who were ready
[00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:27.140]   to listen.
[00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:32.060]   He spent his time in healing sicknesses and diseases, relieving suffering and pain and
[00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:33.060]   sorrow.
[00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:37.500]   He spent his time, as Peter puts it in the House of Cornelius, in doing good.
[00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:40.700]   And yet they hated him, and they crucified him.
[00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:43.540]   And the mob cried out, saying, "Away with him!
[00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:44.540]   Crucify him!"
[00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:47.660]   Why were they upset by him?
[00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:49.180]   What has he done to them?
[00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:51.820]   Why should men like this cry, "Away with him!
[00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:52.820]   Crucify him!"?
[00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:57.460]   Do you know the cause of the trouble?
[00:26:57.460 --> 00:27:03.020]   He said one thing that to the natural men is the greatest insult conceivable, the most
[00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:11.500]   offensive remark that can ever be made, and it was this, "The Son of Man is come to
[00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:17.820]   seek and to save that which is lost."
[00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:18.820]   You say they didn't hate that?
[00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:19.820]   They did.
[00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:20.980]   That's the very thing they hated him for.
[00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:23.300]   I'll tell you why.
[00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:26.520]   They didn't object to the saving part, but what they did object to was the suggestion
[00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:32.940]   that they were lost, and that they were lost in the sense that they needed to be saved.
[00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:37.620]   You see, the very presence of the Son of God in this world is an utter, absolute condemnation
[00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:38.900]   of us, every one of us.
[00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:43.460]   It is because all have sinned and come short of the glory of God that he ever came and
[00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:46.140]   especially had to go to the cross.
[00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:47.500]   And this is a source of offence.
[00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:50.740]   He tells us that we are failures, that we are sinners.
[00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:52.100]   More, he says, more.
[00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:56.760]   And this is another aggravation of the offence.
[00:27:56.760 --> 00:28:00.360]   He says that we are all failures.
[00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:04.040]   He says that we are all equally failures.
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:07.240]   Now that's utterly impossible to us, isn't it?
[00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:08.240]   What do we say?
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:09.240]   Well, what we say is this.
[00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:15.640]   We say, "In our better moments, I don't claim that I'm 100 percent saint, you know,
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:19.840]   but I'm not like that hopeless drunkard.
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:23.040]   I'm not like that fallen woman.
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:25.720]   There are good and bad in this world.
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:29.800]   There are religious and non-religious people, and there's a very important distinction
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:30.800]   here.
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:34.480]   You mustn't say they say that all people are in the same position.
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:37.640]   You mustn't say that it makes no difference whether a man is good or bad.
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:41.160]   You mustn't say that it makes no difference whether a man is moral or immoral, whether
[00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:43.340]   a man has an ethical code or whether he hasn't.
[00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:44.340]   You mustn't say that.
[00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:46.360]   You say you're violating every moral principle.
[00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:47.360]   You're asking for license.
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:49.000]   You're asking for abandon.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   The thing is a lie.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   It's not true.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.280]   You tell us that the man who's stridden to live a good life and try to be religious
[00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:58.000]   and to say his prayers, you say that he's in the same position as a man who's never
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.160]   prayed, has never been near a place of worship, and has lived only for sin and evil and vice
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:03.160]   and lust.
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:04.160]   You say they're the same.
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:10.960]   And that is precisely what the cross of Christ says.
[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:14.880]   The cross of Christ says there is no difference.
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:18.520]   This was the thing, of course, that infuriated the Jews.
[00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:22.320]   But this is how the apostle puts it in Romans 3, in writing on this very thing.
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:27.120]   But now he says the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by
[00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:32.480]   the law and the prophets, even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ,
[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:43.320]   unto all and upon all them that believe, for there is no difference for all of sin.
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:46.360]   And come short of the glory of God.
[00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:48.520]   This was the thing that made them mad.
[00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:49.720]   They were mad with our Lord.
[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:51.200]   They were mad with the apostles.
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:55.360]   They preached this, you see, that there was really no difference between the Jew and the
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:59.440]   Greek in this matter of salvation.
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:01.520]   That the fact that you're a Jew doesn't save you.
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:03.520]   The fact that you've been circumcised doesn't save you.
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:05.960]   The fact that you've got possession of the Lord doesn't save you.
[00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:10.480]   That there is no difference between the Jew and the Gentile, the dog, the outsider, none
[00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:11.480]   at all.
[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:16.840]   For all of sin there is no difference.
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:20.120]   And this is the thing that hurts the pride of modern men tonight.
[00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:22.840]   The world is full of do-gooders.
[00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:24.640]   These people are anxious to put things right.
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:28.160]   They've got the, they've set up an organization, they'll form a society and you'll join it
[00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:31.080]   and you'll write protests and you're going to put the world right.
[00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:34.660]   And there's one thing they hate, it's this cross which tells them that you can never
[00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:39.440]   do it like that, that all are in the same position.
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:43.320]   There is no difference, there is none righteous, no not one.
[00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:46.520]   It's a terrible thing to be told, that all your effort comes to nothing.
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:50.200]   Well let me put that in this form.
[00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:56.360]   This cross is an offense to the pride of the natural men because it says that not only
[00:30:56.360 --> 00:31:02.720]   are we all sinners, that not only are we all of us equally sinners, but it tells us that
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:05.480]   we're all equally helpless.
[00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:07.940]   We can do nothing at all.
[00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:13.320]   It tells us that all our righteousness is but as filthy rags.
[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:19.200]   All we've regarded as best is dung and refuse and manure.
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:20.940]   Absolutely useless.
[00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:27.200]   And it tells us who believe in ourselves and in our capacity that we can do nothing.
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:32.660]   That we are utterly and completely helpless and entirely hopeless.
[00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:36.100]   And here it offends us and it hurts us.
[00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:37.920]   It damns all our efforts.
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:41.520]   It's an offense to the mind, it's an offense to the heart, and it is equally an offense
[00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:43.420]   to the will of men.
[00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:46.640]   It tells them, "Don't care what your will is, I don't care how powerful your will is,
[00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:48.680]   I don't care what your resolutions are.
[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:50.720]   Do all you will, you'll never save yourself.
[00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:54.320]   Not the labors of my hands can fulfill thy laws demands.
[00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:56.600]   Could my zeal now respite now?
[00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:59.360]   Could my tears forever flow?
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:06.220]   All for sin could not atone.
[00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:12.360]   Thou must save, and thou alone."
[00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:14.620]   It crushes us to the ground.
[00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:17.140]   It demolishes everything we've ever believed in.
[00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:22.400]   It leaves us helpless and hopeless, lost, damned, hell-deserving sinners.
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:27.440]   And it says that about every one of us.
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:32.540]   And I say that that is the offense of the cross to the natural men.
[00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:35.340]   Have you ever felt it, my friend?
[00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:39.060]   Have you resented being told that your condition is such that nothing that you can do can ever
[00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:40.440]   put it right?
[00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:44.460]   Have you ever been told, have you been ever offended by being told that you're lying there
[00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:48.720]   helpless on the ground in dust and ashes and a final hopelessness?
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:52.020]   And that though you get up and try and reform yourself and shake yourself, you'll be down
[00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:56.400]   again and in the end you'll be down and hopeless and outcast?
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:33:00.280]   Have you been able to hear that without feeling an offense, without feeling a hatred towards
[00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:01.280]   it?
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:03.200]   I say if you have, you've never heard it properly.
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:04.640]   There's something wrong with you.
[00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:10.680]   The modern man, the natural man, he hates this.
[00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:15.820]   It is the opposite of his cult of self-expression and belief in yourself and working yourself
[00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:20.720]   up psychologically and trusting yourself and trusting your own innate powers.
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:25.200]   Modern man, come of age, standing on his own feet with all his tremendous knowledge, here
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:32.640]   is something that demolishes it all, says it's useless, no value at all in it.
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:36.840]   That is the offense of the cross to the natural man.
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:38.960]   But now I say turn to the other side.
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:44.920]   The Christian, I am told, as my second principle, is one who glories in the cross.
[00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:52.600]   God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:55.480]   So let's look at this.
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:57.240]   This is the important thing for us.
[00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:58.240]   You notice what he says.
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:00.280]   He doesn't merely say that he admires it.
[00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:04.000]   He doesn't say how beautiful, how marvelous.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:09.400]   No, no, he doesn't stand there merely admiring.
[00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:10.640]   He doesn't merely praise it.
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:11.640]   I want to go further.
[00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:13.040]   He doesn't merely believe it.
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:16.480]   He doesn't merely accept its message intellectually.
[00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:19.080]   I'm going to test you, my friend.
[00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:22.840]   The Christian is a man who doesn't only believe in the cross.
[00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:26.000]   He glories in it.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.520]   What do you mean by that, says someone?
[00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:33.040]   Well, I mean what the writer of the hymn means when he says, "In the cross of Christ I glory.
[00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:42.360]   Towering over the racks of time, all the light of sacred story gathers round its head sublime."
[00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:43.760]   He rejoices in it.
[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:47.080]   Do you know the word that the apostle actually used here is a very strong one?
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:51.000]   He says, "God forbid that I should boast."
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.160]   It's a matter of boasting.
[00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:54.400]   He makes his boast in it.
[00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:57.600]   He says, "These other people want to have you circumcised in order that they may boast
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:58.720]   about their converts.
[00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:00.040]   They want to boast in your flesh.
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:02.960]   They're out for their own success and their own name.
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:05.560]   They boast in that and they boast about it, what they've done."
[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:11.800]   "Oh," says the apostle, "I boast in nothing and God forbid that I should.
[00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:15.840]   Save in the cross of Christ."
[00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:21.880]   My friend, he means by that something like this, that he not only admires it, he not
[00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:26.240]   only believes in it, he's moved by it.
[00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:28.800]   He's captivated by it.
[00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:31.960]   He says here, "You see, God forbid that I should glory save."
[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:36.480]   In other words, the Christian not only glories in the cross, he glories in the cross alone.
[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:37.640]   He glories in nothing else.
[00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:42.520]   Listen to Isaac Watts putting it, "Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast.
[00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:46.520]   Save in the death of Christ my God.
[00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:49.640]   Forbid it that I should boast in anything else."
[00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:51.320]   There's an exclusiveness about it.
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:52.320]   What does it mean?
[00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:58.920]   Well, it means, you see, that to the Christian this is the chiefest thing in history.
[00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:05.800]   It means that to the Christian this is the most important event that has ever taken place.
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:11.940]   It means that to him there is nothing which comes anywhere near it in significance.
[00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:17.520]   It means that he says that he rests everything upon this, that this means all to him, that
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:19.520]   he is what he is because of this.
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:22.320]   He glories in it.
[00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:27.080]   I want to ask a question to all Christian believers in this congregation tonight.
[00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:30.640]   Are you glorying in the cross?
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:32.080]   Or are you just saying, "Of course, I always believe.
[00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:33.080]   I always have believed.
[00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:34.080]   I was brought up to it."
[00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:36.360]   Can you speak like that about the cross?
[00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:41.000]   The test of the Christian is that he glories in it, he exalts in it, he bursts of it.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   It means everything to him.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.360]   He's got nothing without it.
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:44.800]   He owes all to this.
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:48.000]   This is the center of his universe in every respect.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:54.480]   That's what it means by bursting in it.
[00:36:54.480 --> 00:37:00.200]   Very well, then, let me just ask my final question this evening.
[00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:04.560]   Why does the Christian glory in the cross?
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:13.760]   God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:16.000]   There are many answers to that question.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.760]   Here's the first one.
[00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:21.200]   He glories in it because of what he sees in it.
[00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:26.840]   Or, if you prefer it, he glories in it because of what it shows him.
[00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:30.840]   Now I think here is the key to the whole matter.
[00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:34.440]   I must quote Isaac once again because I think he gives us the key.
[00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:42.840]   He says, "When I survey the wondrous cross," and I don't think any man glories in it until
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:44.760]   he's surveyed it.
[00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:48.400]   If you take a casual glance at it, you say, "Yes, I believe in it."
[00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:50.680]   But my dear friend, these men have been moved.
[00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:53.600]   Listen to Watts, listen to Charles Wesley, listen to all of them.
[00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:55.600]   These men have rarely seen the meaning of the cross.
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:56.680]   They can't contain themselves.
[00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:57.880]   They can't express themselves.
[00:37:57.880 --> 00:37:58.880]   Why?
[00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:01.160]   Well, the secret is they've been surveying it.
[00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:02.400]   They've been looking at it.
[00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:04.280]   They've been gazing at it.
[00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:05.720]   And you see, this is a very good test.
[00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:10.760]   How much time do you spend in thinking about the cross?
[00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:16.240]   In looking at it, in gazing upon it, in surveying it from all its angles.
[00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:21.600]   When I survey the wondrous cross on which the Prince of Glory died, my riches gained,
[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:24.580]   I can't but last and pour contempt upon my pride.
[00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:26.600]   He looks at it and he keeps on looking.
[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:27.600]   What does he see?
[00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:32.800]   Ah, it's what he sees that makes him glory in it.
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:35.760]   What does he see?
[00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:36.760]   What a question.
[00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:40.320]   Well, I'll tell you the first part of the answer.
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:43.480]   It is this.
[00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:51.200]   The Christian glories in the cross because he sees there the most amazing spectacle that
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:55.860]   the world has ever seen or ever can see.
[00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:58.240]   The most amazing spectacle.
[00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:02.520]   Now, we are living in an age that is very fond of spectacles.
[00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:09.720]   I mean in the sense of some remarkable happenings and events, some great show, some great tableau,
[00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:12.320]   a spectacle.
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:16.360]   And the Christian glories in the cross as a spectacle.
[00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:17.360]   Why?
[00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:19.920]   Well, this is what he sees.
[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:25.160]   The more he looks at that cross, the more he sees the glory of the Godhead being revealed
[00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:26.680]   to him.
[00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:32.240]   It displays to him the glory of the Godhead, the triune God, God the Father, God the Son,
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:33.240]   God the Holy Spirit.
[00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:36.440]   He sees all that shining down upon him.
[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:37.440]   What do you mean, says someone?
[00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:39.240]   Well, let's look at it simply like this.
[00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:44.720]   He looks at that cross and there he sees a man hanging upon a cross.
[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:48.160]   Who is he?
[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:53.760]   The answer is as Watts reminds us, the Prince of Glory.
[00:39:53.760 --> 00:40:00.960]   When I survey the wondrous cross on which the Prince of Glory died, what does he see
[00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:01.960]   there?
[00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:06.880]   Well, he sees these extraordinary theories of paradoxes, the most amazing paradoxes that
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:09.520]   the world ever has known or ever can know.
[00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:11.880]   You see, it's so impossible almost to describe these.
[00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:14.240]   I must call upon these poets to help me.
[00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:16.480]   And thank God they've seen it and they've said it.
[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:21.800]   You see, listen again to Charles Wesley putting it.
[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:24.520]   'Tis mystery all.
[00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:25.520]   Why?
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:29.640]   Well, he says, the immortal dies.
[00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:38.040]   Now there is a spectacle, the immortal, the one who is life and in whom is life.
[00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:40.640]   He's everlasting, he's eternal, from eternity.
[00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:43.880]   In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God.
[00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:47.560]   He's immortal, he's everlasting, but the immortal dies.
[00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:53.600]   Where is a spectacle like that in this whole universe?
[00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:58.360]   Or take it in the way in which the Apostle Peter put it in that sermon he preached after
[00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:02.560]   he and John had healed the impotent men at the beautiful gate of the temple.
[00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:05.520]   He says, "Do you know what you've done?"
[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:10.720]   He says, "You have killed the Prince of Life.
[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:12.840]   You've killed the author of life.
[00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:16.640]   You've killed the beginner of life and the controller of life.
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:20.360]   You have killed the Prince of Life."
[00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:22.060]   Now this is what a Christian sees.
[00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:25.840]   He says, "I look there at a man, but I know he's not only man, he's God-man.
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:28.640]   He's God the Eternal Son who has come down on earth to dwell.
[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:32.040]   He's the author of everything, he's made everything and he sustains everything.
[00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:33.360]   But I see him dying.
[00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:34.360]   What is this?"
[00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:37.520]   "Oh, it is the killing of the Prince of Life."
[00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:45.520]   Oh, how difficult it is to put this, but you see, as I say, the modern man, he gets very
[00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:49.160]   moved, doesn't he, by spectacles?
[00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:53.920]   He gets very moved and very thrilled by acts of self-abasement and humiliation.
[00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:58.080]   He looks at his drama on the television and he sees some great king pretending he was
[00:41:58.080 --> 00:41:59.840]   a nobody in order to do good.
[00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:02.040]   And he says, "How moving, how wonderful, how uplifting.
[00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:04.440]   Oh, it was thrilling, he glories in it."
[00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:11.200]   But look at this, Prince of Life being killed.
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:13.360]   Is mystery all?
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:19.400]   The immortal dies.
[00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:27.200]   But listen, there are other strange things that meet together at this cross.
[00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:36.440]   See from his head, his hands, his feet, sorrow and love flow mingling down.
[00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:38.640]   What an admixture, love and sorrow.
[00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:42.120]   Do you see it?
[00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:46.320]   Did such love and sorrow meet?
[00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:51.000]   Come along, that's a challenge, isn't it?
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:56.320]   You are experts in drama and in art and in music that can move people.
[00:42:56.320 --> 00:43:00.600]   Here is the question that the cross asks you.
[00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:07.520]   Did ever such love and sorrow meet together or flow mingling down together?
[00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:10.920]   No, no, it's unique.
[00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:13.840]   This is the spectacle of spectacles, the spectacle of the ages.
[00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:16.360]   Oh, listen to another.
[00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:21.600]   Or thorns compare so rich a crown.
[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:24.360]   You don't associate crowns and thorns, do you?
[00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:26.240]   They're opposites as it were.
[00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:32.600]   The glory and the splendor and the sparkle of a crown and a common thorn fit only to
[00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:35.440]   be burnt away, cast away, out of sight.
[00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:38.760]   But here they come together.
[00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:41.520]   Thorns compare so rich a crown.
[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:42.520]   Look again.
[00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:43.520]   What do I see there?
[00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:44.520]   I see one who is sinless.
[00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:45.520]   He's never sinned.
[00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:48.680]   He's only had perfect obedience to his father in all things.
[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:50.720]   He's never done anybody any wrong.
[00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:51.720]   He is innocent.
[00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:52.720]   He is pure.
[00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:53.720]   He is clean.
[00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:54.800]   He is altogether without sin.
[00:43:54.800 --> 00:44:00.760]   But I see the sinless one being punished.
[00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:09.520]   I see one who is utterly and entirely innocent, dying for those who are evil and vile and
[00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:18.680]   unworthy, dying for sinners, dying for rebels, dying for his own enemies.
[00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:25.000]   I see over and above this the one who from eternity had looked into the face of his father.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:31.200]   In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, which means the Word, the Son,
[00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:34.240]   was looking into the face of God eternally.
[00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:37.640]   And here on earth he always pleased his father.
[00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:41.120]   He prayed to his father, he looked into his father's face.
[00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:48.280]   I see one who has ever looked into the face of his heavenly Father, his Father God in
[00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:49.680]   the blessed Holy Trinity.
[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:56.800]   I see that same person crying out in agony, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken
[00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:57.800]   me?"
[00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:05.480]   That's what I see there.
[00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:11.720]   These endless paradoxes, these things that appear to be utter contradictions, all blending
[00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:19.320]   together, becoming one with a radiance and a glory upon them, I see another thing.
[00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:28.680]   I see the Lord of glory, the Word by whom all things were made and without whom is nothing
[00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:31.600]   made that is made.
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:36.240]   I see the one who has such power that he can make all things, and indeed as the author
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:41.480]   of the epistle to the Hebrews reminds us, by whom all things consist, and who is upholding
[00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:46.880]   all things by the Word of his power, holding your atoms together, holding your constellations
[00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:51.080]   together, holding the whole cosmos together by his power.
[00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:57.440]   Dying in utter helplessness, in apparent weakness, you remember how it was hurled at his face.
[00:45:57.440 --> 00:46:00.840]   "Thou who can save others, save thyself.
[00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:04.840]   Thou who can heal the sick and raise the dead, come down."
[00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:05.840]   He didn't come down.
[00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:10.600]   The power of the helplessness is all there together and at the same time.
[00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:19.320]   I read of the one of whom we are told in him was life dying.
[00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:24.120]   That's what I see as I look at that cross.
[00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:35.360]   I see one who was in the form of God, dying as a weak and a helpless man.
[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:42.680]   I see one whose concern for the glory of his Father was so great that he puts aside his
[00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:52.640]   own eternal glory in its visible form and humbles himself, makes himself of no reputation,
[00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:57.440]   takes upon him the form and the likeness of a man, indeed takes upon him the form and
[00:46:57.440 --> 00:47:05.640]   the likeness of a servant, and who humbles himself and is obedient even unto death, yea,
[00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:10.040]   the death of the cross.
[00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:14.480]   That is what I see, his concern for his Father's glory.
[00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:20.880]   I see his obedience, which was an obedience, even unto the death of the cross.
[00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:24.760]   If it be possible at this compass, by if not I'll take it, and he drank it to the very
[00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:26.080]   dregs, what's that?
[00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:28.680]   You are guilt and mine, you are punishment and mine.
[00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:30.280]   He takes it all upon himself.
[00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:31.280]   Why?
[00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:36.240]   Well, that God may be glorified and that God may be just over all.
[00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:45.400]   He renders this perfect obedience that he may honor and glorify his Father.
[00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:52.480]   But looking again at him, what I see above everything else is the love that made him
[00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:56.280]   do it all.
[00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:58.640]   Love so amazing, so divine.
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:47:59.640]   What's it mean?
[00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:02.680]   Well, let the apostle answer the question before I close.
[00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:04.480]   This is how the apostle puts it.
[00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:14.320]   "When we were yet without strength in due time, Christ died for the ungodly, for scarcely
[00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:21.000]   for a righteous man will one die, yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:26.760]   But God commended his love toward us, that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for
[00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:29.640]   us.
[00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:34.120]   Much more than being justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.
[00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:41.040]   For if while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, how much more
[00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:43.760]   being reconciled shall we be saved by his life?"
[00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:49.520]   You see, it comes to this, my dear friends.
[00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:52.720]   He is dying there because of his love.
[00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:58.040]   His love for you, his love for me.
[00:48:58.040 --> 00:49:03.640]   His love for those who are sinners, those who are rebels, those who are enemies.
[00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:06.080]   He died for people who hated him.
[00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:09.920]   As he was dying there, Saul of Tarsus was hating him, but he was dying for Saul of
[00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:17.240]   Tarsus, as Paul puts it later, the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me.
[00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:21.880]   He didn't wait until Paul had turned before he loved him.
[00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:27.280]   He loved him as he was, a blasphemer and a persecutor and injurious.
[00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:32.360]   He loved him even when Saul of Tarsus was there blaspheming his holy name, ridiculing
[00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:37.080]   this claim that he's the Son of God and the Lord of glory, ridiculing this idea that he
[00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:41.760]   is here to teach us and to die for us and to save us, pouring his blasphemous scorn
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:42.760]   upon him.
[00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:48.800]   While Paul was doing it, he was dying for Paul.
[00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:54.080]   And he was doing the same for you and for me.
[00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:59.520]   You who have reviled him and blasphemed him and hated him and regarded all this preaching
[00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:06.880]   of the cross as an offense, he did it for you.
[00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:09.440]   That's the measure of his love.
[00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:11.880]   When I survey the wondrous cross, what do I see?
[00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:13.120]   Well, that's what I see.
[00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:17.360]   I see a spectacle that the world has never seen before and will never see again.
[00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:30.120]   I see the holy Son of God bearing the punishment of my sin, the author of life dying, that
[00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:40.400]   I might live, that I might become a son, a child of God, and go on to spend my eternity
[00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:42.920]   in the glory everlasting with him.
[00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:44.440]   I leave it at that for tonight.
[00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:46.040]   This is only the beginning of it.
[00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:51.920]   I say that what we see in the cross is the glory of the Godhead shining down upon us,
[00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:54.480]   first in the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:58.880]   Have you seen it?
[00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:05.640]   If you've seen even a glimmer of what I've been trying to say, you must glory in it.
[00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:06.640]   You don't just believe it.
[00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:07.640]   You don't just praise it.
[00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:14.240]   You say, "Love so amazing, so divine, demands my soul, my life, my all, a total allegiance,
[00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:15.240]   a total surrender.
[00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:16.480]   I live for him.
[00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:20.080]   He died for me."
[00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:25.240]   In other words, we put it as the famous Count Zinzendorf, the great Moravian leader, put
[00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:27.920]   it.
[00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:33.840]   It was the turning point in his life, you remember, when he saw that portrait of Christ
[00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:38.040]   and this little inscription, "Christ dying on the cross."
[00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:42.720]   He looked at the picture, the Count, the wealthy Count, the learned Count, and this is what
[00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:49.640]   he read, "I did this for you.
[00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:53.760]   What will thou do for me?"
[00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:57.680]   And he saw that there was only one response.
[00:51:57.680 --> 00:52:05.480]   So the rest of his life, this was his confession, "I have but one passion.
[00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:11.000]   It is he and he alone.
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:14.200]   God forbid that I should glory."
[00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:22.080]   Say, in the death of the Lord Jesus Christ, do you really believe that the Son of God
[00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:26.400]   came down from heaven and died on that cross for you?
[00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:28.640]   Do you really believe it?
[00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:31.320]   You can't truly believe it without glorying in it.
[00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:34.640]   If you really believe it and see what it means, well, it's everything to you.
[00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:39.680]   It's ever everything or else it's nothing.
[00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:43.280]   Are you glorying in the cross, my friend?
[00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:50.320]   If you are, you can take it from me that you have sown and are sowing to the Spirit, and
[00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:55.200]   you will reap life everlasting.
[00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:57.240]   Amen.
[00:52:57.240 --> 00:53:01.160]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
