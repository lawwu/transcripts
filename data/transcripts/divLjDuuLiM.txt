[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.280]   - Good Monday morning.
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.840]   If you're driving to work or driving to school
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.280]   or walking the dog, whatever you're doing,
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.320]   welcome back and thanks for making the podcast
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.640]   a part of your weekly routine.
[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.320]   We really appreciate it.
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.960]   We start the week with a question from a listener named Kate
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.600]   who lives in the bustling city of Cape Town.
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.520]   Pastor John, hello.
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.080]   I appreciate you and your ministry
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.040]   from down here in South Africa,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.080]   a country with an unemployment rate at 35%,
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.080]   a rate often mentioned as the highest in the world.
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.080]   On the ground, navigating beggars is daily life for us.
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.200]   Here's a common daily scenario.
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.920]   You're sitting in your car at a stoplight.
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.920]   Someone approaches your window to ask for money or food.
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.680]   You sit facing forward, ignoring them to focus
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.940]   on the traffic light ahead until you finally drive off.
[00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.440]   Every time I do this, something doesn't feel right here,
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.280]   especially with regards to Luke 6:30,
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.200]   we should give to everyone who asks.
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.080]   But then what about 2 Thessalonians 3.10,
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.520]   that text that calls for diligent work
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.600]   or else you will not eat?
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.320]   I listened to APJ 80,
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.080]   how to handle panhandlers from over nine years ago,
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.240]   but there you didn't address this second text
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.820]   and I feel pulled between them.
[00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.960]   Pastor John, what suggestions would you have to offer me?
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.280]   - Before I give some specific suggestions
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.840]   for how to put together Jesus' command
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.280]   to give to everyone who begs from you, Luke 6.30,
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.720]   and Paul's command that those who are unwilling to work
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.000]   should not eat, 2 Thessalonians 3.10,
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.160]   let me lay a little bit of foundation
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.800]   that I think Jesus wants us to hear.
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.040]   And I'm really preaching to myself here,
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.480]   mainly as I've over the years analyzed my heart
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.160]   in dealing with folks who stand on the corner.
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.960]   I walk by them almost every day.
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.520]   So she's not alone in South Africa,
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.280]   here in the middle of Minneapolis,
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.320]   I deal with this on foot, not just in the car,
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.240]   which makes it even more poignant, I think.
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.400]   I think that Jesus' radical,
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.800]   sometimes unqualified commands are intended,
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.840]   especially, not only, but especially
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.760]   to sever the nerve of our deep, deep, deep selfishness
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.360]   as human beings.
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.080]   He meant to expose the most fundamental problem
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.200]   with human nature, John Piper's human nature,
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.200]   namely, our sinful condition that consists essentially
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.400]   in a deep bondage to self-exaltation, self-preservation,
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.760]   worldly self-gratification, all of which more or less
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.520]   conceals a self-asserting resistance to God's right
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.720]   to tell us what's good for us
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.520]   and to be for us what's good for us.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.520]   I think Jesus cares more about exposing and healing
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:16.040]   this disease of our evil self-centeredness
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.080]   than he does about working out all the details
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.200]   of how our healing and liberation from self
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:29.000]   will express itself in ways that help other people,
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.800]   like the way we deal with panhandlers
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.200]   or the way we deal with idle, busybodies in church
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.020]   who won't work.
[00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.040]   Maybe you can sense what I see.
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.600]   If I read the passage that Kate referred to in her question,
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.280]   namely Luke 6:30, but I'll do the surrounding verses
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.560]   so we can really feel the force of what Jesus says.
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.640]   "I say to you who hear, love your enemies.
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.200]   Do good to those who hate you.
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.760]   Bless those who curse you.
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.520]   Pray for those who abuse you.
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.160]   To one who strikes you on the cheek, offer the other also.
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.760]   And from one who takes away your cloak,
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.240]   do not withhold your tunic either.
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.120]   Give to everyone who begs from you.
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.800]   And from one who takes away your goods,
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.160]   do not demand them back.
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.000]   And as you wish that others do to you, do so to them."
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.320]   Now that last command is what we call the golden rule,
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.740]   do unto others as you would have them do unto you.
[00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.740]   And that golden rule is really an alternate form
[00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:49.160]   of Jesus' second great commandment in Matthew 22, 39,
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.680]   namely, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.400]   I think doing unto others as you want them to do to you
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.400]   means take the measure of your own self-regard,
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.640]   your own self-care, your own self-comfort,
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:13.000]   and make that the measure of your regard
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.120]   and your care for others.
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.520]   Now that's a devastating command.
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.520]   It is a mortal threat to our own self-exaltation,
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:29.760]   self-preservation, self-gratification, self-centeredness,
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.880]   to take all that deep commitment
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.260]   that we have to our own well-being
[00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.200]   and make it the measure of our commitment
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.440]   to the well-being of others,
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:49.440]   that's simply gloriously astonishing,
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.800]   something nobody can do apart from a miracle of God.
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.720]   I think it's the same thing Jesus was calling for
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:03.240]   when he said, "If anyone would be first among you,
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:08.240]   he must be last of all, servant of all."
[00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.260]   Mark 9:35.
[00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.060]   Being the servant of all is virtually the same
[00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.660]   as loving others as you love yourself
[00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.080]   and doing unto others as you would have them do unto you.
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:24.080]   So I'm saying all of this as a preface
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:29.140]   to the ethical effort to sort out the details
[00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:30.980]   of what love looks like,
[00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:35.140]   what liberation from self-centeredness looks like,
[00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:37.540]   because if we don't come to terms
[00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:41.460]   with our own sinful selfishness,
[00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:45.680]   we will almost certainly twist the teachings of Jesus
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.640]   and Paul to make them fit into our bondage
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.140]   to self-gratification.
[00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:55.800]   So now to Kate's specific question
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:59.640]   regarding 2 Thessalonians 3.10.
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:03.520]   The situation at Thessalonica is that
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:08.520]   some people were using the nearness of Christ's coming
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:12.080]   to justify their unwillingness to go to work
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.500]   and in an ordinary way, earn their own living,
[00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.320]   but instead they were acting like busybodies
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.980]   and going from house to house
[00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:23.800]   and were expecting others to provide the food
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.340]   and the needs that they should be providing for themselves
[00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:30.100]   by their own gainful employment.
[00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:32.120]   So Paul says to the church
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.120]   in 2 Thessalonians 3.10,
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:38.100]   "Even when we were with you,
[00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.440]   we would give you this command,
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:44.700]   if anyone is not willing to work, let him not eat.
[00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:48.940]   For we hear that some among you walk in idleness,
[00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:52.940]   not busy at any work, but busybodies.
[00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:56.240]   Now such persons we command and encourage
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:59.140]   in the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:02.220]   to do their work with quietness
[00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:05.820]   and to earn their own living."
[00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:08.860]   So these are professing Christians.
[00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:11.140]   He's exhorting them in the Lord Jesus.
[00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:14.260]   And it's not that they can't work,
[00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.520]   like they have a disability,
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.420]   but that they won't work.
[00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:19.900]   They don't want to.
[00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:23.160]   You can see that in the word not willing to work.
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.900]   So Paul is saying that one strategy,
[00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:30.020]   one brotherly, loving strategy
[00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:34.540]   to pressure these people back to doing what they ought to do,
[00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:35.780]   namely earn their own living,
[00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:40.780]   is making it harder for them to depend on the work of others.
[00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:45.060]   You might call this a form of tough love,
[00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:50.060]   but it would be very careless, I think,
[00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:52.580]   to take 2 Thessalonians 3.10
[00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:55.380]   and apply it to every beggar or panhandler
[00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:57.740]   or homeless person on the street.
[00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:02.140]   We simply do not know why they are there,
[00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:06.740]   not without getting involved with them and talking to them.
[00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:10.860]   So I think it would fly right in the face
[00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:14.920]   of the intention of the teachings of Jesus
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:19.920]   to use 2 Thessalonians 3.10 to make us resistant to beggars,
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:23.980]   assuming that they are lazy,
[00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:27.060]   and we don't know, unwilling to work for their own living.
[00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:29.220]   That might be the case, but it might not be.
[00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:31.500]   We just don't know.
[00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:35.300]   When Jesus says, "Give to everyone who begs from you,"
[00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:40.300]   I think he means that is our default inclination
[00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:44.220]   when we're set free from our bondage to self.
[00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:47.740]   That's our default inclination.
[00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:50.540]   That is our declaration of freedom
[00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:53.580]   from bondage to self and this world.
[00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:58.020]   That's our declaration of desire to be gracious,
[00:09:58.020 --> 00:09:59.540]   even to the undeserving.
[00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:01.660]   Love your enemies, bless those who curse you,
[00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:04.180]   do good to those who abuse you, and so on.
[00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:09.180]   To be sure, 2 Thessalonians 3.10 cautions us
[00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:14.340]   that there are situations in which giving to the one
[00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:18.820]   who asks would do more harm than good.
[00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:21.980]   And I think Jesus already implied that
[00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:25.180]   when he said earlier in that paragraph,
[00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:28.140]   "Do good to those who hate you."
[00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:30.860]   That means we need to think seriously
[00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:33.980]   about what is good for people.
[00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:38.980]   And when he said, "As you wish that others would do to you,"
[00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:43.020]   you would want people to do what's really good for you,
[00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:44.700]   what helps.
[00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:48.900]   So I encourage all of us to do a little bit of research,
[00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:53.820]   a little bit of homework of what would be really most helpful
[00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:56.940]   to people on the street, all things considered.
[00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:59.340]   It's not an easy question.
[00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:03.300]   And since we're so prone towards selfishness,
[00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:06.940]   I think we should err on the side
[00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:09.720]   of being taken advantage of,
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:15.620]   rather than erring on the side of shrewdly protecting
[00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:18.460]   our wallet and our ego.
[00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:22.260]   At the last judgment, I've thought about this many times,
[00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.540]   at the last judgment,
[00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:29.540]   I think Jesus will be much more prone
[00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:34.740]   to commend lavish generosity to the undeserving
[00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:39.940]   than he will be to commend how shrewd we were
[00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:43.500]   in keeping for ourselves our few dollars
[00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:45.620]   than giving them away.
[00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:47.820]   I just can't imagine Jesus saying,
[00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:50.940]   "Wow, you were especially good at being shrewd,
[00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:52.980]   at not being taken advantage of."
[00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:56.420]   I don't hear anything like that in Jesus' teachings.
[00:11:56.420 --> 00:12:00.180]   So let's know our own hearts.
[00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:03.500]   Let's confess the sin of selfishness.
[00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:07.380]   Let's pray for the compassion of Jesus
[00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:11.420]   and the far-seeing wisdom of Jesus.
[00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:14.740]   And let's do our homework, a little bit of research
[00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:18.980]   to find out how our lives as a whole
[00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:22.380]   can bring blessing into people's lives,
[00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:25.780]   especially eternal blessing.
[00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:28.260]   - Yeah, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:31.140]   And check out episode 80 for more on this topic,
[00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:33.460]   how to handle panhandlers,
[00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:36.660]   an old episode, one deep in the dark and dusty recesses
[00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:38.860]   of the archive from our first year,
[00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:41.420]   recorded over nine years ago now.
[00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:42.700]   It's incredible.
[00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:47.380]   You can find that at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:51.340]   Well, one of John Piper's favorite Bible texts
[00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:54.020]   in the entire Bible on the Christian life
[00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:55.500]   is one we're gonna look at next time.
[00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:59.580]   The text is 2 Thessalonians 1, verses 11 to 12,
[00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.620]   and it is loaded with a lot of truth
[00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:03.820]   that we need for our daily lives.
[00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:05.300]   We'll break it down next time.
[00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:06.260]   I'm your host Tony Renke.
[00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.100]   We'll see you back here on Wednesday.
[00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:09.140]   Thanks for listening.
[00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:11.740]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:14.340]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:24.340]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
