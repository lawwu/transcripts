[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.320]   A couple of related questions on imposter syndrome,
[00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.720]   self-doubt in general.
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.160]   Mike asks, "I'd love it if you could talk
[00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.960]   "about imposter syndrome.
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.320]   "Grateful for all you're doing."
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.680]   And a fist, like a fist bump emoji.
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.680]   Thanks, Mike.
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.320]   That could be one of my favorite emojis.
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.760]   I didn't know that existed and I love it.
[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.320]   Okay, Iwegzi asks, "How do you deal
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.640]   "with feeling inadequate?
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.120]   "I'm studying robotic engineering
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.680]   "and while I'm doing okay in classes,
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.000]   "there are a few very bright people
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.880]   "getting A+'s in everything.
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.120]   "Maybe I'm not smart enough
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.400]   "or maybe I'm just not working hard enough.
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.840]   "How do you come to terms with yourself
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.300]   "and your abilities and stop envying others?
[00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.220]   "You're a very successful and bright person yourself,
[00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.760]   "so I don't know if you will be able to relate."
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.040]   Yeah, no, I can certainly relate.
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.000]   I certainly don't see myself as successful
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.920]   and certainly don't see myself as a bright person.
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.160]   Okay, I think imposter syndrome
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.760]   and just self-doubt in general,
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.280]   there's a lot I could say here.
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.160]   I definitely suffer.
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.080]   I don't know if I love the term imposter syndrome,
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.600]   but for what it's worth,
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.160]   I definitely suffer from imposter syndrome.
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.720]   I think there's a few interesting things
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.600]   about human psychology to say here
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.000]   and there's a few productive things to say here.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.120]   So one, the underlying problem with imposter syndrome
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.160]   is, and just any kind of self-criticism and self-doubt,
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.360]   is that you're comparing yourself to others.
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.080]   And that kind of comparison
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:41.700]   is not fundamentally productive
[00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.440]   for your own development, for your own growth,
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.200]   except in little bits here and there
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.120]   as in moderation for fuel.
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.160]   I think that's where envy comes into
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.760]   is again comparing yourself to others.
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.840]   To me, I've certainly experienced envy
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.240]   as we all have, especially when you're first
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.820]   getting into a particular line of work or efforts.
[00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.980]   But what I learned, and actually here,
[00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.640]   again, I admire Joe Rogan.
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.080]   I think he taught a lot of people,
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.000]   like in this case, it's in the comedy world,
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.640]   that sharing and sending a lot of love
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.640]   and promoting others is better for everybody,
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.400]   including for yourself.
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.280]   It's ultimately the path to happiness
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.200]   as opposed to being envious of others
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.100]   or comparing yourself to others in a negative light
[00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.980]   is being happy for others, other people's success.
[00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.600]   When I see somebody succeed,
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.800]   I think there's two things that I feel
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.980]   that I have learned ultimately make me happy
[00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.480]   and make me a better person.
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.480]   One thing is I feel just pure, simple joy at their success.
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:11.120]   It's just, if you allow yourself,
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.980]   it's fun to see other people succeed
[00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.320]   at something they're good at,
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.040]   something they're passionate about.
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.240]   It's just fun, just being a spectator of it.
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.620]   If you allow yourself to sort of not see it
[00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.620]   through the lens of comparison and striving,
[00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.100]   we're just mortal beings
[00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.000]   and you don't need to sort of see it as a race.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.560]   If you just see it as an observer of something beautiful,
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.200]   and I certainly just enjoy others being good
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.200]   at their art, at their skill, at their craft.
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.500]   This can be more difficult
[00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.840]   if that person is doing something
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.520]   very similar to what you're doing.
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.120]   That's when it gets more challenging,
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.680]   but I assure you, at least for me,
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.940]   even in that case,
[00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.280]   it's beautiful to appreciate the work of others.
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.760]   Just be happy for their success.
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.560]   And the other is, it's a neighboring feeling,
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.500]   but it's an inspiration.
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.800]   Sort of, I wouldn't see it as a dark,
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.200]   it's like the positive side of envy.
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.760]   Sort of realizing, holy crap, that's possible.
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.400]   Now if that's possible,
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.520]   and he or she is human,
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:33.920]   then I could do that too.
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.520]   I'm human too, and I can get that to that level.
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.520]   There's no, all the amazing, rich, powerful,
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.920]   brilliant people I've gotten a chance to meet,
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.680]   especially with the podcast in the past year,
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.400]   the number one lesson I've learned talking to them
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.840]   is that they're all human.
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.560]   They are not very different from me.
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.880]   Many of them have huge amounts of flaws.
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.540]   They all suffer from laziness, procrastination.
[00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.220]   They all have imposter syndrome.
[00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.440]   They're all human.
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.280]   They're all human,
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.720]   and they're not much different from you and I.
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.480]   And that means when you see excellence,
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.560]   that should be an inspiration.
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.600]   Wow, that's possible.
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.800]   When somebody gets to the four minute mile,
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.160]   that's possible.
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.960]   That shouldn't be like, oh, I can't believe
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.600]   they got to the four minute mile first,
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.800]   or something like that, no.
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.680]   That means if four minutes are possible,
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.800]   then maybe 350 is possible, right?
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.240]   And you just push it, and push it, and push it further,
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.560]   especially with people that are working
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.380]   closer than you feel.
[00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.060]   Those are the two feelings I feel.
[00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.780]   And the other kind of neighboring feeling
[00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.480]   in terms of why comparison is a useless process
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.840]   is, at least for me,
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:54.020]   I believe that success in life
[00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.980]   is finding your own thing,
[00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:59.780]   finding and paving your own path,
[00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:06.260]   not getting farther on somebody else's path than them,
[00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.060]   or not sort of outracing somebody else
[00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.900]   on an already paved path,
[00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:15.340]   is forming a new path to creating something new,
[00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:19.060]   hopefully something fundamentally new,
[00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.140]   so new that nobody could have even imagined,
[00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:26.180]   but even new in small ways, so paving your own way.
[00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.480]   And there, comparison doesn't matter.
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:33.340]   I think that's one other instructive feeling
[00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:34.980]   when you're envious of others,
[00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:38.820]   if they're getting an A+ in a particular class,
[00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:40.940]   if they're in academia,
[00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.300]   you can have sort of all kinds of metrics,
[00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.420]   citations, which university you are in,
[00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:50.500]   where you are in the hierarchy of faculty position,
[00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.500]   assistant professor, associate professor, full professor,
[00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.500]   what kind of awards you have, recognitions you have,
[00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:00.440]   what kind of grants you have in terms of amounts of money.
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:04.480]   In business, it could be the profits,
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:07.460]   it could be as silly as your social media presence,
[00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:10.160]   the followers and all that kind of stuff.
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:14.660]   All of those are measures of your place
[00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:16.240]   in somebody else's race.
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.240]   That rhymes.
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:22.120]   It could be a haiku even.
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:28.620]   I think the thing you need to do is to pave your own path.
[00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:31.780]   I early on realized that,
[00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:33.720]   I became disillusioned.
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:39.600]   So for a long time, getting A's for me meant success.
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.040]   Excelling at school was success.
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:43.560]   And at a certain point in college,
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:48.560]   I realized that it's a trap
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.480]   for my skill level,
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.400]   that the creative,
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.800]   it's hard to put into words,
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:00.360]   but there's a certain thing you become
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.180]   if you allow yourself to be introspective,
[00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:04.580]   to look at yourself in the mirror
[00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:08.580]   and ask the question of, what am I good at?
[00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:13.500]   What will the path that I can pave,
[00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:15.860]   something new, look like?
[00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:18.860]   And you realize that school deludes you
[00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:22.600]   into thinking it's important
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.220]   to go down somebody else's path.
[00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:28.140]   Now, for a lot of people, school might be very effective.
[00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:31.820]   That could be a success in academia for a lot of people.
[00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:35.740]   Getting a PhD and diving in deep in a particular topic
[00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:38.860]   is actually how they find their art,
[00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:40.620]   how they discover their beauty.
[00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:42.940]   Through that process, they find a problem
[00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:44.180]   that's fundamental.
[00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:49.180]   For me, the thing I would like to create in this world
[00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:54.460]   is some weird mix of deep scientific ideas,
[00:08:55.580 --> 00:09:00.580]   but also artistry, and also doing very crazy things
[00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:05.940]   in terms of both business and ideas
[00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:10.940]   that requires you to take a path that's nonlinear.
[00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:17.460]   And so when you see other people getting better grades,
[00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:18.580]   I was in that point.
[00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:22.220]   I realized I don't care about grades anymore.
[00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:27.220]   And I care about diving deep and exploring worlds
[00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:30.780]   that fascinate me, feeding the passion,
[00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:32.720]   feeding the fire of that passion,
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:36.700]   rediscovering different aspects of that passion.
[00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:40.700]   So my advice in terms of when you have self-doubt
[00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:45.700]   is to not, self-doubt is grounded
[00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:48.700]   in your comparison to others.
[00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:52.740]   Instead, focus on finding the passions in your life,
[00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:55.740]   irrespective of others, something totally new.
[00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:59.100]   Find something that you're excited about.
[00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:02.580]   Now, this could be a painful process of,
[00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:05.540]   this is the beauty and the suffering
[00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:07.260]   of the creative process.
[00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:11.420]   It can take a while, but you shouldn't be distracted
[00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:13.700]   by what the world tells you to do.
[00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:15.740]   You should focus on this journey
[00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.580]   and discovering that passion,
[00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:21.260]   because then comparison will matter of within that passion.
[00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.700]   The only comparison you'll be making
[00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:28.700]   is to how far you've gone down the road yourself
[00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:33.020]   of achieving that passion.
[00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:36.020]   One of the things you have to kind of think
[00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:41.020]   is you have to look ahead and think of,
[00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:45.220]   so when you imagine your passion,
[00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:47.620]   for me there's particular things I've talked about it.
[00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:49.300]   I haven't been able to articulate it well,
[00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:52.420]   but it's something about companionship
[00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:54.380]   with artificial intelligence systems,
[00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:56.060]   of having deep connections,
[00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:57.980]   whether that's whatever the space is.
[00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:59.980]   It could be in personal robotics in the home,
[00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:02.620]   or it could be with autonomous vehicles,
[00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:04.020]   semi-autonomous vehicles.
[00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:06.780]   It could be any kind of human-robot interaction context.
[00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:11.060]   I have visions, like literally I can visualize the world
[00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:15.000]   that I would love to help create.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   And that really helps you pave different little paths
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.100]   that are off the beaten road, off the beaten path,
[00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:28.060]   that it allows you to not listen to others.
[00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:29.520]   It allows you to not use the metrics
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:31.420]   of comparison to others.
[00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:36.420]   And that's how I don't even acknowledge
[00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:38.580]   imposter syndrome as a thing.
[00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:40.460]   I feel it all the time.
[00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:42.260]   I feel like a fraud all the time.
[00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:47.260]   I get more and more now, it's kind of hilarious.
[00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.500]   As you get older, you get more prestige and so on.
[00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:53.860]   I get called a thought leader,
[00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:58.860]   which is the most ridiculous label of all time.
[00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:04.060]   Or more sort of common is expert.
[00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:06.420]   I'm an expert in autonomous vehicles,
[00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:08.180]   or expert in artificial intelligence,
[00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:09.920]   or expert in whatever.
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:12.900]   And any time somebody says that kind of thing,
[00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:14.020]   it seems silly to me.
[00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:17.380]   It seems that I know so little.
[00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:21.020]   And the more I learn, the less I feel like I know.
[00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:24.820]   So that feeling of imposter syndrome
[00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:26.420]   in comparison to others,
[00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:28.460]   in the silly context of conferences
[00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:30.260]   where everyone's like Dr. Friedman,
[00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.040]   that kind of thing, it seems absurd.
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:35.700]   But it's useless in the grand scheme
[00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:37.860]   of my pursuit of my passions.
[00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:39.340]   There's no imposter syndrome.
[00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:43.740]   I truly, so there's a mix of humbleness.
[00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:44.760]   Just like you heard now,
[00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:47.460]   I generally have a profound humbleness
[00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:49.280]   about my place in this world.
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.380]   But I also have an ego.
[00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:53.140]   And that ego has to be maintained too.
[00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:55.620]   It's a powerful thing, it's a useful thing.
[00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:59.580]   And I have a belief, a self, a deep self-belief
[00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:02.460]   that on that path I'm traveling,
[00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:04.180]   that new path I'm paving,
[00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:08.360]   I am the best person in the world to pave that path.
[00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:13.360]   That little unique little road is I am the right person.
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.240]   This is the right time.
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:17.760]   I am the best person in the world for that.
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:21.900]   So there I am, it's not an imposter syndrome.
[00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:25.420]   There I'm truly meant to be great.
[00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:29.420]   And that's my own little corner of the universe.
[00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:31.300]   There's billions of them.
[00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:32.140]   But that's mine.
[00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:35.040]   And at that, I'm the greatest in the world.
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.780]   And there you have to have that ego.
[00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:38.320]   It might turn out to be nothing.
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:40.240]   But I'll be the best at nothing.
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:41.920]   It might turn out to be something great.
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:44.280]   And then I'll be the best at that degree.
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:46.980]   But that's where I get that confidence.
[00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:49.700]   That little gem, that little fire always burns
[00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:50.820]   because it's mine.
[00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:55.460]   I had to quickly Google one of my favorite poems
[00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:56.940]   to insert here.
[00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:59.140]   It's called "In the Desert" by Stephen Crane.
[00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:03.040]   That kind of gets to this point
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:05.460]   of having your own little place in the universe
[00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:08.580]   and appreciating it, deeply appreciating it
[00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:12.140]   without jealousy, without envy, having this little piece.
[00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:15.380]   He writes, "In the desert, I saw a creature,
[00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:18.900]   naked, bestial, who squatting upon the ground
[00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:22.420]   held his heart in his hands and ate of it.
[00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:25.260]   I said, 'Is it good, friend?'
[00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.340]   'It is bitter, bitter,' he answered.
[00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:31.660]   'But I like it because it is bitter
[00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:33.300]   and because it is my heart.'"
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.620]   Okay, being read like this, it sounds absurd.
[00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:41.260]   Stephen Crane is an absurd poet and I love his work.
[00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:46.260]   But it's basically, it's your own, it might be bitter.
[00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:52.060]   It might be some sort of definitions of success
[00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:55.940]   in this world, your path, your journey,
[00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:58.860]   your career might be a failure.
[00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:02.860]   But it shouldn't be a failure in your eyes.
[00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:07.860]   You should be true to the journey and to your passion
[00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:11.880]   and pursue as much as possible, as much as possible.
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:15.320]   The money, all the material, possessions,
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:16.680]   all that doesn't matter.
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:20.920]   As much as possible, as long as you can feed yourself
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:24.160]   and maintain minimum shelter and feed your family,
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:28.000]   the pursuit of the passion should overcome everything.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.040]   And then all the other things of self-doubt,
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:34.280]   of imposter syndrome and things like that will fade away.
[00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:40.520]   Now, all that said, I should mention that,
[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:43.480]   I'm full of contradictions in some sense.
[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:47.400]   I should mention that being self-critical is a superpower.
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:55.720]   Being self-critical, I think, is a superpower.
[00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:57.460]   But it's also a poison.
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:05.720]   It's a interesting balance you have to strike.
[00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:09.360]   I guess it would, if I was trying to be poetic,
[00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:14.360]   I would say that self-criticism, self-doubt is a poison.
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:26.440]   And then gratitude is the antidote for the poison.
[00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:32.520]   But that poison is exceptionally useful for growth.
[00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:39.660]   That self-criticism, sometimes bordering on self-hatred,
[00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:45.520]   man, the human psyche, it's an interesting dance.
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:48.440]   Those demons could be useful.
[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:50.440]   It could be useful for growth.
[00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:54.960]   Of hating the work you've done could be useful for improving.
[00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:58.600]   I remember Marvin Minsky said something like this,
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:01.520]   saying that he's hated everything he's ever done.
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:05.460]   Now, that can come off sounding wrong.
[00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:07.540]   And I think there's, again,
[00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:10.880]   you can have too much of the poison, but a little bit.
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:13.200]   Like Tom Waits says, "I like my town
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:15.640]   "with a little drop of poison."
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:18.200]   I think that little poison could be really useful.
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:20.800]   So the self-criticism, self-doubt I have,
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:24.840]   the feeling I often, if I give a lecture,
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:26.800]   if I have a conversation on the podcast
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:31.160]   or I have a paper I submit, I write something someplace
[00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:33.440]   or try to articulate a point,
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:38.440]   or I have an exchange of ideas with people
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:41.960]   on something technical, I often leave feeling
[00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:48.240]   full of sort of maybe hating how inarticulate,
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:54.600]   unintelligent, how lacking I was in my ability
[00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:57.360]   to arrive in some clean insight,
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:59.720]   to provide something valuable to that conversation,
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:01.400]   to that lecture, to that debate.
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:05.160]   So there's a kind of self-hatred, a self-criticism.
[00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:07.140]   And a lot of people might say, "Well, that's really dark.
[00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:10.280]   "You shouldn't feel that way."
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:13.600]   But I think that's really useful.
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:18.600]   And in generally, the way I approach this kind of feeling
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:24.040]   of self-doubt and self-criticism in comparison
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:27.080]   to myself, what I could be,
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:29.700]   and perhaps as grounded in a comparison to others,
[00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:33.240]   is I do a little bit of moderation
[00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:36.920]   about things I'm working on currently
[00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:41.000]   and things I've done recently.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.780]   But always, in every individual moment,
[00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:45.700]   I have a deep, profound gratitude.
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:50.360]   I have some water here.
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:55.080]   Ah, delicious.
[00:18:55.080 --> 00:19:00.360]   It sounds absurd, but I have a deep gratitude
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:03.720]   for the fact that I have the ability
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:06.380]   to have water in front of me.
[00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:10.040]   By the way, this water bottle,
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:12.680]   it's clearly, it's Powerade.
[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:14.360]   I refill it with water.
[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:16.200]   I just keep using this bottle.
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:18.000]   And I do the same, people always say,
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.160]   plastic bottles in the podcast.
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:24.900]   I refill them, for me, as much as I can with water.
[00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:30.720]   So, for example, I have a general dissatisfaction
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:34.000]   of how inarticulate I am with, for example,
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.460]   answering this very question.
[00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:38.840]   (chuckles)
[00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:41.680]   I could do a lot better, I think,
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:45.340]   and I'll feel that way, especially after I stop recording.
[00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:47.360]   That's fine, and I think that'll grow,
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:49.760]   that'll help me be better next time.
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:53.040]   But throughout it, I'm deeply grateful for this water.
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:56.280]   I'm deeply grateful for having a shelter.
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:58.600]   It's windy and cold outside right now,
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:03.560]   and I am here in a heated environment
[00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:06.360]   that keeps me warm.
[00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:10.040]   I can have, I have a coffee maker, I can make a coffee,
[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:13.440]   and I'm still alive and healthy,
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:18.340]   and I have incredible people I get to talk with.
[00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:20.860]   Just that whole, every single moment,
[00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:22.580]   whether I'm sleep-deprived,
[00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:25.260]   whether I just stub my toe on something,
[00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:29.740]   whether I'm going through even difficult stuff,
[00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:32.260]   you know, difficult emotional,
[00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:35.220]   the loss of different kinds, strategies,
[00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:39.860]   it's still, I'm deeply appreciative of the water
[00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:43.640]   and the heat and the
[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:49.640]   plenty of love in the world around me.
[00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:53.600]   So it's that balance of self-criticism
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:55.980]   and deep gratitude for every single part
[00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:58.400]   of the individual moment that make up life.
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:01.800]   That allows you to be happy
[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:04.780]   and have a little bit of fire under your butt to,
[00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:09.460]   that doesn't even, that expression doesn't even make sense,
[00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:13.960]   to a little bit of fire, motivating fire to drive you,
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:17.100]   to give you a reason, to give you a,
[00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:22.640]   sort of an itch to improve, to grow,
[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:26.320]   to challenge yourself, to go outside the comfort zone,
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:29.400]   and throughout it, again, that gratitude.
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:31.080]   So I hope that gets to it.
[00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:35.400]   I think imposter syndrome is a natural feeling,
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:40.400]   but it should not be, it should not lead to envy,
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.500]   so the darker side is your comparison to others.
[00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:47.180]   I think the way I would advise,
[00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:49.300]   and the way I try to live life myself
[00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:54.300]   is when I compare myself to others and see their success,
[00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:58.700]   I'm enjoy, I'm really happy for them.
[00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:00.700]   I enjoy watching them excel.
[00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:03.280]   I use it as an inspiration,
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:08.280]   and any kind of degree of self-doubt I do have,
[00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:10.620]   I use it as fuel.
[00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:14.460]   I use it as fuel for myself to improve.
[00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:17.820]   And again, isn't everything, I've come back to this often,
[00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:22.820]   but gratitude for every single moment is essential,
[00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:27.860]   essential for happiness, essential for clarity of thought.
[00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:30.780]   You know, I've talked about burnout in a previous thing,
[00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:34.080]   and people said, you know,
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:36.120]   people have different views on burnout and so on.
[00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:39.460]   I think if you're just deeply grateful
[00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:42.140]   and appreciative of every moment,
[00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:45.040]   then burnout becomes less likely.
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:49.980]   I know people have suffered in different kinds of ways
[00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:52.660]   from all kinds of different angles,
[00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:54.300]   they have different life paths.
[00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:56.020]   I can only speak to myself.
[00:22:56.020 --> 00:23:00.680]   To myself, life is easier if every part
[00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:04.140]   of every moment of every day is filled
[00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:06.880]   with something you can be deeply appreciative of.
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:10.820]   And I think it is, the fact that we're alive,
[00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:13.900]   the fact that we get a chance to experience this moment,
[00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:16.540]   to me, is a beautiful gift.

[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:21.700]   (upbeat music)
