[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.620]   I am James Hong and welcome to the Surpassing Value Podcast.
[00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.740]   The fuel and desire for this podcast was born out of a compulsion to flesh out what's
[00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.600]   been going on in the midst of an ocean of megaphones that may not actually withstand
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.620]   the test of scrutiny.
[00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:32.340]   As a signpost theologian, I will do my best to filter out the impurities and point people
[00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:39.940]   in the right direction.
[00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:47.580]   In episode 5, I explored the topic of social justice and entitled that episode Social Justice
[00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.340]   Chapter 1.
[00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.440]   At the time I put the working draft together for that episode, I didn't think I'd have
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.440]   a chapter 2.
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.660]   At around the time I finished recording chapter 1, I felt convinced that there was much left
[00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.500]   unsaid and undealt with.
[00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.940]   Although that sentiment is arguably true for every topic I've addressed so far, it would
[00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:17.020]   only be true if we were thinking about it in a very strict sense, but I'm not talking
[00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:24.700]   about it in a strict sense, rather I'm thinking about it in a very podcast-y sense.
[00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.560]   So that's how this episode was birthed, and also the reason why in the beginning of this
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.480]   episode I want to recommend some resources as any competent signpost theologian would
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:41.540]   do, and as you know, I am aspiring to be a competent signpost theologian.
[00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:49.940]   None of the topics I cover do I cover exhaustively, so if you want further follow-up for this
[00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.820]   topic, here are some resources.
[00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:02.300]   Professor Vodie Bauckham's sermons/lectures on these issues are a must.
[00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:08.260]   I've alluded to them before, but if you were to input his name into any search engine and
[00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:15.940]   include the words "ethnic Gnosticism", "racial reconciliation", or "cultural Marxism", they
[00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:24.460]   are very helpful, Vodie is spelled V-O-D-D-I-E, last name is Bauckham, B-A-U-C-H-A-M, just
[00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:30.460]   input his name and "ethnic Gnosticism" or "racial reconciliation" or "cultural Marxism"
[00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.540]   and you'll see his one-hour sermons/lectures.
[00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:43.060]   Neil Shenvey, N-E-I-L Shenvey, S-H-E-N-V-E-Y, I've already endorsed him, but he has written
[00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.660]   extensively about critical race theory and I heard today actually that he is going to
[00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.940]   be coming out with a book scheduled for 2022 concerning apologetics.
[00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:01.880]   If you go to his website, Neil Shenvey Apologetics, you will find a treasure trove of resources
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.540]   as it relates to critical race theory, social justice, and other topics.
[00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.420]   I've mentioned repeatedly the Just Thinking Podcast and I will do so again with Daryl
[00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.060]   Bernard Harrison and Virgil Walker.
[00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:21.700]   The Bar Podcast Network, Just Thinking is a part of the Bar Podcast Network and that
[00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.980]   is headed up by Dwayne Atkinson.
[00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.420]   The Center for Biblical Unity has been doing great work in this area.
[00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:35.020]   They are headed up by Monique Dusson and Krista Bontrager.
[00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:40.500]   Edwin Ramirez over at the Proverbial Life Podcast is another notable one along with
[00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.960]   Jamal Bandy, he is over at Prescribed Truth.
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.580]   I really also like Ali Beth Stuckey over at Relatable.
[00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:55.060]   If you are more of a blog person, there is a ton, but I think Samuel Tse, S-E-Y, Samuel
[00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:07.800]   Tse, he has done some really extensive good work on cultural race issues, pro-life issues.
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:14.180]   He speaks with clarity, with candor, and with conviction.
[00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.180]   He is interesting because he is actually a Ghanaian-Canadian, he is not an American dude,
[00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.260]   he is a Ghanaian-Canadian.
[00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:33.340]   He immigrated over from Ghana, he is currently out in Toronto, and he writes from a very
[00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:39.880]   witty perspective, almost GK Chesterton-like, and what I mean by that is he is able to take
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:47.860]   vast avenues of thought, shrink them, and still hold their meaning.
[00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:53.680]   So that is a very high compliment to say he is very GK Chesterton-like, I don't say that
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:54.680]   lightly.
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:01.020]   I have a lot more, that's already a lot right there, but I have much more that I can point
[00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.600]   you towards.
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:13.280]   Feel free to reach out to me at thesurpassingvalue@gmail.com.
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:20.080]   Initially for this episode, I was going to amalgamate two books.
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.960]   That was going to be the structure of this episode.
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:31.000]   Those two books were Confronting Injustice Without Compromising Truth by Thaddeus Williams,
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.200]   and the other book was By What Standard, and that has contributing authors, Tom Askell,
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:43.720]   Vodie Bauckham, Mark Koppinger, Jared Longshore, Tom Nettles, and Chad Vegas.
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:51.280]   However, as I was putting this episode together, there was no way I could amalgamate those
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.640]   two books because this episode would have been way too long.
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:59.400]   I would have had to have done two separate episodes, maybe even a chapter three, which
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.640]   is possible.
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.480]   At this point, I don't plan on it.
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:12.080]   So for the remainder of this episode, what I'm going to do is essentially do a book review
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:18.320]   on Confronting Injustice Without Compromising Truth, which is a book that's due out December
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.320]   22nd.
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.840]   By the time this episode hits, it might already be out.
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.960]   It'll probably be past December 22nd.
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:30.040]   I am recording this on December 3rd.
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:36.960]   Now, By What Standard, by those contributing authors, in my opinion, acts as a very nice
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.760]   complement to Confronting Injustice Without Compromising Truth.
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:48.880]   I think you can read those two books together, and there isn't too much that's qualitatively
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.360]   duplicative.
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:56.440]   You would benefit tremendously from those two books.
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:05.400]   If you could only read two books on this ginormous issue, those would be the two books that I
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.200]   would recommend.
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:12.080]   To a lesser degree, I would recommend Why Social Justice Is Not Biblical Justice by
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.080]   Scott Allen.
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.520]   I say to a lesser degree.
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:18.480]   I don't mean to cast a negative shadow on the book at all.
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:23.280]   I'm only saying that because I understand that we all have a limited amount of time,
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:28.160]   and realistically, we do need to triage what we read.
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:37.760]   Another book I would recommend is Political Visions and Illusions by David Koizis.
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:45.160]   That's another good one if you want to understand in a very non-partisan way the worldviews
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:55.800]   behind socialism, capitalism, conservatism, liberalism, and other worldviews.
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:08:01.860]   This book gives a fair treatment into the ideas behind various political philosophies,
[00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:11.240]   as opposed to just virtue signaling and anti-intellectualism, veiled insulting, and cherry-picking that
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:19.000]   is very prevalent on social media and amongst other self-professing Christians.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.560]   I think this is a good spot to emphasize a reminder because I am proffering all these
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:25.560]   resources.
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:32.760]   So, as I proffer all these resources, I wanted to emphasize a reminder to the listener, and
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:37.680]   this comes from Ecclesiastes 12, 11-14.
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:49.100]   Ecclesiastes 12, 11-14 says this, "The words of the wise are like goats, and masters of
[00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:54.520]   these collections are like driven nails; they are given by one shepherd.
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:09:02.160]   But beyond this, my son, be warned, the writing of many books is endless, and excessive study
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.760]   is wearying to the body."
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:10.600]   The conclusion, when everything has been heard, is fear God and keep His commandments, because
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:13.160]   this applies to every person.
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:18.880]   For God will bring every act to judgment, everything which is hidden, whether it is
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:22.920]   good or evil.
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:28.640]   Emphasizing verse 12 here, "But beyond this, my son, be warned, the writing of many books
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:36.280]   is endless, and excessive study is wearying to the body."
[00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:42.120]   Verse 13, "The conclusion," after he says this, "The conclusion, when everything has
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:51.920]   been heard, is fear God and keep His commandments, because this applies to every person."
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:10:02.800]   In your own personal life, there is only one book that will actually feed your soul.
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:12.760]   There is only one book that you prioritize as the crown jewel that dictates how you view
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:15.000]   everything else.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:21.120]   No other book is truth absolutely.
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:27.080]   This includes even the writings of other hallowed and sacred theologians.
[00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:37.240]   There is only one book that is all you need for life and godliness.
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:41.760]   This ties in with the doctrine of the sufficiency of scripture, which I do plan on covering
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:43.760]   in some future episode.
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:51.780]   But for now, I want to remind you that I'm giving you these resources not because I feel
[00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:58.720]   that it is necessary for your life per se that you read up on them.
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:06.360]   I'm giving them to you because if you are interested in the topic and you want the falsehood
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:13.080]   to be unveiled, then those resources are available for you.
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:20.560]   At the same time, I am hoping that you are able to philosophically and theologically
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:34.080]   triage in your own personal life what is necessary versus what is important versus what is frivolous.
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:43.560]   Do not sacrifice the necessary or the important for the frivolous.
[00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:48.840]   If anything is going to be taken out, take out the frivolous and then you can have the
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:56.920]   important but you never sacrifice what is necessary.
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:02.760]   For the rest of the episode, I'm going to be conducting a book review for confronting
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:06.080]   injustice without compromising truth.
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:10.740]   Confronting Injustice Without Compromising Truth by Thaddeus Williams.
[00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:17.240]   I was very fortunate to be part of the launch team prior to the book being available to
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:25.240]   the public and I have to say that this book exceeded my expectations.
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:31.360]   Professor Williams states in the preface that it took him four years to write the book and
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:36.520]   I could easily see why it took him four years to write the book.
[00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:41.660]   The book is not only well written but it is easily digestible, it is heartfelt, it is
[00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:47.000]   charitable without skipping on intellectual rigor.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.520]   The other exceedingly high compliment I would give it is that I came out of reading this
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:13:01.280]   book thinking that the author completed this gargantuan task of tackling social justice
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:06.760]   in the angle of the thoroughness of covering that subject.
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:12.600]   I find that no less than remarkable.
[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:19.520]   As a disclaimer, as I conduct this book review for the rest of the episode, I'm going to
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:22.480]   be taking quotes from the book.
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:28.320]   I'm not going to be saying quote each time because I will be saying it way too many times.
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:32.120]   I typically do that in other episodes.
[00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:35.040]   If I'm quoting someone, I'll say quote.
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:38.920]   For the rest of this episode, I'm not going to be doing that because I will be doing that
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:41.240]   every other second.
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:42.720]   It's a book review.
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:45.920]   It's all his work.
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:47.680]   The entirety of it.
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:55.440]   I'm bringing it to you because this is a book review.
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:58.120]   On to the book review itself.
[00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:05.000]   The foreword of this book is written by a former civil rights activist named John Perkins.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:15.320]   John Perkins is one of the few living civil rights activists who was active during the
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:17.360]   civil rights movement and is still alive.
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:21.400]   So if you don't know who he is, insert him into a search engine and you'll quickly find
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:23.600]   out who he is.
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:29.840]   John Perkins writes in the foreword, "I was born on a Mississippi cotton plantation in
[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.400]   1930.
[00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:35.440]   My mother died of nutrition deficiency when I was just 7 months old.
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:40.760]   My big brother, a WWII veteran, was gunned down by a town marshal when I was 17 years
[00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:41.760]   old.
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:47.120]   As a civil rights activist, I was jailed and beaten nearly to death by police.
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:51.800]   They tortured me without mercy, stuck a fork up my nose and down my throat, then made me
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.380]   mop up my own blood.
[00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:55.600]   I have known injustice.
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:15:01.200]   It would have been the easiest thing in the world for me to answer hate with hate."
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:06.200]   He goes on later in the foreword, "We are in the midst of a great upheaval.
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:09.880]   There is much confusion, much anger, much injustice.
[00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:14.640]   Sadly, many Christian brothers and sisters are trying to fight this fight with man-made
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:15.920]   solutions.
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:20.440]   These solutions promise justice but deliver division and idolatry.
[00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:23.520]   They become false gospels.
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:29.440]   Thankfully, in these trying times, new conversations are happening and the right questions are
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:32.600]   beginning to be asked."
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:38.440]   Professor Thaddeus Williams then begins the book by asking the question, "What is social
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:40.440]   justice?"
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:44.480]   What is social justice?
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:48.760]   Every age of church history has its controversies and now the society and the church has our
[00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:49.880]   own.
[00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:53.720]   He writes that in this century, you could learn about social justice auditing a college
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:59.000]   course, joining an activist chapter in our coffee shops, ads for soda, shoes in the Super
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.480]   Bowl, movies, Twitter feeds, national media, and our pulpits.
[00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:07.760]   It is absolutely ubiquitous and it's everywhere.
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:12.080]   While pinning today's situation, the author goes on to note that justice isn't optional
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:13.360]   for Christians.
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:15.760]   It is not optional for Christians.
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:22.480]   Indeed, the author rightly states that to seek justice is a clarion call of scripture
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:29.840]   and those who plug their ears to that call are simply not living by the standard of scripture.
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:36.680]   The Bible's call to seek justice, though, is not a call to superficial, knee-jerk activism.
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:42.280]   We are not to seek justice but to truly seek justice, presupposing that there are untrue
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:44.760]   ways to seek justice.
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:48.360]   We are to hold fast to what is good and test everything.
[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:52.640]   To aid in how the reader should think about the term social justice, the author, Professor
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:59.280]   Thaddeus Williams, proposes to frame the dialectic, we know that word by now, into two positions
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:08.000]   he calls social justice A and social justice B. Social justice A would encapsulate efforts
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   to abolish human trafficking, work with the inner city poor, invest in microloans to help
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:20.560]   the destitute in the developing world, build hospitals, upend racism, protect the unborn.
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:25.080]   Social justice B would be defined as a sort of thing that has taken an extremely charged
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:31.160]   political meaning and has become a waving banner over movements like Antifa, the waving
[00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:36.840]   banner of a disproportionate ratio of professors and universities around the nation where the
[00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:43.200]   oppressor vs. oppressed narrative of deconstructionism is taken as objective.
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:48.980]   Movements with the stated mission where they are trying to disrupt a western prescribed
[00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:53.480]   nuclear family structure, and movements on college campuses that have resorted to violence
[00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:56.680]   to silence opposing voices.
[00:17:56.680 --> 00:18:05.400]   Using social justice A and social justice B, he calls upon Christians to not look down
[00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:12.360]   on those who call for biblical discernment but rather to not be naive to the meanings
[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:21.600]   that have been baked into many minds with the word combination of social and justice.
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:26.360]   The author goes on to state that the problem is not necessarily the quest for social justice
[00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:33.800]   but what happens when that quest is undertaken from a framework that is not compatible with
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:35.760]   the scriptures.
[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:40.560]   Many Christians accept conclusions that are generated from worldviews that are wired with
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:47.400]   very different presuppositions about reality than those we find in scripture.
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:53.280]   We shirk God's commands and hurt his image bearers when we unwittingly allow unbiblical
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:59.240]   worldview assumptions to shape our approach to justice.
[00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:04.280]   Before beginning the book, he lists four disclaimers and they are the following.
[00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:10.560]   Number one, social justice A, the kind of justice that flows from scripture, is not
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:14.540]   synonymous with the republican party or its policies.
[00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:20.780]   Number two, he is not building a straw man of social justice B, and his portrayal is
[00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:28.080]   indeed representative of social justice B. Number three, this book should not be used
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:33.160]   as a billy club to bash brothers or sisters that we disagree with.
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:41.360]   Number four, the book takes aim at ideas and not people and it takes aim at those ideas
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:49.600]   because they hurt people we are called to love.
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:20:00.200]   After reading this portion of the book, my appetite to finish the rest of the book was
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:04.240]   increased dramatically.
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:18.360]   You can tell he's not only hitting the right points, but he understands the knee-jerk reaction
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:28.880]   to reject what Christians might believe to be merely republicanism or merely competing
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:32.800]   theories.
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:37.280]   Here are the 12 questions that he asks in the book.
[00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:38.520]   These are the 12 questions.
[00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:47.720]   He divides it into four parts, and so each of the four parts has kind of a grouping to
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:49.480]   it.
[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:56.920]   Part one is this, Jehovah or Jezebel, three questions about social justice and worship.
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:01.660]   Part one, Jehovah or Jezebel, three questions about social justice and worship.
[00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:04.240]   Number one, the God question.
[00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:11.360]   Does our vision of social justice take seriously the Godhood of God?
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:15.800]   Does our vision of social justice take seriously the Godhood of God?
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:18.260]   Number two, the Imago question.
[00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:24.640]   Does our vision of social justice acknowledge the image of God in everyone, regardless of
[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:29.400]   size, shade, sex, or status?
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:32.180]   Number three is the idolatry question.
[00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:39.040]   Does our vision of social justice make a false God out of the self, the state, or social
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:42.040]   acceptance?
[00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:49.920]   Number two, unity or uproar, three questions about social justice and community.
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:52.480]   Fourth question is the collective question.
[00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:59.560]   Does our vision of social justice take any group identity more seriously than our identities
[00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:02.180]   in Adam and in Christ?
[00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:04.540]   Number five, the splintering question.
[00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:10.200]   Does our vision of social justice embrace divisive propaganda?
[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:12.280]   Number six, the fruit question.
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:18.640]   Does our vision of social justice replace love, peace, and patience with suspicion,
[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:21.560]   division, and rage?
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:29.620]   Part three, sinners or systems, three questions about social justice and salvation.
[00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:32.080]   Number seven is a disparity question.
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:39.300]   Does our vision of social justice prefer damning stories to undamning facts?
[00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:41.400]   Number eight, the color question.
[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:48.400]   Does our vision of social justice promote racial strife?
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:51.400]   Number nine, the gospel question.
[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:57.560]   Does our vision of social justice distort the best news in history?
[00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:05.960]   Last part, part four, truth or tribes thinking, three questions about social justice and salvation.
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:13.000]   Truth or tribes thinking, three questions about social justice and knowledge.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.500]   Number 10, the tunnel vision question.
[00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:21.080]   Does our vision of social justice make one way of seeing something the only way of seeing
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:22.740]   everything?
[00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:27.460]   Does our vision of social justice make one way of seeing something the only way of seeing
[00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:29.120]   everything?
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:31.120]   Number 11 is a suffering question.
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:36.760]   Does our vision of social justice turn the lived experience of hurting people into more
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:37.940]   pain?
[00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:43.360]   Does our vision of social justice turn the lived experience of hurting people into more
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:44.360]   pain?
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:48.640]   The last question, number 12, the standpoint question.
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:56.280]   Does our vision of social justice turn the quest for truth into an identity game?
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:24:02.640]   Does our vision of social justice turn the quest for truth into an identity game?
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:10.960]   The book also lists a pretty robust appendix section that tackles various questions that
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:18.160]   are intriguing and relevant to many, such as abortion and the right to life, capitalism
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:24.640]   and socialism, defining sexuality, fragility and anti-fragility, and an appendix entitled
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:28.200]   — a portion of the appendix entitled Good News to the Poor.
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:35.480]   At the end of each chapter for the 12 questions, he includes a short, often personal story
[00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:39.800]   related to the topic of social justice.
[00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:44.680]   There are 12 chapters, so there are 12 other contributing authors.
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:51.240]   This group is eclectic in nature, and they include people who came out of the woke movement
[00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:54.760]   or are otherwise related to the topic of social justice.
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:56.920]   Many of them are active on social media.
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:01.280]   I've already recommended a couple of them to you, Jamal Bandy, Samuel Tse, Monique Dusson
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:02.880]   are also contributing authors.
[00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:09.360]   They're active on social media, they're also active in the celestial blogosphere.
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:17.840]   So what I'm going to do now is I'm going to pose some of the questions, six of the 12,
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:24.200]   and I'll give you a little snippet from the book of how we answered it.
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:25.600]   Number one, the God question.
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:27.160]   This is the first question.
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:32.160]   Does our vision of social justice take seriously the Godhood of God?
[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:33.520]   The God question.
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:38.520]   Does our vision of social justice take seriously the Godhood of God?
[00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:39.840]   He says this.
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:46.920]   Professor Thaddeus Williams, the author, states, "Paul knows that the human tree is so hopelessly
[00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:52.080]   sick that whatever soil you plant in it, toxic fruit will form.
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:57.320]   No amount of political revolution, social engineering, or policy tweaking will stop
[00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:03.320]   envy, strife, deceit, and maliciousness from sprouting out of our sick hearts.
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:06.480]   Why were all the utopias of the modern era doomed to fail?
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:11.000]   Because the evil did not originate in politics, society, or the economy.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   It is expressed there, but evil originates in human hearts that exchange the glory of
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:23.280]   the immortal God for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and creeping things,
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:28.560]   and the sun and water and gold and sex and power."
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:30.760]   The Imago question.
[00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:36.020]   Does our vision of social justice acknowledge the image of God in everyone, regardless
[00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:39.960]   of size, shade, sex, or status?
[00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:42.120]   There's a snippet from that chapter.
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:46.440]   The author states, "There is a tendency today to reduce people not to bodies but to
[00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:48.200]   ideologies.
[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:54.000]   We don't see a human being so much as we see social justice sylphics to our left and neo-Nazis
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:59.120]   to our right, or we see and treat people on the basis of their skin color or gender or
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:01.280]   whom they want to sleep with.
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:06.880]   That is why giving God his due is so important to real justice."
[00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:10.000]   The Idolatry question.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.800]   Does our vision of social justice make a false God out of the self, the state, or social
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:16.800]   acceptance?
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:22.120]   The author states in part, "The question is, who has the right, the trustworthiness,
[00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:26.880]   the goodness, and the authority to render their verdict about who we really are?"
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:29.480]   Social Justice B answers, "We do."
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:33.320]   Herein lies one of the deepest problems with idolizing the self as sovereign.
[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:38.880]   The omnipotence-demanding task of constructing an entire person's nature is forced onto
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:42.000]   our all-too-shaky, infinite soldiers.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:47.880]   Tragically, we buckle under the impossible weight.
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:48.880]   That was question number three.
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:53.480]   Now I'm going to tackle question number six from the book.
[00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:56.500]   Question number six is the fruit question.
[00:27:56.500 --> 00:28:03.920]   Does our vision of social justice replace love, peace, and patience with suspicion,
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:05.320]   division, and rage?
[00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:09.760]   Does our vision of social justice replace love, peace, and patience with suspicion,
[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:10.880]   division, and rage?
[00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:17.240]   The author states, "The kingdoms of the world play the self-defeating game of tribalizing,
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:22.040]   retaliation, and escalation, running up body counts in the name of justice.
[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:25.640]   The kingdom Jesus invites us into does not play by those rules."
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:30.440]   Corrie ten Boom showed her citizenship in Jesus' kingdom rather than the world's kingdoms
[00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:35.040]   when she extended forgiveness to the Nazi.
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:40.200]   The kingdoms of the world play the self-defeating game of tribalizing, retaliation, and escalation,
[00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:42.360]   running up body counts in the name of justice.
[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:45.640]   The kingdom Jesus invites us into does not play by those rules.
[00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:50.400]   Corrie ten Boom showed her citizenship in Jesus' kingdom rather than the world's kingdoms
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:53.040]   when she extended forgiveness to the Nazi.
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:29:00.640]   If you don't know that story, look up Corrie ten Boom.
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:02.360]   The disparity question #7.
[00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:07.840]   Does our vision of social justice prefer damning stories to undamning facts?
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:11.360]   The author states, "The point is not that there is no such thing as racism or sexism
[00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:15.240]   or other vicious 'isms' wreaking havoc on earth.
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:19.320]   Sinful 'isms' inflict hurt on some people groups that other people groups never have
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:20.480]   to cope with.
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:26.240]   The point is that shouting 'systemic injustice' at every unequal outcome is too easy.
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:31.920]   In a world unlike ours with zero racism or sexism or any other evil 'ism,' there
[00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:40.600]   would still be vast inequalities based on things as boring and undamning as geography,
[00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:49.560]   age, birthdays, birth order, shopping, habits, desire to lay bricks, and so much more.
[00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:56.400]   When we automatically assume damning explanations for unequal outcomes, we not only lock ourselves
[00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:01.320]   in a prison of never-ending rage, but also dull our sense to the point that we will be
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:08.600]   useless for the sacred task of recognizing and resisting the real racism, real sexism,
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:14.480]   and other real vicious 'isms' around us."
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:18.440]   The last question I'll tackle here, the gospel question, that's number 9, the gospel
[00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:19.520]   question.
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:23.880]   Does our vision of social justice distort the best news in history?
[00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:28.440]   Does our vision of social justice distort the best news in history?
[00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:32.160]   The Bible also commands that we tell the truth, that we give generously, that we love our
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:33.680]   neighbor and so on.
[00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:37.900]   None of these commands are optional, yet none of these commands is the gospel.
[00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:41.360]   We should not confuse any of these commands with the first thing.
[00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:46.520]   If we do, then we will not only lose the gospel, but also find ourselves adhering to these
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:50.160]   commands in a way that obliterates their essence.
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:56.360]   Without the gospel first, we become graceless in our truth-telling, cheerless in our giving,
[00:30:56.360 --> 00:31:00.720]   and our neighborly love turns into self-righteous showmanship.
[00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:06.480]   Likewise, when the gospel is not our first thing, social justice becomes something else
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:11.200]   entirely.
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:20.160]   So those are 6 questions out of the 12 in the book, and I've used 6 snippets from the
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:24.920]   book to address those 6 questions that the author asks.
[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:34.600]   As you could probably tell from those snippets, the author's insight is astute, insightful,
[00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:40.960]   and thoroughly grounded in proper theology and reality.
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:49.200]   He really did go into great pains into interpreting reality correctly so that when he did apply
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:56.680]   Biblical truth, we get a corresponding result that is right on the mark.
[00:31:56.680 --> 00:32:02.760]   Interpreting reality correctly does seem to be a lost art, a lacking skill that very,
[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:06.520]   very few have at the moment.
[00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:12.560]   To emphasize its importance, I want to quote to you from 1 Chronicles 12.32.
[00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:22.480]   1 Chronicles 12.42 says this in part, "From the sons of Issachar, men who understood the
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:28.720]   times with knowledge of what Israel should do."
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:42.520]   Here, when you think about what it takes to build a proper kingdom, society, nation, church,
[00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:50.680]   you have to have men who understand the times.
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:56.000]   That is another way of saying interpreting reality correctly, because if you don't, it
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:02.040]   is very easy to take truth and misapply it.
[00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:11.000]   When someone is diagnosed with cancer, I'm not going to give them a Band-Aid.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:19.600]   If someone needs a Band-Aid, we are not going to say, "You should go and get radiation therapy."
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:31.220]   You can see how and why men who understand the times is so very important.
[00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:36.040]   If you are interested in this subject, I hope this episode whetted your appetite for the
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:37.920]   book.
[00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:47.320]   I took the bulk of this episode to do a book review, because as I said in the beginning,
[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:57.560]   I found it remarkable that the author covered this subject in a very thorough manner that
[00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:01.480]   was also very charitable.
[00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:07.040]   That was very impressing to me, which is why I'm saying the same thing yet again at the
[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:09.500]   end of the episode.
[00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:14.560]   Being a self-described signpost theologian, this is one of those moments where I'm absolutely
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:19.920]   pointing those who are interested in that direction.
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:22.160]   Thanks for making it to the end.
[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:26.520]   I'll continue to try to make the journey worth it.
[00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:30.320]   To Him be honor, glory, and eternal dominion.
