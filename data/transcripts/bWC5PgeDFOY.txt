[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.020]   In 1 Kings 18, we read the amazing account
[00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.980]   of God's defeat of Baal's prophets.
[00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.140]   The story is unforgettable.
[00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.640]   At the time, Israel was torn.
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.460]   Should it follow Baal or should it follow the living God?
[00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.040]   And as it stood, the people of Israel were limping
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.040]   between two different options, Elijah says.
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.020]   So came an ultimatum.
[00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.420]   God's people would climb Mount Carmel
[00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.660]   to witness two sacrifices laid out.
[00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.500]   One sacrifice with a bull would be set on logs by Elijah.
[00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.420]   Another bull on logs would be assembled
[00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.660]   by the prophets of Baal, equal offerings.
[00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.220]   Then the prophets would call down divine fire
[00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.940]   to light the sacrifices.
[00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.620]   Baal's 450 prophets went first and called out
[00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.980]   and called out and called out.
[00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.240]   Crickets, nothing from their God.
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.160]   Then Elijah, God's lone prophet on the mountain,
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.800]   on the scene, set up his sacrifice,
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.760]   had it doused with water three times over
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.520]   and then called for God to act.
[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.760]   As we read in 1 Kings 18, verses 36 to 39
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.680]   in the words of Elijah.
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.520]   Oh Lord, God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel,
[00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.860]   let it be known this day that you are God in Israel
[00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.740]   and that I am your servant,
[00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.600]   that I have done all these things at your word.
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.880]   Answer me, oh Lord, answer me,
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.820]   that this people may know that you, oh Lord, are God
[00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.400]   and that you have turned their hearts back.
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.080]   Then the fire of the Lord fell and consumed
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.440]   the burnt offering and the wood and the stones and the dust
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.080]   and licked up the water that was in the trench.
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.280]   And when all the people saw it,
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.160]   they fell on their faces and said,
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:56.160]   the Lord, he is God, the Lord, he is God.
[00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.040]   Powerful.
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.820]   So what's the takeaway of this story?
[00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.480]   We heard it in verse 37.
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.860]   Here it is again.
[00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.020]   That this people may know that you, oh Lord, are God
[00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.020]   and that you have turned their hearts back.
[00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.820]   Verse 37 needs to be thought about.
[00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.600]   And that's what we're gonna do today.
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.820]   After this dramatic event, Elijah goes up to Mount Carmel.
[00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.960]   Here's Pastor John to explain it from there.
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:25.800]   - Verse 42, Elijah went up to the top of the Mount Carmel
[00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.720]   and he bowed himself down to the earth
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.400]   and put his face between his knees.
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.620]   And he said to his servant,
[00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.400]   go up now and look toward the sea.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.000]   And he went up and looked and said, there's nothing.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.700]   And he said, go again, seven times.
[00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.580]   And at the seventh time, he said,
[00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.920]   behold, a little cloud like a man's hand
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.760]   is rising from the sea.
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.640]   And he said, go up, say to Ahab,
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.680]   prepare your chariot and go down,
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.080]   lest the rain stop you.
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.480]   And in a little while,
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.440]   the heavens grew black with clouds and wind.
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.680]   And there was a great rain.
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.420]   And Ahab rode and went to Israel
[00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.760]   and the hand of the Lord was on Elijah.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.120]   And he gathered up his garment and he ran.
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.340]   He didn't limp.
[00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.200]   - You don't limp when you follow Jesus.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.960]   I don't care if you're in a wheelchair.
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.400]   You don't limp when you follow Jesus.
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.240]   You run.
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.080]   - Before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.520]   He ran before the rain.
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.360]   He didn't limp.
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.320]   He didn't hobble.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.000]   He ran.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.900]   Now that's the story.
[00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.560]   Let's step back and ask.
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.940]   So what's the main point?
[00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.360]   The one that everything else is supporting
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.480]   and leading toward.
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.400]   And I mentioned as we were going
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.440]   I think it's in verse 37,
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.480]   because Elijah himself says,
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.920]   this is what I want the people to know.
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:02.760]   Right?
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.560]   I mean, it's just not all stories are this clear,
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.440]   but the prophet himself opens his mouth
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.880]   and gathers the whole thing together and says,
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.160]   God, make them know this,
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.360]   make them know this about all this.
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.360]   So what is that?
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.200]   Verse 37, answer me, Oh Lord,
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.040]   answer me that this people may know.
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.880]   Know what?
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:26.880]   Two things.
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.640]   Number one, that you, Oh Lord are God.
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.800]   You are God.
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.920]   You're not an idea.
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.560]   You're not a memory.
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.840]   You're not a tradition.
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.560]   You're not a religion.
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.920]   You're not a projection of our imagination.
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.720]   You're not a force.
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.320]   You're not an archetype.
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.440]   You're not a symbol.
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.440]   You are God, the living active fire sending,
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:01.240]   sin, hating, idolatry, destroying,
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.200]   prayer, hearing, personal God.
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.200]   That's number one.
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:11.200]   No, make them know, let them know you are God.
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.920]   That's really the basic need of all of us.
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:22.320]   Number two, verse 37, make this people know
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.920]   that you have turned their hearts back.
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.960]   Or the NIV, you are turning their hearts.
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.760]   Cause your people to know this.
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.360]   So this is where I'm landing here.
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.520]   Cause these men to know this.
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:45.480]   I think that's God's will for you from this text.
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.280]   Should be my prayer for you.
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:52.280]   I pray that these men from this story would discern
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.720]   that you, the sovereign God, are the one
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.800]   who turns human hearts to God.
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:06.280]   So their hearts had betrayed God, spurned God,
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.440]   belittled God, devalued God,
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.960]   loved other things more than God.
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.000]   And this entire event on Mount Carmel
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.040]   is aiming to make God's people know
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:24.040]   if anybody turns to God, God turned them to God.
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:27.360]   That's the point of the story.
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.240]   So when the people cry from the heart, verse 39,
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:34.600]   the Lord, he is God, the Lord, he is God, God did that.
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:39.120]   God did that.
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.640]   It's true, the Lord rules the fire.
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:45.520]   It's true, the Lord rules the flesh, the bull,
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.840]   the wood on the altar, the rocks, he rules them.
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.280]   He rules the rain, he makes it rain
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.360]   when he wants it to rain.
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:56.920]   But this text is mainly about God rules the heart.
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:01.000]   He turns hearts, the Lord rules the human heart.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.440]   Answer me, oh Lord, answer me,
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.200]   that this people may know that you, oh Lord, are God
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:11.600]   and that you have turned their hearts back.
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.880]   Know this, Israel.
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.440]   He doesn't want to just say it's a fact.
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:17.920]   He wants them to know it.
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:22.360]   He's praying that God would cause them to know it.
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.080]   There must be a value for you this afternoon,
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.760]   tomorrow, 10 years from now.
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:31.000]   There must be a value for you to know this,
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   that if anybody's heart turns to God,
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.320]   God has turned the heart.
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:38.840]   There must be a value, a thrilling value
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.080]   for you to know this,
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:46.080]   that Elijah would pray it as the capstone of the event.
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:51.080]   Let him know this.
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:54.160]   I mean, there's people all over the world
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.840]   who would say, "Puh, fire falling from heaven,
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:02.080]   "consuming bulls and water and wood and stones?
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.400]   "That's impressive."
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.120]   That's not what he, he didn't pray
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.080]   that they would know that.
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:11.200]   He prayed that they would know if your heart
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:15.400]   at this moment is getting really serious about God,
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.040]   God is doing that.
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:21.320]   And that to me, I mean, as an American
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.120]   who grew up in the South,
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:28.120]   where a kind of decisionism was so dominant and rampant,
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:34.360]   this emphasis was in my childhood never heard.
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:40.800]   When it came to a heart moving from unbelief to belief,
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:44.720]   you do that, you do that.
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:49.720]   Nobody stressed, "God, do it, do it in this room.
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.960]   "If you don't do it, it won't be done."
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:58.440]   That's what Elijah is pleading for.
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.880]   - Powerful, that's a great clip
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.360]   from John Piper's June 2018 message recorded in London,
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.960]   titled "God Rules the Heart of Every Man,
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:08.800]   "Elijah's Battle with the Prophets of Baal."
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.880]   You can find it now online at desiringgod.org.
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:16.440]   The clip was emailed to me by Kat in Rottingham, Virginia,
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:20.320]   who says it was this point, this clip, this Bible text,
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.720]   1 Kings 18.37, that quote,
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:25.800]   "Finally made the doctrines of grace click in my own head,
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.560]   "opening my eyes to a new understanding of God's sovereignty
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:31.120]   "and marked the beginning of a season
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.240]   "God used to draw me nearer to himself
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.800]   "and a greater understanding of his word."
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.000]   Awesome, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.960]   She says, "That's a great story."
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:39.920]   Thank you, Kat.

[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:58.080]   That's our email address, askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:02.100]   Speaking of the power of a single Bible text,
[00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:06.600]   if you have not heard the story of how Psalm 119, verse 99,
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:09.800]   shaped John Piper's entire ministry legacy,
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.560]   you really need to hear what's coming up next.
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:14.340]   That's what we're going to do next time.
[00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:15.800]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke,
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.880]   and we are rejoined in studio with Pastor John on Friday.
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:19.780]   We'll see you then.
[00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:22.360]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.940]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:34.940]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
