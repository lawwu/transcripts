[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.540]   - "How can I balance robust routines and plans
[00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:04.180]   "with enjoying the present moment?
[00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.680]   "Is it possible to be an ambitious high achiever
[00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.020]   "without a baseline level of anxiety?"
[00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.180]   - You know, it's an interesting question
[00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.940]   because coincidentally, I listened to two different podcasts
[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.980]   in the last few days that I think of as giving
[00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.540]   two different perspectives on this question,
[00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.520]   both podcasts by people I know and respect.
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.380]   So let's start with these two perspectives I heard,
[00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.180]   coincidentally, just in the last few days.
[00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.040]   So the first was from Oliver Berkman,
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.220]   who wrote "4,000 Weeks," "Friend of the Show,"
[00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.860]   he blurbs "Slow Productivity," I blurb "4,000 Weeks,"
[00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.000]   and he really has made a name for himself
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.960]   with this sort of much more like British,
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.760]   sort of relaxed re-appraisal
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.360]   of time management and productivity.
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.140]   I was listening to Oliver recently
[00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.740]   on Chris Williamson's podcast, "Modern Wisdom,"
[00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.240]   and Berkman was sort of giving this kind of ideal,
[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.940]   he was like, here's his approach to personal productivity,
[00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.380]   how he thinks about these things right now,
[00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:07.420]   and I'm paraphrasing, but his system was like,
[00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.920]   have a few things you wanna get done,
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.780]   but also be willing to let your interests guide you.
[00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:14.820]   If you don't really have energy
[00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.240]   for this thing you wanna do,
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.860]   but there's something else you're kind of excited about,
[00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.080]   maybe work on that instead, and you'll be okay.
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.660]   That's a paraphrase, but that's sort of a classic,
[00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.060]   like "4,000 Weeks" approach.
[00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.040]   Let's call that the humanistic,
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.860]   call this humanistic personal productivity.
[00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.580]   It's sort of, what are we as humans,
[00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.580]   like what really kind of like fits the way we operate best?
[00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.700]   All right, then, soon after this,
[00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.220]   sort of coincidentally, I was listening to Scott Galloway,
[00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.620]   who we talked about earlier in the show,
[00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.500]   I was just on his Prof G podcast,
[00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.460]   and then I was listening to a bunch of Galloway,
[00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.460]   and I was listening to him on Dan Cenor's podcast,
[00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:53.460]   "Call Me Back,"
[00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.180]   and they were talking about, at the end,
[00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.540]   Galloway's new book,
[00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.940]   "The Algebra of Financial"-
[00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.820]   - Of Wealth. - Of Wealth, right.
[00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.780]   And he was sort of giving his take on life and advice,
[00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.980]   and he sort of, Galloway had this take,
[00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.560]   which is like, look, in your 20s in particular,
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.580]   your biggest resource is your time.
[00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.740]   Like, what you wanna be doing with this
[00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.260]   is really getting after getting good at something valuable.
[00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.180]   'Cause he's like, here's the end game.
[00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.140]   He's like, look, this is a reality that's not good,
[00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.240]   but it's a reality, especially in America,
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.220]   we are not kind to poor people.
[00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.260]   And if you can build up a skill,
[00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.660]   whether it's like knowledge work or in trades,
[00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.420]   you can use this as a foundation of financial security,
[00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.780]   and that's what you want.
[00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.100]   You wanna be able to, when you're upper middle age,
[00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.260]   to be able to take care of your kids,
[00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.380]   to be able to help your parents
[00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.300]   when they get older and sick,
[00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.860]   to not have to worry about,
[00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.380]   to go pursue things you're interested in,
[00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.740]   to not be worried about money, it's like, that's the game,
[00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.020]   and it's hard, and you need to take all this free time
[00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.820]   you have in your 20s, and you need to focus on,
[00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:57.920]   I am gonna get good.
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.620]   So we'll call that sort of pragmatic personal productivity.
[00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.700]   And there's some tension between these two, right?
[00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.960]   Oliver's like, just have a few things to do,
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.900]   and also, it's okay if you don't do those,
[00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.180]   like if your interests take you somewhere else.
[00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.260]   And Galloway is basically like,
[00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.700]   look, if you don't sort of get after it,
[00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.300]   and work really hard to master some good stuff,
[00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.580]   your life's gonna be miserable.
[00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.140]   So we kind of have these two different approaches,
[00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.480]   idealistic, humanistic, and pragmatic.
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.580]   So I think what's going on here is that
[00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.700]   Berkman's approach, I think, matches the human brain.
[00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.100]   Like, this is ideally how humans are wired.
[00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.580]   Like, this is really what productivity is to humans,
[00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.720]   is this much looser, sort of,
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.940]   what am I gonna do right now?
[00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.540]   Well, I need to go hunt this thing,
[00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:43.380]   or we're gonna go forage.
[00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.060]   You're sort of doing one or two things,
[00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.900]   you don't have complicated plans,
[00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.500]   and those plans are also contingent.
[00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.460]   Well, I don't know, it's kind of raining,
[00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:52.540]   so I'm not gonna do this, I'm gonna do this,
[00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:53.900]   or there's a new urgent thing that came up,
[00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.300]   let me work on that before.
[00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.540]   Like, I do think you would be happier
[00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.500]   with the Berkman personal productivity.
[00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.300]   On the other hand, I think Galloway is right,
[00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.280]   that it is really hard to be financially secure,
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.220]   and like, you do have to build up skills,
[00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.700]   and it's hard, and especially when you have
[00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:12.900]   a lot of free time in your 20s,
[00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.940]   like, you probably have to do some grinding, right?
[00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.200]   I mean, because it's hard.
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.840]   It's hard to, in a modern economy,
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.580]   it's hard to convince other people to give you money.
[00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.100]   But you really want people to give you money,
[00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.220]   because without money, things are hard.
[00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.220]   And so, we have to construct a sort of
[00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.580]   artificial relationship with time,
[00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.900]   just for a sort of financial survival,
[00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.120]   for a sort of basic economic security.
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.420]   So, I don't know, maybe our goal
[00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.020]   is you wanna get to a place in life
[00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.260]   where you can have a Berkman-style personal productivity,
[00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:41.980]   and that's gonna require a Galloway-style
[00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.300]   pragmatic personal productivity along the way.
[00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.780]   Maybe Berkman's given us the goal,
[00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.980]   and Galloway's giving us the path you have to take
[00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.280]   to be able to get to something like that goal.
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.200]   But I think, back to the original question,
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.780]   the Galloway-style pragmatic personal productivity can be,
[00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.540]   it doesn't have to be super anxiety-provoking,
[00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.540]   but, you know, it's hard.
[00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.660]   And you have to care about, what am I doing?
[00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.340]   Am I making progress on what matters?
[00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.620]   You have to sort of fight back distractions.
[00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.340]   You have to make time for what's important.
[00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.700]   There's a sort of defensive time management in here.
[00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.340]   I can't let all these distractions encroach so much
[00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:17.660]   that nothing gets done.
[00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.260]   There's a sort of urgency of,
[00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.900]   I have to keep working deeply on the things that matter.
[00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.980]   This is my time to start to get good.
[00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.460]   And some of that's stressful,
[00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.340]   and some of that's sort of anxiety-producing.
[00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.040]   One thing I wanna suggest, not to bring this back to me,
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.300]   but that my new book, "Slow Productivity,"
[00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.340]   maybe gives us like a reasonable roadmap
[00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.860]   for walking this tightrope, right?
[00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.260]   For like, okay, we need to do something
[00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.380]   like Galloway-style personal productivity just to survive,
[00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.300]   but we're attracted to the Berkman-style
[00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.340]   personal productivity.
[00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.460]   Slow productivity sort of helps you split the difference.
[00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.660]   It says, we gotta do the work, we gotta get better.
[00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:53.860]   But let's make sure along the way
[00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.820]   that we're not doing too many things at the same time.
[00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:56.860]   That gets counterproductive,
[00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:58.760]   and it's particularly stressful.
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:59.740]   Let's make sure along the way
[00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.540]   that we're giving ourselves a reasonable amount of time.
[00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:02.740]   We can't procrastinate forever,
[00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.100]   but let's not try to squeeze everything
[00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.100]   into the smallest timeframes.
[00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.860]   Let's work consistently on getting better,
[00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.040]   but we can have variations in intensity,
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.700]   and we don't have to have super unrealistic timeframes.
[00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:14.980]   Slow productivity says, okay,
[00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:18.140]   if we really care about quality in a very specific way,
[00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:19.580]   what's the craft that matters?
[00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.220]   And let me actually work specifically
[00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:22.940]   on training that craft like I would train
[00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:24.940]   to get better at an instrument.
[00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.300]   We're gonna get to that Galloway goal of security
[00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.300]   much easier, we'll get there much faster.
[00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.420]   We're gonna gain much more control over our schedule,
[00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:33.940]   much more autonomy quicker,
[00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.140]   if we're not just working really hard,
[00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.020]   but working hard at the specific goal
[00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.660]   of getting better at something that matters.
[00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:43.060]   Slow productivity, we can think of, in other words,
[00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:46.440]   as a way to navigate Galloway-style personal,
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.160]   his pragmatic personal productivity
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.780]   in a way that minimizes the exhaustion and burnout.
[00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.940]   There's still probably gonna be some anxiety there.
[00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:57.880]   It's hard to do hard things, and the pressure is on.
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.520]   But slow productivity gives us a way to navigate that
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.720]   where not only are we more likely to be successful
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.680]   with getting to the Berkman promise land,
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.400]   but we are going to get there
[00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:11.020]   without it having to be an impossible or unsustainable slog.
[00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:13.900]   I don't believe that we have to grind it out
[00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:18.660]   in a miserable sort of way to get to a sort of security
[00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:20.140]   later in our professional career.
[00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:22.380]   I do think we have to be careful about our time.
[00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:24.260]   I do think we're gonna have to prioritize
[00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:25.780]   like the deep efforts to get better.
[00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:27.860]   I do think we have to have defensive time management
[00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:31.100]   to make sure that other things don't come in and take over
[00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:32.500]   and prevent us from making progress.
[00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:33.980]   And I do think all that's kind of hard,
[00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:35.780]   but it doesn't have to be miserable.
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.300]   So I'm gonna throw slow productivity in here
[00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:41.680]   as the way to follow the Galloway path
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.320]   as nicely and sustainably as possible
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:47.020]   on route to getting to the Berkman promise land.
[00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:50.300]   Both good interviews, actually.
[00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:51.360]   - Yeah, I'll check 'em out.
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:52.560]   - I did "Modern Wisdom" as well.
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.840]   If you're looking for another podcast interview with me,
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:55.720]   I did Chris's show.
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:56.840]   I recorded down in Austin,
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:57.960]   but that came out kind of recently,
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:02.600]   so check that out as well, my interview on "Modern Wisdom."
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:03.760]   All right, who do we have next?
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.800]   Next question's from Adita.
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.080]   I currently work in a startup with long hours.
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.720]   I struggle to find time to sharpen my problem-solving
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.800]   and programming skills.
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.960]   How do I plan weekly and daily sessions
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.500]   such that I can follow my interests pragmatically
[00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.980]   without hampering my performance at the company?
[00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:25.000]   So my best advice here is combine the two objectives.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.240]   So you're in a startup, a big-hour startup.
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.500]   You're gonna exhaust yourself
[00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:32.040]   if you're trying to have a sort of non-trivial,
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:34.640]   deep work-requiring, skill-building sessions
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:35.760]   outside of all the hard work
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.920]   you're already doing for your startup.
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:39.520]   Again, going back to the Galloway vision,
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:40.760]   maybe if you're in your 20s,
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.080]   you kind of have the energy to do this,
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.920]   but I don't know, I'd rather spend the time you do have
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:48.120]   doing other things that are rewarding,
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:51.000]   servicing the other buckets of the deep life.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.460]   So I think the right thing to do here
[00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:56.120]   is start to find ways that you can take on
[00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:58.180]   professional challenges that are useful
[00:08:58.180 --> 00:08:59.640]   for the startup in your career
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:03.060]   that require, in order for you to succeed with them,
[00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:05.520]   for your skills and strategic ways to get better.
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:08.760]   This is almost always the optimal way to do this.
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:10.880]   When you're trying to develop a professional skill,
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.120]   if you can integrate that
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.800]   into your existing professional life,
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.280]   that's almost always gonna be better,
[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:19.000]   as opposed to I'm studying to do this on my own,
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.560]   and then over here I have my job.
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.240]   And there's two reasons why it's better,
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.160]   typically, to integrate them.
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:25.800]   One is it's just more manageable.
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.840]   You're not requiring extra time.
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.880]   It's what you're already doing for your job.
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.180]   Your work to get better at this
[00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:35.400]   is directly helping something you're supposed to be doing.
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.480]   Getting better at the skill
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.400]   will give you immediate rewards.
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:43.720]   There's a course, an online course I do with Scott Young
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:46.720]   called Top Performer about getting better in your career,
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.520]   and this is one of the key ideas in the course,
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:52.560]   is we have you design a professional activity
[00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.720]   that is straight up useful for you
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.720]   and your boss and your job,
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:57.940]   but also is gonna make you get better
[00:09:57.940 --> 00:09:59.600]   at something that's useful to your job.
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.360]   So when you combine it, it's much more manageable.
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.640]   You're not having to find extra time.
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:08.080]   And two, it's much more effective, right?
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:11.160]   There's a general rule of learning new skills
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:15.260]   that is the more close you can get your practice
[00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.620]   to the actual application of the skill you're learning,
[00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:18.460]   the better.
[00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:22.600]   I had this conversation on a podcast the other day
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:25.440]   where they were saying, hey, should I meditate
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.440]   to improve my ability to focus on hard work problems?
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.440]   And I said, well, if you wanna improve your ability
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.760]   to focus on hard work problems,
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:33.960]   practice focusing on hard work problems.
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.280]   Don't do something similar
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.440]   and hope that some of these skills transfer over
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:40.480]   'cause this transference can often be low fidelity
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:41.440]   and not that useful.
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:44.080]   Practice the thing you wanna get better at.
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:47.440]   So if you wanna learn how to program or whatever,
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:49.980]   program-specific things that are useful for your company
[00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:51.960]   don't take abstract programming classes, right?
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:54.480]   So you wanna try to connect what you're doing
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:58.640]   the training to the actual application.
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:02.600]   So that's my advice there is make what you're doing
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:03.860]   an implicit training session.
[00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:05.680]   And I think that'll solve a lot of your problems
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:08.360]   and give you the goal of as you build these new skills,
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:09.800]   giving you more leverage and control.
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.120]   You know, it's what we always talk about.
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:13.240]   You get more control and leverage over your working life
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:15.820]   and you can really take that out for a spin.
[00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:17.360]   - For those interested in the course,
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:18.960]   it's through your newsletter
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.680]   and it opens twice a year, right?
[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:23.000]   - Yeah, I announce it in my newsletters twice a year.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.060]   Scott actually has a new book coming out in May
[00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:28.680]   all about how to learn things,
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:30.320]   like how to learn hard things.
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:33.400]   And I'm setting up for him to come on the show.
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:36.500]   One of the ideas I have is to have Scott
[00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:39.080]   be a sort of like a guest question answerer with me.
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:40.740]   We could do a bunch of questions about learning skills
[00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:43.000]   and him and I can try to answer them together.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.320]   So I'm having Scott, I've known Scott forever.
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:46.880]   I do two courses with him.
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:47.760]   This new book is awesome.
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.160]   So anyways, we'll get more on that with Scott soon
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:51.000]   on the podcast.
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:53.240]   - All right, who we got next?
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:55.200]   - Next question is from Lily.
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.680]   I have lived under a controlling family environment
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.360]   for most of my life where I wasn't allowed
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:02.080]   to have any hobbies or many friends.
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.220]   I'm now living on my own
[00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:05.320]   and I'm struggling to create my own routine.
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:08.120]   I want to live a deeper life, but I feel that it's empty.
[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:10.080]   How can I begin to build a deeper life
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:12.120]   after years of neglect?
[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:13.440]   - Lily, it's a great question
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:15.880]   and I love your thinking about this.
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:18.880]   You know, I love the self-awareness of
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:21.080]   this might be hard for me, but it's important.
[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:23.920]   And I think it's, before we get to the details,
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.600]   the reason why that self-awareness is important
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:29.100]   is because when and if it's hard, and it will be hard,
[00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:31.920]   because again, you were not used to the sort of
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:35.360]   more expansive vision of the deep life growing up.
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:37.240]   When you struggle at first with it,
[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:41.000]   you'll know the struggle is expected and you'll persist.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.880]   Like you'll know this is going to be hard.
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.360]   You're more likely to persist in pursuing depth
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.280]   as opposed to when the first obstacle's coming up,
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:49.160]   just saying maybe I'm not worthy of this
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:50.980]   or maybe this is not something that's going to work for me.
[00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:52.440]   So I love the self-awareness.
[00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:56.080]   I'm going to give a preamble to my advice here.
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:59.920]   My general preamble to this advice is
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:02.640]   probably the biggest danger
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:04.460]   throughout this process of finding more depth,
[00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:07.360]   the biggest danger I want you to be wary of is your phone.
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:10.800]   'Cause what you're trying to do here
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.520]   in building a more expansive depth into your life
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:16.820]   is you're going to try to be servicing more of these areas
[00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:18.880]   that make life meaningful and important,
[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:21.220]   the contemplation, craft, community,
[00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:22.780]   celebration, constitution.
[00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:24.300]   There's gonna be these broad areas,
[00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:28.460]   these elements that make the human life
[00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:29.820]   interesting and important.
[00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:34.940]   The phone can offer you a sort of low,
[00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:39.000]   a high-sugar, low-quality simulacrum of satisfaction
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.460]   for a lot of these areas, right?
[00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:43.340]   But like, oh, you really like desire community.
[00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:45.320]   You don't have a lot of experience having friends.
[00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:48.320]   We can just kind of simulate having friends on the phone.
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:49.880]   Like there's people in social media
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:51.780]   and they're commenting and they're clicking on things
[00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:55.320]   and like that's close enough and it's easy, you know?
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:59.620]   You wanna seek out beauty and interesting things.
[00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:01.520]   You wanna like get engaged in like the world
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:02.680]   of like what humanity can create.
[00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:04.660]   The phone's like, we got interesting stuff on here.
[00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:06.720]   Just like scroll this thing and like it'll just,
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:09.980]   it'll look interesting and binge on these shows.
[00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:11.440]   You know, like what you're looking for,
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.280]   the phone can give you a cheap version of.
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:17.540]   You wanna be, you have a call to a moral intuition.
[00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:20.060]   I wanna be involved, have a moral intuition.
[00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:22.700]   The phone's like, we can just like punch outrage buttons.
[00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:24.380]   Just like look at these tweets.
[00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:27.500]   So the phone is gonna subvert every human instinct you have
[00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:29.260]   as you try to build a more expansive depth.
[00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.140]   So now is the time you need to be super wary of the phone.
[00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:34.020]   Right?
[00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:35.140]   Be very careful what's on there.
[00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:37.360]   Be very careful what services you're doing.
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:39.940]   You might consider temporarily taking social media
[00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:40.860]   off your phone.
[00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:42.700]   You should consider using something like the phone
[00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:44.260]   for your method when you're at home.
[00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.060]   You have it plugged in in a set place in your house
[00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:48.820]   and that's where it stays or in your apartment
[00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:50.180]   and you can go there to reference it,
[00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:52.720]   but it doesn't stick with you as a constant companion.
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.940]   Do things on a regular basis without your phone,
[00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:56.680]   just so you become comfortable being alone
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:57.760]   with your own thoughts.
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:59.620]   You have a lot of actual introspection
[00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:02.020]   you're gonna have to do here, Lily.
[00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:04.020]   A lot of sort of building out your schema
[00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:05.220]   and your understanding of the world
[00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:06.960]   and how you fit into it.
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.380]   This is gonna be a lot of just you with your own thoughts.
[00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:10.860]   So I'm talking about once or twice a week,
[00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:13.500]   long walks without your phones, errands without your phone.
[00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.680]   You have to be very wary of this thing
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.880]   in this very important but vulnerable moment
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:18.940]   you find yourself in.
[00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:23.360]   All right, with that in mind, how do we make progress here?
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:27.260]   Let's go back to the deep dive from earlier in the episode.
[00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.320]   Work on your hardware first
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:32.880]   before you get too caught up in the software, right?
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:35.080]   You've had a very limited, powerful,
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.320]   but very limited type of hardware you've been running on
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:40.080]   because of what it was like growing up.
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:42.380]   You now wanna build out this more expansive hardware.
[00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:44.380]   Let's focus on the boring hardware
[00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:46.240]   before we get into the sexy software.
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:48.840]   So this means you wanna get some control
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:51.440]   over your obligations and time, like we talked about.
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:53.760]   Here's what I'm working on, here's my planning.
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:55.700]   I know what I'm doing
[00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:58.820]   and I have control over what I do and when I do it.
[00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:01.120]   Work on your discipline instruction set.
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:03.280]   I have daily disciplines in these areas of my life,
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:04.680]   including areas that I've never given
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:06.480]   any attention to before, but now I am
[00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:08.880]   because I wanna tell myself I can do things
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:12.000]   that are non-urgent, but are important in the long-term.
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:16.220]   Simplify stuff that's clogging things up,
[00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:17.420]   get automation on the stuff.
[00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:19.060]   I don't think that's your big problem, that piece,
[00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:20.620]   because you're just getting started out,
[00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:21.780]   but get that hardware going.
[00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:23.260]   Trust yourself, I have discipline.
[00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.740]   I can do things in different areas in my life.
[00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:27.440]   I have control over my obligations.
[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:29.940]   I have a pretty reasonable control over my schedule.
[00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:32.100]   Now you can start working on your software.
[00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:34.420]   And here, what I'm gonna suggest
[00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:36.260]   is take one processing unit at a time,
[00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:39.100]   by which I mean one area of your life at a time,
[00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:43.180]   and give it a few months to do an overhaul on it, right?
[00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:45.600]   All right, let's start with, maybe not community,
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:48.280]   maybe we'll start with something like contemplation.
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:51.800]   Okay, I wanna overhaul that part of my life,
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:54.800]   like regular reading habit, meditation habit,
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.720]   rediscovering a sort of religious connection
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:59.120]   and integrating that into my life.
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:01.960]   Let me spend a few months just working on that.
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:04.920]   Okay, now I'm sort of feeling like there's meaning in life
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:07.840]   and I can direct myself towards things that are important.
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:08.680]   All right, now I'm gonna focus
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:10.520]   on community for a few months.
[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:13.700]   How do I start getting a service to my community,
[00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:14.960]   the friends I do have?
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:17.060]   How do I actually, how do I improve those relationships
[00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:17.900]   or meet new people?
[00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:19.980]   And you slowly go area by area
[00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:21.480]   and kind of build up beta versions
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:23.500]   of very basic software in each of these areas.
[00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:26.380]   And then after a year, go back and let's do version one.
[00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:27.600]   You know, now you're gonna iterate on this
[00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:28.440]   and make it better.
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:30.260]   And you can start building up really cool software.
[00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:33.100]   So beware of your phone, upgrade your hardware
[00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:34.960]   so it's ready to handle this full expanse
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:36.220]   of the human experience,
[00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:38.380]   and then start working on your software
[00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:41.200]   in one area of your life at a time.
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.800]   The stakes are low here at first.
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:44.320]   That's why I said beta software.
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:46.960]   I just want some sort of cool program
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:48.440]   after about a year of work,
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:49.820]   running each of the areas of my life.
[00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:52.160]   And now I'm ready to try to come up with the new version.
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:53.600]   And this is gonna take time,
[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.960]   but I'm absolutely convinced that you will get there
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.880]   because you care about it, you know about it,
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:59.080]   you know it'll be hard,
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.680]   and you're committed to actually making change.
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:02.780]   Hey, if you like this video,
[00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:05.440]   I think you'll really like this one as well.
