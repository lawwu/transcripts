[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.860]   All right.
[00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.260]   We got a question here from Taylor.
[00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.660]   Taylor says, how do you count time
[00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.300]   that is in between deep work and deep leisure?
[00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.000]   Well, before I even get your elaboration,
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.340]   my quick answer is, why are you counting time?
[00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:22.460]   Does it matter?
[00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.120]   Let's look at the elaboration, see if we
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.260]   get some more clarity here.
[00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260]   I have a practice of deeply reading and taking
[00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.540]   careful notes on books that have no immediate relevance
[00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.180]   to my scholarly research.
[00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.380]   He's a tenured professor.
[00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.500]   Because I file my notes into a Zettelkasten system--
[00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.340]   oh, man, here we go.
[00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.580]   Zettelkasten corner, take two--
[00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.500]   there is always a chance that my irrelevant notes may one day
[00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.980]   prove useful for my day job.
[00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.060]   Should I count this note-taking time as deep work,
[00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.100]   or do you consider it deep leisure?
[00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.020]   Wondering for the purpose of budgeting my time
[00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.660]   and meeting deep work quotas.
[00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:53.700]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.620]   Taylor, I'd say don't care so much about that.
[00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.260]   I don't think you have to precisely account for this time.
[00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.940]   Is this exactly work, or is this exactly leisure?
[00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.460]   What does matter?
[00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.740]   That you are making regular progress
[00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.500]   on the things that really matter and obsessing over quality.
[00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.460]   We talked about this earlier in the show.
[00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.140]   You have a certain reasonable number
[00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.460]   of projects you're dealing with concurrently.
[00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.740]   You're giving those good attention,
[00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.740]   working on each thing till a natural stopping point
[00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.080]   before switching on to the next.
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.740]   You feel like you're really exercising
[00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.020]   your intellectual muscles.
[00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.540]   You see the progress being made.
[00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.080]   You have the right amount of your time
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.500]   focused on the stuff that really matters.
[00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.260]   Do that, and don't worry so much about,
[00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.540]   like, should that 30 minutes of messing with my Zettelkasten
[00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.460]   slipbox, does that count in some ledger book
[00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.060]   as deep work or deep leisure?
[00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.180]   Don't worry about that.
[00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.060]   When you work, when you work.
[00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.900]   When you're done, when you're done.
[00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.220]   Where it overlaps, it overlaps.
[00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.580]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.160]   (upbeat music)
