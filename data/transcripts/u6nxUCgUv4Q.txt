[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Well our inbox holds at least 50 questions already about Hebrews chapter 6 verses 4 to 6
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   because we get a lot of questions about falling away and losing salvation like this question from Josh.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   Pastor John, a couple of years back I heard you speak on Hebrews 6, "I fear a lot."
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   And your words have not helped my fear because you talked about what it would look like if you, John Piper, were to fall away.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   "I have professed faith and I have been dealing with sexual sin for a long time.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   It manifests itself in my marriage as I acted out on fantasies and committed adultery multiple times.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   My sin was found out of my wife who left me. I spent last summer living as one with the world.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   I slept around and was one of the guys in every respect.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   Nothing could distinguish me as a Christian.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   I've repented and I'm trying to overcome the root sexual sin that caused my downfall.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   I'm getting back into the Word and praying daily.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   I know that my salvation depends on Christ, but would what I have done count as falling away in the context of Hebrews 6 verses 4 to 6?
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   Does my sexual sin mean I cannot be restored to repentance?"
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   Well the short answer is, I don't know.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   I don't know whether your protracted sexual sin will have the effect of preventing you from being restored to repentance.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   And I hope the fact that I don't know will sound to you both sobering and hopeful.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Sobering because it is possible to sin oneself into a condition of inability to repent.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   And hopeful because in Christ Jesus, the worst of sins, the worst of sins will be forgiven if there is authentic repentance in faith in Jesus Christ.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   So let me try to help by giving the bigger picture of the book of Hebrews.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   This book is written precisely to help people, save people, who have made a great beginning in the Christian life.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Described, for example, in chapter 10 verses 32 to 34, "Recall the former days when you were enlightened.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   You endured a hard struggle with sufferings.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   You had compassion on those in prison, and you joyfully accepted the plundering of your property,
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   since you knew that you yourselves had a better possession and an abiding one."
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   That's an amazing beginning in the Christian life.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   They joyfully accepted the plundering of their property for the sake of love.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   They made a great beginning, but now they're starting to drift away, according to chapter 2 verse 1.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   "We must pay closer attention to what we have heard, lest we drift away from it."
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Or chapter 12 verse 12, "Therefore lift your drooping hands and strengthen your weak knees,
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be put out of joint, but rather healed."
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Or chapter 3 verse 12, "Take care, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil, unbelieving heart,
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   leading you to fall away from the living God.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Exhort one another every day, as long as it is called today,
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin,
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   because we have come to share in Christ, if indeed we hold our original confidence firm to the end."
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   So we know that they were born again because they're persevering.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Did you get that from verse 14?
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   We have come to share in Christ if indeed we hold our confidence firm to the end.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   So our perseverance to the end confirms that we were truly in Christ.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   And what's so baffling for many people, and yet so wonderful about this book,
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   is that the strategy of the inspired writer is to lavish the readers with glorious displays of superiority,
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   the superiority of Christ and his salvation for sinners.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   That's one thing.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   And yet, on the other hand, to give the most stark and stunning warnings of destruction
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   if we turn away from this overflowing grace and join Esau by selling our birthright for a bowl of pottage
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   and so prove that we were never in Christ like we saw in 3.14.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   So I strongly encourage anyone who may be stumbling over the warnings of chapter 6 and chapter 10 and chapter 12
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   to read the whole book beginning to end and let yourself be swept up into the superiority of Christ over angels,
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   superiority of Christ over Moses, superiority of Christ over Old Testament priests,
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   superiority of Christ over Melchizedek.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   Let yourself be swept into the fact that his covenant is a better covenant,
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   and his promises are better promises, and his sacrifice is a better sacrifice.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   This book is a volcano, an overflow of spectacular provisions of God through Christ to save the worst of sinners.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   Yes, it is.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   Let this be the primary impact of the book of Hebrews.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   Now, to be sure, the terrible warnings of destruction are there, like Hebrews 12.15.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   "See to it that no one fails to obtain the grace of God, that no one is sexually immoral or unholy like Esau,
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   who sold his birthright for a single meal.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   For you know that afterward, when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected."
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   Why?
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   "For he found no place of repentance."
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   He couldn't repent, "though he sought it with tears."
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   That's the heart of the warning in this book.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   Don't treat the grace of God and the preciousness of Christ and the forgiveness of sins and eternal life
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   with such contempt that you harden your heart to the point where you can't cherish Christ anymore.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   You can't hate sin anymore.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   You can't repent or receive forgiveness anymore.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   The warnings in the book of Hebrews are most fundamentally not warnings about being beyond the reach of grace.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   They are warnings about hardness of heart that cannot receive grace as a precious gift
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   and rest in grace as free and cherish grace as all-satisfying.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   The problem with Esau in chapter 12—and this is the main problem that the writer is dealing with—
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   the problem with Esau in chapter 12 was not that grace and forgiveness were unavailable,
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   but that he had sinned himself into a condition where he could not welcome them
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   as more precious than his bowl of Cheerios, oatmeal, pottage.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   He loved this world so much.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   He loved sin so much that freeness, the freeness and the all-sufficiency of grace
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   couldn't be seen or felt or received as more precious than sin.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   So it says in 12.17, "He found no place, no occasion, no ability of repentance,
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   though he sought it with tears." Not tears of repentance over the ugliness and the distastefulness
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   and the Christ-crucifying evil of sin. No, no.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   His tears were the tears of fearful remorse that refused repentance because of the sin he still loved.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   So, the point of the book of Hebrews—and my point here is not to identify people for whom it's too late.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   That's not what Hebrews is trying to do. That's not what I want to do.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   I don't want to decide for anybody whether it's too late for you.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   I pray, and I hope it's not. I don't believe it is.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   Rather, the point is to say to everyone, just like it does in chapter 3,
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   "Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts, but take care, brothers, lest there be in any of you
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   an evil, unbelieving heart, leading you to fall away from the living God.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   Exhort one another every day, as long as it is called today, that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin."
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   This is a man crying out to a church for whom he believes it's not too late.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   It's not too late if you can do this. Would you do this?
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   Would you not harden your hearts?
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   Or as chapter 10 says, "Oh, do not throw away your confidence, which has great reward,
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   for you have need of endurance, so that when you have done the will of God, you may receive what is promised."
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   It's a sweet pleading to every person.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   It's not too late.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   Turn. Don't harden your heart.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   Maintain your hope.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   Keep your confidence.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   Amen. Thank you, Pastor John, for those sobering words.

[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   How do we pray boldly for things while also honoring God's final decision that his "no" may be the best option?
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   How do we rightly pray in confidence with authority on someone else's behalf for healing, for example, while remaining in full submission to the mystery of God's will?
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   That's a really sharp, good question, and that's on Monday.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke. Have a wonderful weekend. We'll see you back here then.
