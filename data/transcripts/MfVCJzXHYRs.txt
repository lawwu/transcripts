[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Whoever has the Son has life.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   And whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   That's 1 John 5, 12.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.500]   But what exactly does it mean to have the Son of God?
[00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.000]   How do we come into possession of Jesus?
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.500]   And if we don't possess Him, we remain dead in our trespasses and sins.
[00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.000]   So this is one of the most important questions in the universe.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.500]   The answer was expounded by John Piper in a 1985 sermon.
[00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:40.000]   The following sermon clip is also a rare example of Pastor John drawing out metaphors from a contemporary movie.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.500]   A movie titled "A Passage to India" which was released in 1984.
[00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.000]   It's a widely celebrated film, nominated for 11 Academy Awards.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.500]   So again, what does it mean to have the Son of God?
[00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.500]   Here's Pastor John in 1985.
[00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:07.000]   In the film "Passage to India" there was a doctor, an Indian doctor, that is, a doctor who lives in India.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   He was arrested by the British colonial powers,
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   thrown in jail under the alleged claim that he had assaulted a British woman.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:30.500]   The case becomes an extraordinarily tense point of conflict between the people of India,
[00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.500]   who want to be free from the British rule, and the British colonial powers,
[00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:43.000]   who were ruling very insensitively over the Indian people.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   And the whole colonialist power structure seemed to make the doctor's case utterly hopeless.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:58.500]   In jail, no advocate, no money, and they were going to get his flesh.
[00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:05.000]   However, the most famous and able lawyer in India gets word of this.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.500]   He has a reputation for liking to take on the British and for standing up for the Indian underdogs.
[00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:24.500]   And for me, one of the most powerful scenes in that movie was where two friends of the doctor come to him in jail.
[00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.500]   He is utterly dejected and frightened.
[00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.000]   He has no way out and he is surrounded by wolves.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.500]   And their faces are bright.
[00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.500]   They have good news.
[00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:49.500]   And they come to him and say that this lawyer is willing to come and try your case and stand in for you.
[00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.000]   And his face doesn't lift.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.500]   And then they say, "And he won't take a fee!"
[00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.500]   And it transforms the man.
[00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.000]   Now the doctor has a lawyer.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   I say, "He has a lawyer!"
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.500]   The lawyer's thing will now be done for this doctor.
[00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:21.000]   All his eloquence, all his skill, all his reputation will be funneled in one channel.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Liberate this doctor!
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   How did the doctor come to have a lawyer?
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   He was broke.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   He was miles away from this lawyer.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.500]   They didn't even know each other.
[00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:44.500]   And all of a sudden he can declare to all of his British enemies, "I have a lawyer!"
[00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.500]   How did that happen?
[00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.500]   Well it started with the motive of the lawyer.
[00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.000]   This lawyer is interested in two things.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   The liberation of India from the British and the magnification of his skill on behalf of underdogs.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Now I don't know if you remember, I don't know how many of you saw this picture, but another scene that I loved was in the courtroom where there was utter pandemonium.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   It was chaos!
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   And this lawyer was sitting there laid back in his chair utterly composed.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.500]   As though to communicate sovereign control over the situation.
[00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:35.500]   What that lawyer wanted to communicate in the little role he played in that movie was,
[00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:51.500]   "I magnify my skill by not accepting pay for my services, because that might compromise my allegiances."
[00:04:51.500 --> 00:05:00.500]   "I'm for the liberation of India, and I'm for the exaltation of my own skill on behalf of underdog patriots."
[00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.500]   "I don't give a rip about your money."
[00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.500]   And so it is with the Son of God.
[00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:12.000]   How does it come about that you can say, "I have the Son of God"?
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Well it starts with the motive of your divine lawyer, an advocate.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   He has two things that he's after in this world.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   One, the liberation of his people from sin and death.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:31.500]   And the other is the glorification of his power and his skill on behalf of underdog people.
[00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.500]   That's the origin of salvation, that's the source of eternal life.
[00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:42.500]   He loves to show that he loves the liberation of his people and the magnification of his skill.
[00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:48.500]   And therefore, his services are not for sale.
[00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:53.000]   You can't buy Jesus.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.500]   So how do you come to have the Son of God?
[00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:02.500]   He makes you a free offer, and you accept the offer and trust him.
[00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:08.500]   The doctor trusted the lawyer, and the lawyer was willing to stand in for the doctor.
[00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:14.000]   Of course there are at least three ways you can reject the offer of the lawyer.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   He could have done it in the movie, we could do it to Jesus this morning.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   You could say, "I can handle this case by myself. I don't need a lawyer."
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   You could say, "I am a nobody. He's a world-class attorney. He will not come.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   There's no point in responding to the telegram. There's no point in putting trust in him.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   He ain't gonna come. Why would he bother with me?"
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   Or you could say, "Sure, I'll trust him. Let him come.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   But he better not tell me to do anything stupid in that courtroom because I'm not gonna do it."
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   There are people here this morning who need to have the Son of God.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   And you can have, have the Son of God, if you won't use any of those three escape devices.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   So let me just show you why you shouldn't use those three.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   Don't say, "I can handle this case by myself. I can handle my life by myself.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   I was talking to a man the other day who was dealing with a man who had cancer
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   and trying to witness to him in the hospital and the man said, "I can handle this by myself."
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   John Boleyn, 8 o'clock yesterday morning, couldn't handle it.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   And when you get there, you won't either.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   If you don't have an advocate, if you don't have the Son, it's over.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   You'll stay in that jail or go to the gallows, period.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   You can't handle life on your own, no matter how strong you feel right now.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   You see, that poor guy was innocent and he was about done for.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   We're guilty. We are done for.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   Our advocate better be a lot better off than the one in the movie
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   because he's got to pull off a miracle because we are guilty and the judge is just.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   Second, don't say to yourself, "I'm a nobody. He'll never come. Why would he bother with me?
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   I mean, I've committed so many sins. I've failed so many times. He is a world-class God.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   There's no reason why he would bother with somebody like me."
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   Now, the reason you shouldn't say that is not because you're not a nobody,
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   but because you don't understand grace.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   Jesus Christ speaks like this. He says to you, "I don't come to you because you're somebody.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   I come to you because I'm somebody and I like to glorify my somebody-ness by helping nobodies like you.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   So quit thinking you've got to measure up. The only people I help are nobodies.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   If you think you're somebody, you don't qualify.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   The good news, people, is the lower you have gone, the better candidate Jesus thinks you are
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   because he can congratulate himself or magnify himself in the world
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   by pulling off the most amazing trial upset imaginable.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   If you're not very guilty, any lawyer can handle that.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   But let's put that one aside. Sure, you're a nobody. That's the point.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   And he's ready. And don't say, "Oh, sure, I'll trust him. I'll take the offer. Let him come.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   He just better not tell me to do anything stupid in the courtroom because I ain't going to do it."
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   Brothers and sisters, that is not trust.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   You can't keep a lawyer that way.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   Maybe one time you could say it to a lawyer. You say it to a stage two times,
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   "I don't take your advice. I've got a better idea." He'll say, "You get another lawyer."
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   Brothers and sisters, don't evade the summons to trust by just going halfway and saying,
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   "Sure, I'll take the bail, but not the advice."
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   You're not trusting him if you say that.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   So I close this morning by simply holding out to you the free offer that comes from this world-class Son of God
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   who can stand in for you and will stand in for anybody who trusts him.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   He who has the Son has life, and you can have the Son if you trust the Son.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   Hard to find a better illustration of Christ magnifying himself in the salvation of sinners
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   and all for their shared joy together.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   Great stuff.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   This excerpt is taken from John Piper's sermon from June 9, 1985.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   It's titled, "He Who Has the Son Has Life," and you can find the entire thing online at DesiringGod.org.

[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   What is grace?
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   How do we define it?
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   It seems like such a simple question, and it's actually got a lot of angles to it,
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   as we will see next time on Friday.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   I'm your host, Tony Garenke.
