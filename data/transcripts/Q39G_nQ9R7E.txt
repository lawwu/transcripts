[00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.920]   - Good afternoon.
[00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.880]   It is such a joy to be with you all.
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.520]   I am so thankful, not only to proclaim the word of God,
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.020]   but to sing with you all.
[00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.100]   I think there are so many evidences and illustrations
[00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.640]   of truth triumphing as we walk through
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.640]   the text of scripture, but one of them is us being together
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.400]   and us singing together and the weight of one voice
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.920]   crying out the same truth.
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.880]   Though we are scattered to the ends of the earth,
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.400]   we can come together and declare in one accord
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.380]   the universal, eternal truth of the word of God in song.
[00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.940]   That is indicative that truth has triumphed.
[00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.440]   That truth has triumphed to the ends of the earth.
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.940]   It has gone not only far and wide, but deep into the soul
[00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.840]   to regenerate the heart so that we all have
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.440]   the same affections and we all love the same Christ
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.560]   and he means to us the same thing
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.780]   who occupies the greatest love of our heart.
[00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.000]   It's an honor to be with you brothers.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.720]   We are a band of brothers together
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.840]   and that bond is indicative that truth triumphs.
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.640]   Never forget that.
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.560]   Well, shall we dedicate this time to the Lord?
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:41.280]   Our God and Father, may it be that even now
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.080]   you instill in our heart a burning desire
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.940]   for your name to be honored,
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.880]   for the things of this world to grow dim,
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.880]   and for the bright glories of heaven to be exalted,
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.480]   and that your son will be put on high,
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.600]   higher than he ever has been in our hearts and our souls.
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.520]   And we ask this not for our own sake,
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.520]   but for the sake of your son through whom and for whom
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.800]   are all things ordained, that he would be magnified,
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.480]   that he would be accentuated,
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.400]   that the heights of his glory and the depths of who he is
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.160]   would be able to be expounded into our finite
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.800]   and limited minds, and that every fiber of our being
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.120]   would be captured unto him now.
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.600]   And that we would love him and love your plan
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.600]   and know all of your promise and thereby persevere.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.400]   Persevere unto a great moment
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.120]   when heaven declares to the earth
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.100]   the worthiness of the one who has always been worthy.
[00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.360]   And so may this time, O God, be one of great worship.
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.880]   Grant us clarity of speech and clarity of thought
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.520]   so that you would be honored
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.240]   the way you always have deserved to be honored.
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.280]   And we ask this in your name, amen.
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.360]   When we think about the matter of perseverance,
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.600]   there are several principles that we could talk about
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.600]   that fortify our soul to endurance.
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.640]   But one of the keys to perseverance,
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.800]   one of the keys to perseverance is this reality,
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.440]   that truth triumphs.
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.000]   Well, what do you say to yourself
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.320]   when you face setback and discouragement and adversity?
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.680]   Well, what do you say to yourself in trial?
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.760]   Well, what we don't do in trial
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.260]   and what we don't do in discouragement and setback
[00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.080]   is look to ourselves, to our own resources,
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.700]   to our own wisdom, our strength, our ability, our scheming.
[00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.800]   That's a recipe for disaster
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.640]   because we're just not that inspiring in those moments.
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.720]   And to be even more frank,
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.080]   we're probably the reason half the time
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.640]   that we are in those difficulties.
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.480]   No, brothers, we don't look to ourselves.
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.180]   We look to Christ.
[00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.760]   We look to his glory.
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.280]   We look to his majesty.
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.760]   We look to his person.
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.280]   We look to the one who has gone before us,
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.200]   the one who has gone to the cross
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.920]   and one who has gone to death
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.560]   and overcome death in the resurrection
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.560]   and the one who will return and overcome all things.
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.680]   Truth triumphs.
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.160]   And that is what compels us
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.080]   in the hardest of circumstances
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.160]   to say with all of our might,
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.920]   though this moment might be formidable
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.040]   and it might be fearsome,
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.560]   this does not have the last say our God does.
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.680]   And his word is final.
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.480]   What do we tell ourselves?
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.400]   We tell ourselves in those moments
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.000]   and steel in our heart, truth triumphs.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.640]   That's the secret to perseverance.
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.520]   And my responsibility this afternoon
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.380]   is to take you to the moment,
[00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:27.280]   the initiation of the moment where truth triumphs.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.580]   Turn with me to Daniel chapter seven.
[00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.320]   Daniel chapter seven.
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.240]   Now as you turn there,
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.240]   you might be wondering,
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.000]   how do you know that this is the moment
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.960]   that truth triumphs?
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.520]   How is it really that this text is so compelling?
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.200]   And perhaps some of you are still wondering
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.120]   about the underlying assumption,
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.640]   is it really that truth triumphs
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.440]   can persevere and preserve the soul?
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.100]   Can it really facilitate endurance?
[00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.960]   The answer to all these questions
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:02.960]   can be found in nothing other than the life of Daniel.
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.760]   Think about this for a second with me.
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.600]   Daniel's life is absolutely remarkable
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.820]   if you stop and think about it.
[00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:13.360]   Throughout the whole scriptures,
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.560]   we know that the Bible portrays human characters
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.920]   from Abraham to Moses to Peter and Paul,
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:22.020]   both with the good and the bad,
[00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.400]   so that you have a circumspect perspective
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.720]   about these individuals.
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.860]   But it is absolutely then astonishing
[00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:34.860]   that scripture portrays Daniel purely in his integrity.
[00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:38.980]   That is the only comment that the scripture gives
[00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:41.860]   on this man.
[00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:45.180]   And indeed, if you think about this person,
[00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.180]   he is uncompromising to God.
[00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:48.420]   He is consistent.
[00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:49.900]   He is faithful.
[00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:51.540]   He is unwavering.
[00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:54.020]   He is absolutely dedicated.
[00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:56.760]   And he is that even in the most difficult,
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.020]   the most threatening,
[00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:01.220]   the most life-threatening of times.
[00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:03.260]   When there is risk and there is danger,
[00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.980]   he is still steadfast.
[00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.900]   Sometimes we say, "Man, my life's so hard.
[00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.020]   "It's like they're throwing me to the lions."
[00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.260]   Daniel was thrown to the lions.
[00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:18.460]   The guy's existence invented the phrase.
[00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:24.500]   You know, when Daniel was eight or 10 or 12 or 13,
[00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.580]   depending on how you wanna do the dating of Daniel one,
[00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:32.100]   he was more mature than the entire internet combined.
[00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:34.500]   (congregation laughing)
[00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.620]   I know, that's a low bar, but you understand my point.
[00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:43.260]   Daniel's life is so remarkable that in Daniel six,
[00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.180]   when his enemies put him under the microscope,
[00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:47.540]   the highest scrutiny,
[00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.740]   all that they could find out about him
[00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:53.700]   was that he was loyal and faithful to his God.
[00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:56.140]   That is astounding to think about,
[00:07:56.140 --> 00:08:01.140]   that his dedication is so unwavering and so unrelenting
[00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:04.500]   that he had a faithfulness
[00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:07.780]   that eradicated all moral liabilities.
[00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:11.100]   And the only thing his opponents could see in his life
[00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:13.580]   was the only thing in his life,
[00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:15.800]   the loyalty to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.580]   That is an astounding life.
[00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:21.760]   And it would be amazing if he had that for a week.
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:26.760]   I would want that for a week or a month or years.
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:30.280]   But the scripture is clear.
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:34.080]   Daniel lived like that under the microscope in danger,
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:37.240]   within political intrigue, with political schemes,
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.560]   in different kingdoms, in different empires,
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:43.520]   in different regimes, day in, day out,
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:46.440]   every day of his life for over 80 years.
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:50.820]   And no one ever saw him change from that.
[00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:56.180]   That's an amazing life, an amazing life.
[00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:57.380]   I want a life like that.
[00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:01.580]   And the question is, what made him tick?
[00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:04.500]   What made him do that?
[00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.100]   What drove him?
[00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:09.220]   What held him in those moments
[00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:12.460]   when there is so much danger surrounding him?
[00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:14.020]   What did he think about?
[00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:16.940]   What was his motivation?
[00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:18.740]   We don't have to speculate.
[00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:20.620]   We don't have to speculate.
[00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:22.740]   It's Daniel chapter seven.
[00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:23.740]   You say, how do you know that?
[00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:25.460]   Well, here's one way to think about it.
[00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:30.460]   Daniel seven is the point of all of Daniel's thinking.
[00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:34.300]   Daniel seven is the point of all of Daniel's thinking.
[00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:36.260]   Daniel, in the book of Daniel,
[00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:40.900]   has been narrating an argument that God is still sovereign.
[00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:43.460]   God is still sovereign, chapter one of Daniel,
[00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:45.580]   even when Israel is sent into exile
[00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:49.220]   as evidenced by the life of Daniel and his friends.
[00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:51.620]   God is still sovereign in Daniel chapter two
[00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:55.380]   because God alone is the one who ordains dreams
[00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:56.580]   and can interpret them.
[00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:59.380]   And this dream dictates the course of history
[00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:00.700]   of all the world.
[00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:03.540]   God is still sovereign in Daniel chapter three,
[00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:06.180]   even when Nebuchadnezzar challenges the plan
[00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:08.660]   that is revealed in Daniel chapter two.
[00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:11.440]   And in Daniel chapter four, God is still sovereign
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:14.100]   when Nebuchadnezzar doesn't just challenge God's plan,
[00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:15.900]   he challenges God himself,
[00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:19.580]   assuming that his Nebuchadnezzar was a self-made man
[00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:22.900]   and God shows him, if I'm not sovereign over you,
[00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:24.740]   if I'm not the one who dictates it,
[00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:26.720]   you'll just eat grass like an animal.
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.660]   God is still sovereign.
[00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:31.440]   God is still sovereign in chapter five
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:34.260]   as one kingdom gives way to another kingdom
[00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.260]   and just as God had prophesied and planned.
[00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.060]   And in Daniel chapter six, God is still sovereign
[00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:42.140]   in a new regime with new dangers,
[00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:44.940]   but nevertheless, the same God rules.
[00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:46.420]   God is still sovereign.
[00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:49.660]   And so God has shown chapter after chapter after chapter
[00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:52.580]   a progression that every king and every kingdom
[00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:54.820]   and every plan and every nuance
[00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:56.940]   is under the sovereign dictate of God.
[00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:59.220]   He is still sovereign and therefore,
[00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:02.440]   all of God's plan is moving through all of history
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:06.940]   to a point, to an outcome, Daniel chapter seven.
[00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:09.280]   Daniel seven is the outcome.
[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:12.860]   It is the point of everything Daniel has been thinking
[00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:16.500]   and everything flows to it and everything flows from it.
[00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:18.220]   But here's another way to think about it.
[00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:21.140]   The book of Daniel was not written chronologically
[00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:25.880]   and there are 12 chapters in the book of Daniel
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:30.820]   and guess what chapter is right in the middle of the book?
[00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:33.760]   Daniel chapter seven.
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:36.980]   Why is it in the middle of the book?
[00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:38.420]   It's really simple.
[00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:40.820]   It's central to the book
[00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:43.140]   because it's central to Daniel's soul.
[00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:47.880]   Daniel tells you what is his heartbeat.
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:50.800]   Daniel tells us what he prizes.
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:55.660]   Daniel explains to us what is at the center of his own heart
[00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:58.460]   and what he thought about and what he looked forward to
[00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:01.020]   and what captured him and what drove him
[00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:03.620]   in all of the trials and all of the opposition
[00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:06.620]   and all of the danger so that day after day after day,
[00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:09.940]   he would persevere and endure in faithfulness.
[00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:11.660]   It is Daniel chapter seven.
[00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:12.500]   Why?
[00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:15.780]   Because this is the moment that truth triumphs.
[00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:18.860]   This is the moment Daniel was waiting for
[00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:22.260]   and it captured his life to the very end.
[00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:27.180]   Now, we use that phrase, the moment we've been waiting for
[00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:30.180]   in all kinds of ways, very often in life.
[00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:34.220]   Kids will use it for holidays, for birthdays and Christmas
[00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:36.500]   because that's when they get presents.
[00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:38.260]   And students will use this is the moment
[00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.820]   I've been waiting for to talk about graduation
[00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:43.380]   or getting married or getting a job.
[00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:46.060]   And people will use that term when they have a job
[00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:47.980]   to talk about getting a promotion.
[00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:49.860]   And adults will use that term,
[00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:51.960]   this is the moment we've been waiting for
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:53.980]   when they become parents and have children.
[00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:55.580]   And then they'll also use that term
[00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:59.440]   when their children leave and when they become grandparents.
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:03.340]   People use this term all the time.
[00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:05.780]   You may have a moment you are waiting for.
[00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:07.420]   It's called dinner.
[00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:09.780]   (congregation laughing)
[00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:12.140]   We all have moments that we are waiting for
[00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:14.940]   and they compel us, they drive us,
[00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:19.260]   they give us perspective, they give us determination.
[00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.940]   That's the nature of a moment you are waiting for.
[00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:25.700]   And while we may have many moments we are waiting for,
[00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:28.020]   here's what Daniel says about Daniel 7.
[00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:29.120]   This is the moment.
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:32.660]   This is the moment you are waiting for.
[00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:35.040]   This is the moment that truth triumphs.
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:38.100]   This is the moment you are waiting for.
[00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:42.340]   And Daniel in Daniel 7 provides three realities,
[00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:46.700]   three realities that help us to understand this moment
[00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:48.700]   and help us to understand this moment
[00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:51.020]   as the moment that truth triumphs,
[00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:52.940]   the moment that we are waiting for,
[00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:55.520]   and the moment then that we go back to
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:14:00.060]   over and over and over again like Daniel did
[00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:02.860]   so that we would persevere to the end.
[00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:05.200]   Truth triumphs through promise.
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:07.600]   Truth triumphs through prophecy.
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:11.340]   And that's what we have right here in Daniel 7.
[00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:16.340]   Three realities in Daniel 7, 1 through 14.
[00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:20.660]   And with this in mind, let's talk about the first
[00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:23.180]   of those three realities.
[00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:28.480]   This is the moment that history waits for.
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:31.120]   This is the moment that history waits for.
[00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:36.040]   And we see this in verses 1 through 8, 1 through 8.
[00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:39.060]   Immediately in this vision, what we understand
[00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:40.760]   is that this vision was revealed
[00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:42.860]   with a design toward perseverance.
[00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:46.220]   In the first year of Belshazzar, king of Babylon,
[00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:49.740]   this is a moment that is after Daniel chapter 2,
[00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:53.060]   but before, of course, the kingdom of Babylon falls.
[00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:56.940]   The advent of Belshazzar, king of Babylon,
[00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:59.700]   was marked by tremendous instability,
[00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:01.760]   tremendous political intrigue,
[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:05.340]   and therefore tremendous danger to Daniel's life.
[00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:08.420]   And so God reveals a vision to Daniel
[00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:11.220]   in order to give him absolute assurance
[00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:12.940]   that God's plan is going through,
[00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:15.860]   to give him absolute stability in the storm.
[00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:19.940]   This vision is all about instilling endurance.
[00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:22.940]   And within this, this vision is the vision of visions,
[00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:24.580]   as verse 1 recounts.
[00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:27.000]   Daniel saw a dream and visions.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.340]   This vision is so powerful because it sums up,
[00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:33.520]   it brings together all the dreams and visions that he's had.
[00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:35.880]   And in fact, this vision is so much of a vision,
[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:37.200]   it's not just one vision,
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:41.760]   it's visions, plural, in his head as he laid on his bed.
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:45.160]   This vision is so captivating, this vision is so central,
[00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:48.720]   that Daniel ensures that he wrote the dream down
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:51.240]   in perpetuity to preserve it.
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:53.640]   And he also made sure to not only give
[00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:56.900]   every single detail about it, but the summary of the matter,
[00:15:56.900 --> 00:16:00.880]   so that everyone knew every detail and what it all meant.
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:02.920]   This is an epic vision.
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:06.680]   This is the vision that is determining of all visions.
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:10.240]   This is central to divine revelation.
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:13.320]   And in thinking about this then,
[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:14.920]   there's a question that arises.
[00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:18.600]   And what arises is, if this vision is supposed to be
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:21.460]   the summary of all other visions, bringing them all together,
[00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:25.080]   why doesn't Daniel 7 just match other visions
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:28.380]   in the book of Daniel, like in Daniel chapter 2?
[00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:31.140]   For example, there's a lot of correlations between them.
[00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:32.960]   We know that they're parallel.
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:34.820]   Daniel 2 has four metals.
[00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:36.720]   Daniel 7 has four beasts.
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:40.900]   Daniel 2 has a fourth metal that has 10 toes.
[00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:43.800]   And in Daniel 7, you have 10 horns.
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:46.700]   And there's a metal in Daniel 2 with iron.
[00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:50.020]   And in Daniel 7, it describes a beast with iron teeth.
[00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:53.240]   There's absolute correspondence between these two visions.
[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:57.280]   So, why couldn't Daniel be a little bit more American
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:00.360]   and just make them totally match in parallel?
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:02.480]   It'd just make our lives a lot easier.
[00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:07.440]   And the answer is in the imagery itself.
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:08.480]   Think about this with me.
[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:10.280]   Survey this text with me.
[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:15.280]   You have the wind, the sky of heaven, and the sea, verse 2.
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:18.640]   And then you have great beasts coming.
[00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.440]   And then after you have the great beasts coming,
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:22.640]   you have a man who rules over it all.
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:25.020]   Where do you have in the Bible
[00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:27.160]   that there's a mention of the sky,
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:28.880]   and then there's a mention of the sea,
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.600]   and then there's a mention of animals,
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:34.240]   and then there's a mention of even the creation of man?
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:37.320]   Genesis chapter 1.
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:42.020]   Daniel 7 is meant to match Genesis chapter 1,
[00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:47.280]   because the end will be just like the beginning,
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.400]   and more to the point.
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.880]   Genesis 1 has made a thesis.
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:55.320]   Genesis 1 has said, this is the way the world was made,
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:58.160]   and there is a man who is destined, Adam,
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.520]   to rule over this world.
[00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:03.720]   And the question that has been raised is a vital question.
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:07.080]   Who will fulfill Genesis 1?
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:10.240]   Who will fulfill the destiny of creation?
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:13.700]   Who will be the last Adam?
[00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:17.800]   And Daniel 7 is answering that question.
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:22.160]   Daniel 7, in the end, is showing who will fulfill the role
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:26.060]   of the one ordained from the beginning.
[00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:28.520]   And so the world, in its history,
[00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:31.560]   will present the top four candidates, shall we say,
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:36.560]   the top four propositions of who might be this final Adam.
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:41.760]   And it is four beasts, as Daniel 7, verse 2 discusses.
[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:42.920]   Daniel answered and said,
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:44.540]   "I was looking in my vision by night,
[00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:46.040]   "and behold, the four winds of heaven
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:47.340]   "were stirring up the great sea,
[00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:50.280]   "and four beasts were coming up from the sea,
[00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:52.440]   "different from one another."
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:54.800]   Top four, top four.
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.360]   Here's the first one.
[00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:58.920]   Here's the first one, verse 4.
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:00.780]   "The first contender was like a lion,
[00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:02.320]   "and had the wings of an eagle.
[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:04.080]   "I kept looking until its wings were plucked,
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:05.160]   "and it was lifted up from the ground
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:06.840]   "and made to stand on two feet like a man,
[00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:09.320]   "and a heart of a man was given to it."
[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:11.720]   This should sound familiar in context.
[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:15.840]   Who was like an animal, and then God restored his sanity?
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:18.320]   It is none other than Nebuchadnezzar.
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:19.480]   We know that.
[00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:21.640]   This is a description of Nebuchadnezzar.
[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:23.120]   He is that contender.
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:26.200]   He is the king, and this is representative of the nation,
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:30.020]   then, and the kingdom of Babylon, verse 4.
[00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:33.640]   But herein, if you understand that,
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:36.840]   lies an important lesson and irony.
[00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:40.960]   Here you have the symbol, the mascot of Babylon.
[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:43.500]   You even see in an archeological reliefs
[00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:45.960]   a lion, royal and regal,
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:48.000]   and having the wings of an eagle,
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.360]   swift and powerful.
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:54.600]   But when Nebuchadnezzar actually becomes that,
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:56.960]   because he does in Daniel 4,
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:58.940]   he gets on all fours,
[00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:01.560]   he starts growing hair like fur,
[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:05.040]   he has talons and pinions like an eagle.
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:08.920]   That isn't the ultimate epitome of power
[00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:11.800]   and majesty and swiftness and royalty.
[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:13.740]   When Nebuchadnezzar looks like that,
[00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:18.040]   that's the pinnacle of foolishness and folly.
[00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:19.960]   And here is what you learn,
[00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:21.580]   the height of man's power,
[00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:23.900]   what man thinks is so mighty,
[00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:26.280]   what man thinks is so exalted,
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:30.200]   what man thinks is so immensely strong.
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:32.720]   When God actually has that,
[00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:37.220]   when God actually sees that and observes that
[00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:39.160]   and causes it to take place,
[00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:41.360]   what ends up taking place is this,
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:43.720]   it is just foolishness before God.
[00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:45.800]   That's the strength of man.
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:47.320]   That's the strength of man.
[00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:51.000]   And even more, God makes the point,
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.420]   if it wasn't for God,
[00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:55.280]   you would just be a beast.
[00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:59.840]   The difference between you and might and insanity
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:02.880]   is not this vast line of our power
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:04.920]   and our wisdom and our might,
[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:07.740]   no, it is the thin line that God says,
[00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:10.800]   you are this or not, that's it.
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:12.120]   And so Nebuchadnezzar,
[00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.280]   though one of the top four contenders,
[00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:16.480]   he goes off into the annals of history
[00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:18.360]   as one not the final man,
[00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.080]   one not the final Adam,
[00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:22.440]   instead, he's just an illustration
[00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:25.720]   of God's definitive sovereignty.
[00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:27.260]   That God is the definition,
[00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:28.900]   God is the defining factor
[00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:30.920]   of whether you make it or you don't,
[00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:33.000]   whether you're like an animal or not,
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.560]   and that's it.
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:35.680]   So the first guy's out,
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:37.560]   what about the second one?
[00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:39.860]   He comes afterwards, behold, another beast,
[00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:41.160]   the second one, verse five,
[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:42.440]   in the likeness of a bear,
[00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:45.360]   and it was raised up on one side.
[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:48.440]   This corresponds exactly to what you see in Daniel two,
[00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:51.480]   where the next metal, the next material,
[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:54.880]   is corresponding to the shoulders of a statue.
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:58.260]   You have this binary pair in verse five as well,
[00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:00.120]   raised up on one side.
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:02.080]   And the reason that there's this couplet,
[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:03.960]   the reason that there is this pairing
[00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:07.760]   is because you have a confederation in this nation,
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:11.440]   Medo-Persia, Medo-Persia and its king.
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:15.440]   And the Bible is so amazingly precise in this way,
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:18.440]   and then the Bible continues such prophetic precision.
[00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:20.240]   Notice the next part of verse five,
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:22.200]   and three ribs were in its mouth.
[00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:25.840]   Those three ribs are Babylon, Lydia, and Egypt.
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:27.880]   Babylon, Lydia, and Egypt.
[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:30.720]   That's exactly the nations that Medo-Persia
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:33.460]   had to conquer to ascend into power.
[00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:37.740]   The Bible knew these things way before they ever happened.
[00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:41.060]   The three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth,
[00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:46.060]   and thus they said to it, "Arise, devour much meat."
[00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:50.280]   Medo-Persia conquered far more than Babylon ever did.
[00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:53.220]   It went to Egypt, it went to Central Asia,
[00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:55.220]   it even tackled Greece.
[00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:56.700]   And on the one hand, it illustrates,
[00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:59.020]   there will always be somebody better than you.
[00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:01.380]   There will always be somebody better than you.
[00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:03.540]   Babylon, and those in Babylon at the time of Daniel
[00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:04.380]   needed to know that.
[00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:07.340]   They thought they were the top empire of the world,
[00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:09.660]   and indeed, up to that time in history, they were.
[00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:10.900]   But there's always somebody better.
[00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:12.460]   There's always someone who's gonna conquer more.
[00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:14.340]   There's always somebody gonna be doing more.
[00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:15.620]   Be humble.
[00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:18.060]   But on the other hand, brothers, pay attention.
[00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:19.600]   Look at the text carefully.
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:21.140]   Notice what it says.
[00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:26.140]   And thus, they said to it, "Arise, devour much meat."
[00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:29.100]   Who's the they?
[00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:34.940]   Who's telling this bear, this nation of Medo-Persia,
[00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:37.220]   to do what it does?
[00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:39.380]   This they is heaven.
[00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:41.920]   This is heaven.
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:43.380]   And this is a reminder.
[00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:47.980]   Do you want to know why people can do what they do
[00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:50.020]   and go as far as they go?
[00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:54.440]   It is because God says, "Go here and no further."
[00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:58.900]   God is the determiner of everything and all the extent
[00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:02.860]   and all the success or even the failures of one's life.
[00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:06.820]   God says, "Go here and no further," not just to the sea,
[00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:10.380]   but to every single human and to every single king
[00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:13.020]   and to every single kingdom.
[00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:14.620]   We might be impressed with people,
[00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:16.380]   and we might think that they're self-made people,
[00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:17.940]   but that is not true.
[00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:21.180]   They only go as far as God tells them to,
[00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:23.540]   no further and no less.
[00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:25.860]   God not only has defining sovereignty,
[00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:29.700]   he uses the second beast, the kingdom of Medo-Persia,
[00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:33.000]   to show that he has determining sovereignty.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.700]   Well, that beast didn't work out either.
[00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:37.000]   So what about the third one?
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.120]   There's another one.
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:39.500]   Verse six.
[00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:41.540]   "After this, I kept looking and behold another one,
[00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:43.320]   "like a leopard, which had on its back
[00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:44.760]   "four wings of a bird."
[00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:47.420]   This is the mascot of Greece.
[00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:49.580]   This is exactly the nature of Greece.
[00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:51.860]   You can even see this in reliefs and such.
[00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:55.580]   This is Greece before its time.
[00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:58.220]   This is prophetic with absolute precision,
[00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:00.140]   and that it had four wings on its back
[00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:02.980]   not only speak of its reach to the four corners
[00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:05.140]   of the earth, but its swiftness to do so
[00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:07.340]   as it was led by Alexander the Great,
[00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:09.900]   who at a very young age conquered the known world
[00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:11.900]   in rapid succession.
[00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:13.540]   And speaking of Alexander the Great,
[00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:14.460]   notice the next phrase.
[00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:16.200]   The beast also had four heads.
[00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:17.040]   Why four?
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:19.220]   Well, on the one hand, yes, it speaks again
[00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:21.540]   to the reach of Greece, but on the other hand,
[00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:23.280]   there were four generals that succeeded
[00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:24.380]   Alexander the Great.
[00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:27.820]   The prophetic precision here is astounding.
[00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:30.460]   Those four generals, Lysimachus, Cassander,
[00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:33.380]   Ptolemy, and Seleucus, how would you know
[00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:36.260]   about them ahead of time?
[00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:39.540]   It is a testimony to the inspiration of Scripture.
[00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:46.640]   And this beast, being so massive and so expansive,
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:49.940]   it still says in the text, though,
[00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:54.940]   look at the final phrase, and dominion was given to it.
[00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:58.540]   Notice the text does not say it gained dominion
[00:25:58.540 --> 00:25:59.900]   for itself.
[00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:02.860]   Dominion was given to it.
[00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:07.500]   And the question is, who gave it dominion?
[00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:09.900]   And the answer is God.
[00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:14.420]   Alexander the Great conquered a vast swath of territory,
[00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:16.340]   spanning the whole known world
[00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:19.340]   and even going as far as India.
[00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:21.100]   And we might be impressed with the breadth
[00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:23.220]   of people's accomplishments and the breadth
[00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:25.020]   of people's sovereignty and the breadth
[00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:26.980]   of people's domain and authority,
[00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:28.180]   but here's what we have to remember.
[00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:32.060]   And Alexander, he's just an illustration of this,
[00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:34.340]   that God's sovereignty controls the breadth
[00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:37.460]   of human ability, the breadth of human achievement,
[00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:38.780]   the breadth of human authority.
[00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:40.020]   That's all he is.
[00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:41.500]   That's all he is.
[00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:43.340]   And God not only controls the breadth
[00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:44.780]   of human ability and authority,
[00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:46.540]   he controls the height of it as well.
[00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:48.540]   And that's what we see in verses seven and eight.
[00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:51.940]   There's a fourth contender for who could be the final Adam.
[00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:53.740]   And in verses seven and eight we read,
[00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:55.580]   after this I kept looking in the night visions
[00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:57.140]   and behold, a fourth beast.
[00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:58.460]   There's the fourth contender.
[00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:02.900]   Fearsome, one who innately has terrifying might.
[00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:05.620]   And he is terrifying because he's so intimidating
[00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:08.540]   and he is extraordinarily strong.
[00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:10.700]   He is one who can actually exert
[00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:12.460]   all that force against others.
[00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:15.380]   This is a beast of a totally different caliber.
[00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:19.300]   And notice it says in verse seven, and it had iron teeth.
[00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:21.700]   This not only goes back to Daniel chapter two,
[00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:23.980]   which talks about the part of a statue,
[00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:25.620]   the image that had iron,
[00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:29.140]   but this explicitly refers to the nation of Rome.
[00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:32.580]   In fact, Rome was famed for having iron.
[00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:35.780]   They even had the Iron Legion.
[00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:38.940]   The Bible is so prophetic and so precise in its prophecy,
[00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:40.660]   it even knew the materials,
[00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:42.740]   the key materials a nation would use
[00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:45.300]   before the nation even existed.
[00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:47.380]   That's how precise it is.
[00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:50.100]   It's astounding to think about.
[00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:54.700]   And Rome, we know, did exactly what verse seven said it did.
[00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:58.860]   It says it devoured as it assimilated other nations
[00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:01.100]   and into itself and crushed
[00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:03.180]   to prevent any kind of resistance
[00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:06.820]   and then trampled them down in their own form of oppression
[00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:08.460]   the remainder with its feet.
[00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:12.180]   Rome did exactly that as it exerted total domination.
[00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:13.660]   And in that way, it was different
[00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:15.580]   from all the beasts that were before it.
[00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:18.020]   Rome had a much longer duration,
[00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:20.660]   much greater reach, and much greater influence,
[00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:24.180]   one that you could even argue extends through this very day
[00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:27.060]   and even into the Eschaton, speaking of which,
[00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:28.820]   notice the last phrase of verse seven,
[00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:31.300]   and it had 10 horns.
[00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:32.940]   So far, we have seen things
[00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:37.300]   that match with history very, very well, hand in glove.
[00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:42.300]   But all of a sudden, we read that this beast had 10 horns.
[00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:46.860]   Horns are a symbol of strength and a symbol of royalty.
[00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:48.740]   We can read that in the Psalms.
[00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:50.660]   That's a good place to look.
[00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:55.660]   And as such, normally, you have a king over a kingdom.
[00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:57.420]   But in this specific case,
[00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:02.420]   this kingdom becomes so large and so magnificent,
[00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:04.580]   it doesn't just have one king,
[00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:07.060]   it has the equivalent of 10 kings.
[00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:08.380]   You could think of it this way.
[00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:13.020]   This kingdom reaches a state where it is 10 times larger,
[00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:16.380]   10 times wealthier, 10 times more powerful,
[00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:20.980]   10 times more expansive than any other kingdom of this world.
[00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:22.300]   We have not seen that yet.
[00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:24.580]   And just like in Daniel 2,
[00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:27.980]   the 10 toes of the statue were part of a statue
[00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:31.940]   made with iron and clay, a new iteration,
[00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:34.860]   a new manifestation of the kingdom of Rome.
[00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:39.260]   You could say it's Rome 2.0, if you wanna say it that way.
[00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:43.180]   This is referring to the eschatological manifestation
[00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:44.220]   of Rome.
[00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:47.140]   This is referring to the culmination of Rome
[00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:49.240]   in the end times.
[00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:53.380]   It is 10 times a kingdom than any kingdom
[00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:55.300]   you have ever seen.
[00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:58.960]   It is the kingdom of the Antichrist.
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:02.260]   And in verse eight, while I was contemplating the horns,
[00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:04.260]   and Daniel has to think about this
[00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:06.540]   because he's not just focusing on kingdoms,
[00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:08.900]   he's focusing on who will be the final Adam,
[00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:11.820]   and there is a king coming out of this kingdom.
[00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:15.440]   As he's contemplating the horns, another horn,
[00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:19.380]   a little one, the underdog, came up among them,
[00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:22.260]   and three of the first horns were pulled up by the roots.
[00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:24.680]   This individual, this singular horn,
[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:28.140]   this new ruler, underdog on the block,
[00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:32.220]   totally upends and totally distorts and disturbs
[00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:34.980]   the power structure, the political system
[00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:39.260]   of this world in the end times.
[00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:42.420]   It has to be powerful to be able to do that.
[00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:46.660]   It has to be gargantuanly mighty to be able to do that,
[00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:47.980]   and you could think of it this way.
[00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:51.980]   This king, this king is the climax
[00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:53.940]   of the climax of the climax.
[00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:56.940]   Already, Rome itself, as a fourth kingdom,
[00:30:56.940 --> 00:31:00.020]   is a climactic kingdom, different than all the rest.
[00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:01.080]   That's the climax.
[00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:04.260]   But then it will have an eschatological manifestation
[00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:07.540]   with 10 horns, a 10-kingdom confederacy,
[00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:10.860]   and so that's the climactic climax of this kingdom,
[00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:13.380]   and now what you have is an antichrist
[00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:15.980]   who's the climax of those two climaxes.
[00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:20.220]   He's the climax of Rome and its eschatological manifestation,
[00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:22.940]   the climax of the climax of the climax,
[00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:26.820]   and as such, he possesses eyes, it says,
[00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:30.480]   at the end of verse eight, like the eyes of a man.
[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:33.060]   The antichrist will be the embodiment
[00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:36.780]   of all human intelligence, all human wisdom.
[00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:39.840]   He will be a genius like you've never seen before,
[00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:41.500]   a political genius.
[00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:44.300]   Just by way of illustration, in the book of Revelation,
[00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:45.860]   when we first meet the antichrist,
[00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:48.620]   he's riding on a white horse because he's a fake Christ,
[00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:51.940]   and he conquers the world, and it says he has a bow
[00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:54.200]   to conquer the world, but what's fascinating
[00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:55.820]   is there's no mention of arrows.
[00:31:55.820 --> 00:32:00.420]   How do you fight with a bow with no arrows?
[00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:03.220]   I don't know how to do that because I don't know Kung Fu,
[00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:09.720]   but the antichrist, he can conquer the world
[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:15.240]   without firing a shot because he's a genius.
[00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:19.160]   He's a genius like you've never seen before.
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:22.140]   He possesses eyes like the eyes of a man,
[00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:24.560]   and even more than that, notice this,
[00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:28.720]   he has a mouth that speaks great boasts.
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:32.320]   That word boasts, its underlying root word
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:35.300]   is the word great, and you say, why does that matter?
[00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:38.240]   Because the word great is used very strategically
[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:41.760]   in the book of Daniel, and it ultimately applies to
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:45.280]   and focuses on the statue, which was a what kind of statue
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:48.920]   in Daniel's vision, a great statue.
[00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:51.920]   The statue, the image in Daniel chapter two,
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:53.980]   not only represented different kingdoms,
[00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:57.520]   but collectively represented all of man's power,
[00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:00.640]   all of man's might, take all of history,
[00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:03.440]   all the nations, boil them all together,
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:06.520]   and assemble all of the authority and dominion of them,
[00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:08.880]   that is what the antichrist has.
[00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:10.920]   You could put it this way, he is the climax
[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:14.520]   of the climax of the climax, and he is the consolidation
[00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:18.920]   of all human intellect, wisdom, power, and might in one.
[00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:23.120]   This is the earth's final, final proposition,
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:27.000]   final proposal of who could be the final Adam,
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.400]   but there couldn't be more wrong.
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:32.260]   God has allowed all of this to happen.
[00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:34.640]   God has raised up all of this,
[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:37.320]   and there is a point to it all,
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:38.640]   and we can't miss that point.
[00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:41.060]   There are a lot of lessons that we can learn
[00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:43.140]   through this flow of history.
[00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:45.680]   We can learn lessons about God's sovereignty,
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:48.000]   that he has definitive sovereignty,
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.640]   whether you are man or beast is up to God.
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:52.040]   He has determinative sovereignty.
[00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:54.200]   How far you go is determined by God.
[00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:56.040]   How the breadth of man's authority
[00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:57.440]   or the height of man's authority,
[00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:00.880]   it's all determined by God, and those lessons would be true.
[00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:03.440]   There are important lessons in Daniel 7, 1 through 8
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:05.660]   about the nature of the word of God,
[00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:09.040]   that God can have just this prophetic accuracy,
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:11.240]   talking about kingdoms in succession
[00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:14.040]   and talking about them in such immaculate detail
[00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:15.640]   way before they happen.
[00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:18.220]   Put it this way, God can talk about what happens
[00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:20.240]   after Alexander the Great is dead
[00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:22.800]   before the guy is even born.
[00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:24.680]   That is how precise God is,
[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:27.680]   and what that testifies is there is a God in heaven,
[00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:29.200]   and he knows everything,
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:30.800]   and not only does he know everything,
[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:32.280]   he ordains everything,
[00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:34.040]   and not only does he ordain everything,
[00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:36.800]   he revealed it all right here.
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:39.040]   This text should be a cause for celebration
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:41.080]   because that is the nature of our God.
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:44.360]   And not only that, we not only learn lessons
[00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:46.240]   about God's sovereignty and the word of God,
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:48.860]   we learn lessons about eschatology.
[00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:51.360]   There are implications knowing that these four kingdoms come
[00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:54.240]   and an eschatological kingdom of the Antichrist will arise,
[00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:56.480]   and after that, Christ will return and set up his kingdom,
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:58.900]   just like we see in Daniel two and Daniel seven.
[00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:00.600]   There are implications of that,
[00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:03.000]   but brothers, don't miss the point.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.480]   Don't miss the point.
[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:07.800]   There is a reason why the imagery of this text
[00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:09.380]   is the way it is,
[00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:11.880]   because heaven has asked a question.
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:15.760]   Heaven has asked a question of all world history,
[00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:20.040]   and that question is who is the one who fulfills creation?
[00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:23.240]   Who is the one who is the destiny of this world?
[00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:25.900]   Who is the one who is the final Adam?
[00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:28.360]   That is the question of this world.
[00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:31.600]   That is the question of its history, and brothers,
[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:33.960]   if that is the case,
[00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:37.840]   then we better be careful of getting distracted
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:41.000]   and disillusioned by fads and trends
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.120]   instead of proclaiming the main question
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:46.960]   of who is the last Adam and who is that worthy?
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:47.940]   Let me put it this way.
[00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:51.560]   If that's God's question, that better be our question,
[00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:53.740]   because that's the main point.
[00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:57.600]   Even more, though, even more, don't miss this.
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:00.660]   God didn't just ask a question in this text
[00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:01.960]   with the imagery.
[00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:03.740]   God gave an answer.
[00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:08.000]   There is a reason why before Daniel's eyes in this vision,
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.560]   there is king after king and kingdom after kingdom
[00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:14.560]   after kingdom, because all of history is flowing,
[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:16.240]   and all of history is moving,
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:19.040]   and all of history is accelerating to the moment
[00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:22.080]   where heaven will give its answer.
[00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:24.420]   That's where history is going.
[00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:26.280]   The earth has made proposals.
[00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:29.120]   They've given us the top four mighty ones,
[00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:31.240]   and some of you here are wondering,
[00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:33.160]   where's the USA in this?
[00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:36.280]   U-S-A, U-S-A.
[00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:37.920]   (congregation laughing)
[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:40.980]   Brothers, we didn't even make it into the top four.
[00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:44.320]   (congregation laughing)
[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:51.080]   And that shows us the power that these men had in history
[00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:53.280]   we've never seen in our life.
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:55.780]   We've never seen in our life.
[00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:57.280]   But here's something else to know.
[00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:00.840]   Christ's power is still yet more.
[00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:03.960]   And along that line, history is moving,
[00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:07.200]   kingdom after kingdom, accelerating and flowing
[00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:10.180]   to the moment where earth offers its best solution,
[00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:12.040]   but that is no solution at all.
[00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:14.480]   And so earth will give way to heaven,
[00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:17.640]   and heaven will come down, and heaven will open up
[00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:20.960]   with all of its glory, and all of its brilliant light,
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:24.120]   and thunderous clarity, and will proclaim the answer,
[00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:26.400]   the answer that everyone has been looking for.
[00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:27.800]   Who is the final Adam?
[00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:29.480]   Who is the destiny of this world?
[00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:31.780]   Who is the one who fulfills Genesis one?
[00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:34.540]   It is the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:36.880]   There is a moment we are waiting for,
[00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:41.340]   and by God's design, all history waits for it.
[00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:43.160]   That is the truth of the matter.
[00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:46.660]   (congregation applauding)
[00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:50.880]   And brothers, since that is the case,
[00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:53.720]   then let us not keep our eyes fixed
[00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:55.360]   on the things of this world,
[00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:57.120]   and the things of the here and now.
[00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:00.400]   God is directing us to look to a future moment
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:02.440]   when heaven announces to earth,
[00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:05.920]   and heaven declares to earth, our eyes should turn there,
[00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:08.720]   and we should turn the eyes of our people there.
[00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:10.760]   There is a moment we are waiting for.
[00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:13.160]   All history is designed to wait for it,
[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:16.920]   and so we should await for it as well.
[00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:19.920]   Well, in light of that, let's get to the moment, shall we?
[00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:23.400]   And that's found in verses nine through 12.
[00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:26.080]   That is found in verses nine through 12.
[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:26.980]   And you could put it this way.
[00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:29.000]   The first reality we saw is that all history
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.640]   is waiting for this moment.
[00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:34.880]   The second reality is, anthropologically speaking,
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:38.420]   it is as if the Father is waiting for this moment.
[00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:41.640]   It is as if the Father is waiting for this moment.
[00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:44.400]   What is this moment like?
[00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:46.920]   I love the opening of this, verse nine.
[00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:51.040]   Daniel says, "I kept looking until thrones were set up."
[00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:52.920]   I love this.
[00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:55.080]   Whose thrones are those?
[00:38:55.080 --> 00:39:01.280]   And the Bible makes it clear, both by context,
[00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:04.520]   and even by later revelation, in confirmation,
[00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:07.480]   that these thrones are for the people of God.
[00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:10.920]   There are 24, 12 and 12, Israel and the church,
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:14.160]   for the elders of God and heaven,
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:17.440]   and for those who are all assembled around.
[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:20.000]   And this would be so encouraging to Daniel,
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.640]   because this is God's moment,
[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:23.160]   and God's message to Daniel.
[00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:25.840]   Daniel, I know you've been beaten up.
[00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:27.240]   I know you've been hunted.
[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:30.340]   I know you've been persecuted every single day
[00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:34.560]   since you were 10, for your whole life.
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:36.720]   Let me tell you this, Daniel.
[00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:39.100]   You will reign in the end.
[00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:44.280]   Brothers, we may be beaten down,
[00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:46.960]   and we may be those who are trampled,
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:49.840]   not even to the extent that Daniel was,
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:53.320]   but we need to remember this, truth triumphs.
[00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:54.560]   Truth triumphs.
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:57.960]   It is exactly Paul's promise,
[00:39:57.960 --> 00:40:02.280]   that if we endure with him, we will what?
[00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:03.560]   Reign.
[00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:04.880]   Truth triumphs.
[00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:06.560]   That's what we have here.
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:09.680]   But the moment isn't about us.
[00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:11.880]   This moment is not about us.
[00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:14.320]   It is about our God.
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:17.120]   And our God, like any celebration,
[00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:20.560]   any wedding or any festival or any milestone,
[00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:24.040]   every detail, every single detail,
[00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:27.800]   is carefully orchestrated and designed and crafted
[00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:32.000]   to accentuate the grandeur of this occasion.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:33.720]   And we can see that, for one,
[00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:37.940]   in everything about God is manifest to that end.
[00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:39.680]   And notice what the text says in verse nine,
[00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:42.800]   "And the Ancient of Days was seated."
[00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:44.920]   You say, Ancient of Days?
[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:46.740]   Is God old?
[00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:49.060]   No, he's eternal.
[00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:51.020]   He's eternal.
[00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:53.000]   He is above time.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.960]   He is beyond time.
[00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:58.120]   He transcends time.
[00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:02.560]   And only one who is so above and apart from time
[00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:05.360]   can define all time.
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:08.640]   Why does God appear here as the Ancient of Days?
[00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:10.240]   He is making a statement.
[00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:12.980]   From eternity past to eternity future,
[00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:15.460]   this is the moment.
[00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:18.080]   This is the moment that fulfills all time.
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:19.840]   This is the moment that fulfills all time.
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:23.600]   Notice what the text also describes about God in this text.
[00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:26.140]   His clothing was white like snow.
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:29.160]   We know that the priestly garments
[00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:30.440]   were supposed to be white.
[00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:32.540]   And we know that we were supposed to be cleansed
[00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:34.760]   white as snow, Isaiah chapter one.
[00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:36.540]   This is talking about holiness.
[00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:38.180]   This is talking about salvation.
[00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:41.120]   This is talking about redemption in that way.
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:43.400]   This is the moment that not only fulfills time,
[00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:46.000]   this is the moment that fulfills holiness and righteousness.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:47.880]   And not only that, notice what else the text says
[00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:48.720]   about our God.
[00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:51.800]   "And the hair of his head was like pure wool."
[00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:54.320]   The scriptures describe those who have white hair
[00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:57.680]   and who have gray hair as those of immense wisdom.
[00:41:57.680 --> 00:41:59.320]   We can see this in Proverbs.
[00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:02.080]   "And though the wisdom of our God has been hidden
[00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:04.560]   "throughout the ages, and the wisdom of the cross
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:06.460]   "is hidden to those who are perishing,
[00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:08.440]   "there will be a day when the wisdom of God
[00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:11.360]   "is made abundantly clear, and every knee will bow,
[00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:14.000]   "and every mouth will be shut because they see
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.520]   "the brilliance of our God."
[00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:17.040]   This is that moment.
[00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:18.160]   This is that moment.
[00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:21.180]   And so everything about God is presented
[00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:25.080]   and manifested to show this will be the display
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:29.360]   of the sovereign God in all time, in all wisdom,
[00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:31.800]   in all righteousness.
[00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:34.000]   But it's not just everything about God.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.700]   It's everything around God.
[00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:37.120]   Notice what the text says.
[00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:39.700]   "His throne," next part of verse nine,
[00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:43.320]   "was ablaze with fire, the epicenter of his authority,
[00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:45.460]   "the epicenter of his omnipotence,
[00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:50.280]   "the epicenter of his power, was focused on one thing,
[00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:54.960]   "ablaze with fire, the fire of destructive judgment."
[00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:58.240]   This will be the fulfillment of justice and judgment.
[00:42:58.240 --> 00:42:59.600]   And it won't just be the fulfillment
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:00.760]   of justice and judgment.
[00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:03.560]   It'll be the fulfillment of the world in that regard
[00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:05.460]   because notice the last phrase of verse nine,
[00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:08.720]   "Its wheels were a burning fire."
[00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:12.080]   It is very important that we remember
[00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:15.640]   that this chariot throne is a chariot throne.
[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:17.480]   It'll come in view later.
[00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:19.760]   Ezekiel sees the same thing.
[00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:22.720]   He sees a throne with wheels within a wheel,
[00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:24.520]   symbolizing and demonstrating
[00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:27.640]   that not only is our God omnipotent, he's omnipresent.
[00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:31.600]   He can go anywhere at any time and strike anything.
[00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:34.720]   And with that, this blazing, fiery throne
[00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:38.880]   is going to judge every inch of this world.
[00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:41.120]   And that judgment will be final.
[00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:42.280]   Notice verse 10.
[00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:46.180]   "A river of fire was flowing and coming out from him."
[00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:49.680]   It is like there will be a deluge of fire
[00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:52.100]   that will consume the world.
[00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:55.120]   God flooded the world the first time
[00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:58.560]   and he promised never to do that again with water,
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:02.160]   but he never said anything about not doing it with fire.
[00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:06.880]   And the first judgment anticipates this final one.
[00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:09.500]   The first judgment was a warning.
[00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:12.000]   Water is God going easy.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.440]   Fire is God going final.
[00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:20.080]   And God says, "I will destroy, I will judge
[00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:25.080]   "this entire world in a final judgment."
[00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:27.080]   He's going to do it with fire.
[00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:29.400]   That's why I'm green, 'cause I just wanna make sure
[00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:32.080]   there's plenty of kindling for the occasion.
[00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:35.600]   Just kidding.
[00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:42.560]   And so what you have is this is a moment that defines time.
[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:44.380]   This is a moment that defines holiness.
[00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:46.080]   This is a moment that defines wisdom.
[00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:47.720]   This is a moment that fulfills judgment.
[00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:51.640]   And this is a moment that fulfills Earth and its history.
[00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:53.840]   Everything about God and everything around God
[00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:54.800]   is poised for this moment,
[00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:56.840]   but it's not just everything about or around God.
[00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:58.160]   It's everything alongside of God.
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:00.320]   Notice the last part of verse 10.
[00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:03.000]   "Thousands upon thousands were attending him."
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.400]   This moment doesn't just fulfill Earth.
[00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:07.900]   This moment fulfills heaven.
[00:45:07.900 --> 00:45:11.040]   It fulfills heaven as thousands upon thousands
[00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:15.060]   are standing at attention, ready to do God's bidding.
[00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:19.460]   Have you ever wondered what the phrase Yahweh of hosts means?
[00:45:19.460 --> 00:45:21.140]   Yahweh of the armies.
[00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:22.800]   Here you learn the lesson.
[00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:24.700]   He commands the armies of heaven,
[00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:27.400]   and the armies of heaven now are all assembled
[00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:28.980]   to execute his will.
[00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:31.980]   It is infallible, and it is also majestic,
[00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:36.980]   as myriads upon myriads were standing before him in salute.
[00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:40.420]   People, kings of old, gathered their courts together
[00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:43.460]   as a display of their power and their majesty
[00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:45.580]   and their glory, but those courtiers,
[00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:49.100]   they might be just 10 or 100, maybe 300.
[00:45:49.100 --> 00:45:51.780]   Here you have, before God, all of heaven assembled,
[00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:54.380]   10,000 upon 10,000 upon 10,000,
[00:45:54.380 --> 00:45:57.540]   finally living out the destiny for which they were created.
[00:45:57.540 --> 00:45:59.400]   It is for this moment.
[00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:01.980]   This moment fulfills Earth, even as it fulfills.
[00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:04.140]   (silence)
[00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:06.300]   (silence)
[00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:08.460]   (silence)
[00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:10.620]   (silence)
[00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:12.780]   (silence)
[00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:14.940]   (silence)
[00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:17.100]   (silence)
[00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:43.980]   The very reason, in God's providence,
[00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:47.660]   that he ordained Daniel's name to be Daniel
[00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:51.100]   is to point to this moment.
[00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:53.900]   This is the moment that not only fulfills time
[00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:56.380]   and holiness and wisdom and judgment
[00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:58.440]   and Earth and all heaven,
[00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:02.100]   this is the moment that fulfills all revelation.
[00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:04.720]   And when you have that kind of moment
[00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:08.100]   that deals with time and holiness and wisdom
[00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:10.700]   and judgment, Earth and heaven and revelation,
[00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:14.220]   and everything around God and everything about God
[00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:19.020]   and everything alongside of God so craftily designed,
[00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:22.020]   then you know that that is the moment we are waiting for.
[00:47:22.020 --> 00:47:25.220]   And you know even more, anthropomorphically speaking,
[00:47:25.220 --> 00:47:28.340]   that is the moment the Father is waiting for.
[00:47:28.340 --> 00:47:31.100]   And this moment, this moment isn't just for show,
[00:47:31.100 --> 00:47:31.920]   it's effective.
[00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:34.060]   Notice verses 11 and 12.
[00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:36.420]   Here's what happens from heaven to Earth.
[00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:38.020]   Then I kept looking because of the sound
[00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:40.580]   of the great boastful words which the horn was speaking.
[00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:44.020]   The horn is at its pinnacle of greatness,
[00:47:44.020 --> 00:47:46.940]   assuming all the strength and all that embodies
[00:47:46.940 --> 00:47:51.940]   all the world nations of all history in and of himself.
[00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:54.980]   And in this pinnacle moment, what does it say?
[00:47:54.980 --> 00:47:56.900]   I kept looking until the beast was killed.
[00:47:56.900 --> 00:47:58.300]   He's defeated.
[00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:02.020]   This embodiment of evil, this embodiment of human might,
[00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:05.600]   this embodiment of human ingenuity is defeated.
[00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:06.860]   But it's not just that he's defeated.
[00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:09.540]   Notice, its body was destroyed.
[00:48:09.540 --> 00:48:13.460]   His entire kingdom, the entire system that he has set up,
[00:48:13.460 --> 00:48:16.620]   the most elaborate system celebrating man
[00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:20.500]   and celebrating earthly achievement, it is dismantled.
[00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:22.540]   Evil is dismantled in that way.
[00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:24.180]   But it's not just that there was defeat.
[00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:25.980]   It's not just that there was dismantling.
[00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:27.420]   There is damnation.
[00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:28.820]   Notice the last phrase.
[00:48:28.820 --> 00:48:32.980]   And given to the burning fire.
[00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:35.660]   Do you know what God does with evil in the end?
[00:48:35.660 --> 00:48:38.340]   He doesn't just defeat it.
[00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:43.340]   What he does is it is subjugated to eternal condemnation,
[00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:47.220]   eternal punishment, so that that evil,
[00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:51.340]   in its eternal punishment, will give glory to God
[00:48:51.340 --> 00:48:53.860]   and his righteousness forever.
[00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:57.960]   That is when really truth triumphs.
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:02.300]   And the extent of this is made clear, verse 12.
[00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:05.100]   As for the rest of the beast, their dominion was taken away
[00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:06.900]   but an extension of life was given to them
[00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:08.660]   for an appointed season of time.
[00:49:08.660 --> 00:49:11.900]   On the one hand, these beasts pop up again.
[00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:13.260]   These other nations pop up.
[00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:16.560]   It's as if the fourth kingdom never even existed.
[00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:18.180]   It is so eradicated.
[00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:19.620]   It is so erased.
[00:49:19.620 --> 00:49:22.740]   It is so dealt with that it is gone.
[00:49:22.740 --> 00:49:24.860]   And all you have are the other beasts.
[00:49:24.860 --> 00:49:26.700]   But on the other hand, here's the question.
[00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:29.980]   Why was it, verse 12, that these beasts,
[00:49:29.980 --> 00:49:33.660]   their dominion was taken away?
[00:49:33.660 --> 00:49:36.500]   Because in this moment, this moment that deals with time
[00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:38.540]   and holiness and wisdom, heaven and earth
[00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:40.340]   and judgment and all revelation,
[00:49:40.340 --> 00:49:45.100]   this moment was designed so that it would strip everyone
[00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:48.980]   of any semblance of power, any semblance of rule,
[00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:52.500]   any semblance of might, any semblance of authority,
[00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:55.540]   so that there would be one and only one
[00:49:55.540 --> 00:49:59.060]   who possesses all of that by himself,
[00:49:59.060 --> 00:50:02.460]   and that is the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:50:02.460 --> 00:50:04.860]   Why is this the moment, in a sense,
[00:50:04.860 --> 00:50:06.300]   that the Father is waiting for?
[00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:09.460]   Because this is for his Son.
[00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:14.460]   This is when he gives his Son all that his Son deserves.
[00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:18.700]   This is the moment that truth triumphs.
[00:50:18.700 --> 00:50:21.120]   Everything in this moment is meant
[00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:23.280]   so that everything in this world
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:24.940]   will not only be made right,
[00:50:24.940 --> 00:50:26.640]   but not only be reconfigured,
[00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:29.300]   but will revolve around God's Son.
[00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:32.900]   And at that moment, when this takes place,
[00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:36.460]   it will be true that thy kingdom come
[00:50:36.460 --> 00:50:41.460]   and thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[00:50:41.460 --> 00:50:44.580]   That's when truth triumphs.
[00:50:44.580 --> 00:50:47.780]   And brothers, brothers then,
[00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:51.420]   when you are discouraged and when you face trial,
[00:50:51.420 --> 00:50:53.700]   and there are times in our heart we wonder,
[00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:55.020]   is this worth it?
[00:50:55.020 --> 00:50:56.580]   Should I just keep going?
[00:50:56.580 --> 00:51:00.260]   Or should I throw in the towel and call it quits?
[00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:01.500]   Well, we must remind ourselves
[00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:03.600]   this is not the way it ends.
[00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:05.220]   This is not the way it ends.
[00:51:05.220 --> 00:51:07.740]   There is a moment we are waiting for,
[00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:09.980]   a moment when the world is made right
[00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:13.260]   and it is reconfigured around the Son of God.
[00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:15.660]   And at that moment, everything we've labored for
[00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:17.020]   and everything we've preached
[00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:18.500]   will not only come to pass,
[00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:19.500]   it will be vindicated.
[00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:20.860]   And it won't just be vindicated,
[00:51:20.860 --> 00:51:22.540]   but in the mercy of God,
[00:51:22.540 --> 00:51:27.380]   he will use it to honor the Son that he loves.
[00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:30.640]   And at that moment, we will know,
[00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:34.300]   we will know it is absolutely worth it
[00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:37.780]   because he has always been worth it.
[00:51:37.780 --> 00:51:40.580]   There is a moment we are waiting for.
[00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:42.120]   Hang in there, brothers.
[00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:43.900]   There is a moment that we are waiting for
[00:51:43.900 --> 00:51:45.400]   and it will be worthwhile
[00:51:45.400 --> 00:51:49.460]   because God has ordained it for his Son.
[00:51:49.460 --> 00:51:52.640]   And so we've seen this is the moment
[00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:54.300]   that history waits for.
[00:51:54.300 --> 00:51:59.180]   This is the moment that the Father, in a sense, waits for.
[00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:01.100]   Because it's about his Son.
[00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:03.600]   And that leads us to the final point.
[00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:06.760]   Then this is the moment for Christ.
[00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:08.740]   This is the moment for Christ.
[00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:12.100]   And we see that in verses 13 and 14.
[00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:16.520]   Daniel says, "I kept looking in the night visions."
[00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:18.700]   He's seen all the fakes.
[00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:20.300]   He's seen all the frauds.
[00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:23.680]   Now he wants to see the real one.
[00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:28.520]   And what makes this one so real?
[00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:31.420]   Well, for one, he's Lord of heaven.
[00:52:31.420 --> 00:52:34.200]   And behold, with the clouds of heaven.
[00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:37.520]   Behold, with the clouds of heaven.
[00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:40.640]   Christ is riding the clouds of heaven.
[00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:41.480]   Why?
[00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:45.000]   Because it testifies of his swiftness, his speed.
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:46.640]   It's amazing to think about.
[00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:48.320]   Lightning fast.
[00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:49.200]   But it's not just that.
[00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:52.080]   Clouds are used in Psalm 97 and elsewhere
[00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:55.040]   to speak of the mystery of God.
[00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:57.720]   Christ has an impenetrable holiness,
[00:52:57.720 --> 00:53:01.760]   an impenetrable glory, an impenetrable greatness.
[00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:03.680]   And he is manifest with that.
[00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:06.720]   But even more than swiftness, even more than supremacy,
[00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:08.480]   here is the truth of the matter.
[00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:11.120]   Christ rides in with all of heaven behind him.
[00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:15.800]   There is only one who rallies heaven.
[00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:18.720]   There is only one who all of heaven
[00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:21.480]   will assemble around in the end.
[00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:24.040]   And it is the one in this vision.
[00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:25.760]   He's not just the Lord of heaven.
[00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:26.880]   He's the Lord of earth.
[00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:27.740]   Notice the next phrase.
[00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:31.120]   One like a son of man was coming.
[00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:33.760]   It is crucial that you see the word like
[00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:36.560]   because that shows similarity and dissimilarity.
[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:40.360]   Christ is a son of man because he's truly man.
[00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:43.360]   But he is not just a man, he is God-man.
[00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:46.720]   And even more, he is God-man who fulfills
[00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:49.360]   the role of the final Adam.
[00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:52.400]   He does not have the finiteness or the frailty
[00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:55.840]   and certainly not the sin of any normal man.
[00:53:55.840 --> 00:53:59.720]   He is the one who surpasses and transcends all of this
[00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:02.640]   because he is God-man and therefore has the right
[00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:04.960]   and the capability to be the last Adam,
[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:06.600]   the destiny of this world.
[00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:09.400]   There is only one who can be the final Adam
[00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:11.280]   and it is the one of this vision.
[00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:14.040]   He is not just the Lord of heaven or the Lord of earth.
[00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:15.520]   He's also exalted.
[00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:16.880]   Notice what it says.
[00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:18.400]   And he, that is the son of man,
[00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:19.960]   came up to the ancient of days.
[00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:23.560]   The word came up to has the idea in Aramaic
[00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:25.000]   of the word reached.
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:27.160]   It is a similar word used in Genesis
[00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:30.640]   that the tower of Babel attempted to reach heaven.
[00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:34.060]   And in Daniel chapter two, the statue of man
[00:54:34.060 --> 00:54:35.920]   attempted to reach the skies.
[00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:38.040]   And in Daniel chapter four, Nebuchadnezzar
[00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:40.400]   thought he could reach heaven.
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:42.440]   None of them can, none of them can.
[00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:43.280]   Why?
[00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:44.880]   Because there is only one who can.
[00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:46.400]   There is only one whose accomplishments
[00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:47.460]   will ascend on high.
[00:54:47.460 --> 00:54:50.140]   There is only one whose achievements are so exalted.
[00:54:50.140 --> 00:54:52.480]   It is the one of this vision.
[00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:55.440]   And he not only came before the ancient of days,
[00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:58.360]   he came near before him because he's not just exalted.
[00:54:58.360 --> 00:55:00.040]   He's equal to God.
[00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:02.260]   If any of us came face to face with God,
[00:55:02.260 --> 00:55:04.200]   we know exactly what would happen.
[00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:05.600]   We fall like a dead man.
[00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:08.120]   Not this one.
[00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:10.640]   Because there's only one who is equal
[00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:12.100]   to the father is God man.
[00:55:12.100 --> 00:55:15.240]   It is the one in this vision.
[00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:16.880]   And this one is not just the Lord of heaven.
[00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:18.160]   He's not just the Lord of earth.
[00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:19.360]   He's not just exalted.
[00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:20.400]   He's not just equal.
[00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:21.740]   He has all victory.
[00:55:21.740 --> 00:55:22.920]   Notice verse 14.
[00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:27.120]   And to him was given dominion, glory, and a kingdom.
[00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:30.320]   Dominion refers to the rule of power that one may have.
[00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:32.840]   Glory refers to the honor that one receives.
[00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:35.760]   And a kingdom shows where all that places out
[00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:37.860]   and all of that takes place.
[00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:42.760]   The kings in Daniel, even Daniel seven,
[00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:45.920]   but even earlier than that, they all want dominion.
[00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:47.320]   They all want glory.
[00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:49.080]   They all want a kingdom.
[00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:51.680]   They all seek to have it desperately,
[00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:52.540]   but they never can.
[00:55:52.540 --> 00:55:53.380]   Why?
[00:55:53.380 --> 00:55:57.640]   Because there is only one and one only who deserves it.
[00:55:57.640 --> 00:56:00.240]   And it is the one of this vision.
[00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:02.020]   He doesn't just have the all victory.
[00:56:02.020 --> 00:56:02.860]   He has all people.
[00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:04.440]   Notice the next phrase of verse 14.
[00:56:04.440 --> 00:56:08.140]   That all the people, nations, and men of every tongue.
[00:56:08.140 --> 00:56:10.560]   That phrase is used throughout Daniel.
[00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:12.640]   Daniel three, that's what Nebuchadnezzar
[00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:14.520]   wanted everybody to worship him.
[00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:16.200]   In Daniel four, that's what Nebuchadnezzar
[00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:18.660]   addressed to show his might.
[00:56:18.660 --> 00:56:21.940]   And in Daniel five, a similar idea takes place.
[00:56:21.940 --> 00:56:24.180]   And even in Daniel six, the phrase is used
[00:56:24.180 --> 00:56:26.420]   to show Cyrus's own power.
[00:56:26.420 --> 00:56:28.740]   And they all thought that they could compel
[00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:31.220]   and control people, nation, and every man
[00:56:31.220 --> 00:56:34.620]   of every tribe and tongue, but they couldn't.
[00:56:34.620 --> 00:56:35.460]   They couldn't.
[00:56:35.460 --> 00:56:36.280]   Why?
[00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:40.220]   Because that right is reserved for one and only one.
[00:56:40.220 --> 00:56:41.420]   The one in this vision.
[00:56:41.420 --> 00:56:43.620]   And it's not just that there's all victory to this one
[00:56:43.620 --> 00:56:44.820]   and all people to this one.
[00:56:44.820 --> 00:56:47.380]   It is that all worship goes to this one.
[00:56:47.380 --> 00:56:48.500]   Notice the next phrase.
[00:56:48.500 --> 00:56:51.020]   That those people might serve him.
[00:56:51.020 --> 00:56:54.060]   Nebuchadnezzar ordered that everyone in his kingdom
[00:56:54.060 --> 00:56:58.360]   serve him by bowing to the statue, but three refused.
[00:56:58.360 --> 00:56:59.200]   Three refused.
[00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:00.020]   Why?
[00:57:00.020 --> 00:57:03.140]   To show you will never have all the worship
[00:57:03.140 --> 00:57:04.140]   of all the peoples.
[00:57:04.140 --> 00:57:04.980]   Why?
[00:57:04.980 --> 00:57:08.940]   Because that belongs to one and only one.
[00:57:08.940 --> 00:57:11.660]   The one in this vision.
[00:57:11.660 --> 00:57:13.500]   This one is not only the Lord of heaven,
[00:57:13.500 --> 00:57:15.000]   the Lord of earth, exalted and equal,
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:17.300]   all victory, all people, all worship belonging to him,
[00:57:17.300 --> 00:57:18.300]   but he has it forever.
[00:57:18.300 --> 00:57:19.740]   He is king forever.
[00:57:19.740 --> 00:57:22.520]   Notice his dominion is an everlasting dominion
[00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:25.260]   which will not be taken away unlike all the other kings.
[00:57:25.260 --> 00:57:27.380]   And furthermore, his kingdom is one
[00:57:27.380 --> 00:57:29.400]   which will not be destroyed.
[00:57:29.400 --> 00:57:32.640]   Every other king, his kingdom just goes
[00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:35.260]   into the history books to be forgotten
[00:57:35.260 --> 00:57:37.940]   unless a history teacher brings it up to you
[00:57:37.940 --> 00:57:39.520]   and examines you on it.
[00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:43.860]   But with Christ, we will never have just memories
[00:57:43.860 --> 00:57:44.860]   of his kingdom.
[00:57:44.860 --> 00:57:48.660]   It will be the everlasting in your face reality
[00:57:48.660 --> 00:57:50.900]   that celebrates him for forever
[00:57:50.900 --> 00:57:55.180]   because his kingdom endures over all and forever.
[00:57:55.180 --> 00:57:57.860]   This is what this vision reveals.
[00:57:57.860 --> 00:58:00.180]   And when you are the Lord of heaven
[00:58:00.180 --> 00:58:02.980]   and the Lord of earth, exalted and equal,
[00:58:02.980 --> 00:58:05.900]   having all victory, all people, all worship,
[00:58:05.900 --> 00:58:08.720]   you are a king forever and your kingdom is forever.
[00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:11.160]   When you are the one who is all in all
[00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:14.580]   and everything and everywhere and every way
[00:58:14.580 --> 00:58:19.580]   and eternally, then you are the only one who is worthy.
[00:58:19.580 --> 00:58:21.000]   That's the truth of it.
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:24.680]   And what has happened is heaven has posed a question
[00:58:24.680 --> 00:58:27.440]   to earth, who is the one who has been worthy?
[00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:29.440]   Who is the one who is the final Adam?
[00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:31.800]   And all of earth history has been on a search
[00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:33.840]   for this individual, but in the end,
[00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:36.800]   heaven will declare to earth that there is only one.
[00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:38.920]   There is only one who is Lord of heaven.
[00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:40.920]   There is only one who is Lord of earth.
[00:58:40.920 --> 00:58:43.160]   There is only one who is exalted.
[00:58:43.160 --> 00:58:45.160]   There is only one who is equal to God.
[00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:47.040]   There is only one who has all victory,
[00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:49.680]   all peoples, all worship, who is king forever
[00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:51.120]   and his kingdom is forever.
[00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:55.780]   And that one is the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:58:55.780 --> 00:58:58.280]   There is a moment we are waiting for.
[00:58:58.280 --> 00:59:02.240]   And we love that moment because it is all about Christ
[00:59:02.240 --> 00:59:05.480]   and we love him.
[00:59:05.480 --> 00:59:08.520]   That's why that moment matters so much to us.
[00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:10.560]   And brothers, in light of that,
[00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:15.440]   there is always a temptation in ministry to promote ourselves.
[00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:17.960]   That we feel like we're the guru,
[00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:19.600]   we're the center of everything.
[00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:23.920]   People have to come to us because we're just that central.
[00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:28.640]   And we want to believe that the world hangs on our shoulders.
[00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:31.160]   Brothers, there's a moment that we're waiting for.
[00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:34.560]   And in that moment, none of us matter.
[00:59:34.560 --> 00:59:36.960]   Who matters and who is on display
[00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:39.960]   is the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:42.880]   And we love that moment because of him.
[00:59:42.880 --> 00:59:45.360]   And therefore, we proclaim him.
[00:59:45.360 --> 00:59:47.360]   Truth triumphs, brothers, that's true.
[00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:49.080]   Truth triumphs, that's true.
[00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:52.240]   But truth triumphs in him alone.
[00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:53.720]   So we preach Christ.
[00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:57.680]   There's a moment that we are waiting for.
[00:59:57.680 --> 00:59:59.640]   It's a moment that history waits for.
[00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:01.720]   It's a moment, in a sense, that God waits for.
[01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:03.900]   It's a moment that's all about Christ.
[01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:06.400]   But here's something by way of epilogue to think about.
[01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:08.280]   Daniel wasn't the only one waiting for this moment.
[01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:10.920]   Think about with me the book of Isaiah, chapter six.
[01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:12.160]   What does Isaiah say?
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:16.320]   I saw the Lord seated on a throne high and lifted up,
[01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:17.280]   just like Daniel seven.
[01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:20.960]   Isaiah saw an aspect of the same vision.
[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:22.000]   Think about Ezekiel.
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.560]   He saw a chariot thrown,
[01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:28.560]   a throne having wheels within a wheel, just like Daniel.
[01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:29.400]   Why?
[01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:32.280]   Because Ezekiel saw elements of the same vision.
[01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:35.560]   Paul, on the Damascus road, he saw the glorified Christ.
[01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:37.640]   And in that moment, the circumstances matched
[01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:39.320]   with Daniel seven, and even the discussion
[01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:42.460]   of the saints that Paul has on the Damascus road,
[01:00:42.460 --> 01:00:44.360]   it matches what happens in Daniel seven.
[01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:47.760]   Paul, on the Damascus road, saw elements of the same vision.
[01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:51.200]   And of course, John, in Revelation chapter four and five.
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:52.340]   What does he see?
[01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:55.960]   The Lamb of God taking the scroll from the Ancient of Days.
[01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:58.360]   They saw the same thing.
[01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:01.160]   Daniel wasn't the only one waiting for this vision.
[01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:02.360]   It was Isaiah.
[01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:04.080]   It was Ezekiel.
[01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:05.200]   It was Paul.
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:06.400]   It was John.
[01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:08.600]   It's all of the people of God.
[01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:12.520]   We are all waiting for this moment.
[01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:14.040]   And in light of that, brothers,
[01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:16.000]   if you ever get disillusioned,
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.600]   if you ever just are stuck in the here and now,
[01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:20.680]   and you can't get your mind off of that,
[01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:23.260]   remember, there is a moment we are waiting for.
[01:01:23.260 --> 01:01:26.040]   It is going to the future, not to the here and now.
[01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:28.040]   And brothers, if you are discouraged,
[01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:30.080]   and you are desperate, and you are wondering,
[01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:30.900]   is it worth it?
[01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:33.480]   There is a moment we are waiting for.
[01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:35.600]   It is a moment that is absolutely worthwhile,
[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:37.560]   for it is for God's Son.
[01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:39.960]   And if there are times when you are distracted,
[01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:42.480]   and you are thinking more about yourself than Christ,
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:45.760]   remember, there is a moment that we are waiting for,
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:49.120]   and it reveals that there is only one who is worthy.
[01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:51.920]   There is a moment that we are waiting for.
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:54.240]   That is where we fix our eyes upon.
[01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:56.280]   That is the secret of perseverance.
[01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:57.680]   Truth triumphs.
[01:01:57.680 --> 01:01:59.280]   And Daniel knew that,
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:01.240]   because that's the center of the book,
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:03.280]   because it's the center of his own soul,
[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:05.400]   and it kept him to the end.
[01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:07.160]   So may it be, brothers,
[01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:09.160]   may it be that we persevere,
[01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:10.720]   and we hang in there well,
[01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:13.360]   and we endure faithfully to the end,
[01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:15.640]   because there is a moment we are waiting for.
[01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:20.240]   And brothers, it will surely come soon.
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:21.960]   Shall we pray?
[01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:23.840]   Our God and Father,
[01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:27.200]   thank you for this revelation of your promise,
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:29.260]   and this revelation of your prophecy.
[01:02:29.260 --> 01:02:33.120]   Help us to lift our eyes from earth to heaven,
[01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:35.240]   to think of from the things of this world
[01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:38.360]   to the things above, where Christ is,
[01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:39.920]   and to see him and to know
[01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:41.600]   that he will be so exalted in the end,
[01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:45.680]   and in the end, it will be thy kingdom come,
[01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:49.300]   thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:51.160]   Help us to long for that,
[01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:53.880]   and through that, to endure to that end,
[01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:56.840]   and to proclaim the Christ of that moment,
[01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:59.580]   who is eternally worthy.
[01:02:59.580 --> 01:03:02.680]   Be glorified in our lives,
[01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:07.680]   and we delight that you are always so triumphant.
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:09.960]   In your name we pray, amen.
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:12.740]   (feet tapping)
[01:03:12.740 --> 01:03:14.900]   (silence)
[01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:16.960]   you
