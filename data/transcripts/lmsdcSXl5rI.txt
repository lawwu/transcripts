[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   This week we welcome to the Ask Pastor John podcast, Dr. Russell Moore, a good friend of ours,
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   who serves as the 8th president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   There are so many questions related to the church and culture in our inbox,
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   and Dr. Moore will help us out this week on the podcast, filling in for John Piper.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   And I want to begin the week by asking you, Dr. Moore, about that very thing we call religious liberty.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   In 1 Timothy 2, we see that religious liberty is a very good thing for the church.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   Obviously, it's a good thing.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   But you believe religious liberty is at root not merely a political freedom, but a divine right to be defended.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   According to the Christian worldview, what are some transcendent principles behind religious liberty?
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   Yeah, Tony, one of the problems that I think many Christians have is that we don't know who the villain is
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   when we start thinking about issues of religious liberty.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   I think there are a lot of Christians today who would say, "Let's just shrug off religious liberty concerns,"
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   because they assume that they're in the place of Jesus and the government's in the place of Pilate,
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   and so let's just do what Jesus did and not speak in our own defense
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   and let the government impose whatever sorts of restrictions it wants to impose.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Now, on the one hand, there's a good impulse behind that,
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   and that impulse is that the gospel goes forward,
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   regardless of what any government or any king or any dictator attempts to do.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   There's no stopping the advance of the church because Jesus promised this at Caesarea Philippi,
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   and Jesus keeps his promise that he's going to build his church.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   There's also a good impulse in the sense that the writer of Hebrews says
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   we ought to be ready to be joyful even in the plundering of our property.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   And so there are good impulses there, but I think that that is wrongheaded,
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   and here's why it's wrongheaded.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   The Bible says that God holds Caesar, holds governments accountable
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   for the wielding of the sword in Romans chapter 13.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   And so when we live in a democratic republic, the people ultimately are Caesar,
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   that the people ultimately have accountability.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   And so the question is not simply are we going to be persecuted,
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   although that's an important question, it's also are we going to be persecutors?
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Because if the government in our context is restricting people's religious freedom,
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   we are restricting people's religious freedom.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   And there are a number of theological and biblical principles that come into play.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   The first is a matter of lordship.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   The Bible says that God has given the sword to Caesar to be used in a very specific context
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   to punish evildoers and to encourage the good.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   But the Bible makes very clear also that there are limits upon that power.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   That's why in Revelation 13 we see a government that is a beast state,
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   a government that has overstepped its bounds.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   So there's a matter of lordship here.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Is the government over the conscience in order to direct worship
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   and to direct the practice that comes out of that worship?
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   That's what Peter and John were encountering when they said,
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   "We are going to render unto Caesar that which belongs to Caesar,
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   but we're not going to render our consciences up when it comes to being forced,
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   for instance, not to proclaim the name of Jesus."
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   This is also a matter of gospel because what happens is the gospel cannot be enforced by the government.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   You can't at the point of a sword have people become Christians
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   because it's not the way the Spirit works.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   Nor can you restrict the advance of the gospel by the power of the government.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   How does the gospel go forward?
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   It goes forward, the Apostle Paul says, by openly appealing,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   not by peddling the Word of God, but by openly appealing to the conscience.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   So the government doesn't have the right to coerce
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   and the government doesn't have the right to restrict the worship that comes from the heart.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   It's also a matter of the kingdom, our understanding of the kingdom of God.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   The Scripture tells us that Jesus has been given head over all things,
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   over His body, which is the church, Ephesians 1.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   And that church is to advance, the Scripture says, according to spiritual means.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   So there's a lot of confusion that happens these days about, for instance,
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   the phrase "separation of church and state"
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   because people have used separation of church and state to mean a separation
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   of any religious motivation or conviction from the public square.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   That's not what the separation of church and state means.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   It ultimately is something very biblical, which is to say the state has a responsibility
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   held accountable before God to that responsibility,
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   but the church also has a responsibility and a mission,
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   and that mission is to be advanced with spiritual means.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   And what that means, though, is that we have responsibilities as churches
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   and we have responsibilities as citizens.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   The Apostle Paul appealed for his freedom.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   He appealed to his Roman citizenship for his liberty
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   because the Apostle Paul knew this isn't simply about his rights.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   He's willing in all sorts of other places to surrender his rights.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   He is appealing for those things because he does not believe that the courts
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   are over his conscience when it comes to worship,
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   and because he believes that this has implications for the advance of the gospel
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   for other people.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   So I think what we need to be advocating for is the sort of pluralism in the public square
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   that doesn't cause there to be less conversation, that causes there to be more conversation
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   so that we are appealing to Muslims and to Hindus and to secularists
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   about why we believe that the gospel is true,
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   why we believe that Jesus has been raised from the dead.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   We don't expect the government to do that for us,
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   and we don't expect a government that's big enough to restrict us from doing that.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   And at the same time, we listen to those voices on the outside,
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   and our ultimate hope is not that they would be silenced by the state.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   We don't want that.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   We want instead to persuade people through the power of the sword of the Spirit,
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   which is the Word of God, that comes only to free consciences.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   We want liberty and Jesus for all.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   Thank you, Dr. Moore. I appreciate your thoughts on religious liberty.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   And Dr. Moore serves as the 8th president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   of the Southern Baptist Convention,
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   and he will be joining us all week to address this and other questions related to the church and culture.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   He is an author, blogger, podcast, and you'll see him appear from time to time on televised news programs,
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   and you can keep up with him or try to keep up with him at russellmoore.com or on Twitter @DrMoore.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   Speaking of Twitter, when our Twitter feed lights up with news of an evangelical leader
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   who has chosen to come out and endorse same-sex marriage, what are we to do?
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   I'll ask Dr. Moore tomorrow.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   I'm your host, Tony Ranke. Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
