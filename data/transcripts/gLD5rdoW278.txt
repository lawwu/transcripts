[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.120]   there's an entire club, actually, on burnout.
[00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.120]   And I brought you up and I brought David Goggins
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.960]   as the process I go through, which is,
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.600]   my passion goes up and down.
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.920]   It dips.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.720]   And I don't think I trust my own mind
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.600]   to tell me whether I'm getting close to burnout
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.840]   or exhaustion or not.
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.280]   I kind of go with the David Goggins model of,
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.240]   I mean, he's probably more applying it to running,
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.120]   but when it feels like your mind can't take any more,
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.800]   that you're just 40% at your capacity.
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.080]   I mean, it's just like an arbitrary level.
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.920]   - It's the Navy SEAL thing, right?
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.040]   - The Navy SEAL thing.
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.600]   I mean, you could put that at any percent,
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.080]   but it is remarkable that if you just take it
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.960]   one step at a time, just keep going,
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.360]   it's similar to this idea of a process.
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.840]   If you just trust the process and you just keep following,
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.440]   even if the passion goes up and down and so on,
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.760]   then ultimately, if you look in aggregate,
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.440]   the passion will increase.
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.840]   Your self-satisfaction will increase.
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.320]   - Yeah, I think, and if you have two things,
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.800]   this has been a big strategy of mine,
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.600]   so that you can, what you hope for is off-phase,
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.440]   off-phase alignment.
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.760]   Like that, sometimes it's in-phase and that's a problem,
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.080]   but off-phase alignment's good.
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.720]   So, okay, my research, I'm struggling,
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.720]   but my book stuff is going well, right?
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.800]   And so when you add those two waves together,
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.800]   it's like, "Oh, we're doing pretty well."
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.480]   And then in other periods, like on my writing,
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.960]   I feel like I'm just not getting anywhere,
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.200]   but oh, I've had some good papers,
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.440]   I'm feeling good over there.
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.000]   So having two things that can counteract each other.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.720]   Now, sometimes they fall into sync and then it gets rough,
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.800]   then when everything, because everything for me is cyclical,
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.320]   good periods, bad periods with all this stuff.
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.640]   So typically they don't coincide, so it helps compensate.
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.440]   When they do coincide, you get really high highs,
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.280]   like where everything's clicking,
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.840]   and then you get these really low lows
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.760]   where like your research is not working,
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.440]   your program's not clicking,
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.360]   you feel like you're nowhere with your writing,
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.720]   and then it's a little rougher.
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.040]   - Is, do you think about the concept of burnout?
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.440]   'Cause I personally have never experienced burnout
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.320]   in the way that folks talk about,
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.760]   which is like, it's not just the up and down,
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.800]   it's like, you don't wanna do anything ever again.
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.640]   - Yeah.
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.720]   - It's like, for some people it's like physical,
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.720]   like to the hospital kind of thing.
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.880]   - Yeah, so I do worry about it.
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.840]   So when I used to do student writing,
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.440]   like writing about students and student advice,
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.440]   it came up a lot with students at elite schools,
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.440]   and I used to call it deep procrastination,
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.440]   but it's a real, really vivid, very replicatable syndrome
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.680]   where they stop being able to do schoolwork.
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.520]   - Yeah.
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.440]   - Like, this is due,
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.000]   and the professor gives you an extension,
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.360]   and the professor gives you an incomplete,
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.200]   and says, you got it, you were gonna fail the course,
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.760]   you have to hand this in, and they can't do it, right?
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.680]   It's like, it's a complete stop
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.480]   on the ability to actually do work.
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.160]   So I used to counsel students who had that issue,
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.520]   and often it was a combination of,
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.720]   this is my best analysis,
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.800]   is you have just the physical and cognitive difficulties,
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.720]   they're usually under a very hard load, right?
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.560]   They're doing too many majors, too many extracurriculars,
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.520]   just really pushing themselves,
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.520]   and the motivation is not sufficiently intrinsic.
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.360]   - Right.
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.360]   - So if you have a motivational center
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.480]   that's not completely on board,
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.760]   so a lot of these kids, like when I'm dealing with MIT kids,
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.240]   they would be, their whole town was shooting off fireworks
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.080]   that they got in,
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.480]   everyone's hoped that they were going there,
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:24.600]   and that they're in three majors,
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:25.600]   they don't wanna let people down,
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.520]   but they're not really interested
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.160]   in being a doctor or whatever.
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.060]   So your motivation's not in the right place,
[00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.560]   the motivational psychologist would say
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.160]   the locus of control was more towards
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.600]   the extrinsic end of the spectrum, and you have hardship.
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.800]   And you could just fritz out the whole system.
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.520]   And so I would always be very worried about that,
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:41.880]   so I think about that a lot.
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.360]   I do a lot of multi-phase or multi-scale seasonality.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.120]   So I'll go hard on something for a while,
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.280]   and then for a few weeks, go easy.
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.920]   I'll have semesters that are hard
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.080]   and semesters that are easy,
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.120]   or I'll take the summer really low.
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.160]   So on multiple scales,
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.640]   and in the day, I'll go really hard on something,
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:57.880]   but then have a hard cutoff at five.
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.880]   So every scale, it's all about rest and recovery,
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:02.920]   because I really wanna avoid that.
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.900]   And I do burn out, I burnt out.
[00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.600]   Pretty recently, I get minor burnt outs.
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.040]   I got a couple papers that I was trying to work through
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.720]   for a deadline a few weeks ago,
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.640]   and I wasn't sleeping well,
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.480]   and there's some other things going on.
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.280]   And it knocks it out of me, I get sick usually,
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.360]   is how I know I've pushed myself too far.
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.440]   And so I kind of pulled it back.
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.440]   Now I'm doing this book launch,
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.680]   then after this book launch, I'm pulling it back again.
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.120]   So seasonality for rest and recovery I think is crucial,
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.680]   and at every scale, daily, monthly,
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.880]   and then at the annual scale.
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.240]   An easy summer, for example,
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.880]   I think is a great idea if that's possible.
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.240]   - Okay, you just made me realize
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.240]   that that's exactly what I do,
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.120]   'cause I feel like I'm not even close
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.080]   to burning out on anything,
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.780]   even though I'm in chaos.
[00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.440]   I feel the right exact ways of seasonality
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.160]   is the, not even the seasonality,
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.000]   but you always have multiple seasons operating.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.120]   It's like you said,
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.800]   'cause when you have a lot of cool shit going on,
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.300]   there's always at least one thing that's a source of joy,
[00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.720]   that there's always a reason.
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.880]   I suppose the fundamental thing,
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.760]   and I've known people that suffer from depression too,
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.760]   the fundamental problem with the experience of depression
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.760]   and burnout is why do, life is meaningless.
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.860]   And I always have an answer of why today could be cool.
[00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.920]   - And you have to contrive it.
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.760]   If you don't have it, you have to contrive it.
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.160]   I think it's really important.
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.840]   Like, okay, well, this is going bad,
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.240]   so now is the time to start thinking about,
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.840]   I mean, look, I started a podcast during the pandemic.
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.260]   It's like, this is going pretty bad,
[00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.240]   but you know what, this could be something
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.320]   really interesting.
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.120]   - Deep questions with Kyle Newport.
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.520]   - I do it all in that voice.
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.480]   - I love the podcast by the way.
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.720]   But yeah, I think David Foster Wallace said,
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.080]   "The key to life is to be unboreable."
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.820]   I've always kind of taken that to heart,
[00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.640]   which is like, you should be able to,
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.700]   maybe artificially generate anything,
[00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:13.700]   like find something in your environment,
[00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.080]   in your surroundings, that's a source of joy.
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.400]   Like everything is fun.
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.140]   - Yeah, did you read "The Pale King"?
[00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:21.540]   It goes deep on boredom.
[00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:22.980]   It's like uncomfortable.
[00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:25.680]   It's like an uncomfortable meditation on boredom.
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.700]   Like the characters in that are just driven
[00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.000]   to the extremes of,
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.360]   I just bought three books on boredom the other day.
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.200]   So now I'm really interested in this topic
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.200]   because I was anxious about my book launch
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.040]   happening this week.
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.560]   I was like, okay, I need something else.
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.080]   So I have this idea for a,
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.560]   I might do it as an article first, but as a book.
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.760]   Like, okay, I need something cool to be thinking about
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.120]   because I was worried about like,
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.800]   I don't know if the launch gonna work,
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.200]   the pandemic, what's gonna happen.
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.160]   I don't know if it's gonna get there.
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.140]   So this is exactly what we're talking about.
[00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.040]   So I went out and I bought a bunch of books
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.160]   and I'm beginning like a whole
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.200]   sort of intellectual exploration.
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.000]   - Well, I think that's one of the profound ideas
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   in deep work that you don't expand on too much is boredom.
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:12.520]   - Yeah, well, so deep work had a superficial idea
[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:13.800]   about boredom, which was,
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.040]   I had this chapter called "Embrace Boredom"
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:19.720]   and a very functionalist idea was basically,
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.700]   you have to have some boredom in your regular schedule
[00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.960]   or your mind is gonna form a Pavlovian connection
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:28.440]   between as soon as I feel boredom, I get stimuli.
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.600]   And once it forms that connection,
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.800]   it's never gonna tolerate deep work.
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.240]   So there's this very pragmatic treatment of boredom
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:36.640]   of your mind better be used to the idea
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:37.880]   that sometimes you don't get stimuli
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.760]   because otherwise you can't write for three hours.
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.780]   Like it's just not gonna tolerate it.
[00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:44.080]   But more recently, what I'm really interested in boredom
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:47.200]   is it as a fundamental human drive, right?
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.720]   Because it's incredibly uncomfortable.
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:50.960]   And think about the other things
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.240]   that are incredibly uncomfortable, like hunger or thirst,
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:56.640]   they serve a really important purpose for our species, right?
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:58.740]   Like if something is really distressing, there's a reason.
[00:07:58.740 --> 00:07:59.960]   Pain is really uncomfortable
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.400]   because we need to worry about getting injured.
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.660]   Thirst is really uncomfortable
[00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:05.580]   because we need water to survive.
[00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:07.000]   So what's boredom?
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.680]   Why is that uncomfortable?
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.480]   And I've been interested in this notion
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:16.480]   that boredom is about driving us towards productive action.
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:19.160]   Like as a species, I mean, think about it.
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.320]   Like what got us to actually take advantage of these brains?
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:24.400]   What got us to actually work with fire?
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:27.680]   What got us to start shaping stones and the hand axes
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.680]   and figuring out if we could actually sharpen a stick
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:32.340]   sharp enough that we could throw it as a melee weapon
[00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:35.240]   or a distance weapon for hunting mammoth, right?
[00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.920]   Boredom drives us towards action.
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:41.460]   So now I'm fascinated by this fundamental action instinct
[00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:43.520]   because I have this theory that I'm working on
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:45.760]   that we're out of sync with it.
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.920]   Just like we have this drive for hunger,
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:49.080]   but then we introduced junk food
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.280]   and got out of sync with hunger
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.040]   and it makes us really unhealthy.
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:53.400]   We have this drive towards action,
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.400]   but then we overload ourselves
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:56.780]   and we have all of these distractions.
[00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:58.560]   And then that causes,
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.440]   it's like a cognitive action obesity type things
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:02.800]   because it short circuits the system
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:03.760]   that wants us to do things,
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:04.840]   but we put more things on our plate
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:05.700]   than we can possibly do.
[00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.480]   And then we're really frustrated we can't do them.
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.200]   And we're short circuiting all of our wires.
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.520]   So it all comes back to this question,
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:16.520]   well, what would be the ideal amount of stuff to do
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:18.360]   and type of things to do?
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:19.320]   Like if we wanted to look back
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.680]   at our ancestral environment and say,
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:23.960]   if I could just build from scratch,
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:26.480]   how much work I do and what I work on
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.600]   to be as in touch with that as like paleo people
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.120]   are trying to get their diets in touch with that.
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.280]   And so now I'm just,
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:34.000]   but see, it's something I made up.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.140]   But now I'm going deep on it.
[00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:37.560]   And one of my podcast listeners,
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:39.320]   I was talking about on the show and I was like,
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.400]   well, I keep trying to learn about animals and boredom.
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:42.840]   And she sent me this cool article
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.560]   from an animal behaviorist journal
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:48.080]   about what we know about human boredom versus animal boredom.
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.960]   So trying to figure out that puzzle
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.260]   is the wave that's high.
[00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.120]   So I can get through the wave that's low of like,
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.660]   I don't know about this pandemic book launch.
[00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:59.760]   And my research is stumbling a little bit
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:00.600]   because of the pandemic.
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.640]   And so I needed a nice high.
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:05.320]   So there we go, there's a case study.
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:07.480]   - Well, it's both a case study
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.280]   and a very interesting set of concepts
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:12.240]   'cause I didn't even realize that it's so simple.
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:17.240]   I'm one of the people that has a interesting
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:18.920]   push and pull dynamic with hunger,
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:21.120]   trying to understand the hunger with myself.
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:24.600]   Like I probably have an unhealthy relationship with food.
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:28.400]   I don't know, but there's probably a perfect,
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:32.720]   that's a nice way to think about diet as action.
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:36.480]   There's probably an optimal diet response
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:40.320]   to the experience that our body's telling us,
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:43.260]   the signal that our body's sending, which is hunger.
[00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.800]   And in that same way, boredom is sending a signal.
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.920]   And most of our intellectual activities in this world,
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.760]   our creative activities,
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:56.600]   are essentially a response to that signal.
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.600]   - Yeah, and think about this analogy
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.040]   that we have this hunger instinct
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.920]   that junk food short circuits, right?
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:06.720]   It's like, oh, we'll satisfy that hyper-palatably
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:08.240]   and it doesn't end up well.
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:11.760]   Now think about modern attention engineered,
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.520]   digitally mediated entertainment.
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:16.000]   We have this boredom instinct.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.760]   Oh, we can take care of that
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:20.480]   with a hyper-palatable alternative.
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.240]   Is that gonna lead to a similar problem?
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.720]   - So I've been fasting a lot lately.
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:27.640]   Like I'm doing eating once a day.
[00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:29.600]   I've been doing that for over a month.
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:33.760]   Just eating one meal a day and primarily meat.
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:38.240]   But it's very, fasting has been incredible for me,
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:40.840]   for focus, for well-being, for a few,
[00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:42.640]   I don't know, just for feeling good.
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:45.640]   Okay, we'll put on a chart what makes me feel good.
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:50.640]   And that fasting and eating primarily a meat-based diet
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.480]   makes me feel really good.
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:57.480]   And so, but that ultimately, what fasting did,
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:59.220]   I haven't fasted super long yet,
[00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:02.120]   like a seven-day diet, which I really like to do.
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:05.080]   But even just fasting for a day, for 24 hours,
[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:09.960]   gets you in touch with the signal.
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:10.800]   It's fascinating.
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.320]   Like you get to listen to your,
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:15.000]   learn to listen to your body that like,
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.700]   you know, it's okay to be hungry.
[00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:19.760]   It's like a little signal that sends you stuff.
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:24.120]   And then I get to listen to how it responds
[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:27.480]   when I put food in my body.
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:30.460]   Like, and I get to like, okay, cool.
[00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:33.740]   So like food is a thing that pacifies the signal.
[00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:35.700]   Like, it sounds ridiculous, okay?
[00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:36.540]   You could do that with--
[00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:38.300]   - And do different types of food.
[00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:39.140]   It feels different.
[00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:41.660]   So you learn about what your body wants.
[00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:44.140]   - For some reason, fasting,
[00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:47.340]   it's similar to the deep work, embrace boredom.
[00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:50.380]   Fasting allowed me to go into mode of listening,
[00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:52.080]   of trying to understand the signal,
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:56.920]   that I could say I have an unhealthy appreciation of fruit.
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:57.860]   - Okay.
[00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:59.540]   - I love apples and cherries.
[00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:01.420]   Like, I don't know how to moderate them.
[00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:03.500]   So if you take just same amount of calories,
[00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:05.960]   I don't know, calories matter, but they say calories,
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:10.960]   2000 calories of cherries versus 2000 calories of steak.
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.300]   If I eat 2000 calories of steak,
[00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:15.660]   maybe with just a little bit of like green beans
[00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:19.680]   or cauliflower, I'm going to feel really good,
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:22.380]   fulfilled, focused, and happy.
[00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:24.460]   If I eat cherries, I'm going to be,
[00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:26.360]   I'm going to wake up behind a dumpster,
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:29.760]   crying with like naked, and like, it's just--
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:30.600]   - Shit's all around.
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:34.080]   - Yeah, with everything, and just like bloated,
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:39.080]   just not, and unhappy, and also the mood swings up and down.
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:41.320]   I don't know.
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:44.720]   And I'll be much hungrier the next day.
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.240]   Sometimes it takes a couple of days,
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:50.080]   but when I introduce carbs into the system, too many carbs,
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:53.040]   it starts, it's just unhealthy.
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:56.020]   I go into this rollercoaster as opposed to a calm boat ride
[00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:58.540]   along the river in the Amazon or something like that.
[00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:01.580]   And so fasting was the mechanism for me
[00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:03.940]   to start listening to the body.
[00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:05.940]   I wonder if you can do that same kind of,
[00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:07.860]   I guess that's what meditation a little bit is.
[00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:10.100]   - A little bit, but yeah, listen to boredom.
[00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:11.780]   But so two years ago, I had a book out
[00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:13.540]   called "Digital Minimalism."
[00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:16.100]   And one of the things I was recommending that people do
[00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:18.300]   is basically a 30-day fast,
[00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:20.420]   but from digital personal entertainment,
[00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:21.920]   social media, online videos,
[00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:26.400]   anything that captures your attention and dispels boredom.
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:29.520]   And people were thinking like, oh, this is a detox.
[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:30.720]   Like, I just wanna teach your body
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.760]   not to need the distraction or this or that,
[00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:34.320]   but it really wasn't what I was interested in.
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:37.640]   I wanted there to be space
[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:39.400]   that you could listen to your boredom.
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:41.120]   Like, okay, I can't just dispel it.
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:42.540]   I can't just look at the screen.
[00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:45.140]   And revel in it a little bit and start to listen to it
[00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:48.000]   and say, what is this really pushing me towards?
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.460]   And you take the new stuff,
[00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:51.480]   the new technology off the table and sort of ask,
[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.200]   what is this, what am I craving?
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:56.800]   Like, what's the activity equivalent of 2,000 calories
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:59.360]   of meat with a little bit of green beans on the side?
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:01.600]   And I had 1,700 people go through this experiment,
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:03.400]   like spend 30 days doing this.
[00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:04.280]   And it's hard at first,
[00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:06.960]   but then they get used to listening to themselves
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:07.800]   and sort of seeking out
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.720]   what is this really pushing me towards?
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:12.240]   And it was pushing people towards connection.
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:13.420]   It was pushing people towards,
[00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:15.560]   I just wanna go be around other people.
[00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:19.320]   It was pushing people towards high quality leisure activities
[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:21.680]   like I wanna go do something that's complicated.
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:23.040]   And it took weeks sometimes
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:25.100]   for them to get in touch with their boredom,
[00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:28.740]   but then it completely rewired how they thought about,
[00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:30.740]   what do I wanna do with my time outside of work?
[00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:32.020]   And then the idea is when you're done with that,
[00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:33.280]   then it was much easier to go back
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:34.900]   and completely change your digital life
[00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:37.380]   because you have alternatives, right?
[00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:39.820]   You're not just trying to abstain from things you don't like
[00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:42.620]   but that's basically a listening to boredom experiment.
[00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:45.140]   And like, just be there with the boredom
[00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:46.360]   and see where it drives you
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:48.820]   when you don't have the digital cheez-its.
[00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:50.900]   Okay, so if I can't do that,
[00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:52.000]   where is it gonna drive me?
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.940]   Well, I guess I kinda wanna go to the library,
[00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:55.020]   which came up a lot, by the way.
[00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:57.420]   A lot of people rediscovered the library.
[00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:58.260]   - With physical books.
[00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.440]   - Physical books, so you can just go borrow 'em.
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:03.180]   And there's low pressure and you can explore
[00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:04.860]   and you bring 'em home and then you read 'em
[00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:06.580]   and you can sit by the window and read 'em
[00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:07.660]   and it's nice weather outside.
[00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:09.700]   And I used to do that 20 years ago.
[00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:11.340]   They're listening to boredom.
[00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:12.460]   Hey, if you like this video,
[00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:15.120]   I think you'll really like this one as well.
