[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.220]   We begin with Nick in New York.
[00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.040]   Nick, welcome to the show.
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.820]   How can I serve you today?
[00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.080]   - Thank you, Joshua.
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.720]   For the last four or five years,
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.620]   I have been using Wealthfront as a robotic advisor
[00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.160]   for my non-tax-advantaged account.
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.960]   And I started it because I like the lower,
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.700]   let's say, overhead that they charge, which is 0.25%.
[00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.240]   And I don't really know how to invest myself,
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.400]   so I just thought I would just give it my risk profile
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.400]   and then it would invest.
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.580]   And I feel like it has done well.
[00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.780]   But after five years and after the account
[00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.280]   has become more sizable than it used to be,
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.760]   I was wondering if you advise people
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.060]   for or against these robot advisors.
[00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:36.320]   - I usually avoid taking a position on that
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.640]   in some ways similar to the position
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.200]   that I avoid taking on DIY investing
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.080]   versus working with a traditional personal advisor.
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.720]   It's not that I couldn't make arguments
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.840]   one way or the other, but as I look at it,
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.920]   in order to decide what's right for one person
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.400]   and what's right for another,
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.080]   you have to gain quite a lot of details
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.000]   about the person's financial situation.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.760]   You have to ask for quite a lot of details
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.760]   about what's going on, what their interests are,
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.320]   what their plans are, et cetera, and then get a good idea.
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.080]   Think of it like this.
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.920]   Do you, Nick, change your own oil on your car?
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.160]   - I don't. - Why don't you?
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.920]   Why do you pay for that to be done?
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.120]   - For multiple reasons.
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.840]   I think if I ever want to sell the car,
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.920]   I want there to be a record that I've done,
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.400]   you know, regular oil changes,
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.440]   and I guess there's no record when you do them yourself.
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.520]   And also because I guess of the,
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.880]   part of this is, of course, the hassle.
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.160]   Like, I understand how to do it.
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.200]   I can watch YouTube videos that will tell me how to do it,
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.440]   but sometimes it's just easier to bring it to someone.
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.920]   - Right, right.
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.640]   So it's an imperfect example
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.360]   because we're talking about a huge difference in money
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.400]   if you've got a million dollars under management
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.240]   and you're gonna be paying, you know,
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.160]   50 basis points or 100 basis points
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.400]   or whatever you're paying in terms of fees
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.120]   to whomever is helping you with that
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.600]   versus the cost of an oil change.
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.560]   So let's acknowledge that up front.
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.600]   But the reason I indicate that is it's a decent metaphor.
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.640]   Most of us have cars.
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.800]   Our cars need their oil changed, generally speaking,
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:13.840]   but not all of them.
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.000]   And so we can learn from this metaphor for a moment
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.800]   and apply some of these things to the decision
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.440]   of whether we should work with a financial advisor.
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.400]   The process of changing your oil
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.400]   is actually eminently simple.
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.740]   Anybody can do it.
[00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.360]   You just simply go buy an oil filter, buy oil.
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.120]   You put a pan under the car.
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.300]   You drop the oil filter out.
[00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.900]   You drain the oil from the engine.
[00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.160]   You put a new filter on.
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.240]   You fill it up with oil and you're done.
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.800]   And it's very, very simple and straightforward to do.
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.440]   But just because it's simple and straightforward to do
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.620]   doesn't necessarily mean that it's right
[00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.560]   for everyone to do for himself.
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.680]   First, you have to have appropriate equipment.
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.200]   And so what is that equipment?
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.640]   Well, it can be simple.
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.920]   It can just be a bucket, literally almost any bucket.
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.000]   But then you have to figure out,
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.200]   what do I do with the oil?
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.420]   Do I get a bucket that's big enough if I mess things up?
[00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.320]   You have to go and make sure you have an oil wrench
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.160]   for your car.
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.360]   You have to stockpile the stuff.
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.840]   You might wanna get some jack stands
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.760]   or some ramps to make it a little easier.
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.120]   Where are you gonna get the oil from?
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.680]   How much are you gonna actually save, et cetera.
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.580]   And then as you said, well, maybe there's value
[00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.420]   of having someone else looking at my stuff.
[00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:21.460]   A lot of people take their car to the dealership
[00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.880]   and what they wanna do is have the oil changed
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.660]   so they have a record of it being changed regularly
[00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:27.500]   at the dealership.
[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.680]   But they also wanna make sure
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.100]   that there's other mechanics around
[00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.740]   and they can have other things fixed while they're there.
[00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.180]   They can have other questions answered, et cetera.
[00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:41.180]   And so a similar thing happens with financial advice.
[00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.420]   Anybody can manage his or her own money.
[00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:47.780]   You don't need a financial advisor of any sort.
[00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.240]   Anybody can do it.
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.220]   But whether you should or should not manage your money
[00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.480]   becomes an intensely personal thing
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.000]   based upon what you like doing with your time.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.720]   Do you enjoy going out there and working on the car
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:00.760]   or do you not enjoy that?
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.920]   Is that a leisure activity for you or is it a chore?
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.680]   It matters whether how much it's gonna cost you,
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.660]   how much the oil is.
[00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.840]   If an oil change is $300 versus $65,
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.400]   a lot more people would change their oil.
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.400]   And I'm not gonna go on and on with examples,
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.500]   but if you think about the example of changing your own oil,
[00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.120]   you recognize anybody can change their own oil,
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.300]   so why doesn't everybody do that?
[00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.200]   So what I would look at is I would say,
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.640]   start with an overview of your situation.
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.680]   You look down and you say, how am I doing financially?
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.560]   Where are my biggest opportunities?
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:35.920]   How am I doing?
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.980]   And then how did I come
[00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:41.560]   to my current financial investing strategy?
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:46.560]   What is best for me based upon where I'm at right now?
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.000]   Am I willing to go and learn more?
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   Am I happy with the strategy of having this done
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.160]   automatically by a rebel advisor?
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.120]   What is the impact to me of saving the money?
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.320]   How much money can I actually save?
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.240]   Am I willing to go out and learn from it?
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.960]   Do I want and need a higher service model
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:06.860]   where I pay even more money to get higher service?
[00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:08.720]   Or do I wanna switch to a different model
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.680]   where I pay less money to get something simpler
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.320]   and more straightforward?
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:16.800]   And if you think about the answers to those questions
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.320]   and you calculate the costs
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.700]   and you review the latest performance data,
[00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:24.760]   you review the promotional literature from Wealthfront,
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:27.840]   from the other competitors, et cetera,
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:31.640]   then you'll feel well to make an informed decision.
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.880]   I don't think there's a wrong decision in it.
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.040]   If you come to me and you say, hey, I'm really enjoying
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.400]   and appreciating the use of this robo advisor,
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.560]   great, fine, wonderful, it's the right decision.
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:41.680]   I'm not saying it's wrong.
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.080]   If you say, I wanna get rid of this robo advisor
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.680]   and go to something even cheaper
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.080]   because I wanna save these few basis points
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.640]   that they're charging me, great, okay, that's fine.
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.640]   If you say, I wanna go to a financial advisor, great.
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:56.200]   And so it may sound a little wishy-washy,
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:00.320]   but I see it as important to look at
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.360]   what's the actual cost to me, who am I as a person,
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:06.080]   what services do I want and need and value,
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.000]   and then how do I take that to the marketplace
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.520]   and make an informed decision?
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.880]   - Right, yeah, that's fair.
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:15.480]   I mean, I think that I had called you a few months ago
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:18.120]   and I asked you about how does one break into investing,
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.840]   you know, what book should I read?
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:21.320]   And I in fact did buy a book,
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.360]   but I quit after chapter three or four
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:27.640]   because I thought I had kind of better uses of my time.
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:31.760]   So I feel like I understand the benefits
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.560]   of this robo advisor because I've been using it
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:34.880]   for four or five years.
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:36.720]   I guess I was just asking whether there are
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:39.520]   any obvious downsides that you knew about
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.400]   since this is your area of expertise,
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:44.520]   the more general, personal finance and investment.
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:48.840]   - The downside with all investment solutions
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.680]   is that you pay for them.
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.520]   And the performance of an investment solution
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:59.440]   depends largely on the time period under which you hold it.
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.800]   So if we, I have not reviewed
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.160]   the Wealthfront promotional literature in years,
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.080]   nor have I tried to keep tabs on what they're doing
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.240]   or what they're charging.
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:11.520]   Do you know how much they're charging you on your account?
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.600]   - Yeah, it's a flat 0.25.
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:18.600]   - Okay, so obviously a flat 0.25% expense ratio
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:22.400]   is a lot cheaper than what you would pay
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.560]   with an individual personal financial advisor.
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.440]   But it's more expensive than what you would pay
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:31.040]   with just simply buying the mutual funds themselves.
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:34.600]   And even buying a mutual fund is more expensive
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.440]   than what you would pay for just buying the stocks themselves.
[00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:41.880]   So it's, I really want to give you an answer,
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:42.960]   but I have to be honest.
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:46.080]   And that honest answer is, I don't really care.
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.760]   All I care about is that you like what you're doing
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:51.260]   and that you're comfortable with sticking with it.
[00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:56.080]   And in terms of the overall performance,
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:59.080]   a company like Wealthfront has to do a better job
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:02.720]   of justifying its fees to you than for example,
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.800]   many individual financial advisors.
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.080]   And that's a good thing.
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.800]   It's good to have the pressure on them
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.280]   that they have to justify their fees.
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:15.280]   But the relative performance or over performance
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:18.800]   or under performance and trying to figure out
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.760]   is the performance nexus of the fees
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:24.800]   depends on long-term market cycles
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.640]   more than it does on what has happened
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:28.200]   over the last say five years
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:31.320]   that you may have been in it.
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:33.940]   So the future very clearly involves
[00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:37.240]   this kind of automated trading.
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:41.600]   This is, I think, I've been out of the financial,
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.360]   the inside business for a while,
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:45.140]   but I would be pretty confident saying
[00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:49.320]   that this technology is now basically standard issue broadly
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:52.480]   across at least large financial planning firms.
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:55.720]   This is now, like this is standard.
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:58.160]   So it's not that there's a problem with it.
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.520]   I'm not upset about paying it,
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.720]   but you should take a look at your own account
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:05.160]   and then compare it to what your hypothetical alternative is
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:09.160]   and see, hey, what I save, how much would I have performed
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:13.220]   if I weren't paying this 0.25% expense ratio?
[00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:16.400]   Do I feel happy with the fact that this is being done
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.420]   and automatically rebalanced for me?
[00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:20.260]   I don't have an opinion on what you should do.
[00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.760]   I would just encourage you to make an informed decision
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:23.860]   as you're doing.
[00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:25.920]   The fact that you bought a book on investing
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:28.240]   and didn't love it and weren't that interested in it
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.440]   is a good sign to you that some form
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:33.240]   of simple automated approach
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:37.040]   is probably a very good fit for you.
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:40.600]   And you probably should continue with that in mind,
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.680]   recognizing this is a standardized automated approach
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:46.380]   of some kind and thus it's probably the best for me.
[00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:48.320]   - Right.
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:49.360]   Yeah, that's fair enough.
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:51.720]   Yeah, I think that I would probably,
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:52.920]   if I were to move,
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:54.360]   you know,
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:12:01.320]   I would be hesitant to take more responsibility on myself.
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.900]   So I would move towards something else.
[00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:04.280]   And like you said,
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:09.280]   unless I just move horizontally to another robot advisor,
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:10.820]   then I would be moving to a person
[00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:14.120]   and then the rate, the overhead would increase substantially.
[00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.120]   That's my understanding.
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.120]   - Yeah, and there's a good chance that your portfolio
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:20.220]   is not at the range yet of which a person
[00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:22.760]   would even particularly be helpful to you.
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:24.440]   So that's what I love.
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:25.920]   I mean, the great thing,
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:29.480]   let me just speak positively about Wealthfront
[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:32.880]   and about this industry in general.
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:33.880]   In the United States,
[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:37.440]   we are so blessed to have such a range of great options
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:40.920]   that serve small and medium-sized investors.
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:42.880]   And this is the market at work
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.280]   and it has provided these solutions
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:47.000]   in a really strong and powerful way.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.520]   And so we are all better off that these solutions exist
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.440]   because they help people who are coming up,
[00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:56.360]   financially, to get great world-class investment products
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:57.880]   at a very low cost.
[00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:00.880]   And automated software-based solutions,
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:04.000]   like Wealthfront and other robo advisors,
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.720]   allow you to have a high quality product
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:10.120]   when your account values are not high enough
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:15.120]   to attract the attention of a personal financial advisor.
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:17.760]   And so I think it's a wonderful thing
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:19.000]   and I'm glad they exist.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.920]   It has helped immensely to bring value
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:23.840]   to the investment marketplace.
[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:26.080]   - Great, great.
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:26.920]   - Anything else, Mike?
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:27.760]   - I have one more question.
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.080]   - Yeah, go ahead. - I have one more question
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:29.920]   at the time.
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:33.840]   - Now for a limited time at Delamo Motorsports.
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:37.520]   Get financing as low as 1.99% for 36 months
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:40.760]   on Select 2023 Can-Am Maverick X3.
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:43.400]   Considering the Mavericks taking home trophies everywhere
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:46.880]   from King of the Hammers to Uncle Ned's Backcountry Rally,
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:48.760]   you're not going to find a better deal
[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:51.680]   on front row seats to a championship winner.
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:54.800]   Don't lose out on your chance to get a Maverick X3.
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:58.400]   Visit Delamo Motorsports in Redondo Beach and get yours.
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:01.040]   Offer in soon, see dealer for details.
[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:04.320]   - I have heard that in previous shows,
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:07.120]   people have asked the questions about umbrella insurance.
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:12.720]   And I'm an outsider to the general field of insurances.
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:16.040]   So I have a term life insurance and that's about it.
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:16.880]   - Good.
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:18.280]   - I was wondering if you could give me like,
[00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:21.600]   the elevator pitch of what is an umbrella insurance
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:23.760]   and who should look for one.
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:25.320]   - The primary reason you buy
[00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:28.960]   an umbrella liability insurance policy
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:32.440]   is that it protects you from large claims
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:35.160]   of liability and lawsuits.
[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:36.960]   This is the first,
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:40.640]   one of, this is one of the first forms of defense
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:44.880]   against people who want to sue you and take your money.
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:47.360]   And so this is some of the upfront,
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:51.120]   extremely effective, very low cost protection
[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:53.560]   in the asset protection world.
[00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:57.200]   As your assets grow and you become wealthier,
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:00.520]   you become more of a target for somebody to want to sue you
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:02.480]   for something that you have done wrong.
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:07.480]   This is largely, but not entirely, an American issue
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:11.720]   where in the United States, we have far more lawsuits,
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:13.680]   we have a much more litigious culture.
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:17.200]   Attorneys are incentivized to go out and solicit people
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:19.120]   to sue other people, et cetera.
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:20.920]   So this brings a significant legal risk
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.440]   to protecting your wealth.
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:24.680]   And so when you go through the approach
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:26.080]   of how do you protect your wealth,
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:27.920]   there are a few basic things
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:30.400]   that everybody can and should do.
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:32.960]   If you've never listened to my series
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:35.440]   on asset protection planning for mere mortals,
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:37.520]   I would encourage you to go back and listen to that series.
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:40.320]   I can't remember, 10 to 15 episodes, something like that,
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:42.160]   that I did on the subject where I went through it.
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:47.160]   And I covered insurance fairly extensively in that show.
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:49.660]   But when you are protecting
[00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:51.680]   against your potential liability,
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:55.120]   there are a few basic things that everybody does.
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.160]   So the first thing you do
[00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:58.800]   is you try to reduce your liability.
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:01.680]   You try to eliminate things that you do
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:04.560]   that could give rise to potential liability.
[00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:06.400]   So if you're currently in the habit
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.920]   of drinking and driving, stop it.
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:13.320]   Use an Uber or a taxi because that lowers your liability.
[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:14.680]   If you're currently in the habit
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:17.040]   of driving your fancy speedboat
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:19.080]   around the tiny lake in back of your house
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:20.300]   where children are swimming
[00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:22.620]   and you drive it around at 75 miles an hour
[00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:24.500]   endangering the children, stop it
[00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:26.940]   'cause that's giving rise to liability.
[00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:28.580]   If you're currently in the habit
[00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:31.060]   of pinching the bottoms of your attractive coworkers,
[00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:33.400]   stop it because that's gonna give rise
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:34.900]   to some sort of lawsuit.
[00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:37.220]   So you eliminate activities
[00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:41.100]   that could give rise to liability as best you can
[00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:43.860]   in order to protect yourself from the risk.
[00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:46.580]   The next thing you do is you insure
[00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:49.160]   against those risks that still exist.
[00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:51.280]   And so when you're driving an automobile,
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:54.080]   you are inherently doing a risky thing.
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:56.840]   You could drive over somebody and kill them.
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.960]   You could bang into somebody's car and damage it.
[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:02.700]   You could drive over somebody's mailbox and destroy it.
[00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:07.700]   All of these things are potentially sources of liability.
[00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:10.300]   And so you insure against those.
[00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:11.640]   Yes, you try to drive carefully.
[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:14.040]   You try to make sure that you don't drive fast
[00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:14.880]   where you run over somebody.
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:16.360]   You try to make sure you drive defensively
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:18.480]   so you don't bang into somebody.
[00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:19.720]   You put a dash cam on your car
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:22.160]   so you have good evidence of your careful driving
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.820]   so that when the mailbox is damaged,
[00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:25.780]   you can prove that it wasn't your fault.
[00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:28.400]   So you do the things that minimize the liability,
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.880]   but you also protect yourself with insurance.
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:33.360]   So you generally, in the US system,
[00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:35.920]   you insure your car and you insure your house.
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:38.060]   So before you add umbrella liability,
[00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:40.080]   you increase the liability coverage
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:43.280]   of your insurance policies on your vehicles
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:45.480]   and on your homeowner's policy.
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:48.560]   Now, as your assets continue to grow beyond that,
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:51.520]   you will then look at what forms of protection are there.
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:54.660]   So for example, you'll maximize your exemptions.
[00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:57.440]   Any exempt assets that you can invest into,
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:02.440]   such as a 401(k) or an IRA or a life insurance policy
[00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:05.960]   or home equity, these assets, depending on your state laws,
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.800]   may be exempt from the claims of creditors.
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:11.340]   And so this is a primary focus for you to,
[00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:13.660]   this is a primary place for you to begin
[00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:18.660]   with your actual plan of setting money into those buckets.
[00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:20.080]   As your assets grow though,
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:21.520]   you'll start to accumulate assets
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:23.400]   that are not protected by those buckets.
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:25.400]   And you'll want more and more protection
[00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:26.800]   because as your wealth grows,
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:29.960]   you become a bigger target for lawsuits.
[00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:33.000]   A lawyer is not gonna sue you if he thinks you're broke.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   So, but if it's obvious that you're not broke,
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.800]   then the lawyer is more likely to go ahead
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:38.280]   and help somebody to sue you.
[00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:41.280]   And so that's where umbrella liability insurance comes in
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:44.300]   because it's very, very inexpensive
[00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:47.500]   in terms of the actual cost, the premiums,
[00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:49.200]   but it's the first line of defense
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:52.140]   against the vast majority of liability that you might face.
[00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:54.740]   And so it can put in place a buffer of a million dollars,
[00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:58.260]   two million dollars, five million dollars of insurance
[00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:01.080]   that would be paid out if somebody sued you
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:02.940]   and won their case against you
[00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:05.460]   before your personal assets would ever be approached.
[00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:07.860]   So as your wealth grows,
[00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:10.620]   I just commit to you the rule that was given to me
[00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:15.020]   by Ken Zahn when I was preparing for my CFP exam.
[00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:17.100]   He said, "If you see on the CFP exam
[00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:20.340]   liability insurance as a possible answer,
[00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:23.860]   then tick that answer because no matter what,
[00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:25.260]   more liability insurance,"
[00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:26.860]   I'm sorry, umbrella liability insurance.
[00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:27.900]   Let me rephrase that.
[00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:29.540]   "If you see umbrella liability insurance
[00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:31.460]   as a possible answer, tick that box
[00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:33.400]   because more umbrella liability insurance
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:34.980]   is always the right solution."
[00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:38.580]   So I submit that to you as a useful heuristic.
[00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:41.260]   - So if I understand correctly,
[00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:45.380]   effectively the umbrella liability kicks in
[00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:49.100]   after your regular, like in the context of a car accident,
[00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:52.980]   in the context of something going wrong at your property.
[00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:53.820]   - Yes.
[00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:55.500]   - The first wave is absorbed by that insurance
[00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:59.220]   and then whatever is left
[00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:00.700]   will be covered through the liability one.
[00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:01.540]   - Correct.
[00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:02.500]   Your insurance agent will help you
[00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:04.540]   to harmonize your insurance policies
[00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:06.620]   so that where the umbrella, excuse me,
[00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:08.960]   where the liability coverage on your home ends,
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:11.500]   that's where your umbrella policy kicks in.
[00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:14.500]   It's the umbrella that goes over your other policies.
[00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:17.660]   And so you wanna, you could have a donut hole in the middle,
[00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:18.660]   but generally speaking,
[00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:21.500]   you'll want to harmonize your liability limit
[00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:23.460]   so they work beautifully between
[00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:25.420]   your other liability coverages
[00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:27.340]   and your umbrella liability policy.
[00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:29.060]   - Okay.
[00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:30.740]   And so how would you, just quickly,
[00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:32.620]   how would you advise me to go about,
[00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:35.140]   let's say I wanna get one,
[00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:36.620]   how do I actually go about that?
[00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:37.740]   Because you talked about an agent
[00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:40.320]   that I'm used to online things still with,
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:45.160]   you know, DICO and other general online things.
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:47.960]   - Start with the existing relationships that you have.
[00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:50.740]   Even if you are used to online things,
[00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:53.780]   then most of these companies with whom you interact
[00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:56.360]   will want to sell you umbrella liability coverage.
[00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:59.760]   And it's not possible, recognize,
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:03.000]   it's not possible to buy insurance without an agent.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.100]   Even if you're interacting with an online website,
[00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:06.860]   there's still licensed insurance agents
[00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:09.360]   who are selling you those policies.
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:10.520]   What you should always consider,
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:14.480]   I give the same advice that I give generally to anybody,
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:19.080]   is interacting with in-person insurance agents
[00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:21.640]   is often an excellent idea
[00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:25.760]   because the market pressures of the online-only brokerages
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:28.640]   keep prices down largely across the board,
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:31.600]   but the agents, their job is still to serve you.
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:35.920]   And so the offer you, the choice you have is,
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:38.200]   do I want the commission that's being paid
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:42.600]   on this insurance policy to go directly to a company,
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:44.520]   or do I want the commission that's being paid
[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:47.720]   to go to an individual who actually speaks to me?
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:49.640]   There are exceptions to this.
[00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:53.500]   And so if we moved into the property and casualty world,
[00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:58.500]   you'll have sometimes a company that only sells direct.
[00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:02.200]   So for example, USAA or Amica Mutual
[00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:05.040]   or some of these companies that are high-quality companies,
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:07.040]   and the only way you can work with them,
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:08.480]   they don't broker their business out,
[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:10.000]   the only way you can work with them
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.400]   is to work directly with the company.
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:14.260]   And so this exists at the high end of the market
[00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:15.880]   and also at the low end of the market.
[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:18.180]   So if you have existing relationships,
[00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:19.720]   just start by calling the company
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:22.520]   that you already work with and talking to them.
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:24.860]   And even if you're not used to working with an individual,
[00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:27.960]   they will put an insurance agent on the phone with you
[00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:30.440]   who can go through these options with you,
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:32.520]   and there may be some price breaks
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:35.920]   where you bundle your insurance policies together.
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:37.000]   That's where you start.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.120]   Then absent that, just look around your area
[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:43.540]   and call or talk to some liability insurance,
[00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:47.120]   property and casualty and liability insurance office
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:48.720]   or broker of some kind.
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:51.960]   And if you look around, you'll find people in your area
[00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:53.720]   and in your neighborhood that do that work
[00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:54.640]   and you can talk to them.
[00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:55.680]   And they'll broker their business
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:57.160]   with a variety of different companies,
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:58.400]   and you can review their quotes
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:00.180]   and compare that to what you have
[00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:03.400]   and see what is best for your situation.

[00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:37.340]   Thank you, Joshua.
[00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:38.180]   - My pleasure.
[00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:41.200]   We go on to Andy in Indiana.
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.040]   Andy, welcome to the show.
[00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:43.600]   How can I serve you today?
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:44.440]   - Hi, Joshua.
[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:45.640]   Thank you for taking my call.
[00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:47.160]   - My pleasure.
[00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:49.640]   - My general question is,
[00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:52.200]   do you have a good idea or a program
[00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:54.640]   that you'd recommend for determining
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:57.560]   what I'm good at and what I like?
[00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:00.880]   I find that generally I am fairly competent
[00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:02.200]   and fairly easygoing,
[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:05.180]   so most of the jobs I've had have been successful at
[00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:06.960]   and I haven't particularly hated,
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:08.260]   even if I don't love them.
[00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:12.380]   I've been looking at moving within my own company
[00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:14.600]   or possibly even to a different company,
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:17.840]   and I have a hard time articulating,
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:19.640]   well, I'm good at this and I'm bad at that,
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:22.580]   or I really like this and I really don't.
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:29.880]   - What personality tests have you already taken?
[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:30.720]   Any at all?
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:33.320]   - I've taken Strength Finders.
[00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:36.160]   I've taken Enneagram.
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:39.820]   I think I've taken a couple others in the pile up.
[00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:44.500]   True Colors, I think is what that one's called.
[00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:48.620]   - And have they not given you anything that was useful?
[00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:54.720]   - I guess I've had trouble aligning that with actual work.
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:59.040]   Strength Finders is a little bit more oriented
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:02.120]   towards the work that you do.
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:04.040]   And maybe my question should be,
[00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:11.840]   how do I judge characteristics that make a particular job,
[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:16.240]   make you successful at a particular type of job in specific?
[00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:22.760]   I just have not had much luck in my own head saying,
[00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:27.520]   hey, because I'm good at this, I would be good at that.
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:31.600]   - You've listed several personality tests
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:33.240]   that I have not taken.
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:35.840]   And so you probably have more insight
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:39.720]   even than into the test than I could specifically say.
[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:42.480]   It's been now probably six or eight years
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:44.320]   since I have carefully gone out
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:48.880]   and researched the marketplace on these things.
[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:51.200]   I did it in preparation for my career and income course,
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:53.480]   which I launched, again, probably six or seven years ago
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:55.600]   that hasn't been on the market for a few years.
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:59.760]   But when I did that, I went out and I did a careful survey
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:02.400]   of all the tests that were then in vogue
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:07.400]   and looked into them, but that knowledge is now decaying.
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:10.440]   And the one that impressed me the most,
[00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:13.520]   but when I went through and took them all and studied them,
[00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:16.340]   the one that impressed me the most was the DISC profile.
[00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:18.420]   And so if you haven't done that one,
[00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:20.140]   again, this is five years out of date,
[00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:20.980]   but that's the best one.
[00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:22.520]   You have taken that one?
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:23.880]   - I have taken that one, I forgot about that one.
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:28.600]   - Did it not give you any kind of career categories?
[00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:33.300]   - I did it through another program and it didn't,
[00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:37.760]   I didn't get that, but maybe it would be available
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:41.860]   if I went back through their material based on my results.
[00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:46.780]   - The reason that one impressed me is,
[00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:50.040]   I see there are two paths to answering this question.
[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:52.720]   Path number one is personal introspection
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:54.300]   and self-analysis.
[00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:58.240]   Path number two is external testing and advice.
[00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:00.880]   So I, when I was younger,
[00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:02.880]   I didn't know anything about path number two.
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:05.900]   Nobody gave me counsel to go and speak to a career counselor
[00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:08.520]   to take a battery of personality tests.
[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:10.560]   I was kind of making it up as I went along.
[00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:13.120]   And so the way I engaged in introspection
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:16.400]   was I kept a running list of every job
[00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:18.720]   that I thought would be interesting to me.
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:22.120]   And I tried to take note of why I was interested in it.
[00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:26.040]   And I wouldn't censor myself or choose
[00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:28.080]   based upon any external things.
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:30.760]   So for example, I wrote on my list
[00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:33.580]   that I would enjoy being a barista at Starbucks.
[00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:34.420]   Why?
[00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:36.400]   Well, I enjoy the coffee shop atmosphere.
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:38.320]   I just enjoyed being in Starbucks.
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:39.800]   I enjoyed the coffee shop atmosphere.
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:41.080]   I spent a lot of time there.
[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:42.920]   And I thought how pleasant it would be
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:45.660]   to be in just a friendly environment like this
[00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:47.000]   throughout the day.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.840]   Similarly, I at one point had on my list
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:51.760]   that I would enjoy working at Panera Bread.
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:52.600]   Why?
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:53.840]   Well, the same basic idea.
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:55.440]   I enjoy the atmosphere.
[00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:57.440]   But then I thought, well, I would also enjoy
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:00.540]   owning a restaurant or owning my own place.
[00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:01.380]   Why?
[00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:02.620]   Well, because I enjoy the atmosphere.
[00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:04.880]   And I also, if I had my own restaurant
[00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:07.780]   or I had my own coffee shop,
[00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:11.080]   that would give me the opportunity to bring people together
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:13.600]   and facilitate fellowship within a community.
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:16.580]   And so I would see a great deal of purpose in that.
[00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:18.480]   But then I also quickly wrote that I don't have
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:19.740]   any interest in owning a restaurant
[00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:22.120]   'cause I don't like to work at nights and on weekends.
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:24.240]   So it would have to be a breakfast and lunch cafe
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:26.560]   if I did it, or I would have to find a solution.
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:29.180]   And so I would go around the world observing things.
[00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:31.480]   At one point, I had on my list that I should go
[00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:33.840]   and work for a large international hotel chain.
[00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:34.680]   Why?
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:37.500]   Well, I enjoy traveling and it's really fun.
[00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:40.960]   And I'm studying international business at the time.
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:43.280]   And so this would be a pretty good application
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:44.120]   of international business.
[00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:47.280]   So if I go work for Hilton Hotels or Marriott Hotels,
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:49.780]   et cetera, then I have the opportunity
[00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:52.020]   to go among their hotels and work my way up
[00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:53.040]   through a corporation.
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:54.860]   And since I enjoy the travel industry
[00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:56.460]   based upon my personal experiences,
[00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:58.900]   this might be something that I would enjoy.
[00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:01.980]   Now, these are just a few of the silly entry,
[00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:03.460]   not silly, but these are just a few
[00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:07.020]   of the entry-level indications that I said,
[00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:08.500]   but I kept a lot of these.
[00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:11.420]   So another example, I read Tom Stanley's books,
[00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:12.240]   all of his books.
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:15.220]   And he repeatedly talked about the value
[00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:18.180]   of how a large blue-collar business owner
[00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:20.220]   can often be the wealthiest guy out there.
[00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:23.460]   And so one of his businesses that he talked about
[00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:25.260]   was the scrap metal business.
[00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:27.460]   Generally, a guy who runs a scrap metal business
[00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:29.380]   can be exceedingly wealthy.
[00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:30.680]   People have no idea how much money
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:32.180]   he can make scrapping stuff.
[00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:37.180]   And yet he winds up having low expenses
[00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:41.100]   'cause he just, he shows up to work
[00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:43.240]   in an old beat-up F-150 and a pair of blue jeans,
[00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:44.940]   and he makes a million dollars a year.
[00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:46.960]   And so I wrote that down.
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:48.960]   Hey, there's a cool idea that could make a lot of money,
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:52.120]   low competition, et cetera.
[00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:54.680]   So I just would keep these lists of any job
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:56.960]   or business that sounded interesting to me.
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:00.260]   I knew growing up, I loved listening to talk radio.
[00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:03.540]   And so I listened to a local talk radio station
[00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:06.760]   in my town that was just a kind of a statewide
[00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:09.240]   or region within a few county area,
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:10.140]   but it was very successful.
[00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:11.340]   I would listen to them all day long,
[00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:13.400]   and they were a little bit vulgar,
[00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:15.640]   but I really enjoyed the talk radio experience.
[00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:17.600]   I would listen to Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck,
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:20.300]   and those were my two favorites when I was in high school.
[00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:21.940]   So I'm driving a tractor across a field
[00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:24.720]   listening to talk radio, and I thought I could do that.
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:26.540]   Like, I would enjoy that.
[00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:30.760]   And I liked to write, I loved reading Tom Clancy books
[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:32.960]   since I always imagined, here's Tom Clancy
[00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:34.200]   sitting out with his computer
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:36.060]   creating this masterpiece of a novel.
[00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:36.900]   I would love that.
[00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:38.560]   I would enjoy being a writer.
[00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:42.520]   So those are just six examples that won't surprise anybody
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:43.600]   who's ever listened to my podcast
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:46.060]   because these are qualities that come through.
[00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:48.580]   What impressed me about the DISC assessment
[00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:50.720]   is that when I went through and took it,
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:53.620]   every single job that they suggested for me
[00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:56.300]   was either something that I had done
[00:30:56.300 --> 00:31:00.400]   or that I had on my list of things I would enjoy doing.
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:04.800]   And so that was what biased me to say, that's great,
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:07.200]   because I could have saved myself years of introspection
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:08.640]   if I had done that.
[00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:11.760]   So my first recommendation would be
[00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:14.080]   just engage in introspection
[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:18.880]   and write down any job that you have heard of
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:21.880]   someone else doing, or that you've read in a novel
[00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:23.280]   or something that sounds something
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:25.280]   that's remotely interesting to you.
[00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:27.400]   And to the extent that it's possible,
[00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:31.640]   make a note of why it's attractive to you personally.
[00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:34.120]   You know, I always thought it'd be fun to be a sheepherder.
[00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:38.840]   I saw the sheep wagons that the sheepherders live in
[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:40.320]   way out in the boonies,
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:42.640]   and I thought I'd love to live in a little tiny wagon,
[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:45.040]   be an old guy sitting out there,
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:48.280]   reading books and watching the sheep, that appeals to me.
[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:50.200]   Well, I'm not gonna go and be a sheepherder
[00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:51.620]   at this stage of my life,
[00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:53.760]   but it's still interesting to have made note of that
[00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:56.560]   so that maybe at a different phase of my life and career,
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:32:00.400]   I might incorporate more of that lonely hermit lifestyle
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:03.080]   into my approach.
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:06.880]   So if you're not getting any help with the external stuff,
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:09.220]   then engage in introspection.
[00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:11.480]   On the other hand, flip to the external stuff.
[00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:16.480]   If you have done your best in the DIY environment
[00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:21.480]   and you have not been able to discover a successful path,
[00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:25.680]   then it's the time to hire a professional
[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:30.200]   to help you discover what things you might be skilled at.
[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:31.400]   And I'm not that professional.
[00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:32.760]   I wish I were, but I'm not.
[00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:35.800]   And so you should take whatever you're paying me
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:38.280]   and you should save it up and go and hire
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:41.400]   some form of career counselor
[00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:44.720]   and go through that career counselor's battery of tests
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:47.240]   because somebody who is a professional in that field
[00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:49.600]   will have the insight into what can work
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:53.720]   and can provide you with more useful data.
[00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:56.400]   So I think both approaches can work well,
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:59.040]   but you've probably engaged in a lot of introspection
[00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:00.680]   'cause nothing that I've just said
[00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:02.280]   is anything you haven't heard before.
[00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:04.320]   You've done a good battery of tests
[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:05.960]   and you're still wondering this question.
[00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:08.200]   So then that's the time when you need to go and hire
[00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:09.960]   a professional career counselor
[00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:11.440]   and see what they might have to say
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:12.880]   and how they might guide you.
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:16.100]   - Thanks.
[00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:19.640]   Any advice on how to find that sort of person
[00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:22.360]   or where to look for them or that sort of thing?
[00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:24.040]   - Have you ever heard anybody,
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:26.280]   I mean, have you ever tried career counseling
[00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:30.280]   or career-oriented YouTube channels or podcasts
[00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:32.280]   or heard anybody advertising services
[00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:34.020]   through that for that venue?
[00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:36.840]   - I don't think so.
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:39.800]   I mean, not more so than what you do.
[00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:44.680]   - I would begin with a search of the podcast directories
[00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:46.480]   and I would just look around and see
[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:50.680]   what career-related podcasts are out there
[00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:52.120]   on a broad general basis.
[00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:54.520]   I'm sure that some career coach somewhere
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:57.280]   has a great podcast and I don't know what it is.
[00:33:57.280 --> 00:33:59.480]   I haven't looked for it, but I'm sure someone has it.
[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:01.240]   I would also then go to YouTube,
[00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:03.720]   which I think is in many cases more fruitful
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:07.040]   and I would search for maybe set up a new account
[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:09.160]   so that you can tweak the algorithm,
[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:11.280]   set up a standalone account,
[00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:16.280]   go and start searching for career-oriented YouTube channels
[00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:19.600]   or career counselors,
[00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:22.960]   and then let the algorithm feed you some results
[00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:24.200]   over the course of a few weeks
[00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:27.480]   so that you can kind of train it to give you the channels
[00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:29.360]   that you don't know how to search for.
[00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:31.720]   I would go and look for an association
[00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:33.960]   or organization of career counselors,
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:36.480]   a professional association of some kind.
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:39.000]   Undoubtedly, there is some form of industry
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.480]   devoted to that with some form of certification.
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:45.280]   It may be something related to guidance counselors.
[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:47.960]   So for example, you think of guidance counselors at schools
[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:50.560]   who are expected to have some exposure
[00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:51.880]   to the college environment
[00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:54.040]   as well as various career options.
[00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:56.000]   It may be something on a professional level
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.400]   or it may be some form of executive coaching.
[00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:02.480]   And so I would look for an organization
[00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:04.480]   that had some form of certification
[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:07.440]   and then look for a listed directory of people
[00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:10.920]   and try to see if there's a directory of people.
[00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:11.760]   And in something like this,
[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:15.400]   I don't think it needs to be a local or regional person.
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:18.880]   It could be a national, anywhere in the nation.
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:22.000]   But there must be some form of organization
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.400]   devoted to that.
[00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:26.120]   And that's where I would start my searches.
[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:27.160]   - Okay, makes sense.
[00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:28.000]   Thank you.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:28.840]   - My pleasure.
[00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:30.120]   That concludes our Friday Q&A show.
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:32.720]   And thank you so much for listening.
[00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:33.560]   If you'd like to join me,
[00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:34.720]   we only have two callers to call in the day,
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:35.560]   so we have plenty of time.
