[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640]   I was reading this book a while ago that was basically pushing back against the idea that
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.800]   the car industry in the fifties and sixties was just offering a very uniform product.
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.160]   And they did basically the math and the number of customization options on their car were
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.600]   like more than the atoms in the universe.
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.040]   Basically just there's so many different options.
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.180]   So like all the different permutations, you can obviously customize a house just a huge
[00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.960]   amount just by like the appliances that you have and the finishes that are in there and
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.920]   the paint colors that you choose and the fixtures and stuff like that.
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.440]   It would not really change theoretically the underlying way the building goes together.
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.920]   So I do think that that idea that the sort of fundamental demand for variety is a major
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:40.920]   obstruction.
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.160]   I feel I do not think there's a whole lot of evidence for that in the construction industry.
