[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.180]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be
[00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:09.180]   found in Paul's second epistle to Timothy in the first chapter and the
[00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:16.200]   twelfth verse. The twelfth verse in the first chapter of Paul's second epistle
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:25.460]   to Timothy. "For the witch cause I also suffer these things. Nevertheless I am
[00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:32.540]   not ashamed for I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that he is
[00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:40.000]   able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day." Now those who
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.520]   meet here regularly will know that we are looking at this text for the sixth
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:50.000]   time and it is important therefore that we should all bear in our minds the
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.840]   context. This is one of these great challenging assertions made by the great
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:03.680]   apostle in which he states his faith. He does so, you remember, in a letter written
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:10.960]   to this young minister, this disciple of his called Timothy. And he writes the
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.760]   letter because Timothy was in trouble. And Timothy was in trouble because partly
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.760]   the great apostle was in prison and he'd heard that he might be put to death at
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:25.200]   any moment. And here he was a young man with these young infant churches and he
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.320]   was wondering what was going to happen to them after this mighty man of God
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.680]   should have gone. And there were persecutions and there were enemies and
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.560]   there were people defecting and falling away. And Timothy being rather of a
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:44.160]   timorous, frightened temperament and nature was cast down. He was in real
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.680]   trouble. And the apostle writes to him because of that. He says this is all
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:56.080]   wrong. That Timothy must as it were pull himself together spiritually. And in
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.080]   doing all that the apostle writes like this. So I want to read to you again from
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:07.560]   verse 6 to verse 14. "Wherefore," he says, "I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.080]   the gift of God which is in thee by the putting on of my hands. For God hath not
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:22.080]   given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind. Be not
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.800]   thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord nor of me his prisoner. But
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.840]   be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:39.080]   who hath saved us and called us with an holy calling not according to our works
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.960]   but according to his own purpose and grace which was given us in Christ Jesus
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:49.000]   before the world began but is now made manifest by the appearing of our Savior
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.080]   Jesus Christ who hath abolished death and brought life and immortality to light
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.840]   through his gospel. Whereunto I am appointed a preacher and an apostle and
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.600]   the teacher of the Gentiles for the which cause I also suffer these things.
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:14.760]   Nevertheless I am not ashamed for I know him in whom I have believed and am
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.400]   persuaded I'm certain that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:26.840]   him against that day. Hold fast the form of sound words which thou hast heard of
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.920]   me in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. That good thing that deposit which
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:40.600]   was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us. Now the
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:47.640]   context you see is important in this way. Here's a man in prison with everything
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.960]   against him his whole life and future uncertain may be put to death I say at
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:58.080]   any moment and yet he's perfectly happy he's not ashamed he's not disappointed
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:04.360]   he's not in trouble he's not confounded quite the reverse. He can look at it all
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:10.120]   without a equanimity indeed more than that he can smile at it. Here's a man who
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.520]   cannot only live but he's ready to die he can look through death and see beyond
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.560]   it all is well with his soul he is not in trouble and he says that Timothy
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.280]   shouldn't be in trouble. And here I say is the great message of the Christian
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:31.680]   gospel. This is what the gospel is about. It is to enable men and women to live
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:38.080]   and to die like this. That's Christianity that's what it's about. It isn't some
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.080]   vague theory about government or something like that it isn't just a
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.120]   perpetual protest against atomic bombs no no it's something that enables a man
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.960]   to live his own life triumphantly and gloriously to face everything the last
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:58.720]   eventuality death itself the last enemy everything. Now that is essential
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:04.000]   Christianity and here the Apostle puts it in terms of his own experience. He
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:11.160]   says this is exactly my condition I'm not ashamed. I know him in whom I have
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.160]   believed and I'm persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:21.120]   unto him against that day. Now then what is the basis of this amazing triumph
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:27.480]   over life this ability to look smilingly even into the face of death. What is the
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:32.000]   secret of it? What enabled the Apostle to say these words? Well we've been looking
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.560]   into this and we've seen that it wasn't just his temperament it wasn't his
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.600]   natural nature. Thank God it isn't. The Apostle I believe was naturally a
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:47.440]   depressed kind of person but you see the gospel enables a depressed person to be
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:52.600]   triumphant full of hope and assurance. No no it wasn't that neither did he become
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:57.160]   a stoic neither did he espouse any other philosophy that has ever been offered to
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.120]   men and women to help them to live and to die. There's only one reason and he
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.800]   gives it here himself and that's what we are dealing with. The Apostle is able to
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:12.840]   write like this simply and solely because he has believed the gospel which
[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:17.840]   he preached himself. The gospel of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. There's no
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:27.000]   other explanation. His whole position is based upon belief in this gospel and
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.640]   that in other words is the message of the gospel. That if we are to know its
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:38.800]   blessings we must believe its truth. The gospel has got nothing to give to people
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:43.120]   who don't believe it. You can't come and just take what you want out of this
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:47.640]   gospel it's impossible. You may think you've got it but you haven't. The
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:52.760]   blessings of the gospel are only given to those who believe the gospel.
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:56.480]   Therefore the most important thing for us in this life is to know what this
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:02.280]   gospel is that we may believe it. And as I've been indicating there's no trouble
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:06.240]   about that. Oh I know that if you read a lot of what's being said at the present
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.480]   time you might very well come to the conclusion that you can never be sure
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:13.480]   what the gospel is. That it's something that changes in every age and every
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:18.360]   century. And that because we are living in this marvelous 20th century which has
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:23.000]   split the atom, the scientific age that the world has never known before, we need
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:33.080]   a new gospel. That is the final folly. No no there's only one gospel and it's the
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:36.920]   old gospel that was preached by this apostle. It's this thing that he tells
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:41.320]   Timothy to hold fast to hold fast to the form of sound words which thou hast heard
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:46.600]   of me. I have no gospel apart from the gospel of Paul, the gospel of all the
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:54.720]   Apostles, the gospel of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. It's the only gospel
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:58.760]   today as it's always been the only gospel. There'll never be another gospel.
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:05.360]   The Apostle in the next chapter calls it my gospel. It is. It's the only one. And as
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:09.400]   he says to the Galatians, though we are an angel from heaven preach any other
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:14.520]   gospel unto you than that which we have preached let him be accursed. Let the
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:19.680]   clever men of the 20th century try to produce their new gospels. They won't
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:23.280]   help anybody. They don't help themselves. They don't know where they are. They're
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:29.120]   utterly confused and they confuse others and it isn't a gospel. It's a lie.
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:34.440]   Man doesn't discover the gospel. He receives it and he receives it as a
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:40.800]   pauper in utter helplessness. Here it is the form of sound words this deposit that
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:45.960]   the Apostle speaks about. And thank God he puts it here before us. There's no
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:53.200]   need to be in any trouble as to what the gospel is. It's this. What? Well it starts
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:58.880]   you see with God. And that's where it's different from everything offered to
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:05.360]   mankind tonight. All the false Gospels always start with men. Men's the
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:10.840]   beginning. Men's the center. Men's everything. This gospel starts always
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:19.240]   with God. "Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:23.200]   prisoner, but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:29.160]   the power of God, who hath saved us and called us with an holy calling, not
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:39.080]   according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which he was
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:46.240]   given us in Christ Jesus before the world began." Now there is the essence of
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:50.200]   the beginning of the gospel. You don't start with men. You see it's so foolish
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:56.240]   to start with men. What is men? What is this world? Is there any sense or reason
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:03.000]   in it? What is it? Well there's only one answer. God. There is. There is a purpose
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.200]   to life. There's a purpose to the whole world. And God is at the back of all. God
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:13.280]   made. God created. God sustains. God's the artificer. God's the controller. God
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:20.720]   started time. God will end time. The purpose of God. You know my dear friends,
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:24.480]   when I say that, I have a feeling within me, and I always have it when I read
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:29.480]   about this purpose of God, that if I've got nothing else that's enough for me.
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:33.640]   What makes life so hopeless is when a man feels that there's nothing in it,
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:40.680]   but it's all as Shakespeare puts it, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.
[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:46.360]   That all the toil and the effort is useless. That civilizations come and go.
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:52.800]   That there's no use in anything. Vanity of vanities. All is vanity. There's nothing
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:59.940]   more depressing than that. And no man can face and live life triumphantly until he
[00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:07.240]   knows that there's a purpose behind it all. And it's the purpose of God. And as I
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:12.080]   try to show you, it is God in three persons. God the Father, God the Son, God
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:17.400]   the Holy Ghost. They're all mentioned here. Purpose of God the Father, Christ,
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:26.040]   Jesus, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost. Very well. Now there is the fundamental
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:34.680]   base. And then you look at men in the light of that. And you see that according
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:41.080]   to the Apostle, man needs to be saved. What saved us? Man's got lost. He's gone
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:46.680]   astray. He needs to be found. He needs to be saved. And God, the purpose of God, is
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:52.440]   to save men. Here's the hope. Here's the thing that sustains the Apostle. And then
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:57.000]   you see he goes on to unfold that. How is this purpose of God being put into
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.160]   operation? Well he tells us here. It is essentially in this blessed person
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:08.360]   Christ Jesus. It was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began. This is a
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:12.600]   great comfort to me. You see we are advancing we think in this century and
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:17.000]   that century. And we are so much victims of the time process. And we are in the
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.200]   horrible flux of this time process. And we get caught up with it and depressed.
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:25.480]   And we don't know where we are. Oh what a blessing it is to be able to look up
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:30.320]   into God and see that before he even made the world, he had a great purpose of
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:38.080]   redemption. It's very good for our self-importance to read about the purpose
[00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:43.560]   of God before the foundation of the world. We mustn't get so excited my
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:49.280]   friends about our little day and our little problems. Look up I say and look
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:57.320]   to eternity. The blessed glorious God and his purpose. And it comes especially in
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:01.600]   Christ Jesus our Lord. It was there given us in him before the foundation of the
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:11.000]   world. But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ. Now
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   that's what we were dealing with last Sunday night. The coming into the world
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:22.360]   of the Son of God. Jesus is the Son of God. Man but God. And what has he done?
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:26.760]   He's conquered our every enemy even death. He's brought life, immortality to
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:31.640]   life. A new order of life which is eternal, which death cannot make any
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:36.640]   difference to. It's immortal, it's incorruptible, it's God's life. And we can
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:40.240]   be lifted up into that so that whatever may happen to us in this world it
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:48.560]   doesn't matter. I know him whom I have believed and I am persuaded that he is
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:54.840]   able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day, that glorious
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:58.680]   day when Christ shall come again and triumph over all his enemies and
[00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:04.640]   introduce his eternal kingdom of glory. Very well, there it is. But now it doesn't
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:13.880]   stop at that. That isn't all. The purpose is the purpose of God the Father. The Son
[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:20.520]   has appeared and has done his work in this world to make this purpose actual and
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:25.840]   real. And he's done it all. He's gone back and he's seated at the right hand of God
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:34.400]   in the glory everlasting. But that isn't the end. There's something further. How
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:38.360]   does all this come to us? That's the question. How did it come to the Apostle?
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:43.160]   How does it come to anybody? How did it come to Timothy? Well now, this
[00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:47.640]   section you see answers that question very perfectly. There is still one other
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:52.920]   big event that we've got to look at. Now the point I'm trying to stress and to
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:15:02.720]   underline is this. That the Christian salvation is based upon history. This is
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:06.800]   a fundamental point and so many go astray at the present time here. We are
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:10.200]   so accustomed to philosophy, so accustomed to ideas, so accustomed to
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:15.600]   thoughts. We want some saving idea, we say. We want some thought into which we can
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:25.700]   hitch ourselves. Now that's not Christianity. Christianity is God putting
[00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:31.720]   his purpose into operation. God visiting and redeeming his people. That's it. It
[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:35.240]   was given to Zacharias, the father of John the Baptist, who announced it. God
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:41.640]   hath visited and redeemed his people. The Bible is the book of the acts of God.
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:49.920]   And all our salvation depends upon not ideas but actions which God has taken in
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:55.320]   this world of time. That's why we can be so sure of it, you see. Ideas come and go.
[00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:59.040]   They're found to be wrong and you need new ones. Here are historic events and
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:02.640]   I've been reminding you of some of them. How God made the world, the history of
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:07.080]   the Jews, God's interventions, God bringing them out of captivity, sending
[00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:10.760]   them into another, bringing them back and so on. And now in the fullness of the
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:14.240]   time, he sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law. And the
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:20.080]   phenomenon, the fact of history, Jesus of Nazareth, son of God, and the resurrection,
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:26.920]   a fact. Not an idea but it's a fact. That's why we are given those details
[00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:30.720]   about his appearances and the different people who saw him. The Apostle Paul
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:34.840]   gives a list of them in 1 Corinthians 15, how he was seen by certain chosen
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:38.840]   witnesses and so on. All these are facts. Now then, that brings us to this next fact.
[00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:46.480]   What's that? Well, we are meeting together tonight on Whitsunday evening. What is
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:52.920]   this Whitsunday? Well, this is the day, isn't it, the anniversary of that tremendous
[00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:57.640]   event which took place at Jerusalem. The account of which I read to you at the
[00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:02.640]   beginning out of the second chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:09.640]   These men in Jerusalem were amazed. They said, "Look at these men, they're all
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:13.600]   Galileans, but we are hearing them all speaking in our own languages and
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:19.120]   telling us what? The wonderful works of God. What are the wonderful works of God?
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:22.600]   The things I've just been telling you about. And here's the last of them, the
[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:28.280]   day of Pentecost. What's the day of Pentecost? What happened? Here were these
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:32.240]   men met in an upper room. They'd been meeting like that for ten days and they
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:36.160]   were praying as they'd been praying and waiting. Suddenly there was a sound of a
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:44.320]   mighty rushing wind. And all the rest that followed. What is this? Oh, my dear
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:48.880]   friends, this is the coming of the Holy Ghost, the third person in the Blessed
[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:55.320]   Holy Trinity upon the infant church. What for? Oh, he's come to further the purpose
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:18:03.360]   of God. This purpose planned before the world. The Son comes and does his work,
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:09.160]   the Spirit is sent to continue it. These are the facts. Now then, I want to hold
[00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:13.280]   this great and mighty fact before you tonight. And this is as much a fact as
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:18.600]   the birth of Jesus. It's as much effect as his death upon the cross. It's as much
[00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:24.280]   effect as his glorious resurrection. It's as much effect as his ascension, the
[00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:29.600]   coming of the Holy Ghost upon that company of people and the wonderful
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:34.280]   things that happened. It's a phenomenon. It's a fact of history. It's the
[00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:40.720]   beginning of something absolutely new. And of course that was how the people
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:44.040]   reacted to it in Jerusalem and everywhere else. They were confronted by
[00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:49.440]   a phenomenon. You see, here are these men, these apostles, these men, Peter and
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:52.920]   others. What were they? Well, they were very ordinary men. They were ignorant and
[00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:57.440]   unlearned men. Peter was a fisherman, others were fishermen, and others had
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:01.600]   other menial tasks to perform. These men had never been trained. They were not men
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:05.240]   of brilliant understanding and philosophical insight. They were most
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:09.600]   ordinary men, ordinary workmen, and everybody knew them. But suddenly they
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:14.280]   see these men speaking unknown languages and speaking with authority and filled
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:17.920]   with a spirit of glory and of exultation. And they came crowding and said, "What is
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:27.960]   this? A phenomenon." Now this, you see, is a part of this great purpose of God. The
[00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:32.120]   change in these men and their preaching and the power that was given to them to
[00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:37.680]   work miracles, to do astounding things. So, you see, this message spread and people
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:41.640]   heard of it and people believed it and people became members of this infant
[00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:46.440]   church, this Christian church, and on it spread. And this man Paul, who was then
[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:50.760]   Saul of Tarsus, he heard about it and he didn't like it and he opposed it and he
[00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:55.320]   was miserable while he did so. But now he's preaching it. Why? Well, what is this?
[00:19:55.320 --> 00:20:02.240]   And here he reminds Timothy of what it is. What is the meaning of that which
[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:07.240]   happened at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost? What's the meaning of this
[00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:11.800]   descent of the early ghost upon the Christian church? I say there's only one
[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:19.200]   answer. It is God's purpose being carried on. The Spirit has been sent to further
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:24.120]   the purpose, to apply it, to extend it, to see that it is continued and that it'll
[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:32.440]   go on working until it is finally complete. Now it is because of this, you
[00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:39.320]   see, that the Apostle is able to write as he writes. And no man will ever have this
[00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:44.280]   view of life and of death and this triumphant type of living as an
[00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:49.160]   experience until he believes all these facts. Now let's look at it. What's the
[00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:57.080]   meaning of Pentecost? Well, I don't want to keep you tonight with purely doctrinal
[00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:01.480]   or theological reasons and yet they're important, you see, how important it is
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:05.880]   the fact of what happened on the day of Pentecost is a fulfillment and a
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:12.200]   verification of the promises of God. God in the Old Testament had promised that
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:15.920]   he was going to pour forth his Spirit. Peter tells them that in his sermon on
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:21.640]   the day of Pentecost at Jerusalem. But you see the significance. The whole of
[00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:28.800]   the Christian position depends upon this. The purpose of God. That purpose that was
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:33.760]   planned, as I remind you, before the foundation of the world. So God, knowing
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:38.520]   the plan and the purpose, he now and again let out, as it were, bits of
[00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:43.120]   information. He gave previews of what he was going to do. He foretold what he was
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:47.040]   going to do. He did it centuries before it happened. He foretold the coming of
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:51.760]   his Son and it all was fulfilled. He also foretold the coming of the Spirit and on
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:58.260]   the day of Pentecost that was fulfilled. So you see I have a verification of the
[00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:03.840]   purpose of God. I can believe in the purpose of God more surely because I've
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:08.360]   got not known only the Word of God but I've got the fact that the Spirit came
[00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:12.320]   and that men and women were astounded in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost and
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:17.240]   were amazed by this phenomenon. I see the whole of the Christian Church coming out
[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:23.560]   of it and I can only explain the Church in one way, that it is the purpose of God.
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:29.140]   If the Church were merely a human institution of the Church of men she'd
[00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:34.820]   have ended long ago but she isn't. She is the purpose of God. And so the day of
[00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:39.980]   Pentecost is a verification of the promises of God and that in turn is a
[00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:47.260]   proof of the purpose of God. But then it has a second purpose and that is this,
[00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:52.860]   that it is also a proof with regard to the person of our blessed Lord and
[00:22:52.860 --> 00:23:01.580]   Savior Jesus Christ. He says he's the Son of God. Is he the Son of God? Well as I
[00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:04.860]   was showing you the resurrection is enough to prove that but here's a
[00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:11.660]   further proof. He said to those crestfallen and happy disciples, "Let not
[00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:15.660]   your heart be troubled. You believe in God, believe also in me." Then he went on to
[00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:22.360]   say, "I will not leave you orphans, I will not leave you comfortless. I will send the
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:26.920]   Holy Spirit unto you." He said, "It is expedient for you that I go away for if I
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:31.120]   go not away the Comforter will not come unto you but if I go away I will send
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:36.760]   him unto you." He committed himself. He said in effect something like this. He
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:42.160]   said, "Now then I leave myself in your hands in this way. I'm going, I'm going to be
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:46.720]   crucified, I'm going to be taken from you but don't be unhappy. I'm going but you'll
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:55.540]   not be left alone. I will send the Holy Spirit unto you." And if the Holy Spirit
[00:23:55.540 --> 00:24:00.940]   hadn't descended on the day of Pentecost you would have a right to say that he is
[00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:05.980]   not the Son of God and that he is not the Messiah. But the coming of the Holy
[00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:13.260]   Ghost proves it. He promised. The promise is fulfilled. He is the Son of God. I will
[00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:18.540]   send him another Comforter. So you have God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy
[00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:25.740]   Spirit and each one verifies as it were the word of the other. But the thing I
[00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:33.420]   want to emphasize most of all tonight is this, that the coming of the Holy Spirit
[00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:42.220]   is this absolute proof that God is going to carry on his work. The Holy Spirit has
[00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:46.780]   been sent into the Church, the Holy Spirit is in the Church, the Holy Spirit
[00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:51.940]   is the third person in the Blessed Holy Trinity and he's going on with the work
[00:24:51.940 --> 00:25:00.700]   until it shall be completed. Here is our comfort and consolation. I read my
[00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:04.380]   newspapers, I listen to the television and the wireless, I hear the news, I
[00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:08.140]   listen to the speeches of the statesmen, I see their conferences, they're coming
[00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:11.260]   and going and they're planning and what they're proposing to do about the world.
[00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:15.540]   All right, it's got to be done, but I don't pin my faith in that. I know it's
[00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:19.380]   going to let me down, it's always let us down. The world is not better, it's worse.
[00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:25.220]   But I look at this and I see the purpose of God and I see these great mountain
[00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:30.180]   peaks of history and I know that it's through God's fulfilling his word, he's
[00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:33.620]   carrying out his promise. The coming of the Holy Spirit is one of these
[00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:44.940]   wonderful works of God. And how does the Holy Spirit further this work? How does
[00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:49.860]   the Holy Spirit further this purpose of God? Well now then, the Apostle puts it
[00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:59.540]   here in one word. How can I get this view of life? We, none of us, have got
[00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:05.700]   it by nature. We all of us instinctively are afraid of life, we are still more
[00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:13.820]   afraid of death. We are afraid of that unknown eternity. How can I get this? How
[00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:18.900]   can all this become living and real and vital to me? There's only one answer, it
[00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:27.020]   is the work of the Holy Spirit. What does he do? He calls us. Listen. "He, not thou
[00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:31.300]   therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner, but be
[00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:36.180]   thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God who
[00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:46.220]   hath saved us and called us with an holy calling." Here it is. Did you notice the
[00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:50.460]   words that were uttered by Peter there at the end of that sermon on the day of
[00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:55.340]   Pentecost? He said, "The promise is unto you and to your children and to all that
[00:26:55.340 --> 00:27:05.820]   are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call, call. He's saved us and
[00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:14.060]   he's called us with an holy calling." What does this mean? Ah, this is how all that
[00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:18.260]   God has planned and purposed is applied to me and becomes relevant in my life
[00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:22.660]   and enables me to speak as the Apostle Paul speaks. It's only the man who's
[00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:27.100]   been called who can do this. What's it mean? Well, it means that this is God's
[00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:31.660]   way of bringing us to see the truth of the message, the truth concerning his
[00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:38.740]   eternal purpose. Now let's look at this work of the Holy Spirit. What does he do?
[00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:45.500]   Well, I say he calls us. Where does he call us from? Where are we? We need to be
[00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:50.700]   called. But why do we need to be called? Well, we need to be called because of the
[00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:55.980]   place and the condition in which we are by nature. Where are we? And the Bible is
[00:27:55.980 --> 00:28:00.460]   full of answers to that question. Let me give it to you in perhaps its most
[00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:08.140]   succinct form as it's found in a word by the Apostle Peter. "You," he said to the
[00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:13.260]   Christian people who'd come into the church from Judaism and from Gentilism,
[00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:18.020]   "you are a chosen generation and royal priesthood and holy nation a peculiar
[00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:25.420]   people that he should show forth the praises of him who has called you out of
[00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:34.140]   darkness into his marvelous light." He's called us out of darkness. What does this
[00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:39.660]   mean? Ah, my dear friends, this is the most relevant and urgent matter today. Why are
[00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:43.980]   men and women defeated by life? Why are men and women unhappy? Why are they afraid
[00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:47.780]   of tomorrow? Why are they afraid of death? Why is there all this uncertainty?
[00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:52.300]   Why is it that so few can face life and death and all things like the Apostle
[00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:59.300]   did? The answer is that they're in darkness. He's called us out of darkness.
[00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:04.940]   What does this mean? Well, let the Scripture expand itself. We are all by
[00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:13.660]   nature in darkness and there's darkness in us. Life is as it is and the world is
[00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:20.740]   as it is tonight because all mankind is in darkness. We are all born dead in
[00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:27.660]   trespasses and sins. We are dead. That's our whole trouble. What does this mean?
[00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:34.860]   Well, it means that we are dead to the life of God. Is your life determined and
[00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:41.020]   controlled tonight by the fact that you believe in the purpose of God? Do you
[00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:45.540]   think that's true of the majority of people today? Think of the teeming messes
[00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:50.100]   lying on the beach in Brighton and other places today. Is there any thought of God
[00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:57.140]   in them? Is their life based upon God? What foundation have they got to their
[00:29:57.140 --> 00:30:01.140]   lives? And the answer is that God doesn't enter in at all. He doesn't enter into
[00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:05.820]   any of their calculations. They start with men, they end with men, they start
[00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:10.900]   with this world, they end with this world. They're dead. Dead in trespasses and
[00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:16.420]   sins. They're living as if there were no God, no purpose, no nothing beyond man.
[00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:20.940]   They don't know about God. They're spiritually dead. They don't know they've
[00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:28.140]   got a soul within them. They don't know anything of the spiritual realm. Sea, sand,
[00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:34.180]   pleasures, drink, gambling, sex, money, motor cars, that's life to them. They've
[00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:39.540]   got nothing beyond it. They don't know of any unseen spiritual realm. They don't
[00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:44.700]   know of any qualities that rise above mere human thinking. They don't know of
[00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:51.700]   influences supernatural. They cannot say even with words worth I have felt a
[00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:57.660]   presence that disturbs me with the joy of elevated thought. No, no, they're purely
[00:30:57.660 --> 00:31:03.020]   materialistic. They're this life, this world. And the result of all this, you see, is
[00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:07.100]   that they're ignorant and that they're quite thoughtless and heedless. Of course
[00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:10.340]   they're worried that there may be a war. They're frightened by the bombs and
[00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:14.540]   they're troubled when illness and accident and death come along. But these
[00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:19.300]   things are only temporary. They don't really cause them to sit down and think
[00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:24.700]   and ponder it all and meditate upon it all seriously and profoundly. They don't
[00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:28.780]   make them think and say, "Well, what's going to happen to me? What happens when I die?
[00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:33.060]   Where do I go? What am I? Where am I going? What am I meant for?" They don't face
[00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:40.780]   these things. And that is why men and women are the victims of circumstance
[00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:51.260]   and chance. The state of the stock market, the weather, and odd fortuitous things
[00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:55.020]   that tend to happen to them. These are the things that determine and control
[00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:59.740]   their lives. They have no idea of eternity. They have no idea of an ultimate
[00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:02.660]   destiny. They don't think about them. They're utterly... Why? Well, they're
[00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:06.780]   spiritually dead. They're in darkness. They're ignorant. They don't know these
[00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:11.100]   things. That was the state of the whole of paganism. It hadn't got any knowledge
[00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:18.300]   of God. It was ignorant. Their foolish minds were darkened, says Paul. And not only
[00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:23.460]   that, when they do hear of the things of God, they regard them as utter
[00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:28.620]   foolishness. They say, "Do you really mean to say that people still believe in God?
[00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:32.820]   Do you mean to say that in the mid-20th century people still believe that Jesus
[00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:37.140]   of Nazareth is the Son of God? Do you mean to say that people still believe in sin?
[00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:41.620]   This is a great joke. This is really very funny, fancy believing... Foolishness!
[00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:47.860]   Nonsense! All things long outmoded, utterly ridiculed. This is indeed incredible that
[00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:51.540]   in a scientific age people should believe in hell and in eternal punishment
[00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:56.660]   and the wrath of God. Why, they say, is it possible that anybody still... Foolishness!
[00:32:56.660 --> 00:33:02.260]   And of course the tragedy is that they think that they're in that position and
[00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:06.660]   regard all this as foolishness because they are the 20th century people, and
[00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:09.700]   because of the great advances of science and the great advance of knowledge.
[00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:13.340]   They're so ignorant that they don't know people were saying exactly the same
[00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:18.380]   things in the first century. The Apostle Paul tells us in the first
[00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:23.100]   epistle to the Corinthians, chapter 2, "The natural man receiveth not the things
[00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:27.540]   of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him; neither can he know
[00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:33.860]   them, because they are spiritually discerned." They said it all 20 centuries
[00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:40.580]   ago. Indeed I can take you further back. So the Psalmist tells us, "The fool hath said
[00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:47.100]   in his heart, 'There is no God.'" Ignorance, darkness. Now there is man by nature, and
[00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:51.220]   that's why life is such a problem. And when death comes, everything's gone. The
[00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:54.820]   foundation has been lost. We are dependent upon things and people, and
[00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:58.940]   when they're lost, we've nothing left. And then comes the fact of death, and we
[00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:01.460]   don't know what's happening, and we don't know where we are going. Ignorance,
[00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:09.060]   darkness. We need to be called out of it. And it is a part of the blessed purpose
[00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:15.860]   of God to call us out of it. And as he sent his Son into the world to work out
[00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:20.260]   a salvation whereby he could reconcile us unto himself, he has now sent his
[00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:25.940]   Spirit in order that he might call us to a realization of these things. And that's
[00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:33.900]   precisely what the Spirit began to do on the day of Pentecost. God has not only
[00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:40.100]   provided a way of salvation for us, he brings us into it. He calls us out of
[00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:46.460]   darkness into his most marvelous light. How does he do it? Well, you see, you've
[00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:49.900]   got a perfect instance of it there in what I read to you out of the second
[00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:55.980]   chapter of Acts at the beginning. Look at this man, Peter. Peter, the fisherman.
[00:34:55.980 --> 00:35:00.540]   Peter the braggart, the boastful fellow, who said to our Lord, "Though everybody
[00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:04.540]   should desert you, I'll stand by you." And then, when he stood in the court listening
[00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:07.700]   to the case and the servant girl recognized him, he said, "I don't know him."
[00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:13.500]   He denied him thrice with oaths, "The cad, the coward, to save his skin." He denies
[00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:21.820]   his greatest benefactor, his greatest friend, his Lord and Master, Peter. And
[00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:25.540]   here he is on the day of Pentecost, standing up with boldness and preaching,
[00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:32.500]   and not merely saying things, but saying them with power, and such power that they
[00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:36.540]   had a tremendous effect upon the people who were listening to him. Three thousand
[00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:42.140]   were added to the church. That's the work of the Holy Spirit. It wasn't Peter, but
[00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:46.780]   it was the Holy Spirit using Peter. It was the Holy Spirit taking hold of Peter
[00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:51.500]   and using him as a vehicle and a channel to call men and women out of darkness
[00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:56.100]   into God's marvelous light. How does he do it? Well, you see, this is the whole
[00:35:56.100 --> 00:36:00.660]   glory of it all, and that's why I can stand in this pulpit and say these
[00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:04.780]   things with confidence. You may have come into this service and you may think that
[00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:08.700]   everything I've said hitherto is rubbish and nonsense and folly, but my friend,
[00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:13.020]   there is a Spirit behind me and in me and through me that can open your eyes
[00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:17.460]   and bring this thing to you with such force that you'll cry out like these men
[00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:26.140]   did, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?" The Spirit of God is a powerful Spirit. He can
[00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:30.420]   act upon the mind, he can enlighten it, he can open it, he can give it
[00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:34.620]   understanding, he can give it an ability that it formerly lacked. It can change
[00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:39.540]   the natural man into a spiritual man who sees and understands what formerly
[00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:51.300]   ridiculed. And the way in which he does it is something like this. As we are
[00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:55.380]   listening to something that we've perhaps heard many and many a time,
[00:36:55.380 --> 00:37:02.540]   something new suddenly takes place, we begin to pay attention to these things
[00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:10.180]   in a way we've never done before. He brings the truth to us powerfully. We
[00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:14.100]   begin to listen in a way we've never listened before. We begin to see some
[00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:20.580]   sense coming into what was meaningless to us. We begin to attend unto these
[00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:27.220]   things as Lydia began to attend unto the preaching of Paul at Philippi. But still
[00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:32.780]   more important, we begin to have a personal concern. This is what the Holy
[00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:36.420]   Spirit does. A man can come and listen to the preaching of the gospel, and he can
[00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:39.660]   listen as a sermon tester, he can be interested in the man, in the preaching,
[00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:42.940]   in the words, in many another thing, he can even be interested in the argument,
[00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:47.100]   in the particular thoughts, but he's listening in a detached manner. He's
[00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:51.420]   listening as a spectator, he's listening as a judge, as he might go to a theater
[00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:56.220]   and listen to a drama, watch a play being acted. It's the same detachment, it's got
[00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:59.100]   nothing to do with him, it's a matter of interest to him, he may have that
[00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:02.940]   particular kind of taste, but it's nothing more. But now when the Spirit
[00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:07.380]   comes, a man begins to listen in a personal manner, he begins to get a
[00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:13.420]   personal concern. This is what the Spirit does. It makes these things living and
[00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:20.540]   real and practical and relevant to us. And what does he show us? Well, you see
[00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:30.660]   what the Spirit shows us, he shows us God and something of the glory of God. He
[00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:39.140]   begins to enlighten our darkness and to expose our ignorance. The man begins to
[00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:42.900]   say to himself, "I've never really thought about God, I've argued about God, I've
[00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:47.580]   delivered my opinions about God, but I've never really thought about God. What is
[00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:54.260]   God? Is God the Almighty Creator? Is God light and in him is no darkness at all?
[00:38:54.260 --> 00:39:00.020]   Is God holy and just and righteous? God!" A man begins to think about God and to
[00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:06.740]   realize that God is more important than the whole cosmos. The Spirit alone can
[00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:15.580]   bring us to that. And then he begins to show us our own sinfulness. He really
[00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:21.100]   makes a man face himself. And no man knows anything about the work of the
[00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:26.820]   Holy Spirit in calling until he knows something about a conviction of sin. Our
[00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:31.100]   Lord said that he shall convince the world of sin and of righteousness and of
[00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:37.300]   judgment, and he does. We all of us have lived a life of self-defense, self-excuse,
[00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:41.980]   self-explanation. We say, "I'm not as bad after all, I'm not a perfect saint." But that
[00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:46.140]   means that you are a very wonderful man. Rarely everybody else is wrong, but you
[00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:50.020]   are all right. You've never faced yourself, but once the Spirit begins to
[00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:54.620]   apply the truth, you face yourself and you see yourself for what you really are.
[00:39:54.620 --> 00:40:02.540]   David, you remember David. He saw that woman and he lusted after her, so he
[00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:06.060]   murdered her husband in order to get her and then committed adultery before that.
[00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:11.340]   And he was quite pleased with it all. It was very wonderful. And then the Spirit
[00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:16.620]   of God began, conviction came in. And David soon begins to see himself. He says,
[00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:25.780]   "Behold, I was born in sin, and in sin did my mother conceive me. I'm rotten, I'm vile.
[00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:31.700]   What I want is a clean heart. Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right
[00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:36.540]   spirit within me." The Apostle Paul, this very man who's writing here to Timothy,
[00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:41.320]   this man before his conversion was one of the most self-satisfied men that the
[00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:46.180]   world has ever known, a religious man, a moral man, feeling he'd kept the law of
[00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:51.420]   God and that he was saved, all was well. But then the Spirit began to call him and
[00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:55.540]   to deal with him. And this is what he says about himself, "In me, that is to say, in
[00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:59.580]   my flesh dwelleth no good thing."
[00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:10.040]   "O wretched men that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?
[00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:15.680]   All my righteousness," he says, "is but as dumb, it's refuse, it's useless, it's
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:21.240]   filthy, it's foul." He hated it. He'd seen the blackness of his own heart, the
[00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:28.080]   self-righteousness, the self-assurance, the false idea of righteousness. And here
[00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:36.880]   he sees his vileness, his impurity, his rottenness. And that is how the Spirit of
[00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:44.480]   God calls us. And then he reveals to us the fact that we all have got to die and
[00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:49.080]   after death the judgment, and we stand before God and give an account of the
[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:54.240]   life lived and the deeds done in the body. And there we've now seen the law of
[00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:59.940]   God thundering down upon us. God being what he is says, "Thou shalt love the Lord
[00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:04.880]   thy God with all thy heart and all thy soul and all thy mind and all thy
[00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:09.000]   strength. Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." And we haven't done it, nobody's
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:14.160]   done it, and we are therefore guilty. And we are vile and we are impure. We cannot
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:18.960]   dwell with that burning light. We are lost, we are damned. The wrath of God is
[00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:28.480]   upon us. And if we die like that it means that we go on to an eternity like that.
[00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:34.520]   An eternity of misery and shame, of realization of our unutterable folly, of
[00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:39.680]   our uncleanness, impurity and vileness. We realize it and then we realize that
[00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:44.080]   try as we will we can't change ourselves. Have you ever tried it? Have you tried to
[00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:47.560]   live a good life? Have you ever tried to imitate Christ? Some of the greatest men
[00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:51.200]   of the centuries have tried and they've all had to agree in the end and say this,
[00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:57.840]   "Not the labors of my hands can fulfill thy laws demands. Could my zeal now respite
[00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:07.560]   now? Could my tears forever flow? All for sin could not atone." Do your utmost and
[00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:14.120]   it's useless. We are hopeless and we are helpless. And yet we are moving forward.
[00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:18.480]   Every day brings us nearer to death and the judgment that lies beyond it. And
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:24.280]   here we are, we see ourselves. We've got to meet this Holy God. What can I do?
[00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:29.520]   There's nothing that I can do. So I cry out in my terror and in my alarm as
[00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:39.280]   these men did listening to Peter, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?" It is the
[00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:44.720]   Holy Spirit that brings a man to death. And that is how he calls men and women
[00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:50.840]   out of darkness into God's most marvelous light. He reveals the horror of
[00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:55.200]   the darkness, the hopelessness, the helplessness of the darkness. And a man
[00:43:55.200 --> 00:44:04.600]   sees it and he cries out, "What shall I do?" And then the Spirit gives the answer,
[00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:13.920]   "Repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:20.240]   you shall have remission of sins and you shall have the gift of the Holy Ghost." He
[00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:26.000]   unfolds to us, he was sent to do it, the truth about the Lord Jesus Christ, his
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:31.920]   Saviorhood, his Deity, his death on the cross, his resurrection, the whole purpose,
[00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:40.160]   God's way of salvation in Christ Jesus. He reveals to us all that he's done and all
[00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:50.360]   that he is going to do. And the moment a man sees that and believes it, everything
[00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:56.480]   is changed. He is now in the light, he's no longer in darkness. He's got a new
[00:44:56.480 --> 00:45:00.000]   view of himself, he's got a new view of life, he's got a new view of death. Why?
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:06.400]   Well, he sees it all in the light of God's great and eternal purpose. God the
[00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:11.480]   Father sends the Son, the Son does his work, goes back, the Spirit is sent, the
[00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:16.960]   Spirit is doing his work. And what is it? Oh, it's to open my eyes, to bring me to
[00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:21.760]   see what I am and my precarious position and the wonderful provision of God from
[00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:30.640]   whom has saved us. And called us with an holy calling, not according to our own
[00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:36.960]   works but according to his own purpose and grace. And a man begins to see
[00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:45.120]   himself as a pilgrim of eternity, as a child of God, knowing that he's living in
[00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:51.000]   a sinful, condemned, damned world, knowing that there is no hope for this world,
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:55.240]   there is no such thing as world reformation, it'll never come. The Bible
[00:45:55.240 --> 00:46:01.200]   says no! The world is to be judged, there'll be a new world, a new world, a new
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:06.600]   heaven and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness. And all who believe this
[00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:14.920]   message concerning him will be waiting for it and ready for it and looking for
[00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:21.640]   it. And they will spend their eternity in it. Let the world deride or pity. I will
[00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:28.200]   glory in thy shame and in thy name. I have committed unto him what my soul and
[00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:32.440]   its keeping against that day, the great day of the appearing of the Son of God,
[00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:38.720]   to judge the world in righteousness, to destroy evil and all that belongs to it,
[00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:47.000]   and set up this glorious kingdom. It was because he was certain of these things
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:54.800]   that this old apostle lying there in the prison with near a sword, as it were,
[00:46:54.800 --> 00:47:02.800]   playing above his head, is able to say, "Nevertheless, I am not ashamed. For I
[00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:08.680]   know him in whom I have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep this
[00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:14.040]   which I have committed unto him against that day." My dear friend, this is the
[00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:22.080]   question. Have you been called? "Worth called us with an holy calling." Have you
[00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:28.880]   been called? Have you been called out of darkness? Tell me, what's your view of
[00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:36.040]   life tonight? What you're basing your life on? How do you look at tomorrow? How
[00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:40.280]   do you look at next year? How do you look at the future? Have you faced death? Have
[00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:44.800]   you faced what lies beyond? Where are you? Where are you in life at this very
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:49.840]   moment? Have you got an understanding? Are you ready for all eventualities? Can you
[00:47:49.840 --> 00:48:01.320]   face the very worst and say, "Nevertheless, I'm not ashamed. I know where I am. I know
[00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:06.480]   what's going to happen to me. I'm not afraid of the present. I'm not afraid of
[00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:13.120]   the future. The terrors of law and of God with me can have nothing to do. My
[00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:21.920]   Savior's obedience and blood hide all my transgressions from view. My name from
[00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:28.240]   the palms of his hands, eternity cannot erase. Impressed on his heart, it remains
[00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:37.640]   in marks of indelible grace. Yes, I to the end shall endure, as sure as the earnest
[00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:46.240]   is given. More happy, but not more secure, the glorified spirits in heaven. Why am I
[00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:55.040]   sure of all this? Well, here it is. It is his purpose. It is the assurance of his
[00:48:55.040 --> 00:49:06.080]   purpose. Things future, nor things that are now, nor all things below, nor above,
[00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:19.560]   can make him his purpose for good. Or sever my soul from his love. Oh, a man is
[00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:25.480]   able to speak like this and to live and to die because he knows the purpose of
[00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:32.000]   God, this sure purpose that nothing will ever make God forego, the purpose planned
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:37.320]   before the world, revealed in the coming, the birth of the babe of Bethlehem, the
[00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:41.920]   man Jesus, the death, the resurrection, the ascension, the descent of the Holy
[00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:47.720]   Ghost, the purpose of God. It's certain. It's sure. The facts proclaim it, and the
[00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:55.480]   ultimate fact will be the coming again of the Son of God to wind up history, to
[00:49:55.480 --> 00:50:01.160]   judge the world in righteousness, to receive his own unto himself, and to set
[00:50:01.160 --> 00:50:06.040]   up his everlasting kingdom of glory. My dear friends, I plead with you, I ask you
[00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:12.520]   again this question. Have you been called? Had you ever realized before the meaning
[00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:18.480]   of the day of Pentecost? Tell me, is your life based on God the Father, God the
[00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:24.080]   Son, God the Holy Spirit? What does all this I've been saying tonight mean to
[00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:30.440]   you? Have you been listening with detachment, just wondering how long it
[00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:33.880]   was going to go on, hoping it was going to end soon? Or have you been hanging on
[00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:39.440]   my lips? Have you felt this is vital to my soul? I want to hear every word of
[00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:48.200]   this. I dare not live, I dare not die, unless I know. Do you know him in whom
[00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:54.080]   you have believed? Do you see the purpose of God in your life? Are you in his
[00:50:54.080 --> 00:51:03.640]   purpose? Is this the most vital thing in the whole world unto you this evening? If
[00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:11.280]   it is, well then I'm glad to tell you the Holy Spirit has done his work. He's
[00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:20.320]   called you, called you out of darkness into God's marvelous light. But my dear
[00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:24.640]   friend, if these things are not everything to you tonight, and more than
[00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:31.480]   everything, well then I tell you in the name of God you're still in the darkness.
[00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:37.600]   If the fact that the very Son of God came out of heaven and the everlasting
[00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:43.280]   glory, and lived the life of a humble man, a carpenter in this world, if the fact
[00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:47.240]   that he was born as a babe in Bethlehem in a stable and put into the manger, and
[00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:52.240]   endured all that he endured, if it means nothing to you, if he died on that cross
[00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:56.380]   and it means nothing to you, I say there's only one explanation. You are in
[00:51:56.380 --> 00:52:06.800]   gross darkness. You are dead spiritually, and the wrath of God is upon you. But
[00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:14.520]   listen, God has sent his Holy Spirit into this world, into the church that the
[00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:24.840]   world may be called out of that darkness, into his marvelous light. Have you seen
[00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:29.400]   yourself as a lost soul? Have you seen yourself for what you really are? Have
[00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:36.400]   you seen yourself in the judgment of God? Have you contemplated eternity? Listen to
[00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:44.200]   this word of God. Let these facts of history speak to you. Cry out, men and
[00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:52.680]   brethren, what shall I do? And as you do so, I reply in the words of Peter, repent
[00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:57.600]   acknowledge, confess it, give up self-defense, stop all your cleverness,
[00:52:57.600 --> 00:53:02.000]   admit you know nothing, for we don't know anything about these things by nature.
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:09.440]   Repent, believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, accept this message like a little child,
[00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:15.200]   cast yourself upon it and upon him and his love, and leave your soul, your
[00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:20.160]   eternal future in his hands. And then you'll be able to say with the Apostle, I
[00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:26.760]   am not ashamed whatever the world may do to me, because I know him whom I have
[00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:31.880]   believed, and I am certain that he is able to keep that which I have committed
[00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:44.920]   unto him against that day. Oh blessed Spirit of God, call them out! Give power
[00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:55.040]   to hear to deaf ears, and stop them. Soften hard hearts, bend stubborn wills,
[00:53:55.040 --> 00:54:06.920]   do thine own glorious work, and glorify the name of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
[00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:19.240]   The closing hymn is the hymn of men and women who've heard the call, I found a
[00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:26.720]   friend, oh such a friend, hymn number 377, I found a friend, oh such a friend, he
[00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:32.400]   loved me ere I knew him, 377.
[00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:43.400]   [organ music]
[00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:57.400]   I found a friend, oh such a friend, he loved me ere I knew him, he ruled me with
[00:54:57.400 --> 00:55:09.400]   the law of the world, and the King of kings, and the God of my heart, he ruled me
[00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:28.400]   like the rising sun and the rising moon, forever and ever, forever and ever.
[00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:41.400]   I found a friend, oh such a friend, he loved me like the rising sun and the rising moon,
[00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:52.400]   and the God of my heart, he ruled me like the rising sun and the rising moon,
[00:55:52.400 --> 00:56:03.400]   forever and ever, forever and ever.
[00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:14.400]   I found a friend, oh such a friend, he loved me like the rising sun and the rising moon,
[00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:20.400]   forever and ever.
[00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:35.400]   I found a friend, oh such a friend, oh I am through forever, now I look back to the
[00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:47.400]   sky, the world is me, I live and die, from here to the land, see the light of the world,
[00:56:47.400 --> 00:57:08.400]   the world is me, I live and die, from here to the land, see the light of the world,
[00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:12.400]   the world is me, I live and die.
[00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:19.400]   Receive, oh Lord, our unworthy praise, for the blessed assurance, the certainty,
[00:57:19.400 --> 00:57:29.400]   the safety, the security of life in Christ, and hid in him with God.
[00:57:29.400 --> 00:57:40.400]   Oh Spirit of God, call the men and women out of darkness into this marvelous light,
[00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:48.400]   and now may the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and the love of God,
[00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:54.400]   and the fellowship and the communion of the Holy Spirit, abide and continue with us,
[00:57:54.400 --> 00:58:01.400]   now this night, throughout the remainder of this hour's short and certain earthly life
[00:58:01.400 --> 00:58:07.400]   and pilgrimage, and evermore. Amen.
