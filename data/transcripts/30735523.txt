[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.760]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.460]   of the "Everyday Educator" podcast.
[00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.020]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.240]   and I'm excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.340]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.220]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.480]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.620]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.780]   this homeschooling possibility
[00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.700]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.140]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.880]   But don't forget, although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.660]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.500]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.640]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:57.100]   Well, listeners, I'm so happy to welcome you to this episode.
[00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.880]   We are gonna talk about one of my favorite things
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.260]   of all time, we're gonna talk about practicum.
[00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.560]   And I brought along a friend
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.700]   that will be familiar to many of you
[00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.340]   who also happens to love practicum
[00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.880]   and who has some special insight
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.480]   that she can share with us about this year's practicum.
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.780]   I have with me Jill Philbrick.
[00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.340]   Jill, thanks for coming back.
[00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.900]   - Absolutely, it's wonderful to be with you again.
[00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.060]   - Well, I always love our time talking together
[00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.660]   about really anything,
[00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.480]   but I especially like to talk to you about practicum
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.700]   and actually be with you at practicum
[00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.700]   because I happen to know that you really enjoy practicums.
[00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.740]   Why do you love practicum so much, Jill?
[00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.660]   - I do love practicum.
[00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.100]   I love practicum because, well, first of all,
[00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.020]   hanging around other homeschool parents
[00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.580]   is the coolest group of people on the planet.
[00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.140]   We get each other's jokes
[00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.180]   and we can celebrate with each other
[00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.560]   with the things that have gone well.
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.560]   And we sometimes share tips if something isn't going well.
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.420]   I think we sort of, well, you know, birds of a feather.
[00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.020]   So there's just wonderful, it's like being with your family.
[00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.320]   And then I also love practicum
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.720]   because I am always encouraged by the thoughts
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.420]   that go into the practicum from behind the scenes
[00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.200]   that CC, I believe, their intent has always been
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.880]   to pour into people and to pour into them academically
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.920]   with what we need for our schooling,
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.040]   but really just as people
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.580]   and as people that are made by God
[00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.640]   and to value us, to encourage us and to love us.
[00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.940]   - I love what you said.
[00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.260]   I love that.
[00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.080]   And it is true, I'll tell you,
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.000]   as somebody who works behind the scenes on practicum,
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.480]   we do think a lot about what will build up
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.960]   homeschool mom and dads as lead learners in the home.
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.080]   So we think about what can we give parents this year
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.400]   that will help them grow academically,
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.400]   but also there is a real heart in CC leadership
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.100]   for the moms and dads and their spiritual walk
[00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.980]   and their need for encouragement
[00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.580]   in the everyday journey of home education.
[00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.280]   So I appreciate you saying that
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.240]   and I'm glad that you value that.
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.580]   Let me ask you this.
[00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.860]   Did you like practicum the first time you went?
[00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.420]   - I did, but I didn't know I would.
[00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.980]   I only knew that I was going to attend.
[00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.860]   I was going to tutor for the first time
[00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.960]   and that was one of the parts of tutoring
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.500]   is it's important for you to attend practicum
[00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.940]   partly so that you're building community there
[00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.240]   with your directors and fellow parents,
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.540]   but also so that you maybe know a little bit more
[00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.040]   about what it is you're doing.
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.420]   So I did not know what to expect
[00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.800]   and I wouldn't say I was looking forward to it,
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.520]   but I loved every minute of it when I got there.
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.300]   - What was most encouraging to you?
[00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.980]   - It was so simple.
[00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.980]   It was not a whole three days or one day
[00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.240]   or hours and hours of do this, do this, do this,
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.660]   do this, do this.
[00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.020]   It was very engaging, very inviting.
[00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.820]   It helped me to think through
[00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.940]   if the speaker asked, "Well, what's a hobby you have?"
[00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.660]   Well, I could answer that.
[00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.660]   So it was just so accessible, I guess maybe is a good word.
[00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.700]   And nobody there felt, it didn't appear that they felt
[00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.660]   that there were any wrong answers,
[00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.240]   that whatever we were in our life was totally fine
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.560]   and you could enter into that conversation
[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.100]   and be encouraged and use the information that was given
[00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.660]   and find out that probably you're already doing
[00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.500]   a little of it and why that's working
[00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.880]   so that you can do it in other areas as well.
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.940]   - I really liked that.
[00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:24.700]   My experience was kind of the same.
[00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.420]   I didn't know what I was getting into.
[00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:29.020]   I really, I had never heard of practicum.
[00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.620]   That's not a word that gets thrown around
[00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.020]   in most people's circles.
[00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.340]   And so somebody invites you to go to a practicum
[00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.540]   and you think, "I don't know what that is
[00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.580]   and I don't have any frame of reference for that.
[00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:42.860]   Nothing else is like that."
[00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.220]   And I had somebody explain to me that it was a conference
[00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:50.460]   and it was kind of like a prayer meeting
[00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.460]   and kind of like a pep rally and kind of like a lecture
[00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.180]   where you found out a lot of good things,
[00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:59.500]   but it was also practical.
[00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.620]   And I could not imagine what the intersection
[00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.620]   of all that stuff was.
[00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.420]   And so the first time I ever went to a practicum,
[00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:08.580]   I found a lot of what you said,
[00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:13.060]   that there were other people who were both like me
[00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:14.860]   and not like me.
[00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.900]   And so I could learn things from them
[00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.700]   and they maybe learned things from me,
[00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.500]   but we found what we had in common
[00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.820]   and we moved together into learning things
[00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.740]   that we all were interested in knowing
[00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.220]   because we loved our children
[00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:34.540]   and we really wanted to do our very best
[00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:37.300]   in this endeavor that God had drawn us
[00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.660]   into this homeschooling.
[00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:40.140]   And so I liked that.
[00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:43.060]   It was very encouraging.
[00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.620]   So for years and years,
[00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:49.780]   I had the privilege of training practicum speakers
[00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:51.900]   and speaker trainers
[00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.900]   and working real intimately with practicum.
[00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:59.820]   And I remember year after year after year telling people
[00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:04.700]   there are three main purposes of practicum,
[00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:09.700]   to inspire, to encourage, and to equip.
[00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:12.980]   So are that, I mean, some of that,
[00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:15.460]   I mean, equipping sounds very practical.
[00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:18.860]   Like you're gonna, equipping means that I'm gonna come
[00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:21.220]   and you're gonna teach me how to do
[00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:25.220]   this big, hairy, audacious task that I've undertaken.
[00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:30.220]   But how are inspiring and encouraging practical concerns?
[00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.180]   - Well, I guess I would say
[00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:39.620]   that it's hard to live uninspired.
[00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:42.980]   It's hard to cook dinner when you don't feel inspired.
[00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:43.820]   - Yes.
[00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:48.820]   - You know, sometimes you just need some motivation,
[00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:52.620]   you know, to do the laundry and to mow the lawn
[00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:57.620]   and to wash the car, to cook the dinner,
[00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:01.820]   to sometimes to even do things you really enjoy doing.
[00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:04.620]   And if we aren't, if there isn't a little bit
[00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:09.340]   of something beautiful in it and some inspiration to it
[00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:12.220]   and sharing those things with other people,
[00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:14.860]   we can kind of get burned out.
[00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:18.940]   So I think inspiration maybe doesn't appear practical.
[00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:21.780]   Maybe we don't think of it as practical.
[00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:24.860]   But I think God would say it is practical,
[00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:29.620]   that it is important for us to be inspired
[00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:31.780]   and for us to be encouraged.
[00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:33.940]   Our children need practical encouragement.
[00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:38.300]   So encouragement itself is practical
[00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:40.260]   because of the results.
[00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:45.260]   And inspiration itself is practical because of the results.
[00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:49.260]   And we would definitely think equipping is practical,
[00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.340]   but maybe it would also be kind of fun.
[00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:54.420]   - Yeah, I agree.
[00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:58.660]   I think that it is,
[00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:02.300]   all the things that happen at Practicum to me
[00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:04.220]   are very practical
[00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:10.220]   in that we put them all into practice in our homeschooling.
[00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:15.540]   We want to inspire our children to do their best.
[00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:19.740]   We want to inspire our children to use their creativity.
[00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:23.860]   We want to inspire our children to try harder
[00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:25.860]   or to try something new.
[00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:33.060]   And all of those are practical things that happen at home.
[00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:36.900]   When we come to Practicum,
[00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:41.660]   we are inspired by people maybe who are farther along
[00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:44.100]   in the journey than we are,
[00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:47.460]   or we're inspired by somebody that we know
[00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:52.460]   had a really hard time with something.
[00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:57.260]   They had a child who really struggled to learn,
[00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:02.260]   or they had a home situation that was causing them angst
[00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:06.420]   or taking a lot of outside resources or time.
[00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:09.380]   And we are inspired when we hear
[00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:13.380]   that those people have found success,
[00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:16.660]   that they have persevered, that God has blessed them,
[00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:18.180]   that God is upholding them.
[00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:23.180]   It's inspiring to hear other people's experiences.
[00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:26.180]   And I think that's really important.
[00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:27.940]   That is very practical.
[00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:32.620]   For me, it was, I can keep going some days
[00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:35.660]   because I knew that friends of mine
[00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:38.020]   had been through similar things
[00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:40.780]   that I was feeling pulled down by
[00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:44.700]   and had persevered and come out shining on the other side.
[00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:46.740]   And that was inspiring.
[00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:48.580]   - Yes, it is inspiring.
[00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:53.580]   I agree, to know that there are people walking it with us
[00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.340]   is inspiring to know you're not alone.
[00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:00.660]   - Yes, and it's very encouraging too.
[00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:05.220]   You know, I think one of Satan's great weapons
[00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:09.740]   is he uses our failings or our perceived failings,
[00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:13.020]   things that we don't feel certain about in ourselves.
[00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:15.500]   He holds that over our heads.
[00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:19.380]   And then his second big weapon is
[00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:21.860]   that he whispers in our ears
[00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:25.340]   that we are the only ones who are experiencing that
[00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:29.020]   and that we should certainly not tell anybody about it
[00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:30.340]   because they'll look down on it.
[00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:34.900]   So he chips away at our hearts and our minds
[00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:38.460]   and he cloaks our struggle in silence.
[00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:40.780]   And so we suffer alone.
[00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:41.900]   And that's a great weapon.
[00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:44.500]   God does not want us to suffer alone.
[00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:45.740]   We come to practice Him
[00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:47.980]   so that we can encourage each other.
[00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:52.740]   And I come not to tell you how perfect my school year was,
[00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:55.700]   but to say, "Man, I never thought we would make it
[00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:57.060]   "to the end of mock trial."
[00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:59.620]   Or, "The science fair almost killed me.
[00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:01.540]   "How was your year?"
[00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:06.540]   Or, "I'm really struggling with working on Latin
[00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:08.140]   "with my child.
[00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:10.060]   "I think they need me to do the work with them
[00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:12.140]   "and I'm not sure I'm willing.
[00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:14.300]   "Help me, help me see the beauty."
[00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:19.020]   So it's very practical to receive encouragement
[00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:20.580]   from one another.
[00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:24.260]   And it's very biblical to encourage one another.
[00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.340]   And it sticks it to Satan.
[00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:30.940]   When we tell the truth about what's going on,
[00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:33.380]   we tell the truth about where we struggle
[00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:36.220]   and the truth about where God has given us triumph.
[00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:39.460]   And that is very encouraging to our communities.
[00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:42.740]   - I really like how you said
[00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:45.140]   that when we tell the truth,
[00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:48.180]   I think that's a very powerful statement.
[00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:51.660]   I believe the devil's intent is definitely to isolate us.
[00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:54.380]   So that not only to isolate us from each other,
[00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:57.460]   but then eventually to isolate us from the word.
[00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:59.500]   We might think we're pulling away from each other
[00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:01.820]   so that we can spend more time in the word,
[00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:06.820]   but really isolation, he does not have an end of that.
[00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:10.660]   He will keep pushing for further and further isolation.
[00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:12.740]   So digging in and being with each other
[00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:15.380]   and telling the truth with one another
[00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:18.180]   about ourself or sometimes about what we,
[00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:21.260]   if they say, "I don't know how to do Latin."
[00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:22.660]   And then you also said,
[00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:26.820]   the question might not really be how, but will you?
[00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:28.900]   If a parent is honest enough to say,
[00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:31.660]   "I don't know if I am willing."
[00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:33.500]   That's a very different conversation
[00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:35.100]   than I don't know how.
[00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:36.660]   - Exactly.
[00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:40.180]   And in community, we can receive encouragement
[00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:41.860]   for our own struggles,
[00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:44.380]   not just for our students' struggles.
[00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:50.340]   And nothing draws your heart closer to your community
[00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:54.820]   than being real with them and having them be real with you.
[00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:57.780]   - Yes, very true.
[00:13:57.780 --> 00:13:59.340]   That's very true.
[00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:02.500]   - Here's what I'm saying to you listeners.
[00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:07.100]   If for no other reason than community building,
[00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:10.260]   you should come to practicum every summer.
[00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:14.860]   Every summer, you need to knit your hearts together
[00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:17.780]   with the moms and dads in your community.
[00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:20.020]   We will become a whole cloth
[00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:21.660]   laid out to the glory of God
[00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:23.300]   when we knit ourselves together.
[00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:26.100]   - Yes, and a bunch of balls of yarn laid near each other
[00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:27.900]   never become fabric.
[00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:30.260]   - Yes, Jill, that's so true.
[00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:35.540]   Okay, so let's talk about really
[00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:37.620]   what happens at practicum.
[00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:42.620]   How is the learning at practicum made practical?
[00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:48.460]   What will we do as lead learners at practicum?
[00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:52.380]   And are we gonna learn more about these 15 tools
[00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:56.100]   or 15 skills that we keep talking about?
[00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:59.380]   - I would say yes, yes, and yes.
[00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:04.660]   But first of all, one of the practical pieces is,
[00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:06.380]   well, we call ourself classical.
[00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:08.220]   We're in classical stations,
[00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:11.100]   and so we think that also means we are classical.
[00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:13.420]   And sometimes we are, and sometimes we're not.
[00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:19.100]   To get another practice at using classical tools
[00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:24.100]   can remind us of what we are doing that is classical
[00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:27.220]   and what we are doing that is not classical
[00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:29.220]   and how to regroup and how to say,
[00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:32.820]   oh, I have made this harder maybe than it needs to be.
[00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:35.820]   Or maybe I have not necessarily made it harder,
[00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:38.380]   but I haven't had the conversation with my child,
[00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:43.020]   or I haven't cracked open this particular topic with them
[00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:45.420]   and just checked on it.
[00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:47.300]   There can be a lot of self-checkup,
[00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:50.700]   a little bit of a checklist maybe
[00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:54.300]   of how are things coming with me and my 15 tools?
[00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:55.820]   Am I using them?
[00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:59.220]   And I think learning to love those 15 tools
[00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:01.100]   is something that happens in community.
[00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:05.660]   We might not be completely enamored by all 15,
[00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:08.820]   but that can come, and we might have favorites.
[00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:10.540]   Like I have a favorite knife.
[00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:13.340]   Oh my, this knife can do it all.
[00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:16.540]   And if that knife is not clean, then I need to go,
[00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:18.940]   I don't even let it not get clean.
[00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:21.700]   Okay, so let me rephrase that.
[00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:24.500]   I use it, and then I immediately clean it
[00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:26.340]   because it is my favorite,
[00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:30.340]   and I'm going to need it three times for everything I make.
[00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:33.820]   So you might have a favorite whatever,
[00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:36.140]   a favorite tool of some kind,
[00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:37.300]   or you might have that,
[00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:39.580]   it could be a fashion accessory that's your favorite,
[00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:43.500]   or it could be your favorite whatever, your favorite thing.
[00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:48.260]   And those 15 tools can become our favorites, our go-tos,
[00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:50.300]   that if you were traveling and you said,
[00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:52.700]   I need to take, you're going to go camping
[00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:54.500]   and you're going to take 15 things with you
[00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:58.180]   that you know you use every day, those are your 15.
[00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:01.500]   And to practice using them together.
[00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:04.060]   And then even when we have those conversations,
[00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:06.460]   like we said earlier, sometimes we realize,
[00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:08.340]   oh, I am doing that.
[00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:11.220]   So this is, I am doing this.
[00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:13.380]   And that can be very encouraging
[00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:14.700]   to see that we are doing it.
[00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:16.780]   And then to look at how we can maybe even do that
[00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:19.860]   with more joy and being a little more intentional with it
[00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:22.340]   and to recognize, hey guys, we did it.
[00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:24.580]   We were classical today.
[00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:29.100]   - Yes, and just the practice of doing those things
[00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:31.980]   and naming it as you do it
[00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:34.100]   keeps it in the forefront of your mind.
[00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:35.860]   It occurs to me suddenly, Jill,
[00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:40.860]   that we may have a lot of new families listening today
[00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:45.380]   who have not been to practicum before
[00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:49.620]   and some who may have been only to one practicum or two.
[00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:51.300]   So we might need a refresher course.
[00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:54.820]   The 15 skills that we're talking about
[00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:59.420]   that we will use at practicum every year
[00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:03.500]   include the skills of grammar,
[00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:04.620]   which are?
[00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:07.700]   - The five core habits.
[00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:12.380]   And that would be, there's the acronym NAMES, N-A-M-E-S.
[00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:17.380]   So naming, attending, memory or memorizing,
[00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:19.820]   expressing and storytelling.
[00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:22.540]   And those tools, even though we'd already used
[00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:23.820]   some other classical tools,
[00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:25.460]   when those were introduced,
[00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:28.820]   it opened doors to me.
[00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:31.460]   Realized that those grammar tools work
[00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:35.420]   no matter if you're in a grammar stage of learning or not.
[00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:39.100]   Those are so beautiful, so brilliant,
[00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:41.380]   so inviting and hospitable.
[00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:43.340]   And it helped me fall in love with art.
[00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:46.060]   - That's very cool.
[00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:48.500]   I did not know that NAMES
[00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:51.060]   is what helped you fall in love with art.
[00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:54.220]   - And I wanna say they are super natural.
[00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:58.740]   We have spent the last week taking care of our grandson
[00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:02.580]   while our new granddaughter was born and in the hospital.
[00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:07.580]   And so we had been with Gideon, 22 months old, all week.
[00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:12.060]   And the other day, on one of our last days with him,
[00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:14.940]   my husband looked up at me and he said,
[00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:17.220]   "Oh my gosh, it just occurred to me
[00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:22.220]   how he does NAMES naturally all day long."
[00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:27.380]   He is constantly practicing the names of things
[00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:32.380]   that he knows and he is attending to everything around him
[00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:35.740]   and asking questions about it or pointing at it.
[00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:38.220]   He is memorizing because he rehearses.
[00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:39.820]   Some days he gets up in the morning
[00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:42.260]   and he just starts saying all the words that he knows.
[00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:45.740]   It's like he's going through the card catalog of his mind
[00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:48.220]   to remember all the words that he knows.
[00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:49.860]   And he likes to make sounds.
[00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:53.100]   Now he doesn't storytell yet because he's 22 months old
[00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:56.700]   and he doesn't have all the vocabulary he would need.
[00:19:56.700 --> 00:20:00.660]   But what I'm saying is that these are such natural tools
[00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:05.500]   that basically non-verbal children use them
[00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:10.500]   to become verbal and to become active learners.
[00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:13.900]   So yes, NAMES are wonderful.
[00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:17.540]   Maybe non-anything that we want to become,
[00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:21.340]   we can use these tools to become.
[00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:24.820]   Maybe non-happy, maybe non-peaceful,
[00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:29.820]   maybe non-mathy, maybe non-classical, whatever.
[00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:34.180]   We can use some tools and practice with them
[00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:38.420]   and discover the joy of that thing by naming it,
[00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:40.860]   by giving close attention to it,
[00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:45.140]   by memorizing even small parts and then recalling those
[00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:47.020]   and by finding ways to express them
[00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:49.580]   and express thanks to God for them.
[00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:51.500]   And then by telling others.
[00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:53.780]   - Yeah, yes.
[00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:58.380]   And so that's the first five skills that we talk about
[00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:01.380]   and that we will talk about at practicum this year.
[00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:05.020]   You'll get some very practical ideas
[00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:08.380]   of how to promote those 15 skills
[00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:11.420]   with all of the children and grownups
[00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:13.260]   who live at your house.
[00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:15.660]   But you'll also be introduced
[00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:18.900]   and given opportunity to practice
[00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:23.900]   with the five tools of the dialectic,
[00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:30.380]   the invention, elocution.
[00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:33.220]   No, these are the five common topics.
[00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:38.220]   So definition, comparison, relationships,
[00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:42.700]   circumstance and testimony or authority.
[00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:46.300]   And so those are five more skills.
[00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:50.220]   And then the last five skills
[00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:53.540]   are the five canons of rhetoric,
[00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:58.540]   invention, arrangement, elocution, memory and delivery.
[00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:04.980]   And so we are gonna talk about those 15 skills
[00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:08.020]   and not just talk about it,
[00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:13.020]   but actually do things to help you use those tools.
[00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:14.380]   Jill, tell us a little bit
[00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:17.300]   about how that happens at practicum.
[00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:19.340]   - Well, at practicum,
[00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:23.460]   we sometimes come with this big idea of our homeschool,
[00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:26.260]   all of our homeschool and all of our education.
[00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:28.540]   And if we narrow it down a little,
[00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:30.340]   we might narrow it down to one year.
[00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:32.980]   We might narrow it down to, or even two years,
[00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:36.100]   maybe this last year and what we think went well
[00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:39.700]   or didn't go well or what we would like to add or change.
[00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:40.940]   And then the upcoming year
[00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:43.140]   and a little about what our goals are,
[00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:44.700]   sometimes what we're excited about,
[00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:47.700]   sometimes what we're dreading, those kinds of things.
[00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:51.260]   And so the big picture is great,
[00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:55.020]   but if we can narrow it even further and say,
[00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:56.980]   okay, let's look at one subject.
[00:22:56.980 --> 00:23:01.660]   So in practicum, we will take one area
[00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:05.140]   that the classical tools can be used to explore.
[00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:09.140]   So it could be history or a Latin or science,
[00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:10.620]   lots of different areas.
[00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:12.740]   And this year happens to be math.
[00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:17.260]   So we will take math and slow our walk.
[00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:18.660]   And it occurred to me,
[00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:20.980]   as I was thinking about our upcoming call,
[00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:23.820]   that so often we hear the phrase, or in CC,
[00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:25.700]   I hear the phrase that, you know,
[00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:27.540]   we walked through that together,
[00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:30.260]   or we learned Latin together.
[00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:32.300]   And I think this is the only part of my life
[00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:34.540]   where I really hear that.
[00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:35.700]   And it occurred to me
[00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:38.540]   that that is very different than running.
[00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:41.620]   And we can run ahead of ourselves
[00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:43.860]   sometimes in our thoughts,
[00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:47.060]   and sometimes in our worries or in our enthusiasm.
[00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:49.340]   And maybe we run ahead of our children
[00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:53.660]   with where we feel like the goal is,
[00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:55.100]   but they're walking.
[00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:57.460]   And if we can walk with them,
[00:23:57.460 --> 00:24:00.180]   in fact, there is a Bible verse that says
[00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:04.780]   that God gently leads those with young.
[00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:09.140]   And when I heard that verse the first time,
[00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:13.540]   I wept because I did feel so rushed and so hurried.
[00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:16.180]   And in practicum, we are not rushing.
[00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:17.780]   We are not hurrying.
[00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:19.620]   We are gently leading.
[00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:23.140]   So we will take one thing that we can look at,
[00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:25.060]   and we can apply those classical tools.
[00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:27.900]   For instance, if we were looking at,
[00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:29.100]   well, let's just talk math,
[00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:31.220]   since that's what this theory is.
[00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:35.500]   So we might see either a definition of something in math
[00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:39.980]   or an equation or an expression in math,
[00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:41.420]   and ponder it.
[00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:43.700]   Just take a moment and realize
[00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:48.700]   that solving it quickly is not the only goal.
[00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:50.860]   'Cause we could look at three times two,
[00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:53.140]   and all of our adult brains might say,
[00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:53.980]   "Oh, that's six."
[00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:55.780]   And we want to turn the page.
[00:24:55.780 --> 00:25:00.780]   But let's apply some classical skills and some joy to it,
[00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:02.620]   and take a look at that three.
[00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:04.060]   What does three represent?
[00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:07.140]   What might our child see when they see three?
[00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:08.460]   What does that X mean?
[00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:10.580]   Are there different ways to write that?
[00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:12.420]   What does that two mean?
[00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:14.540]   What do we know about these?
[00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:16.980]   Why do we know that six,
[00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:20.500]   that three times two will be an even number?
[00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:24.100]   Why, what would we think if we saw three times three?
[00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:26.060]   What would we, what if this,
[00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:28.980]   if we can change this or look at that?
[00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:31.620]   So we're definitely using those,
[00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:33.860]   some of those 15 tools that we talked about.
[00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:36.180]   We're looking at naming the parts.
[00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:39.380]   We're looking at looking closer.
[00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:41.420]   And what did we already learn?
[00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:43.700]   And are there other ways to express this
[00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:45.460]   by changing the symbol?
[00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:47.860]   And is there a story that goes with it?
[00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:50.660]   And it could be a story of the time
[00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:53.460]   that three people each accidentally got
[00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:55.380]   two whatever's at the store,
[00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:57.300]   or it could be the story
[00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:59.940]   of how our child learned three times two,
[00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:00.900]   or things like that.
[00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:03.020]   And then with the five common topics
[00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:04.220]   and the five canons of rhetoric,
[00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:07.540]   that of course expands into deeper things
[00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:09.500]   with those numbers.
[00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:12.740]   So slowing down, looking at a thing,
[00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:14.980]   and practicing those tools for ourself
[00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:17.260]   instead of just asking our child,
[00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:19.180]   "Okay, look at this and tell me what's the same."
[00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:21.660]   And then good, check mark, move on.
[00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:23.940]   To do it and to have that conversation
[00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:25.460]   and to give ourself enough time
[00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:26.940]   to have that conversation,
[00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:29.020]   ignites some joy.
[00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:33.220]   That joy in the actual looking at one thing
[00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:35.940]   and seeing how beautiful that one thing is
[00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:37.940]   instead of trying to complete a hundred of them
[00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:39.980]   as fast as possible.
[00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:41.620]   - You know what?
[00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:45.300]   I, that was the most restful answer.
[00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:47.820]   You know, I could feel my blood pressure go,
[00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:50.060]   I can feel my heart rate slowing down.
[00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:53.620]   I absolutely love that take
[00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:55.980]   on what happens at practicum.
[00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:57.620]   Listeners, I hope that everybody
[00:26:57.620 --> 00:26:59.460]   who's been to a practicum
[00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:01.660]   will stop and think,
[00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:03.820]   that's what it's supposed to be like.
[00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:06.820]   We are supposed to slow down.
[00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:09.940]   We are, this is not a sprint.
[00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:11.460]   This is a marathon.
[00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:17.620]   The practicum time is for us to thoroughly enjoy
[00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:21.820]   and to consider and slowly is actually better.
[00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:22.700]   I love that.
[00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:25.940]   It is an opportunity for us
[00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:29.260]   to practice slowing down ourselves
[00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:32.740]   so that we are then ready
[00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:37.100]   to be the example of slowing down with our children,
[00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:39.940]   enjoying a conversation,
[00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:43.260]   actually asking them what do they see
[00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:45.140]   and what are they thinking about
[00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:48.340]   and what else might be going on.
[00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:52.340]   That's a beautiful way to explore any concept.
[00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:56.420]   And it's a super way to explore math,
[00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:58.140]   which is like you said,
[00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:02.220]   the topic that we'll delve into more deeply
[00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:06.860]   or use as practice fodder this year.
[00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:10.100]   Now, listen, I know that this year
[00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:13.100]   is especially important for all of us.
[00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:16.820]   There are things that we glean from practicum every year,
[00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:20.900]   the community aspect and learning about these 15 skills
[00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:22.820]   we practice every year.
[00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:24.340]   But this year is different.
[00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:26.980]   Our CC leadership is so eager
[00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:31.420]   for everyone to attend practicum this year.
[00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:33.460]   And it's because we're doing math,
[00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:35.900]   but we've done math before, Jill.
[00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:38.180]   So why is it so important
[00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:40.580]   that we all come to practicum this year
[00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:42.420]   and do math together?
[00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:45.980]   - This year, there is so much excitement
[00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:49.180]   about the new math curriculum, the MathMap.
[00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:50.340]   - Yes.
[00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:52.260]   - Just the chance to share it
[00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:56.220]   and to let parents see the beauty of it,
[00:28:56.220 --> 00:29:01.220]   that it is the most inviting, hospitable,
[00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:03.060]   I've said this quite a few times,
[00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:05.460]   so maybe you've heard me say it before,
[00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:07.540]   but when I was in high school,
[00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:09.220]   I was in a Christian high school
[00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:11.820]   and what made math Christian
[00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:16.020]   was that we added disciples or multiplied fishes.
[00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:21.020]   It was not that it truly looked for God in math.
[00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:25.300]   And I think that we have done that in the past.
[00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:26.660]   We have looked for, okay,
[00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:29.900]   well, where do you find math in Bible verses
[00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:32.300]   or where, and some good things,
[00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:37.060]   or what is a tithe or how many tribes of Judah
[00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:38.980]   and how many of them all had their,
[00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:40.900]   how many baskets of manna?
[00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:45.660]   But we can go deeper into the concepts of math
[00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:48.180]   and seeing the faithfulness of God
[00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:50.540]   and the patience of God
[00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:55.540]   and inviting ourselves to a conversation,
[00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:58.060]   just saying, no, I want to come.
[00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:02.340]   I am coming to that table, Lord, because you prepared it.
[00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:04.740]   Not because I necessarily thought
[00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:07.260]   I would enjoy the table of math,
[00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:10.500]   but because I will know you more in math
[00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:15.500]   and it will help me to not drag my children
[00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:20.900]   through a hard approach to math
[00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:25.900]   or project my own math love or issues onto my children
[00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:30.860]   to have that slower conversation.
[00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:34.980]   And if I'm having a slower paced conversation
[00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:36.660]   with other parents at the table
[00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:39.140]   and I see the value of that,
[00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:42.660]   then maybe I will not rush my children.
[00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:47.180]   And when they appear to want to talk about something else,
[00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:48.780]   I can take a minute and say, you know what?
[00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:52.780]   I did that at practicum and we still gained so much.
[00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:54.860]   So maybe it isn't a stalling tactic.
[00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:59.860]   Maybe it is, but maybe this is also part of learning math.
[00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:03.380]   And knowing that it isn't about any one age,
[00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:04.700]   it's not too late,
[00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:09.700]   but it's also not too early to have conversations
[00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:12.300]   about math that point to God
[00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:14.580]   the same way we would with science.
[00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:17.900]   It seems natural for us to talk about science and God.
[00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:19.340]   Look, God made this flower.
[00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:20.180]   - Right, right.
[00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:23.660]   - But we can say, look, look at all the places
[00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:26.300]   we see threes that God made.
[00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:30.500]   Look at all the places that we see spirals.
[00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:33.980]   Look at all the places where we see straight lines.
[00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:38.420]   Look at all the places where we see hops on a number line.
[00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:40.340]   And to do that with our young children
[00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:42.300]   and to not miss those moments.
[00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:43.740]   And then obviously we can do them
[00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:45.620]   with our older children too
[00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:49.420]   and draw on the math experiences they've had up till now
[00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:53.580]   and either renew our minds with them according to the word
[00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:55.020]   and say, it might've been hard,
[00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:56.580]   but we're gonna change that.
[00:31:56.580 --> 00:32:00.060]   And now we're gonna make it God honoring.
[00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:03.420]   - Yes, I love that.
[00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:05.300]   You know what is occurring to me, Jill?
[00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:08.020]   I really wanna talk to you
[00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:10.900]   even more about this practicum.
[00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:13.060]   I hope that listeners that we've given you
[00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:16.420]   something to think about for real,
[00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:20.380]   that you are really beginning to think,
[00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:23.940]   I, maybe I really do need to go to practicum this year.
[00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:25.420]   I want that community.
[00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:27.340]   I do wanna practice those tools,
[00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:29.700]   but man, they're talking about things
[00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:32.700]   like having conversations and slowing down.
[00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:34.460]   And this really appeals to me,
[00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:36.980]   but math does not really appeal to me.
[00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:38.860]   So I'm still sort of on the fence.
[00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:40.780]   I wanna ask you Jill to come back
[00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:42.580]   and do another episode with me
[00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:47.220]   because I really want us to dive deeper into the math map
[00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:49.540]   and what we're gonna specifically do
[00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:51.700]   because I know there are a host of people out there
[00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:54.220]   who are thinking, yeah, well, here's the deal.
[00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:56.780]   My kids are not having to do the math map yet.
[00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:59.420]   And so I don't really need to do this,
[00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:01.380]   get familiar with the math map yet.
[00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:02.660]   I could just wait.
[00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:04.060]   I don't want you listeners.
[00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:05.140]   I don't want you to do that.
[00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:08.260]   And I think Jill can help you to understand why,
[00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:10.620]   but it's gonna take us a little bit longer.
[00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:13.900]   So Jill, I wanna close with,
[00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:15.860]   and I wanna ask you if you'll come back
[00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:19.340]   and talk to me about the math map
[00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:21.740]   and the math map practicum,
[00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:24.140]   which is what we'll be doing this summer.
[00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:25.700]   Will you talk to me in depth
[00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:27.780]   about that a little bit more next time?
[00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:30.020]   - Of course, I'm always happy to.
[00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:35.020]   But I also want you to give a testimony
[00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:39.060]   because I do feel like there are some people
[00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:41.340]   who are thinking, yeah, well,
[00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:43.620]   I don't have to know that math map stuff yet.
[00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:46.220]   And so I'm not sure this is my year.
[00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:52.940]   You've worked a lot with the rollout of the math map
[00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:55.700]   and the pilot groups and stuff.
[00:33:55.980 --> 00:34:00.980]   And you do have a testimony
[00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:03.260]   of what the math map has done for you.
[00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:06.900]   So I'd like to end this podcast with that testimony,
[00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:10.620]   and then we'll pick back up with more math map specifics
[00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:13.300]   on the next episode when we talk a little bit more
[00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:15.340]   about practicum specifics.
[00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:18.620]   - Sure.
[00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:23.620]   So when I had the opportunity to join in as a pilot tutor,
[00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:27.660]   the first thing that happened was a math camp.
[00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:31.300]   And so I went to the math map group
[00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:33.660]   and several of us were together.
[00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:36.900]   And we were given some of the booklets
[00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:39.240]   and they were in their much earlier stages.
[00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:42.300]   And some of them were, they were different domains,
[00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:43.580]   which is something you'll learn about.
[00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:46.140]   Basically, that's just the numbers,
[00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:48.900]   a word to describe the kinds of numbers you might be using.
[00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:50.700]   You might be using single digit numbers
[00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:54.260]   or fractions or percents, which would be decimals
[00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:58.220]   or some big, crazy, complicated looking stuff
[00:34:58.220 --> 00:35:00.920]   you either never saw or haven't seen in a long time.
[00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:04.420]   Yes, there were a variety of these booklets
[00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:05.700]   in these different domains.
[00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:08.740]   And we had the chance to just take the book
[00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:11.420]   and go look at it and work through
[00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:14.620]   with no person teaching us.
[00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:16.620]   Just look at it and see.
[00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:20.140]   And there were so many discoveries that I made,
[00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:24.180]   even things that either I had done lots of times before,
[00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:27.780]   like what I would have considered simple addition.
[00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:32.700]   I discovered things about myself, about God,
[00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:37.060]   about areas I need to develop my character.
[00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:40.100]   I discovered things that I could rejoice in
[00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:41.740]   and have aha moments.
[00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:44.740]   And then in the things that I either had never seen
[00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:49.160]   or had not seen in a long time, the same thing happened.
[00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:52.460]   Just taking the time to slowly look, to compare,
[00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:55.400]   to not have to keep up with a video
[00:35:55.400 --> 00:36:00.340]   or keep up with an expert, but to learn for myself.
[00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:05.060]   So in the actual calculations part of math,
[00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:10.060]   I grew so much and found that I needed more vocabulary,
[00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:12.140]   found where my vocabulary was weak,
[00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:13.820]   where my vocabulary was strong.
[00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:16.580]   But the biggest thing I learned about my vocabulary
[00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:20.540]   is I had let some words in that were holding me back.
[00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:25.020]   Yes, they were my own words, like easy and hard.
[00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:26.340]   - Aha.
[00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:28.500]   - Yes, it was like life-changing.
[00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:31.300]   And on day one, one of the things,
[00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:33.100]   and I'm sure all of us sitting in the room,
[00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:35.540]   we might've said, "Oh yeah, that was really hard for me."
[00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:37.900]   And I don't know if they had it in their notes
[00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:42.340]   or if hearing us so often use the words easy and hard,
[00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:46.740]   brought it out, but they would say, no, how about this?
[00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:49.620]   How about instead of saying it hard or easy,
[00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:52.380]   calling it hard or easy, how about say,
[00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:56.540]   that's unfamiliar to me, or that is familiar to me.
[00:36:56.540 --> 00:37:00.660]   And it took all the self-evaluation out of it.
[00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:06.900]   And it really was such a breakthrough moment
[00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:11.580]   to not have to say that's hard for me or that's easy for me,
[00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:16.460]   because now you're putting yourself on some sort of scale
[00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:18.460]   with every other person in the room.
[00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:22.100]   If you say it's hard and someone else says it's easy,
[00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:24.180]   now you're comparing like, I don't know,
[00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:26.300]   your IQ or something, which is not.
[00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:27.940]   - Right, right.
[00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:29.340]   - It's your experience.
[00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:31.580]   Have you done this before or have you done it
[00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:33.620]   in recent times?
[00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:36.220]   And it's such an approachable way
[00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:37.740]   to handle things in community.
[00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:41.620]   I think that will change the culture of our CC groups
[00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:46.620]   in every, not just math, to instead of assessing something
[00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:50.300]   as hard or easy, which then makes it an assessment on us,
[00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:53.860]   to make it an assessment of familiar or unfamiliar.
[00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:55.900]   And then we just know whether we need to start
[00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:58.820]   with vocabulary or if we feel like we have
[00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:01.140]   the vocabulary we need.
[00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:03.380]   And that's what happened to me with art,
[00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:06.180]   with the names, the five core habits.
[00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:09.700]   And I learned that in math,
[00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:14.700]   I don't have to be a calculations expert to love math.
[00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:19.780]   And to be a math person and to get all the math jokes,
[00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:22.900]   or if I don't get it, it's okay for me to go look it up
[00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:24.780]   and say, okay, I see people laughing at that.
[00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:26.860]   Now, I wanna know why that is funny.
[00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:31.620]   And I genuinely believe I am a math person.
[00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:33.820]   I do not believe that I have
[00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:36.180]   the strongest calculation skills.
[00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:40.980]   I still would not say that I remember every formula
[00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:42.780]   well enough to do it without my charts,
[00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:46.980]   without going, but I am perfectly comfortable now
[00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:50.340]   being a person who goes back and checks for what I need.
[00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:52.020]   We do that with the Bible.
[00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:52.860]   Nobody-
[00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:53.700]   - Absolutely.
[00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:54.540]   - Right.
[00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:56.540]   Nobody says, well, I guess I must not be a Christian
[00:38:56.540 --> 00:38:59.740]   since I don't remember Leviticus 4.2.
[00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:00.580]   - Right.
[00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:01.420]   - I mean-
[00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:02.260]   - Absolutely.
[00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:04.140]   - You just get your Bible out and you look it up.
[00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:07.780]   You use your concordance or you even Google it,
[00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:11.260]   but you just go get what you need
[00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:14.180]   and refresh yourself or learn.
[00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:17.380]   And that happened to me in math.
[00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:19.980]   And so now I don't feel like I have to pass
[00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:24.260]   some sort of test to call myself a math person.
[00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:27.220]   I don't feel like I have to qualify myself
[00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:31.380]   with anybody else to love learning math.
[00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:34.460]   And I don't feel like I have to go to the far ends
[00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:38.300]   of anything and get it right the first time
[00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:41.100]   to still enjoy the math lesson.
[00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:41.940]   - Wow.
[00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:44.300]   That is a huge encouragement.
[00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:48.340]   Listeners, I hope that's probably reason enough
[00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:52.020]   for you to come to the MathMap Practicum this summer,
[00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:56.340]   even if your child is not going into Challenge A
[00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:59.380]   and using it in community this year.
[00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:02.380]   But we are gonna dive even more deeply
[00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:06.420]   into what we're gonna do with the MathMap
[00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:09.940]   and Practicum this year on the next episode
[00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:11.420]   of "The Everyday Educator."
[00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:15.620]   Jill, I appreciate you for inspiring
[00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:19.220]   and encouraging and equipping us today.
[00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:22.100]   And I look forward to what you're gonna tell us next time.
[00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:23.380]   - That sounds wonderful.
[00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:24.660]   Thank you for having me.

[00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:29.260]   And listeners, I have one more thing
[00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:31.380]   that I think could benefit you.
[00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:35.740]   That's another experience coming up for you in May.
[00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:39.340]   Our annual National Events Weekend
