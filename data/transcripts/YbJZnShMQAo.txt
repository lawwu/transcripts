[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320]   I hate affirmative action.
[00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:03.480]   I don't just disagree with it.
[00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.360]   I don't just think it's against the 14th Amendment.
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.920]   I hate it.
[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.880]   The hatred comes from an understanding
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.400]   that it is a band-aid, that it is a substitute
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.760]   for the actual development of the capacities
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.520]   of our people to compete.
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.160]   They want to tell African-Americans,
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.400]   "Pat us on the head.
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.140]   "We're gonna have a separate program for you.
[00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.000]   "We're gonna give you a side door that you can come into."
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.280]   That doesn't make us any smarter.
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.120]   It doesn't make us any more creative.
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.040]   And it doesn't make us any more fit
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.360]   for the actual competition that's unfolding before us.
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.120]   - The following is a conversation with Glenn Lowry,
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.220]   professor of economics and social sciences
[00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.520]   at Brown University.
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.580]   He is one of the great minds and communicators of our time,
[00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.500]   writing and speaking about race and inequality.
[00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.320]   I highly encourage you to listen to his show
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.960]   on YouTube and Substack, simply called "The Glenn Show."
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.880]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.

[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.040]   in the description.
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.360]   And now, dear friends, here's Glenn Lowry.
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.940]   Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech,
[00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.440]   I think is the greatest speech in American history.
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.760]   If I may, I'd like to read a few words of it.
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:18.600]   - Sure.
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.120]   - And ask you a question about this dream.
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.200]   "I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.900]   "and live out the true meaning of its creed.
[00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.540]   "We hold these truths to be self-evident,
[00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.480]   "that all men are created equal.
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.860]   "I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia,
[00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.640]   "the sons of former slaves
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.960]   "and the sons of former slave owners
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.540]   "will be able to sit down together
[00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.000]   "at the table of brotherhood.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.760]   "I have a dream that one day, even the state of Mississippi,
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.080]   "a state sweltering with the heat of injustice,
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.520]   "sweltering with the heat of oppression,
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.760]   "will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.240]   "I have a dream that my four little children
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.440]   "will one day live in a nation
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.700]   "where they will not be judged by the color of their skin,
[00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.460]   "but by the content of their character.
[00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.720]   "I have a dream today."
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.360]   First of all, damn, I mentioned to you offline,
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.560]   I immigrated to America,
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.920]   and this is why I love this country.
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.280]   This is one of the great speeches
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.040]   that represents what this country is about.
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.360]   So what is this ideal of equality
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.320]   that we should strive for as a nation,
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.420]   that all men are created equal?
[00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.680]   What does that mean to you, this equality?
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.780]   - Well, if we put this in historical context,
[00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.240]   King is speaking in 1963 when he gives that speech.
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.240]   It's exactly 100 years after Abraham Lincoln
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.560]   signs the Emancipation Proclamation,
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.560]   declaring the enslaved people to be free.
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.920]   They're not yet citizens in 1863,
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.440]   but the end of slavery has become the position
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.580]   of the federal government
[00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.360]   when Lincoln issues that Emancipation Proclamation.
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.840]   So putting it in context,
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.040]   enslaved people, 4 million or so
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.220]   African-descended enslaved people,
[00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.320]   how do they become citizens?
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.320]   How do they become in this status of subjugation
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:42.200]   and domination and stigma and exclusion?
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.320]   How do they become citizens?
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.800]   It seems to me that that's the heart of it.
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.080]   The equality that King is talking about
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:58.080]   is an equality of status as members of the nation,
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.560]   as free and equal citizens within the republic.
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.480]   Now, I think it's really important to understand
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.480]   that slavery was not merely a legal order,
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:18.280]   but it was also a social system
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.800]   that had the symbolism attached to it.
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.600]   They had a big journey to make
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.400]   from their subjugated status as serfs,
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.040]   as landless people, as uneducated,
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.640]   unfit for citizenship, really, in the minds of many.
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:40.640]   So I think that's what, in 1963, 100 years later,
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.240]   that King is appealing to,
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.360]   this idea that when Thomas Jefferson,
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.160]   in the Declaration of Independence, writes these words,
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.000]   all men are created equal and endowed by their creator
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.980]   with certain inalienable rights,
[00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:03.040]   he didn't, Thomas Jefferson, a slave owner,
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.440]   didn't have in mind when he wrote those words
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.180]   the people who were slaves.
[00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.360]   But by the time you get to 1963,
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.640]   King is invoking this idea,
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.520]   all men, and of course he means all persons,
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.240]   he doesn't only mean men,
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.480]   he means men and women are created equal,
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:30.840]   he wants this idea to be embraced by the country
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.040]   in reference to the descendants of the African slaves.
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.160]   That's his dream, that's his idea.
[00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.980]   The legacy of slavery would be erased,
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:45.260]   that the position of African Americans
[00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.000]   would be equalized within the political community,
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.760]   which is the United States of America.
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.720]   That's my sense of it, in any case.
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.560]   - So on a very basic level,
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.160]   the worth of a human being is equal.
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.620]   It's just literally the worth of a human being.
[00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:03.920]   So I mentioned to you offline
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.800]   that I came from the Soviet Union.
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.080]   My grandfather fought in World War II,
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.300]   and for Hitler,
[00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:18.900]   the worth of a Slavic person as they were captured,
[00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.100]   there's different numbers,
[00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.000]   but it's in the hundreds to one German
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   in terms of the value of the person to the great Germany.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.040]   So he wanted Germany to expand
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.440]   and conquer a large part of the world,
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.680]   and within that future world, that Third Reich,
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.880]   the worth of a Russian or a Slavic person
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:45.940]   is one hundredth or one thousandth of a German person,
[00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:47.680]   of a pure German person.
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.140]   So that has to do with not some kind of public policy
[00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:53.420]   or politics or all that kind of stuff.
[00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:56.480]   It has to do with the basic worth of a human being,
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.760]   and that's what Dr. King is speaking to,
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:03.560]   that all people on some kind of deep level
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.600]   are worth the same.
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:10.800]   If you're somehow weighing the value of a person,
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.760]   we're equal in that basic fundamental worth.
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.480]   - Yeah, I think that's correct.
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.480]   I think that's very well said.
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.000]   I don't know that he had in mind
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.640]   the position of Slavic people in Central Europe
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.280]   in the middle of the 20th century
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.440]   or the first part of the 20th century.
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.400]   King, I don't know that he had that in mind.
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.440]   He might well have done,
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.120]   but certainly that's the idea.
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.960]   - So you don't think he was really thinking
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:40.440]   about this particular civil rights struggle
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.800]   and the particular struggle
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:47.840]   against the backdrop of the history of slavery in America
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.560]   and thinking about African Americans.
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:52.160]   He wasn't thinking about the basic,
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.120]   he wasn't speaking to the basic worth of all human beings.
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.840]   - No, I don't mean to say that.
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:00.320]   The speech in Washington--
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.920]   - The dream. (laughs)
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:05.200]   - In 1963 at that march
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.360]   was within the context of the United States.
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:12.320]   And it was within the context of the civil rights movement.
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.280]   There was a movement that was going on.
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:20.720]   He was an actor in a political drama that was American
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:26.360]   that had to do with the fight over equal rights
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:30.960]   for voting, for housing, for employment,
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:34.680]   for citizenship of blacks in America.
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:37.640]   But King was informed, I think,
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:41.400]   by a much broader Christian ethic
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:44.440]   of the equality of all persons.
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:47.200]   I mean, he gets killed in 1968.
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:51.520]   The five years after that speech in Washington,
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:56.520]   he spends developing his worldview
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:00.440]   and the things that he had to say,
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:03.080]   for example, about the war in Southeast Asia
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.920]   that was going on at that time,
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:10.800]   made appeals to universal principles of equality.
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.680]   He was a pacifist to some degree.
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.600]   He was against war.
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.600]   He was a socialist to some degree.
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.920]   He might not have worn that label publicly,
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:25.000]   but he believed in a decent society
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.680]   where the poor would not go untended,
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.680]   where healthcare would be available
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.560]   to people who needed it and this kind of thing.
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:36.960]   A humanitarian who saw that the value of a life
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:40.240]   was not dependent upon the color of the skin,
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:43.800]   upon the native mother tongue that might be spoken,
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.840]   upon whether male or female.
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.960]   All persons are created equal.
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:54.960]   This is very much the ethic of Martin Luther King
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.800]   on my understanding.
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:01.400]   - Broadly speaking, what do you learn about human nature
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:05.320]   by looking at the history of slavery in America?
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:08.400]   - Oh my.
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.640]   - So what does that tell you about people?
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:14.140]   - Well, I think of two things right off the top of my head.
[00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:20.080]   One is about the capacity of people
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:27.480]   for looking the other way in the face of unethical
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:36.400]   and morally profoundly problematic practice.
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:39.960]   So, I mean, slavery was controversial.
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:42.640]   It was controversial going all the way back
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:44.680]   to the founding of the United States of America.
[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:47.800]   The country was founded on a compromise
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:52.560]   where half of the country thought that slavery
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:57.560]   was abhorrent and would not have had it countenanced
[00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:59.280]   in the Constitution.
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:02.120]   The other half of the country were steeped
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:07.120]   in the dependence on the labor of these African captives
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:08.760]   and their descendants.
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.440]   The economy depended upon it.
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:11.760]   They owned them as property.
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:12.760]   That was their wealth.
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:14.640]   Their wealth was invested to some degree
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:17.680]   in the value of these human beings.
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:20.440]   And in order for the United States to come together
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:24.240]   as a confederation of the several colonies,
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.960]   there had to be a compromise made.
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:30.280]   And it was made where slavery was allowed to persist
[00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:35.480]   and the people who were against it
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:38.880]   or who thought it morally problematic
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:42.100]   were able to countenance the practice
[00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:45.560]   in the Southern states where slavery flourished.
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.480]   And that went on for 75 years
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.640]   after the founding of the country
[00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:53.280]   until the crisis of the late 1850s
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.200]   that led to the Civil War
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.880]   and ultimately to the emancipation.
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:00.160]   So one thing I think about human nature
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:05.160]   from the fact of slavery is that the ability of people
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:10.640]   to live with terrible, morally questionable practices
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:14.320]   and have that as a part of their institutions.
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:19.320]   It took a movement, a massive movement of abolitionists
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:22.160]   struggling against slavery
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.400]   for the better part of a century
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:29.840]   before that practice could be eradicated.
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:34.360]   But the other thing about human nature that I see
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:39.240]   is the ability of people to sustain their humanity
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:43.360]   under the most awful oppressive conditions.
[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:49.360]   The enslaved persons, the slaves and their children,
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.480]   I mean, they were chattel,
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:55.180]   they were bought and sold like horses or cattle.
[00:12:55.180 --> 00:13:01.320]   And yet, their humanity was not destroyed by that.
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:06.920]   And they were able to sustain their dignity to some degree
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:12.680]   in such a manner that once emancipation finally did arrive,
[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:15.120]   the freedmen and women,
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:20.040]   the persons who had been enslaved and who were set free,
[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:25.040]   were able to, over the following decades,
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:32.440]   build a foundation for the development of African-Americans
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:35.640]   within the context of American society
[00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:39.400]   that eventually culminated in the Civil Rights Movement
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.880]   of the middle of the 20th century.
[00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:44.820]   And has led us into the present day.
[00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:50.720]   So, you know, human nature can count in its awful evil,
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:55.560]   but human nature can also survive
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:58.020]   in the face of terrible evil.
[00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:00.320]   That's what I take from slavery.
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:03.480]   - That survival, that flame can burn
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:07.920]   even when the world around it tries to put it out.
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:11.640]   There's still a little flame of human consciousness,
[00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:16.560]   of spirit, of culture, of whatever the hell that is
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:19.600]   that makes humans flourish and makes humans beautiful
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.040]   that lives on.
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:22.200]   - That's very well said, yeah.
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.960]   I think you put it very well.
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:28.040]   There's gotta be some poetic way of expressing that.
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:30.920]   - Leave it to the poets.
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:34.480]   What about the people that look the other way?
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:38.020]   How many people do you think, just regular people,
[00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:40.780]   knew that something is, this is wrong?
[00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:44.760]   Or do people through generations convince themselves,
[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:46.860]   most people, most regular people,
[00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:49.580]   convince themselves that there's nothing wrong?
[00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:53.640]   - Yeah.
[00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:55.740]   - I ask this question because I wonder
[00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:59.800]   what we're looking the other way on today also.
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:02.640]   Because you have to kinda,
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:05.280]   if we're, you have to ask yourself these difficult questions
[00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:10.280]   of assuming we're the same people we were back then.
[00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:14.220]   Then we can be flawed in that same kind of way.
[00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:18.500]   We can look the other way just as others have in history.
[00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:24.100]   - Yeah, and you spoke of the European context
[00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:28.820]   and of the Nazis and certainly a lot of people
[00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:31.140]   had to be looking the other way
[00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:34.820]   when the massive crimes that were committed by that regime
[00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:36.060]   were being undertaken.
[00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:39.980]   I mean, railroad cars full of human beings
[00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:41.600]   being taken off to be slaughtered
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:45.360]   or to be worked to death in labor camps
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:48.200]   or to be gassed, et cetera.
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:50.760]   A lot of people had to know about what was going on
[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:55.760]   and look the other way or enthusiastically supported
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:16:00.880]   the persecution of the Jews and the gypsies and so on.
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:05.840]   And I don't know, I wasn't around in 1840.
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:09.960]   My sense of the matter is that like many practices
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.880]   that are unjust, most people thought
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:14.040]   that's just the way it is.
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:15.720]   I mean, that's the world that they inherited.
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:20.220]   They were not moralist, they were not revolutionaries.
[00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:22.940]   They just wanted to go along.
[00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:24.640]   Some people might've been troubled by it
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:26.440]   but thought there's nothing that can be done.
[00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:28.280]   Some people might've thought, well,
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:32.760]   they're these black Africans, they're not really like us
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:35.120]   and they are lucky to be here.
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:38.440]   If they were in Africa, they'd be worse off still.
[00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:40.760]   Some people might've thought that.
[00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:42.160]   Some people might've been disturbed
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.880]   but not been able to see what it is
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:46.280]   that they could do about it.
[00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:51.400]   They might've thought, oh, this is disgusting.
[00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:56.120]   This is not something I would wanna have anything to do with
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:17:01.120]   but not knowing whether there's any practical way
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:05.480]   of opposing it, that's why you need a movement.
[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:10.480]   You need for the people who are troubled by the practice
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.940]   to know that there are others like themselves
[00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:17.560]   equally troubled and as they gather together collectively,
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:20.680]   they can exert their influence.
[00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:24.520]   I mean, debates about the wrongness of slavery,
[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:26.200]   as I say, go all the way back
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:27.740]   to the founding of the country.
[00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:30.680]   There were abolitionists and there were people
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:33.720]   who opposed the compromise that led
[00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:38.480]   to the framing documents and institutions
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:40.720]   that created the United States of America,
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:45.720]   opposed the countenancing of slavery in that situation
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:52.200]   but it took a while before that could come to a head
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:56.620]   and produce the crisis which ultimately led
[00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:59.440]   to the eradication of slavery.
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:03.440]   I would note that slavery is not unique
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:06.120]   to the United States, it's not unique
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:10.280]   to the Western hemisphere, that enslavement of people,
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:14.960]   the trafficking in human chattel is something
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:18.080]   that one sees on a global basis,
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:22.160]   one sees it going all the way back to antiquity.
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:26.820]   So we might ask, how is it that people finally came
[00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:30.040]   to turn their backs and eradicate the practice?
[00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:33.820]   That might be the thing worth really trying to understand
[00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:36.960]   because the practice itself is, you know,
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:40.520]   there's a wonderful book by the sociologist
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:45.520]   Orlando Patterson called "Slavery and Social Death"
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:51.080]   that was published in 1982, which is a comprehensive history
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:55.700]   and social analysis of the institution of slavery
[00:18:55.700 --> 00:19:00.700]   over 2,500 years, going back to the classical Greek
[00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:06.480]   and Roman civilizations, finding slavery in Africa
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:09.960]   amongst Africans, finding slavery in the Middle East,
[00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:11.760]   finding slavery in the Far East,
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:16.540]   finding slavery in South Asia, the enslavement of people,
[00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:19.600]   the practice of taking someone as a captive in war
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:22.460]   and then instead of killing them, which you could do,
[00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:27.460]   making them into your property was very, very widespread
[00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:29.520]   in human culture.
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:33.360]   So, I mean, I like to make this point sometimes
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:36.420]   when people are talking about how wrong slavery was,
[00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:38.720]   and I agree without any question
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:45.020]   that the practice was profoundly morally problematic,
[00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:50.400]   but I like to make the point that given how wrong it was,
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:55.400]   think about how impressive was the accomplishment
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:58.280]   of the eradication of slavery.
[00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:01.720]   Now, that was something, I mean, there were 600,000 dead
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:06.400]   in the war between the states, 1861 to 1865,
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:08.480]   in a country of 30 million people.
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:13.480]   That's a lot of dead people who gave their lives
[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:16.960]   not to eradicate slavery, and in every instance,
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:20.260]   probably most of them were just fighting for,
[00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:25.440]   they enlisted or were conscripted into the forces
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:27.120]   and they fought and they died,
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:30.500]   but the net effect of their having fought and died
[00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:32.920]   was to push along a process
[00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:34.840]   that led to the eradication of slavery.
[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:36.800]   That's an amazing achievement.
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:42.800]   The slaves themselves were largely uneducated
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:47.080]   and backward in their,
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.760]   of course, what else could they have been?
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:50.740]   They were kept in captivity.
[00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:55.000]   They were prevented from developing their human potential,
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.680]   and yet, after the end of slavery,
[00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:03.280]   that population, that 4 million plus African descended people
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:08.080]   became the foundation for what a century later
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:12.560]   leads to Martin Luther King standing in the Washington Mall
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:14.400]   and giving that great speech,
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:18.260]   and now here we are 150 years down the road,
[00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:21.560]   and Barack Obama is President of the United States.
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:23.240]   Now, he did not descend from slaves.
[00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:25.620]   I think we must not lose track of that,
[00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:29.280]   but he identified as an African American
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:31.720]   and was a part of the population
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:35.900]   that consisted largely of people who descended from slaves,
[00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:40.840]   and we are, we African Americans are,
[00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:42.920]   for all practical purposes,
[00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:46.680]   fully equal citizens of this great republic.
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:49.360]   That has happened within a century and a half,
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:52.160]   and I don't know that you can find any parallel
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:55.840]   to that kind of transformation in the status of people
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:22:01.760]   from human chattel to full citizens of the republic.
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:06.360]   Anywhere in human history, it's certainly worth celebrating
[00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:10.120]   the achievement of the eradication of slavery, I would say.
[00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:13.320]   And it probably started with a few people
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:18.840]   that inside their mind dared to rebel.
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:20.720]   You know, it's interesting to think about
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:22.160]   how it all started,
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:26.320]   how in the state of injustice,
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:32.800]   the revolution percolates, like where it starts.
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:35.480]   You said people that see something is wrong
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:36.500]   find each other.
[00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:42.960]   It's in the ideas of charismatic individuals
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.880]   that not only know that something is wrong,
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:49.880]   but are able to tell others about it and be convincing,
[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:54.760]   and then together gather and rise up.
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:58.320]   It's interesting to make this kind of incredible progress
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:00.440]   from slavery to where we are today,
[00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:04.300]   to live out the ideal of this all men are created equal.
[00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:07.000]   - Yeah.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:07.840]   - The power of individual,
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:10.000]   'cause I don't know what you think about it,
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.600]   but I tend to think that a few small individuals
[00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:16.360]   probably originated this.
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:18.280]   It's the power of the individual.
[00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:20.340]   'Cause sometimes we think there's injustice in the world,
[00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:22.180]   what can I possibly do?
[00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:26.400]   I tend to think one person can be the seed
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:29.200]   of starting to fix the injustice.
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.040]   - Sure.
[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:33.280]   One person here, one person there.
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:35.200]   Yeah.
[00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:38.980]   One thinks, of course, of Frederick Douglass,
[00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:43.980]   the massively significant figure who was born in slavery,
[00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:48.800]   who stole his freedom,
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:52.260]   and because he was property,
[00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:54.720]   and he decided he was not gonna be property anymore,
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:56.100]   and he took it unto himself
[00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:59.060]   to emancipate himself personally,
[00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:02.100]   and who became an educated,
[00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:04.780]   a powerfully articulate,
[00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:09.340]   massively influential person in the United States
[00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:10.780]   and in England,
[00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:16.540]   going around, presenting himself as an embodiment
[00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:21.540]   of human dignity and commitment to ideals of equality.
[00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:27.640]   And, you know, I mean, he's just one person,
[00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:30.140]   but there were others like him.
[00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:31.940]   - Just one person.
[00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:33.580]   All it takes is just one person.
[00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:34.680]   So here we are.
[00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:41.860]   On this topic of equality in the 21st century.
[00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:45.420]   So what does equality mean today?
[00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:50.420]   If you start to think about this idea of equality of outcome,
[00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:56.700]   or the injustice of inequality,
[00:24:56.700 --> 00:25:01.020]   at which point does equality of outcome is just,
[00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:02.720]   at which point is it unjust?
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:05.640]   Sort of looking at our world today,
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:07.700]   and looking at inequality,
[00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:13.820]   how do we know that some inequality is a sign of injustice,
[00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:16.540]   and some is the way of life?
[00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:19.620]   So what does equality mean when we look at the world today,
[00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:23.300]   different from Dr. King's speech of the basic humanity?
[00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:25.600]   - I don't think King's speech,
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:29.260]   I have a dream that one day my four little children
[00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:31.380]   will be judged not by the color of their skin,
[00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:33.380]   but by the content of their character,
[00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:37.420]   requires equality of outcome.
[00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:42.020]   He says his children will be judged
[00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:44.580]   by the content of their character.
[00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:46.540]   That's a conditional statement.
[00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:48.940]   That is, the judgment will depend
[00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:50.920]   upon the content of their character,
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:53.980]   not the color of their skin.
[00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:56.780]   But it doesn't follow from that,
[00:25:56.780 --> 00:26:00.580]   that the outcomes, whatever outcomes we consider,
[00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:03.080]   wealth and economic power,
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:06.880]   position within the society,
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:10.220]   representation in the various professions,
[00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:12.980]   the various measures of social achievement,
[00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:17.300]   doesn't follow from judging by the content of character,
[00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:19.020]   and not color of skin,
[00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:21.340]   that when we look at the end of the day,
[00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:22.700]   at the social outcomes,
[00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:26.100]   that they will be equal across the different groups.
[00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:29.620]   In fact, I think there's a contradiction in the idea
[00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:31.780]   that groups will be equal
[00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:33.980]   in all of the various social outcomes,
[00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:36.900]   that they will be equally successful in business,
[00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:40.700]   that they will be proportionately represented
[00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:42.180]   in the various professions,
[00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:45.700]   that they will have the same educational achievement,
[00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:49.700]   that the occupational profiles will look the same.
[00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:54.700]   If they are, in fact, distinct groups
[00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:58.880]   with their own cultural traditions and practices,
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:02.020]   with their own ideals and norms,
[00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:06.020]   various immigrant populations,
[00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:08.220]   people coming to the United States of America
[00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:10.760]   from all corners of the world,
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:14.640]   the descendants of the African slaves,
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:17.300]   the Black Americans here today,
[00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:19.260]   who are ourselves various,
[00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:21.900]   with different origins and so on,
[00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:25.300]   the different religious practices and commitments
[00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:30.300]   that Jewish or Mormon or Christian or whatever,
[00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:37.580]   however we parcel up the total population
[00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:38.740]   into the various groups,
[00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:42.780]   these groups are themselves different from one another.
[00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:45.220]   They have different norms
[00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:48.500]   within their own cultural practice.
[00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:50.580]   How would we expect if, in fact,
[00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:54.340]   we recognize that the groups are different from one another,
[00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:56.700]   that in a world that is fair,
[00:27:56.700 --> 00:28:00.000]   they would all come out equally represented
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:00.940]   in every undertaking?
[00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:03.300]   They're not equally represented,
[00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:08.300]   and that fact, I'm arguing, is in and of itself insufficient
[00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:11.340]   to justify the conclusion
[00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:15.220]   that they're not somehow being fairly treated.
[00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:18.620]   Fair treatment doesn't imply equal outcomes
[00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:21.540]   in a world in which the populations in question
[00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:24.660]   are themselves different with respect to their culture,
[00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:27.660]   their practices, their norms, their traditions,
[00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:31.380]   their beliefs, their ideals, and so on.
[00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:35.220]   The fact of those different norms, traditions, beliefs,
[00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:37.220]   cultural orientations, and ideals
[00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:40.000]   will have consequences
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.020]   in terms of their different social outcomes.
[00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:47.780]   So I just think it's a mistake that people are making
[00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:51.940]   when they think fairness of treatment
[00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:55.980]   implies equality of outcomes.
[00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:57.500]   It does not.
[00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:01.220]   Is the process by which, we're speaking now
[00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:06.300]   in the midst of the National Basketball Association's
[00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:10.460]   playoffs, I confess to being a Boston Celtics fan.
[00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:13.520]   I mean, I'm just, it's a very good team,
[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:16.020]   and I'm excited about my Celtics.
[00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:20.620]   We defeated the Brooklyn Nets.
[00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:25.420]   I mean, we defeated Kevin Durant
[00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:30.420]   and Kyrie Irving and company, okay, in a playoff series.
[00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:33.980]   We whipped them, and we're on our way
[00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:37.820]   to the Eastern Conference Finals,
[00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:39.780]   and we're on our way to the NBA Finals,
[00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:42.520]   and I'm, you know, if I were a betting man,
[00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:45.700]   I'd put down a few bucks that the Boston Celtics,
[00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:48.540]   underrated as we are, have a very good chance
[00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:50.660]   of winning the NBA Finals.
[00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:51.820]   Okay, so that's the NBA.
[00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:53.560]   That's the National Basketball Association.
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:54.400]   I'm a sports fan.
[00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:55.780]   I like basketball. - Slightly biased
[00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:57.620]   prediction, but yes.
[00:29:57.620 --> 00:29:59.620]   - Yeah, it is somewhat biased.
[00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:02.120]   All I'm saying is, if you take a look
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:04.500]   at who the star players are
[00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:06.140]   in the National Basketball Association,
[00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:09.460]   you're gonna find that there's some Eastern Europeans.
[00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:11.820]   You know, there's some really good basketball players
[00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:15.120]   coming out of Eastern Europe, you know,
[00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:17.900]   and more power to 'em, and there are a lot
[00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:19.700]   of African Americans.
[00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:20.800]   We're overrepresented.
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:24.420]   There are not that many Jews, as far as I know.
[00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:27.180]   No offense intended there, Lex, but I mean,
[00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:33.220]   the NBA is not equally representative
[00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:37.460]   of all of the different populations in the United States.
[00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:39.080]   Now, we could go into the reasons why,
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:41.380]   but I'm just saying the process
[00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:44.580]   by which you get to be playing in the NBA is fair.
[00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:47.320]   If you can play, you can get on the court.
[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:51.220]   All they're looking for is people who can play.
[00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:53.020]   I think something like that is true
[00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:56.060]   in many different venues.
[00:30:56.060 --> 00:31:01.060]   I expect, if you're a really good technical engineer,
[00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:03.180]   companies are gonna employ you,
[00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:07.300]   and if you can make money, they're gonna advance you,
[00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:12.220]   and you will be able to rise to the top of that profession.
[00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:15.380]   I expect that the people who are engaged
[00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:18.780]   in financial transactions, who are actually making bets
[00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:21.540]   on the market, by and large, are the people
[00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:24.180]   who are good at that activity,
[00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:26.180]   and if you're good at that activity in this world,
[00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:31.180]   in this modern world, you're gonna rise to the top.
[00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:37.660]   I'm not saying that there are no barriers of discrimination.
[00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:40.540]   Of course, there are, of many different sorts,
[00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:43.540]   but I'm saying that to expect that there would be,
[00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:46.260]   okay, I mean, let's look at who's actually writing code.
[00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:48.460]   Let's look at who's actually trading bonds.
[00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:52.940]   Let's look at who's actually starting businesses,
[00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:57.120]   and so on, to say that in a fair world,
[00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:59.980]   I would expect that if blacks are 10% of the population,
[00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:02.380]   they'd be 10% of every one of those things,
[00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:06.660]   is to ignore the reality that the differences
[00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:09.860]   in the culture and practices and norms
[00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:12.140]   of the various population groups will lead
[00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:14.840]   to differences in their representation
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:17.060]   amongst people who are outstanding performers
[00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:20.060]   in one or another activity.
[00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:24.060]   - How do you know if the difference in culture
[00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:26.900]   accounts for the difference in outcomes,
[00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:30.140]   or it's the existence of barriers,
[00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:32.980]   especially barriers early on in life,
[00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:35.300]   of discrimination that are racially based?
[00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:38.140]   So if you think about affirmative action,
[00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:44.860]   in which ways is affirmative action empowering?
[00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:47.480]   In which way is it limiting?
[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:50.820]   For these early development of the different groups,
[00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:53.060]   but let's just speak to African Americans.
[00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:56.260]   We should say that you went to some no-name
[00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:57.720]   Northwestern University at first,
[00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:00.420]   but then you ended up with the great University of MIT.
[00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:05.840]   So that's your, not early, but middle development.
[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:09.060]   So speaking of the development,
[00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:13.220]   the opportunities, the equality of opportunity,
[00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:15.680]   how do we know we got that equality right?
[00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:19.380]   - Yeah, I'm glad you put it like that.
[00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:20.620]   We were talking about results,
[00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:22.140]   now we're talking about opportunity.
[00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:26.940]   I was taking the position that when King says,
[00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:29.540]   I have a dream, and he envisions a world
[00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:32.280]   where his children will not be barred
[00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:34.880]   from the good things in life
[00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:36.980]   because of the color of their skin,
[00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:41.980]   we're talking about opportunity, not about results.
[00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:45.300]   But opportunity is not just something
[00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:48.640]   that depends upon what the law is
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:49.940]   and what public policies are.
[00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:54.660]   Opportunity also depends upon the social conditions
[00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:56.780]   in which people are raised.
[00:33:56.780 --> 00:33:58.260]   The social and economic conditions.
[00:33:58.260 --> 00:34:03.260]   So the child of a poor family that has no resources,
[00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:06.340]   it doesn't have the same opportunity
[00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:08.560]   as a child of a wealthy family
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:11.620]   to realize their full human potential.
[00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:14.140]   You asked me how can we tell whether or not
[00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:18.960]   a difference in outcomes is a reflection
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:22.060]   of unequal opportunity, or it's a reflection
[00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:26.640]   of differences in culture and interest and practice.
[00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:29.580]   And I don't know that there's a single answer
[00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:33.740]   to that question, but I think one wants to look at the data.
[00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:38.740]   One wants to try to measure, as a social scientist,
[00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:41.740]   I would say what you wanna do is you wanna estimate
[00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:47.220]   the significance of various factors
[00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:48.460]   for determining the outcome.
[00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:51.820]   If the outcome is how much money does a person make
[00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:53.700]   when they work in the labor market,
[00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:55.800]   so you look at their wages,
[00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:58.580]   and you think, well, that depends upon a number of things.
[00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:00.900]   It depends upon how educated they are,
[00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:02.900]   what kind of skills they have,
[00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:06.940]   what kind of work experience they have, and so on.
[00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:09.820]   And those things are all legitimate factors
[00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:13.820]   that might determine how much they end up making
[00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:15.640]   in the labor market.
[00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:19.660]   But you also wanna perhaps, controlling for those things,
[00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:23.260]   see whether or not the fact that they are black
[00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:25.700]   or they are Latino or whatever,
[00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:29.300]   the fact that they are male or that they are female,
[00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:31.900]   the fact that they do or do not speak English
[00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:34.460]   as their native language, this kind of thing,
[00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:38.680]   whether those factors also are implicated
[00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:42.340]   in determining how successful they are in the labor market.
[00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:46.380]   And if you find that, after you have controlled
[00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:51.380]   for the things that are legitimately determining success
[00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:55.180]   and failure in the labor market, like skills and education
[00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:58.620]   and experience, having controlled for those things,
[00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:01.580]   the fact that a person is black or is a woman
[00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:06.580]   or is an immigrant or is of Latino background
[00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:11.660]   also affects their earnings,
[00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:14.420]   then you might conclude that to that extent,
[00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:16.700]   they are not getting equal opportunity in the labor market,
[00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:17.760]   that kind of idea.
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:22.140]   But I wanna focus a little bit more here
[00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:23.740]   on what we mean by opportunity,
[00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:28.740]   because it's not just whether employers treat the worker
[00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:33.120]   on a fair and even basis,
[00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:36.740]   irregardless of the worker's racial or ethnic background.
[00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:39.540]   That's one opportunity issue,
[00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:43.740]   but that's at the end of the development process.
[00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:46.780]   They are now presenting themselves to the market,
[00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:50.900]   trying to find work and being employed at this or that wage.
[00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:52.760]   That's the end of the line.
[00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:54.980]   What about the developmental opportunity,
[00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:58.760]   the opportunity to acquire skills in the first place?
[00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:00.220]   That goes all the way back,
[00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:01.580]   that goes all the way back to birth.
[00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:03.480]   It even goes back to before birth.
[00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:09.280]   The mother carrying the infant in the womb,
[00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:15.300]   she has certain nutritional practices
[00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:18.340]   that she might be smoking or drinking alcohol
[00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:19.160]   or something like that.
[00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:20.820]   I'm not saying she is, I'm not saying she isn't,
[00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:22.800]   I'm just saying whether she is,
[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:27.040]   she is gonna affect the development of the fetus,
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:28.000]   the newborn.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   Now there's a question of environment.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.680]   There's a question of the development
[00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:37.800]   of their neurological potential.
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:39.280]   Do they learn how to read?
[00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:42.480]   Are they stimulated verbally?
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:44.380]   How many words have they heard spoken?
[00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:49.680]   Are they being nurtured in a home environment
[00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:52.760]   so as to maximize the possibility
[00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:55.500]   of them achieving their human potential?
[00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:57.900]   What about the peer group influences?
[00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:00.820]   What about the values and norms
[00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:04.440]   of the surrounding human communities
[00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:05.860]   in which they're embedded?
[00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:08.500]   Do they encourage the young person
[00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:13.260]   to apply themselves in a systematic way
[00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:15.860]   to their studies and to their focus
[00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:18.840]   on their acquisition of language command
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:21.420]   and of their educational potential?
[00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:25.500]   So development is not only something
[00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:29.740]   that is controlled by the society's practices,
[00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:32.240]   it's also something that is influenced
[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:36.960]   by the cultural background of the individual.
[00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:40.260]   And those things are not equal.
[00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:43.300]   Those things vary across groups
[00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:46.540]   in a very significant way.
[00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:50.220]   And that too will be a factor
[00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:53.460]   determining disparities of outcome.
[00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:56.000]   So when I see outcomes that are different,
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.740]   I see wealth holding that's different,
[00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:01.000]   I see educational achievement that's different,
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.720]   I see representation in the professional schools
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:05.020]   and law school and medical school
[00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:06.820]   that's different between groups.
[00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:09.820]   One question is, are the institutions
[00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:11.020]   treating people fairly?
[00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:12.620]   But another question is,
[00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:17.220]   do the background in social and cultural influences
[00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:20.620]   equip people in the same way?
[00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:22.420]   And we know that the answer to that,
[00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:25.820]   not in every instance do they equip people in the same way.
[00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:27.500]   And so it makes the judgment,
[00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:28.740]   the moral judgment that we make
[00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:32.580]   when we see inequality of outcome complicated.
[00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:39.060]   Inequality of outcome is a systemic factor to some degree,
[00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:43.880]   but it is also a cultural factor to some degree,
[00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:46.760]   I wanna say, and that's controversial, I know.
[00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:49.180]   A lot of people,
[00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:52.220]   they think of themselves as being progressive.
[00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:55.200]   They wanna point a finger at society
[00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:57.040]   whenever they see a disparity.
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:00.100]   But I think that that's a mistake.
[00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:05.100]   I think it misunderstands the difficulty of the problem.
[00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:08.580]   You think that if you get the right law,
[00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:11.060]   if you have the right public policy,
[00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:13.460]   if the right politicians are elected to office,
[00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:16.060]   suddenly those disparities will go away.
[00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:20.740]   And I'm here to tell you that that's a false hope.
[00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:26.160]   And moreover, it is probably the wrong goal.
[00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:28.860]   But I mean, we could go into that.
[00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:30.420]   You were talking about affirmative action,
[00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:33.500]   which is something else altogether.
[00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:35.820]   And you were talking about me and my education,
[00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:39.260]   which is also something that's a little bit different.
[00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:41.020]   And I'm happy to talk about those things.
[00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:43.160]   Northwestern University, by the way,
[00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:44.540]   was a great university.
[00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:45.380]   - I'm just joking.
[00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:48.060]   It's one of the great universities of the world, yes.
[00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:51.120]   - And I studied mathematics at Northwestern University,
[00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:53.980]   which is how I ended up at MIT in the first place.
[00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:58.060]   And I got a very good technical training in mathematics
[00:40:58.060 --> 00:41:00.020]   when I was at Northwestern, so.
[00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:03.540]   - You love both mathematics and human nature,
[00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:08.300]   and so, which is why you ended up going into economics
[00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:11.940]   at one of the great economics programs in the world at MIT
[00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:13.060]   and getting your PhD there.
[00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:16.300]   So one of the many hats you wear is that of an economist,
[00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:19.900]   which allows you to think systematically and rigorously
[00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:23.000]   about the way the world and the way humans work at scale,
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:28.700]   trying to remove the full mushy mess of humans,
[00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:32.400]   like a psychology perspective, economics allows you to do.
[00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:35.800]   - Well, economics is one of the social sciences.
[00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:39.320]   I think there's value in psychology and in sociology.
[00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:42.020]   There's a lot to know that doesn't come up
[00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:44.060]   within the study of economics.
[00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:49.060]   We study markets and the dynamics of economic development
[00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:54.240]   and trade and so on.
[00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:59.160]   But yeah, speaking personally, as I was coming along,
[00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:01.120]   I was fascinated by mathematics.
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:04.560]   I was good at it and ended up at Northwestern
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:09.560]   and took a lot of courses there in functional analysis
[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:14.480]   and logic and mathematics and dynamical systems
[00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:18.280]   and stuff that I ended up employing
[00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:20.900]   in my graduate studies in economics.
[00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:25.680]   But you're right, I was not satisfied simply
[00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:27.560]   to be proving theorems.
[00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:32.160]   I wanted to be addressing issues of social significance
[00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:37.160]   and economics, I discovered to my delight,
[00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:39.120]   was a field of study that allowed me both
[00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:44.120]   to develop rigorous analytical frameworks,
[00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:50.320]   modeling and precision of logical deduction and inference.
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:59.800]   On the one hand, satisfying my mathematical interests,
[00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:02.400]   but on the other hand, could address questions
[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:04.640]   of social significance like,
[00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:07.800]   why does racial inequality persist?
[00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:10.380]   Why are some countries prospering and growing
[00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:12.920]   and others less so?
[00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:16.040]   Why do the prices of raw materials fluctuate
[00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:19.280]   in the way that they do over time and so on and so forth?
[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:24.280]   And I ended up falling in love with the application
[00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:29.280]   of mathematical analysis to the study of social issues.
[00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:32.080]   - What to you is beautiful about mathematics,
[00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:35.600]   about mathematical puzzles, about logic,
[00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:36.800]   all those kinds of things?
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:40.200]   'Cause it's still there, the love for math
[00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:41.160]   is still there for you.
[00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:43.280]   So is there something you could speak to?
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:46.600]   What is the kernel, the flame of that love?
[00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:49.100]   - It's like magic.
[00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:52.800]   I mean, being able to prove something
[00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:56.360]   and I mean, I think of offhand,
[00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:58.960]   there's no largest prime number, okay?
[00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:02.520]   So how would somebody know that?
[00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:03.480]   Okay, what's a prime number?
[00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:05.920]   So a prime number is a number that has a whole number
[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:08.720]   that has no divisor other than one.
[00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:11.040]   There are no divisors of the number
[00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:16.040]   that makes it a prime number, like 13 or 19 or 37,
[00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:17.520]   whatever, okay?
[00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:19.560]   So they're prime numbers.
[00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:20.760]   There's no largest prime number.
[00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:22.160]   There are infinite number of prime numbers.
[00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:23.920]   There's no largest prime number, okay?
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:25.600]   That's an idea, you can get your mind around it
[00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:26.740]   in an instant.
[00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:31.700]   It doesn't take a whole lot of depth to see the question.
[00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:33.240]   There's no largest prime number.
[00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:35.480]   - I wonder if prime numbers show up in economics.
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:36.300]   I mean that--
[00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:37.720]   - Oh, they don't show up in economics,
[00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:40.320]   except in cryptography, I understand that's important.
[00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:41.160]   - Yes, yes.
[00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:44.480]   - For code, you know, in coding stuff.
[00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:45.920]   - And that shows up in economics.
[00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:49.600]   But in terms of models, probably not.
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:52.740]   So prime numbers are a little,
[00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:58.760]   you know, in abstract algebra,
[00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:00.880]   it's like they show up in all these places
[00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:04.200]   that are just like beautiful mathematical puzzles
[00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:05.960]   that don't immediately have an application,
[00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:09.040]   but somehow maybe challenge you,
[00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:11.440]   and as a result, push mathematics forward.
[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:13.200]   Like Fermat's last theorem.
[00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:15.200]   You know, as far as I know,
[00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:18.200]   no obvious real world application,
[00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:19.940]   but it has challenged mathematicians
[00:45:19.940 --> 00:45:21.080]   throughout the centuries.
[00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:21.920]   - Indeed.
[00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:27.540]   - And somehow indirectly progressed the field.
[00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:28.380]   But--
[00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:31.640]   - That the rational numbers are countable.
[00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:34.800]   They can be put in one-to-one relationship
[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:37.020]   with the integers, you know.
[00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:38.800]   But that the real numbers are not countable,
[00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:40.600]   and there's a lot more real,
[00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:41.880]   quote-unquote, more real numbers.
[00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:43.360]   These are orders of infinity.
[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:46.040]   This is Cantor, Georg Cantor,
[00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:48.880]   and all that kind of stuff.
[00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:50.840]   Or Gertl's theorem.
[00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:52.680]   I studied this as an undergraduate.
[00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:54.440]   You know, the incompleteness theorem
[00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:58.040]   that there are propositions within any logical system
[00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:02.600]   that's rich enough to accommodate arithmetic.
[00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:04.520]   There are going to be propositions
[00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:06.560]   that you can formulate that are true,
[00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:09.440]   but that you cannot prove to be true.
[00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:14.680]   So the idea that you could systematically develop
[00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:18.200]   a logical framework for mathematical inquiry
[00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:21.800]   that could demonstrate the truth or falsity
[00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:26.800]   of any proposition is not a feasible goal.
[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:30.600]   This was Hilbert's project, as I understand it,
[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:35.280]   and Gertl showed that there was no hope ever
[00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:36.120]   of being able to--
[00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:36.960]   - (laughs)
[00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:40.800]   - To demonstrate the closure of logical systems
[00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:43.880]   that were rich enough to accommodate the real numbers.
[00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:47.960]   - That gave an existential crisis to all mathematicians
[00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:50.760]   and scientists alike, and humans,
[00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:52.480]   'cause maybe you can't prove everything.
[00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:56.920]   - I remember, you know, when I was a junior college,
[00:46:56.920 --> 00:46:58.120]   a community college student
[00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:00.040]   before I transferred to Northwestern,
[00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:01.840]   and I took a calculus course,
[00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:04.520]   and it was a lot of fun.
[00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:09.400]   And it was differentiating algebraic expressions
[00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:12.760]   and integrating and using trigonometric substitutions,
[00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:16.080]   and it was a lot of simple problem solving.
[00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:17.440]   I get to Northwestern,
[00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:19.920]   I take a course in differential equations.
[00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:22.600]   And again, it was a lot of formulaic, you know,
[00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:24.640]   applying, you get a differential equation
[00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:26.240]   of this structure, like if it's linear,
[00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:29.800]   you've got exponentials, et cetera, you can solve it.
[00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:32.800]   And then I took a course that showed, you know,
[00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:35.600]   where the question was not how to solve
[00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:38.540]   any particular functional expression,
[00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:41.760]   but it was proving the existence of a solution
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:43.560]   to a differential equation,
[00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:46.560]   where it was like x dot equals f of x and t,
[00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:49.240]   and f is just some arbitrary function.
[00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:52.400]   What do I have to assume about the function f
[00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:54.680]   in order to know that there exists a solution
[00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:59.680]   to the differential equation dx dt equals f of x and t?
[00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:03.900]   And it's basically, they called it a Lipschitz condition.
[00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:08.200]   It's a condition about the bounding of the slope
[00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:11.480]   of the function f as a function of x,
[00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:15.240]   that it doesn't, that you can sort of uniformly
[00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:17.200]   bound the slope on that function,
[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:20.280]   and then you can use a iterative process
[00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:23.880]   to show that the sequence of, you know,
[00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:26.080]   partial solutions to the thing converges to something
[00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:27.160]   that's a solution to the real thing.
[00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:29.520]   Anyway, again, I'm not gonna bore you
[00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:33.000]   or pretend that I'm a mathematician, I'm not.
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:34.120]   But what I'm saying is the difference
[00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:38.600]   between a specific algebraic formula
[00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:42.520]   that you can manipulate and solve on the one hand,
[00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:45.360]   and the abstract question of whether there exists
[00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:48.040]   a solution in the general case,
[00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:53.380]   was like a huge step for me in my study of mathematics,
[00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:56.440]   and the techniques that you have to employ
[00:48:56.440 --> 00:48:59.680]   to address these larger questions and so on.
[00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:03.560]   So I, you know, when I was an undergraduate,
[00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:08.480]   I took the first year PhD sequence in math analysis
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:11.920]   at Northwestern from a brilliant mathematician
[00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:13.340]   named Avner Friedman,
[00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:16.840]   and learned about measure theory,
[00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:19.120]   and, you know, learned about
[00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:25.160]   some early functional analysis ideas.
[00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:28.360]   And when I saw that those ideas were being applied
[00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:32.080]   by advanced study in economics, I was delighted.
[00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:34.320]   I found an intellectual home.
[00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:38.800]   So one of the fascinating challenges in mathematics
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:42.320]   is to think, how can you,
[00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:44.660]   which echoes the challenge of economics,
[00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:48.480]   what are the properties of an equation
[00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:53.480]   that allow you to say something profound and say it simply?
[00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:56.040]   And so the question of economics is,
[00:49:56.040 --> 00:50:00.240]   how do you construct a model where you can generalize nicely
[00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:03.480]   and say something profound and say it simply?
[00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:05.560]   - So one of the questions,
[00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:07.720]   one of the challenges of economics
[00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:10.320]   is macro versus microeconomics.
[00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:11.160]   - Yeah.
[00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:16.160]   - Is, you know, the world is made up of individuals.
[00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:17.640]   So there's a connection to this,
[00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:21.940]   our discussion of race and discrimination and outcomes
[00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:24.240]   and all those kinds of things.
[00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:26.560]   The world is made up of individuals,
[00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:29.800]   but in order to say something general,
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:32.640]   we'll have to construct groups.
[00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:35.880]   In order to analyze the data,
[00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:37.920]   we'll have to aggregate that data somehow,
[00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:41.480]   we'll have to make an average over some set of people.
[00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:46.080]   So what are the pros and cons of looking at things
[00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:50.120]   like equality of opportunity and equality of outcome
[00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:53.600]   based on groups versus based on individuals?
[00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:57.320]   And what are the groups,
[00:50:57.320 --> 00:51:00.400]   if there's any pros to looking at groups
[00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:02.460]   that we should be looking at?
[00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:04.340]   - Okay, well, those are big questions.
[00:51:04.340 --> 00:51:06.880]   I mean, in economics, you're right.
[00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:09.120]   I mean, micro, you have an account
[00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:11.320]   of how individuals make decisions
[00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:14.520]   about spending their money on this consumption side
[00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:16.800]   and about how enterprises make decisions
[00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:20.560]   about what to produce, how much of it,
[00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:24.420]   what inputs to use, what techniques of production and so on.
[00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:27.940]   Individual firms, individual consumers,
[00:51:27.940 --> 00:51:29.120]   and then you wanna aggregate.
[00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:30.120]   So there's a theory of,
[00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:32.080]   so-called theory of general equilibrium
[00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:37.080]   where you think supply and demand in a bunch of markets,
[00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:40.900]   you think prices that move to equilibrate,
[00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:42.980]   but you recognize that the price in one market
[00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:44.800]   affects people's behavior in another,
[00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:46.980]   the markets interacting with each other.
[00:51:46.980 --> 00:51:49.100]   You realize that the behavior of one individual
[00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:53.840]   affects the supplies and available resources
[00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:55.460]   and for other individuals,
[00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:59.900]   so they're knitted together in some kind of systematic way.
[00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:04.560]   And you wanna try to demonstrate the fact
[00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:07.380]   that notwithstanding all these interdependencies,
[00:52:07.380 --> 00:52:12.080]   there exists a solution to the system of equations
[00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:13.920]   that equates demand and supply
[00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:15.260]   across all the different markets.
[00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:19.020]   This is the existence of general equilibrium.
[00:52:19.020 --> 00:52:20.780]   Then you wanna try to say something
[00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:24.480]   about the properties of an equilibrium if it exists.
[00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:25.420]   Is it efficient?
[00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:27.600]   Well, what do you mean by efficiency?
[00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:32.000]   Well, the idea of so-called Pareto efficient outcomes.
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:35.320]   These are outcomes that cannot be uniformly improved upon.
[00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:36.880]   Everybody can't be made better off
[00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:39.140]   by an alternative outcome.
[00:52:39.140 --> 00:52:41.240]   You wanna demonstrate the efficiency
[00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:43.880]   of competitive equilibrium.
[00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:45.220]   What do you mean by competition?
[00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:46.920]   You mean that people take their actions
[00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:51.760]   to do the best for themselves that they can,
[00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:54.380]   profits of firms, well-being of consumers.
[00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:57.640]   They try to do the best for themselves that they can,
[00:52:57.640 --> 00:53:01.980]   but they do so in reference to a set of prices
[00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:03.580]   that they believe they cannot control.
[00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:08.320]   That's the criterion of competitive market circumstance.
[00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:11.260]   So does a competitive equilibrium exist?
[00:53:11.260 --> 00:53:12.760]   Do there exist a set of prices
[00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:15.840]   which if everybody recognizes them as given
[00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:18.920]   and responds to those prices
[00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:20.800]   on behalf of their own interest,
[00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:24.380]   the outcome will be supply equaling demand
[00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:26.380]   in all the markets where people are interacting
[00:53:26.380 --> 00:53:27.760]   with one another.
[00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:32.020]   And that requires the use of some concepts
[00:53:32.020 --> 00:53:34.220]   in topology, fixed point theorems and whatnot
[00:53:34.220 --> 00:53:36.040]   that are familiar to mathematics.
[00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:38.260]   Not very deep mathematical results,
[00:53:38.260 --> 00:53:40.500]   but important to economics.
[00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:43.160]   That's all about general equilibrium and whatnot.
[00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:45.060]   But you ask about groups.
[00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:49.260]   - By the way, amazing whirlwind summary of all of economics,
[00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:50.680]   but yes, go ahead.
[00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:51.740]   That was great.
[00:53:51.740 --> 00:53:57.820]   Well, markets of competition, of operator efficiency,
[00:53:57.820 --> 00:53:59.060]   anyway, but yes, groups.
[00:53:59.060 --> 00:53:59.900]   - And prices.
[00:53:59.900 --> 00:54:00.740]   - And prices.
[00:54:00.740 --> 00:54:05.100]   - And by the way, there are some very beautiful
[00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:10.300]   formalizations of everything that I'm saying here.
[00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:11.700]   You end up in vector spaces,
[00:54:11.700 --> 00:54:14.980]   you end up with sets of bundles
[00:54:14.980 --> 00:54:16.500]   of consumption and production.
[00:54:16.500 --> 00:54:17.820]   You end up with convexity.
[00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:21.180]   You end up with hyperplanes, which are,
[00:54:21.180 --> 00:54:23.820]   in this finite dimensional vector space,
[00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:28.820]   which are all of the bundles that have the same value
[00:54:28.820 --> 00:54:32.500]   at a certain price, but you end up with inner products.
[00:54:32.500 --> 00:54:36.300]   It's very pretty.
[00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:38.780]   - Yeah, but you almost forget that it's just a bunch
[00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:41.320]   of humans transacting with each other,
[00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:47.060]   that markets are made up of individuals.
[00:54:47.060 --> 00:54:48.980]   - Markets are made up of individuals,
[00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:51.460]   and in order to carry out this formalization,
[00:54:51.460 --> 00:54:54.580]   you have to make assumptions about the individuals,
[00:54:54.580 --> 00:54:58.940]   and the end result is true in a formal sense,
[00:54:58.940 --> 00:55:03.140]   but may not be true as a representation of the reality,
[00:55:03.140 --> 00:55:04.580]   because it depends upon assumptions
[00:55:04.580 --> 00:55:06.600]   that themselves may not hold.
[00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:10.940]   But at least you know what it is that has to be true
[00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:15.860]   in order for your formal framework to be relevant,
[00:55:15.860 --> 00:55:18.820]   which is already a step in the right direction, I think.
[00:55:18.820 --> 00:55:22.500]   I mean, the formalization is better than the intuition,
[00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:24.700]   the armchair intuition, where we sit back
[00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:28.460]   and we don't really know exactly what we're talking about,
[00:55:28.460 --> 00:55:32.980]   because we haven't pinned it down in a precise way.
[00:55:32.980 --> 00:55:34.940]   I'm in favor of the formalization.
[00:55:34.940 --> 00:55:37.700]   People, they think, what is mathematics
[00:55:37.700 --> 00:55:39.160]   and the social sciences?
[00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:40.480]   After all, we're dealing with people.
[00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:42.160]   People are not automata.
[00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:43.580]   I agree with that.
[00:55:43.580 --> 00:55:48.240]   But the analysis of the interaction of people,
[00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:53.240]   I think, to be rigorous, requires us to be specific
[00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:55.140]   about what we're talking about, about markets,
[00:55:55.140 --> 00:55:57.900]   about consumers, about firms, about profits,
[00:55:57.900 --> 00:56:00.780]   about technology, about preferences,
[00:56:00.780 --> 00:56:04.520]   and that's the language of economics.
[00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:11.340]   But people's behavior depends upon what they seek in life,
[00:56:11.540 --> 00:56:15.100]   depends upon their goals and their objectives.
[00:56:15.100 --> 00:56:17.540]   Those things are at play.
[00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:20.420]   They can be pushed this way or that.
[00:56:20.420 --> 00:56:23.860]   So, I mean, nationalism,
[00:56:23.860 --> 00:56:25.660]   fighting and dying for your country,
[00:56:25.660 --> 00:56:31.740]   religion, sacrificing on behalf of some abstract ideal
[00:56:31.740 --> 00:56:35.660]   of the good or of what is the human situation
[00:56:35.660 --> 00:56:38.020]   and what is the meaning of life.
[00:56:38.020 --> 00:56:40.480]   Economists have to assume that these things
[00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:44.060]   are some particular thing before they can turn the crank
[00:56:44.060 --> 00:56:46.860]   on their machine to analyze the outcomes
[00:56:46.860 --> 00:56:48.700]   of human interaction.
[00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:53.700]   And yet these things, belief in my identity,
[00:56:53.700 --> 00:56:57.540]   the things that I'm willing to sacrifice and die for,
[00:56:57.540 --> 00:57:01.960]   purposes of life that I affirm and pass on to my children,
[00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:05.500]   are important preconditions for actually carrying out
[00:57:05.500 --> 00:57:07.060]   any economic analysis.
[00:57:07.060 --> 00:57:08.900]   And they are subject to manipulation
[00:57:08.900 --> 00:57:11.220]   and to change over time.
[00:57:11.220 --> 00:57:13.580]   And that's not something that economics
[00:57:13.580 --> 00:57:15.500]   has a whole lot to say about.
[00:57:15.500 --> 00:57:17.940]   - Well, is there some general things
[00:57:17.940 --> 00:57:20.000]   that are really powerful in terms of,
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:24.080]   you said nation, religion, those are groups.
[00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:24.920]   - Yeah.
[00:57:24.920 --> 00:57:26.820]   - Can you group people nicely
[00:57:26.820 --> 00:57:29.400]   in helping you understand human nature?
[00:57:29.400 --> 00:57:34.060]   So, group them into nations based on their citizenry.
[00:57:34.060 --> 00:57:35.480]   That's geography, right?
[00:57:36.700 --> 00:57:39.340]   The geographic location of your birth
[00:57:39.340 --> 00:57:44.340]   or your long-term residence, or maybe religious belief,
[00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:48.500]   what religion you have believed over time.
[00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:49.700]   Is there groups like that?
[00:57:49.700 --> 00:57:51.600]   And then race.
[00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:54.700]   Is that useful?
[00:57:54.700 --> 00:57:59.540]   What are the pros and cons of looking at outcomes
[00:57:59.540 --> 00:58:03.880]   based on these kinds of groups, race in particular?
[00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:06.120]   - (sighs)
[00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:09.080]   I think there are pros and I think there are cons.
[00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:11.840]   I mean, I am myself, Glenn Lowry,
[00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:13.380]   sits before you right now,
[00:58:13.380 --> 00:58:16.720]   a black American, an African American.
[00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:18.880]   I quote, unquote, I identify as,
[00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:21.280]   you know, that's the way they talk about it nowadays.
[00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:22.880]   I identify as a black American.
[00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:26.320]   My skin is brown, my hair is coarse,
[00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:29.400]   my nose is broad relative to the way
[00:58:29.400 --> 00:58:30.960]   other people's noses look.
[00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:32.640]   My lips are thicker.
[00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:37.640]   That's a consequence of my ancestral descent
[00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:41.680]   from the human population resident
[00:58:41.680 --> 00:58:45.580]   in the African continent in millennia past.
[00:58:45.580 --> 00:58:47.720]   My race.
[00:58:47.720 --> 00:58:50.720]   Here in the United States,
[00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:53.680]   we have various quote, unquote, races
[00:58:53.680 --> 00:58:56.760]   defined crudely in the way
[00:58:56.760 --> 00:58:58.880]   that I just tried to define myself.
[00:58:59.840 --> 00:59:02.000]   - You could say, and I think there is
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:03.500]   a very powerful argument,
[00:59:03.500 --> 00:59:07.480]   that these are superficial differences.
[00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:09.200]   I mean, really?
[00:59:09.200 --> 00:59:11.960]   Why should it matter that your eye color
[00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:16.960]   or your hair color or the shape of the bones in your face
[00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:19.220]   or the color, the tone of your skin,
[00:59:19.220 --> 00:59:21.360]   the amount of melanin, how it is that you react
[00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:25.580]   to ultraviolet radiation in terms of your skin?
[00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:30.720]   What is that to the basis of anything?
[00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:32.280]   I mean, that's arbitrary.
[00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:33.320]   That's not meaningful.
[00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:34.680]   Could there really be meaning
[00:59:34.680 --> 00:59:38.000]   in these superficial differences among human beings?
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:40.960]   Isn't that an archaic or barbaric way
[00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:42.160]   of thinking about ourselves,
[00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:46.000]   to look at each other's skin color or hair texture
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:48.540]   and then to decide, oh, that's a black
[00:59:48.540 --> 00:59:50.440]   or that's a white or that's a Latin
[00:59:50.440 --> 00:59:53.180]   or that's an Asian or that's a whatever.
[00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:57.480]   That's something that we should outgrow,
[00:59:57.480 --> 00:59:59.300]   a person might say.
[00:59:59.300 --> 01:00:03.300]   That's a relic of a kind of tribal society,
[01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:06.840]   of a kind of pre-modern society
[01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:11.320]   where we built real structure
[01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:14.840]   on the basis of such superficial difference.
[01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:16.000]   A person could say that.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:20.600]   On the other hand, I am a black American.
[01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:22.880]   I mean, that's part of my identity.
[01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:25.500]   That's part of my heritage.
[01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:29.400]   It's part of the stories that I tell myself
[01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:32.640]   about who my people are.
[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:34.240]   Why do I need a people?
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:37.320]   Why do I need a narrative of descent
[01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:42.320]   in which I affiliate with a racially defined people?
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:45.680]   Do I really need that?
[01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:48.040]   I mean, I think that's an important question.
[01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:51.080]   In fact, this is a confession,
[01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:52.360]   think of myself as black.
[01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:55.040]   I could think of myself as simply human.
[01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:58.960]   I could not identify specifically as black.
[01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:03.160]   I could say, my eyes are brown too, so what?
[01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:04.440]   I'm a brown eye.
[01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:08.240]   I mean, I'm gonna invent a group based on my eye color.
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:10.360]   I weigh 290 pounds.
[01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:12.480]   I'm gonna have a body size group.
[01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:17.400]   I'm a plus 200 and that's quote, who I am, close quote.
[01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:18.800]   I don't do that.
[01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:20.000]   I came from Chicago.
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:23.720]   Yes, I do have a certain sense of affinity with my hometown.
[01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:26.280]   I'm a Chicago born person,
[01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:29.760]   but frankly I haven't lived in Chicago since 1979.
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:32.120]   That's a long time.
[01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:37.600]   I wear my Chicago origins very, very lightly.
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:40.120]   I would not go to war with someone from Cleveland
[01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:42.960]   or St. Louis and fight to the death
[01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:46.820]   with that St. Louis person or that Cleveland person
[01:01:46.820 --> 01:01:49.680]   based upon the fact that we come from different cities.
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:52.080]   - And you have even abandoned in your heart
[01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:53.560]   the Chicago Bulls.
[01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:55.960]   - There's some Chicago that's still in me, I suppose,
[01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:57.560]   but it's not very deep.
[01:01:57.560 --> 01:02:00.360]   It's not quote, who I am anymore.
[01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:02.840]   And I'm wondering, here I'm trying to pose a question.
[01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:06.040]   Why is it that being a descendant of African slaves
[01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:06.880]   should be who I am?
[01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:08.060]   So there's some answers.
[01:02:08.060 --> 01:02:12.840]   One answer is people will look at me
[01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:15.520]   and deal with me differently based upon what they see.
[01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:19.120]   I don't have control over that.
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:22.400]   I'm going to be perceived as a member of a group
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:24.960]   whether or not I elect to affiliate myself
[01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:27.840]   with that group or not.
[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:31.640]   Therefore, I need to be mindful of the fact
[01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:36.640]   that regardless of what my internal orientation is,
[01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:40.400]   the world will perceive me in a particular way
[01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:42.480]   and will perceive me differently
[01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:44.120]   based upon the color of my skin.
[01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:46.960]   So a police officer who stops me at two o'clock
[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:49.600]   in the morning because my taillight is out
[01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:54.120]   and ask me for my automobile registration
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:57.040]   and I reach quickly to the glove compartment
[01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:00.160]   to get my registration and the police officer says,
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:01.760]   "Show me your hands."
[01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:03.880]   And I don't quite hear what he says
[01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:07.640]   or I ignore what he says as I'm getting my document
[01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:08.740]   out of my glove compartment.
[01:03:08.740 --> 01:03:11.880]   But the police officer thinks because I have not responded
[01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:13.440]   to his demand to show my hands
[01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:15.600]   that I might be reaching for a weapon.
[01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:18.400]   And the police officer sees that I'm black
[01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:22.040]   and fears that the likelihood that I might have a weapon
[01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:25.000]   is higher because in that town at that time,
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.760]   a lot of the people who get stopped with weapons
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:31.700]   in their car happen to be black and male and so on.
[01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:34.960]   And he pulls his weapon and he discharges it
[01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:37.560]   and I'm bleeding out there and I'm dead now.
[01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:40.160]   And all of that is a possibility that's very real
[01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:42.420]   and it's based upon the color of my skin.
[01:03:42.420 --> 01:03:44.940]   And therefore, when he stops me,
[01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:46.940]   I keep my hands on the steering wheel
[01:03:46.940 --> 01:03:48.980]   and I don't go to the glove compartment
[01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:52.660]   and I'm fearful of the fact that he might mistake me
[01:03:52.660 --> 01:03:54.780]   for a criminal, et cetera.
[01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:58.420]   Or I walk into a high-end store, a clothing store,
[01:03:58.420 --> 01:04:00.540]   I see you're nicely dressed there, Lex.
[01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:02.100]   I'm not, but that's okay.
[01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:04.940]   I do have some good clothes at home,
[01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:07.060]   I just didn't wear them here today.
[01:04:07.060 --> 01:04:07.900]   But you know what I mean?
[01:04:07.900 --> 01:04:11.580]   And the salesman in the clothing store,
[01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:15.940]   either treats me like an old friend
[01:04:15.940 --> 01:04:19.540]   and is warm and welcoming and what can I do for you, sir?
[01:04:19.540 --> 01:04:20.980]   And let me show you this and that
[01:04:20.980 --> 01:04:22.100]   and what are you looking for?
[01:04:22.100 --> 01:04:24.220]   And what, because he thinks I'm gonna spend $1,000 there
[01:04:24.220 --> 01:04:27.520]   that day and he gonna get a 5% commission or whatever it is.
[01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:31.240]   And he either does that or he ignores me
[01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:32.540]   and looks at me with suspicion
[01:04:32.540 --> 01:04:34.520]   and thinks I might be trying to shoplift something
[01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:38.380]   or thinks I'm only gonna spend $50 and not $500
[01:04:38.380 --> 01:04:40.460]   and therefore I'm not worth his time.
[01:04:40.460 --> 01:04:42.260]   And I'm aware of the fact
[01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:44.700]   that when I go into the clothing store,
[01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:47.980]   especially the high-end places where I can buy a good suit
[01:04:47.980 --> 01:04:50.620]   or buy some really good dress shirts
[01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:54.220]   or slacks that fit me well and so on,
[01:04:54.220 --> 01:04:57.460]   I'm aware of the fact that I may not be taken seriously
[01:04:57.460 --> 01:05:00.220]   by the salesman based upon the fact
[01:05:00.220 --> 01:05:03.140]   that he's looking at me and he sees a black person.
[01:05:03.140 --> 01:05:08.060]   And therefore, I dress up before I go out to buy clothes
[01:05:08.060 --> 01:05:10.460]   to get, 'cause I wanna present myself
[01:05:10.460 --> 01:05:13.140]   as not someone who just walked in off the street
[01:05:13.140 --> 01:05:14.540]   but as one of those black people
[01:05:14.540 --> 01:05:17.340]   who is really prepared to spend some money in the store
[01:05:17.340 --> 01:05:18.820]   so that I can be treated with respect.
[01:05:18.820 --> 01:05:23.740]   And I have to carry the burden, such as it is,
[01:05:23.740 --> 01:05:28.740]   of knowing that I need to earn the being taken seriously
[01:05:28.740 --> 01:05:34.680]   by overcoming the suppositions that people may have about me
[01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:37.620]   based upon the color of my skin.
[01:05:37.620 --> 01:05:39.340]   Something like that.
[01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:43.780]   Or I ask myself, what am I gonna teach my children
[01:05:43.780 --> 01:05:46.380]   about who they are and where they come from?
[01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:50.460]   What stories am I gonna tell them about their ancestors?
[01:05:50.460 --> 01:05:52.340]   Who are their ancestors?
[01:05:52.340 --> 01:05:55.860]   Every African-American has European ancestors.
[01:05:55.860 --> 01:05:58.420]   Every black person in the United States of America,
[01:05:58.420 --> 01:06:02.660]   I think that I can say that almost without exception.
[01:06:02.660 --> 01:06:05.900]   We could go to 23andMe and look at the DNA.
[01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:07.100]   They have European ancestors.
[01:06:07.100 --> 01:06:08.460]   They're not purely African.
[01:06:08.460 --> 01:06:12.260]   That's a fact and that's a consequence
[01:06:12.260 --> 01:06:16.180]   of the experience of African-descended people
[01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:17.960]   because it's a mixed population.
[01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:21.900]   My name is Lowry, spelled L-O-U-R-Y,
[01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:25.340]   but pronounced as if it were L-O-W-E-R-Y.
[01:06:25.340 --> 01:06:28.980]   And I gather, if you trace the history of that name,
[01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:30.640]   that it's Scottish.
[01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:33.420]   So somewhere back in--
[01:06:33.420 --> 01:06:35.900]   - So you could identify as a Scot.
[01:06:35.900 --> 01:06:38.880]   - Well, or I could claim some Scottish descent,
[01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:42.180]   but I don't, I don't know who those ancestors are.
[01:06:42.180 --> 01:06:47.060]   And frankly, I don't know who my enslaved ancestors are.
[01:06:47.060 --> 01:06:49.700]   I can't trace my family history back
[01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:53.160]   very far into the 19th century.
[01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:57.940]   But so what stories do I tell my children about who we are,
[01:06:57.940 --> 01:06:59.340]   about who their ancestors are?
[01:06:59.340 --> 01:07:01.900]   I mean, I wanna tell my children some story
[01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:05.300]   and that story is gonna be colored, quote unquote,
[01:07:05.300 --> 01:07:08.100]   by my race.
[01:07:08.100 --> 01:07:10.620]   So even though it is superficial,
[01:07:10.620 --> 01:07:14.260]   and in an ideal world, you might think,
[01:07:14.260 --> 01:07:17.980]   why would human beings, I mean, I read science fiction.
[01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:19.780]   So there's this Chinese writer,
[01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:21.480]   Chixin Liu is his name.
[01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:22.940]   I might not pronounce it exactly right.
[01:07:22.940 --> 01:07:27.340]   C-I-X-I-N-L-I-U, Chixin Liu.
[01:07:27.340 --> 01:07:30.380]   He has a trilogy, "The Three-Body Problem,"
[01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:35.820]   "The Dark Forest," and "Death's End."
[01:07:35.820 --> 01:07:38.780]   Those are the three books of Chixin Liu's trilogy
[01:07:38.780 --> 01:07:42.900]   about how Trisolaris, which is another star system
[01:07:42.900 --> 01:07:45.660]   within a few light years of the solar system
[01:07:45.660 --> 01:07:49.460]   and Earth get into a conflict.
[01:07:49.460 --> 01:07:55.420]   And when the Trisolarans come down to dominate Earth,
[01:07:55.420 --> 01:07:59.380]   suddenly all of these differences between the Chinese
[01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:02.420]   and the North Americans and the Europeans
[01:08:02.420 --> 01:08:04.660]   and the Africans and the South Asians
[01:08:04.660 --> 01:08:08.140]   become kind of insignificant because after all,
[01:08:08.140 --> 01:08:11.300]   the Trisolarans with their advanced civilization,
[01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:14.100]   whose star system is dying,
[01:08:14.100 --> 01:08:15.900]   have their eyes on the solar system,
[01:08:15.900 --> 01:08:18.020]   which has a planet, the third rock from the sun,
[01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:19.260]   that is pretty habitable.
[01:08:19.260 --> 01:08:23.500]   And the difference between us become pretty insignificant.
[01:08:24.540 --> 01:08:29.100]   So we shouldn't need for an invasion
[01:08:29.100 --> 01:08:34.100]   by extraterrestrial beings to have to happen
[01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:38.100]   before we would recognize the common humanity
[01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:43.100]   that we all share that is profound and is deep.
[01:08:43.100 --> 01:08:47.300]   We all descend, in effect, from the same ancestral population
[01:08:47.300 --> 01:08:52.180]   of Homo sapiens who walked out of East Africa eons ago
[01:08:52.180 --> 01:08:56.100]   and have survived amongst all of the different possible
[01:08:56.100 --> 01:09:00.820]   variations of species and whatnot of humanoid population.
[01:09:00.820 --> 01:09:04.860]   The Homo sapiens have flourished, the others have died out.
[01:09:04.860 --> 01:09:08.500]   And here we are and we can just look at the genetic
[01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:12.540]   endowments that characterize our biological essence
[01:09:12.540 --> 01:09:15.580]   and we can see that we are all, quote unquote,
[01:09:15.580 --> 01:09:19.340]   the same beneath the skin and yet we end up
[01:09:19.340 --> 01:09:23.500]   freighting so much weight onto these superficial differences.
[01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:27.620]   So I can see both sides of the issue is what I'm saying.
[01:09:27.620 --> 01:09:30.100]   I can see the argument race is an irrelevancy
[01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:35.540]   because at the end of the day, deep down, it is.
[01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:38.420]   But I can also see the argument that I hold on
[01:09:38.420 --> 01:09:42.820]   to racial identity because A, my racial presentation
[01:09:42.820 --> 01:09:46.420]   colors how other people deal with me,
[01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:50.020]   but B, because everybody needs a story.
[01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:52.580]   You know, everybody needs an account.
[01:09:52.580 --> 01:09:53.620]   You tell me you're Jewish.
[01:09:53.620 --> 01:09:55.420]   I mean, I don't know how deep that is.
[01:09:55.420 --> 01:09:57.760]   I don't know how genetically profound that is.
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:02.760]   I do know that it's a culturally profound identity
[01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:08.100]   for a lot of people based upon maybe some of the same
[01:10:08.100 --> 01:10:09.660]   kind of forces that I'm talking about.
[01:10:09.660 --> 01:10:11.860]   A, they won't let you not be Jewish.
[01:10:11.860 --> 01:10:14.260]   You could say you're not Jewish,
[01:10:14.260 --> 01:10:16.820]   but when Hitler is rounding people up,
[01:10:16.820 --> 01:10:18.660]   what you say doesn't have a whole lot to do
[01:10:18.660 --> 01:10:22.100]   with what the Gestapo was about.
[01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:24.580]   And B, you need to tell your children a story.
[01:10:24.580 --> 01:10:27.060]   - Yeah, well, that's the fascinating thing
[01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:29.480]   about this tribalism that you spoke about,
[01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:35.580]   that we form tribes as humans,
[01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:37.500]   throughout human history, form tribes
[01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:41.460]   and have directed hate toward other tribes
[01:10:41.460 --> 01:10:43.940]   and sometimes violence and destruction.
[01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:47.900]   And yet, tribalism allows you to tell a story
[01:10:47.900 --> 01:10:51.400]   to your children, allows you to grow a culture.
[01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:53.060]   There's something about defining yourself
[01:10:53.060 --> 01:10:55.660]   within a particular tribe that allows you
[01:10:55.660 --> 01:10:57.800]   to have a tradition.
[01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:02.220]   You have an article that you wrote
[01:11:02.220 --> 01:11:05.460]   called "The Case for Black Patriotism."
[01:11:05.460 --> 01:11:06.300]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:11:06.300 --> 01:11:10.780]   - So I should also say it's so interesting
[01:11:10.780 --> 01:11:15.780]   because for me personally, I feel,
[01:11:15.780 --> 01:11:21.020]   identify as, believe I am an American.
[01:11:21.020 --> 01:11:24.140]   And yet, within the American umbrella,
[01:11:24.140 --> 01:11:27.100]   it feels that there's a longing for other tribes.
[01:11:27.100 --> 01:11:31.580]   You mentioned Jewish, but what I honestly feel is,
[01:11:31.580 --> 01:11:34.460]   I mean, a lot of it is humor and culture and so on,
[01:11:34.460 --> 01:11:38.940]   is Russian and Ukrainian 'cause that's where I come from.
[01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:40.620]   That's where my family's from.
[01:11:40.620 --> 01:11:43.300]   You know, there's like stereotypical things
[01:11:43.300 --> 01:11:48.300]   that are funny, humorous type of thing about Russians,
[01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:52.800]   showing no emotion, good at chess and math,
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:57.020]   into wrestling, drinking vodka.
[01:11:57.020 --> 01:11:59.620]   I mean, there's literally every single stereotype.
[01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:01.380]   I'm in the embodiment of that.
[01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:04.180]   So there's a, you celebrate that in certain kinds of ways.
[01:12:04.180 --> 01:12:07.260]   There's a tradition there within the American umbrella.
[01:12:07.260 --> 01:12:09.140]   And some of it is humor.
[01:12:09.140 --> 01:12:13.060]   Some of it is a little quirks of culture.
[01:12:13.060 --> 01:12:15.100]   But now with the war in Russia and Ukraine,
[01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:18.660]   interestingly enough, even that little thing
[01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:22.940]   becomes also a source of negative tribalism.
[01:12:22.940 --> 01:12:26.580]   But anyway, that context aside,
[01:12:26.580 --> 01:12:31.580]   what is black patriotism and why do you feel?
[01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:35.180]   - I mean, I'm speaking in an article called
[01:12:35.180 --> 01:12:39.900]   "The Case for Black Patriotism" in a particular context.
[01:12:39.900 --> 01:12:45.420]   And what I'm saying basically is very simple.
[01:12:45.420 --> 01:12:47.580]   I'm saying we are African-Americans
[01:12:47.580 --> 01:12:51.340]   and the emphasis should be on the American.
[01:12:51.340 --> 01:12:56.220]   I actually don't even much care
[01:12:56.220 --> 01:13:00.540]   for the framing African-American,
[01:13:00.540 --> 01:13:02.860]   but I'm not gonna fight with people about it.
[01:13:02.860 --> 01:13:05.820]   It's, you know, I don't think it's worth fighting about.
[01:13:05.820 --> 01:13:08.380]   That's not how, I would just say we're Americans
[01:13:08.380 --> 01:13:11.020]   or if you want, we're black Americans.
[01:13:11.020 --> 01:13:12.620]   We're certainly not African.
[01:13:12.620 --> 01:13:16.340]   That is the African-American population
[01:13:16.340 --> 01:13:20.660]   is a population of people who come into existence
[01:13:20.660 --> 01:13:24.740]   here in North America through the cauldron of slavery.
[01:13:24.740 --> 01:13:28.820]   There are also immigrants, immigrants from East Africa,
[01:13:28.820 --> 01:13:30.900]   immigrants from West Africa,
[01:13:30.900 --> 01:13:32.980]   immigrants from Southern Africa,
[01:13:32.980 --> 01:13:34.900]   immigrants from the Caribbean
[01:13:34.900 --> 01:13:39.140]   who descend from an ancestral population, which is African.
[01:13:39.140 --> 01:13:42.820]   We, you know, the history of the world since 1500
[01:13:42.820 --> 01:13:46.620]   is a history in which people of African descent
[01:13:46.620 --> 01:13:49.420]   are scattered because of slavery
[01:13:49.420 --> 01:13:53.300]   throughout the Western hemisphere.
[01:13:53.300 --> 01:13:55.380]   And so here we are.
[01:13:56.300 --> 01:14:01.300]   But the institution of slavery ended in 1863
[01:14:01.300 --> 01:14:04.300]   in the United States.
[01:14:04.300 --> 01:14:08.820]   The struggle that we started out talking about,
[01:14:08.820 --> 01:14:13.420]   which gave rise to Martin Luther King,
[01:14:13.420 --> 01:14:15.660]   giving that speech that you say is the greatest speech
[01:14:15.660 --> 01:14:16.860]   in American history.
[01:14:16.860 --> 01:14:19.540]   And I'm not gonna argue with you about that.
[01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:21.340]   Happened right here in the United States.
[01:14:21.340 --> 01:14:22.180]   - Yes.
[01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:25.420]   - We are, what is the United States?
[01:14:25.420 --> 01:14:27.620]   The United States is a nation of immigrants.
[01:14:27.620 --> 01:14:31.340]   The population of the North American continent
[01:14:31.340 --> 01:14:34.060]   was sparsely populated by an indigenous population,
[01:14:34.060 --> 01:14:38.340]   which was destroyed in conquest
[01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:43.620]   by a European population that settled here in North America
[01:14:43.620 --> 01:14:46.260]   and appropriated the land
[01:14:46.260 --> 01:14:48.820]   and have built a civilization here,
[01:14:48.820 --> 01:14:51.980]   which has been peopled by a large influx
[01:14:51.980 --> 01:14:56.500]   of individuals from Europe, Irish and Italian
[01:14:56.500 --> 01:15:01.500]   and Greek and Slavic and Jewish, Russian Jews
[01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:04.220]   coming in large numbers and so on.
[01:15:04.220 --> 01:15:07.540]   And wave after wave after wave of immigration,
[01:15:07.540 --> 01:15:10.980]   Asian, Latin American population of people
[01:15:10.980 --> 01:15:13.820]   who have come to reside here in the United States.
[01:15:13.820 --> 01:15:17.420]   And we black Americans who descend from slaves.
[01:15:17.420 --> 01:15:20.020]   We African-Americans who descend from slaves.
[01:15:20.020 --> 01:15:21.540]   So here we are.
[01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:23.460]   This is a great nation.
[01:15:23.460 --> 01:15:28.460]   I mean, this is a monumentally significant political force,
[01:15:28.460 --> 01:15:31.780]   which is the United States of America
[01:15:31.780 --> 01:15:36.300]   founded in 1776, 1787,
[01:15:36.300 --> 01:15:41.020]   fought a war of independence from the British,
[01:15:41.020 --> 01:15:42.900]   established a Republic,
[01:15:42.900 --> 01:15:47.900]   which is a confederation of these independent colonies,
[01:15:47.900 --> 01:15:50.700]   which has grown into now the 50 States
[01:15:50.700 --> 01:15:54.060]   of the United States of America, a continental nation.
[01:15:54.060 --> 01:15:58.700]   The richest and most powerful nation on the planet
[01:15:58.700 --> 01:16:02.500]   with massive influence throughout the world
[01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:03.700]   for good and for ill.
[01:16:03.700 --> 01:16:08.860]   That's who we are, I wanna say to black people.
[01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:11.700]   There is no other home for us.
[01:16:11.700 --> 01:16:15.460]   This fantasy of we being a people apart.
[01:16:15.460 --> 01:16:20.060]   Back in the day when I was coming along in the 1960s,
[01:16:20.060 --> 01:16:20.900]   there was something called
[01:16:20.900 --> 01:16:23.780]   the Republic of New Africa Movement.
[01:16:23.780 --> 01:16:26.300]   And they wanted some States in the South
[01:16:26.300 --> 01:16:27.500]   giving over to black people
[01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:29.460]   and we were gonna have our own country.
[01:16:29.460 --> 01:16:33.460]   And that's a joke, it's a fantasy.
[01:16:33.460 --> 01:16:37.460]   It's a mythic, unbalanced,
[01:16:37.460 --> 01:16:46.620]   the unrealistic fanciful politics.
[01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:48.180]   It's not a serious politics.
[01:16:48.180 --> 01:16:51.860]   We're Americans, we're not going anywhere here.
[01:16:51.860 --> 01:16:54.540]   The idea that, and I wanna say this
[01:16:54.540 --> 01:16:56.820]   in a number of different registers.
[01:16:56.820 --> 01:16:58.780]   I wanna say, first of all,
[01:16:58.780 --> 01:17:00.540]   we need to make peace with the fact
[01:17:00.540 --> 01:17:03.260]   that that's who we are and that's where we are.
[01:17:03.260 --> 01:17:06.380]   So nobody is coming.
[01:17:06.380 --> 01:17:10.260]   The world court is not gonna litigate our disputes.
[01:17:10.260 --> 01:17:13.100]   The United Nations is not gonna set up a desk
[01:17:13.100 --> 01:17:17.260]   for people of African descent who reside in North America.
[01:17:17.260 --> 01:17:20.220]   We have to work out whatever our concerns are
[01:17:20.220 --> 01:17:22.220]   with our fellow Americans right here
[01:17:22.220 --> 01:17:25.220]   within the context of American politics.
[01:17:25.220 --> 01:17:27.340]   That means compromise.
[01:17:27.340 --> 01:17:32.340]   That means looking for a framework for political expression
[01:17:32.340 --> 01:17:36.420]   which is broader than our racial identity, et cetera.
[01:17:36.420 --> 01:17:38.260]   So I wanna say that.
[01:17:38.260 --> 01:17:39.660]   But I also wanna say there's no reason
[01:17:39.660 --> 01:17:40.860]   to apologize for this.
[01:17:40.860 --> 01:17:42.980]   There's something positive to affirm.
[01:17:42.980 --> 01:17:46.220]   I take on this question about slavery in brief,
[01:17:46.220 --> 01:17:49.780]   because in fact, slavery was awful and it was wrong
[01:17:49.780 --> 01:17:52.900]   and it was on the backs of the enslaved Africans
[01:17:52.900 --> 01:17:56.260]   and it had consequences that endured,
[01:17:56.260 --> 01:17:59.020]   that have endured long after the termination of the thing.
[01:17:59.020 --> 01:18:01.900]   But I also wanna say, look at what has happened
[01:18:01.900 --> 01:18:05.940]   in the last 150 years for African-Americans.
[01:18:05.940 --> 01:18:09.540]   And I wanna say, look at the vitality
[01:18:09.540 --> 01:18:12.780]   of the institutions here in the United States of America,
[01:18:12.780 --> 01:18:15.740]   of the Democratic Republic of the United States
[01:18:15.740 --> 01:18:19.620]   of America, again, not perfect,
[01:18:19.620 --> 01:18:22.780]   which are malleable enough, these institutions,
[01:18:22.780 --> 01:18:26.500]   to allow for the transformation of the status
[01:18:26.500 --> 01:18:29.380]   of African-Americans such as has occurred
[01:18:29.380 --> 01:18:32.140]   since the end of slavery.
[01:18:32.140 --> 01:18:35.020]   And I wanna say there's a lot to celebrate in that.
[01:18:35.020 --> 01:18:37.380]   So this is our country.
[01:18:37.380 --> 01:18:43.260]   We are full members of the polity.
[01:18:43.340 --> 01:18:47.780]   We have burdens and responsibilities,
[01:18:47.780 --> 01:18:50.140]   as well as privileges that are associated
[01:18:50.140 --> 01:18:52.260]   with our membership in this republic.
[01:18:52.260 --> 01:18:55.260]   That does not mean that we should not fight
[01:18:55.260 --> 01:18:56.860]   for what we believe to be right,
[01:18:56.860 --> 01:19:01.140]   although we are not one voice here, we Black Americans.
[01:19:01.140 --> 01:19:03.740]   It does not mean that we should not protest things
[01:19:03.740 --> 01:19:06.660]   that we think are deserving of protest.
[01:19:06.660 --> 01:19:10.940]   But I wanna say, it does mean that we should not reject
[01:19:10.940 --> 01:19:14.580]   the framework that we're operating in,
[01:19:14.580 --> 01:19:17.300]   because we basically don't have any alternative.
[01:19:17.300 --> 01:19:20.700]   And because when viewed in full context,
[01:19:20.700 --> 01:19:25.020]   a noble and profoundly significant achievement,
[01:19:25.020 --> 01:19:26.700]   the United States of America,
[01:19:26.700 --> 01:19:28.900]   and a beacon to the rest of the world.
[01:19:28.900 --> 01:19:31.900]   I don't wanna go off in some starry-eyed
[01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:35.260]   kind of jingoistic celebration of America
[01:19:35.260 --> 01:19:38.140]   as the greatest civilization, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:43.140]   But this great nation is our nation.
[01:19:43.140 --> 01:19:47.700]   And I think we do best by beginning,
[01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:49.740]   we Black Americans do best by beginning,
[01:19:49.740 --> 01:19:51.480]   this is my argument in the piece,
[01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:56.480]   by beginning from a framework which accepts that fact
[01:19:56.480 --> 01:19:58.060]   and then builds on it.
[01:19:58.060 --> 01:20:05.180]   - So Black patriotism is not exactly the same,
[01:20:07.180 --> 01:20:11.100]   rhymes, echoes, American patriotism.
[01:20:11.100 --> 01:20:15.980]   So a Black American is first and foremost an American.
[01:20:15.980 --> 01:20:17.380]   - Yeah.
[01:20:17.380 --> 01:20:20.140]   A Black American is first and foremost an American,
[01:20:20.140 --> 01:20:21.560]   and it's a good thing too.
[01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:29.460]   - Let me return to the question of Dr. King
[01:20:29.460 --> 01:20:35.140]   and another powerful, impactful individual, Malcolm X,
[01:20:35.780 --> 01:20:37.780]   to ask you the question.
[01:20:37.780 --> 01:20:41.500]   Well, first, people often perhaps inaccurately
[01:20:41.500 --> 01:20:47.580]   portray them as representing two different ideals,
[01:20:47.580 --> 01:20:52.020]   approaches to the fight for civil rights.
[01:20:52.020 --> 01:20:56.300]   So Martin Luther King for the nonviolent approach,
[01:20:56.300 --> 01:21:01.300]   the peacemaker, and Malcolm X is the by any means necessary.
[01:21:01.300 --> 01:21:05.300]   What do you think about this distinction?
[01:21:05.300 --> 01:21:08.420]   And broadly speaking in Black patriotism,
[01:21:08.420 --> 01:21:12.540]   in the future of Black Americans in the 21st century,
[01:21:12.540 --> 01:21:15.060]   what is the role of anger?
[01:21:15.060 --> 01:21:18.260]   What is the role of protests?
[01:21:18.260 --> 01:21:22.100]   Even violence encompasses a lot of things,
[01:21:22.100 --> 01:21:25.780]   but just aggression and the,
[01:21:25.780 --> 01:21:28.860]   fuck the man we're going to have to make change,
[01:21:28.860 --> 01:21:29.880]   force change.
[01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:33.040]   - Okay, I think you put your finger
[01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:34.700]   on something really important
[01:21:34.700 --> 01:21:36.780]   in the context of we were just discussing
[01:21:36.780 --> 01:21:39.140]   my Black patriotism essay.
[01:21:39.140 --> 01:21:43.920]   And it's not the only story.
[01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:46.100]   There is another story,
[01:21:46.100 --> 01:21:48.700]   and Malcolm X is someone you identify,
[01:21:48.700 --> 01:21:53.700]   and his memory lives on and is powerfully influential.
[01:21:53.700 --> 01:21:58.460]   And I think you see it in Black Lives Matter,
[01:21:58.460 --> 01:22:01.980]   and I think you see it in the protest and rioting
[01:22:01.980 --> 01:22:04.900]   and so forth that has broken out periodically
[01:22:04.900 --> 01:22:07.020]   going all the way back to the 1960s and before,
[01:22:07.020 --> 01:22:10.940]   but especially since the 1960s.
[01:22:10.940 --> 01:22:14.580]   You saw it in Los Angeles in 1992,
[01:22:14.580 --> 01:22:19.180]   the Rodney King civil disturbances that broke out there,
[01:22:19.180 --> 01:22:21.380]   and the balled up fist,
[01:22:21.380 --> 01:22:26.380]   the radical Afrocentric rejection of the American story
[01:22:26.380 --> 01:22:31.700]   that Martin Luther King,
[01:22:31.700 --> 01:22:32.520]   he believed in,
[01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:35.300]   he believed in a magnificent promissory note.
[01:22:35.300 --> 01:22:37.940]   And a lot of people are rolling their eyes
[01:22:37.940 --> 01:22:39.620]   and saying, as you say,
[01:22:39.620 --> 01:22:42.180]   fuck the man, magnificent promissory note?
[01:22:42.180 --> 01:22:46.100]   I mean, just get your knee off my neck.
[01:22:46.100 --> 01:22:47.180]   That's what you can do for me.
[01:22:47.180 --> 01:22:49.220]   Don't ask me to believe in your BS
[01:22:49.220 --> 01:22:51.180]   about some magnificent promissory note,
[01:22:51.180 --> 01:22:54.620]   some founding fathers who were all slave owners anyway.
[01:22:54.620 --> 01:22:56.540]   I mean, just get your knee off my neck.
[01:22:56.540 --> 01:23:00.660]   Now, I can relate to that.
[01:23:00.660 --> 01:23:05.020]   As I mentioned, I grew up in Chicago in the 1950s
[01:23:05.020 --> 01:23:06.180]   and the 1960s.
[01:23:06.180 --> 01:23:10.140]   I remember Malcolm X, I mean, literally in real time.
[01:23:10.140 --> 01:23:14.260]   I remember when he was murdered in 1965
[01:23:14.260 --> 01:23:18.060]   in the Audubon Ballroom in Harlem,
[01:23:18.060 --> 01:23:21.120]   in Manhattan, in New York City.
[01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:24.700]   I remember my uncle,
[01:23:24.700 --> 01:23:27.900]   I was raised in a house where my aunt and uncle
[01:23:27.900 --> 01:23:29.780]   were the master of the house,
[01:23:29.780 --> 01:23:31.340]   and my mother and my sister and I
[01:23:31.340 --> 01:23:34.540]   lived in a small apartment upstairs
[01:23:34.540 --> 01:23:36.900]   in the back of this big house
[01:23:36.900 --> 01:23:40.940]   that my successful aunt and uncle owned.
[01:23:40.940 --> 01:23:42.620]   And my uncle was a small businessman,
[01:23:42.620 --> 01:23:45.980]   a barber and a tradesman.
[01:23:45.980 --> 01:23:48.900]   He was a hustler, I mean, legally,
[01:23:48.900 --> 01:23:50.460]   he did what he had to do to make money.
[01:23:50.460 --> 01:23:53.800]   He was very enterprising, not especially well-educated,
[01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:57.380]   but a very intelligent and disciplined
[01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:01.600]   and resourceful provider for his family,
[01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:04.460]   which included myself, my sister,
[01:24:04.460 --> 01:24:07.020]   and my mother and their household.
[01:24:07.020 --> 01:24:08.460]   And we called him Uncle Mooney
[01:24:08.460 --> 01:24:10.900]   because he had moon-shaped eyes
[01:24:10.900 --> 01:24:12.340]   that protruded and were round.
[01:24:12.340 --> 01:24:17.340]   Uncle Mooney, James Ellis was his name, Uncle Mooney.
[01:24:17.340 --> 01:24:21.700]   James Ellis Lee was my Uncle Mooney.
[01:24:21.700 --> 01:24:24.340]   But I'm saying all that to say this,
[01:24:24.340 --> 01:24:27.020]   he admired the nation of Islam.
[01:24:27.020 --> 01:24:29.860]   I mean, King and Malcolm X,
[01:24:29.860 --> 01:24:31.620]   Martin King and Malcolm X differed
[01:24:31.620 --> 01:24:33.020]   along a number of different dimensions.
[01:24:33.020 --> 01:24:34.420]   Malcolm X was a Muslim,
[01:24:34.420 --> 01:24:37.940]   and Martin Luther King Jr. was a Christian minister.
[01:24:37.940 --> 01:24:41.920]   My Uncle Mooney didn't have any time
[01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:44.100]   for these Christian ministers.
[01:24:44.100 --> 01:24:46.300]   He thought that was the white man's religion.
[01:24:46.300 --> 01:24:50.660]   And back in that day, you'd go into a black church
[01:24:50.660 --> 01:24:53.300]   and you'd see a portrait of Jesus,
[01:24:53.300 --> 01:24:57.260]   and he'd be a blonde hair, blue eyed.
[01:24:57.260 --> 01:25:00.180]   He didn't even look like a Mediterranean.
[01:25:00.180 --> 01:25:03.580]   He didn't look like somebody who came from Palestine.
[01:25:03.580 --> 01:25:05.620]   I mean, he looked like somebody who came
[01:25:05.620 --> 01:25:07.140]   from Northern Europe or something like that,
[01:25:07.140 --> 01:25:07.980]   the picture of Jesus.
[01:25:07.980 --> 01:25:10.980]   And my Uncle Mooney rejected that whole thing.
[01:25:10.980 --> 01:25:13.940]   He would be damned if he was gonna bend his knee
[01:25:13.940 --> 01:25:16.340]   to some white Jesus.
[01:25:16.340 --> 01:25:19.620]   But he was not a Muslim either,
[01:25:19.620 --> 01:25:22.020]   but he respected the Muslims.
[01:25:22.020 --> 01:25:24.020]   He brought home their newspaper.
[01:25:24.020 --> 01:25:25.460]   It was called "Mohammad Speaks."
[01:25:25.460 --> 01:25:28.060]   This is the Nation of Islam,
[01:25:28.060 --> 01:25:30.700]   which is the black Muslim movement
[01:25:30.700 --> 01:25:35.700]   founded in American cities in Detroit and in Chicago,
[01:25:35.700 --> 01:25:40.340]   going back to the early, middle 20th century
[01:25:40.340 --> 01:25:43.780]   and growing into a very significant movement
[01:25:43.780 --> 01:25:44.940]   that had a lot of influence.
[01:25:44.940 --> 01:25:48.660]   Louis Farrakhan, controversial figure,
[01:25:48.660 --> 01:25:49.980]   descends from this movement.
[01:25:49.980 --> 01:25:54.980]   It has fractured now and has the major part
[01:25:54.980 --> 01:25:59.020]   of the legacy of the black Muslims
[01:25:59.020 --> 01:26:03.220]   has assimilated itself into Islam proper.
[01:26:03.220 --> 01:26:08.740]   Malcolm X made a famous pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina
[01:26:08.740 --> 01:26:11.180]   and came back with a very different vision
[01:26:11.180 --> 01:26:12.820]   about what it meant to be a Muslim
[01:26:12.820 --> 01:26:16.660]   and understood himself to be a part of the large tradition
[01:26:16.660 --> 01:26:19.380]   and religious culture of Islam
[01:26:19.380 --> 01:26:20.580]   that has a global reach.
[01:26:20.580 --> 01:26:23.900]   And he had a different vision when he came back from that.
[01:26:23.900 --> 01:26:27.260]   Some people say that's why he was killed and so on.
[01:26:27.260 --> 01:26:28.460]   I don't know.
[01:26:28.460 --> 01:26:30.300]   I certainly find that to be plausible
[01:26:30.300 --> 01:26:34.180]   that he became the constitutive threat to the sect,
[01:26:34.180 --> 01:26:39.180]   which was the black Muslims and had to be dealt with.
[01:26:39.180 --> 01:26:43.260]   I don't know if we'll ever know the full story on that.
[01:26:43.260 --> 01:26:45.580]   But anyway, what I'm trying to say is
[01:26:45.580 --> 01:26:47.740]   the black Muslims were there, Malcolm X was there.
[01:26:47.740 --> 01:26:52.740]   And in my experience, they constituted a counterpoint
[01:26:52.740 --> 01:26:55.740]   to the position of king,
[01:26:55.740 --> 01:26:59.620]   which depended on a kind of respect
[01:26:59.620 --> 01:27:04.620]   for the best of the tradition of American democracy,
[01:27:04.620 --> 01:27:10.340]   appealing to the better nature of our oppressors,
[01:27:10.340 --> 01:27:13.660]   live up to the full meaning of our creed.
[01:27:13.660 --> 01:27:15.900]   I mean, these are words that he would use.
[01:27:15.900 --> 01:27:19.500]   A magnificent promissory note is what he would think of
[01:27:19.500 --> 01:27:21.260]   as the declaration of independence
[01:27:21.260 --> 01:27:26.260]   and the legacy of Abraham Lincoln, unfulfilled ideal.
[01:27:26.260 --> 01:27:30.220]   And the black Muslims were like,
[01:27:30.220 --> 01:27:33.940]   "Fuck that, we're gonna take care of our own.
[01:27:33.940 --> 01:27:37.020]   We're gonna build our own schools.
[01:27:37.020 --> 01:27:38.940]   We're gonna build our own businesses.
[01:27:38.940 --> 01:27:42.300]   We're not waiting for the white man to do anything.
[01:27:42.300 --> 01:27:44.260]   Get your knee off my neck and get out of my way
[01:27:44.260 --> 01:27:46.260]   and let me take care of my own."
[01:27:46.260 --> 01:27:47.500]   And my uncle respected that.
[01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:49.860]   He respected the straight back,
[01:27:49.860 --> 01:27:52.540]   stand up straight with your shoulders back.
[01:27:52.540 --> 01:27:54.060]   That's a Jordan Peterson, but I mean,
[01:27:54.060 --> 01:27:56.140]   that was way before Jordan Peterson,
[01:27:56.140 --> 01:27:57.300]   but that was his philosophy.
[01:27:57.300 --> 01:28:00.220]   Stand up straight, but just raise your children.
[01:28:00.220 --> 01:28:02.300]   Don't be depending upon welfare.
[01:28:02.300 --> 01:28:04.940]   You're taking welfare from the white man?
[01:28:04.940 --> 01:28:05.940]   You need to get busy.
[01:28:05.940 --> 01:28:07.620]   You need to educate yourself.
[01:28:07.620 --> 01:28:08.700]   You need to clean up your act,
[01:28:08.700 --> 01:28:12.020]   put down the fried chicken 'cause it's gonna kill you.
[01:28:13.020 --> 01:28:18.020]   My uncle Mooney loved this book that Elijah Muhammad,
[01:28:18.020 --> 01:28:20.380]   they called him the Honorable Elijah Muhammad,
[01:28:20.380 --> 01:28:23.500]   who was the founder and the leader of the nation of Islam.
[01:28:23.500 --> 01:28:26.780]   He had a book and all the book said was,
[01:28:26.780 --> 01:28:31.340]   "Be smart, eat green vegetables, don't eat fried food,
[01:28:31.340 --> 01:28:32.620]   don't eat pork."
[01:28:32.620 --> 01:28:33.700]   They're Muslims.
[01:28:33.700 --> 01:28:38.420]   "Don't eat pork and take responsibility for your diet
[01:28:38.420 --> 01:28:39.820]   and be healthy.
[01:28:39.820 --> 01:28:42.780]   And don't be putting a whole lot of pills
[01:28:42.780 --> 01:28:43.620]   into your body.
[01:28:43.620 --> 01:28:44.460]   You don't need to do that
[01:28:44.460 --> 01:28:45.940]   if you just get control of your diet
[01:28:45.940 --> 01:28:47.620]   and you eat properly."
[01:28:47.620 --> 01:28:52.620]   Now, my uncle loved this idea of responsibility for self
[01:28:52.620 --> 01:28:56.500]   and a determination to build.
[01:28:56.500 --> 01:29:00.060]   He respected that in the Muslims,
[01:29:00.060 --> 01:29:02.900]   even if he didn't buy the religious part of it.
[01:29:02.900 --> 01:29:08.420]   And so, and by the way, when my uncle died in 1983,
[01:29:08.780 --> 01:29:13.780]   in 1983, he left me a bequest.
[01:29:13.780 --> 01:29:18.060]   It wasn't money, unfortunately.
[01:29:18.060 --> 01:29:21.700]   It was his complete collection
[01:29:21.700 --> 01:29:24.660]   of the recorded speeches of Malcolm X.
[01:29:24.660 --> 01:29:30.180]   And I have these albums, these are 33 and a third LPs,
[01:29:30.180 --> 01:29:31.300]   there's six of them.
[01:29:31.300 --> 01:29:34.700]   And I have a complete collection,
[01:29:34.700 --> 01:29:36.180]   as best as my uncle could assemble,
[01:29:36.180 --> 01:29:37.580]   of the recorded speeches of Malcolm X.
[01:29:37.580 --> 01:29:39.220]   Now, why did he do that?
[01:29:39.220 --> 01:29:42.220]   He did that because he did not want me to forget,
[01:29:42.220 --> 01:29:43.940]   "Don't be dependent upon the white man.
[01:29:43.940 --> 01:29:48.060]   Build your own, stand up straight with your shoulders back,
[01:29:48.060 --> 01:29:51.540]   proud black man, take care of your business.
[01:29:51.540 --> 01:29:53.540]   Take care of your children.
[01:29:53.540 --> 01:29:56.380]   Pick up the trash in front of your house.
[01:29:56.380 --> 01:29:57.580]   Get busy."
[01:29:57.580 --> 01:30:00.460]   This was this philosophy.
[01:30:00.460 --> 01:30:05.620]   So, violence now, that's another story.
[01:30:05.620 --> 01:30:08.380]   I mean, Malcolm X would say,
[01:30:08.380 --> 01:30:09.780]   "We're gonna defend ourselves.
[01:30:09.780 --> 01:30:13.820]   You're gonna mess with us, you racist Ku Klux Klan
[01:30:13.820 --> 01:30:16.300]   or whatever, we're gonna arm ourselves
[01:30:16.300 --> 01:30:17.460]   and we're gonna fight you back.
[01:30:17.460 --> 01:30:22.460]   You racist police who are oppressing and persecuting
[01:30:22.460 --> 01:30:27.020]   and abusing our people, well, you better be ready
[01:30:27.020 --> 01:30:28.820]   because we're gonna fight you back."
[01:30:28.820 --> 01:30:33.300]   And that too was the spirit that my uncle,
[01:30:33.300 --> 01:30:36.100]   that was a kind of attitude, a kind of posture.
[01:30:36.100 --> 01:30:38.620]   My uncle was not a radical, he was a businessman,
[01:30:38.620 --> 01:30:41.740]   but he respected this idea.
[01:30:41.740 --> 01:30:45.860]   You take your life in your own hands when you mess with us
[01:30:45.860 --> 01:30:48.420]   because we're prepared to defend ourselves.
[01:30:48.420 --> 01:30:50.220]   - So that blood runs in you too.
[01:30:50.220 --> 01:30:53.420]   That thread is, when you write about black patriotism,
[01:30:53.420 --> 01:30:55.340]   that thread is there too.
[01:30:55.340 --> 01:31:00.340]   It's like you embody both the ideal that we're all American,
[01:31:00.820 --> 01:31:05.340]   but also that there is this oppressive history.
[01:31:05.340 --> 01:31:10.340]   There is the powerful that are manipulating you,
[01:31:10.340 --> 01:31:16.220]   that are oppressing you, and you can't just wait around
[01:31:16.220 --> 01:31:18.340]   for things to fix themselves.
[01:31:18.340 --> 01:31:20.900]   You have to take action.
[01:31:20.900 --> 01:31:22.780]   You have to take things into your own hands.
[01:31:22.780 --> 01:31:24.580]   And sometimes that means being angry.
[01:31:24.580 --> 01:31:26.740]   Sometimes that means being violent.
[01:31:26.740 --> 01:31:27.900]   That's there too.
[01:31:28.900 --> 01:31:33.260]   - Yeah, it's there, but here, and the but is,
[01:31:33.260 --> 01:31:37.540]   I don't, me today, Glenn Lowry in 2022,
[01:31:37.540 --> 01:31:40.420]   think that that is the answer.
[01:31:40.420 --> 01:31:43.060]   I don't think that violent rebellion
[01:31:43.060 --> 01:31:46.660]   gets us anywhere at the end of the day.
[01:31:46.660 --> 01:31:49.100]   I think we're past that.
[01:31:49.100 --> 01:31:52.820]   There aren't Knight Rider, Ku Klux Klan,
[01:31:52.820 --> 01:31:55.700]   people breaking down your door and dragging you away.
[01:31:55.700 --> 01:32:00.700]   There are not nooses thrown over a tree limb
[01:32:00.700 --> 01:32:03.540]   where you hang somebody from the tree
[01:32:03.540 --> 01:32:05.380]   because they whistled at a white woman,
[01:32:05.380 --> 01:32:07.940]   or they got too much property in your community,
[01:32:07.940 --> 01:32:10.220]   and you became, you know, they were uppity Negroes
[01:32:10.220 --> 01:32:11.060]   and whatnot like that.
[01:32:11.060 --> 01:32:14.820]   That is a thing of the past in America,
[01:32:14.820 --> 01:32:19.340]   that the situation is no longer the one
[01:32:19.340 --> 01:32:23.140]   that requires that kind of violent reaction.
[01:32:23.140 --> 01:32:27.660]   And that there is, if we look at the net effect
[01:32:27.660 --> 01:32:32.660]   of the so-called rebellions in American cities,
[01:32:32.660 --> 01:32:34.860]   they're negative.
[01:32:34.860 --> 01:32:38.620]   The George Floyd protests,
[01:32:38.620 --> 01:32:42.020]   which became violent and arsonist
[01:32:42.020 --> 01:32:44.140]   in the aftermath of civil disturbance
[01:32:44.140 --> 01:32:47.060]   and whatnot in the summer of 2020,
[01:32:47.060 --> 01:32:50.900]   I think set back the program for African-Americans.
[01:32:50.900 --> 01:32:52.340]   I don't think it advanced it.
[01:32:53.340 --> 01:32:56.940]   I think there are things to be concerned about,
[01:32:56.940 --> 01:32:59.140]   schools that are not working,
[01:32:59.140 --> 01:33:02.540]   police that are not respecting citizens and so forth.
[01:33:02.540 --> 01:33:04.900]   But I think that those are things
[01:33:04.900 --> 01:33:07.580]   that affect white Americans as well,
[01:33:07.580 --> 01:33:12.580]   and that the way to ultimately correct those things
[01:33:12.580 --> 01:33:18.620]   is to make alliance and associate oneself
[01:33:19.780 --> 01:33:23.220]   with Americans who are concerned to change these things.
[01:33:23.220 --> 01:33:27.660]   And I don't think it's properly framed as a racial problem.
[01:33:27.660 --> 01:33:32.900]   And I certainly don't think that, you know,
[01:33:32.900 --> 01:33:37.900]   violent rebellion gets us anywhere.
[01:33:37.900 --> 01:33:43.420]   You know, I get the historical salience of that posture,
[01:33:43.420 --> 01:33:47.140]   and it made a lot of sense
[01:33:47.140 --> 01:33:49.940]   in the early and the mid 20th century.
[01:33:49.940 --> 01:33:51.740]   I don't think it makes very much sense at all
[01:33:51.740 --> 01:33:53.420]   in the early 21st century.
[01:33:53.420 --> 01:33:57.580]   - Well, thank you for allowing me for a brief moment
[01:33:57.580 --> 01:33:59.820]   to try to channel your Uncle Mooney
[01:33:59.820 --> 01:34:02.300]   and maybe Malcolm X in this conversation
[01:34:02.300 --> 01:34:05.300]   as we look forward to the 21st century.
[01:34:05.300 --> 01:34:09.980]   You mentioned that in part you're troubled
[01:34:09.980 --> 01:34:13.020]   by the term African-American.
[01:34:13.020 --> 01:34:18.020]   So words are funny things, until they're not.
[01:34:18.020 --> 01:34:20.860]   So let me ask you about what I think
[01:34:20.860 --> 01:34:22.900]   is one of the most powerful and controversial words
[01:34:22.900 --> 01:34:25.580]   in the English language, the N-word.
[01:34:25.580 --> 01:34:31.820]   So this is a word that I can't say,
[01:34:31.820 --> 01:34:34.900]   that only certain people have the right to say.
[01:34:34.900 --> 01:34:38.900]   I have a friend, Joe Rogan, who has,
[01:34:38.900 --> 01:34:41.740]   what would you say?
[01:34:41.740 --> 01:34:44.780]   There was mass pushback or highlighting
[01:34:44.780 --> 01:34:48.180]   of the fact that he didn't just say N-word,
[01:34:48.180 --> 01:34:51.980]   but said the full word many times
[01:34:51.980 --> 01:34:55.480]   throughout his conversations when referring to,
[01:34:55.480 --> 01:35:00.540]   in a meta way, about the power of words,
[01:35:00.540 --> 01:35:03.460]   especially when related to certain comedians
[01:35:03.460 --> 01:35:04.680]   using those words.
[01:35:04.680 --> 01:35:07.280]   - Yeah.
[01:35:07.280 --> 01:35:09.340]   - What do you think about this word?
[01:35:10.380 --> 01:35:12.700]   Is it empowering?
[01:35:12.700 --> 01:35:14.320]   Is it destructive?
[01:35:14.320 --> 01:35:17.580]   What is it?
[01:35:17.580 --> 01:35:20.700]   What does it mean for race in America?
[01:35:20.700 --> 01:35:24.500]   What does it mean that people like Joe Rogan
[01:35:24.500 --> 01:35:29.500]   were essentially, there's an attack to cancel him
[01:35:29.500 --> 01:35:31.180]   for using the word?
[01:35:31.180 --> 01:35:33.820]   Just as a scholar of human nature,
[01:35:33.820 --> 01:35:36.140]   what do you think about this whole thing?
[01:35:36.140 --> 01:35:39.140]   - This is a phenomenon that interests me.
[01:35:39.140 --> 01:35:43.060]   Okay, the N-word, nigger.
[01:35:43.060 --> 01:35:44.860]   I can say it because I'm Black.
[01:35:44.860 --> 01:35:48.060]   But I mean, I can also say it because I like hip hop.
[01:35:48.060 --> 01:35:50.540]   And when I listen to hip hop, I hear the word all the time.
[01:35:50.540 --> 01:35:52.620]   These niggers ain't did, you know,
[01:35:52.620 --> 01:35:54.660]   watch out for these, you know, et cetera.
[01:35:54.660 --> 01:35:59.020]   I heard the word constantly as I was growing up
[01:35:59.020 --> 01:36:01.700]   as a boy and a young man in Chicago.
[01:36:01.700 --> 01:36:03.340]   Niggers ain't shit.
[01:36:03.340 --> 01:36:04.780]   That was said.
[01:36:04.780 --> 01:36:08.020]   That was, you know, and that could be a reflection
[01:36:08.020 --> 01:36:10.380]   of some kind of pathology
[01:36:10.380 --> 01:36:13.060]   within the African-American community of self-hatred
[01:36:13.060 --> 01:36:14.140]   and so forth.
[01:36:14.140 --> 01:36:17.460]   It could be, or it could just be a colloquial,
[01:36:17.460 --> 01:36:18.340]   linguistic way.
[01:36:18.340 --> 01:36:23.180]   I mean, I assume other groups also have their various,
[01:36:23.180 --> 01:36:26.500]   I don't know how the Irish talk about their Irish brothers
[01:36:26.500 --> 01:36:27.740]   and you know, whatever.
[01:36:27.740 --> 01:36:30.660]   And I don't know how the Jews talk about
[01:36:30.660 --> 01:36:33.220]   the Jewish brothers and whatever.
[01:36:33.220 --> 01:36:35.780]   But Black people, when talking about other Black people,
[01:36:35.780 --> 01:36:39.140]   use the N word all the time.
[01:36:39.140 --> 01:36:45.140]   My nigger, N-I-G-G-A, you know, my nigger.
[01:36:45.140 --> 01:36:47.980]   That is a term of endearment.
[01:36:47.980 --> 01:36:50.940]   My friend, Randall Kennedy,
[01:36:50.940 --> 01:36:55.140]   the law professor at Harvard University
[01:36:55.140 --> 01:36:57.420]   has a book called "Nigger"
[01:36:57.420 --> 01:37:00.180]   and he uses the word in the title of the book,
[01:37:00.180 --> 01:37:04.780]   the history of a strange history of a provocative word.
[01:37:04.780 --> 01:37:06.020]   There's something like that, there's a subtitle.
[01:37:06.020 --> 01:37:11.020]   But the title of the book is N-I-G-G-E-R, colon,
[01:37:11.020 --> 01:37:13.300]   and then he has a subtitle.
[01:37:13.300 --> 01:37:20.660]   I think, of course, the use of the word as a slur
[01:37:20.660 --> 01:37:25.660]   and an insult, which is a part of the history
[01:37:25.660 --> 01:37:28.100]   of Black people in the United States,
[01:37:28.100 --> 01:37:32.060]   the use of the word by the Southern racist segregationists,
[01:37:32.060 --> 01:37:33.620]   we don't want no niggers up in here.
[01:37:33.620 --> 01:37:36.340]   Y'all, niggers have no place in my restaurant,
[01:37:36.340 --> 01:37:38.180]   in my store, et cetera.
[01:37:38.180 --> 01:37:40.380]   That's meant to be an insult.
[01:37:40.380 --> 01:37:42.420]   It's an insult to people, it's a fighting word.
[01:37:42.420 --> 01:37:45.180]   It's a way that you say that to somebody.
[01:37:45.180 --> 01:37:48.200]   It's an invitation for conflict.
[01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:53.060]   - That said, what is it that about this particular word
[01:37:53.060 --> 01:37:55.420]   and also the asymmetry of it
[01:37:55.420 --> 01:37:57.740]   that do you think it's empowering
[01:37:57.740 --> 01:38:01.580]   to the Black community to own a word?
[01:38:02.100 --> 01:38:06.260]   - My honest answer to you is I don't know.
[01:38:06.260 --> 01:38:08.420]   I don't fully understand it.
[01:38:08.420 --> 01:38:11.100]   It has become symbolic in a way.
[01:38:11.100 --> 01:38:13.560]   And the policing of the use of the word,
[01:38:13.560 --> 01:38:15.620]   I can say it, but white people can't say it.
[01:38:15.620 --> 01:38:17.260]   I can say it, I'm not a racist.
[01:38:17.260 --> 01:38:18.700]   I'm not a self-hating Black.
[01:38:18.700 --> 01:38:24.540]   I'm just speaking the language of colloquial English
[01:38:24.540 --> 01:38:26.900]   that has emerged amongst African-Americans
[01:38:26.900 --> 01:38:29.380]   in which that word plays a big role.
[01:38:29.380 --> 01:38:32.340]   But the prohibition on its use by others,
[01:38:32.340 --> 01:38:34.920]   and of course, in the Joe Rogan case,
[01:38:34.920 --> 01:38:38.860]   it wasn't as if he was calling anybody an N-word.
[01:38:38.860 --> 01:38:42.360]   He was simply pointing out that people had said stuff
[01:38:42.360 --> 01:38:45.120]   in which the N-word was a part of what they said.
[01:38:45.120 --> 01:38:47.000]   Now, he did make the statement about,
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.780]   how did he put it, Planet of the Apes,
[01:38:49.780 --> 01:38:53.220]   that one of the offensive things that he said,
[01:38:53.220 --> 01:38:54.100]   he walked into a room,
[01:38:54.100 --> 01:38:55.500]   there's a bunch of Black guys standing around,
[01:38:55.500 --> 01:38:57.340]   he says, "It's like Planet of the Apes."
[01:38:57.340 --> 01:38:59.860]   - He said it's like Africa, Planet of the Apes.
[01:38:59.860 --> 01:39:01.820]   - Yeah, he should have, and he did apologize for that.
[01:39:01.820 --> 01:39:03.820]   - He should have been a little bit more careful.
[01:39:03.820 --> 01:39:05.460]   - That was an insult.
[01:39:05.460 --> 01:39:09.040]   That was something that,
[01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:12.300]   if you say that and people are offended,
[01:39:12.300 --> 01:39:13.380]   they have a right to be offended.
[01:39:13.380 --> 01:39:15.620]   And if you didn't mean to offend them, you can apologize.
[01:39:15.620 --> 01:39:18.140]   And he did apologize, I accept his apology.
[01:39:18.140 --> 01:39:20.680]   Joe's okay with me, as far as that goes.
[01:39:20.680 --> 01:39:25.580]   In fact, John McWhorter and I, at the podcast that I do,
[01:39:25.580 --> 01:39:27.140]   The Glenn Show, I had a conversation,
[01:39:27.140 --> 01:39:29.540]   part of which touched on the Joe Rogan phenomenon,
[01:39:29.540 --> 01:39:31.780]   and we concluded he didn't really do anything wrong.
[01:39:31.780 --> 01:39:34.940]   I mean, you can like Irma, you can hate him or whatever,
[01:39:34.940 --> 01:39:38.340]   but the idea that he's a racist is kind of ridiculous.
[01:39:38.340 --> 01:39:41.860]   Frankly, I mean, Joe, you know.
[01:39:41.860 --> 01:39:44.780]   If that's your test of what constitutes a racist,
[01:39:44.780 --> 01:39:46.200]   the utterance of the word,
[01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:52.940]   then it's kind of silly, as far as I'm concerned.
[01:39:53.380 --> 01:39:58.380]   - What do you think about the rigorous testing of people
[01:39:58.380 --> 01:40:01.100]   to the degree they're racist or not?
[01:40:01.100 --> 01:40:04.180]   The accusation of racism being a way
[01:40:04.180 --> 01:40:09.960]   to attack, to bully, to divide.
[01:40:09.960 --> 01:40:13.360]   So what are the pros and cons of that, once again?
[01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:16.260]   'Cause it does reveal the assholes and the racists,
[01:40:16.260 --> 01:40:20.620]   but it can hurt people who are not.
[01:40:20.620 --> 01:40:25.620]   - Well, I think we have a history here in the United States
[01:40:25.620 --> 01:40:30.860]   of blatant racism that goes back a long way
[01:40:30.860 --> 01:40:33.120]   and that has present day echoes.
[01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:36.020]   So there are racists.
[01:40:36.020 --> 01:40:38.500]   I mean, there are people who will look and see,
[01:40:38.500 --> 01:40:39.700]   oh, those are black people,
[01:40:39.700 --> 01:40:40.980]   they're patronizing this business,
[01:40:40.980 --> 01:40:43.060]   I don't want to patronize this business anymore,
[01:40:43.060 --> 01:40:45.860]   who, if their daughter or their son is dating somebody
[01:40:45.860 --> 01:40:47.820]   that is black, they will say,
[01:40:47.820 --> 01:40:49.140]   I really wish you wouldn't do that.
[01:40:49.140 --> 01:40:50.780]   I mean, why are you hanging out with those people?
[01:40:50.780 --> 01:40:52.620]   Don't you know who they are?
[01:40:52.620 --> 01:40:54.940]   There are people, there are racists, okay?
[01:40:54.940 --> 01:40:58.060]   There are black racists, that is black people
[01:40:58.060 --> 01:40:59.740]   who see somebody who's white
[01:40:59.740 --> 01:41:02.460]   and who then invoke a whole lot of stereotypes
[01:41:02.460 --> 01:41:07.460]   or whatever, or have a visceral dislike
[01:41:07.460 --> 01:41:11.220]   based upon nothing other than the color of the person's skin
[01:41:11.220 --> 01:41:15.180]   such people exist, racism is a real thing, et cetera.
[01:41:15.180 --> 01:41:19.620]   On the other hand, I think this throwing around
[01:41:19.620 --> 01:41:22.940]   the accusation of racism,
[01:41:22.940 --> 01:41:25.860]   a college professor is teaching a course.
[01:41:25.860 --> 01:41:29.180]   He says in the context of teaching the course
[01:41:29.180 --> 01:41:33.980]   that the under-representation of blacks
[01:41:33.980 --> 01:41:38.180]   in physics program at this university
[01:41:38.180 --> 01:41:42.020]   is because they score lower on the test than other groups
[01:41:42.020 --> 01:41:44.500]   and they're not qualified.
[01:41:44.500 --> 01:41:48.900]   So say the professor gives a lecture and he says,
[01:41:48.900 --> 01:41:50.820]   we don't have more blacks in the physics department
[01:41:50.820 --> 01:41:52.500]   at this university because there are not enough
[01:41:52.500 --> 01:41:54.340]   qualified blacks.
[01:41:54.340 --> 01:41:57.300]   Somebody in the classroom who hears that,
[01:41:57.300 --> 01:42:01.980]   a black student objects, he's a racist, okay?
[01:42:01.980 --> 01:42:04.660]   That's a power move.
[01:42:04.660 --> 01:42:10.180]   It's a move to try to control the conversation.
[01:42:10.180 --> 01:42:12.900]   It's not an argument, it's an epithet.
[01:42:13.900 --> 01:42:16.700]   You've said that a person who has a particular idea
[01:42:16.700 --> 01:42:18.620]   that you don't like, maybe that idea is
[01:42:18.620 --> 01:42:21.380]   I'm against affirmative action, I think it's unfair.
[01:42:21.380 --> 01:42:23.940]   I was just with Dorian Abbott.
[01:42:23.940 --> 01:42:29.780]   Dorian Abbott is a scientist at the University of Chicago
[01:42:29.780 --> 01:42:34.020]   who published a piece in Newsweek magazine
[01:42:34.020 --> 01:42:36.780]   in which he said that he thought affirmative action
[01:42:36.780 --> 01:42:41.260]   and racial balancing was unethical.
[01:42:42.740 --> 01:42:44.860]   He was invited to give a lecture at MIT,
[01:42:44.860 --> 01:42:46.620]   a very distinguished lecture in his field
[01:42:46.620 --> 01:42:49.340]   based on planetary science.
[01:42:49.340 --> 01:42:51.540]   I don't know exactly what it is.
[01:42:51.540 --> 01:42:52.880]   I'm not a scientist.
[01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:57.460]   But in any case, because he had said
[01:42:57.460 --> 01:42:59.980]   that he didn't like affirmative action
[01:42:59.980 --> 01:43:01.780]   and he thought affirmative action was racist,
[01:43:01.780 --> 01:43:02.860]   that's basically what he said.
[01:43:02.860 --> 01:43:05.300]   Why are we looking at people based upon their race
[01:43:05.300 --> 01:43:07.420]   and decide we should just do it on the merit?
[01:43:07.420 --> 01:43:09.140]   That was his position.
[01:43:09.140 --> 01:43:12.340]   Now, people protesting at the university
[01:43:12.340 --> 01:43:16.060]   where he was invited, MIT, saying that he's a racist
[01:43:16.060 --> 01:43:17.620]   because he had that opinion.
[01:43:17.620 --> 01:43:19.100]   He gets disinvited.
[01:43:19.100 --> 01:43:26.340]   Charles Murray is a popular social science writer
[01:43:26.340 --> 01:43:31.980]   who is famous for his book about IQ, "The Bell Curve,"
[01:43:31.980 --> 01:43:36.660]   one chapter of which chronicles the racial differences
[01:43:36.660 --> 01:43:39.420]   between black and white in performance
[01:43:39.420 --> 01:43:42.980]   on mental ability tests and speculates
[01:43:42.980 --> 01:43:44.940]   about the extent to which such differences
[01:43:44.940 --> 01:43:48.260]   may be connected with the genetic inheritance
[01:43:48.260 --> 01:43:51.020]   of these racially distinct populations.
[01:43:51.020 --> 01:43:53.860]   Now, he could be wrong about everything that he's saying.
[01:43:53.860 --> 01:43:57.180]   The Southern Poverty Law Center
[01:43:57.180 --> 01:43:59.700]   calls him a white supremacist
[01:43:59.700 --> 01:44:04.700]   because he observes that there are racial differences
[01:44:04.700 --> 01:44:08.580]   in measured intellectual ability
[01:44:08.580 --> 01:44:11.340]   amongst Americans of different racial descent.
[01:44:11.340 --> 01:44:14.700]   He could be wrong.
[01:44:14.700 --> 01:44:16.140]   Let me stipulate that he is wrong.
[01:44:16.140 --> 01:44:18.500]   I mean, I don't wanna argue about whether he's right
[01:44:18.500 --> 01:44:20.540]   or about whether he's wrong.
[01:44:20.540 --> 01:44:24.620]   He's addressing himself to a factual issue.
[01:44:24.620 --> 01:44:26.340]   And now the issue becomes,
[01:44:26.340 --> 01:44:29.900]   instead of grappling with the factual questions at hand
[01:44:29.900 --> 01:44:32.140]   and demonstrating his rightness or wrongness
[01:44:32.140 --> 01:44:35.740]   about those questions, the issue becomes his character.
[01:44:35.740 --> 01:44:36.980]   He's a racist.
[01:44:37.980 --> 01:44:42.980]   That's, in my mind, a lot like calling him a witch.
[01:44:42.980 --> 01:44:48.060]   The use of that word now, I think,
[01:44:48.060 --> 01:44:53.060]   has parallels to accusing people of witchcraft
[01:44:53.060 --> 01:44:56.860]   because they have views about substantive questions
[01:44:56.860 --> 01:45:01.100]   that bear on racial inequality or racial difference
[01:45:01.100 --> 01:45:04.060]   that a person finds unacceptable
[01:45:04.060 --> 01:45:05.380]   or that a person disagrees with.
[01:45:05.380 --> 01:45:07.500]   And you think you can shut somebody up.
[01:45:07.500 --> 01:45:13.860]   Crime in the cities of Chicago, St. Louis,
[01:45:13.860 --> 01:45:19.260]   Baltimore, Philadelphia, Washington, DC is out of control,
[01:45:19.260 --> 01:45:20.940]   some person might say.
[01:45:20.940 --> 01:45:22.580]   Murder rate is high.
[01:45:22.580 --> 01:45:23.980]   Who's committing those crimes?
[01:45:23.980 --> 01:45:26.380]   They're mostly black young men
[01:45:26.380 --> 01:45:28.340]   who are doing the carjackings
[01:45:28.340 --> 01:45:29.460]   and who are doing the shootings.
[01:45:29.460 --> 01:45:30.700]   They're killing each other.
[01:45:30.700 --> 01:45:33.220]   They're making our city unlivable.
[01:45:33.220 --> 01:45:36.860]   Now, that's a hypothetical statement that I offer.
[01:45:36.860 --> 01:45:39.540]   It might be correct.
[01:45:39.540 --> 01:45:41.580]   It might be incorrect.
[01:45:41.580 --> 01:45:43.140]   It might be appropriate.
[01:45:43.140 --> 01:45:44.340]   It might be inappropriate.
[01:45:44.340 --> 01:45:47.820]   It may be true, but something that we would be better off
[01:45:47.820 --> 01:45:50.220]   if people didn't focus on, I don't know.
[01:45:50.220 --> 01:45:54.300]   Responding to someone making that statement,
[01:45:54.300 --> 01:45:57.380]   have you seen what has happened to my city?
[01:45:57.380 --> 01:46:00.140]   It used to be that you could go to North Michigan Avenue
[01:46:00.140 --> 01:46:02.140]   and you could find one after another,
[01:46:02.140 --> 01:46:03.380]   after another high-end shop.
[01:46:03.380 --> 01:46:05.780]   This is in Chicago, my hometown.
[01:46:05.780 --> 01:46:09.380]   And tourists would come and they'd go to the theater
[01:46:09.380 --> 01:46:11.300]   and there were restaurants and they'd go out.
[01:46:11.300 --> 01:46:12.500]   They don't do it anymore.
[01:46:12.500 --> 01:46:13.340]   You know what?
[01:46:13.340 --> 01:46:14.460]   Half of those stores are boarded up now.
[01:46:14.460 --> 01:46:15.580]   You know why?
[01:46:15.580 --> 01:46:17.820]   Because when George Floyd was killed,
[01:46:17.820 --> 01:46:21.140]   black people mobbed in the city
[01:46:21.140 --> 01:46:23.420]   and they burnt and they rioted and they looted.
[01:46:23.420 --> 01:46:25.220]   And it hasn't been the same ever since.
[01:46:25.220 --> 01:46:27.060]   And I'm moving to the suburbs.
[01:46:27.060 --> 01:46:29.060]   I'll be damned if I'm gonna send my children
[01:46:29.060 --> 01:46:29.900]   to those schools.
[01:46:29.900 --> 01:46:31.500]   A person could say that.
[01:46:31.500 --> 01:46:33.500]   They might be right, they might be wrong to say it.
[01:46:33.500 --> 01:46:36.260]   Calling them a racist is exactly not
[01:46:36.260 --> 01:46:39.020]   a rebuttal of what they said.
[01:46:39.020 --> 01:46:39.980]   It's a move.
[01:46:39.980 --> 01:46:43.540]   It's a move to try to take control of the conversation
[01:46:43.540 --> 01:46:45.820]   by accusing someone of having bad character
[01:46:45.820 --> 01:46:48.260]   because they said something that made you uncomfortable,
[01:46:48.260 --> 01:46:49.660]   which you can't deal with.
[01:46:49.660 --> 01:46:52.820]   So you think you can shut them up by calling them a racist.
[01:46:52.820 --> 01:46:55.100]   You might as well be calling them a witch.
[01:46:55.100 --> 01:46:57.180]   You might as well be calling for their head on a platter
[01:46:57.180 --> 01:47:00.180]   because they believe that Satan is Lord,
[01:47:00.180 --> 01:47:03.980]   because that's the kind of quote, argument,
[01:47:03.980 --> 01:47:06.380]   close quote, which is precisely not an argument
[01:47:06.380 --> 01:47:09.820]   that people who invoke that term are using.
[01:47:09.820 --> 01:47:12.180]   And here's what I have to say about that.
[01:47:12.180 --> 01:47:17.180]   It's a fool's errand to try to refute somebody
[01:47:17.180 --> 01:47:18.580]   by calling them a witch.
[01:47:18.580 --> 01:47:23.180]   Likewise, it's a fool's errand to try to rebut
[01:47:23.180 --> 01:47:26.300]   the contrary forces in American politics
[01:47:26.300 --> 01:47:29.420]   that are a reaction often to real things
[01:47:29.420 --> 01:47:31.540]   that are going on on the ground in black communities
[01:47:31.540 --> 01:47:33.460]   in the cities across this country
[01:47:33.460 --> 01:47:35.420]   by calling people a racist.
[01:47:35.420 --> 01:47:39.220]   You may shut them up, but you won't change their minds.
[01:47:39.220 --> 01:47:40.060]   And you know what?
[01:47:40.060 --> 01:47:41.780]   At the end of the day, they're gonna go to the ballot box
[01:47:41.780 --> 01:47:43.100]   and they're gonna vote.
[01:47:43.100 --> 01:47:45.460]   They're gonna pick up their store
[01:47:45.460 --> 01:47:47.620]   and they're gonna move it to the other side of town
[01:47:47.620 --> 01:47:49.740]   or to another town altogether.
[01:47:49.740 --> 01:47:51.980]   They're gonna keep their children away
[01:47:51.980 --> 01:47:53.860]   from places where they think the influences
[01:47:53.860 --> 01:47:55.980]   are harmful to those children.
[01:47:55.980 --> 01:47:58.660]   They may not even talk about it in public.
[01:47:58.660 --> 01:48:00.180]   You can believe that in private
[01:48:00.180 --> 01:48:02.540]   that they're talking about it with each other.
[01:48:02.540 --> 01:48:05.420]   You had better find a more effective way
[01:48:05.420 --> 01:48:07.620]   of dealing with the conflicts in this country
[01:48:07.620 --> 01:48:09.860]   that fall along racial fault lines
[01:48:09.860 --> 01:48:11.700]   than calling people witches,
[01:48:11.700 --> 01:48:16.020]   which is what this, you know, anti-racist.
[01:48:16.020 --> 01:48:18.100]   You're a racist because you think that
[01:48:18.100 --> 01:48:20.260]   they oughta wed like birthright amongst black Americans.
[01:48:20.260 --> 01:48:21.980]   The seven babies out of 10 are born
[01:48:21.980 --> 01:48:23.700]   to a woman without a husband.
[01:48:23.700 --> 01:48:25.260]   Their families are falling apart.
[01:48:25.260 --> 01:48:26.460]   Now, no one says that in public
[01:48:26.460 --> 01:48:27.780]   because they'd be called a racist
[01:48:27.780 --> 01:48:29.100]   if they said it in public.
[01:48:29.100 --> 01:48:32.420]   But as a matter of fact, the families are falling apart.
[01:48:32.420 --> 01:48:33.860]   You didn't change that in the least
[01:48:33.860 --> 01:48:35.940]   by telling people to shut up about it.
[01:48:35.940 --> 01:48:38.260]   Daniel Patrick Moynihan is called a racist
[01:48:38.260 --> 01:48:40.660]   in the 1960s, the late senator,
[01:48:40.660 --> 01:48:43.900]   the late New York senator who was a federal employee
[01:48:43.900 --> 01:48:45.620]   and an intellectual writing reports.
[01:48:45.620 --> 01:48:47.540]   And he writes a report about the Negro family,
[01:48:47.540 --> 01:48:48.980]   he called it in those years.
[01:48:48.980 --> 01:48:50.100]   If I use the word Negro,
[01:48:50.100 --> 01:48:52.260]   now they're gonna call me a racist if I'm a white person.
[01:48:52.260 --> 01:48:54.220]   I can't even use the word Negro,
[01:48:54.220 --> 01:48:57.620]   which is a historically legitimate reference
[01:48:57.620 --> 01:49:00.820]   to the descendants of the slaves,
[01:49:00.820 --> 01:49:03.420]   enslaved people, which we were, as black Americans,
[01:49:03.420 --> 01:49:05.460]   proud to use until yesterday.
[01:49:05.460 --> 01:49:09.060]   So all of this linguistic policing
[01:49:09.060 --> 01:49:12.100]   is a sign of weakness.
[01:49:12.100 --> 01:49:15.500]   It's false black power.
[01:49:15.500 --> 01:49:17.140]   People will cede you the ground.
[01:49:17.140 --> 01:49:18.380]   Okay, you don't want me to use that word,
[01:49:18.380 --> 01:49:19.420]   I won't use that word anymore.
[01:49:19.420 --> 01:49:21.260]   Okay, you don't want me to talk about that in public?
[01:49:21.260 --> 01:49:23.580]   All right, I won't talk about it in public anymore.
[01:49:23.580 --> 01:49:25.020]   I don't wanna be called a racist, okay,
[01:49:25.020 --> 01:49:26.780]   so I won't express my opinion.
[01:49:26.780 --> 01:49:28.580]   You haven't changed anybody's mind.
[01:49:28.580 --> 01:49:30.820]   You know, so--
[01:49:30.820 --> 01:49:34.540]   - And you've also mentioned that for that,
[01:49:34.540 --> 01:49:36.020]   you haven't changed anybody's mind,
[01:49:36.020 --> 01:49:40.260]   but also for things like in universities and institutions,
[01:49:40.260 --> 01:49:42.980]   there's a diversity, inclusion,
[01:49:42.980 --> 01:49:46.740]   and equity kind of meetings and education and so on.
[01:49:46.740 --> 01:49:48.540]   And I believe I read somewhere,
[01:49:48.540 --> 01:49:51.020]   I've been, like I mentioned to you offline,
[01:49:51.020 --> 01:49:55.100]   big fan of your Glenn show, people should listen to it.
[01:49:55.100 --> 01:49:55.940]   It's amazing.
[01:49:56.900 --> 01:49:59.780]   There's also just interviews of you that I've listened to.
[01:49:59.780 --> 01:50:00.820]   I believe you mentioned somewhere
[01:50:00.820 --> 01:50:02.740]   that even those kinds of meetings,
[01:50:02.740 --> 01:50:05.940]   people might sit through and nod along,
[01:50:05.940 --> 01:50:09.780]   but that doesn't necessarily mean that's making progress,
[01:50:09.780 --> 01:50:10.900]   that they may not,
[01:50:10.900 --> 01:50:15.620]   they may actually be bottling up a frustration.
[01:50:15.620 --> 01:50:17.700]   The fear is that that's going to result
[01:50:17.700 --> 01:50:22.580]   in a pendulum sort of pushback
[01:50:22.580 --> 01:50:26.060]   towards this idea of forced appreciation,
[01:50:26.060 --> 01:50:30.980]   like forced anti-racism kind of thing.
[01:50:30.980 --> 01:50:34.020]   - I talk about this often in my podcast,
[01:50:34.020 --> 01:50:35.340]   that's the Glenn show, you know,
[01:50:35.340 --> 01:50:38.700]   and you can find the Glenn show on my YouTube channel
[01:50:38.700 --> 01:50:39.980]   and also at Substack.
[01:50:39.980 --> 01:50:42.740]   - Yeah, you have a great Substack.
[01:50:42.740 --> 01:50:44.900]   You and your friend do Q&As
[01:50:44.900 --> 01:50:46.780]   and all that kind of stuff on Patreon.
[01:50:46.780 --> 01:50:47.620]   - Yeah.
[01:50:47.620 --> 01:50:49.620]   - So yeah, so people should definitely follow you.
[01:50:49.620 --> 01:50:51.420]   It's a brilliant conversation. - Check us out.
[01:50:51.420 --> 01:50:53.860]   - But yeah, I mean, one concern is that
[01:50:53.860 --> 01:50:58.780]   the superficial policing,
[01:50:58.780 --> 01:51:00.340]   this is a part of political correctness,
[01:51:00.340 --> 01:51:02.700]   you know, the insistence that you only use certain words,
[01:51:02.700 --> 01:51:04.460]   that you only talk in a certain way,
[01:51:04.460 --> 01:51:06.860]   is a phony kind of power
[01:51:06.860 --> 01:51:08.620]   because it doesn't actually persuade people
[01:51:08.620 --> 01:51:10.700]   about the issues that are at hand.
[01:51:10.700 --> 01:51:13.340]   Instead, it forces them underground
[01:51:13.340 --> 01:51:15.420]   in their talk about these issues,
[01:51:15.420 --> 01:51:19.180]   and that's problematic.
[01:51:19.180 --> 01:51:23.460]   Much better that we have overt and explicit
[01:51:23.460 --> 01:51:25.900]   and honest disagreement,
[01:51:25.900 --> 01:51:28.300]   to the extent that there are disagreement
[01:51:28.300 --> 01:51:30.180]   about things that are going on,
[01:51:30.180 --> 01:51:33.660]   than that we have a superficial kind of,
[01:51:33.660 --> 01:51:39.860]   you know, a conversation that is purged
[01:51:39.860 --> 01:51:42.980]   of any real biting,
[01:51:42.980 --> 01:51:47.220]   you know, discomforting confrontation
[01:51:47.220 --> 01:51:49.900]   with the realities of the situation at hand.
[01:51:49.900 --> 01:51:52.180]   And for black Americans, I think one big part
[01:51:52.180 --> 01:51:54.620]   of the reality of the situation at hand
[01:51:54.620 --> 01:51:58.020]   is violent crime, violent crime.
[01:51:58.020 --> 01:52:01.180]   You know, a police officer is afraid when he stops a car
[01:52:01.180 --> 01:52:04.180]   because it's an 18 year old driver in the vehicle.
[01:52:04.180 --> 01:52:06.820]   He's got dreadlocks, he's a black person,
[01:52:06.820 --> 01:52:09.340]   the car doesn't have the right license plate.
[01:52:09.340 --> 01:52:12.300]   He's afraid to deal with that person.
[01:52:12.300 --> 01:52:13.900]   And one of the reasons he's afraid to deal with them
[01:52:13.900 --> 01:52:16.620]   is because a few who look like him
[01:52:16.620 --> 01:52:18.300]   are behaving violently.
[01:52:18.300 --> 01:52:20.620]   Their violence is usually perpetrated against others
[01:52:20.620 --> 01:52:23.540]   who look like themselves, but not always.
[01:52:23.540 --> 01:52:28.140]   And that reality doesn't get changed by,
[01:52:28.140 --> 01:52:32.540]   you know, telling a newspaper writer who writes about it
[01:52:32.540 --> 01:52:36.340]   that they are a racist, or enforcing within a newsroom,
[01:52:36.340 --> 01:52:38.340]   you can't cover that story in that way
[01:52:38.340 --> 01:52:41.460]   because to do so would be racist.
[01:52:41.460 --> 01:52:45.900]   I think it's a monumental mistake.
[01:52:46.740 --> 01:52:51.740]   To enforce a closure on public discussion
[01:52:51.740 --> 01:52:55.980]   based upon a calculation that if we allow people,
[01:52:55.980 --> 01:52:58.820]   if Twitter allows this kind of post,
[01:52:58.820 --> 01:53:03.780]   if the Washington Post runs this kind of story, et cetera,
[01:53:03.780 --> 01:53:08.780]   you end up with a superficial politeness,
[01:53:12.700 --> 01:53:17.420]   but a subterranean, seething resentment
[01:53:17.420 --> 01:53:19.580]   that only makes matters worse.
[01:53:19.580 --> 01:53:24.500]   - If I can get your comment, maybe you have ideas,
[01:53:24.500 --> 01:53:29.500]   because it does seem that this kind of attack works,
[01:53:29.500 --> 01:53:35.140]   of being called a racist, being called,
[01:53:35.140 --> 01:53:40.260]   maybe not sexist, but somebody, you know,
[01:53:40.260 --> 01:53:44.260]   like we're going through a Johnny Depp trial now, right?
[01:53:44.260 --> 01:53:46.620]   It's a defamation trial, and the reason
[01:53:46.620 --> 01:53:48.420]   it's a defamation trial is because
[01:53:48.420 --> 01:53:51.420]   all it took is a single accusation of Johnny Depp
[01:53:51.420 --> 01:53:56.420]   being somebody who sexually and physically abused Amber Heard
[01:53:56.420 --> 01:53:59.460]   and all it took is just a single article.
[01:53:59.460 --> 01:54:04.460]   No proof was given except the accusation itself,
[01:54:04.460 --> 01:54:06.780]   and the world believed it.
[01:54:06.780 --> 01:54:09.580]   So it's effective.
[01:54:09.580 --> 01:54:13.140]   So how do you fight back if it's so damn effective
[01:54:13.140 --> 01:54:15.340]   that you can just call anybody racist?
[01:54:15.340 --> 01:54:16.980]   And it works.
[01:54:16.980 --> 01:54:18.260]   It's hard to wash off.
[01:54:18.260 --> 01:54:24.700]   It's, you're, you know, you're not proven
[01:54:24.700 --> 01:54:28.660]   in the court of law or anything like that,
[01:54:28.660 --> 01:54:33.580]   but we get those articles, we get that label,
[01:54:33.580 --> 01:54:34.980]   and then the world moves on
[01:54:34.980 --> 01:54:37.300]   and just assumes that person is racist.
[01:54:37.300 --> 01:54:40.980]   So how do you, do you have any ideas how to fight back?
[01:54:40.980 --> 01:54:42.220]   No, I don't, frankly.
[01:54:42.220 --> 01:54:44.620]   Just highlighting the fact.
[01:54:44.620 --> 01:54:46.700]   Listen, Roseanne Barr, who made this statement
[01:54:46.700 --> 01:54:49.660]   about Valerie Jarrett, she made some kind of ape-like
[01:54:49.660 --> 01:54:52.380]   reference to the whatever, and her show got canceled,
[01:54:52.380 --> 01:54:54.740]   and she's a racist.
[01:54:54.740 --> 01:54:56.900]   So first of all, pointing it out, I suppose,
[01:54:56.900 --> 01:54:58.300]   is one of the most powerful things,
[01:54:58.300 --> 01:55:03.060]   that the hypocrisy of it, the...
[01:55:03.060 --> 01:55:05.500]   You say it works.
[01:55:05.500 --> 01:55:06.740]   I guess you're right.
[01:55:06.740 --> 01:55:09.980]   It used to be that calling someone a communist worked.
[01:55:09.980 --> 01:55:13.860]   I mean, going back to the late '40s, early '50s,
[01:55:13.860 --> 01:55:18.060]   Red Scare, McCarthyism, and whatnot,
[01:55:18.060 --> 01:55:21.860]   and the person might've belonged to a club
[01:55:21.860 --> 01:55:24.740]   that was pro-Soviet Union in the 1930s
[01:55:24.740 --> 01:55:25.900]   when they were in college.
[01:55:25.900 --> 01:55:28.140]   They might've voted for the socialist candidate,
[01:55:28.140 --> 01:55:31.940]   Henry Wallace, in the presidential election of 1948.
[01:55:31.940 --> 01:55:33.900]   They might belong to the Communist Party.
[01:55:33.900 --> 01:55:37.260]   They might think Karl Marx was right about a whole lot
[01:55:37.260 --> 01:55:39.540]   of stuff about capitalism and whatnot,
[01:55:39.540 --> 01:55:42.340]   and they got called a communist or a Marxist,
[01:55:42.340 --> 01:55:43.860]   and it could've ruined their career,
[01:55:43.860 --> 01:55:45.300]   could've ruined their lives.
[01:55:45.300 --> 01:55:49.580]   And a lot of people shut up about it,
[01:55:49.580 --> 01:55:51.860]   and it went on for a long time,
[01:55:51.860 --> 01:55:56.860]   and in a way, it kind of still is going on.
[01:55:56.860 --> 01:55:58.420]   I mean, you call somebody a Marxist,
[01:55:58.420 --> 01:56:00.460]   if you can make that stick,
[01:56:00.460 --> 01:56:02.340]   they're certainly not gonna get elected president
[01:56:02.340 --> 01:56:03.500]   of the United States.
[01:56:04.500 --> 01:56:06.260]   But I don't know about this.
[01:56:06.260 --> 01:56:10.700]   I think, you know, I once read this book
[01:56:10.700 --> 01:56:13.780]   by a German political scientist
[01:56:13.780 --> 01:56:16.780]   called Elisabeth Neule Neumann.
[01:56:16.780 --> 01:56:21.780]   That was the writer's name, Elisabeth Neule Neumann.
[01:56:21.780 --> 01:56:24.580]   The book was called "The Spiral of Silence,"
[01:56:24.580 --> 01:56:30.060]   and the argument was there can be some views,
[01:56:30.060 --> 01:56:34.580]   some issues in society that get defined in such a way
[01:56:34.580 --> 01:56:37.300]   that it's inappropriate to hold those views.
[01:56:37.300 --> 01:56:40.940]   And as a result, people who don't wanna be shamed,
[01:56:40.940 --> 01:56:45.940]   who don't wanna be ostracized, don't express those views.
[01:56:45.940 --> 01:56:47.500]   And when they don't express them,
[01:56:47.500 --> 01:56:48.740]   anybody holding the view,
[01:56:48.740 --> 01:56:50.860]   because they don't hear it said by others,
[01:56:50.860 --> 01:56:51.980]   think that they're the only one
[01:56:51.980 --> 01:56:54.260]   or one of the few who hold the view,
[01:56:54.260 --> 01:56:56.700]   and so they don't wanna be the only one out there
[01:56:56.700 --> 01:56:59.260]   saying something, so they keep it to themselves.
[01:56:59.260 --> 01:57:02.900]   So now this view, this attitude in society
[01:57:02.900 --> 01:57:06.540]   could be held by a large number of people,
[01:57:06.540 --> 01:57:11.540]   but because of the fear that if they were to express it,
[01:57:11.540 --> 01:57:14.940]   they'd be ostracized, no one says it.
[01:57:14.940 --> 01:57:16.700]   And since no one is saying it,
[01:57:16.700 --> 01:57:18.860]   the others who hold the view don't know
[01:57:18.860 --> 01:57:20.100]   that they're not alone,
[01:57:20.100 --> 01:57:24.340]   that they are not the only ones who hold the view,
[01:57:24.340 --> 01:57:25.620]   and hence they keep silent.
[01:57:25.620 --> 01:57:26.660]   That could be an equilibrium.
[01:57:26.740 --> 01:57:29.540]   It could be a relatively stable situation
[01:57:29.540 --> 01:57:32.020]   in which the emperor has no clothes,
[01:57:32.020 --> 01:57:36.660]   everybody can see that this dude is naked, okay?
[01:57:36.660 --> 01:57:39.220]   But everybody thinks that, you know,
[01:57:39.220 --> 01:57:41.100]   I don't wanna be the only one to say it.
[01:57:41.100 --> 01:57:44.740]   And so we all kind of collaborate in this charade
[01:57:44.740 --> 01:57:47.300]   of keeping the view to ourselves.
[01:57:47.300 --> 01:57:53.580]   Then along comes an event that somebody decides
[01:57:54.700 --> 01:57:59.700]   to defy the consensus and to speak out.
[01:57:59.700 --> 01:58:01.500]   It could be a little kid who,
[01:58:01.500 --> 01:58:03.300]   in the story about the emperor has no clothes,
[01:58:03.300 --> 01:58:05.960]   doesn't realize that he's not supposed to say
[01:58:05.960 --> 01:58:07.980]   that the emperor is naked.
[01:58:07.980 --> 01:58:10.020]   The thing about the kid in the story
[01:58:10.020 --> 01:58:11.340]   who says that the emperor is naked
[01:58:11.340 --> 01:58:12.800]   is not that he's saying it,
[01:58:12.800 --> 01:58:17.540]   it's not even that other people hear him saying it,
[01:58:17.540 --> 01:58:19.180]   it's that everybody knows
[01:58:19.180 --> 01:58:23.020]   that everybody else heard him say it, okay?
[01:58:23.020 --> 01:58:27.100]   The kid who speaks out and says the emperor has no clothes
[01:58:27.100 --> 01:58:30.100]   creates a circumstance in which it's common knowledge
[01:58:30.100 --> 01:58:31.340]   that the emperor has no clothes.
[01:58:31.340 --> 01:58:34.020]   Now, common knowledge does not just mean knowledge.
[01:58:34.020 --> 01:58:36.500]   It does not even mean widespread knowledge.
[01:58:36.500 --> 01:58:38.500]   It means comprehensive knowledge
[01:58:38.500 --> 01:58:42.540]   of other person's knowledge of the thing, okay?
[01:58:42.540 --> 01:58:46.020]   So the spiral of silence is a equilibrium
[01:58:46.020 --> 01:58:48.740]   that is susceptible to being undermined
[01:58:49.820 --> 01:58:53.820]   by a process of a kind of cumulative process,
[01:58:53.820 --> 01:58:56.300]   a snowballing process of revelation
[01:58:56.300 --> 01:59:00.260]   that you're not the only one who thinks this way, okay?
[01:59:00.260 --> 01:59:02.260]   - It's fascinating to think that there's an ocean
[01:59:02.260 --> 01:59:05.620]   of common knowledge that we're waiting for the little kid
[01:59:05.620 --> 01:59:09.000]   to wake us up to, different little parts of it.
[01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:10.780]   - That's correct, and the little kid, by the way,
[01:59:10.780 --> 01:59:12.620]   could be somebody like Donald Trump,
[01:59:12.620 --> 01:59:15.220]   only more effective than Donald Trump.
[01:59:15.220 --> 01:59:17.300]   Somebody who is smarter than Donald Trump,
[01:59:17.300 --> 01:59:20.180]   somebody who is shrewder than Donald Trump,
[01:59:20.180 --> 01:59:25.700]   somebody who figures out that when Colin Kaepernick
[01:59:25.700 --> 01:59:29.140]   takes a knee at a football game and says,
[01:59:29.140 --> 01:59:31.420]   "I'm not gonna stand for this president's allegiance,"
[01:59:31.420 --> 01:59:36.420]   that a vast number of people are very unhappy about that.
[01:59:36.420 --> 01:59:42.220]   Somebody who understands that when a Black Lives Matter
[01:59:42.220 --> 01:59:44.980]   activist stands up with his ball fist and says,
[01:59:44.980 --> 01:59:47.500]   "Burn this bitch down," about a city
[01:59:47.500 --> 01:59:49.780]   in the United States of America,
[01:59:49.780 --> 01:59:52.660]   that a lot of people are upset about that, a lot of them.
[01:59:52.660 --> 01:59:55.860]   A person, a shrewd politician,
[01:59:55.860 --> 01:59:59.700]   a shrewd manager of public image
[01:59:59.700 --> 02:00:03.940]   could build on and create a circumstance
[02:00:03.940 --> 02:00:06.620]   in which more and more people will feel safe
[02:00:06.620 --> 02:00:10.220]   to express that view, and the more who express it,
[02:00:10.220 --> 02:00:12.020]   the safer those who have yet to express it,
[02:00:12.020 --> 02:00:14.980]   but who hold it, will feel in expressing it.
[02:00:14.980 --> 02:00:18.060]   And to the extent that the view is very widespread,
[02:00:18.060 --> 02:00:22.020]   but is kept under wraps, an explosion could happen.
[02:00:22.020 --> 02:00:23.020]   And you could look up at tomorrow
[02:00:23.020 --> 02:00:26.340]   and have a very different country than you had today
[02:00:26.340 --> 02:00:31.340]   because the conspiracy of silence, the spiral of silence,
[02:00:31.340 --> 02:00:35.780]   ends up getting unraveled by somebody who steps out
[02:00:35.780 --> 02:00:39.180]   away from the consensus, dares to take the slings and arrows
[02:00:39.180 --> 02:00:41.780]   of exposing themselves as a naysayer,
[02:00:41.780 --> 02:00:45.860]   but taps into a sentiment that's very widespread.
[02:00:45.860 --> 02:00:50.500]   And I fear that with respect to many racial issues,
[02:00:50.500 --> 02:00:53.940]   this is the situation that we actually confront,
[02:00:53.940 --> 02:00:57.220]   that it could unravel in a very ugly way.
[02:00:57.220 --> 02:01:00.100]   - But it could also unravel in a beautiful way.
[02:01:00.100 --> 02:01:02.260]   So it's depending.
[02:01:02.260 --> 02:01:04.340]   There is a spiral of silence, you're saying,
[02:01:04.340 --> 02:01:07.820]   and it could be, 'cause speaking of children,
[02:01:07.820 --> 02:01:11.700]   charismatic children, there's a guy named Elon Musk.
[02:01:11.700 --> 02:01:12.540]   (Lex laughing)
[02:01:12.540 --> 02:01:16.860]   Who might be a candidate for such an unraveling, right?
[02:01:16.860 --> 02:01:20.060]   You mentioned the person that speaks out
[02:01:20.060 --> 02:01:23.380]   could be a Donald Trump, but in this current situation
[02:01:23.380 --> 02:01:25.820]   that we live in, like as this week,
[02:01:25.820 --> 02:01:28.260]   Elon has purchased Twitter.
[02:01:28.260 --> 02:01:29.420]   - That's what I hear.
[02:01:29.420 --> 02:01:34.300]   - And is pushing for, in all kinds of ways,
[02:01:34.300 --> 02:01:37.460]   the increase of free speech on Twitter.
[02:01:37.460 --> 02:01:40.480]   And speaking about some of the issues
[02:01:40.480 --> 02:01:44.540]   that we've been speaking about here with you,
[02:01:44.540 --> 02:01:46.380]   but maybe in broader strokes,
[02:01:46.380 --> 02:01:49.260]   about just the fact that you have to,
[02:01:49.260 --> 02:01:52.900]   it's okay to point out that the emperor wears no clothes
[02:01:52.900 --> 02:01:55.940]   and to do so from all sides in a way
[02:01:55.940 --> 02:01:58.900]   that everybody's a little bit pissed off, but not too much.
[02:01:58.900 --> 02:02:02.660]   What do you think about this whole effort of free speech
[02:02:02.660 --> 02:02:06.020]   in these public platforms?
[02:02:06.020 --> 02:02:10.260]   Elon in particular, Twitter, you're a avid Twitter user,
[02:02:10.260 --> 02:02:14.320]   but just public platforms for discourse
[02:02:14.320 --> 02:02:18.840]   for us as a civilization to figure stuff out.
[02:02:18.840 --> 02:02:22.560]   - Yeah, well, the people on the left are very upset
[02:02:22.560 --> 02:02:26.560]   about the possibility that Elon Musk and Twitter
[02:02:26.560 --> 02:02:31.560]   will be more open to provocative public speech
[02:02:33.160 --> 02:02:37.300]   that has heretofore been banned or suppressed.
[02:02:37.300 --> 02:02:41.500]   And I think they might be right to be concerned
[02:02:41.500 --> 02:02:42.980]   that that could happen.
[02:02:42.980 --> 02:02:45.260]   I don't know enough about the technology
[02:02:45.260 --> 02:02:47.660]   and about the market to really,
[02:02:47.660 --> 02:02:50.420]   social media and whatnot,
[02:02:50.420 --> 02:02:54.500]   it seems like it's a complicated system of interactions
[02:02:54.500 --> 02:02:56.340]   between people and who the users are
[02:02:56.340 --> 02:02:57.540]   and so forth and so on.
[02:02:57.540 --> 02:03:02.460]   I do know that that New York Post story
[02:03:02.460 --> 02:03:06.300]   about Hunter Biden's laptop was real news
[02:03:06.300 --> 02:03:08.900]   and could have affected the outcome of the election
[02:03:08.900 --> 02:03:10.500]   and it was suppressed
[02:03:10.500 --> 02:03:14.340]   and that Twitter had a role in suppressing it.
[02:03:14.340 --> 02:03:16.700]   I do know that the question
[02:03:16.700 --> 02:03:19.100]   of where the COVID-19 virus originated
[02:03:19.100 --> 02:03:22.940]   in the role that a lab leak account could have played
[02:03:22.940 --> 02:03:27.860]   in the public processing of that event was real news
[02:03:27.860 --> 02:03:29.820]   and that it was suppressed by people
[02:03:29.820 --> 02:03:33.780]   who were trying to control misinformation, disinformation,
[02:03:33.780 --> 02:03:36.900]   Russian disinformation campaigns and whatnot.
[02:03:36.900 --> 02:03:40.780]   So Twitter has users, I'm one of them
[02:03:40.780 --> 02:03:42.120]   and it has a lot of users.
[02:03:42.120 --> 02:03:44.900]   It's not as big as Facebook, I gather, it's not,
[02:03:44.900 --> 02:03:49.780]   but it's important, the ability to construct
[02:03:49.780 --> 02:03:53.660]   counter platforms where people moving around and whatnot.
[02:03:53.660 --> 02:03:56.460]   It's a kind of network dynamic
[02:03:56.460 --> 02:03:58.500]   that maybe I should understand it better than I do
[02:03:58.500 --> 02:04:00.260]   being a social scientist, but--
[02:04:00.260 --> 02:04:01.820]   - I don't think anyone understands it,
[02:04:01.820 --> 02:04:05.460]   even people inside Twitter, which is fascinating.
[02:04:05.460 --> 02:04:09.500]   It's a monster because of just the bandwidth of messaging
[02:04:09.500 --> 02:04:12.660]   and you don't know who is a bot and who is a human.
[02:04:12.660 --> 02:04:14.300]   That's a fascinating dynamic.
[02:04:14.300 --> 02:04:19.100]   And the viral nature of negativity.
[02:04:19.100 --> 02:04:22.800]   All of those dynamics, of course,
[02:04:22.800 --> 02:04:25.700]   you are probably the right person to understand it
[02:04:25.700 --> 02:04:28.100]   from a social scientist perspective,
[02:04:28.100 --> 02:04:29.980]   from an economics perspective,
[02:04:29.980 --> 02:04:31.860]   but nobody really understands.
[02:04:31.860 --> 02:04:34.780]   And it's fascinating within that domain,
[02:04:34.780 --> 02:04:38.900]   how do you allow for free speech,
[02:04:38.900 --> 02:04:41.520]   not allow for free speech, encourage free speech,
[02:04:41.520 --> 02:04:45.300]   defend free speech, and at the same time,
[02:04:45.300 --> 02:04:49.260]   manage millions of ongoing conversations
[02:04:49.260 --> 02:04:54.260]   from just becoming insanely chaotic.
[02:04:56.340 --> 02:04:58.660]   Sort of from Twitter perspective,
[02:04:58.660 --> 02:05:02.020]   they want people to be happy, to grow,
[02:05:02.020 --> 02:05:05.420]   to actually have difficult, critical conversations.
[02:05:05.420 --> 02:05:07.580]   And the problem with humans
[02:05:07.580 --> 02:05:09.900]   is they think they know what that is
[02:05:09.900 --> 02:05:14.300]   and they think they can label things as misinformation,
[02:05:14.300 --> 02:05:18.780]   as counterproductive for healthy conversations, in quotes.
[02:05:18.780 --> 02:05:22.100]   And the problem is, as we are learning,
[02:05:22.100 --> 02:05:25.280]   humans are not able to do that effectively.
[02:05:25.280 --> 02:05:27.780]   First of all, power corrupts.
[02:05:27.780 --> 02:05:30.920]   There's something delicious about having the power
[02:05:30.920 --> 02:05:33.180]   to label something as misinformation.
[02:05:33.180 --> 02:05:35.780]   You do that once for something
[02:05:35.780 --> 02:05:37.820]   that might be obviously misinformation,
[02:05:37.820 --> 02:05:39.780]   and then you start getting greedy.
[02:05:39.780 --> 02:05:40.940]   You start getting excited.
[02:05:40.940 --> 02:05:41.900]   It feels good.
[02:05:41.900 --> 02:05:45.940]   It feels good to label something as misinformation
[02:05:45.940 --> 02:05:48.860]   or disinformation that you just don't like.
[02:05:48.860 --> 02:05:51.020]   And over time, especially if there's a culture
[02:05:51.020 --> 02:05:55.140]   inside of a company that leans a certain political direction
[02:05:55.140 --> 02:05:57.540]   or leans, in all the groups that we talked about,
[02:05:57.540 --> 02:06:01.260]   leans a certain way, they'll start to label
[02:06:01.260 --> 02:06:03.660]   as misinformation things they just don't like.
[02:06:03.660 --> 02:06:07.540]   And that power is delicious and it corrupts.
[02:06:07.540 --> 02:06:08.980]   You have to construct mechanisms,
[02:06:08.980 --> 02:06:10.580]   like the Founding Fathers did,
[02:06:10.580 --> 02:06:14.700]   for somehow preventing you from allowing that power
[02:06:14.700 --> 02:06:15.840]   to get too delicious.
[02:06:15.840 --> 02:06:19.700]   At least that's my perspective on what's going on.
[02:06:19.700 --> 02:06:21.300]   - Well, I'll just tell you personally,
[02:06:21.300 --> 02:06:23.340]   I'm excited about the prospect.
[02:06:23.340 --> 02:06:25.860]   I'm glad to see Musk making the move that he's making,
[02:06:25.860 --> 02:06:29.100]   and we'll see what happens at Twitter and so forth.
[02:06:29.100 --> 02:06:33.180]   - You're looking forward for the, what did he say?
[02:06:33.180 --> 02:06:35.140]   Let's make Twitter more fun.
[02:06:35.140 --> 02:06:38.160]   I'm looking forward to the fun.
[02:06:38.160 --> 02:06:43.220]   You've talked about, you are at a prestigious university.
[02:06:43.220 --> 02:06:44.220]   - Brown University.
[02:06:44.220 --> 02:06:45.400]   - Brown University.
[02:06:45.400 --> 02:06:50.220]   And you've mentioned that universities might be in trouble.
[02:06:50.220 --> 02:06:52.400]   I think it's with Jordan, but everywhere else,
[02:06:52.400 --> 02:06:54.980]   the barbarians are at the gate.
[02:06:54.980 --> 02:06:59.740]   Who are the barbarians at the gate of the university?
[02:06:59.740 --> 02:07:03.540]   So first of all, what is to you beautiful
[02:07:03.540 --> 02:07:08.540]   about the ideal of the university in America, of academia?
[02:07:08.540 --> 02:07:12.100]   And what is a threat?
[02:07:12.100 --> 02:07:15.300]   - Well, you know, a university is dedicated
[02:07:15.300 --> 02:07:17.380]   to the pursuit of truth,
[02:07:18.420 --> 02:07:23.420]   and to the education and nurturing of young people
[02:07:23.420 --> 02:07:26.600]   as they enter into the pursuit of truth,
[02:07:26.600 --> 02:07:28.840]   to doing research and to teaching
[02:07:28.840 --> 02:07:34.720]   in a environment of free inquiry and civil discourse.
[02:07:34.720 --> 02:07:40.880]   So free inquiry means you go wherever the evidence
[02:07:40.880 --> 02:07:43.560]   and your imagination may lead you,
[02:07:43.560 --> 02:07:46.540]   and civil discourse means that you exchange arguments
[02:07:46.540 --> 02:07:48.180]   with people when you don't agree with them
[02:07:48.180 --> 02:07:50.680]   on behalf of trying to get to the bottom of things.
[02:07:50.680 --> 02:07:56.560]   I think the university is a magnificent institution.
[02:07:56.560 --> 02:08:00.400]   It is a relatively modern institution.
[02:08:00.400 --> 02:08:02.760]   I mean, last 500 years or so,
[02:08:02.760 --> 02:08:04.680]   I mean, there are universities that are older than that,
[02:08:04.680 --> 02:08:08.520]   but the great research universities of the world,
[02:08:08.520 --> 02:08:10.900]   not only here in the United States,
[02:08:10.900 --> 02:08:15.400]   are places where human ingenuity is nurtured,
[02:08:15.400 --> 02:08:18.160]   where new knowledge is created,
[02:08:18.160 --> 02:08:22.920]   and where young people are equipped to answer questions
[02:08:22.920 --> 02:08:26.260]   that are open questions about our existence
[02:08:26.260 --> 02:08:27.960]   in the world that we live in.
[02:08:27.960 --> 02:08:30.940]   You can trace to the university much,
[02:08:30.940 --> 02:08:34.900]   if not most of the advances in technology
[02:08:34.900 --> 02:08:36.720]   and resourcefulness and our understanding
[02:08:36.720 --> 02:08:38.500]   of the origins of the species,
[02:08:38.500 --> 02:08:41.560]   of the nature of the universe, cosmology, et cetera,
[02:08:41.560 --> 02:08:45.600]   science, the pursuit of humanistic understanding,
[02:08:45.600 --> 02:08:48.160]   the nurturing of traditions of inquiry,
[02:08:48.160 --> 02:08:50.440]   so forth, so that's the university.
[02:08:50.440 --> 02:08:51.800]   Barbarians at the gates.
[02:08:51.800 --> 02:08:56.080]   The people who are trying to shut down open inquiry
[02:08:56.080 --> 02:08:59.140]   at the university on behalf of their particular view
[02:08:59.140 --> 02:09:04.140]   about things are a threat to what the university stands for,
[02:09:04.140 --> 02:09:06.400]   and they should be resisted.
[02:09:06.400 --> 02:09:11.400]   So if I'm inquiring about the nature of human intelligence,
[02:09:13.280 --> 02:09:16.320]   and I wanna study differences between human populations
[02:09:16.320 --> 02:09:18.120]   and their acquisition of,
[02:09:18.120 --> 02:09:22.020]   or their expression of cognitive ability,
[02:09:22.020 --> 02:09:24.600]   that's fair game, it's an open question.
[02:09:24.600 --> 02:09:27.240]   If I wanna know something about the nature
[02:09:27.240 --> 02:09:31.280]   of gender affiliation and identity
[02:09:31.280 --> 02:09:34.580]   and gender dysphoria and whatnot,
[02:09:34.580 --> 02:09:36.440]   that's fair game to study in a university.
[02:09:36.440 --> 02:09:40.000]   You can't shut that down, you shouldn't be able to,
[02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:44.040]   by saying, I have a particular position here,
[02:09:44.040 --> 02:09:45.760]   I'm a member of a particular identity group,
[02:09:45.760 --> 02:09:49.160]   suppose I wanna study the history of colonialism,
[02:09:49.160 --> 02:09:53.440]   and there's a narrative on the progressive side,
[02:09:53.440 --> 02:09:56.480]   which is colonialism's about Europeans dominating
[02:09:56.480 --> 02:09:57.920]   and stealing or whatever, whatever,
[02:09:57.920 --> 02:10:00.480]   and I happen to think, well, there's another aspect
[02:10:00.480 --> 02:10:02.040]   to the story about colonialism too,
[02:10:02.040 --> 02:10:05.080]   which is that it's a mechanism for the diffusion
[02:10:05.080 --> 02:10:06.800]   of the best in human civilization
[02:10:06.800 --> 02:10:10.400]   to populations that were significantly lagging behind.
[02:10:10.400 --> 02:10:12.900]   With respect to that, it brought literacy
[02:10:12.900 --> 02:10:15.360]   to the southern hemispheric populations
[02:10:15.360 --> 02:10:19.060]   that were dominated in the process of the colonizing thing.
[02:10:19.060 --> 02:10:20.160]   It's complicated.
[02:10:20.160 --> 02:10:22.240]   I'm not taking that position, by the way.
[02:10:22.240 --> 02:10:24.760]   I'm just saying somebody at a university
[02:10:24.760 --> 02:10:28.540]   should be able to take it up and pursue it
[02:10:28.540 --> 02:10:30.280]   and engage in argument with people about it.
[02:10:30.280 --> 02:10:31.840]   I'm talking about race and ethnicity,
[02:10:31.840 --> 02:10:34.600]   but this extends to a wide range of things.
[02:10:34.600 --> 02:10:36.680]   Suppose we're talking about climate,
[02:10:36.680 --> 02:10:38.720]   and one person says the Earth is endangered
[02:10:38.720 --> 02:10:42.520]   because carbon in global warming, et cetera, et cetera,
[02:10:42.520 --> 02:10:44.760]   and another person says, no, wait, no, wait,
[02:10:44.760 --> 02:10:48.160]   look at where we stand in the 21st century.
[02:10:48.160 --> 02:10:51.400]   We're vastly richer than our ancestors just 250 years ago.
[02:10:51.400 --> 02:10:53.240]   We have much more knowledge about that
[02:10:53.240 --> 02:10:54.080]   and so forth and so on.
[02:10:54.080 --> 02:10:59.080]   250 years from now, human ingenuity will have devised
[02:10:59.080 --> 02:11:02.760]   in ways that we cannot even begin to anticipate
[02:11:02.760 --> 02:11:07.760]   all manner of technological means for managing the problem.
[02:11:07.760 --> 02:11:11.360]   There's no reason that we should shut down
[02:11:11.360 --> 02:11:14.320]   industrial civilization today
[02:11:14.320 --> 02:11:16.880]   because we fear the consequences of it
[02:11:16.880 --> 02:11:20.480]   when in fact we are vastly richer than our ancestors
[02:11:20.480 --> 02:11:22.280]   and those who come up two centuries after us
[02:11:22.280 --> 02:11:25.840]   will be vastly more effective at dealing with problems
[02:11:25.840 --> 02:11:27.240]   than we are now.
[02:11:27.240 --> 02:11:28.560]   Let's, it's, you know, et cetera.
[02:11:28.560 --> 02:11:30.780]   I'm not actually making that argument.
[02:11:30.780 --> 02:11:34.600]   I'm just saying the tendency to try to say,
[02:11:34.600 --> 02:11:36.920]   oh no, that person is a climate denier.
[02:11:36.920 --> 02:11:40.200]   They can't pursue that area of inquiry
[02:11:40.200 --> 02:11:44.400]   is against the spirit of the university.
[02:11:44.400 --> 02:11:47.080]   I think the barbarians at the gates
[02:11:47.080 --> 02:11:50.440]   has to do with the people who think they know
[02:11:50.440 --> 02:11:52.060]   what the right side of history is
[02:11:52.060 --> 02:11:54.140]   and try to make the university stand
[02:11:54.140 --> 02:11:55.600]   on the right side of history.
[02:11:55.600 --> 02:11:58.620]   My position is you don't know
[02:11:58.620 --> 02:12:01.140]   what the right side of history is.
[02:12:01.140 --> 02:12:02.840]   And the purpose of a university
[02:12:02.840 --> 02:12:05.040]   is to equip you to be able to think about
[02:12:05.040 --> 02:12:07.480]   what is the right side of history?
[02:12:07.480 --> 02:12:11.880]   What is the solution to the dilemmas that confront us
[02:12:11.880 --> 02:12:14.440]   as human beings living on this planet
[02:12:14.440 --> 02:12:17.720]   with the billions that we are in the condition that we are?
[02:12:17.720 --> 02:12:22.440]   So the identitarians,
[02:12:22.440 --> 02:12:24.360]   the ones who want to make the university
[02:12:24.360 --> 02:12:28.940]   kowtow to their particular understandings
[02:12:28.940 --> 02:12:30.400]   about their own identity.
[02:12:30.400 --> 02:12:36.100]   We now have at Brown University and various other places,
[02:12:36.100 --> 02:12:38.300]   we don't do Columbus Day anymore.
[02:12:38.300 --> 02:12:40.600]   We do Indigenous Peoples Day.
[02:12:40.600 --> 02:12:42.900]   When that day comes up in October,
[02:12:42.900 --> 02:12:44.340]   we don't talk about Columbus.
[02:12:44.340 --> 02:12:45.940]   They're taking down statues of Columbus
[02:12:45.940 --> 02:12:48.620]   all across the country and so forth and so on.
[02:12:48.620 --> 02:12:50.900]   I'm not arguing anything here other than
[02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:56.260]   that the latter day position,
[02:12:56.260 --> 02:13:03.520]   BIPOCs, black, indigenous, and other people of color,
[02:13:03.520 --> 02:13:07.580]   the latter day position that the university has to reflect
[02:13:07.580 --> 02:13:12.000]   a particular sensibility about these identity questions,
[02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.880]   I think it's a threat to the integrity of the enterprise.
[02:13:14.880 --> 02:13:16.560]   - I don't think you're overstating it.
[02:13:16.560 --> 02:13:21.000]   I tend to be, just from my limited knowledge
[02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:25.360]   of MIT, but perhaps it applies broadly.
[02:13:25.360 --> 02:13:29.880]   I think the beauty of the university, broadly speaking,
[02:13:29.880 --> 02:13:31.960]   is the faculty and the students.
[02:13:31.960 --> 02:13:38.520]   And the problem arises from the overreach
[02:13:38.520 --> 02:13:43.920]   of a overgrowing administration
[02:13:46.040 --> 02:13:51.040]   that gives, again, thinks that it knows enough
[02:13:51.040 --> 02:13:56.120]   to make rules and conclusions based on a set of beliefs,
[02:13:56.120 --> 02:14:00.180]   and then based on that, empowers a certain small selection
[02:14:00.180 --> 02:14:04.880]   of students to be the sort of voices of activism,
[02:14:04.880 --> 02:14:07.080]   of a particular idea.
[02:14:07.080 --> 02:14:10.080]   And not, I think activism is beautiful,
[02:14:10.080 --> 02:14:11.320]   but not just activism,
[02:14:11.320 --> 02:14:13.720]   but anybody that disagrees is shut down.
[02:14:14.760 --> 02:14:19.760]   And that, I think, the blame lies with the administration.
[02:14:19.760 --> 02:14:23.220]   So I think the solution is in lessening,
[02:14:23.220 --> 02:14:25.680]   just like the solution with too big of a government,
[02:14:25.680 --> 02:14:27.200]   too big of a bureaucracy,
[02:14:27.200 --> 02:14:32.080]   is there needs to be a redistribution of power
[02:14:32.080 --> 02:14:34.640]   to what makes universities beautiful,
[02:14:34.640 --> 02:14:38.840]   which is the old students and the young students,
[02:14:38.840 --> 02:14:42.240]   old students being professors.
[02:14:42.240 --> 02:14:45.920]   So the scholars, the curious minds,
[02:14:45.920 --> 02:14:48.140]   the people that are in this whole thing
[02:14:48.140 --> 02:14:51.180]   to explore the world, to be curious about it,
[02:14:51.180 --> 02:14:53.340]   on a salary that's probably way too low
[02:14:53.340 --> 02:14:54.720]   for the thing they're doing.
[02:14:54.720 --> 02:14:57.000]   That's the whole point.
[02:14:57.000 --> 02:15:01.080]   And then the administration just gets in the way
[02:15:01.080 --> 02:15:05.800]   and is the source of this kind of,
[02:15:05.800 --> 02:15:08.980]   I would say that, in your beautiful phrasing,
[02:15:08.980 --> 02:15:11.300]   I would say the administration is the barbarians
[02:15:11.300 --> 02:15:12.180]   at the gate.
[02:15:12.180 --> 02:15:15.440]   So the solution is smaller bureaucracies,
[02:15:15.440 --> 02:15:16.880]   smaller administrations.
[02:15:16.880 --> 02:15:18.920]   I have to, on this point, you had this conversation,
[02:15:18.920 --> 02:15:23.160]   you put on your self-stack with Jordan Peterson
[02:15:23.160 --> 02:15:25.400]   about cognitive inequality.
[02:15:25.400 --> 02:15:28.400]   I think it's titled "Wrestling with Cognitive Inequality."
[02:15:28.400 --> 02:15:34.540]   This particular topic of just IQ differences between groups,
[02:15:34.540 --> 02:15:39.240]   why is this, why is it so dangerous to talk about?
[02:15:40.380 --> 02:15:42.880]   Why this particular topic?
[02:15:42.880 --> 02:15:45.060]   - Well, it's like you're calling black people inferior.
[02:15:45.060 --> 02:15:46.920]   It's like you're saying they're genetically inferior.
[02:15:46.920 --> 02:15:48.560]   That's what people are saying.
[02:15:48.560 --> 02:15:51.840]   It's like you're rationalizing the disparity of outcomes
[02:15:51.840 --> 02:15:55.960]   by reference to the intrinsic inferiority of black people.
[02:15:55.960 --> 02:16:00.960]   If you say cognitive ability matters for social outcomes,
[02:16:00.960 --> 02:16:03.660]   if you say cognitive ability exists,
[02:16:03.660 --> 02:16:04.680]   people really are different
[02:16:04.680 --> 02:16:07.240]   in terms of their intellectual functioning.
[02:16:07.240 --> 02:16:09.920]   And if you say cognitive ability differences
[02:16:09.920 --> 02:16:14.920]   are substantial between racially defined populations,
[02:16:14.920 --> 02:16:17.200]   the sum of that, there is cognitive ability,
[02:16:17.200 --> 02:16:19.260]   it matters, and it differs by race,
[02:16:19.260 --> 02:16:22.700]   is the conclusion that outcome differences by race
[02:16:22.700 --> 02:16:26.240]   are in part due to natural differences
[02:16:26.240 --> 02:16:28.000]   between the populations.
[02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.800]   People find that to be completely offensive
[02:16:30.800 --> 02:16:32.200]   and unacceptable.
[02:16:32.200 --> 02:16:34.040]   So that's what I think is going on.
[02:16:34.040 --> 02:16:37.240]   - Can you steel man that case
[02:16:37.240 --> 02:16:40.600]   that we should be careful doing that kind of research?
[02:16:40.600 --> 02:16:46.480]   So this has to do with research.
[02:16:46.480 --> 02:16:51.520]   It's like the Nazis used Nietzsche in their propaganda.
[02:16:51.520 --> 02:16:58.500]   You can use, white supremacists could use conclusions,
[02:16:58.500 --> 02:17:04.880]   cherry pick conclusions of studies to push their agenda.
[02:17:04.880 --> 02:17:07.040]   Can you steel man the case that we should be careful?
[02:17:07.040 --> 02:17:08.520]   - Yeah, I can do it at three levels.
[02:17:08.520 --> 02:17:11.520]   One is, what do we mean by cognitive ability?
[02:17:11.520 --> 02:17:13.640]   So there's many different kinds of intelligence
[02:17:13.640 --> 02:17:15.360]   a person might say.
[02:17:15.360 --> 02:17:18.240]   How good are IQ tests at measuring
[02:17:18.240 --> 02:17:20.760]   other kinds of human capacities
[02:17:20.760 --> 02:17:24.240]   that are pertinent to success in life,
[02:17:24.240 --> 02:17:27.680]   like temperament, like emotional intelligence, and so on.
[02:17:27.680 --> 02:17:31.000]   So intelligence is not a one dimensional thing
[02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:32.660]   measured by G.
[02:17:32.660 --> 02:17:36.000]   The cognitive psychologists talk about G,
[02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.440]   the general intelligence factor,
[02:17:38.440 --> 02:17:41.400]   which is a statistical construction.
[02:17:41.400 --> 02:17:46.400]   It's a factor analytic resolution of the correlation
[02:17:46.400 --> 02:17:49.720]   across individuals in their performance on a battery
[02:17:49.720 --> 02:17:50.720]   of different kind of tests.
[02:17:50.720 --> 02:17:55.720]   And they use that to define a general factor of intelligence
[02:17:55.720 --> 02:17:59.880]   and a person could say, that is a very narrow view
[02:17:59.880 --> 02:18:04.760]   of what human mental capacities actually are.
[02:18:04.760 --> 02:18:07.880]   And that it's much better to think about
[02:18:07.880 --> 02:18:12.520]   multi-dimensional measures of human mental functioning
[02:18:12.520 --> 02:18:15.320]   rather than a single cognitive ability measure,
[02:18:15.320 --> 02:18:20.320]   a so-called IQ, which is a narrow construction
[02:18:20.320 --> 02:18:26.160]   that doesn't capture all of the subtle nuance
[02:18:26.160 --> 02:18:28.280]   of human difference in functioning.
[02:18:28.280 --> 02:18:33.280]   Functioning is not just the ability to recite backwards
[02:18:33.860 --> 02:18:36.080]   a sequence of numbers, I say, eight, seven, nine,
[02:18:36.080 --> 02:18:39.220]   five, three, two, you say, two, three, five, seven, eight,
[02:18:39.220 --> 02:18:40.980]   nine, it's not just that.
[02:18:40.980 --> 02:18:45.980]   Intelligence is a complex management
[02:18:45.980 --> 02:18:49.600]   of many different dimensions of human performance,
[02:18:49.600 --> 02:18:54.600]   including things like being able to stick with a task
[02:18:54.600 --> 02:18:58.800]   and not give up, things like being able to discipline
[02:18:58.800 --> 02:19:02.040]   and control your impulses so as to remain focused
[02:19:02.040 --> 02:19:03.520]   and so forth.
[02:19:03.520 --> 02:19:04.580]   That could be one dimension.
[02:19:04.580 --> 02:19:07.520]   I could start by questioning the very foundation
[02:19:07.520 --> 02:19:10.580]   of the argument for racial differences
[02:19:10.580 --> 02:19:14.580]   in cognitive ability by saying that your measure
[02:19:14.580 --> 02:19:18.320]   of cognitive ability is flawed.
[02:19:18.320 --> 02:19:19.820]   I could go to a higher level.
[02:19:19.820 --> 02:19:23.840]   I could say, what we're really interested in
[02:19:23.840 --> 02:19:28.840]   is social outcomes and the question of what factors
[02:19:28.840 --> 02:19:31.440]   influence social outcomes extends well beyond
[02:19:31.440 --> 02:19:33.960]   mental ability to many other things.
[02:19:33.960 --> 02:19:35.400]   So here's an example.
[02:19:35.400 --> 02:19:41.980]   Visual acuity, how well do you see?
[02:19:41.980 --> 02:19:43.920]   You're not wearing glasses, I am.
[02:19:43.920 --> 02:19:48.960]   Visual acuity varies between human beings.
[02:19:48.960 --> 02:19:52.160]   Some people see better than other people do.
[02:19:52.160 --> 02:19:54.680]   Visual acuity can be measured.
[02:19:54.680 --> 02:19:57.040]   I can put you at the chart and you can,
[02:19:57.040 --> 02:19:58.800]   can you identify and read that bottom line
[02:19:58.800 --> 02:20:00.280]   in small print or not?
[02:20:00.280 --> 02:20:02.580]   So we can measure visual acuity and it varies
[02:20:02.580 --> 02:20:04.000]   between human beings.
[02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:07.520]   Visual acuity is partly genetic.
[02:20:07.520 --> 02:20:09.860]   I think that's undoubtedly true.
[02:20:09.860 --> 02:20:12.200]   We inherit genes that influence whether or not
[02:20:12.200 --> 02:20:15.880]   we are nearsighted or farsighted or astigmatic or whatever.
[02:20:15.880 --> 02:20:19.640]   So visual acuity differs between people
[02:20:19.640 --> 02:20:23.720]   and can be measured and is under genetic control.
[02:20:23.720 --> 02:20:28.060]   On the other hand, corrective lenses allow for us
[02:20:28.060 --> 02:20:29.740]   to level the playing field between people
[02:20:29.740 --> 02:20:34.120]   who are differently endowed in terms of visual acuity.
[02:20:34.120 --> 02:20:37.200]   Likewise, social outcomes are what we're really interested
[02:20:37.200 --> 02:20:40.520]   in, employment, earnings, whether or not
[02:20:40.520 --> 02:20:42.920]   they're law abiding, how do they conduct themselves
[02:20:42.920 --> 02:20:45.720]   and their families and so forth amongst individuals.
[02:20:45.720 --> 02:20:48.720]   Yes, social outcomes are influenced by so-called
[02:20:48.720 --> 02:20:50.240]   cognitive ability, but they're influenced
[02:20:50.240 --> 02:20:52.360]   by many other things as well.
[02:20:52.360 --> 02:20:55.540]   If there are interventions that can be undertaken
[02:20:55.540 --> 02:20:58.240]   in society that level the playing field
[02:20:58.240 --> 02:21:00.440]   between people who have different natural endowments
[02:21:00.440 --> 02:21:03.280]   of cognitive ability, the fact that people
[02:21:03.280 --> 02:21:05.840]   or groups differ in cognitive ability
[02:21:05.840 --> 02:21:07.540]   becomes less significant.
[02:21:07.540 --> 02:21:10.140]   Just like it's less significant that people differ
[02:21:10.140 --> 02:21:13.440]   with respect to how well they see when corrective lenses
[02:21:13.440 --> 02:21:16.960]   allow for the leveling of that playing field.
[02:21:16.960 --> 02:21:20.760]   There are in fact interventions, educational interventions,
[02:21:20.760 --> 02:21:23.760]   early childhood interventions that have been shown
[02:21:23.760 --> 02:21:26.800]   to level the playing field to create better life outcomes
[02:21:26.800 --> 02:21:30.000]   for people even if they happen to be endowed
[02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:31.000]   with low intelligence.
[02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:35.360]   So a second level of arguing against this whole program
[02:21:35.360 --> 02:21:38.240]   of research on human differences in intelligence
[02:21:38.240 --> 02:21:40.360]   is to observe that yes, human beings
[02:21:40.360 --> 02:21:43.320]   and perhaps racially defined groups may differ
[02:21:43.320 --> 02:21:46.560]   on the average in intellectual endowment,
[02:21:46.560 --> 02:21:49.120]   but there well may be social interventions
[02:21:49.120 --> 02:21:52.000]   that level the playing field, whether it's in education
[02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:55.160]   or in other kinds of programmatic interventions,
[02:21:55.160 --> 02:21:57.280]   especially for the poor.
[02:21:57.280 --> 02:21:59.880]   A final level of argument is the one that you alluded to,
[02:21:59.880 --> 02:22:02.100]   which is that if you talk like this,
[02:22:02.100 --> 02:22:04.260]   you're gonna encourage a kind of politics
[02:22:04.260 --> 02:22:09.260]   which is very ugly, and it's best to frame the discussion
[02:22:09.260 --> 02:22:14.480]   in ways that don't put emphasis on racially defined
[02:22:14.480 --> 02:22:17.600]   natural differences between populations.
[02:22:17.600 --> 02:22:21.360]   That's an argument that I am myself personally
[02:22:21.360 --> 02:22:24.420]   conflicted about.
[02:22:24.420 --> 02:22:27.280]   On the one hand, I think, you know,
[02:22:27.280 --> 02:22:32.280]   those people are just stupid, it is racist, okay?
[02:22:32.280 --> 02:22:36.520]   On the other hand, I think the calculation,
[02:22:36.520 --> 02:22:38.160]   we shouldn't do this kind of research.
[02:22:38.160 --> 02:22:40.080]   Suppose I'm at the National Science Foundation,
[02:22:40.080 --> 02:22:42.360]   a research team submits a proposal,
[02:22:42.360 --> 02:22:44.760]   the proposal proposes to undertake a study,
[02:22:44.760 --> 02:22:48.540]   the study would explore the extent to which people
[02:22:48.540 --> 02:22:50.480]   and racial groups differ with respect
[02:22:50.480 --> 02:22:52.520]   to their intellectual performance
[02:22:52.520 --> 02:22:55.020]   and how that's influenced by their genetic
[02:22:55.020 --> 02:22:56.860]   and environmental interaction.
[02:22:56.860 --> 02:22:59.120]   And I decide not to fund the study
[02:22:59.120 --> 02:23:01.840]   based on a political calculation
[02:23:01.840 --> 02:23:04.600]   that the subject is too sensitive,
[02:23:04.600 --> 02:23:06.580]   and if you explore that subject,
[02:23:06.580 --> 02:23:08.280]   you might get the wrong answer,
[02:23:08.280 --> 02:23:09.900]   and if you get the wrong answer,
[02:23:09.900 --> 02:23:12.480]   the white supremacist will be encouraged.
[02:23:12.480 --> 02:23:17.480]   Well, that is presuming before the research is done
[02:23:17.480 --> 02:23:19.780]   that I know the outcome of the research
[02:23:19.780 --> 02:23:23.060]   and that I can calculate what the political consequence
[02:23:23.060 --> 02:23:25.280]   of the research outcome is gonna be.
[02:23:25.280 --> 02:23:27.680]   That's assuming the thing before you even know
[02:23:27.680 --> 02:23:30.400]   what the thing actually is, it's a kind of omniscience.
[02:23:30.400 --> 02:23:35.400]   It presumes that you as the master of the universe
[02:23:35.400 --> 02:23:38.120]   can tell people what it is that people
[02:23:38.120 --> 02:23:39.380]   are being treated like children,
[02:23:39.380 --> 02:23:41.540]   what it is that they're capable of knowing
[02:23:41.540 --> 02:23:44.080]   and what it is that they're not capable of knowing.
[02:23:44.080 --> 02:23:47.480]   It would be like someone saying to Einstein,
[02:23:47.480 --> 02:23:49.760]   I don't know about that special relativity theory,
[02:23:49.760 --> 02:23:52.320]   you know, it could well lead to the development
[02:23:52.320 --> 02:23:54.400]   of technologies that would allow nuclear weapons,
[02:23:54.400 --> 02:23:55.760]   or someone saying to Oppenheimer,
[02:23:55.760 --> 02:23:58.860]   who was a physicist overseeing the Manhattan Project
[02:23:58.860 --> 02:24:02.160]   where the US developed nuclear weapons capacity,
[02:24:02.160 --> 02:24:07.000]   don't carry out that project because the results
[02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:08.840]   of acquiring that knowledge may be more
[02:24:08.840 --> 02:24:10.440]   than we can deal with.
[02:24:10.440 --> 02:24:13.720]   Or someone saying to someone doing biomedical research
[02:24:13.720 --> 02:24:18.720]   who's interested in exploring the nature of the human genome,
[02:24:19.240 --> 02:24:20.920]   don't carry out that experiment,
[02:24:20.920 --> 02:24:22.760]   that cloning undertaking, whatever,
[02:24:22.760 --> 02:24:26.040]   because the consequences could be deleterious.
[02:24:26.040 --> 02:24:27.800]   Well, the consequences could be deleterious.
[02:24:27.800 --> 02:24:30.200]   The consequences could also be the cure of cancer.
[02:24:30.200 --> 02:24:32.480]   The consequences could also be being able
[02:24:32.480 --> 02:24:33.700]   to generate electric power
[02:24:33.700 --> 02:24:36.720]   without producing carbon effluent.
[02:24:36.720 --> 02:24:40.640]   So who are you to tell me, you being the person
[02:24:40.640 --> 02:24:44.160]   in the political position to control the research,
[02:24:44.160 --> 02:24:46.120]   what the consequence of doing the research is?
[02:24:46.120 --> 02:24:50.840]   I think I don't want to cede that kind of power
[02:24:50.840 --> 02:24:55.840]   to politicians over the course of human inquiry.
[02:24:55.840 --> 02:24:59.760]   So yes, I would want there to be regulations
[02:24:59.760 --> 02:25:03.920]   governing the use of biologically sensitive
[02:25:03.920 --> 02:25:07.360]   and potentially dangerous pathogens in a lab,
[02:25:07.360 --> 02:25:10.120]   in Wuhan, or anyplace else.
[02:25:10.120 --> 02:25:13.320]   I would not want to simply leave that to laissez-faire.
[02:25:13.320 --> 02:25:16.680]   On the other hand, I think that the tendency
[02:25:16.680 --> 02:25:20.440]   to try to shut down inquiry on behalf
[02:25:20.440 --> 02:25:24.260]   of supposed adverse political consequences
[02:25:24.260 --> 02:25:27.660]   is the road to ignorance and impoverishment
[02:25:27.660 --> 02:25:29.500]   at the end of the day for humankind,
[02:25:29.500 --> 02:25:31.620]   denying ourselves the potential benefits
[02:25:31.620 --> 02:25:33.120]   of that kind of inquiry.
[02:25:33.120 --> 02:25:35.680]   I think we need to take our chances with inquiry
[02:25:35.680 --> 02:25:37.080]   rather than to try to control it.
[02:25:37.080 --> 02:25:39.440]   And I feel that way about the exploration
[02:25:39.440 --> 02:25:42.820]   of human intelligence as much as anything else.
[02:25:42.820 --> 02:25:44.680]   - So you've asked me to steel man the case
[02:25:44.680 --> 02:25:47.560]   against research on IQ of the sort
[02:25:47.560 --> 02:25:51.200]   that Charles Murray is famous for popularizing.
[02:25:51.200 --> 02:25:54.820]   And I've said, A, your measure of intelligence
[02:25:54.820 --> 02:25:58.360]   is single-dimensional and it ought to be multi-dimensional.
[02:25:58.360 --> 02:26:02.040]   I've said, B, the consequences of people's differing
[02:26:02.040 --> 02:26:04.000]   in intelligence depends not only
[02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:05.900]   on the natural endowments of the people,
[02:26:05.900 --> 02:26:09.820]   but also on the environment and the potential
[02:26:09.820 --> 02:26:12.320]   for intervening in that environment
[02:26:12.320 --> 02:26:14.320]   through one or another kind of instrument
[02:26:14.320 --> 02:26:17.360]   as the metaphorical example of the use
[02:26:17.360 --> 02:26:20.080]   of corrective lenses to level the playing field
[02:26:20.080 --> 02:26:25.040]   between people with different visual acuity indicates.
[02:26:25.040 --> 02:26:29.600]   But finally, I've said, yes, research on racial differences
[02:26:29.600 --> 02:26:33.840]   in IQ can foster political beliefs
[02:26:33.840 --> 02:26:38.360]   that we would regard to be obnoxious.
[02:26:38.360 --> 02:26:41.680]   On the other hand, to presume that what we don't know yet
[02:26:41.680 --> 02:26:44.920]   and might find out from the research is gonna be harmful
[02:26:44.920 --> 02:26:48.280]   is to assume a kind of presumption
[02:26:48.280 --> 02:26:52.840]   or of knowing what the outcome of unknown processes might be,
[02:26:52.840 --> 02:26:55.740]   which we ought to be very slow to embrace,
[02:26:55.740 --> 02:26:57.840]   because if we had done so in the past,
[02:26:57.840 --> 02:27:00.000]   we wouldn't have nuclear power.
[02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:01.160]   There's a lot of things that we wouldn't know.
[02:27:01.160 --> 02:27:03.360]   I mean, what were people saying about Darwin
[02:27:03.360 --> 02:27:07.960]   and exploration of the evolution and origin of the species?
[02:27:07.960 --> 02:27:10.360]   They were afraid that it was gonna, in effect,
[02:27:10.360 --> 02:27:14.520]   disprove the religious-based accounts of,
[02:27:14.520 --> 02:27:17.440]   what were they saying about Copernicus and et cetera,
[02:27:17.440 --> 02:27:19.760]   et cetera, so, you know.
[02:27:19.760 --> 02:27:24.760]   - That was a masterful layering of, quote,
[02:27:24.760 --> 02:27:26.840]   wrestling with the cognitive inequality.
[02:27:26.840 --> 02:27:28.560]   You dragged in nuclear research,
[02:27:28.560 --> 02:27:32.800]   Copernicus, Darwin, biomedical research with genetics,
[02:27:32.800 --> 02:27:37.160]   even COVID and the lab leak.
[02:27:37.160 --> 02:27:39.880]   I mean, that was just fun to listen to.
[02:27:39.880 --> 02:27:40.720]   Okay. - Okay.
[02:27:40.720 --> 02:27:42.920]   (Lex laughing)
[02:27:42.920 --> 02:27:44.840]   - Let me ask you about your politics.
[02:27:44.840 --> 02:27:48.440]   So you've recently said that you're a conservative-leaning.
[02:27:48.440 --> 02:27:51.040]   Maybe that's a day-to-day thing.
[02:27:51.040 --> 02:27:52.200]   Maybe you can push back.
[02:27:52.200 --> 02:27:55.880]   So you have somebody like your friend, John McWhorter,
[02:27:55.880 --> 02:28:01.720]   who we could say is on your left, to the left of you,
[02:28:01.720 --> 02:28:05.680]   and then you have somebody like Thomas Sowell,
[02:28:05.680 --> 02:28:09.440]   who maybe is to the right of you.
[02:28:09.440 --> 02:28:10.280]   - Yeah, probably.
[02:28:10.280 --> 02:28:14.040]   - And yet there's a lot of overlap between the three of you.
[02:28:14.040 --> 02:28:19.040]   So to what degree does politics affect your view on race
[02:28:19.040 --> 02:28:24.680]   in America, and maybe to what degree does your view
[02:28:24.680 --> 02:28:26.700]   on race affect your politics?
[02:28:26.700 --> 02:28:29.400]   - Okay.
[02:28:29.400 --> 02:28:31.520]   - And that, for people who don't know,
[02:28:31.520 --> 02:28:33.840]   has shifted over time.
[02:28:33.840 --> 02:28:36.240]   You've been on quite a rollercoaster,
[02:28:36.240 --> 02:28:38.760]   as anybody who thinks about the world should be.
[02:28:39.760 --> 02:28:44.760]   - Well, let's begin with the fact that I was trained
[02:28:44.760 --> 02:28:48.080]   as an economist in a tradition
[02:28:48.080 --> 02:28:52.760]   of what many people would call neoliberalism.
[02:28:52.760 --> 02:28:57.760]   I was trained at MIT, which was not a right-wing place
[02:28:57.760 --> 02:29:02.960]   by any means, but it was a place where you learned
[02:29:02.960 --> 02:29:06.760]   about markets and about the benefits
[02:29:06.760 --> 02:29:11.760]   of capitalism as a way of organizing society,
[02:29:11.760 --> 02:29:16.200]   the virtues of free enterprise,
[02:29:16.200 --> 02:29:18.000]   the fact that the pursuit of profit
[02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:19.660]   was not necessarily a bad thing,
[02:29:19.660 --> 02:29:22.740]   but it well might be the road to prosperity
[02:29:22.740 --> 02:29:26.020]   and to economic growth, the idea that private property
[02:29:26.020 --> 02:29:29.180]   and individuals seeking to acquire and succeeding
[02:29:29.180 --> 02:29:33.280]   in acquiring wealth did create inequality,
[02:29:33.280 --> 02:29:35.040]   but it also created opportunity,
[02:29:35.040 --> 02:29:38.080]   and it also expanded our knowledge and our control
[02:29:38.080 --> 02:29:40.640]   over the physical environment in which we're embedded,
[02:29:40.640 --> 02:29:41.960]   and et cetera.
[02:29:41.960 --> 02:29:47.120]   So we were not Marxists at MIT,
[02:29:47.120 --> 02:29:48.200]   although we did read Marx.
[02:29:48.200 --> 02:29:50.120]   I mean, those of us who were intellectually curious,
[02:29:50.120 --> 02:29:50.960]   you read Marx.
[02:29:50.960 --> 02:29:53.920]   Marx was an important figure in the history of the West,
[02:29:53.920 --> 02:29:56.720]   and I think Marx should be read in Capital,
[02:29:56.720 --> 02:29:58.760]   three volumes, et cetera,
[02:29:58.760 --> 02:30:01.720]   alienation of labor and whatnot,
[02:30:01.720 --> 02:30:04.360]   the implications of modernization,
[02:30:04.360 --> 02:30:08.920]   of the advent of industrial capitalism, et cetera,
[02:30:08.920 --> 02:30:12.480]   that kind of dynamic deserves to be studied
[02:30:12.480 --> 02:30:15.080]   and to come at it in a critical way,
[02:30:15.080 --> 02:30:21.380]   informed by the intellectual inheritance of Marx and Marxism.
[02:30:21.380 --> 02:30:23.840]   I think that's a part of a full education
[02:30:23.840 --> 02:30:28.340]   in social philosophy and economic analysis
[02:30:28.340 --> 02:30:32.320]   that open-minded person ought to acquaint themselves with.
[02:30:32.320 --> 02:30:33.320]   But at the end of the day,
[02:30:33.320 --> 02:30:38.320]   I think that the free marketeers have the better of it.
[02:30:38.320 --> 02:30:43.180]   I think the story of the 20th century,
[02:30:43.180 --> 02:30:47.860]   as far as economic development is concerned, reflects that.
[02:30:47.860 --> 02:30:49.260]   I think that the experiments
[02:30:49.260 --> 02:30:54.260]   where centralized control over economic decisions
[02:30:54.260 --> 02:30:57.680]   was the order of the day failed.
[02:30:57.680 --> 02:31:01.860]   I think that the fact of the 21st century rise of China
[02:31:01.860 --> 02:31:06.740]   as a force has a lot to do with the spread of, in effect,
[02:31:06.740 --> 02:31:11.460]   capitalist-oriented modes of economic exchange,
[02:31:11.460 --> 02:31:15.500]   freeing up prices, markets, property, and so forth,
[02:31:15.500 --> 02:31:18.020]   although obviously it's a complicated
[02:31:18.020 --> 02:31:21.320]   political economic system, I'm talking about China.
[02:31:21.320 --> 02:31:26.040]   But I think that the story of the 20th century
[02:31:26.040 --> 02:31:28.240]   and the hope for the 21st century
[02:31:28.240 --> 02:31:31.660]   is that prosperity is enhanced
[02:31:31.660 --> 02:31:35.740]   through the free exchange of goods
[02:31:35.740 --> 02:31:40.100]   and the pursuit and acquisition of property
[02:31:40.100 --> 02:31:45.100]   by people in a more or less capitalist-oriented system.
[02:31:45.100 --> 02:31:49.860]   That's the view that I hold.
[02:31:49.860 --> 02:31:52.340]   I guess that makes me a conservative, I don't know.
[02:31:52.340 --> 02:31:56.560]   I wanna say that's not to the exclusion
[02:31:56.560 --> 02:31:58.400]   of a social safety net.
[02:31:58.400 --> 02:32:02.800]   I'm not saying that old people in an ideal social system
[02:32:02.800 --> 02:32:04.440]   would be left to their own devices
[02:32:04.440 --> 02:32:05.440]   regardless of whether or not
[02:32:05.440 --> 02:32:07.340]   they had saved for their retirement.
[02:32:07.340 --> 02:32:11.080]   I'm not saying that the ideal
[02:32:11.080 --> 02:32:15.280]   of extending decent access to healthcare to all people,
[02:32:15.280 --> 02:32:18.000]   regardless of whether or not they can afford it,
[02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:20.840]   decent access to education to people,
[02:32:20.840 --> 02:32:22.920]   regardless of whether or not they can afford it,
[02:32:22.920 --> 02:32:25.680]   is standing in the way of prosperity.
[02:32:25.680 --> 02:32:26.940]   I don't believe that.
[02:32:26.940 --> 02:32:29.560]   I think the mixed economies that we see in Northern Europe
[02:32:29.560 --> 02:32:34.560]   and in North America are a balancing
[02:32:34.560 --> 02:32:37.880]   of the virtues of free enterprise, property,
[02:32:37.880 --> 02:32:40.480]   and the pursuit of wealth on the one hand
[02:32:40.480 --> 02:32:44.200]   against the needs to have a decent society
[02:32:44.200 --> 02:32:46.560]   in which people who fall between the cracks,
[02:32:46.560 --> 02:32:49.080]   nevertheless, are bolstered
[02:32:49.080 --> 02:32:51.560]   through a sense of social solidarity
[02:32:51.560 --> 02:32:54.520]   that is accommodated by our common membership
[02:32:54.520 --> 02:32:56.840]   within a single nation state,
[02:32:56.840 --> 02:32:59.240]   which is why I think nationalism is important,
[02:32:59.240 --> 02:33:02.120]   and it's why I think borders are important,
[02:33:02.120 --> 02:33:06.440]   because without a coherent polity
[02:33:06.440 --> 02:33:11.440]   who can see themselves as in a common situation
[02:33:11.440 --> 02:33:15.080]   and agree through their politics
[02:33:15.080 --> 02:33:17.480]   to support each other to some extent,
[02:33:17.480 --> 02:33:18.940]   you can't sustain a safety net,
[02:33:18.940 --> 02:33:23.040]   you cannot have a social safety net for a global population,
[02:33:23.040 --> 02:33:24.640]   you can only have a social safety net
[02:33:24.640 --> 02:33:27.000]   for a bounded population
[02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:30.040]   who have a sense of common membership
[02:33:30.040 --> 02:33:33.000]   in an ongoing political enterprise,
[02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:35.640]   which they pay their dues through their taxes
[02:33:35.640 --> 02:33:36.920]   in order to sustain it.
[02:33:36.920 --> 02:33:38.880]   There's a balancing that has to go on.
[02:33:38.880 --> 02:33:42.160]   So that's the first thing that I would say about my politics.
[02:33:42.160 --> 02:33:44.000]   I'm a neoliberal economist.
[02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:46.160]   I believe in markets, I believe in prices,
[02:33:46.160 --> 02:33:47.760]   I believe in profit.
[02:33:47.760 --> 02:33:51.020]   Corporations are not an incarnation of evil.
[02:33:51.020 --> 02:33:53.460]   Corporations are a legal nexus
[02:33:53.460 --> 02:33:56.580]   through which production gets organized
[02:33:56.580 --> 02:34:00.460]   in which you solicit the cooperation of workers,
[02:34:00.460 --> 02:34:02.340]   of people who provide capital,
[02:34:02.340 --> 02:34:04.020]   of people who provide raw materials
[02:34:04.020 --> 02:34:06.700]   and input of customers, and so on,
[02:34:06.700 --> 02:34:11.700]   and that functionality allows for the production of goods
[02:34:11.700 --> 02:34:16.580]   and their distribution and their earning of income
[02:34:16.580 --> 02:34:20.480]   and its distribution, which at the end of the day
[02:34:20.480 --> 02:34:22.160]   is the foundation of our prosperity.
[02:34:22.160 --> 02:34:23.440]   Corporations are people too.
[02:34:23.440 --> 02:34:26.640]   Mitt Romney got in trouble for saying that in 2012.
[02:34:26.640 --> 02:34:28.720]   But corporations are nothing but a legal fiction.
[02:34:28.720 --> 02:34:32.080]   The corporation is not a person as such,
[02:34:32.080 --> 02:34:35.060]   but the nexus of contracts and relationships
[02:34:35.060 --> 02:34:38.040]   amongst the stakeholders who intersect
[02:34:38.040 --> 02:34:41.280]   in the context of the corporation
[02:34:41.280 --> 02:34:43.180]   is the way in which we organize
[02:34:43.180 --> 02:34:46.320]   the massively complex set of activities
[02:34:46.320 --> 02:34:50.920]   that are necessary in order to produce economic benefits,
[02:34:50.920 --> 02:34:52.000]   in order to feed people,
[02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:54.980]   in order to have everybody with a cell phone in their pocket,
[02:34:54.980 --> 02:34:57.840]   in order to be able to travel from one side of a continent
[02:34:57.840 --> 02:35:01.660]   to another on a device that is with almost absolute certainty
[02:35:01.660 --> 02:35:03.980]   gonna safely take off and land,
[02:35:03.980 --> 02:35:07.480]   and in order to be able to build cities, et cetera.
[02:35:07.480 --> 02:35:10.560]   - But to the markets, the ideal of the market
[02:35:10.560 --> 02:35:14.920]   collide with the ideal of all men are created equal.
[02:35:14.920 --> 02:35:17.720]   The identity, the struggle that we've been talking about
[02:35:17.720 --> 02:35:21.340]   of what it means to sort of empower humans
[02:35:21.340 --> 02:35:23.280]   that make up this great country,
[02:35:23.280 --> 02:35:26.280]   do they collide and where do they collide?
[02:35:26.280 --> 02:35:29.320]   - Well, markets are gonna produce inequality,
[02:35:29.320 --> 02:35:32.220]   and all men being equal is a statement
[02:35:32.220 --> 02:35:34.420]   about the intrinsic worth of people,
[02:35:34.420 --> 02:35:36.960]   not about the situation that will come about
[02:35:36.960 --> 02:35:39.300]   when people interact with each other through markets,
[02:35:39.300 --> 02:35:41.840]   because people are actually different.
[02:35:41.840 --> 02:35:43.120]   And because there are factors
[02:35:43.120 --> 02:35:46.240]   that are beyond anybody's control called luck and chance
[02:35:46.240 --> 02:35:49.240]   that you and I both invest,
[02:35:49.240 --> 02:35:51.520]   it looked a priori like your investment and my investment
[02:35:51.520 --> 02:35:53.640]   were equally likely to succeed.
[02:35:53.640 --> 02:35:55.640]   But as a matter of fact, ex post facto,
[02:35:55.640 --> 02:35:58.840]   your investment succeeds, my investment doesn't succeed.
[02:35:58.840 --> 02:36:01.020]   I don't have wealth and you have wealth.
[02:36:01.020 --> 02:36:04.280]   That is an inevitable consequence of a environment
[02:36:04.280 --> 02:36:07.640]   in which both of us are free to make our investment choices
[02:36:07.640 --> 02:36:09.800]   and where the consequences of investment
[02:36:09.800 --> 02:36:12.600]   depend in part upon random circumstances
[02:36:12.600 --> 02:36:14.760]   of which no one has control.
[02:36:14.760 --> 02:36:16.360]   But you asked me about my politics
[02:36:16.360 --> 02:36:18.420]   and I was just trying to lay down a foundation
[02:36:18.420 --> 02:36:22.440]   by saying I begin as an economist
[02:36:22.440 --> 02:36:27.000]   in the tradition of liberalism, Adam Smith and so forth,
[02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:29.400]   John Maynard Keynes for that matter and so forth,
[02:36:29.400 --> 02:36:34.400]   that Milton Friedman and so forth,
[02:36:34.400 --> 02:36:39.400]   that Paul Samuelson, Bob Solow, James Tobin and so forth,
[02:36:42.280 --> 02:36:46.700]   Thomas Sowell, yes, that appreciates property,
[02:36:46.700 --> 02:36:49.240]   the virtues of free enterprise,
[02:36:49.240 --> 02:36:55.320]   the set of institutions that allow for security of contract,
[02:36:55.320 --> 02:36:59.120]   a rule of law, things of this kind.
[02:36:59.120 --> 02:37:02.120]   So that's one thing to say about my politics.
[02:37:02.120 --> 02:37:03.600]   Another thing to say about my politics,
[02:37:03.600 --> 02:37:06.120]   and you're right, I've moved around,
[02:37:06.120 --> 02:37:09.960]   is that I began South Side of Chicago, black kid,
[02:37:09.960 --> 02:37:11.560]   I was a liberal Democrat.
[02:37:12.400 --> 02:37:17.400]   I encountered the economics curriculum at the MIT
[02:37:17.400 --> 02:37:19.800]   and I became trained in economics
[02:37:19.800 --> 02:37:21.880]   in the tradition that I've just described.
[02:37:21.880 --> 02:37:27.480]   And I encountered also the Reagan Revolution.
[02:37:27.480 --> 02:37:30.480]   This is the late '70s and early '80s.
[02:37:30.480 --> 02:37:34.380]   These are big debates about economic policy and so on.
[02:37:34.380 --> 02:37:40.480]   And I found a lot to admire in the supply siders,
[02:37:41.320 --> 02:37:43.360]   the people who were saying,
[02:37:43.360 --> 02:37:45.240]   let's get the government out of the way,
[02:37:45.240 --> 02:37:47.440]   the people who were worried about national debt,
[02:37:47.440 --> 02:37:49.520]   which is a lot more now than it was then,
[02:37:49.520 --> 02:37:52.040]   the people who were worried that the welfare state
[02:37:52.040 --> 02:37:55.360]   could be too big, that the incentives of transfer programs
[02:37:55.360 --> 02:37:58.400]   could be counterproductive, that you had a war on poverty,
[02:37:58.400 --> 02:38:00.840]   and we did have a war on poverty, and poverty won.
[02:38:00.840 --> 02:38:04.400]   And there's a lot of evidence that the war on poverty
[02:38:04.400 --> 02:38:06.720]   was lost by the people who were trying to,
[02:38:06.720 --> 02:38:09.040]   quote unquote, eradicate poverty in our time.
[02:38:09.680 --> 02:38:13.520]   That incentives really do matter,
[02:38:13.520 --> 02:38:17.440]   and that the state, which is driven by politics,
[02:38:17.440 --> 02:38:20.640]   is often unresponsive to the dictates of incentives,
[02:38:20.640 --> 02:38:24.320]   whereas markets eliminate people who are inefficient
[02:38:24.320 --> 02:38:27.160]   and who are not cognizant of the consequences of incentives
[02:38:27.160 --> 02:38:29.360]   'cause they can't cover their bottom line
[02:38:29.360 --> 02:38:31.260]   and they won't persist for very long
[02:38:31.260 --> 02:38:32.560]   if they can't cover their bottom line.
[02:38:32.560 --> 02:38:35.720]   They're forced to respond to the realities of differences
[02:38:35.720 --> 02:38:37.400]   in costs and benefits and so forth
[02:38:37.400 --> 02:38:39.480]   in a way that governments can cover
[02:38:39.480 --> 02:38:41.920]   because they have their hand in our pocket.
[02:38:41.920 --> 02:38:45.600]   They can cover their losses and they can make accounts
[02:38:45.600 --> 02:38:47.280]   balanced notwithstanding their mistakes
[02:38:47.280 --> 02:38:50.960]   because they can take my property by fiat,
[02:38:50.960 --> 02:38:53.240]   by the power of the state, the tax collector comes,
[02:38:53.240 --> 02:38:56.000]   if I don't pay, he seizes my holdings,
[02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:59.060]   and they can carry on in that way.
[02:38:59.060 --> 02:39:02.800]   They need the corrective influence of markets
[02:39:02.800 --> 02:39:05.560]   in order to be responsive to the realities of life.
[02:39:05.560 --> 02:39:10.520]   I mean, I may not like it that prices are telling me
[02:39:10.520 --> 02:39:12.880]   that something that I wanna do is infeasible.
[02:39:12.880 --> 02:39:15.700]   I may not like it, but what the prices are telling me
[02:39:15.700 --> 02:39:20.300]   is that the costs of doing it exceed the benefits
[02:39:20.300 --> 02:39:22.040]   to be derived from doing it.
[02:39:22.040 --> 02:39:24.200]   And if I persist in doing it, notwithstanding that,
[02:39:24.200 --> 02:39:26.920]   I'm gonna run losses and those losses will accumulate.
[02:39:26.920 --> 02:39:30.840]   And the net effect of that over an entire society
[02:39:30.840 --> 02:39:34.520]   is stagnation and ultimate attenuation
[02:39:34.520 --> 02:39:36.840]   of the economic benefits that might be available
[02:39:36.840 --> 02:39:37.680]   with people.
[02:39:37.680 --> 02:39:40.600]   Again, I think if you look at the developing world
[02:39:40.600 --> 02:39:42.040]   in the post-colonial period,
[02:39:42.040 --> 02:39:43.960]   the second half of the 20th century,
[02:39:43.960 --> 02:39:46.000]   that's exactly what you see.
[02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:48.000]   Planning doesn't work.
[02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:50.680]   Centralized control over resource allocation doesn't work.
[02:39:50.680 --> 02:39:54.840]   Okay, so I became more conservative in that respect,
[02:39:54.840 --> 02:39:57.240]   but I also, and this has to do with race,
[02:39:57.240 --> 02:40:04.360]   lost faith in the posture of the state
[02:40:04.360 --> 02:40:07.680]   and the posture that what became
[02:40:07.680 --> 02:40:08.760]   of the Civil Rights Movement.
[02:40:08.760 --> 02:40:11.680]   I mean, the Civil Rights Movement, you quote King, 1963,
[02:40:11.680 --> 02:40:13.800]   the Civil Rights Movement starts out as,
[02:40:13.800 --> 02:40:17.880]   we want equal membership in the polity,
[02:40:17.880 --> 02:40:24.120]   but it becomes a systematized cover,
[02:40:24.120 --> 02:40:32.160]   I'm going to argue, for deficiencies
[02:40:32.160 --> 02:40:37.160]   that are discernible within black American society,
[02:40:37.160 --> 02:40:38.960]   which only we could correct.
[02:40:38.960 --> 02:40:41.640]   That's a very controversial statement.
[02:40:41.640 --> 02:40:43.520]   I make it with trepidation.
[02:40:43.520 --> 02:40:47.320]   I don't take any pleasure in saying it,
[02:40:47.320 --> 02:40:49.040]   but here's what I'm talking about.
[02:40:49.040 --> 02:40:52.320]   So I'm talking about the family.
[02:40:52.320 --> 02:40:58.280]   So the family is a matter internal to the community
[02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:03.280]   about how men and women relate to each other
[02:41:03.280 --> 02:41:06.500]   and engage in social reproduction, childbearing,
[02:41:06.500 --> 02:41:09.780]   the standing up of households,
[02:41:09.780 --> 02:41:12.320]   the context within which children are developed,
[02:41:12.320 --> 02:41:14.640]   are maturing, and so forth and so on.
[02:41:14.640 --> 02:41:17.720]   So the African-American family is in trouble.
[02:41:17.720 --> 02:41:20.920]   I think I can demonstrate that by reference
[02:41:20.920 --> 02:41:24.320]   to high rates of marital dissolution,
[02:41:24.320 --> 02:41:29.000]   by high rates of birth out of wedlock and so forth.
[02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:32.000]   You can't even say that,
[02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:34.720]   the African-American family is in trouble.
[02:41:34.720 --> 02:41:35.560]   Violence.
[02:41:35.560 --> 02:41:39.320]   Homicide is an order of magnitude more prevalent
[02:41:39.320 --> 02:41:40.440]   amongst African-Americans
[02:41:40.440 --> 02:41:43.020]   than it is in the society as a whole.
[02:41:43.020 --> 02:41:46.480]   This is behavior, it's behavior of our people.
[02:41:46.480 --> 02:41:47.600]   I speak of black people.
[02:41:47.600 --> 02:41:49.760]   Of course, we're not the only people in society
[02:41:49.760 --> 02:41:51.600]   for whom violence is an issue.
[02:41:51.600 --> 02:41:54.440]   It's an order of magnitude more prevalent
[02:41:54.440 --> 02:41:56.800]   in our communities.
[02:41:56.800 --> 02:42:00.160]   I'm talking about schooling and school failure.
[02:42:00.160 --> 02:42:02.800]   So we have affirmative action as a cover,
[02:42:02.800 --> 02:42:06.040]   it's a band-aid on differences in the development
[02:42:06.040 --> 02:42:07.980]   of intellectual performance,
[02:42:07.980 --> 02:42:10.260]   which is only partly a consequence
[02:42:10.260 --> 02:42:12.800]   of the natural intelligence of people,
[02:42:12.800 --> 02:42:16.720]   and largely a consequence of how people spend their time,
[02:42:16.720 --> 02:42:20.140]   what they value, how they discipline themselves,
[02:42:20.140 --> 02:42:23.760]   what they do with their opportunities,
[02:42:23.760 --> 02:42:25.880]   how parents raise their children,
[02:42:25.880 --> 02:42:28.520]   what peer groups value, and things of this kind.
[02:42:28.520 --> 02:42:30.920]   The Asian students who are scoring off the charts
[02:42:30.920 --> 02:42:33.220]   on these exams are doing it,
[02:42:33.220 --> 02:42:35.400]   not because they're intrinsically more intelligent
[02:42:35.400 --> 02:42:38.220]   to other people, but because they work harder,
[02:42:38.220 --> 02:42:39.840]   because their parents are more insistent
[02:42:39.840 --> 02:42:43.200]   on focusing on their intellectual performance,
[02:42:43.200 --> 02:42:45.100]   because they're disciplined,
[02:42:45.100 --> 02:42:46.880]   because of the way that they devote their time
[02:42:46.880 --> 02:42:50.400]   and their resources to equipping their children
[02:42:50.400 --> 02:42:52.560]   to function in the 21st century.
[02:42:52.560 --> 02:42:53.460]   This is what I believe.
[02:42:53.460 --> 02:42:55.500]   I think it's demonstrably the case,
[02:42:55.500 --> 02:43:00.140]   and it is a factor in racial disparity.
[02:43:00.140 --> 02:43:03.020]   The way that the civil rights movement has evolved
[02:43:03.020 --> 02:43:05.940]   under the wing of the Democratic Party
[02:43:05.940 --> 02:43:08.540]   into an organized apologia
[02:43:08.540 --> 02:43:12.660]   for the failures of African-Americans
[02:43:12.660 --> 02:43:16.020]   to seize the opportunities that exist for us now
[02:43:16.020 --> 02:43:19.320]   in the 21st century, but did not exist
[02:43:19.320 --> 02:43:21.140]   in the first half of the 20th century,
[02:43:21.140 --> 02:43:23.740]   the way in which the civil rights movement has become
[02:43:23.740 --> 02:43:28.340]   an avoidance mechanism for us not taking
[02:43:28.340 --> 02:43:29.940]   we African-Americans responsible,
[02:43:29.940 --> 02:43:33.260]   this is Glenn Lowry, not everybody's gonna agree with it,
[02:43:33.260 --> 02:43:36.780]   is part of what makes me a conservative.
[02:43:36.780 --> 02:43:38.940]   I am tired of the bellyaching.
[02:43:38.940 --> 02:43:41.520]   I'm tired of the excuse me, white supremacy.
[02:43:41.520 --> 02:43:45.660]   It is, in my mind, a joke.
[02:43:45.660 --> 02:43:49.260]   I lament the fact that that kind of rhetoric
[02:43:49.260 --> 02:43:53.900]   is so seductively attractive to African-Americans
[02:43:53.900 --> 02:43:57.520]   and so widely adopted by others.
[02:43:57.520 --> 02:44:02.860]   And as I am fond of saying, at the end of the day,
[02:44:02.860 --> 02:44:04.780]   nobody is coming to save us.
[02:44:04.780 --> 02:44:09.340]   I mean, higher education, MIT, Caltech, Stanford,
[02:44:09.340 --> 02:44:12.280]   where the future is happening,
[02:44:12.280 --> 02:44:17.940]   that is about mastery over the achievements
[02:44:17.940 --> 02:44:21.500]   of human civilization, such as they manifest themselves
[02:44:21.500 --> 02:44:22.340]   in the 21st century.
[02:44:22.340 --> 02:44:26.380]   There's no substitute for actually acquiring mastery
[02:44:26.380 --> 02:44:27.380]   over the material.
[02:44:27.380 --> 02:44:30.300]   There's no substitute for that.
[02:44:30.300 --> 02:44:34.900]   To be patronized, to have the standards lowered,
[02:44:34.900 --> 02:44:37.140]   they wanna get rid of the test.
[02:44:37.140 --> 02:44:40.240]   They wanna tell African-Americans to pat us on the head.
[02:44:40.240 --> 02:44:43.060]   We're gonna have a separate program for you.
[02:44:43.060 --> 02:44:45.860]   We're gonna give you a side door that you can come into.
[02:44:45.860 --> 02:44:48.100]   That doesn't make us any smarter.
[02:44:48.100 --> 02:44:49.960]   It doesn't make us any more creative.
[02:44:49.960 --> 02:44:54.860]   And it doesn't make us any more fit
[02:44:54.860 --> 02:44:58.400]   for the actual competition that's unfolding before us.
[02:44:58.400 --> 02:45:01.460]   Now, you wanna be 10% of the population
[02:45:01.460 --> 02:45:04.000]   that's carried along for the next 100 years?
[02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:09.000]   You wanna be a ward of the state in the late 21st century?
[02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:12.220]   You go ahead, because the Chinese are coming.
[02:45:12.220 --> 02:45:13.780]   You're not gonna hold them back.
[02:45:13.780 --> 02:45:16.380]   The world is being remade every decade
[02:45:16.380 --> 02:45:19.680]   by new ways of seeing and new ways of doing.
[02:45:19.680 --> 02:45:23.820]   If you don't get on board with the dynamic advancement
[02:45:23.820 --> 02:45:26.220]   of the civilization in which we are embedded,
[02:45:26.220 --> 02:45:29.460]   you're gonna end up being dependent on other people
[02:45:29.460 --> 02:45:31.420]   to look kindly upon you.
[02:45:31.420 --> 02:45:35.000]   And this story that you've got, this bellyache,
[02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:39.440]   this excuse, "Ancestors were slaves,"
[02:45:41.140 --> 02:45:45.140]   it's only gonna work for so long.
[02:45:45.140 --> 02:45:49.180]   So that makes me, I suppose, a kind of conservative.
[02:45:49.180 --> 02:45:51.460]   I hate affirmative action.
[02:45:51.460 --> 02:45:52.620]   I don't just disagree with it.
[02:45:52.620 --> 02:45:55.500]   I don't just think it's against the 14th Amendment.
[02:45:55.500 --> 02:45:57.060]   I hate it.
[02:45:57.060 --> 02:45:59.020]   The hatred comes from an understanding
[02:45:59.020 --> 02:46:01.540]   that it is a band-aid, that it is a substitute
[02:46:01.540 --> 02:46:03.900]   for the actual development of the capacities
[02:46:03.900 --> 02:46:05.700]   of our people to compete.
[02:46:05.700 --> 02:46:08.440]   I'd much rather be in the position
[02:46:08.440 --> 02:46:10.840]   of having them try to keep me out
[02:46:10.840 --> 02:46:12.740]   because I'm so damn good,
[02:46:12.740 --> 02:46:15.300]   like they're doing with the Asians,
[02:46:15.300 --> 02:46:18.480]   than having them have to beg the Supreme Court
[02:46:18.480 --> 02:46:21.220]   to allow for a special dispensation on my behalf
[02:46:21.220 --> 02:46:25.740]   because they need diversity and inclusion and belonging.
[02:46:25.740 --> 02:46:27.180]   It's not just diversity.
[02:46:27.180 --> 02:46:28.660]   It's not just diversity and inclusion.
[02:46:28.660 --> 02:46:31.640]   It's diversity and inclusion and belonging.
[02:46:31.640 --> 02:46:34.660]   I'm whining because I feel like I don't belong.
[02:46:34.660 --> 02:46:37.500]   That's a position of weakness.
[02:46:37.500 --> 02:46:38.860]   It's pathetic.
[02:46:40.300 --> 02:46:42.220]   And it's only political correctness
[02:46:42.220 --> 02:46:43.900]   that keeps people who can see this,
[02:46:43.900 --> 02:46:46.060]   and believe me, a lot of people can see it,
[02:46:46.060 --> 02:46:49.300]   from saying so out loud.
[02:46:49.300 --> 02:46:52.300]   - So you want the black American community
[02:46:52.300 --> 02:46:54.300]   to represent strength?
[02:46:54.300 --> 02:46:57.020]   - Correct, and I want us to deal with what it is
[02:46:57.020 --> 02:46:58.780]   that we have to deal with in order to be able
[02:46:58.780 --> 02:47:03.780]   to project strength in an increasingly competitive world.
[02:47:03.780 --> 02:47:06.500]   - Let me ask you,
[02:47:09.020 --> 02:47:10.580]   I know you said you're angry
[02:47:10.580 --> 02:47:14.140]   or dislike affirmative action.
[02:47:14.140 --> 02:47:16.060]   Let me ask you about something
[02:47:16.060 --> 02:47:19.220]   that even to my ear cut wrong.
[02:47:19.220 --> 02:47:23.060]   Now I'm relatively apolitical.
[02:47:23.060 --> 02:47:27.220]   So President Biden, when he was running for president,
[02:47:27.220 --> 02:47:31.620]   gave a campaign promise that he will nominate a black woman
[02:47:31.620 --> 02:47:34.460]   to the US Supreme Court, saying, quote,
[02:47:34.460 --> 02:47:37.060]   "The person I will nominate will be someone
[02:47:37.060 --> 02:47:39.700]   "with extraordinary qualifications, character,
[02:47:39.700 --> 02:47:43.100]   "experience, and integrity," first sentence.
[02:47:43.100 --> 02:47:45.580]   Second sentence, "And that person will be
[02:47:45.580 --> 02:47:47.900]   "the first black woman ever nominated
[02:47:47.900 --> 02:47:50.720]   "to the United States Supreme Court."
[02:47:50.720 --> 02:47:53.180]   Do you wish he only said the first sentence
[02:47:53.180 --> 02:47:54.420]   and not the second?
[02:47:54.420 --> 02:47:58.780]   - Yes, I wish that he had only said the first sentence,
[02:47:58.780 --> 02:48:01.000]   even if his intention was to do what he said
[02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:03.580]   he was gonna do in the second sentence.
[02:48:03.580 --> 02:48:06.300]   In other words, I wish that he had simply said,
[02:48:06.300 --> 02:48:07.980]   if I have the opportunity to nominate someone
[02:48:07.980 --> 02:48:09.340]   to the Supreme Court, it's gonna be
[02:48:09.340 --> 02:48:13.060]   a superbly qualified person to carry out that position.
[02:48:13.060 --> 02:48:15.420]   And he might've kept to himself his intention
[02:48:15.420 --> 02:48:18.700]   to name an African-American woman to that position,
[02:48:18.700 --> 02:48:21.060]   and then going ahead and named an African-American woman
[02:48:21.060 --> 02:48:25.420]   to that position, and I'm sure that Katonji Brown-Jackson.
[02:48:25.420 --> 02:48:27.220]   I don't doubt that she's exceptionally qualified.
[02:48:27.220 --> 02:48:28.660]   She has a distinguished career.
[02:48:28.660 --> 02:48:31.700]   She served as a judge on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.
[02:48:31.700 --> 02:48:33.060]   She's a graduate of Harvard Law School.
[02:48:33.060 --> 02:48:34.700]   She has a background.
[02:48:34.700 --> 02:48:39.580]   You do not have to be a world-class
[02:48:39.580 --> 02:48:41.820]   constitutional legal scholar to get onto
[02:48:41.820 --> 02:48:43.700]   the United States Supreme Court.
[02:48:43.700 --> 02:48:45.860]   A lot of members of the United States Supreme Court
[02:48:45.860 --> 02:48:48.580]   have had different kinds of legal careers
[02:48:48.580 --> 02:48:50.700]   before they were elevated to that position.
[02:48:50.700 --> 02:48:56.580]   Earl Warren of the famed Warren Court of the 1950s and '60s
[02:48:56.580 --> 02:49:01.140]   was a politician as well as a leading jurist and whatnot.
[02:49:01.140 --> 02:49:03.220]   I mean, many kinds of people in the US Supreme Court.
[02:49:03.220 --> 02:49:06.980]   I have no doubt that Judge Katonji Brown-Jackson
[02:49:06.980 --> 02:49:10.140]   is a qualified member to be on the Supreme Court.
[02:49:10.140 --> 02:49:13.820]   I wish that Biden had not done what he did.
[02:49:13.820 --> 02:49:16.180]   He could have just appointed a black woman
[02:49:16.180 --> 02:49:18.900]   by saying that he was limiting his considerations
[02:49:18.900 --> 02:49:20.460]   to black women, and what are black women
[02:49:20.460 --> 02:49:23.460]   as a percentage of all potential appointees
[02:49:23.460 --> 02:49:24.980]   to the Supreme Court?
[02:49:24.980 --> 02:49:26.660]   3%?
[02:49:26.660 --> 02:49:27.500]   4%?
[02:49:27.500 --> 02:49:29.020]   I don't know, we could look the number up.
[02:49:30.740 --> 02:49:33.500]   By saying that, he puts an asterisk on the appointment,
[02:49:33.500 --> 02:49:34.780]   but it's worse than that,
[02:49:34.780 --> 02:49:38.980]   because she will live down the asterisk
[02:49:38.980 --> 02:49:42.340]   if a person is inclined to do that.
[02:49:42.340 --> 02:49:45.900]   She will have the opportunity to show through her performance
[02:49:45.900 --> 02:49:47.300]   exactly what kind of jurist she is,
[02:49:47.300 --> 02:49:49.860]   just as Justice Clarence Thomas has shown
[02:49:49.860 --> 02:49:52.740]   through his performance that he was qualified
[02:49:52.740 --> 02:49:53.900]   and more than qualified to be
[02:49:53.900 --> 02:49:56.300]   on the United States Supreme Court.
[02:49:57.500 --> 02:49:59.740]   What I disliked was the pandering.
[02:49:59.740 --> 02:50:06.260]   He was seeking votes from black people by pandering to us,
[02:50:06.260 --> 02:50:09.020]   and he's treating us like children.
[02:50:09.020 --> 02:50:12.140]   Why should I care what color the person is
[02:50:12.140 --> 02:50:14.420]   who's on the United States Supreme Court?
[02:50:14.420 --> 02:50:17.700]   What I should care about is what kind of opinions
[02:50:17.700 --> 02:50:20.020]   they're gonna write when they're on the United States.
[02:50:20.020 --> 02:50:22.020]   Do I suppose that being a black woman
[02:50:22.020 --> 02:50:23.940]   means that you're gonna write different kind of opinions
[02:50:23.940 --> 02:50:24.780]   than others?
[02:50:24.780 --> 02:50:27.500]   Perhaps, perhaps.
[02:50:27.500 --> 02:50:30.700]   That kind of identity politics
[02:50:30.700 --> 02:50:35.100]   at the highest level of American legal establishment
[02:50:35.100 --> 02:50:38.820]   is something that rubs me very much the wrong way.
[02:50:38.820 --> 02:50:42.700]   What I should care about is the nature
[02:50:42.700 --> 02:50:43.740]   and the future of the law.
[02:50:43.740 --> 02:50:45.660]   I'm actually struck by this
[02:50:45.660 --> 02:50:49.820]   because the court is conservative.
[02:50:49.820 --> 02:50:53.780]   It has six conservative members on it,
[02:50:53.780 --> 02:50:56.340]   and it has three liberal members on it.
[02:50:56.340 --> 02:51:02.660]   And if I were, and I'm not a liberal Democrat,
[02:51:02.660 --> 02:51:04.860]   the highest concern that I would have
[02:51:04.860 --> 02:51:07.500]   about an appointment to the Supreme Court is,
[02:51:07.500 --> 02:51:11.020]   is this a person who is going to be effective
[02:51:11.020 --> 02:51:13.980]   in advocating my liberal views
[02:51:13.980 --> 02:51:16.980]   within the highest council of American law?
[02:51:16.980 --> 02:51:19.940]   Now, the fact that that person is a woman
[02:51:19.940 --> 02:51:23.140]   or is a black person is way down the list
[02:51:23.140 --> 02:51:26.300]   of the things that I would think are important
[02:51:26.300 --> 02:51:29.620]   to the kinds of opinions that they're going to write.
[02:51:29.620 --> 02:51:33.340]   So, I mean, I think Joe Biden,
[02:51:33.340 --> 02:51:39.380]   this is just a piece of a larger political strategy
[02:51:39.380 --> 02:51:41.620]   to cobble together a coalition
[02:51:41.620 --> 02:51:43.940]   that'll be successful at the polls
[02:51:43.940 --> 02:51:45.620]   in sustaining Democrats.
[02:51:45.620 --> 02:51:49.900]   Jim Crow 2.0, this whole characterization
[02:51:49.900 --> 02:51:52.860]   of the conflict in the States
[02:51:52.860 --> 02:51:56.100]   about election security and voting rights
[02:51:56.100 --> 02:51:58.420]   is another part of that strategy.
[02:51:58.420 --> 02:52:01.900]   He is pandering to black voters.
[02:52:01.900 --> 02:52:04.900]   He is trying to frighten us,
[02:52:04.900 --> 02:52:06.860]   thinking that if the Republicans win,
[02:52:06.860 --> 02:52:08.660]   our rights will be taken away.
[02:52:08.660 --> 02:52:14.660]   And I think it is a infantilization
[02:52:14.660 --> 02:52:16.300]   of African-American politics.
[02:52:16.300 --> 02:52:20.300]   I think black people ought not to be as concerned
[02:52:20.300 --> 02:52:21.740]   about the color of the skin
[02:52:21.740 --> 02:52:23.900]   of a person who is serving in government
[02:52:23.900 --> 02:52:26.860]   as they are about the content of their character
[02:52:26.860 --> 02:52:30.620]   and the focus of their political
[02:52:30.620 --> 02:52:32.740]   and ideological orientation,
[02:52:32.740 --> 02:52:37.300]   which for me would be center or even center-right,
[02:52:37.300 --> 02:52:38.980]   but that's me.
[02:52:38.980 --> 02:52:41.380]   - And it should not have a significant impact.
[02:52:41.380 --> 02:52:43.860]   Nevertheless, he said she can overcome the asterisk,
[02:52:43.860 --> 02:52:46.220]   but to me, it was deeply disrespectful
[02:52:46.220 --> 02:52:50.300]   that anyone would give an extra asterisk
[02:52:50.300 --> 02:52:51.620]   to have to overcome.
[02:52:51.620 --> 02:52:52.780]   He didn't have to say it.
[02:52:52.780 --> 02:52:53.980]   All he had to do was do it.
[02:52:53.980 --> 02:52:55.620]   If he wanted to put a black woman on the court,
[02:52:55.620 --> 02:52:57.380]   then he could have just gone ahead and done it.
[02:52:57.380 --> 02:52:59.700]   The reason he said it is because he wanted black people
[02:52:59.700 --> 02:53:01.500]   to vote for him by saying it.
[02:53:01.500 --> 02:53:04.460]   And I'm saying that treats us like we're children.
[02:53:04.460 --> 02:53:05.700]   - It's not a political statement.
[02:53:05.700 --> 02:53:06.780]   I just thought as a leader,
[02:53:06.780 --> 02:53:11.260]   that was not, that was kind of disgusting.
[02:53:11.260 --> 02:53:13.820]   Let me ask you about Thomas Sowell.
[02:53:13.820 --> 02:53:14.740]   You mentioned him.
[02:53:14.740 --> 02:53:19.300]   He's a colleague and somebody who was an influence.
[02:53:19.300 --> 02:53:22.580]   What, in the space of ideas,
[02:53:22.580 --> 02:53:27.580]   so what broadly, what impact has he had on your ideas?
[02:53:27.580 --> 02:53:32.980]   And how do you think he shaped the landscape of ideas
[02:53:32.980 --> 02:53:35.100]   in our culture in general?
[02:53:35.100 --> 02:53:37.500]   - I think Thomas Sowell, he's in his 90s now.
[02:53:37.500 --> 02:53:39.100]   He's been around for a long time.
[02:53:39.100 --> 02:53:40.260]   - He's still got it.
[02:53:40.260 --> 02:53:41.340]   He's still going at it.
[02:53:41.340 --> 02:53:42.180]   - He's still going at it.
[02:53:42.180 --> 02:53:43.140]   Books continue to come out.
[02:53:43.140 --> 02:53:44.380]   I think he's a great man.
[02:53:44.380 --> 02:53:49.020]   I think Thomas Sowell, regardless of his race,
[02:53:49.020 --> 02:53:54.020]   he's black, is one of the 100
[02:53:54.020 --> 02:53:57.780]   most significant economists of the 20th century.
[02:53:57.780 --> 02:53:59.620]   He has chosen as his subject,
[02:53:59.620 --> 02:54:01.300]   a substantial part of his subject,
[02:54:01.300 --> 02:54:04.940]   subject to investigate the deep causes
[02:54:04.940 --> 02:54:07.980]   and consequences of racial disparity
[02:54:07.980 --> 02:54:09.660]   of one kind or another.
[02:54:09.660 --> 02:54:12.860]   He's written fundamental books about that.
[02:54:12.860 --> 02:54:15.620]   Many of them.
[02:54:15.620 --> 02:54:17.700]   He's a social philosopher.
[02:54:17.700 --> 02:54:20.700]   He is a economic historian.
[02:54:20.700 --> 02:54:25.700]   He is a combatant in the conflict of ideas
[02:54:25.700 --> 02:54:27.740]   around how to think about society
[02:54:27.740 --> 02:54:30.180]   and this beyond racial differences,
[02:54:30.180 --> 02:54:32.020]   although race has been a big part of
[02:54:32.020 --> 02:54:33.220]   what he's written about.
[02:54:33.220 --> 02:54:35.380]   He's been critical of affirmative action,
[02:54:35.380 --> 02:54:37.900]   and he didn't just stand back and wag his finger.
[02:54:37.900 --> 02:54:39.780]   He got busy looking at the consequences
[02:54:39.780 --> 02:54:42.660]   of affirmative action in societies all around the world,
[02:54:42.660 --> 02:54:44.580]   and he's written books about that.
[02:54:44.580 --> 02:54:47.380]   He's been critical of the narrative
[02:54:47.380 --> 02:54:50.300]   about civil rights and racial inequality.
[02:54:50.300 --> 02:54:51.740]   He believes in small government.
[02:54:51.740 --> 02:54:55.580]   He doesn't think that efforts to redistribute income
[02:54:55.580 --> 02:54:57.340]   have proved to be the solution
[02:54:57.340 --> 02:55:00.220]   to the problem of racial disparity.
[02:55:00.220 --> 02:55:02.700]   Tom has not been honored by the committee
[02:55:02.700 --> 02:55:06.780]   that hands out Nobel recognition in economic science
[02:55:06.780 --> 02:55:09.380]   and probably won't be because he's controversial,
[02:55:09.380 --> 02:55:13.300]   and I reckon that that committee would be loath
[02:55:13.300 --> 02:55:16.500]   to encourage the blowback that they would be sure to receive
[02:55:16.500 --> 02:55:19.300]   if they were to take a controversial
[02:55:19.300 --> 02:55:23.700]   and politically focused and expressive
[02:55:23.700 --> 02:55:26.460]   black conservative and honor in that way.
[02:55:26.460 --> 02:55:29.020]   So I think another reason is that Tom,
[02:55:29.020 --> 02:55:31.900]   as a methodological matter,
[02:55:31.900 --> 02:55:34.220]   is not especially quantitative.
[02:55:34.220 --> 02:55:35.340]   He pays attention to data,
[02:55:35.340 --> 02:55:37.860]   but he doesn't do statistical analysis,
[02:55:37.860 --> 02:55:39.820]   and he doesn't do modeling.
[02:55:39.820 --> 02:55:41.700]   So from a methodological point of view,
[02:55:41.700 --> 02:55:43.860]   he's not a cutting edge,
[02:55:43.860 --> 02:55:47.740]   kind of mathematically sophisticated,
[02:55:47.740 --> 02:55:51.700]   kind of quantitatively statistically oriented,
[02:55:51.700 --> 02:55:53.100]   but he does descriptive stuff.
[02:55:53.100 --> 02:55:56.740]   He writes in a style that is much more
[02:55:56.740 --> 02:55:59.420]   like a social historian than it is
[02:55:59.420 --> 02:56:04.100]   like a mathematically trained analytical economist.
[02:56:04.100 --> 02:56:04.940]   On the other hand,
[02:56:04.940 --> 02:56:07.420]   he is an economist in the Chicago School,
[02:56:07.420 --> 02:56:09.900]   Milton Friedman and George Stickler,
[02:56:09.900 --> 02:56:11.860]   prominent amongst his teachers,
[02:56:11.860 --> 02:56:15.140]   who takes price theory,
[02:56:15.140 --> 02:56:20.140]   which is the analysis of the interplay of market forces,
[02:56:20.140 --> 02:56:24.100]   mindful of incentives,
[02:56:24.100 --> 02:56:29.100]   and so on to implement the basic insights
[02:56:29.100 --> 02:56:32.060]   from economic science.
[02:56:32.060 --> 02:56:33.060]   There is no free lunch.
[02:56:33.060 --> 02:56:34.420]   I mean, there's always gonna be a cost
[02:56:34.420 --> 02:56:36.420]   to anything that you do and so on.
[02:56:36.420 --> 02:56:37.660]   People respond to incentives,
[02:56:37.660 --> 02:56:39.180]   demand curve slope downward.
[02:56:40.180 --> 02:56:42.100]   You know, competition tends to work best
[02:56:42.100 --> 02:56:44.980]   when people are free to enter and not, and so on.
[02:56:44.980 --> 02:56:46.780]   I mean, that kind of thing.
[02:56:46.780 --> 02:56:51.700]   But Tom is also a social historian and a philosopher
[02:56:51.700 --> 02:56:54.820]   in the tradition of Friedrich von Hayek.
[02:56:54.820 --> 02:56:57.820]   One of Tom's books I've deeply admired,
[02:56:57.820 --> 02:56:59.900]   "Knowledge and Decisions,"
[02:56:59.900 --> 02:57:02.980]   is an extension of the Hayekian arguments
[02:57:02.980 --> 02:57:07.980]   about the limits of central planning and whatnot.
[02:57:08.980 --> 02:57:13.140]   So I think Tom Sowell, Thomas Sowell,
[02:57:13.140 --> 02:57:17.460]   African-American, born, as I understand it, in Louisiana,
[02:57:17.460 --> 02:57:20.500]   raised in New York City,
[02:57:20.500 --> 02:57:23.780]   graduate of Harvard College, a military veteran,
[02:57:23.780 --> 02:57:29.100]   a PhD in economics from the University of Chicago,
[02:57:29.100 --> 02:57:31.700]   a black conservative social scientist
[02:57:31.700 --> 02:57:33.380]   of very high stature.
[02:57:33.380 --> 02:57:34.500]   I think he's a great man.
[02:57:34.500 --> 02:57:37.740]   - And one of the great intellectuals of the 20th century.
[02:57:37.740 --> 02:57:42.740]   And you're saying implicitly deserves a Nobel Prize.
[02:57:42.740 --> 02:57:45.420]   - Yeah, I do think so.
[02:57:45.420 --> 02:57:49.780]   I mean, Hayek was awarded by the committee.
[02:57:49.780 --> 02:57:53.100]   Gunnar Myrdal, the Swedish economist
[02:57:53.100 --> 02:57:54.380]   who wrote about economic development,
[02:57:54.380 --> 02:57:56.420]   wrote a famous two-volume work,
[02:57:56.420 --> 02:57:59.380]   "An American Dilemma" about the status of blacks.
[02:57:59.380 --> 02:58:03.580]   I mean, I think Tom could be, you know,
[02:58:03.580 --> 02:58:06.020]   put in that company very easily without any difficulty.
[02:58:06.020 --> 02:58:07.060]   - I agree.
[02:58:07.060 --> 02:58:09.900]   - Daniel Kahneman, so it doesn't have to be numerical.
[02:58:09.900 --> 02:58:11.980]   - Psychologist, United Economist,
[02:58:11.980 --> 02:58:15.900]   Eleanor Ostrom, the political scientist
[02:58:15.900 --> 02:58:17.980]   who was honored in a joint prize given to her
[02:58:17.980 --> 02:58:21.860]   and Oliver Williamson 15 years ago or so.
[02:58:21.860 --> 02:58:24.620]   He could be put in that company really quite easily.
[02:58:24.620 --> 02:58:29.780]   - Let me ask you, you mentioned Obama in the very beginning
[02:58:29.780 --> 02:58:31.140]   that we were talking about.
[02:58:34.260 --> 02:58:38.140]   How did it feel that seems like forever ago,
[02:58:38.140 --> 02:58:41.740]   that in 2008, Barack Obama became president?
[02:58:41.740 --> 02:58:45.820]   Now at that time, perhaps you identified
[02:58:45.820 --> 02:58:48.940]   as conservative already, but how did,
[02:58:48.940 --> 02:58:53.940]   so politics aside, just in general,
[02:58:53.940 --> 02:58:59.860]   how did it feel that in 150 years
[02:58:59.860 --> 02:59:01.580]   where this country has come along?
[02:59:03.260 --> 02:59:07.300]   - Well, yeah, I didn't identify in 2008
[02:59:07.300 --> 02:59:10.740]   as a conservative to the same extent that I do today.
[02:59:10.740 --> 02:59:15.940]   I was kind of in transition yet again.
[02:59:15.940 --> 02:59:18.340]   I was excited by the Obama candidacy.
[02:59:18.340 --> 02:59:23.100]   At first I was skeptical because after all, he's not black.
[02:59:23.100 --> 02:59:27.380]   The man's father is a Kenyan
[02:59:27.380 --> 02:59:31.780]   and the man's mother is a white American
[02:59:31.780 --> 02:59:34.980]   and he identifies as black.
[02:59:34.980 --> 02:59:38.660]   I find it interesting that the first black president
[02:59:38.660 --> 02:59:41.100]   of the United States, and I could have put inverted commas
[02:59:41.100 --> 02:59:43.980]   around black, and the first black vice president
[02:59:43.980 --> 02:59:45.860]   of the United States,
[02:59:45.860 --> 02:59:48.380]   neither of them descend from American slaves.
[02:59:48.380 --> 02:59:54.660]   Kamala Harris's father is of African ancestry in part.
[02:59:54.660 --> 02:59:55.940]   He's a Jamaican immigrant
[02:59:55.940 --> 03:00:00.260]   and her mother is an Indian immigrant.
[03:00:00.260 --> 03:00:05.260]   She was Kamala Harris raised up largely in Canada,
[03:00:05.260 --> 03:00:11.300]   though born in the United States.
[03:00:11.300 --> 03:00:17.260]   Barack Obama is, as I've said, of mixed ancestry
[03:00:17.260 --> 03:00:20.140]   and neither of his parents are the descendants
[03:00:20.140 --> 03:00:25.140]   of American descendants of African slaves.
[03:00:26.260 --> 03:00:30.940]   But blackness is flexible.
[03:00:30.940 --> 03:00:35.380]   It's something that you can put on
[03:00:35.380 --> 03:00:38.500]   or you can take off to a certain degree for some people
[03:00:38.500 --> 03:00:41.580]   and so be it.
[03:00:41.580 --> 03:00:43.220]   I was excited.
[03:00:43.220 --> 03:00:44.540]   Our time has come.
[03:00:44.540 --> 03:00:47.220]   Hope and change.
[03:00:47.220 --> 03:00:51.060]   We are the ones we've been waiting for.
[03:00:51.060 --> 03:00:53.020]   These are slogans from 2008.
[03:00:54.580 --> 03:00:57.500]   I can't believe I bought that crap.
[03:00:57.500 --> 03:00:58.340]   - Oh, interesting.
[03:00:58.340 --> 03:01:00.060]   Let me push back here.
[03:01:00.060 --> 03:01:04.060]   You talked about, I mean, to me, a Jew is a Jew.
[03:01:04.060 --> 03:01:07.700]   Skin color is skin color.
[03:01:07.700 --> 03:01:15.100]   I mean, Barack Obama is black when it matters,
[03:01:15.100 --> 03:01:20.740]   when you're talking to a white supremacist,
[03:01:20.740 --> 03:01:25.740]   when you're talking to, if you're a slave owner, he's black.
[03:01:25.740 --> 03:01:30.660]   Just like you said, when Hitler comes around,
[03:01:30.660 --> 03:01:31.580]   a Jew is a Jew.
[03:01:31.580 --> 03:01:35.780]   It doesn't matter how you identify, doesn't matter what.
[03:01:35.780 --> 03:01:40.220]   So in that sense, don't you think that Barack Obama
[03:01:40.220 --> 03:01:43.380]   is black in the most powerful of ways,
[03:01:43.380 --> 03:01:48.380]   which is designating how far the MLK, the Dr. King vision?
[03:01:48.380 --> 03:01:50.140]   - Oh, sure.
[03:01:50.140 --> 03:01:52.740]   And look, I said it a little bit tongue in cheek.
[03:01:52.740 --> 03:01:54.100]   - Yes, yes, of course.
[03:01:54.100 --> 03:01:57.140]   - But I think Obama has been very careful
[03:01:57.140 --> 03:02:00.860]   about manufacturing a kind of public persona
[03:02:00.860 --> 03:02:05.860]   that is intended to position him in the most effective way.
[03:02:05.860 --> 03:02:10.780]   - You mean like every politician?
[03:02:10.780 --> 03:02:12.580]   - Yeah, like every politician, sure.
[03:02:12.580 --> 03:02:17.180]   And that the racial identity piece is an aspect of that.
[03:02:17.180 --> 03:02:21.300]   I mean, anything I say here would only be speculation
[03:02:21.300 --> 03:02:24.180]   because I have no facts about the personal history
[03:02:24.180 --> 03:02:25.020]   of Barack Obama.
[03:02:25.020 --> 03:02:27.060]   And I accept Barack Hussein Obama,
[03:02:27.060 --> 03:02:29.180]   as Hillary Clinton once said,
[03:02:29.180 --> 03:02:34.180]   I take him at his word about whatever she was talking about.
[03:02:34.180 --> 03:02:35.820]   Well, was he a Christian?
[03:02:35.820 --> 03:02:37.700]   I think is what the question was.
[03:02:37.700 --> 03:02:40.860]   And there was some right wing attack on Obama
[03:02:40.860 --> 03:02:45.540]   for having been raised for some years in the Philippines
[03:02:45.540 --> 03:02:48.420]   and all of that, or Indonesia, I beg your pardon,
[03:02:48.420 --> 03:02:51.540]   in Indonesia and his stepfather and all of that.
[03:02:51.540 --> 03:02:54.940]   But she took him at his word and I take him at his word
[03:02:54.940 --> 03:02:58.100]   about his racial identity.
[03:02:58.100 --> 03:02:58.940]   No.
[03:02:58.940 --> 03:03:01.700]   - But you were captivated by the power of his words
[03:03:01.700 --> 03:03:04.380]   and you regret to the degree you were captivated.
[03:03:04.380 --> 03:03:06.420]   - Well, I mean, I think in retrospect,
[03:03:06.420 --> 03:03:09.900]   that whole campaign looks like a pie in the sky
[03:03:09.900 --> 03:03:13.140]   kind of fairy tale.
[03:03:13.140 --> 03:03:15.780]   We are the ones we've been waiting for.
[03:03:15.780 --> 03:03:17.860]   I can't quote exactly that speech
[03:03:17.860 --> 03:03:19.860]   that he gave in Grant Park in Chicago
[03:03:19.860 --> 03:03:23.740]   when he was announced as the winner of the election.
[03:03:23.740 --> 03:03:27.500]   But today is the day that the rise of the ocean stopped,
[03:03:27.500 --> 03:03:28.900]   or words to this effect.
[03:03:28.900 --> 03:03:32.820]   I mean, those who doubted that we could do it,
[03:03:32.820 --> 03:03:35.420]   that tonight is your answer, this was gonna be a new day,
[03:03:35.420 --> 03:03:36.980]   it was gonna be a new regime.
[03:03:36.980 --> 03:03:40.100]   Well, it wasn't a new day and it wasn't a new regime.
[03:03:40.100 --> 03:03:43.140]   It was American politics more or less as usual.
[03:03:43.140 --> 03:03:46.380]   Barack Obama turns out not to be the Messiah.
[03:03:46.380 --> 03:03:48.480]   Maybe there should be no surprise in that.
[03:03:48.480 --> 03:03:52.640]   Race relations got set back during Obama's tenure.
[03:03:52.640 --> 03:03:57.900]   My beef with Obama is that, okay, you're black.
[03:03:57.900 --> 03:03:59.580]   You say you're black, you're black.
[03:03:59.580 --> 03:04:02.300]   You got elected, now we have a black president.
[03:04:02.300 --> 03:04:04.140]   A black president.
[03:04:04.140 --> 03:04:07.880]   You can do stuff that nobody else could do.
[03:04:09.060 --> 03:04:11.020]   You're a black president.
[03:04:11.020 --> 03:04:13.860]   You could tell the people burning down the city
[03:04:13.860 --> 03:04:17.580]   to get their butts back in their houses and to stop it.
[03:04:17.580 --> 03:04:22.980]   You could tell the race hustlers,
[03:04:22.980 --> 03:04:24.520]   the Al Sharptons of the world,
[03:04:24.520 --> 03:04:28.260]   not only has our time come,
[03:04:28.260 --> 03:04:30.740]   for those who supported my campaign,
[03:04:30.740 --> 03:04:34.740]   your time is over for those who wanna carry on
[03:04:36.140 --> 03:04:40.260]   a advocacy rooted in racial grievance.
[03:04:40.260 --> 03:04:44.060]   The election of myself to this highest office proves
[03:04:44.060 --> 03:04:46.720]   that the institution of this state are legitimate
[03:04:46.720 --> 03:04:49.220]   and open to all comers.
[03:04:49.220 --> 03:04:55.160]   I think Barack Obama, when the SHIT hit the fan,
[03:04:55.160 --> 03:04:58.220]   if I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.
[03:04:58.220 --> 03:05:00.180]   I deeply regret that he said that.
[03:05:00.180 --> 03:05:02.460]   He's president of the United States.
[03:05:02.460 --> 03:05:06.500]   The color of his skin and the color of Trayvon's skin,
[03:05:06.500 --> 03:05:08.100]   the correlation between those two things,
[03:05:08.100 --> 03:05:09.460]   if I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.
[03:05:09.460 --> 03:05:12.340]   Now he says, when he said it,
[03:05:12.340 --> 03:05:15.660]   he only meant to sympathize with the parents.
[03:05:15.660 --> 03:05:16.940]   But in fact, when he said it
[03:05:16.940 --> 03:05:19.460]   from the highest office in the land,
[03:05:19.460 --> 03:05:21.580]   and then sent his attorney general, Eric Holder,
[03:05:21.580 --> 03:05:24.660]   out to enforce this narrative,
[03:05:24.660 --> 03:05:27.460]   he doubled down on a racial narrative
[03:05:27.460 --> 03:05:29.980]   that I think is actually false.
[03:05:29.980 --> 03:05:34.940]   I think the story that systemic racism in America
[03:05:34.940 --> 03:05:38.300]   as reflected in policing that terrorizes black people
[03:05:38.300 --> 03:05:42.700]   because of the color of their skin is demonstrably false.
[03:05:42.700 --> 03:05:47.380]   I think that the central threat to black lives
[03:05:47.380 --> 03:05:52.380]   is violent crime perpetrated largely by black people
[03:05:52.380 --> 03:05:54.440]   against other black people.
[03:05:54.440 --> 03:05:56.300]   I think there is such a thing as police brutality,
[03:05:56.300 --> 03:05:58.820]   and I think there are reasons to have regulations of police,
[03:05:58.820 --> 03:06:02.240]   but I think it is a second order issue
[03:06:02.240 --> 03:06:06.980]   in terms of the quality of life of African-Americans.
[03:06:06.980 --> 03:06:08.820]   I think Obama could have told the people
[03:06:08.820 --> 03:06:11.980]   who after Freddie Gray died in police custody
[03:06:11.980 --> 03:06:14.060]   in a van in Baltimore,
[03:06:14.060 --> 03:06:16.800]   and who undertook to burn that city down,
[03:06:16.800 --> 03:06:19.260]   to get their asses off the street
[03:06:19.260 --> 03:06:21.060]   and go back to their apartments and stop it.
[03:06:21.060 --> 03:06:22.820]   I think he could have said in the aftermath
[03:06:22.820 --> 03:06:26.560]   of Michael Brown being shot dead by Darren Wilson
[03:06:26.560 --> 03:06:27.900]   in Ferguson, Missouri,
[03:06:27.900 --> 03:06:30.740]   and there was a grand jury deliberation
[03:06:30.740 --> 03:06:34.060]   that elected not to indict Officer Wilson,
[03:06:34.060 --> 03:06:35.700]   and people took to streets in that city
[03:06:35.700 --> 03:06:39.260]   and stood on top of vehicles and so forth and so on.
[03:06:39.260 --> 03:06:40.740]   He could have told them,
[03:06:40.740 --> 03:06:43.620]   "We don't mob around courthouses in this country.
[03:06:43.620 --> 03:06:45.920]   "We respect the rule of law.
[03:06:45.920 --> 03:06:48.400]   "Get your butts off the streets
[03:06:48.400 --> 03:06:49.820]   "and back into your apartments."
[03:06:49.820 --> 03:06:50.860]   He didn't do that.
[03:06:50.860 --> 03:06:53.380]   So--
[03:06:53.380 --> 03:06:54.660]   - To push back a little bit.
[03:06:54.660 --> 03:06:56.740]   - Yeah, good, push back.
[03:06:56.740 --> 03:06:59.620]   - I think you're asking Barack Obama,
[03:06:59.620 --> 03:07:04.460]   the first black president of the United States,
[03:07:04.460 --> 03:07:07.240]   to do the thing that I think should be done
[03:07:07.240 --> 03:07:09.740]   by the second black president of the United States.
[03:07:09.740 --> 03:07:11.780]   I think his very example,
[03:07:11.780 --> 03:07:13.400]   given the color of his skin,
[03:07:13.400 --> 03:07:17.480]   was the most powerful thing.
[03:07:17.480 --> 03:07:22.480]   And actually doing some of these hard Thomas Sowell type of,
[03:07:22.820 --> 03:07:26.940]   Glenn Loury type of strong words about race,
[03:07:26.940 --> 03:07:28.780]   it may be too much to ask,
[03:07:28.780 --> 03:07:31.660]   given the nature of modern day politics.
[03:07:31.660 --> 03:07:33.260]   He is a politician.
[03:07:33.260 --> 03:07:34.140]   - He is a politician.
[03:07:34.140 --> 03:07:35.180]   He needed to get elected. - We are playing politics.
[03:07:35.180 --> 03:07:36.820]   - He needed to get reelected.
[03:07:36.820 --> 03:07:38.340]   - Yeah.
[03:07:38.340 --> 03:07:39.620]   - It was in his second term
[03:07:39.620 --> 03:07:41.300]   where most of what I'm talking about happened,
[03:07:41.300 --> 03:07:43.020]   so he wasn't facing further election.
[03:07:43.020 --> 03:07:48.020]   But Obama was, what, 46 or 47 when he was inaugurated?
[03:07:48.020 --> 03:07:52.100]   He served for eight years, so he's in his mid-50s.
[03:07:52.100 --> 03:07:54.820]   He's got another half century or 40 years of life,
[03:07:54.820 --> 03:07:55.660]   God willing.
[03:07:55.660 --> 03:07:58.940]   His post-presidency, I think,
[03:07:58.940 --> 03:08:00.620]   was what was primarily on his mind.
[03:08:00.620 --> 03:08:03.100]   Not getting elected to anything,
[03:08:03.100 --> 03:08:05.260]   but being enshrined in a certain way.
[03:08:05.260 --> 03:08:10.260]   And the persona that he is now embodying,
[03:08:10.260 --> 03:08:14.840]   which depends upon a racial narrative
[03:08:14.840 --> 03:08:18.140]   that I and Thomas Sowell and others object to,
[03:08:18.140 --> 03:08:21.320]   I think was very much in the forefront of his mind
[03:08:21.320 --> 03:08:23.700]   when he made decisions as the chief executive officer
[03:08:23.700 --> 03:08:28.700]   of the country that we've all now have to live with.
[03:08:28.700 --> 03:08:34.380]   - Yeah, but the fact is he opened the door
[03:08:34.380 --> 03:08:36.900]   in a way that hasn't been done in the history
[03:08:36.900 --> 03:08:40.700]   of the United States,
[03:08:40.700 --> 03:08:45.700]   that I don't see there being even a significant discussion
[03:08:47.500 --> 03:08:52.060]   when an African-American, a black man or a black woman
[03:08:52.060 --> 03:08:54.920]   runs for president, maybe a black man, let's say,
[03:08:54.920 --> 03:08:56.960]   'cause there still hasn't been a woman president.
[03:08:56.960 --> 03:09:01.000]   I just see that that broke open the possibility of that.
[03:09:01.000 --> 03:09:02.560]   That's not even a discussion.
[03:09:02.560 --> 03:09:05.960]   And that example by itself, I mean, to me,
[03:09:05.960 --> 03:09:08.760]   the role of the president isn't just policy,
[03:09:08.760 --> 03:09:13.760]   it's to inspire, it's to do the Dr. King thing,
[03:09:13.760 --> 03:09:16.780]   which is, I have a dream.
[03:09:16.780 --> 03:09:19.480]   And Barack Obama is an example of somebody
[03:09:19.480 --> 03:09:21.240]   that could give one hell of a speech.
[03:09:21.240 --> 03:09:23.840]   It got you to believe.
[03:09:23.840 --> 03:09:26.880]   - Obama is a smooth operator without any question.
[03:09:26.880 --> 03:09:28.400]   He's a master of his craft.
[03:09:28.400 --> 03:09:30.760]   He did the impossible.
[03:09:30.760 --> 03:09:34.240]   I mean, he beat Hillary Clinton in that primary fight,
[03:09:34.240 --> 03:09:37.960]   and he beat John McCain in that general election,
[03:09:37.960 --> 03:09:39.100]   and hats off to him.
[03:09:39.100 --> 03:09:43.080]   And moreover, he remains a iconic figure
[03:09:43.080 --> 03:09:43.920]   in American culture.
[03:09:43.920 --> 03:09:46.120]   I don't think there's any doubt about that.
[03:09:46.120 --> 03:09:50.080]   Let me just mention, Clarence Thomas is also black.
[03:09:50.080 --> 03:09:56.000]   Clarence Thomas has a story that is vivid and inspiring,
[03:09:56.000 --> 03:09:57.400]   just like Obama's story.
[03:09:57.400 --> 03:10:00.060]   He overcome obstacles, just like Obama did.
[03:10:00.060 --> 03:10:02.620]   I mean, extreme poverty and so forth and so on.
[03:10:02.620 --> 03:10:07.260]   Clarence Thomas has served longer than any other member
[03:10:07.260 --> 03:10:09.420]   of the United States Supreme Court.
[03:10:09.420 --> 03:10:13.160]   He is one of nine justices,
[03:10:13.160 --> 03:10:15.620]   and it's three equal branches of government.
[03:10:15.620 --> 03:10:18.360]   So Clarence Thomas, by my arithmetic,
[03:10:18.360 --> 03:10:22.520]   personifies 1/27 of the American state.
[03:10:22.520 --> 03:10:28.680]   He is an iconic figure.
[03:10:28.680 --> 03:10:31.960]   His example should be an inspiration
[03:10:31.960 --> 03:10:33.860]   to Americans of all races,
[03:10:33.860 --> 03:10:36.380]   but especially of black American youngsters.
[03:10:36.380 --> 03:10:38.880]   He happens to be conservative.
[03:10:38.880 --> 03:10:40.080]   He's very conservative.
[03:10:40.080 --> 03:10:42.460]   So fucking what?
[03:10:43.680 --> 03:10:46.520]   He too deserves to be in that pantheon.
[03:10:46.520 --> 03:10:47.820]   He is not.
[03:10:47.820 --> 03:10:50.800]   By the custodians of American education,
[03:10:50.800 --> 03:10:53.160]   Clarence Thomas's name is not on that many schools.
[03:10:53.160 --> 03:10:55.240]   Barack Obama's name will be on many of them.
[03:10:55.240 --> 03:10:56.520]   I'm not equating them.
[03:10:56.520 --> 03:10:57.440]   They're different people.
[03:10:57.440 --> 03:10:59.520]   The offices are very different.
[03:10:59.520 --> 03:11:01.960]   But the same logic that you just used
[03:11:01.960 --> 03:11:06.960]   to extol the significance of Barack Obama's ascendancy
[03:11:06.960 --> 03:11:10.220]   could and should be applied to Clarence Thomas,
[03:11:10.220 --> 03:11:12.000]   in my opinion.
[03:11:12.000 --> 03:11:15.400]   - Yes, but it's the office,
[03:11:15.400 --> 03:11:20.400]   but also there's a resume and there's accomplishments,
[03:11:20.400 --> 03:11:23.620]   but then there is oratory and charisma
[03:11:23.620 --> 03:11:25.460]   and a number of Twitter followers.
[03:11:25.460 --> 03:11:30.380]   So there's ability to captivate a large number of people.
[03:11:30.380 --> 03:11:33.120]   And that's a skill.
[03:11:33.120 --> 03:11:35.840]   That's a skill that correlates,
[03:11:35.840 --> 03:11:38.760]   but is not directly connected to
[03:11:38.760 --> 03:11:40.840]   with how impressive your resume is.
[03:11:40.840 --> 03:11:41.680]   - I agree.
[03:11:41.680 --> 03:11:43.120]   - However, the judicial function,
[03:11:43.120 --> 03:11:45.400]   the judge doesn't go out and give speeches of that sort
[03:11:45.400 --> 03:11:48.240]   because it's exactly antithetical to what he's doing.
[03:11:48.240 --> 03:11:50.360]   He's a custodian of the law
[03:11:50.360 --> 03:11:54.760]   and that's not a popular figure in American policy.
[03:11:54.760 --> 03:11:57.720]   He doesn't stand for election and it's a good thing too.
[03:11:57.720 --> 03:11:59.720]   So I take that point.
[03:11:59.720 --> 03:12:02.320]   Here, I wanna say something else though that's provocative.
[03:12:02.320 --> 03:12:03.720]   The next black president,
[03:12:03.720 --> 03:12:05.280]   you say the first black president
[03:12:05.280 --> 03:12:06.960]   shouldn't have been the one to do that.
[03:12:06.960 --> 03:12:08.480]   The second one should,
[03:12:08.480 --> 03:12:10.520]   is more likely than not gonna be a Republican.
[03:12:10.520 --> 03:12:12.400]   I don't have a particular person in mind.
[03:12:12.400 --> 03:12:13.240]   I'm just saying.
[03:12:13.240 --> 03:12:14.320]   - I agree.
[03:12:14.320 --> 03:12:15.160]   I agree.
[03:12:15.160 --> 03:12:15.980]   (laughing)
[03:12:15.980 --> 03:12:16.820]   I agree.
[03:12:16.820 --> 03:12:17.660]   (laughing)
[03:12:17.660 --> 03:12:19.560]   And that's why it's gonna be super fun.
[03:12:19.560 --> 03:12:25.400]   Let me ask you to put on your wise sage hat
[03:12:25.400 --> 03:12:27.560]   and give advice to young people.
[03:12:27.560 --> 03:12:28.960]   So if you're talking to somebody
[03:12:28.960 --> 03:12:31.080]   who's in high school and in college,
[03:12:31.080 --> 03:12:34.320]   what advice would you give them about their career,
[03:12:34.320 --> 03:12:37.320]   about life in general,
[03:12:37.320 --> 03:12:39.360]   how to live a life they can be proud of?
[03:12:40.200 --> 03:12:44.160]   - Well, I'd say the world is your oyster.
[03:12:44.160 --> 03:12:46.000]   I mean, first order of business, you're not a victim.
[03:12:46.000 --> 03:12:47.040]   I don't care what color you are.
[03:12:47.040 --> 03:12:48.680]   I don't care you're male, female, you're gay, straight,
[03:12:48.680 --> 03:12:51.240]   whatever, the world is your oyster.
[03:12:51.240 --> 03:12:52.320]   You are so privileged.
[03:12:52.320 --> 03:12:54.040]   You sit here in the United States of America,
[03:12:54.040 --> 03:12:55.320]   a free country, a rich country,
[03:12:55.320 --> 03:12:56.820]   everything is possible for you.
[03:12:56.820 --> 03:12:58.660]   Believe me, you can do anything.
[03:12:58.660 --> 03:13:05.680]   Secondly, I would say mastery over the medium
[03:13:07.040 --> 03:13:11.800]   in which we're embedded is the key to the future.
[03:13:11.800 --> 03:13:15.420]   So get educated, focus, work hard,
[03:13:15.420 --> 03:13:21.160]   invest in your future by acquiring the skills
[03:13:21.160 --> 03:13:23.980]   that you need to be able to navigate the 21st century.
[03:13:23.980 --> 03:13:28.520]   I would say the Chinese are coming
[03:13:28.520 --> 03:13:30.340]   and I don't mean anything against China.
[03:13:30.340 --> 03:13:32.200]   I just mean to say the world's a small place
[03:13:32.200 --> 03:13:34.520]   and it's getting smaller.
[03:13:34.520 --> 03:13:39.520]   And you better get moving and you better get moving quickly.
[03:13:39.520 --> 03:13:47.360]   I'd say your identity, your coloration, your orientation,
[03:13:47.360 --> 03:13:52.360]   your category is not the most important thing about you.
[03:13:52.360 --> 03:14:00.960]   So the temptation to limit yourself,
[03:14:00.960 --> 03:14:03.120]   I give this speech to my kids.
[03:14:03.120 --> 03:14:08.120]   I would say, I quote James Joyce.
[03:14:08.120 --> 03:14:15.760]   He has a passage in "Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man"
[03:14:15.760 --> 03:14:21.180]   in which he says, "Do you know what Ireland is?
[03:14:21.180 --> 03:14:26.960]   Ireland is an old sow that eats her pharaoh."
[03:14:26.960 --> 03:14:28.920]   This is Joyce.
[03:14:28.920 --> 03:14:32.680]   He says, Stephen Dedalus is the character
[03:14:32.680 --> 03:14:35.320]   that he has in mind in this chronicle.
[03:14:35.320 --> 03:14:39.920]   He says, "Your ethnic inheritance,"
[03:14:39.920 --> 03:14:42.020]   he's talking about Irish nationalism,
[03:14:42.020 --> 03:14:46.280]   "are like nets holding you back.
[03:14:46.280 --> 03:14:49.760]   That your challenge is to learn how to turn those nets
[03:14:49.760 --> 03:14:53.520]   into wings and thereby to fly."
[03:14:53.520 --> 03:14:58.200]   Okay, flying into the open skies of modern society.
[03:14:58.200 --> 03:15:02.520]   Don't be your grandfather, don't be your father.
[03:15:02.520 --> 03:15:04.400]   Don't wear your thing so heavily
[03:15:04.400 --> 03:15:06.000]   that it keeps you from being open
[03:15:06.000 --> 03:15:08.700]   to everything that's new in the world.
[03:15:08.700 --> 03:15:10.540]   Wear it lightly.
[03:15:10.540 --> 03:15:12.240]   Yes, everybody comes from somewhere,
[03:15:12.240 --> 03:15:14.400]   but it doesn't have to be where you end up.
[03:15:14.400 --> 03:15:18.540]   So you're not your father, you're not your grandfather.
[03:15:18.540 --> 03:15:24.960]   You are this wonderfully blessed human being
[03:15:24.960 --> 03:15:28.460]   in the middle of, going into the middle of the 21st century.
[03:15:28.460 --> 03:15:32.440]   And don't miss it.
[03:15:32.440 --> 03:15:37.440]   Don't live blinkerly, don't live small, live big.
[03:15:37.440 --> 03:15:46.080]   Live big and wear your history lightly.
[03:15:46.080 --> 03:15:51.320]   Yeah, everybody's got a mother tongue.
[03:15:51.320 --> 03:15:54.400]   Everybody's got a story, everybody has a people.
[03:15:54.400 --> 03:15:56.720]   But the world is a small place.
[03:15:56.720 --> 03:16:01.920]   I love that you're quoting an Irishman.
[03:16:02.440 --> 03:16:03.480]   (laughing)
[03:16:03.480 --> 03:16:05.720]   One of the greatest writers of the 20th century,
[03:16:05.720 --> 03:16:09.520]   a profound one, but an Irishman nevertheless.
[03:16:09.520 --> 03:16:14.480]   The levels of humor within that is not lost on me.
[03:16:14.480 --> 03:16:16.920]   Let me just mention the great Ralph Ellison,
[03:16:16.920 --> 03:16:19.280]   the African-American writer, "Invisible Man"
[03:16:19.280 --> 03:16:23.920]   is his masterpiece, embodied this spirit.
[03:16:23.920 --> 03:16:26.720]   Okay, we black Americans, we do come from somewhere,
[03:16:26.720 --> 03:16:29.760]   that coming from somewhere is from slavery in America.
[03:16:29.760 --> 03:16:32.840]   That's our ancestral heritage.
[03:16:32.840 --> 03:16:35.040]   But that's not what we are.
[03:16:35.040 --> 03:16:40.040]   Skin and bone, these are superficial things, the spirit.
[03:16:40.040 --> 03:16:41.840]   And if I were a more religious person,
[03:16:41.840 --> 03:16:44.160]   I could give a whole disposition about that.
[03:16:44.160 --> 03:16:46.260]   But it's the spirit, it's that light that's inside.
[03:16:46.260 --> 03:16:47.400]   That's who we are.
[03:16:47.400 --> 03:16:50.760]   And our challenge is to live in the fullness of it,
[03:16:50.760 --> 03:16:53.440]   as opposed to this blinkered thing.
[03:16:53.440 --> 03:16:55.200]   When we don't look left, we don't look right.
[03:16:55.200 --> 03:16:58.340]   We're just fitting within this template
[03:16:58.340 --> 03:17:02.760]   that we inherit, that is a travesty, really.
[03:17:02.760 --> 03:17:06.120]   - Glenn, you've lived an incredible life,
[03:17:06.120 --> 03:17:09.080]   a productive one, but just representing
[03:17:09.080 --> 03:17:13.240]   some powerful ideas, some powerful ideals.
[03:17:13.240 --> 03:17:15.900]   But life comes to an end.
[03:17:15.900 --> 03:17:18.440]   - Yeah.
[03:17:18.440 --> 03:17:20.920]   - Do you think about your death?
[03:17:20.920 --> 03:17:21.960]   Are you afraid of it?
[03:17:24.100 --> 03:17:29.100]   - Well, it is a really interesting coincidence
[03:17:29.100 --> 03:17:31.680]   that you posed me that question,
[03:17:31.680 --> 03:17:35.100]   because I'm coming from a funeral.
[03:17:35.100 --> 03:17:40.200]   Today is Sunday.
[03:17:40.200 --> 03:17:43.400]   On the preceding Tuesday, five days ago,
[03:17:43.400 --> 03:17:48.180]   I was at the funeral of Eugene Wesley Smith,
[03:17:48.180 --> 03:17:51.640]   who was my brother-in-law.
[03:17:51.640 --> 03:17:53.620]   He was my sister's husband.
[03:17:54.600 --> 03:17:59.600]   My sister, Leonette, passed away in August of 2021.
[03:17:59.600 --> 03:18:04.760]   Her husband has died at the age of 68
[03:18:04.760 --> 03:18:10.980]   in April of 2022, and I was at his funeral.
[03:18:10.980 --> 03:18:14.140]   He died suddenly of a heart attack
[03:18:14.140 --> 03:18:15.640]   that came completely out of the blue.
[03:18:15.640 --> 03:18:17.340]   He seemed to be in perfect health.
[03:18:17.340 --> 03:18:20.420]   He was a magnificent human being.
[03:18:20.420 --> 03:18:22.580]   I could go into the details, but, you know.
[03:18:23.400 --> 03:18:24.600]   Take my word for it.
[03:18:24.600 --> 03:18:29.140]   He was a businessman, a steel trader, metals trader.
[03:18:29.140 --> 03:18:30.900]   He would buy and sell.
[03:18:30.900 --> 03:18:32.720]   He worked mostly from his home office.
[03:18:32.720 --> 03:18:35.240]   He had clients, counterparties,
[03:18:35.240 --> 03:18:37.580]   people he did business with all over the world.
[03:18:37.580 --> 03:18:44.140]   He had three sons, one of whom is in his early 30s,
[03:18:44.140 --> 03:18:45.800]   two of whom are in their late 30s.
[03:18:45.800 --> 03:18:48.040]   These are my sister's children.
[03:18:48.040 --> 03:18:50.520]   She's deceased, now he's deceased.
[03:18:50.520 --> 03:18:54.540]   The older two sons are severely developmentally disabled,
[03:18:54.540 --> 03:18:57.420]   and although they're in their late 30s,
[03:18:57.420 --> 03:18:59.900]   they're not independently viable.
[03:18:59.900 --> 03:19:02.040]   They don't function effectively.
[03:19:02.040 --> 03:19:03.340]   They have to be cared for.
[03:19:03.340 --> 03:19:08.280]   That responsibility has now fallen to the family,
[03:19:08.280 --> 03:19:10.960]   but mainly to the surviving son,
[03:19:10.960 --> 03:19:14.100]   who lives with his wife and his two young children,
[03:19:14.100 --> 03:19:17.100]   and has assumed the responsibility.
[03:19:17.100 --> 03:19:20.500]   They've cared at home, my sister and her husband, Wesley.
[03:19:20.500 --> 03:19:22.400]   Eugene Wesley Smith,
[03:19:22.400 --> 03:19:25.000]   cared for their disabled sons at home.
[03:19:25.000 --> 03:19:26.720]   They didn't wanna see them institutionalized.
[03:19:26.720 --> 03:19:29.300]   They had some help from programs at the state
[03:19:29.300 --> 03:19:30.460]   and social worker and so on,
[03:19:30.460 --> 03:19:32.440]   but they mainly took on the burden
[03:19:32.440 --> 03:19:34.580]   of caring for them at home.
[03:19:34.580 --> 03:19:36.220]   Anyway, I go on at length here,
[03:19:36.220 --> 03:19:37.720]   and I don't know how much of this
[03:19:37.720 --> 03:19:39.340]   you will choose to make use of,
[03:19:39.340 --> 03:19:41.280]   and it doesn't matter, really.
[03:19:41.280 --> 03:19:43.220]   I'm just trying to respond to your question.
[03:19:43.220 --> 03:19:47.200]   I was asked to offer some remarks at the funeral,
[03:19:49.280 --> 03:19:50.340]   and I offered them.
[03:19:50.340 --> 03:19:56.120]   I spoke well of this great man.
[03:19:56.120 --> 03:19:57.000]   He was a great man.
[03:19:57.000 --> 03:19:59.000]   He had a straight back.
[03:19:59.000 --> 03:20:00.160]   He was a stand-up guy.
[03:20:00.160 --> 03:20:01.640]   He could be counted on.
[03:20:01.640 --> 03:20:02.680]   His word was his bond.
[03:20:02.680 --> 03:20:04.160]   He had broad shoulders.
[03:20:04.160 --> 03:20:06.460]   He carried a lot of people with him,
[03:20:06.460 --> 03:20:08.920]   business associates, family members,
[03:20:08.920 --> 03:20:10.600]   and so forth and so on.
[03:20:10.600 --> 03:20:12.080]   He had a huge heart.
[03:20:12.080 --> 03:20:13.960]   He was a giving and kind person.
[03:20:13.960 --> 03:20:15.200]   He had a great mind.
[03:20:15.200 --> 03:20:16.240]   He was an intellectual,
[03:20:16.240 --> 03:20:18.320]   even though as a businessman,
[03:20:18.320 --> 03:20:23.320]   much of his day was taken up with the minutiae of contracts
[03:20:23.320 --> 03:20:27.520]   and the details of the order being delivered
[03:20:27.520 --> 03:20:28.440]   and not being delivered,
[03:20:28.440 --> 03:20:30.120]   of the quality of the product,
[03:20:30.120 --> 03:20:32.120]   of the financing, and so forth and so on.
[03:20:32.120 --> 03:20:34.140]   - There was still a powerful mind there.
[03:20:34.140 --> 03:20:35.320]   - Yeah, he was a powerful mind,
[03:20:35.320 --> 03:20:37.240]   and he studied, he read books,
[03:20:37.240 --> 03:20:39.040]   he was interested in music and art.
[03:20:39.040 --> 03:20:42.240]   He's a spiritual seeker,
[03:20:42.240 --> 03:20:46.200]   had been ordained as a child minister in his youth,
[03:20:46.200 --> 03:20:51.200]   and while he remained a master of the Christian canon,
[03:20:51.200 --> 03:20:58.400]   he also explored Eastern religion and other spiritual paths
[03:20:58.400 --> 03:21:01.880]   and kind of stood above any particular tradition
[03:21:01.880 --> 03:21:03.720]   as a man who believed in God,
[03:21:03.720 --> 03:21:06.880]   but thought that God manifest himself in many ways
[03:21:06.880 --> 03:21:09.400]   to human beings and that there was much to learn
[03:21:09.400 --> 03:21:12.020]   from other religious traditions as well.
[03:21:12.020 --> 03:21:13.200]   This is Wesley.
[03:21:13.200 --> 03:21:14.640]   We called him Wesley by his middle name,
[03:21:14.640 --> 03:21:17.000]   Eugene Wesley Smith, may he rest in peace.
[03:21:17.000 --> 03:21:20.960]   68, that's five years younger than I am right now.
[03:21:20.960 --> 03:21:23.200]   He dropped dead without any warning.
[03:21:23.200 --> 03:21:24.220]   I could too.
[03:21:24.220 --> 03:21:26.920]   So--
[03:21:26.920 --> 03:21:29.000]   - How did that make you feel?
[03:21:29.000 --> 03:21:31.660]   What were the thoughts in your mind leading up to it,
[03:21:31.660 --> 03:21:34.360]   having to give that speech in the days that followed?
[03:21:34.360 --> 03:21:35.200]   - Well, first of all, I wondered,
[03:21:35.200 --> 03:21:36.640]   what would I say, what would I say?
[03:21:36.640 --> 03:21:38.440]   And there was no way to prepare,
[03:21:38.440 --> 03:21:42.160]   and I decided, I rehearsed in my mind this,
[03:21:42.160 --> 03:21:43.760]   he had a straight back, he had broad shoulders,
[03:21:43.760 --> 03:21:46.040]   he had a big heart, he had a great mind,
[03:21:46.040 --> 03:21:49.480]   he had a capacious spirit and whatnot,
[03:21:49.480 --> 03:21:52.440]   and I used that as a template for making my remarks.
[03:21:52.440 --> 03:21:54.520]   But my main thought was, my God,
[03:21:54.520 --> 03:21:57.460]   life is precious and life is fleeting,
[03:21:57.460 --> 03:21:59.700]   and death is a part of life.
[03:21:59.700 --> 03:22:03.240]   My death is a part of my life.
[03:22:03.240 --> 03:22:07.200]   And I thought, well, I wanna take better care of myself
[03:22:07.200 --> 03:22:09.940]   than I do, et cetera, et cetera.
[03:22:09.940 --> 03:22:13.640]   But I also thought a lot of this is not in my hands at all.
[03:22:13.640 --> 03:22:16.840]   I thought one should have his affairs in order.
[03:22:16.840 --> 03:22:18.880]   My brother did not have all of his affairs in order
[03:22:18.880 --> 03:22:21.520]   in the sense that there is a lot of,
[03:22:21.520 --> 03:22:23.520]   things are going to probate, there was no will,
[03:22:23.520 --> 03:22:25.920]   there's, it's kind of unsettled.
[03:22:25.920 --> 03:22:30.280]   I don't want that to happen to my surviving family members.
[03:22:30.280 --> 03:22:34.440]   I wanna have my affairs such that should heaven forbid,
[03:22:34.440 --> 03:22:37.080]   I fall over one day and don't get up again,
[03:22:37.080 --> 03:22:39.800]   people don't have to scramble about
[03:22:39.800 --> 03:22:43.400]   how to take care of things from that point forward.
[03:22:43.400 --> 03:22:45.360]   - But as a human, are you afraid?
[03:22:45.360 --> 03:22:48.320]   In your own heart? - I'm afraid.
[03:22:48.320 --> 03:22:51.320]   Now, I read this wonderful book called "The Swerve."
[03:22:51.320 --> 03:22:53.800]   It's about Lucretius.
[03:22:53.800 --> 03:22:56.600]   It's about the nature of things,
[03:22:56.600 --> 03:23:00.320]   which is this great classical work from the Roman period
[03:23:00.320 --> 03:23:03.680]   by this guy, Lucretius.
[03:23:03.680 --> 03:23:05.500]   And I'm trying to think of the name of the author,
[03:23:05.500 --> 03:23:06.520]   but you could look it up.
[03:23:06.520 --> 03:23:07.800]   "The Swerve" is the book.
[03:23:07.800 --> 03:23:10.840]   It won a National Book Award or a Pulitzer Prize.
[03:23:10.840 --> 03:23:13.640]   And it's the history of the recovery of this book
[03:23:13.640 --> 03:23:20.760]   by one of these Italian, Renaissance Italian people
[03:23:20.760 --> 03:23:24.440]   who would go into the monasteries in Central Europe
[03:23:24.440 --> 03:23:26.520]   and look through the scrolls,
[03:23:26.520 --> 03:23:29.500]   and they discover these classical works from antiquity,
[03:23:29.500 --> 03:23:31.800]   which had been lost through the Dark Ages,
[03:23:31.800 --> 03:23:36.800]   and they republish and read these works.
[03:23:36.920 --> 03:23:41.040]   And Lucretius's great work on the nature of things
[03:23:41.040 --> 03:23:45.320]   was one of these books, Poggio Bracchelini.
[03:23:45.320 --> 03:23:46.960]   I don't remember the Italian guy's name,
[03:23:46.960 --> 03:23:49.320]   but this all could be looked up.
[03:23:49.320 --> 03:23:52.780]   - Yeah, Poggio Bracchelini, 15th century.
[03:23:52.780 --> 03:23:58.180]   15th century, and the name of the author
[03:23:58.180 --> 03:23:59.880]   is Stephen Greenblatt.
[03:23:59.880 --> 03:24:02.400]   - Yeah, Stephen Greenblatt, a magnificent book
[03:24:02.400 --> 03:24:04.960]   and a terrific story.
[03:24:04.960 --> 03:24:09.880]   Anyway, one of Lucretius's points, he was an atheist.
[03:24:09.880 --> 03:24:11.600]   I mean, he was a Roman.
[03:24:11.600 --> 03:24:15.200]   I mean, he didn't believe in mysticism,
[03:24:15.200 --> 03:24:20.200]   and he argued it's irrational to be afraid of death.
[03:24:20.200 --> 03:24:21.960]   Why should I fear death?
[03:24:21.960 --> 03:24:23.400]   Death is coming to all of us.
[03:24:23.400 --> 03:24:27.080]   The point of being afraid, I mean, I'm wasting my time
[03:24:27.080 --> 03:24:30.160]   fearing something that I have no ultimate control over.
[03:24:30.160 --> 03:24:32.100]   It's irrational to be afraid of death.
[03:24:34.320 --> 03:24:37.320]   - Yeah, because you can't predict when it happens.
[03:24:37.320 --> 03:24:43.120]   You only know that it happens, so why be afraid?
[03:24:43.120 --> 03:24:43.960]   How's that go?
[03:24:43.960 --> 03:24:45.160]   - And therefore live every day fully,
[03:24:45.160 --> 03:24:50.160]   live every day purposefully, and so on.
[03:24:50.160 --> 03:24:52.680]   But these are all just words.
[03:24:52.680 --> 03:24:55.080]   I don't wanna die.
[03:24:55.080 --> 03:24:55.920]   I wanna live forever.
[03:24:55.920 --> 03:24:57.520]   I'm not gonna live forever.
[03:24:57.520 --> 03:24:59.720]   I don't wanna suffer.
[03:24:59.720 --> 03:25:01.080]   I see people suffering.
[03:25:01.080 --> 03:25:04.240]   I saw my late wife, Linda Datcher Lowry,
[03:25:04.240 --> 03:25:06.800]   Dr. Linda Datcher Lowry,
[03:25:06.800 --> 03:25:10.000]   professor of economics at Tufts University,
[03:25:10.000 --> 03:25:12.420]   whom I met in graduate school at MIT,
[03:25:12.420 --> 03:25:14.720]   black woman from Baltimore.
[03:25:14.720 --> 03:25:17.280]   We married, we raised two sons together.
[03:25:17.280 --> 03:25:22.160]   She died at the age of 59 from metastatic breast cancer,
[03:25:22.160 --> 03:25:24.320]   and I watched her suffer, and I watched her die,
[03:25:24.320 --> 03:25:25.480]   and it took a while.
[03:25:25.480 --> 03:25:30.400]   And we cared for her at home right up until the very end.
[03:25:30.400 --> 03:25:35.040]   She died in our bed with our sons on either side of her,
[03:25:35.040 --> 03:25:38.360]   and the dog curled up by the door,
[03:25:38.360 --> 03:25:42.120]   the porch door in the bedroom, and she expired.
[03:25:42.120 --> 03:25:45.600]   And I watched her suffer, and I watched her die,
[03:25:45.600 --> 03:25:46.920]   and I don't wanna suffer.
[03:25:46.920 --> 03:25:48.420]   Who does?
[03:25:48.420 --> 03:25:50.120]   I don't wanna die.
[03:25:50.120 --> 03:25:53.180]   I am likely to suffer before I die.
[03:25:53.180 --> 03:25:58.100]   I am likely to see my death coming and to lament it.
[03:25:58.940 --> 03:26:02.940]   There's a book by Richard John Newhouse,
[03:26:02.940 --> 03:26:07.340]   the theologian, called "As I Lay Dying."
[03:26:07.340 --> 03:26:10.260]   "As I Lay Dying," Richard John Newhouse.
[03:26:10.260 --> 03:26:15.980]   He had stomach cancer, and he thought he was dying,
[03:26:15.980 --> 03:26:18.780]   and he wrote this book, "As He Lay Dying."
[03:26:18.780 --> 03:26:19.900]   And then he recovered.
[03:26:19.900 --> 03:26:24.260]   It went into remission, and he had another couple of years.
[03:26:24.260 --> 03:26:27.300]   He thought he was dying, and he had another couple of years.
[03:26:27.300 --> 03:26:30.860]   And I can remember meeting him at a bookstore
[03:26:30.860 --> 03:26:34.260]   in suburban Boston when he was on a tour.
[03:26:34.260 --> 03:26:35.980]   He was a friend of mine,
[03:26:35.980 --> 03:26:38.760]   a theologian and a public intellectual.
[03:26:38.760 --> 03:26:43.420]   He founded the Institute on Religion and Public Life
[03:26:43.420 --> 03:26:47.820]   in New York City, which still exists, Richard John Newhouse.
[03:26:47.820 --> 03:26:49.380]   And he's contemplating his own death
[03:26:49.380 --> 03:26:51.320]   from the point of view of a Christian minister.
[03:26:51.320 --> 03:26:53.340]   He was first a Lutheran pastor,
[03:26:53.340 --> 03:26:55.860]   and then he converted to Catholicism,
[03:26:55.860 --> 03:26:58.300]   or as he would have put it, "I returned to the church,"
[03:26:58.300 --> 03:27:00.860]   'cause he thought the Renaissance was over.
[03:27:00.860 --> 03:27:03.700]   I mean, I'm sorry, the Reformation, Richard thought,
[03:27:03.700 --> 03:27:04.540]   was over.
[03:27:04.540 --> 03:27:08.020]   He says, "There's only one church," et cetera.
[03:27:08.020 --> 03:27:11.220]   Get into theology stuff here.
[03:27:11.220 --> 03:27:14.220]   But I'm saying all that to say,
[03:27:14.220 --> 03:27:16.580]   I read that book aloud to my wife, Linda,
[03:27:16.580 --> 03:27:18.020]   "As She Lay Dying" in that bed.
[03:27:18.020 --> 03:27:19.620]   I read that book.
[03:27:19.620 --> 03:27:21.860]   And it was filled with hope.
[03:27:21.860 --> 03:27:25.380]   I mean, it first acknowledged the dread.
[03:27:25.380 --> 03:27:27.820]   Yes, I lie dying.
[03:27:27.820 --> 03:27:29.380]   I don't wanna die.
[03:27:29.380 --> 03:27:30.700]   I'm a Christian minister.
[03:27:30.700 --> 03:27:32.500]   Christ was raised from the dead.
[03:27:32.500 --> 03:27:34.160]   I'm supposed to believe in everlasting life,
[03:27:34.160 --> 03:27:35.100]   but the fact of the matter is,
[03:27:35.100 --> 03:27:37.620]   this is me and I'm lying here and I'm dying.
[03:27:37.620 --> 03:27:39.020]   This is the end of me.
[03:27:39.020 --> 03:27:41.460]   How are you gonna do anything
[03:27:41.460 --> 03:27:42.940]   other than dread the end of me?
[03:27:42.940 --> 03:27:45.500]   So let's acknowledge that I don't wanna die, okay?
[03:27:45.500 --> 03:27:47.860]   I'm just gonna tell you that up front.
[03:27:47.860 --> 03:27:52.860]   But that is not the end of,
[03:27:53.060 --> 03:27:55.660]   my death is not the end of life.
[03:27:55.660 --> 03:27:58.140]   I have lived well and fully.
[03:27:58.140 --> 03:28:01.320]   I will go and do my best right up until the end.
[03:28:01.320 --> 03:28:05.520]   I will accept what is inevitable.
[03:28:05.520 --> 03:28:06.980]   And I will hold out this belief.
[03:28:06.980 --> 03:28:09.340]   And he's a Christian minister, so he holds out this belief.
[03:28:09.340 --> 03:28:11.980]   And he knows that the belief is not rational.
[03:28:11.980 --> 03:28:16.820]   It's not a reasoned, deductive, scientific conclusion.
[03:28:16.820 --> 03:28:20.580]   It's spiritual in the most fundamental way.
[03:28:21.440 --> 03:28:25.000]   It is something that people hold onto and they have hope.
[03:28:25.000 --> 03:28:26.000]   And he had hope.
[03:28:26.000 --> 03:28:29.320]   I don't know if I have that hope.
[03:28:29.320 --> 03:28:34.320]   I used to be, but I'm no longer a Christian
[03:28:34.320 --> 03:28:39.560]   and I'm no longer a theist, really.
[03:28:39.560 --> 03:28:42.520]   I'm with Lucretius there.
[03:28:42.520 --> 03:28:46.600]   I mean, there's no magic that's going on here.
[03:28:46.600 --> 03:28:49.440]   There's no unseen hand behind the scene
[03:28:49.440 --> 03:28:51.140]   that's arranging things.
[03:28:51.140 --> 03:28:54.040]   What I believe is that when I look at the natural world,
[03:28:54.040 --> 03:28:56.560]   I see the evolution of the species.
[03:28:56.560 --> 03:28:59.800]   I see the organic development of the planets.
[03:28:59.800 --> 03:29:02.520]   I mean, the Earth is going to not exist
[03:29:02.520 --> 03:29:04.500]   in a finite number of years.
[03:29:04.500 --> 03:29:06.320]   I think with a very high probability,
[03:29:06.320 --> 03:29:08.520]   the sun is gonna die.
[03:29:08.520 --> 03:29:10.560]   It's gonna implode.
[03:29:10.560 --> 03:29:13.240]   It's gonna go supernova, whatever is gonna happen.
[03:29:13.240 --> 03:29:16.820]   And there's not gonna be any there there.
[03:29:16.820 --> 03:29:19.760]   - What's the meaning of life, Glenn Loury?
[03:29:19.760 --> 03:29:21.220]   What's the meaning of life?
[03:29:21.220 --> 03:29:24.020]   - Yeah, let's go, let's go.
[03:29:24.020 --> 03:29:25.120]   What's the why?
[03:29:25.120 --> 03:29:30.060]   Or is that something economists and social scientists
[03:29:30.060 --> 03:29:32.360]   and mathematicians are not equipped to answer?
[03:29:32.360 --> 03:29:34.380]   Shirley.
[03:29:34.380 --> 03:29:37.300]   - You know, I think we try to live well
[03:29:37.300 --> 03:29:39.660]   and meaningfully within our time.
[03:29:39.660 --> 03:29:43.180]   We bond, we reproduce, we try to pass on,
[03:29:43.180 --> 03:29:48.180]   and we accept our limitations and our mortality.
[03:29:48.260 --> 03:29:50.640]   We try to contribute.
[03:29:50.640 --> 03:29:57.820]   And that's through our children and through our work.
[03:29:57.820 --> 03:30:02.060]   And we're in this together.
[03:30:02.060 --> 03:30:03.640]   We're not in this alone.
[03:30:03.640 --> 03:30:06.480]   We are connected to other people.
[03:30:06.480 --> 03:30:11.120]   I get a lot of gratitude out of teaching.
[03:30:11.120 --> 03:30:12.040]   I'm a teacher.
[03:30:12.040 --> 03:30:16.080]   My students are gonna outlive me.
[03:30:16.080 --> 03:30:17.580]   They're gonna have students.
[03:30:18.340 --> 03:30:19.720]   I'm a writer.
[03:30:19.720 --> 03:30:20.900]   My writing is gonna outlive me.
[03:30:20.900 --> 03:30:25.140]   I don't wanna be self-important or pretentious here.
[03:30:25.140 --> 03:30:27.220]   I doubt that I'm gonna be the James Joyce
[03:30:27.220 --> 03:30:29.100]   of the 21st century.
[03:30:29.100 --> 03:30:31.460]   They may not be reading my stuff in 100 years,
[03:30:31.460 --> 03:30:36.460]   as people will certainly be reading Ulysses in 100 years.
[03:30:36.460 --> 03:30:43.020]   But I try to have an impact on the world that I'm a part of
[03:30:43.020 --> 03:30:46.100]   and try to leave a legacy that's dignified.
[03:30:47.100 --> 03:30:49.220]   I could give some flowery words here,
[03:30:49.220 --> 03:30:51.120]   truth-seeking and whatnot.
[03:30:51.120 --> 03:30:52.220]   - What about love?
[03:30:52.220 --> 03:30:53.060]   - Love.
[03:30:53.060 --> 03:30:59.100]   - What role does love play in this life thing?
[03:30:59.100 --> 03:31:01.300]   - Love makes the world go round.
[03:31:01.300 --> 03:31:03.420]   Without love, what have we got?
[03:31:03.420 --> 03:31:08.380]   We don't have family.
[03:31:13.180 --> 03:31:15.220]   We certainly have missed out
[03:31:15.220 --> 03:31:18.420]   if love is not a central part of our existence.
[03:31:18.420 --> 03:31:20.380]   But stop asking me questions like that.
[03:31:20.380 --> 03:31:24.260]   - Thank you for doing everything you do,
[03:31:24.260 --> 03:31:25.380]   for thinking the way you do,
[03:31:25.380 --> 03:31:30.380]   for being fearless and bold in the Glenn Show
[03:31:30.380 --> 03:31:33.340]   and your writing and your work and just being who you are.
[03:31:33.340 --> 03:31:34.980]   Thank you for being you
[03:31:34.980 --> 03:31:37.100]   and thank you for giving me the huge honor
[03:31:37.100 --> 03:31:39.820]   of spending your extremely valuable time with me today.
[03:31:39.820 --> 03:31:40.860]   This was awesome.
[03:31:40.860 --> 03:31:42.740]   - It's been my pleasure, Lex, I mean, really.
[03:31:42.740 --> 03:31:44.860]   And it has been like four hours, man.
[03:31:44.860 --> 03:31:46.340]   I mean, you're wearing me out.
[03:31:46.340 --> 03:31:47.780]   - Love it for me.
[03:31:47.780 --> 03:31:49.300]   I love it.
[03:31:49.300 --> 03:31:50.820]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[03:31:50.820 --> 03:31:52.020]   with Glenn Lowry.

[03:31:55.820 --> 03:31:57.860]   And now let me leave you with some words
[03:31:57.860 --> 03:32:00.420]   from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
[03:32:00.420 --> 03:32:02.740]   If you can't fly, then run.
[03:32:02.740 --> 03:32:05.180]   If you can't run, then walk.
[03:32:05.180 --> 03:32:07.620]   If you can't walk, then crawl.
[03:32:07.620 --> 03:32:11.460]   But whatever you do, you have to keep moving forward.
[03:32:12.500 --> 03:32:15.340]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
[03:32:15.340 --> 03:32:17.940]   (upbeat music)
[03:32:17.940 --> 03:32:20.540]   (upbeat music)
[03:32:20.540 --> 03:32:30.540]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
