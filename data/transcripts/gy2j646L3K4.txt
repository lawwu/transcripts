[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720]   we're not limited in the programs we can run apart from by speed and memory capacity.
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:15.120]   So all limitations, hardware limitations on us, boil down to speed and memory capacity.
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:22.480]   And both those can be augmented to the level of any other entity that is in the universe.
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.600]   Because, you know, if somebody builds a computer that can think faster than the brain,
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.840]   then we can use that very computer, or that very technology,
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.360]   to make our thinking go just as fast as that.
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:42.720]   As far as explanations go, can we reach the same kind of explanations as any other entity?
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:48.800]   Let's say, usually this is said in terms of extraterrestrial intelligences,
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.560]   but also it's said about AGIs, you know, what if they are to us as we are to ants?
[00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.680]   Again, part of that is just hardware, which is easily fixable by adding more hardware.
