[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.180]   What's one of the best ways to be happy?
[00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.480]   To just appreciate what you have, to notice and appreciate the blessings out there.
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.560]   But we've got to push against this natural negativity bias to do this.
[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:12.560]   So how do we do that?
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.120]   Well, it turns out that this is a spot where harnessing attention in the way we were just
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.360]   talking about can be really helpful.
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.600]   Just taking time to notice the blessings, notice kind of all the good stuff.
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.300]   It's often talked about in terms of a gratitude practice, although gratitude sounds kind of
[00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.300]   cheesy.
[00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.400]   I don't know.
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.840]   My friend, Catherine Price, who I mentioned earlier, she has this practice that she calls
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:32.840]   a delight practice.
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.420]   We just notice delights in the world.
[00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.420]   I love the word delight.
[00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.240]   You know, I walked in your studio, you had a picture of your bulldog, and I was like,
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.240]   that's a delight.
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.240]   That's so cute.
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.240]   Thank you for delighting him.
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.960]   I delight in him too, even though he's dead several years now.
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.080]   Delight is a wonderful word.
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.080]   Yeah.
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.540]   And we can train our brain to notice them, right?
[00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.160]   You can literally have a practice where, you know, put in your notes app on your phone,
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.840]   like a list of delights, or even better, pick a friend like I have with Catherine where
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.480]   you can just, like, text them delight.
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.560]   You know, at the end of this, I'll, you know, text like, saw a really cute dog, delight,
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.480]   or heard this really funny song, delight.
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.400]   Then you get the social connection and the gratitude.
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.600]   But what that does is, if you have this practice where you got to write down the delights,
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.000]   your brain starts to automatically be on the lookout for them.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.880]   It becomes rewarding because you get to write this thing down.
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.800]   Now all of a sudden, it can be a practice that you're sort of shifting your negativity
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.180]   bias to notice more of the good things that are out there.
[00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.140]   And there's so much evidence suggesting that people who naturally notice the blessings
[00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.340]   in the world are happier.
[00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.960]   If you do one of these kind of gratitude or delight practices, you wind up happier.
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.540]   Sonia Lubomirsky has this lovely study where you scribble down three to five things you're
[00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.560]   grateful for, three to five delights, in as little as two weeks, you significantly improve
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.400]   your overall satisfaction with life, right?
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.400]   It's super free.
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.400]   I love that.
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.760]   So much so that, and because I accidentally interrupted, the comments always tell me I
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.760]   interrupt too much.
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:47.760]   It's out of interest.
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.760]   It's out of interest.
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:49.760]   I promise.
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:50.760]   If I could interrupt myself, I would.
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.120]   And I probably do from time to time.
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.320]   Could you repeat what the, it's three to five things?
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.320]   Yeah.
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.320]   Three to five things you're grateful for.
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.960]   I'm not sure if the number really matters, but it's committing to kind of noticing the
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.120]   good things in life and really trying to take a moment to notice how they felt, right?
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.940]   You know, so if I look at, I do delight practices sometimes or gratitude practices and it's
[00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.840]   things like my husband, you know, these big things in life.
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.000]   But then sometimes it's like my morning coffee or like probably, you know, seeing your cute
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   dog.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.840]   Like, it's funny to see the picture of the, for folks that don't know Andrew's studio,
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.040]   it's a picture of his dog on a microphone.
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.040]   It's just very funny.
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.040]   It's a giant microphone.
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.040]   Giant, high quality photo.
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.040]   Yeah.
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.080]   And he's standing on the table that I do my solo podcast from at the microphone.
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.660]   And his tag just happened to rotate a few degrees toward the camera just at that moment.
[00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.920]   So you could see his name, Costello, you know?
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.240]   And I invite listeners to pause right now and notice what's happening to their face
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.640]   as you hear Andrew say that.
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.720]   Probably you're just smiling, right?
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.980]   You didn't even see this really cute photo, but you're also smiling.
[00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.580]   That's the power of delights, right?
[00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.000]   Not just noticing them yourself, but potentially sharing them too.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.200]   And so this is another thought pattern practice that we can engage in, which is like, just
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.080]   train your brain to find these things.
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.240]   And what you'll find is that, you know, there's a limited ratio of the stuff we can focus
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.400]   our attention on.
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.640]   If we start shifting towards the delights from the hassles and the yucky stuff in life,
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.440]   now we're just kind of filling our brain with stuff that gives us a little more positive
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.560]   emotion.
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.400]   What I love about this conversation about gratitude is that, I must say, I do like the
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.080]   word delight more than gratitude.
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.080]   Gratitude sounds cheesy.
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.720]   It sounds a little hippy dippy, I gotta say, yeah.
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.100]   Well, I'm from Northern California, so I'm cool with hippy dippy, even though I'm not
[00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.100]   a hippy.
[00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.840]   Punk rocker, not a hippy.
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.320]   You're Berkeley roots, sir.
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.320]   Yeah.
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.320]   I'm from the other end of the peninsula.
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.880]   I love the East Bay, but anyway, this is getting...
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.720]   But the point is, it's not that the word feels soft.
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.820]   I need to think about this a little bit more.
[00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:47.200]   It's that maybe it's just that delight is such a powerful, unselfish word.
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.680]   Like it's not taking anything from anybody.
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.880]   It's not requiring a shift away from one's sort of intrinsic self.
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.280]   I feel like gratitude requires this like, "Okay, I'm gonna now be grateful."
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.880]   It's like kind of like pulling...
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.960]   If you're not already in a state of gratitude, I feel like there's more effort involved.
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.160]   And we've been saying effort that precedes reward is good.
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:14.320]   But with delight, it feels like it's just very much in concert with almost like who
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.320]   one is.
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.320]   Yeah.
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.240]   And like I delight in Costello.
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.480]   I don't expect everyone to delight in Costello.
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.840]   People who did, I delighted in their delight.
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.680]   So it was just amplifying all the delight.
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:31.160]   But the thing that really strikes me about delight is that every example you gave, it's
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.640]   very rapid timescale.
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.120]   I will say I normally drink yerba mate during these things, which I delight in.
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.800]   But today I decided I haven't had coffee in a while, took a little break from it for no
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.200]   particular reason.
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.720]   And I had a single shot of espresso and I was thinking to myself, "This is really good."
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:49.720]   This is delightful.
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:50.720]   Yeah.
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:51.720]   So this is a fast timescale.
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.440]   Maybe it was the fact that I haven't had it in a little while.
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.360]   And it's just really fast.
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.140]   No one suffers.
[00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:59.140]   It's all gain.
[00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:00.140]   Yeah.
[00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.400]   And so it runs a little bit counter-current to what we were talking about before, which
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.880]   is the requirement for effort to precede the reward.
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:15.000]   Delight feels like a very smooth road to a reward that's all net positive.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.160]   And as you said, these delights are available throughout the day.
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.160]   And it doesn't...
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.760]   It requires just noticing something inside and outside.
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.760]   Whereas I feel like with gratitude, I love gratitude practices.
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:27.760]   The data are incredible.
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:28.760]   Yeah.
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:29.760]   It is anything but squishy.
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.880]   It is like a real power tool for shifting one's state of mind.
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.460]   That's clear from the literature.
[00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.520]   But the gratitude thing, I feel like requires an almost like a formalization, like, "Okay,
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.880]   I'm going to be grateful now."
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.320]   Whereas delight, you're just kind of on the lookout for things that spark you and make
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.800]   you reflexively smile.
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:47.800]   Yeah.
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:48.800]   And I think it's...
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:49.800]   And the few things are better than that.
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:50.800]   Yeah.
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.800]   And I think it's really sensory, you know, in the way we were talking about before, right?
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.420]   It gets you back into being present.
[00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:59.600]   Most of these delights are something you taste or you experience or you see that's funny.
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.480]   There's a really lovely book by the author Ross Gay called "The Book of Delights."
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.960]   And he used a delight practice where every day, he not only had to find a delight, but
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.720]   write a short essay about it because he's an author.
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.160]   And it's just hilarious.
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.480]   It's like one of my favorite books.
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.480]   And you just kind of go with...
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:14.960]   And it's really strange things.
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.400]   It's like, one is he, you know, noticed the flower as he noticed his lilacs.
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.960]   And he has this whole idea of...
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.360]   One delight is purple flowers.
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.600]   Why are there so many purple flowers?
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.360]   There's purple flowers everywhere.
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.640]   He also has a delight in music.
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:29.200]   He really likes the '80s band El DeBarge, you know, from the "Beat of the Rhythm" and
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.200]   all that.
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.200]   Yeah.
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.200]   Am I vaguely familiar with it?
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.200]   So it's like...
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.680]   So you have this connection with other people's delights.
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:36.680]   And it's silly.
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.320]   They're just silly things.
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.840]   But the fact that we've noticed them...
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.360]   I mean, again, as a listener is probably experiencing right now, if you pay attention, a little
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.800]   bit of positive emotion, right?
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.000]   If you're driving around your car, feeling a little stressed out in traffic, you can
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.040]   kind of take a breath.
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.680]   And so that's the power of the practice.
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.480]   You're shifting your emotions because you're noticing these good things.
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:58.400]   You're noticing the good things, which is great because you're sort of training your
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.680]   attention to get there, and you're sort of forming this habit to shift that negativity
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.560]   bias that's sort of built in, but isn't really making you as happy as you could be.
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:07.560]   Yeah.
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:08.560]   Yeah.
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:08.560]   Yeah.
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:09.060]   Yeah.
[00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:09.560]   Yeah.
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:10.060]   Yeah.
[00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:13.420]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:15.480]   you
