[00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:36.300]   Radical Personal Finance, Episode 22.
[00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:44.620]   On today's show, an introduction to the very first steps you need to take to start making financial progress.
[00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:51.080]   Today's show, build a statement of financial condition, a.k.a. a personal balance sheet.
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:01:13.060]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast for today, Thursday, July 17, 2014.
[00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:21.040]   This is the show where we try to give you some steps that you can take to connect those big goals, big dreams,
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:27.960]   and big visions that you have for your life to where you are today and give you some practical, actionable tools
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.480]   to help you achieve your goals faster and with greater ease.
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:44.120]   So I'm thrilled that you're with us here today for today's show.
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.360]   And when I sat down this morning and was working on my outline for what I wanted to talk about,
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.000]   what I really wanted to talk about today was paying.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.160]   I was thinking about paying off debt and the order that one should pay off debt and kind of continue some of my commentary
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.280]   from the previous, from a show, I think it was earlier this week.
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.320]   And as one of those topics that in the financial world, I see a lot of information that's good,
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.720]   but it's just looking at one side of it.
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.560]   So I prepared this long outline of how I would think about paying off debt and how to integrate all the different tools.
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.980]   And I realized that I can't go there without starting with the first step.
[00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.980]   I can't go to how to pay off the debt without going through some.
[00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:28.300]   I can't go through some of the information on making, how to write down what you owe and all the different aspects of the debts.
[00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.280]   And this could be very simple for some people or it could be very complicated for other people.
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.000]   But then I realized, well, I can't start there until we go into financial statements.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.040]   And so at the risk of going too deep on things and having these shows be too long and too overwhelming,
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.200]   I've decided today to start with an introduction to personal financial statements.
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.880]   And if that makes your eyes glaze over, please stay with me.
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.960]   I've got a lot of time.
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.180]   I promise I will make this fun and I'll make this interesting and I'll make this really actionable.
[00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.880]   But if you don't have personal financial statements, you're flying blind.
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.700]   The first thing that if I were a financial planner working with you,
[00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.860]   the very first step that I would do after talking to you about what you're trying to do and what your goals are
[00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.680]   is I would start making financial statements.
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.600]   Because the financial statements give us the information that we need to go on.
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.840]   Now, if you'll make these for yourself, and I'll talk you through how to do them in a professional way
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.600]   so that you get all the information that you need.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.860]   But if you'll make these for yourself, you'll be able to do them in a professional way.
[00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:26.360]   If you'll make these for yourself, then you will really be on track to be able to guide yourself
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.360]   and coach yourself through whatever the situation is that you see, that you're in.
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.120]   And what you'll see is that the information that you have written down on paper
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.120]   will help you to be able to make progress.
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.900]   Now, very few people actually keep personal financial statements.
[00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.080]   But yet I'm convinced it's one of the most valuable things that can be done
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.680]   is simply to do this.
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.940]   It won't cost you a dime.
[00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:50.760]   You don't have to buy a car.
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:51.300]   You don't have to buy a product.
[00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.100]   A pen and a paper is all you need.
[00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.440]   And I'll teach you how to do that today with the basics.
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.140]   And I hope to inspire you as to how useful these things are
[00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.160]   so that you can actually have something to work from.
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.140]   So that's what we're going to be doing today.
[00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.960]   I don't have an interview for you.
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.300]   The interview that I had scheduled for today is pushed off to this weekend.
[00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.920]   So hopefully I'll be bringing that to you next week.
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:12.760]   And I've reached out.
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.400]   I've got a long list of people I want to interview.
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.660]   And I'm reaching out to them little by little.
[00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.660]   Tomorrow's show is going to be a Q&A show.
[00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.700]   I'm trying to get some technology.
[00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.400]   I'm trying to get some technology set up so you'll be able to call in questions.
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.080]   There's some great technology for that,
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.200]   to be able to call in questions right from your cell phone,
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.540]   because I assume that's how many of you are listening to me.
[00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.780]   So I'll have that set up as soon as possible,
[00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.280]   but it won't be ready for tomorrow's show.
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.540]   I've got a couple of questions to answer for tomorrow,
[00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.380]   but I still have room for a couple more.
[00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.840]   So if you've got something you'd like me to talk about on tomorrow's Q&A show,
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:40.660]   let me know.
[00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.100]   And then hopefully by next week I will have the technology set up
[00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.280]   so you can call in a question on a voicemail line.
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.760]   And I think that would be really fun
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.380]   so I can start to hear your voice
[00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:50.680]   and start to be able to answer your questions.
[00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.080]   I'd be able to do more than just read text.
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.580]   So let's jump in.
[00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.420]   In a previous show, I said one of the most valuable concepts
[00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.920]   that I would encourage you to think about
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.660]   is how to run your life like a business.
[00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.700]   And I don't mean by that.
[00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.700]   I do not mean that you've got to try to figure out
[00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.140]   how to maximize the economic potential of every single decision.
[00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.940]   A, that's a false concept about business.
[00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.720]   The goal of business is not necessarily to maximize returns,
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.600]   although that's a very important aspect.
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:25.140]   But that's not what I'm talking about in this sense.
[00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:29.060]   What I mean by today, what I mean by that phrase
[00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.340]   of run your life like a business
[00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.760]   is gather some objectivity and pretend you're running a business
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.080]   that will help you to be a little bit disassociated
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.600]   with the actual emotion of your life and where you are.
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.000]   It will help you to make better decisions.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.200]   Now, as humans, we have this incredible challenge
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.260]   of being very emotional creatures.
[00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.540]   We make most of our decisions emotionally.
[00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:52.740]   And then we justify them logically.
[00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.240]   So when we're trying to figure out how to adjust behavior
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.000]   and how to modify our behavior,
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.580]   we need to really understand the emotional triggers that set us off
[00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.920]   and then put a plan in place to use those emotions in a positive way.
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:08.300]   So if you study the science of goal setting or success achievement,
[00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.440]   you'll see that one of the very important areas
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.480]   is not walking away from emotions,
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.460]   but rather learning how to target emotions
[00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.160]   and how to use positive emotions
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.400]   and enhance the emotional appeal
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.880]   of doing the things that are going to lead us towards our goals
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.180]   and then how to increase the emotional pain
[00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.880]   of doing the things that are going to take us away from our goals.
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.220]   Well, we can do exactly the same thing with finance.
[00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.000]   So we've got to manage that emotion,
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.160]   but we've also got to be able to think logically.
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.420]   It's challenging for most of us to be able to think logically
[00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.420]   when we're wrapped up in this emotional world that we live in.
[00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:43.860]   So let's assume that you are deeply in debt.
[00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.620]   I had a client I was working with in the recent past.
[00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.380]   And this client was just deeply in debt,
[00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:50.180]   was falling behind on their business,
[00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:50.800]   was falling behind on their bills,
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.820]   and was really feeling frustrated with what they were going to do.
[00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:56.200]   And I was sitting working with them over a period of time.
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:00.660]   And because I was not emotionally engaged in the situation,
[00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.420]   I don't have any creditors collecting me.
[00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:04.960]   I don't have to deal with the pain and the fear and the stigma,
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:13.360]   the social construct or the social stigma
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.060]   of being behind on my bills.
[00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.500]   It doesn't bother me. It's not mine.
[00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.660]   So I was able to sit down and help him chart out a plan
[00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:19.960]   and write down the goals.
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:20.740]   I was able to write down some numbers,
[00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:22.420]   figure out where they're at, what they're spending,
[00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:24.280]   what their income, and chart out a plan.
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:27.720]   And because I'm not emotionally engaged in the situation,
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.280]   it's very, very simple and straightforward
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.240]   for me to talk through some of the different steps
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.200]   that they could take.
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.020]   And we sat down over the course of a period of meetings
[00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:38.960]   and we created really an amazing plan
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:41.740]   that I could just see the hope
[00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:45.060]   and the joy and the excitement fire off in his eyes.
[00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:46.420]   And it made a dramatic difference.
[00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:47.460]   And I love doing that.
[00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:49.940]   But that's easy for me to do because I'm not emotionally involved.
[00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:52.660]   But when I come to my own life, that's another thing.
[00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:55.780]   So in my own life, I've got to deal with my fear.
[00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:57.080]   I've got to deal with my hang-ups.
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:57.940]   I've got to deal with my insecurities.
[00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:59.940]   I've got to deal with my frustrations,
[00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:02.980]   with my tiredness, with my excitement,
[00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:07.020]   with my depression, with whatever the situation is.
[00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:08.340]   And so it's much more difficult.
[00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:09.560]   So how can we solve it?
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.100]   Well, you could hire somebody.
[00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:12.660]   You could hire an outside person.
[00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:15.940]   You could use and work with a trusted friend who could be that.
[00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:17.060]   Or you could do it for yourself
[00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:18.480]   and you can coach yourself through
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.720]   if you can get an objective.
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.480]   You can get an objective perspective on where you are.
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:26.540]   So an objective perspective with finance is run or helps.
[00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:28.560]   The mental model that I like to use
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.320]   to help gain an objective perspective with finance
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:32.960]   is to view your life like a business.
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:36.720]   So let's assume that you're going to come in
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.760]   and you're going to help me with my business
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:40.560]   or you're going to come in and take over a business.
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:43.020]   Assume that you've decided I'm going to make up on,
[00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:46.260]   you know, I'm running a dry cleaning store.
[00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:47.740]   Okay, so now I've got a business.
[00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:48.920]   I've got a dry cleaning store.
[00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:52.220]   And you've decided that this is a good investment for you.
[00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:54.780]   You have some money and you are going to come in
[00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:55.960]   and you are going to decide
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:57.760]   that you're going to take over my dry cleaning store.
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:58.900]   And it's struggling a little bit,
[00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:00.580]   but you're able to get a good deal on it.
[00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:02.320]   So you come in and you're going to take it over.
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.500]   Well, where would you start?
[00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:06.680]   Where would you start?
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:10.660]   Well, if I were going to go and take over a business,
[00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:12.300]   what I would do is I would start by figuring
[00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:13.680]   what is the purpose of the business?
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.320]   And I probably jumped the gun a little bit
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.700]   by saying it's a dry cleaning store.
[00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:18.380]   But with anything,
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:20.160]   if I'm running a business,
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.500]   and let me ditch that metaphor of the dry cleaning store
[00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:24.680]   because it probably wasn't as good.
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:25.880]   I'm going to take over a business.
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.220]   First thing you're going to do is you're going to come in
[00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:28.580]   and say, why does this business exist?
[00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:30.980]   Why are we here and what are we doing?
[00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:34.440]   If it's business, who are we trying to serve?
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.420]   Who are our customers?
[00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:37.240]   And what do we have to serve them with?
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.580]   And so this is the same thing in financial planning.
[00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:40.940]   I recorded a show in the past,
[00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:42.080]   one of those first 10 episodes.
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:42.980]   I said, what do you want?
[00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:45.080]   What do you want?
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.840]   That's going to be different for every person.
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:48.900]   You've got to decide,
[00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:50.020]   what do you want out of life?
[00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:52.440]   And not to sound all guru-ish,
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.480]   but seriously, what do you want out of life?
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.540]   Do you want money?
[00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:00.760]   Or do you want what money can buy you?
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:03.260]   So some people think they want money
[00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.600]   and what they actually want is what money can buy them.
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.620]   Well, if we could figure out what money can buy you,
[00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:09.200]   is it freedom?
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.900]   Is it prestige?
[00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:12.800]   Is it admiration?
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.880]   I was reading an article yesterday about Bernie Madoff.
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:17.320]   I'm fascinated with Bernie Madoff,
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:18.660]   who was the, if you're not,
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:19.500]   you should be familiar,
[00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:22.760]   but he was the guy who swindled people out of billions of dollars,
[00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:24.080]   ran the massive Ponzi scheme.
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:26.160]   And I was reading a little bit about his,
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.820]   this was in Daniel, what's his name?
[00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:32.340]   The guy who runs the corporation,
[00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:33.680]   the company called Inkblot.
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:35.060]   He's a behavioral psychologist
[00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:39.620]   and involved a lot in behavioral investment.
[00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:41.340]   I was reading his book called You're Not That Great.
[00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:42.560]   I think that's what it's called.
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:43.840]   You're not, something like You're Not That Great.
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.700]   And he was talking about Bernie Madoff in this book.
[00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:48.820]   And in talking about Bernie Madoff,
[00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:52.040]   he was recounting some of Bernie's stories
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:53.460]   and that Bernie Madoff was,
[00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:55.400]   really seemed like he was looking for prestige,
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:57.500]   is that he was looked down upon,
[00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:59.320]   or he felt he was looked down upon
[00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:01.720]   as just the Jewish guy from Brooklyn
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.140]   and nobody really had prestige.
[00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:06.960]   And so what he really gained by running his fund
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:07.760]   in the way that he did
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:10.060]   was he had all the great financiers of Wall Street
[00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:11.980]   coming to him to find out what his secrets were,
[00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:13.820]   how he could create such amazing returns,
[00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:15.280]   basically bowing down to him.
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:17.720]   And so it wasn't so much about the billions.
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:18.600]   It was about the prestige.
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:18.880]   It was about the prestige.
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.860]   So with your life, what do you want?
[00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:22.360]   Is the money a tool to freedom
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.620]   or is the money a tool to prestige?
[00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:26.780]   And you'll see people take different actions.
[00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:28.660]   So on one hand, you may have someone
[00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:31.620]   who is very focused on money as a path to freedom.
[00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:33.740]   And so for them, money is a path to freedom.
[00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:35.660]   They're looking at how efficiently can I get there
[00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:37.100]   to do what I want to do with my time.
[00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:39.740]   And so they may choose to drive a less expensive car.
[00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:41.180]   They may choose to be very frugal.
[00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:45.460]   They may choose to not spend a lot of money
[00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:47.840]   on things that are status symbols
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:48.580]   because they don't have the money to do that.
[00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:50.580]   Because to them, they just want control over their time.
[00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:52.140]   The best example of this that I would use
[00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:53.440]   as the man I'm going to interview next week
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.640]   is going to be Jacob with Early Retirement Extreme.
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:58.260]   It's clear to me, I've never spoken with him,
[00:11:58.260 --> 00:11:59.420]   but just from reading his writing,
[00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:01.520]   it's very clear to me that what he values
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:04.060]   more than anything else is autonomy, self-direction,
[00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:06.540]   and freedom to do what he wants with his life
[00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:07.180]   and with his time.
[00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:09.600]   Now on the other hand, you can see a lot of people
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.420]   who are very interested in status
[00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:13.900]   and they are looking for societal symbols,
[00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.180]   societal status symbols.
[00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:17.060]   So this is where people will maybe,
[00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:18.560]   you'll see them try to explain to you
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:21.360]   and express that in certain outward status symbols.
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:24.060]   For some people in certain cultures,
[00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:26.940]   maybe it's a fancy pair of sneakers
[00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:28.200]   or what are they?
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.700]   I don't know, tennis shoes, whatever they're called.
[00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:32.340]   I got the latest fancy pair of Air Jordans
[00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:33.620]   and this is my status symbol.
[00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:37.000]   In other cultures, it's wearing the latest fashion
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.460]   from Gucci or Armani.
[00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:40.560]   For one guy, it's wearing a suit all the time
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:44.420]   and for another guy, it's wearing a XXXL T-shirt
[00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:46.700]   with baggy shorts falling off his bum.
[00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:48.540]   You know, these are different
[00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:49.240]   status symbols.
[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:50.760]   And so people are trying to express themselves
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:51.240]   with status.
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:52.680]   People do this with cars.
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:54.920]   People do this with the individualization
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:55.540]   of their cars.
[00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:57.960]   So in one culture, it may be with having
[00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.000]   the latest, greatest BMW.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.800]   In another culture, it may be having
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:02.200]   the latest, greatest, fastest car.
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.900]   And then in a third culture, it's having
[00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:06.260]   the biggest rims or the fanciest paint job.
[00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:07.680]   And then in the fourth culture,
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:09.420]   maybe the frugality culture,
[00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:10.600]   it's having the biggest beater,
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:11.700]   the biggest junkie car.
[00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:14.980]   So everyone's kind of, with some people,
[00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:16.120]   they're trying to express status.
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:17.360]   This may be in the home you live in,
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:18.520]   the type of job that you have.
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:21.060]   Many people are not going to,
[00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:22.880]   they're looking at, they look at their job
[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:24.180]   and their work as a status symbol.
[00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:26.080]   So they'll do work that allows them
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:27.720]   to portray themselves as successful.
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:30.160]   You know, I had one of the jobs
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:31.220]   that I had right out of college.
[00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:33.160]   I had one of these successful jobs.
[00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.020]   I was a corporate marketing consultant
[00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:36.360]   and I could make it sound really fun.
[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:37.840]   Well, I could see people's eyes go off
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:40.620]   if I described what I did.
[00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:42.200]   But if I were to describe myself
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:43.900]   as a life insurance salesman,
[00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:45.360]   a life insurance salesman,
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:47.440]   this is something that is not
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:48.500]   the most status,
[00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:50.260]   high status symbol.
[00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.520]   However, it's a far more lucrative business
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:53.740]   if you're good at it than the other.
[00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:55.620]   So you look at this
[00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:57.060]   and the memory that I have
[00:13:57.060 --> 00:14:00.980]   is one of the most underappreciated areas
[00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:02.560]   that I remember reading years ago
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:03.520]   in Tom Stanley's books.
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:04.980]   He talked about junkyard,
[00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:07.700]   people who run junkyards
[00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:10.600]   and recycling centers and things like that.
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.120]   Is that he was talking about
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.260]   the wage in this industry.
[00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.420]   The standard for an owner of a company
[00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:16.580]   can be over a million bucks a year
[00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:17.460]   and that's kind of the standard.
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:19.980]   So I think that's a very low status symbol
[00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:21.120]   or blue collar work.
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:23.360]   You could easily have blue collar workers,
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:25.420]   a guy who runs his own plumbing truck
[00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:27.060]   making six figures a year
[00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:29.140]   but he doesn't have the same social status.
[00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:31.000]   So the first thing is
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.180]   what do I want with life?
[00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:33.140]   What do I want for me?
[00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:35.220]   And that's where goal setting comes in
[00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:36.180]   and kind of just laying out
[00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:38.140]   an ideal picture of the future
[00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:39.100]   and a vision of the future.
[00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:42.020]   And that probably never changes
[00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:43.840]   because it adjusts as time goes on.
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:46.200]   And there are certain levels of
[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:48.260]   if we go through the Maslow's hierarchy of needs,
[00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:49.840]   same thing with there are certain levels
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:52.380]   of action steps that you have to achieve
[00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:54.600]   with finance to be able to even have
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:55.880]   the ability to think bigger.
[00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:57.620]   If you're behind in all of your bills,
[00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:00.000]   the creditors are calling constantly,
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.320]   you don't have a great income,
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:04.840]   then before you can sit back and say,
[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.420]   well, what would I do with Joshua's
[00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:07.460]   $10 million question?
[00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:08.620]   You might have to say,
[00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:09.780]   I want to be current on my bills
[00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:11.240]   and I got to figure out how to go
[00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:14.600]   from $8 an hour to $9 an hour
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:16.600]   to $11 an hour to $15 an hour
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:18.440]   to even think of going from $50 an hour
[00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:19.720]   to $15 an hour.
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:21.300]   So there's a growth and that's good.
[00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:21.760]   That's great.
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:22.300]   That's normal.
[00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:23.500]   There's a growth and a progression
[00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:24.640]   of everything we do in life.
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:26.540]   But once we know where we are,
[00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:27.540]   where we're going,
[00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:28.660]   so back to my business metaphor,
[00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:30.420]   what does this business exist to do?
[00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:31.460]   Who do we serve?
[00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:33.460]   What is our purpose?
[00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:35.840]   Our raison d'etre,
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:38.120]   our reason for being.
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:40.900]   Why are we here?
[00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:41.600]   What are we doing?
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.260]   Now, once we solve that,
[00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:44.800]   we got to start with the second step
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.020]   is what do we have?
[00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:48.220]   So if I were selling you a business
[00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:48.420]   and you were selling me a business,
[00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:50.060]   you were coming in to turn this business around
[00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:50.780]   because it was struggling.
[00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:52.460]   Once you've answered that question,
[00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:53.720]   at least in a simple way,
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:54.740]   what do we serve?
[00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:55.640]   So if this is dry cleaning,
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:57.640]   we're trying to get people quality dry cleaning
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:58.800]   and a quick, efficient service.
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:15:59.360]   Done.
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:00.160]   Simple as that.
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.020]   It doesn't have to be about saving the world
[00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:04.420]   and solving all of the social problems
[00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:06.280]   of the world.
[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:08.240]   Rather, it can be something very simple
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:08.780]   and straightforward,
[00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:10.020]   but you need to know what it is.
[00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:12.640]   It can be big and fancy
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:15.580]   and brilliant as far as making you feel like
[00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:18.360]   it's really going to be a world-changing impact.
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:20.140]   But then once we know,
[00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:21.440]   where are we going?
[00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:22.020]   What are the goals?
[00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:23.220]   Then we start with what do we have?
[00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:24.460]   What do we got?
[00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:26.360]   What assets do we have?
[00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:27.620]   What liabilities do we have?
[00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:29.620]   Now, with assets and liabilities,
[00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:31.920]   there are various financial assets
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:33.100]   and financial liabilities
[00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:35.840]   and there are various non-financial assets
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:37.300]   and non-financial liabilities.
[00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:38.600]   And this is very important
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:40.940]   because a lot of times with financial planning,
[00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:43.100]   we're going to talk about the financial assets
[00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:44.280]   and the financial liabilities.
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:45.600]   But the truth is,
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:46.700]   is just like yesterday,
[00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:47.940]   I talked through the difference
[00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:48.380]   between real estate,
[00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:49.820]   real assets and financial assets.
[00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:52.360]   We have the same thing with real assets
[00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:53.340]   and real liabilities
[00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:54.300]   and financial assets
[00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:55.300]   and financial liabilities.
[00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:58.220]   Or I don't like the word real so much
[00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:00.560]   because real implies what I'm talking about,
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:02.500]   real assets with real estate,
[00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:03.760]   capital buildings,
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:04.500]   machinery, equipment,
[00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:05.100]   that type of thing.
[00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:07.060]   So I'm going to use non-financial assets
[00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:08.320]   and non-financial liabilities
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:09.760]   that can be exercised
[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:10.920]   to turn into financial assets
[00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:11.940]   and financial liabilities.
[00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:14.860]   So in a business,
[00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:17.280]   a non-financial asset would be
[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:20.440]   like, and again,
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:21.620]   accountants don't get mad at me
[00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:23.740]   because some of these cross the boundary.
[00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:24.920]   So I would use in a business
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:26.460]   something like intellectual property.
[00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:28.220]   I would call that a non-financial asset
[00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:29.440]   for the purpose of this conversation,
[00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:31.340]   but that would actually be valued
[00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:32.560]   on a business balance sheet
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:35.120]   depending on what type of accounting
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:35.680]   that we're using.
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:36.980]   For today, let's keep it simple.
[00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:38.800]   So we're going to have a non-financial asset
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:40.260]   like our employees.
[00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:41.680]   We're going to have a non-financial asset
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:42.500]   like a real asset,
[00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:43.700]   like our building, our equipment,
[00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:45.920]   our plant, our, if we're a dry cleaner,
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.500]   our dry cleaning machines, our racks.
[00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:48.280]   We're going to have
[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:50.200]   our customers, our customer base,
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:51.040]   our goodwill,
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:53.560]   the reputation that we have
[00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:54.160]   in the marketplace.
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:55.220]   That would be for a business.
[00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:56.680]   Now in our own life,
[00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:57.760]   isn't it the same thing?
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:00.420]   We all have a certain reputation.
[00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:02.800]   We all have certain skills,
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:03.660]   certain knowledge,
[00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:04.460]   certain abilities,
[00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:05.600]   certain experience
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:08.000]   that gives us our ability
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.740]   to go out and transform
[00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:11.060]   those non-financial assets
[00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:12.520]   into financial assets.
[00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:14.320]   So in goal setting,
[00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:15.660]   one of the things that we would want to talk about
[00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:16.600]   is we want to make a list
[00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:18.200]   of all of our non-financial assets
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:18.520]   and what we're going to do
[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:20.840]   What can I do better than anything else?
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:22.160]   So for example, for me,
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.840]   I have a tremendous skill
[00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:25.660]   and knowledge
[00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:27.720]   of technical financial planning.
[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:29.460]   That doesn't turn into money
[00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:30.840]   unless I have a customer,
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:32.420]   but that is an asset that I have.
[00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:33.820]   I've got a bunch of crazy letters
[00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:34.420]   after my name
[00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:35.160]   that really all they say
[00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:36.080]   is I'm good at taking tests
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:37.080]   and memorizing information.
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:39.720]   So this is a certain knowledge base
[00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:41.680]   that supposedly is supposed to mean
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:42.660]   something to some people.
[00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:43.860]   Now I can take that
[00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:44.880]   and I can leverage that
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.400]   in the financial community
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:47.360]   and I could leverage that
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:48.120]   into getting an interview
[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:49.920]   at just about any financial firm
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:51.200]   that I wanted to get an interview at
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.640]   because I've developed that knowledge
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:53.440]   and skill and ability.
[00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:54.820]   And I hope this doesn't sound arrogant.
[00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:55.760]   It's not meant to sound arrogant.
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:56.900]   It's just meant to sound real.
[00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:58.540]   When I was first starting
[00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:01.920]   as a financial planner six years ago,
[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:04.520]   then yes, I could get interviews
[00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:06.200]   with people at different firms,
[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:08.000]   but it was very different than today
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.740]   where I get about a recruiting call a week
[00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:11.560]   or in the past half,
[00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:12.480]   I get a LinkedIn message
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:13.420]   from a recruiter saying,
[00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:14.340]   hey, look at my interest.
[00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:14.920]   I get emails.
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:15.700]   I get phone calls.
[00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:16.780]   It's very flattering.
[00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:19.720]   And so it could lead
[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:21.700]   to great financial gain.
[00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:22.460]   So for example,
[00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:24.620]   it's nice to have a backup plan
[00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:26.800]   where knowing that I could always go out
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:27.480]   if I want one,
[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:28.440]   I could always go out
[00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:30.560]   and get a six-figure job
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:31.400]   working in the industry
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:32.500]   that I know pretty well.
[00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:33.420]   That's a really nice,
[00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:34.740]   comforting feeling to have.
[00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:35.540]   And who knows?
[00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:37.620]   Maybe I'll need to do that in the future.
[00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:40.340]   But that comes from assets
[00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:41.720]   and knowledge base that I have.
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:42.700]   Well, it's the same for you.
[00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:44.120]   So what are your assets
[00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:45.940]   and what are your non-financial assets?
[00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:47.420]   What are your non-financial skills,
[00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:48.020]   your abilities,
[00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:49.340]   the things that you can leverage?
[00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:52.620]   If you have the ability to cook,
[00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:54.620]   well, this is something that you can leverage.
[00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:57.140]   And if you have the ability to not just cook,
[00:19:57.140 --> 00:20:01.580]   but you have the ability to create a masterful menu,
[00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:04.080]   a masterful cuisine,
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:05.620]   this is what makes a difference
[00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:08.240]   between being a line cook at Denny's
[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:10.060]   and being an executive chef
[00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:12.940]   or whatever the word is in that chef industry
[00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:17.720]   at the most acclaimed, admired restaurant in town.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.280]   So these non-financial assets
[00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:25.240]   really build our ability
[00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:26.700]   to earn financial assets.
[00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:29.040]   And we've got to develop the human capital
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:30.720]   to be able to build the financial capital.
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:33.660]   So I don't want to spend too much time on this today,
[00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:35.700]   but if you were to read any good career book
[00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:36.660]   or any coaching book,
[00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:37.980]   it would start by saying,
[00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:39.500]   what are your abilities?
[00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:41.240]   What is it that you do well?
[00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:42.640]   What are your assets?
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:43.660]   What are your strengths?
[00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:45.840]   And so whether this would be a psychological profile
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:46.860]   like StrengthsFinders
[00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:47.980]   or whether this would be a psychological profile
[00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:48.920]   or whether this would be a,
[00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:50.240]   what's it called,
[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:52.980]   the four different INTG
[00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:54.740]   or these psychological profiles
[00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:55.820]   that can be helpful to say,
[00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:57.040]   here's what I like to do.
[00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:58.400]   Here's what I enjoy.
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:00.520]   Those would be ways of trying to figure out
[00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:01.340]   what your assets are
[00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:02.520]   and what your liabilities are.
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:04.600]   If you're a detailed person
[00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:05.720]   or not a detailed person,
[00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:07.360]   there is room for both of them.
[00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:09.160]   But if you're not a detailed person,
[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:11.120]   I would suggest don't take a job
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:12.680]   as a staff accountant at a firm
[00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:15.180]   because to be a staff accountant,
[00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:17.200]   you need to be able to be a detailed person
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:17.960]   and enjoy working there.
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:18.020]   You need to be able to be a detailed person
[00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:18.860]   and enjoy working through the details.
[00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:20.760]   So understand what your assets are
[00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:21.920]   and what your liabilities are.
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:23.100]   That's for another show.
[00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:24.480]   But hopefully that's a bit of an introduction.
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:25.880]   So let's go to the financial assets.
[00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:27.640]   Well, with financial assets,
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:29.760]   this would be trying to figure out
[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:31.400]   what is the money that we have
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:32.580]   and where is it going
[00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:33.740]   and where is it coming from?
[00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:35.260]   And so in business,
[00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:36.220]   if we were in business,
[00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:38.300]   there are four basic financial statements
[00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:41.380]   that run all businesses.
[00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:42.880]   And I promise we won't get too heavy
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:44.060]   into the financial accounting here.
[00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:45.280]   But in business,
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:47.060]   there are four basic financial statements.
[00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:47.840]   And so,
[00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:49.740]   if you hired me to turn your business around
[00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:51.780]   or if I hired you to turn my...
[00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:53.120]   Let's go the other way.
[00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:54.740]   You hired me to turn your business around.
[00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:56.400]   The very first thing I would do
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:57.460]   is we would have a conversation
[00:21:57.460 --> 00:21:58.280]   about what's our purpose,
[00:21:58.280 --> 00:21:58.880]   what's our mission,
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:21:59.440]   what's our vision,
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:00.340]   what are we trying to do,
[00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:02.060]   do we have any chance of doing it?
[00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:04.160]   And then we're going to go look at the numbers.
[00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:05.240]   And in business,
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:07.400]   here are the four financial statements
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:08.360]   that we're going to review.
[00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:09.580]   And just a very quick overview.
[00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:11.240]   Don't tune me out on this
[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:13.040]   because if you want to have any skill
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:14.000]   of being an investor,
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.220]   so for example,
[00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:16.800]   any skill of analyzing companies,
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:17.920]   analyzing business opportunities,
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:20.540]   to any degree that goes beyond just,
[00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:22.020]   okay, I'm going to buy an index fund,
[00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:23.100]   which there's nothing wrong with that.
[00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:24.240]   But if you want to have any skill,
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:26.080]   you need to understand these statements
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:27.560]   and how these work together.
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:29.500]   So the first would be a balance sheet.
[00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:31.640]   This is called a statement of financial position.
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:33.620]   I don't care which one name you use.
[00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:34.220]   It doesn't matter.
[00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:36.700]   But a balance sheet simply tells you
[00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:39.660]   what your current financial position is.
[00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:42.620]   It tells you all of the economic resources
[00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:43.680]   that you have
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:46.680]   and all of the sources of financing
[00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:47.420]   that you have
[00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:47.900]   and all of the resources
[00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:47.960]   that you have.
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:49.460]   And it tells you where you are
[00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:51.240]   at a specific point in time.
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:53.760]   And so in business accounting,
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:56.780]   this would be the basic accounting formula
[00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:57.500]   that you would learn
[00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:59.220]   in financial accounting 101 in college
[00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:01.900]   is your assets equals your liabilities
[00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:04.200]   plus your stockholders' equity
[00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:05.280]   or your shareholders' equity.
[00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:07.040]   So assets equal liabilities
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:08.080]   plus shareholders' equity.
[00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:10.560]   And this is the basic accounting equation
[00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:12.000]   that everything is built around.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.140]   And so here you would see a listing.
[00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:15.740]   If you looked at a business balance sheet,
[00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:17.800]   you would see a listing of all of the cash,
[00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:19.360]   all of the accounts receivable,
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:22.040]   all of the current value of the real assets
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:23.240]   such as plants and equipment,
[00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:24.900]   all of the money that's owed,
[00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:26.060]   any notes payable,
[00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:28.160]   any liabilities that are outstanding.
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:30.280]   And then the shareholders' equity
[00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:31.420]   in the beginning would be
[00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:32.780]   the contributed capital.
[00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:34.400]   So how much money was invested
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:36.520]   into the business at the beginning.
[00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:38.320]   Now we can simplify this over
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:39.620]   to the world of personal finance
[00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:41.560]   and we can create a personal statement
[00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:42.420]   of financial position,
[00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:43.600]   a personal balance sheet.
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.800]   And this one can be a little bit simpler.
[00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:47.860]   We can dispense with the stockholders' equity
[00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:49.060]   and we call that net worth.
[00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:51.660]   So then we have assets and liabilities.
[00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:53.520]   And so today we're going to talk about
[00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:54.700]   how to calculate this
[00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:56.220]   and how to create one for yourself
[00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:58.760]   because this will be the first informational statement
[00:23:58.760 --> 00:23:59.380]   that you need.
[00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:02.140]   Now briefly before we get into the details of that,
[00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:05.420]   I want to cover the other three financial statements
[00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:06.300]   that work in business.
[00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:08.700]   And not all of these are going to be necessary
[00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:10.360]   for your personal financial accounting,
[00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:12.720]   but I want you to see how valuable these are.
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:15.640]   So the second of the financial statements
[00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:16.720]   that you would prepare in business
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:17.840]   or if I were turning your business around,
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:19.080]   that I would ask for
[00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:20.400]   or you would have prepared for me,
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:21.920]   would be an income statement.
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:23.920]   So an income statement would be called
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:25.340]   also a statement of income,
[00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:26.520]   a statement of earnings,
[00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:27.660]   or a statement of operations.
[00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:29.260]   So depending on what nature of accounting,
[00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:30.200]   are we doing gap accounting,
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:31.900]   are we doing non-gap accounting,
[00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:33.120]   are we doing the international standards,
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:35.060]   depending on who your accountant is,
[00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:36.140]   it's called everything.
[00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:37.580]   So I'm just going to call it an income statement.
[00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:39.060]   And an income statement
[00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:42.840]   will report the primary measure
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:44.740]   of economic performance during a period.
[00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:46.220]   It talks about what's our income
[00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:47.260]   and what are our expenses.
[00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:49.920]   So the income statement would list all revenues
[00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:52.120]   from sales in your business
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:55.080]   and would subtract out the cost of goods sold,
[00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:58.840]   any expenses incurred for selling the goods,
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:00.300]   and any interest expenses.
[00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:01.600]   And this would equal our net income.
[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:03.600]   So in business, we have an income statement.
[00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:06.100]   And this would be an important statement
[00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:08.080]   that we're going to review
[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:10.780]   because revenue is listed on this income statement
[00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:11.700]   and our net income.
[00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:14.820]   Revenue minus expenses equals our net income.
[00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:16.480]   Then the third statement
[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:17.800]   would be the statement of retirement.
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:20.440]   And so the statement of retained earnings
[00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:22.660]   reports the way that the net income
[00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:26.080]   and the distribution of dividends to the shareholders
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:28.900]   have affected the financial position of the company
[00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:30.300]   during the accounting period.
[00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:33.400]   So the balance sheet was a specific point in time.
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:36.540]   These other income statements are during a period of time.
[00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:39.060]   So over a year, over a month, over a quarter,
[00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:40.420]   over a decade, depends.
[00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:41.960]   Usually they'll be quarterly or annually.
[00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:44.840]   But this would be the statement of retained earnings.
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:47.400]   And basically what it says is we would say,
[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:47.780]   okay, we're going to have a net income
[00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:50.200]   Okay, how much retained earnings did we have at the beginning?
[00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:53.540]   How much net income was added to it?
[00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:56.280]   How much did we pay out in dividends to our shareholders?
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:58.100]   And what's our ending retained earnings?
[00:25:58.100 --> 00:25:59.920]   What is the amount of money that we have
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:01.160]   at the end of the accounting period?
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:04.900]   So this would be the statement of retained earnings
[00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:06.220]   in a financial accounting.
[00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:08.700]   And the fourth one would be the statement of cash flows.
[00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:10.580]   And so the statement of cash flows
[00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:12.860]   reports any inflows of cash,
[00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:15.040]   so receipts for sales,
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:17.580]   and any outflows of cash,
[00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:17.760]   or payments for sales,
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:19.940]   or payments during the accounting period
[00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:22.420]   across all the categories of operations,
[00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:23.960]   investing, and financing.
[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:26.680]   So whether that means we had an inflow of cash
[00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:29.220]   from a loan that we've taken out,
[00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:31.600]   or an inflow of cash from an investment activity,
[00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:35.820]   or an inflow of cash from the sale
[00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:38.340]   from the income statement,
[00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:41.840]   this would be where we'd track those cash inflows and outflows.
[00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:45.520]   And so we would capture the cash that we collect from customers,
[00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:46.840]   the cash that we pay to suppliers,
[00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:47.740]   the cash that we pay to our customers,
[00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:48.700]   the cash that we pay to purchase equipment,
[00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:50.340]   and the cash that we borrow from banks.
[00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:52.280]   These are the four basic statements.
[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:54.000]   And in accounting, you'll quickly learn,
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.220]   you'll learn how these function together.
[00:26:56.220 --> 00:27:00.060]   And what there is is that there's a basic flow between them,
[00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:02.360]   and there's a working between all of these numbers.
[00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:04.040]   So on the income statement,
[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:05.080]   we would have the retained,
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:07.820]   the revenues minus the expenses equals our net income.
[00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:09.600]   That net income would flow over
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:11.060]   onto the statement of retained earnings,
[00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:13.540]   where we would have the beginning retained earnings
[00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:15.540]   plus the net income minus the dividend,
[00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:17.720]   and that would equal the ending retained earnings,
[00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:21.040]   the statement of cash flows would take all the cash flows in,
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:23.520]   all the cash flows out.
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:25.540]   That would flow over onto the balance sheet
[00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:28.140]   as far as the cash on the current balance sheet,
[00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:30.940]   the cash plus the assets minus the liabilities,
[00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:32.820]   and then the contributed capital
[00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:34.400]   would wind up being our retained earnings.
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:35.380]   Okay, done.
[00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:37.140]   That was three minutes of heavy accounting,
[00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:38.880]   which that was financial accounting 101,
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:41.720]   but this was an important statement.
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:44.140]   So how can we simplify this for personal financial?
[00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:46.060]   Well, in personal financial planning,
[00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:47.700]   we're basically going to work with two financial statements.
[00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:49.960]   The first financial statement
[00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:51.440]   would be a statement of financial position,
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:52.140]   a balance sheet,
[00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:54.600]   and the second financial statement
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:56.000]   would be a statement of cash flows.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.920]   These are the primary statements
[00:27:58.920 --> 00:27:59.760]   that we're going to work with.
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:02.620]   We don't need necessarily all the rest of it.
[00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:05.280]   Although we could create them,
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:07.380]   but they're kind of unnecessarily complicated,
[00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:09.200]   especially for an audio podcast.
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:13.520]   But if you understand how the back and forth
[00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:15.060]   between the business and the personal life,
[00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:17.680]   it makes it valuable and helpful
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:20.760]   to know how to work these statements.
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:25.820]   So one of the biggest things that I want to talk about
[00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:28.220]   is that if you'll start preparing these statements
[00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:29.760]   for yourself and tracking them,
[00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:33.240]   you will be a better investor and a better business owner.
[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:36.700]   And I believe it's very powerful
[00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:38.780]   that all of us should be viewing ourselves
[00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:39.980]   as in our own business.
[00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:41.980]   All of us are in our own business.
[00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:44.480]   Now, whether that means that we have one client,
[00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:46.800]   i.e. the employer that we have right now,
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:47.660]   or whether that means we have a business
[00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:48.900]   that we have 30 clients
[00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:51.100]   because we run an independent consulting practice,
[00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:51.920]   it doesn't matter.
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:53.500]   We're all in business for ourselves.
[00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:56.500]   And so a basic understanding of the language of business
[00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:58.380]   will go miles towards helping you
[00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:00.720]   to run your personal finances in a better way.
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:03.720]   And the very first language of business is with numbers.
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:06.880]   Now, I don't think necessarily that we all have to be nerds.
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:07.940]   And so people would say,
[00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:09.580]   well, Josh, would I really have to do this?
[00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:11.040]   I'm not the accounting type.
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:12.560]   I'm not the right brain logical,
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:15.800]   you know, pencil licking accounting type.
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:17.620]   Well, I've got three answers to that.
[00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:19.200]   Number one, don't be ridiculous.
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:20.560]   It's your money.
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:21.360]   It's your life.
[00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:22.740]   Why do you not care about it?
[00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:25.000]   No matter how artsy you are
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.040]   and no matter how big picture thinking you are
[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:29.500]   and no matter how creative
[00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:30.880]   and I'm not the numbers type,
[00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:32.180]   this stuff matters.
[00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:34.500]   Because if you want to have the ability
[00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:36.960]   to stay at home and paint every day,
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:39.280]   you've got to understand at least the basics
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:40.080]   to be able to say,
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:41.360]   how am I going to fund my life
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:42.400]   to be able to paint every day?
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:43.840]   It's not that tough.
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:45.180]   So number one, don't be ridiculous.
[00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:47.080]   Number two, it's okay.
[00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:49.520]   You could probably automate some of this,
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:51.200]   but you need to understand it.
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:52.360]   Okay?
[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:53.780]   You can automate some of this
[00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:54.720]   so it happens pretty easily,
[00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:55.880]   but you need to understand it.
[00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:58.500]   If you are just simply saying,
[00:29:58.500 --> 00:29:59.060]   well, I'm just not,
[00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:00.020]   I'm going to ignore it,
[00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:02.640]   then you're going to get bad results.
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:04.300]   There's no person that's running a company
[00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:05.320]   that ever gets good results
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:06.700]   that doesn't pay attention to the numbers.
[00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:08.360]   One of the most important things you have to do
[00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:09.420]   is pay attention to the numbers.
[00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:11.240]   And if you're listening to a show like this,
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:12.140]   I assume you care,
[00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:14.660]   but you don't have to be a nerd about it.
[00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:15.520]   You don't have to be me.
[00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:16.340]   When I get excited,
[00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:16.960]   I make a spreadsheet.
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:17.360]   My wife,
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:19.400]   my wife and I joke.
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:20.160]   I often tell her,
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:21.280]   I got excited about this,
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:22.180]   so I went and made a spreadsheet.
[00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:23.740]   I mean, it's motivating.
[00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:24.640]   If I figure out,
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:27.420]   here's how I could save $38 on my car insurance
[00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:28.720]   without giving up any of the benefits
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:29.660]   that are exciting to me,
[00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:30.320]   and look,
[00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:31.900]   if we project that $38 forward
[00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:33.440]   over the next 48 years,
[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:36.200]   this results in another million dollars of net worth
[00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:36.800]   if I invest it,
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:37.500]   blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:39.040]   I get excited by that,
[00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:40.040]   but you don't have to be me.
[00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:40.580]   It's okay.
[00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:42.700]   So you can automate it,
[00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:43.980]   or you can hire it.
[00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:46.180]   So you can hire someone to do this for you.
[00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:47.580]   You can have an accountant prepare this
[00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:47.840]   for you.
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:49.560]   You can have a bookkeeper to prepare this for you.
[00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:51.340]   You can hire a financial advisor,
[00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:52.740]   a financial planner to work with this,
[00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:54.360]   but you've got to understand it.
[00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:56.160]   You can't sit back and say,
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:58.160]   well, I'm going to let someone else run my stuff for me.
[00:30:58.160 --> 00:30:59.220]   You've got to understand it.
[00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:00.900]   No matter how much you trust,
[00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:02.740]   you still need to understand what's going on.
[00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:04.160]   And so, yes,
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:05.700]   I don't expect people to,
[00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:08.740]   I wouldn't expect people who are financially advanced
[00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:10.440]   to sit there and say,
[00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:12.180]   I'm going to prepare all these statements for myself.
[00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:13.560]   The CEO of,
[00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:14.760]   insert big company here,
[00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:16.740]   does not prepare his own financial statements.
[00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:17.560]   He has a chief,
[00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:18.360]   a chief financial officer,
[00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:19.440]   and the chief financial officer
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:21.080]   does not prepare his own financial statements.
[00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:22.440]   The chief financial officer
[00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:23.400]   has a team of accountants,
[00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:24.320]   and those team of accountants
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:25.540]   has a team of assistants,
[00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:27.140]   depending on the,
[00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:29.540]   depending on the size of the company.
[00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:30.100]   But this,
[00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:31.260]   the accountants prepare the statements.
[00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:33.060]   The CFO goes over it with the accountant.
[00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:35.560]   The CFO then presents it to the CEO.
[00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:37.560]   They talk about the meaning and the impact of it.
[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:38.820]   But if you're running a company,
[00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:40.920]   and you don't understand where you're at financially,
[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:41.920]   you are doomed.
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:44.040]   You're doomed.
[00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:46.240]   Same thing with personal financial planning.
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:47.540]   Show me something
[00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:49.520]   who understands numbers
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:51.620]   and the basics of how these things work,
[00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:52.820]   and I'll show you somebody
[00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:53.980]   that over a period of time
[00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:55.800]   will wind up very, very wealthy.
[00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:56.900]   Show me someone
[00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:58.960]   who doesn't understand the basics of these numbers
[00:31:58.960 --> 00:31:59.940]   and how these things work,
[00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:01.140]   and I'll show you somebody
[00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:02.860]   that's swindled repeatedly
[00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:04.680]   and that never has any money
[00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:05.520]   because they can't plan.
[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:08.680]   Now, this is not complicated.
[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:11.440]   It's fairly simple,
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:13.340]   but you do have to learn a little bit.
[00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:15.840]   But if you take your most important goal
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:17.520]   and figure out what's your most important goal,
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:19.940]   and figure out how money plays into it,
[00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:21.880]   I guarantee money plays into it in some way.
[00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:24.500]   So this is worth learning.
[00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:26.160]   All right, rant over.
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:27.380]   Going to move on.
[00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:28.560]   So today we're going to talk about
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:31.500]   how to prepare a statement of financial position.
[00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:33.180]   Hopefully I've sold you on the value
[00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:34.080]   and the importance of it.
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:35.560]   Hopefully I didn't lose you
[00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:42.860]   in going into the depth of financial accounting.
[00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:44.680]   But I wanted to show you how there is a parallel
[00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:46.740]   between business finance and personal finance.
[00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:47.500]   And you will see that
[00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:49.460]   I would never invest in a company that could...
[00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:50.320]   Put it this way.
[00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:52.500]   I would never invest in a company
[00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:54.440]   that couldn't show me accurate financial statements
[00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:56.580]   because those accurate financial statements
[00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:59.120]   will show you everything that's going on in the company.
[00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:01.240]   And if you can read a financial statement,
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:04.560]   you can know everything there is to know about a company
[00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:06.760]   if you know how to read a financial statement.
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:07.980]   I love studying this.
[00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:08.900]   I'm not great at it.
[00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:10.160]   I'm learning to be better at it.
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.900]   But to me, I enjoy this immensely.
[00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:16.320]   And this skill is a tremendously valuable skill
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:17.480]   because it affects every area of life.
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:19.300]   So hopefully I've sold you on the concept
[00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:21.200]   of preparing some financial statements.
[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:23.800]   So let's talk into how do you do this.
[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:25.300]   So today, we're going to cover
[00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:27.300]   how do you prepare a statement of financial condition.
[00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:28.920]   And then I'm just going to talk about
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:30.940]   what is some of the information that you can use from it.
[00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:31.740]   And then we're done for today.
[00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:33.260]   Another day, we'll talk about
[00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:34.760]   how to prepare a statement of cash flows.
[00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:36.100]   And that will lead me ultimately
[00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:37.160]   where I wanted to go today,
[00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:38.980]   which was into kind of understanding,
[00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:40.660]   and this is a made-up word that I made up.
[00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:41.840]   You don't see this in literature.
[00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:43.100]   A statement of liabilities,
[00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:44.800]   which would basically be a schedule of all the debts
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:46.440]   and all of the terms and all the interest rates
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:47.460]   so you can figure out
[00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:49.360]   what order and how to go about paying off debt.
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:52.060]   But is it good to say to someone,
[00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:53.500]   pay off your debt and use a debt snowball?
[00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:55.180]   Sure, that can be fine to a point.
[00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:57.540]   But let's go a little bit deeper
[00:33:57.540 --> 00:33:59.200]   and let's understand what's behind that.
[00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:01.300]   And instead of just simply giving people this idea
[00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:02.880]   that gets them motivated for 12 months
[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:03.540]   and then they're done
[00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:05.320]   and then they go into debt again 12 months later,
[00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:08.460]   let's talk about how to be a little bit more sophisticated
[00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:11.560]   and understand how all of these things work together.
[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:14.500]   So how do you make a statement of financial condition?
[00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:16.340]   Reference in the show notes,
[00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:19.260]   the template statement of financial condition
[00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:20.580]   that I have put in the show notes.
[00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:22.280]   And I've built this as a Google spreadsheet.
[00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:23.380]   It's very simple.
[00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:24.800]   You can do this with a spreadsheet
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:26.600]   and you can do this with a pen and a piece of paper.
[00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:29.340]   And if your financial life is fairly simple
[00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:29.960]   and straightforward,
[00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:32.500]   you can make this simple and straightforward.
[00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:36.280]   If your financial life is complicated and intricate,
[00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:39.160]   this will be very complicated and intricate.
[00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:40.760]   It doesn't matter to me,
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:42.220]   but this would be the very first step
[00:34:42.220 --> 00:34:43.340]   if I were coaching somebody,
[00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:45.340]   whether they owned 18 businesses
[00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:47.380]   or whether they own,
[00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:49.700]   no business and earned a $40,000 straight salary,
[00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:51.720]   we're still going to make exactly the same document.
[00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:53.360]   So we start with the assets.
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:55.920]   Now, in this world,
[00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:58.440]   I'm purely talking now about financial assets.
[00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:00.760]   I'm talking about the financial assets,
[00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:03.160]   things that we could sell and get money out of them.
[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:05.000]   And so in our financial assets,
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.520]   we're going to have three categories
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:09.740]   into which we're going to categorize all of our assets.
[00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:12.360]   Number one would be cash or cash equivalents.
[00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:14.060]   Number two would be investments.
[00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:16.660]   And number three would be use assets.
[00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:20.340]   Cash, cash equivalents, investments and use assets.
[00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:22.780]   So let's walk through these categories
[00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:24.180]   and I'll give you examples of these.
[00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:26.780]   In the spreadsheet that I've prepared for you to use,
[00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:28.920]   you'll see that there's not,
[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:30.460]   you're not going to,
[00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:33.840]   no one's going to have all of these asset names.
[00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:35.880]   I've put in the general categories
[00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:37.220]   to remind you about them.
[00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:39.120]   But what I would do if I were filling this in
[00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:41.180]   is I would fill in each individual account,
[00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:43.600]   the name of it and the location of it
[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:45.000]   and then the type of account it is
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.200]   so that I could have a complete list.
[00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:49.560]   It's not a big deal if you've got 38 accounts.
[00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:52.600]   It's not a big deal to have 38 accounts listed on a statement
[00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:54.320]   because you're just mainly looking at how much cash,
[00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:57.080]   how many investments and how much use assets do I have
[00:35:57.080 --> 00:35:58.500]   and then what's the amount of my liabilities.
[00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:00.000]   So list them out in the way that,
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.400]   with the names that make sense to you.
[00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:03.640]   But I've put in a number of different varieties
[00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:10.760]   of categories for you to use as your, to help you.
[00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:12.720]   So number one would be cash or cash equivalents.
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:15.580]   So cash in the financial accounting world
[00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:17.360]   is basically considered to be things
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:20.160]   that things that can be turned into cash
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:22.300]   in a very short period of time that's very liquid.
[00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:24.720]   And so the first example of this would be cash,
[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:27.920]   meaning, I mean, physical Federal Reserve notes,
[00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:31.540]   physical green dollar bills, physical cash.
[00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:33.800]   And I think it's a really great idea
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:36.780]   to always have some amount of physical cash on hand.
[00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:38.980]   You would be surprised what you could do
[00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:41.220]   if you'll always keep physical cash on hand.
[00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:43.320]   Now, there may be various reasons for this.
[00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:45.440]   So you may pull over on the side of the road,
[00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:46.800]   see somebody selling something
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:47.340]   and say, hey, I'm going to buy this.
[00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:48.180]   And they'll say, listen, you know,
[00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:49.640]   somebody selling a car or a boat.
[00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:52.120]   And just the fact that you've got some money in your pocket
[00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:53.940]   and can offer them cash on the spot
[00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:56.220]   and can make a dramatic difference
[00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:58.700]   in their willingness to sell the asset to you quickly.
[00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:00.580]   So consider it for that.
[00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:02.500]   Consider it for emergency preparedness.
[00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:05.220]   So I always like to keep some cash handy
[00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:06.080]   in case of a hurricane.
[00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:06.860]   I live in Florida.
[00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:08.700]   We may have a hurricane come in.
[00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:12.420]   The, you know, the power may be out for a couple of weeks.
[00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:15.560]   And so if I need to hire somebody to come in
[00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:17.320]   and cut down the trees that are on my property,
[00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:19.040]   because my chainsaw is not working,
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:21.680]   you know, some $20 bills and, I don't know,
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:22.940]   maybe something to barter with,
[00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:25.080]   a case of beer or something like that.
[00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:26.900]   So some, you know, these,
[00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:28.600]   this can have some tremendous ability.
[00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:30.980]   I bet you after, after a hurricane,
[00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:32.660]   if you had a cooler full of ice and cold beer,
[00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:34.420]   that probably gets you farther than a $20 bill.
[00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:36.320]   But the $20 bills will get some money,
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:37.160]   get some things done.
[00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:40.100]   This happened on my property some months ago.
[00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:42.340]   I was, there was a guy down the street cutting,
[00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:45.540]   cutting some trees down and, and grinding some stumps.
[00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:47.080]   And I had some stumps in my backyard
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:47.300]   and I needed to cut some trees down.
[00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:47.960]   I needed ground out.
[00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:50.780]   I had planned to, to call somebody and have them come by.
[00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:53.320]   But if you call a guy who runs a stump grinding business,
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:55.020]   he's got to charge you a fee to get out there.
[00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:56.960]   He's got to cover his gas to get out there in his crew.
[00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:00.020]   I got a nice discounted race rate by just saying,
[00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:01.440]   Hey, you've got your machine here.
[00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:03.120]   Could you swing by and grind my stumps?
[00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:04.960]   15 minutes later, my stumps were ground
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:06.460]   and I got a substantial discount,
[00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:07.700]   put some cash in his pocket
[00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:09.580]   because he didn't need to send his,
[00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:12.080]   he didn't need to send his crew out special
[00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:14.160]   just for my, just for my job.
[00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:16.060]   So we would list out any cash.
[00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:17.280]   And so whether that's cash that you're using
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:18.040]   that you keep at home,
[00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:21.600]   cash that you keep in a safe deposit box of some kind,
[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:23.220]   whatever the situation is,
[00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:24.280]   there's going to be,
[00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:26.680]   there's going to be some cash that you're going to list out.
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:28.540]   Number two would be checking accounts.
[00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:30.520]   So do you have any checking accounts?
[00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:32.120]   And this would be across the board,
[00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:33.200]   list your checking accounts.
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:34.560]   Number three, savings accounts.
[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:36.720]   So list any savings accounts that you have.
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:39.180]   Number four would be money market deposit accounts
[00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:39.920]   held at a bank.
[00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:42.000]   So there are two types of money markets.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.580]   Number four is money market deposit accounts
[00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:44.200]   held at a bank.
[00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:46.420]   Number five would be money market mutual funds
[00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:47.260]   held in an investment.
[00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:49.220]   So list out any money markets.
[00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:53.760]   If you have a portfolio of CDs that are close to maturity,
[00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:55.520]   I would list those out.
[00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:58.040]   So if you had a five-year CD,
[00:38:58.040 --> 00:38:59.340]   is that equivalent to cash?
[00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:02.040]   I wouldn't call that.
[00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:03.260]   I might put that in the,
[00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:05.320]   I would put that one into the investment category.
[00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:07.400]   But if you had a CD that was coming due next month,
[00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:08.380]   I would list that in cash.
[00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:10.540]   Or if you had any kind of laddered CDs,
[00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:11.920]   I would list that in,
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:13.780]   I would list that in the cash,
[00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:15.740]   in the cash situation as well.
[00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:17.240]   So that would be all the money markets.
[00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:18.740]   All of your cash or your cash equivalent.
[00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:19.860]   So make a note of,
[00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:20.760]   make a note of that.
[00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:23.040]   In those,
[00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:24.780]   one additional aspect,
[00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:27.800]   you wouldn't generally prepare this as a,
[00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:30.720]   you wouldn't generally put this on a formal financial statement.
[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:33.880]   But I would consider adding any interest rates
[00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:35.000]   that you're receiving on these.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.440]   And this would be kind of one for later.
[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:38.420]   But if you have cash held in one bank account,
[00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:40.740]   you know, let's say you have bank account A
[00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:44.720]   and it's paying you 0.03% interest rate in today's world.
[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:46.620]   And you have maybe an online account.
[00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:47.160]   So online,
[00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:49.100]   bank account B at 2% interest rate,
[00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:51.080]   write down those interest rates.
[00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:53.140]   So that'll help you later as you're coaching yourself
[00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:55.940]   and trying to figure out where is my money actually held.
[00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:57.620]   Then that would help you to understand,
[00:39:57.620 --> 00:39:59.240]   that would help you to understand
[00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:01.100]   maybe where you should put more of the money.
[00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:02.400]   And you might want to move more of the money
[00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:03.600]   into the higher yielding account.
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:05.380]   So that's cash and cash equivalents.
[00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:06.460]   List those out individually.
[00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:07.760]   Number two,
[00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:09.960]   and reference the spreadsheet in today's show notes,
[00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:11.840]   which today's show notes are found at
[00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:14.980]   radicalpersonalfinance.com slash 22.
[00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:17.200]   Radicalpersonalfinance.com slash 22.
[00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:19.220]   Next would be investments.
[00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:22.340]   So here you're going to list out any investments that you have.
[00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:24.160]   So this may be stocks.
[00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:26.220]   This may be bonds.
[00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:28.420]   This may be mutual funds.
[00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:31.700]   Maybe variable annuities or fixed annuities.
[00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:34.960]   Maybe some kind of pension account.
[00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:38.520]   So a pension account would be a 401k that you have at work
[00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:40.920]   or a 403b or a 457.
[00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:42.620]   It's technically not a pension account,
[00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:44.600]   but a 457 is a deferred comp plan.
[00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:45.740]   If you have one of those.
[00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:47.180]   If you have some kind of deferred comp plan,
[00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:48.280]   it's a defined benefit pension.
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:50.340]   So maybe your employer offers you
[00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:52.360]   what we traditionally use as a pension,
[00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:54.080]   which is called a defined benefit pension,
[00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:56.640]   where they promise you a certain amount when you leave.
[00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:59.720]   Try to get some kind of present value calculation on that
[00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:03.120]   and list that in there as a pension account.
[00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:07.220]   If you have investments held in any kind of IRA or Roth IRA,
[00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:10.100]   if you have any life insurance cash values,
[00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:11.080]   I would list them here.
[00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:15.620]   If you have real estate that you own for investment purposes,
[00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:16.820]   so a real estate portfolio,
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.240]   rental properties of some kind or land
[00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:21.380]   or whatever the nature is of your real estate,
[00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:22.300]   I would list that here.
[00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:26.180]   And I would list any collectibles that you own for investment purposes.
[00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:29.660]   So maybe you invest in art or maybe you invest in coins
[00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:32.880]   or maybe you invest in antique automobiles.
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:36.140]   I would list those collectibles that are owned for investment purposes here.
[00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:39.680]   I would list any kind of maybe college savings accounts that you may have.
[00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:43.080]   Any trust accounts over which you have some control
[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:44.740]   or over which you're the beneficiary.
[00:41:44.740 --> 00:41:46.580]   Be careful listing a trust account.
[00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:49.620]   If you're the beneficiary of a trust account,
[00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:51.940]   be careful if there's some kind of major restriction.
[00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:54.880]   But it would be important to know if you're the beneficiary of a trust account
[00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:57.040]   and any business interest that you have.
[00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:59.440]   So list out any value of any business interests.
[00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:01.700]   Now, and anything else.
[00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:03.860]   Anything else that you own for investment purposes,
[00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:07.640]   list that out on this section of your statement of financial condition.
[00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:09.280]   Now, what do you value it as?
[00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:12.900]   Well, remember, a balance sheet is always a snapshot in time.
[00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:14.640]   So up at the top of the balance sheet,
[00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:16.100]   then you would list out,
[00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:16.640]   you would put this out,
[00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:17.120]   put the date.
[00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:18.480]   So today is July 17.
[00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:19.720]   So if I were preparing this,
[00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:21.680]   I would put July 17, 2014.
[00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:24.160]   And we're going to try to get the current value.
[00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:27.580]   This is easy with things like publicly traded stocks,
[00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:31.340]   mutual funds, pension account balances,
[00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:32.200]   things like that.
[00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:36.200]   If they're a defined contribution plan like a 401k or a 403b,
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:40.020]   this is easy because these things are marked to the market every day.
[00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:42.460]   And so we know exactly what the current value is.
[00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:43.940]   We know what the current market price is.
[00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:44.600]   I shouldn't say value.
[00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:45.440]   I should say market price.
[00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:46.460]   We know what the current market value is.
[00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:47.140]   We know what the current market price is.
[00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:51.220]   We know what somebody is willing to buy them from me today at a current price.
[00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:52.840]   So those are easy.
[00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:54.860]   But what about things that are harder to value?
[00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:57.720]   Well, we might have something like real estate.
[00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:00.200]   We may have real estate portfolio that changes.
[00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:03.540]   And you can't actually know the value of the real estate until the deal is done.
[00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:05.380]   Until the deal is sold, you don't know the value.
[00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:06.920]   Well, just do your best estimate.
[00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:10.220]   So if I were listing here real estate owned for investment purposes,
[00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:12.700]   this money here, I would keep a whole,
[00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:14.300]   if I were running a real estate portfolio,
[00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:15.980]   I would keep a whole separate set of financial statements,
[00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:17.120]   for my portfolio.
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:19.800]   And I would just list my current best guess.
[00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:21.660]   If I had any appraisals or things like that,
[00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:22.440]   do the best you can.
[00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:25.000]   This is with things like collectibles,
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.240]   you're going to have to do the same thing.
[00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:28.160]   Try to give yourself an honest assessment.
[00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:31.600]   There's no need to be excessively kind and inflate the balances.
[00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:34.620]   And there's no need to be excessively cruel and diminish the balances.
[00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:37.300]   Try to give yourself accurate data to work from.
[00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:40.420]   Now, if you have something like a defined benefit pension,
[00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:45.420]   you may not be able to get a current,
[00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:47.020]   current statement on this.
[00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:51.340]   Or another example would be if you were the recipient of a series of income payments.
[00:43:51.340 --> 00:43:53.480]   So maybe you had some kind of structured settlement,
[00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:56.920]   a legal settlement or a lottery payment or something like that.
[00:43:56.920 --> 00:44:01.920]   Traditionally, how we would value this would be based upon a concept
[00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:03.280]   that's called net present value.
[00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:07.440]   And so we would try to figure out what would be the total cash flow
[00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:09.540]   that would be coming out of this pension in the future,
[00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:13.620]   and the total cash flow out of the structured settlement.
[00:44:13.620 --> 00:44:16.040]   And we would back that up to today, discount it,
[00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:20.320]   down to today and try to figure out what the present value of this account is.
[00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:23.020]   Most of you are not going to have to get that complicated.
[00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:25.100]   And if you do, you probably have some sense of it.
[00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:27.700]   Sometimes you'll have if you have a pension,
[00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:29.860]   sometimes you'll have a lump sum amount.
[00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:33.100]   So this would be the amount that if I left today and I just took a lump sum,
[00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:36.780]   this would be the amount I would receive as compared to the value of my income payments.
[00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:40.360]   So if you have that, that may be the number that you that you want to put in.
[00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:42.000]   I would put some notes on here.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:45.880]   However, if you were valuing something in a way that if
[00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:49.620]   you were going to value something in a way that were was a little bit unique,
[00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:52.660]   put some notes so that you would know on a formal financial statement,
[00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:55.500]   there will always be explained on a formal business financial statement.
[00:44:55.500 --> 00:45:00.220]   There will always be explanatory notes indicating how the valuation was reached
[00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:01.120]   and what goes into it.
[00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:03.440]   Are we using gap accounting or we're using non gap accounting?
[00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:07.680]   Or what are we what are we actually what are we actually using here?
[00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:10.660]   And so put the same thing on your own personal financial statements.
[00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:12.160]   Business interests.
[00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:15.840]   The valuation of business interest is generally pretty tough.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.140]   And so maybe you've had some kind of formal valuation.
[00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:26.680]   The difficulty with business interest is that there are essentially three major ways of valuing of valuing businesses.
[00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:30.000]   And and and there are more.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.220]   But this is just the way that I think about it in my head.
[00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:33.540]   And I'll give you those real quick.
[00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:35.640]   Although I don't want to get in the weeds with business interest.
[00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:37.160]   The way to value business interest.
[00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:38.340]   Usually you're going to have three numbers.
[00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:40.320]   Your first number would be your liquidation value.
[00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:43.440]   So if you just simply said, hey, I'm going to liquidate this business.
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:44.400]   I'm done with it.
[00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:45.800]   I don't want to run it anymore.
[00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:52.140]   What value could I get for selling all of the assets of the of the company and paying off all the liabilities?
[00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:54.340]   That would be the book value of the business.
[00:45:54.340 --> 00:46:05.940]   And so the book value is usually going to be the lowest because most businesses are not really functioning based upon most businesses are not really functioning based upon, you know, the book value.
[00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:08.160]   They're using real assets to make money.
[00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:11.720]   And so their financial value is much higher than the real value, which is the book value.
[00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:14.620]   Kind of interplay between those two.
[00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:15.760]   Number two would be some sort.
[00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:17.300]   Of capitalization of income.
[00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:20.800]   And so this is the more normal accounts of various industries.
[00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:23.680]   We'll say what's the net income or what's the net profit of the company?
[00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:26.060]   And then we'll use some kind of what's called a cap rate.
[00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:28.260]   So over a certain period of years.
[00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:31.740]   So in some industries, it may be what we use five X net income.
[00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:34.620]   And so you say my business has a net income of one hundred thousand dollars.
[00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:36.260]   We're going to value to five hundred thousand dollars.
[00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:39.380]   There's some more intricate formulas that are usually a little bit more useful.
[00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:42.160]   And so that's going to be a second one.
[00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:44.300]   The third thing would just be an owner's estimate of value.
[00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:45.560]   And so basically.
[00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:47.660]   This might be how much would I pay you to.
[00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:49.640]   How much would I pay you?
[00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:52.120]   How much would you be willing to accept to walk away from the business?
[00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:53.920]   Those are the three big areas.
[00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:58.360]   Now, there are many, many, many more ways to get more in depth with it.
[00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:05.180]   And those other ways are very important to be able to get in depth and look at a formal review of your business.
[00:47:05.180 --> 00:47:07.000]   But that would just be a quick overview.
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.120]   So do the best that you can to put a business interest.
[00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:11.540]   If you've had a formal appraisal, list that out.
[00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:14.080]   If you're just kind of going with your gut, list that out.
[00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:15.680]   Now, be careful that you're not.
[00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:18.580]   overly optimistic here.
[00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:20.820]   So if I'm preparing financial statements for somebody.
[00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:22.900]   And I'll go ahead and put their business interest.
[00:47:22.900 --> 00:47:24.760]   But it may be that if we're looking.
[00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:27.060]   We're going to use this later and apply this.
[00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:30.360]   And try to prepare a retirement plan.
[00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:33.120]   I want to make sure that if the person is telling me.
[00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:35.560]   My business is currently valued at a hundred thousand dollars.
[00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:37.960]   It's going to grow at a ten percent annual rate.
[00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:39.980]   And then I'm going to sell it for five hundred thousand dollars.
[00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:40.780]   And that's going to be.
[00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:42.840]   You know, fund my retirement.
[00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:44.840]   I want to make sure that that is accurate.
[00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:46.700]   And then that is possible.
[00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:47.740]   Some businesses.
[00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:50.860]   Will lend themselves much more to this than others.
[00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:53.460]   So if you started a local landscaping company.
[00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:56.220]   Then basically the only value that you have.
[00:47:56.220 --> 00:47:58.160]   Is the value of your accounts and your equipment.
[00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:00.480]   And so can you sell those accounts to someone else?
[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:01.360]   I bet you can.
[00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:04.280]   But I bet you it's not nearly as much as you might think.
[00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:05.260]   I've never worked in that.
[00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:07.020]   I had a couple of clients in that business.
[00:48:07.020 --> 00:48:09.700]   But you could probably sell your accounts to another landscaper.
[00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:12.140]   But might not be so valuable.
[00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:15.140]   Now, on the other hand, if you have some really valuable intellectual property.
[00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:18.280]   You've built up a business that doesn't depend on your own.
[00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:19.760]   On your own.
[00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:21.280]   Involvement in it.
[00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:24.160]   You've built a business that essentially just simply prints money for you.
[00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:26.560]   Without with minimal involvement for you.
[00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:28.620]   That would be a very different value.
[00:48:28.620 --> 00:48:32.200]   So one of the things when we're looking at how to optimize our investment returns.
[00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:33.960]   We want to give a high degree of focus.
[00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:37.800]   To how do we enhance the value of our business from a sales perspective.
[00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:41.920]   And this is usually one of the areas that entrepreneurs can really make a big difference.
[00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:43.780]   By systematizing their business.
[00:48:43.780 --> 00:48:45.560]   Making sure that they're not dependent on.
[00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:46.960]   Any one specific employee.
[00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:49.620]   Maybe making sure that they've got systems in place.
[00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:50.680]   And it's well documented.
[00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:53.900]   Making sure that they're enhancing the book value in every way they can.
[00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:55.860]   Making sure that they're enhancing the valuations.
[00:48:55.860 --> 00:49:00.700]   So at some point I'll try to get an accountant on the line.
[00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:03.480]   For an interview who specializes in business valuation.
[00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:06.680]   And we'll talk about some of the strategies that you can put in place.
[00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:09.740]   To the strategies that you can put in place.
[00:49:09.740 --> 00:49:12.320]   To enhance the value of.
[00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:14.780]   Enhance the value of your company.
[00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:15.360]   So.
[00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:17.000]   You would list out the value of your investments.
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:18.540]   Third category.
[00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:20.680]   Use assets.
[00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:23.220]   So use assets would be anything that you use.
[00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:24.700]   This is stuff that you own.
[00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:26.020]   That's for your personal enjoyment.
[00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:27.060]   For your personal use.
[00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:27.660]   Obvious one.
[00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:28.380]   Do you own a house?
[00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:30.120]   That's a use asset.
[00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:32.640]   So your house is not an investment.
[00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:34.760]   Your house is a use asset.
[00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:36.820]   Your house is not an investment.
[00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:38.520]   Your house is a use asset.
[00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:42.140]   Now you may be able to transform that use asset.
[00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:44.080]   Into a better investment in some way.
[00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:44.820]   And enhance that.
[00:49:44.820 --> 00:49:45.360]   But.
[00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:45.860]   I'll say it again.
[00:49:45.860 --> 00:49:46.980]   Your house is not an investment.
[00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:48.420]   I'm going to hammer this point for a moment.
[00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:51.400]   The reason I say your house is not an investment.
[00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:54.840]   Even though it may be one of your highest dollar value assets.
[00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:57.340]   Is because investments should make you money.
[00:49:57.340 --> 00:49:58.540]   And your house doesn't.
[00:49:58.540 --> 00:50:00.040]   It sucks money out of your budget.
[00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:02.540]   And if you say well my house is going to go up in value.
[00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:02.740]   Yeah.
[00:50:02.740 --> 00:50:03.480]   But you're right.
[00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:05.280]   But you know what would help it do even better?
[00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:07.720]   Is if it printed money for you while it was going up in value.
[00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:08.920]   If you rented it out.
[00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:11.020]   Now it doesn't mean you shouldn't buy a house.
[00:50:11.020 --> 00:50:13.020]   But just don't think of your house as an investment.
[00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:15.100]   Think of your house as a use asset.
[00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:17.960]   This is something that is a lifestyle expense.
[00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:19.700]   That you are choosing to enjoy.
[00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:21.400]   And there's nothing wrong with that.
[00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:21.920]   It's your money.
[00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:23.180]   You can't take it with you when you go.
[00:50:23.180 --> 00:50:24.960]   You might as well spend it on what's important to you.
[00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:26.860]   So if you want to have a big fancy house.
[00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:27.480]   Awesome.
[00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:28.200]   Go for it.
[00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:30.340]   If you want to have a small inexpensive house.
[00:50:30.340 --> 00:50:30.820]   Awesome.
[00:50:30.820 --> 00:50:31.460]   Go for it.
[00:50:31.460 --> 00:50:32.920]   Your house is a use asset.
[00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:35.820]   Look for a way to enhance the value of it.
[00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:37.080]   So while you're there.
[00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:37.780]   Is there some way.
[00:50:37.780 --> 00:50:38.780]   Can you buy smart?
[00:50:38.780 --> 00:50:43.320]   Can you choose a good location with an above average chance of appreciation?
[00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:44.620]   Do you know the neighborhood?
[00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:49.240]   That is in more of a demand than other neighborhoods in your city.
[00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:51.180]   So that you're able to.
[00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:55.560]   So that you're really able to build up the value in the long term.
[00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:55.880]   Yes.
[00:50:55.880 --> 00:50:57.460]   Can you enhance the value of your house?
[00:50:57.460 --> 00:50:57.800]   Yes.
[00:50:57.800 --> 00:51:00.600]   But you're never going to get a dollar for dollar situation.
[00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:02.320]   Don't look and say if I put a swimming pool.
[00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:03.800]   It's going to increase the value of my house.
[00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:06.020]   By this massive investment return.
[00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:07.640]   In my observation.
[00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:09.020]   And limited experience.
[00:51:09.020 --> 00:51:10.380]   And conversations with others.
[00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:11.980]   I would say it's never going to do that.
[00:51:11.980 --> 00:51:13.620]   Put in a swimming pool.
[00:51:13.620 --> 00:51:14.740]   Because you want to own a swimming pool.
[00:51:14.740 --> 00:51:15.120]   And you're willing.
[00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:15.760]   To pay for it.
[00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:17.660]   And then maybe will it sell for a little bit more?
[00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:18.100]   It might.
[00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:19.340]   Or it might be a liability.
[00:51:19.340 --> 00:51:20.300]   Depending on how it is.
[00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:21.740]   So rant finished.
[00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:23.180]   But your house is a use asset.
[00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:24.420]   Number two would be.
[00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:25.900]   Do you own a vacation home?
[00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:26.600]   A condo?
[00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:30.460]   Another type of.
[00:51:30.460 --> 00:51:30.800]   I don't know.
[00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:31.400]   Vacation property.
[00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:32.520]   I was thinking about hotel clubs.
[00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:33.180]   Or timeshares.
[00:51:33.180 --> 00:51:34.320]   But it seems.
[00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:35.540]   I've never owned one.
[00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:36.140]   Never planned to.
[00:51:36.140 --> 00:51:38.060]   It seems like those are usually more liabilities.
[00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:38.800]   Than anything else.
[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:39.640]   It seems like.
[00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:41.900]   I never hear about anyone actually being able to get out of one.
[00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:43.020]   So I wouldn't list that as an asset.
[00:51:43.020 --> 00:51:44.320]   I'd probably list it as a liability.
[00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:46.660]   I didn't think about that before the show.
[00:51:46.660 --> 00:51:47.600]   Automobiles.
[00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:48.540]   Do you own any automobiles?
[00:51:48.540 --> 00:51:49.780]   Or other personal property?
[00:51:49.780 --> 00:51:50.620]   Do you own a ski boat?
[00:51:50.620 --> 00:51:51.280]   A fishing boat?
[00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:52.420]   Do you own an RV?
[00:51:52.420 --> 00:51:53.960]   Do you own a motorcycle?
[00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:55.000]   Do you own a go-kart?
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.060]   Do you own a fancy bicycle?
[00:51:57.060 --> 00:51:59.580]   Any kind of personal property.
[00:51:59.580 --> 00:52:01.440]   List and value out your personal property.
[00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:02.140]   Now.
[00:52:02.140 --> 00:52:05.560]   I think it is important to list out personal property.
[00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:06.540]   But.
[00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:09.460]   I would be careful about what I listed here.
[00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:12.320]   As far as it having any chance of going up in value.
[00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:13.100]   So.
[00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:14.300]   If you had.
[00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:16.320]   The example that comes to mind.
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:17.200]   Is if I had.
[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:18.180]   A computer.
[00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:19.200]   Let's just say I went down.
[00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:20.340]   I bought a new Dell laptop.
[00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:21.740]   I might.
[00:52:21.740 --> 00:52:24.340]   Or might not list that as personal property.
[00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:27.320]   And you could maintain two sets of personal property.
[00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:28.460]   It would be valuable.
[00:52:28.460 --> 00:52:29.760]   It would be valuable.
[00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:30.900]   To have a record.
[00:52:30.900 --> 00:52:32.600]   A schedule of your personal property.
[00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:34.940]   For the purpose of insurance reimbursement.
[00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:36.260]   If you had renter's insurance.
[00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:37.260]   Or homeowner's insurance.
[00:52:37.260 --> 00:52:38.480]   It would be good to have a record of it.
[00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:39.560]   But on this statement.
[00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:40.880]   If I were your financial planner.
[00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:41.180]   I would say.
[00:52:41.180 --> 00:52:42.360]   Get the computer off of there.
[00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:42.820]   Now.
[00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:43.280]   On the other hand.
[00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:44.320]   If you've got something like.
[00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:46.500]   A valuable gun collection.
[00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:48.980]   A valuable collection of jewels.
[00:52:48.980 --> 00:52:49.400]   Jewelry.
[00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:51.440]   I think people usually overstate the value of it.
[00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:52.560]   But there is value there.
[00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:54.560]   But something like a gun collection.
[00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:54.900]   I mean.
[00:52:54.900 --> 00:52:56.720]   If you were to buy a.
[00:52:56.720 --> 00:52:58.340]   A Colt 1911.
[00:52:58.340 --> 00:52:58.820]   Bought.
[00:52:58.820 --> 00:53:00.160]   Purchased in 1950.
[00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:02.040]   And a Colt 1911 today.
[00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:03.520]   If you adjust that for inflation.
[00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:05.300]   That's pretty much going to keep pace with inflation.
[00:53:05.300 --> 00:53:05.640]   So.
[00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:07.320]   So I wouldn't put things in here.
[00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:08.640]   That are going to go down in value.
[00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:10.020]   But you might list something.
[00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:11.680]   That you think is going to go up in value.
[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:12.480]   And.
[00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:14.340]   That's kind of a judgment call.
[00:53:14.340 --> 00:53:14.960]   Depending on what.
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:15.360]   You've got.
[00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:15.940]   So.
[00:53:15.940 --> 00:53:16.660]   Just be careful.
[00:53:16.660 --> 00:53:17.400]   With what you list there.
[00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:17.760]   And list.
[00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:18.300]   List it out.
[00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:18.460]   Hey.
[00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:19.180]   If you want to list it there.
[00:53:19.180 --> 00:53:19.420]   Great.
[00:53:19.420 --> 00:53:20.000]   And then.
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.180]   If I were creating a forward looking financial plan.
[00:53:22.180 --> 00:53:23.260]   We would just go through.
[00:53:23.260 --> 00:53:24.520]   And put in the rates of return.
[00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:25.720]   And the rates of depreciation.
[00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:26.500]   And then.
[00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:27.280]   Any collectibles.
[00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:27.820]   That you own.
[00:53:27.820 --> 00:53:28.800]   For personal enjoyment.
[00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:30.500]   So maybe you own.
[00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:31.120]   A.
[00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:33.240]   Some sort of collection of.
[00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:34.820]   I don't know.
[00:53:34.820 --> 00:53:35.400]   Personal.
[00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:36.300]   Classic cars.
[00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:36.900]   This would be listed.
[00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:37.540]   Or automobiles.
[00:53:37.540 --> 00:53:38.780]   But do you own any other collectibles?
[00:53:38.780 --> 00:53:39.460]   Do you own art.
[00:53:39.460 --> 00:53:41.000]   That's just purely for personal enjoyment.
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:42.260]   Not for investment purposes.
[00:53:42.260 --> 00:53:44.040]   Or any other use assets.
[00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:44.940]   List all those things.
[00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:45.160]   Out.
[00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:46.100]   And at the end of that.
[00:53:46.100 --> 00:53:46.760]   You will find.
[00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:47.680]   Your total assets.
[00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:49.760]   And if you list out that.
[00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:50.780]   You'll have your total assets.
[00:53:50.780 --> 00:53:51.640]   And so that tells you.
[00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:52.260]   How much.
[00:53:52.260 --> 00:53:53.320]   Total assets.
[00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:53.740]   Do you have.
[00:53:53.740 --> 00:53:54.560]   Financial assets.
[00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:56.580]   Liabilities.
[00:53:56.580 --> 00:53:57.720]   Let me boogie through liabilities.
[00:53:57.720 --> 00:53:58.380]   Liabilities.
[00:53:58.380 --> 00:54:00.080]   Do you have any credit card balances.
[00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:01.280]   Any auto loans.
[00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:02.080]   Personal loans.
[00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:02.780]   Student loans.
[00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:03.540]   Mortgage loans.
[00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:04.400]   Business loans.
[00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:05.580]   Things like that.
[00:54:05.580 --> 00:54:06.340]   As far as.
[00:54:06.340 --> 00:54:06.880]   How to account.
[00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:07.860]   For the value of a business.
[00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:09.000]   Versus the business loan.
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:09.700]   Me personally.
[00:54:09.700 --> 00:54:10.700]   I would keep a separate.
[00:54:10.700 --> 00:54:12.500]   I would keep a separate set.
[00:54:12.500 --> 00:54:14.320]   Of business financial statements.
[00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:15.640]   And so I would.
[00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:16.080]   I would.
[00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:17.060]   Declare the assets.
[00:54:17.060 --> 00:54:17.600]   Of the business.
[00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:18.180]   Minus the.
[00:54:18.180 --> 00:54:19.320]   The loans of the business.
[00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:20.520]   The debts of the business.
[00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:22.120]   And then that would equal.
[00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:22.960]   The business interest.
[00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:23.780]   That I would bring over.
[00:54:23.780 --> 00:54:25.360]   Onto my personal balance statement.
[00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:26.120]   However.
[00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:26.980]   You might make a note.
[00:54:26.980 --> 00:54:27.740]   With an asterisk.
[00:54:27.740 --> 00:54:29.040]   If you're personally on the hook.
[00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:30.580]   For those business loans.
[00:54:30.580 --> 00:54:32.060]   And if those are recourse loans.
[00:54:32.060 --> 00:54:33.180]   Which is more common.
[00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:34.060]   In today's world.
[00:54:34.060 --> 00:54:35.240]   With small businesses.
[00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:35.820]   In this country.
[00:54:35.820 --> 00:54:36.940]   If those are recourse loans.
[00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:37.600]   Meaning the business.
[00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:39.020]   The lender can come after you.
[00:54:39.020 --> 00:54:40.000]   If your business defaults.
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:40.400]   On the business.
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:41.140]   They can come after you.
[00:54:41.140 --> 00:54:41.540]   Personally.
[00:54:41.540 --> 00:54:42.880]   It'd be good to have a note.
[00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:43.440]   Of those here.
[00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:44.420]   And we would figure out.
[00:54:44.420 --> 00:54:45.560]   Where to account for those.
[00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:46.620]   Whether on the business statements.
[00:54:46.620 --> 00:54:47.680]   Or on the personal statements.
[00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:49.200]   And depending on the situation.
[00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:50.240]   We would account for it separately.
[00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:52.100]   If you'll do those liabilities.
[00:54:52.100 --> 00:54:52.800]   And you'll see how.
[00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:53.640]   I've laid this out.
[00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:54.360]   In the.
[00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:55.520]   In the spreadsheet.
[00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:56.700]   You'll have your assets.
[00:54:56.700 --> 00:54:57.780]   Minus your liabilities.
[00:54:57.780 --> 00:54:58.700]   Equals your net worth.
[00:54:58.700 --> 00:54:59.500]   And so there's a net worth.
[00:54:59.500 --> 00:55:00.080]   Column there.
[00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:01.080]   And then at the bottom.
[00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:01.840]   Just for a little.
[00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:02.900]   Accounting convention.
[00:55:02.900 --> 00:55:04.380]   We total your liabilities.
[00:55:04.380 --> 00:55:05.180]   And your net worth.
[00:55:05.180 --> 00:55:06.340]   So that.
[00:55:06.340 --> 00:55:07.540]   To complete the.
[00:55:07.540 --> 00:55:08.360]   Accounting statement.
[00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:09.520]   Liabilities and net worth.
[00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:11.000]   And then that should equal.
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:11.900]   Total assets.
[00:55:11.900 --> 00:55:13.360]   If you would like to use.
[00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:13.820]   My.
[00:55:13.820 --> 00:55:16.040]   Spreadsheet that I've illustrated.
[00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:17.760]   Remember to put your assets on.
[00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:19.160]   Using a positive dollar figure.
[00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:20.500]   And your liabilities on.
[00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:21.740]   Putting a negative dollar figure.
[00:55:21.740 --> 00:55:23.140]   And that will make the formulas work.
[00:55:23.140 --> 00:55:24.560]   If you don't want to do that.
[00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:25.520]   Or if you forget to do that.
[00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:26.440]   Adjust the formulas.
[00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:27.760]   But if you're just going to use.
[00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:28.380]   My formulas.
[00:55:28.380 --> 00:55:29.540]   Then use a positive.
[00:55:29.540 --> 00:55:30.340]   And a negative.
[00:55:30.340 --> 00:55:31.680]   And so down at the bottom.
[00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:32.560]   Of your.
[00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:33.680]   Statement.
[00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:35.640]   Just like over on the business side.
[00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:36.420]   You have your.
[00:55:36.420 --> 00:55:37.080]   Assets.
[00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:38.440]   In the business financial statements.
[00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:38.820]   You have.
[00:55:38.820 --> 00:55:40.460]   Assets equals liabilities.
[00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:41.860]   Plus your stockholders equity.
[00:55:41.860 --> 00:55:43.440]   Here on your.
[00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:44.420]   Personal statements.
[00:55:44.420 --> 00:55:45.220]   You have your assets.
[00:55:45.220 --> 00:55:46.160]   Equals your liabilities.
[00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:47.180]   Plus your net worth.
[00:55:47.180 --> 00:55:48.700]   And so this would be the personal way.
[00:55:48.700 --> 00:55:50.460]   To adapt the business accounting convention.
[00:55:50.460 --> 00:55:52.000]   Over to your personal statements.
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:53.920]   So if you will create this.
[00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:54.640]   And.
[00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:55.440]   And you just.
[00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:56.960]   What's the point of creating this.
[00:55:56.960 --> 00:55:57.580]   If you'll create this.
[00:55:57.580 --> 00:55:57.960]   Number one.
[00:55:57.960 --> 00:55:58.740]   You'll have information.
[00:55:58.740 --> 00:55:59.800]   And.
[00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:01.800]   Usually this will help you a lot.
[00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:03.700]   Many times when people are in financial distress.
[00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:04.780]   They're usually.
[00:56:04.780 --> 00:56:06.040]   They're often ignoring.
[00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:06.980]   The.
[00:56:06.980 --> 00:56:07.720]   The.
[00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:08.460]   The situation.
[00:56:08.460 --> 00:56:09.340]   They're often just sitting.
[00:56:09.340 --> 00:56:09.560]   Trying.
[00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:10.580]   They're trying to ignore.
[00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:11.740]   What people are.
[00:56:11.740 --> 00:56:13.020]   You know.
[00:56:13.020 --> 00:56:13.300]   Ignore.
[00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:13.700]   What they are.
[00:56:13.700 --> 00:56:14.340]   Ignore the bills.
[00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:15.180]   That doesn't help you.
[00:56:15.180 --> 00:56:16.000]   Now.
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:16.880]   I understand it.
[00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:17.100]   It's.
[00:56:17.100 --> 00:56:18.440]   It's easy to want to crawl into bed.
[00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:19.440]   Pull the covers over your head.
[00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:19.720]   And just.
[00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:20.560]   Give up.
[00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:21.740]   But that doesn't help you.
[00:56:21.740 --> 00:56:22.820]   Because whether you ignore it or not.
[00:56:22.820 --> 00:56:23.380]   It's still there.
[00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:24.840]   So you might as well address it.
[00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:26.000]   And if you need to wait a day or two.
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:26.240]   And.
[00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:26.540]   And.
[00:56:26.540 --> 00:56:27.260]   I don't know.
[00:56:27.260 --> 00:56:28.740]   Do with this.
[00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:29.600]   With a glass of wine.
[00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:30.080]   And a cigar.
[00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:31.140]   So you're a little bit relaxed.
[00:56:31.140 --> 00:56:31.640]   And then.
[00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:32.660]   Make these things up.
[00:56:32.660 --> 00:56:33.120]   That's fine.
[00:56:33.120 --> 00:56:33.660]   But face your.
[00:56:33.660 --> 00:56:34.140]   Face your.
[00:56:34.140 --> 00:56:35.520]   Face the situation.
[00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:36.360]   Face the facts.
[00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:37.380]   Because it.
[00:56:37.380 --> 00:56:38.480]   It's always feel better.
[00:56:38.580 --> 00:56:39.860]   It feels better to face the facts.
[00:56:39.860 --> 00:56:41.780]   Especially if you're in a crisis situation.
[00:56:41.780 --> 00:56:42.820]   Face the facts.
[00:56:42.820 --> 00:56:44.160]   Because then you have a hope of solving them.
[00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:45.220]   If you don't face the facts.
[00:56:45.220 --> 00:56:46.380]   You have no hope of solving them.
[00:56:46.380 --> 00:56:47.280]   So.
[00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:48.660]   If you look at this.
[00:56:48.660 --> 00:56:50.840]   You can gain a lot of valuable information from it.
[00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:52.520]   One note that I like to do.
[00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:53.520]   And this would be more.
[00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:54.900]   When I move over to financial planning.
[00:56:54.900 --> 00:56:56.300]   But with my personal financial statements.
[00:56:56.300 --> 00:56:57.060]   I would.
[00:56:57.060 --> 00:56:57.400]   And.
[00:56:57.400 --> 00:56:59.180]   I would like to put an estimated.
[00:56:59.180 --> 00:57:00.760]   Return value.
[00:57:00.760 --> 00:57:03.220]   Now this is not something that I would count on.
[00:57:03.220 --> 00:57:04.960]   But I would put an estimated return value.
[00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:06.340]   So I would add.
[00:57:06.340 --> 00:57:07.080]   Another column.
[00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:08.060]   Column.
[00:57:08.060 --> 00:57:08.460]   Or a.
[00:57:08.540 --> 00:57:08.780]   Note.
[00:57:08.780 --> 00:57:09.340]   To this.
[00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:09.620]   And say.
[00:57:09.620 --> 00:57:09.840]   Okay.
[00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:10.280]   Cash.
[00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:12.040]   What's the estimated return of my cash?
[00:57:12.040 --> 00:57:12.640]   Well traditionally.
[00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:13.260]   It should be.
[00:57:13.260 --> 00:57:14.420]   Four or five percent.
[00:57:14.420 --> 00:57:15.140]   If we were in.
[00:57:15.140 --> 00:57:16.380]   Kind of the more mainstream.
[00:57:16.380 --> 00:57:17.440]   Normal.
[00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:18.400]   Environments.
[00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:19.360]   That seems to have been.
[00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:21.140]   That over the past.
[00:57:21.140 --> 00:57:21.640]   Over history.
[00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:23.460]   The regression to the mean.
[00:57:23.460 --> 00:57:24.580]   Of what you would earn on cash.
[00:57:24.580 --> 00:57:24.900]   Would be.
[00:57:24.900 --> 00:57:26.260]   Three to five percent.
[00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:26.780]   That would be.
[00:57:26.780 --> 00:57:28.220]   A more normal situation.
[00:57:28.220 --> 00:57:29.180]   And today.
[00:57:29.180 --> 00:57:29.900]   And who knows.
[00:57:29.900 --> 00:57:30.860]   If this is a new normal.
[00:57:30.860 --> 00:57:32.420]   Or this is just an anomaly.
[00:57:32.420 --> 00:57:32.960]   I don't know.
[00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:34.080]   But today it would seem.
[00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:35.340]   You output a half a percent.
[00:57:35.340 --> 00:57:36.220]   I mean.
[00:57:36.220 --> 00:57:37.080]   You show me an account.
[00:57:37.080 --> 00:57:37.740]   That's paying any.
[00:57:37.740 --> 00:57:38.500]   Any amount of money.
[00:57:38.620 --> 00:57:39.640]   That's worth having in it.
[00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:40.000]   And it's.
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:41.100]   It makes a dramatic difference.
[00:57:41.100 --> 00:57:42.000]   There's not much.
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:43.220]   If I were valuing.
[00:57:43.220 --> 00:57:43.980]   A stock portfolio.
[00:57:43.980 --> 00:57:44.500]   Or bonds.
[00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:45.200]   If you have.
[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:46.520]   Individual bond investments.
[00:57:46.520 --> 00:57:47.120]   Then go ahead.
[00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:47.600]   And value.
[00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:48.980]   If those are individual bonds.
[00:57:48.980 --> 00:57:49.440]   That you own.
[00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:49.860]   That you're planning.
[00:57:49.860 --> 00:57:50.640]   To hold to maturity.
[00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:51.340]   Go ahead.
[00:57:51.340 --> 00:57:52.400]   And put their yield in there.
[00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:53.040]   What you're expecting.
[00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:53.920]   Their yield to be.
[00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:54.900]   If you have a bond.
[00:57:54.900 --> 00:57:55.500]   Mutual fund.
[00:57:55.500 --> 00:57:56.280]   You'll have to estimate.
[00:57:56.280 --> 00:57:56.880]   That yield.
[00:57:56.880 --> 00:57:57.480]   Because a bond.
[00:57:57.480 --> 00:57:58.120]   Mutual fund.
[00:57:58.120 --> 00:57:59.700]   Would have an unlimited duration.
[00:57:59.700 --> 00:58:00.300]   And so.
[00:58:00.300 --> 00:58:00.920]   You would have to.
[00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:02.060]   Figure that out.
[00:58:02.060 --> 00:58:02.920]   And kind of adjust.
[00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:03.480]   How sensitive.
[00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:04.860]   This is to interest rates.
[00:58:05.260 --> 00:58:06.380]   If you had mutual funds.
[00:58:06.380 --> 00:58:07.480]   Estimate something.
[00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:08.260]   Maybe you could go.
[00:58:08.260 --> 00:58:09.500]   And look at the.
[00:58:09.500 --> 00:58:11.140]   Look at the.
[00:58:11.140 --> 00:58:12.400]   Lifetime return of the fund.
[00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:13.820]   And estimate that.
[00:58:13.820 --> 00:58:14.620]   Maybe.
[00:58:14.620 --> 00:58:15.520]   Same thing.
[00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:16.000]   With if you had.
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:16.800]   Variable annuities.
[00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:17.740]   If you have a fixed annuity.
[00:58:17.740 --> 00:58:18.300]   Put in there.
[00:58:18.300 --> 00:58:19.560]   The interest rate.
[00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:20.900]   That you were being paid.
[00:58:20.900 --> 00:58:21.780]   On your fixed annuity.
[00:58:21.780 --> 00:58:23.060]   Look at the investments.
[00:58:23.060 --> 00:58:24.440]   Look at your life insurance.
[00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:25.180]   Cash values.
[00:58:25.180 --> 00:58:26.300]   And try to estimate.
[00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:27.520]   What a historical return.
[00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:28.380]   Would be on a policy.
[00:58:28.380 --> 00:58:28.900]   That's structured.
[00:58:28.900 --> 00:58:29.780]   Similar to yours.
[00:58:29.780 --> 00:58:30.320]   With the company.
[00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:30.900]   That you have.
[00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:32.600]   Look at any real estate.
[00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:33.080]   That you own.
[00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:34.000]   Try to figure out.
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:35.140]   What's your estimated return.
[00:58:35.220 --> 00:58:35.560]   Would be.
[00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:37.340]   And be conservative.
[00:58:37.340 --> 00:58:38.740]   But try to figure that out.
[00:58:38.740 --> 00:58:39.680]   And then.
[00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:40.100]   You know.
[00:58:40.100 --> 00:58:40.720]   Your business.
[00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:41.360]   Same thing.
[00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:42.620]   Value.
[00:58:42.620 --> 00:58:43.960]   Any use assets.
[00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:44.440]   That you have.
[00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:45.160]   So for example.
[00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:46.000]   The automobiles.
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:47.980]   I always would depreciate those.
[00:58:47.980 --> 00:58:49.300]   At about 15 percent per year.
[00:58:49.300 --> 00:58:50.120]   Unless there's some other.
[00:58:50.120 --> 00:58:51.080]   Extenuating factor.
[00:58:51.080 --> 00:58:52.460]   That you know of.
[00:58:52.460 --> 00:58:53.240]   That would lead to.
[00:58:53.240 --> 00:58:54.640]   A smaller depreciation rate.
[00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:55.380]   I would write.
[00:58:55.380 --> 00:58:56.500]   Minus 15 percent.
[00:58:56.500 --> 00:58:57.240]   In automobiles.
[00:58:57.240 --> 00:58:58.220]   Or if I own.
[00:58:58.220 --> 00:58:59.120]   Personal property.
[00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:00.340]   That was furniture.
[00:59:00.340 --> 00:59:01.040]   That wasn't.
[00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:02.080]   High dollar furniture.
[00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:03.420]   Or furniture.
[00:59:03.420 --> 00:59:04.220]   That had any chance.
[00:59:04.220 --> 00:59:04.880]   Of appreciating.
[00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:05.060]   Or.
[00:59:05.180 --> 00:59:05.960]   Keeping pace.
[00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:06.620]   With inflation.
[00:59:06.620 --> 00:59:07.860]   Then I would put.
[00:59:07.860 --> 00:59:08.560]   I would.
[00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:09.780]   I would put a negative number.
[00:59:09.780 --> 00:59:10.300]   Next to that.
[00:59:10.300 --> 00:59:11.720]   Now when you sit back.
[00:59:11.720 --> 00:59:12.500]   And you look at that.
[00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:13.640]   And you look at your numbers.
[00:59:13.640 --> 00:59:15.340]   You can get a pretty clear idea.
[00:59:15.340 --> 00:59:17.520]   Of where your priorities are.
[00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:19.040]   So if you are poor.
[00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:19.880]   Or broke.
[00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:21.220]   Or have always been poor.
[00:59:21.220 --> 00:59:21.760]   Or broke.
[00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:22.780]   Then probably.
[00:59:22.780 --> 00:59:24.160]   If you create this document.
[00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:25.420]   You'll probably see.
[00:59:25.420 --> 00:59:26.540]   That any money.
[00:59:26.540 --> 00:59:27.420]   That you have.
[00:59:27.420 --> 00:59:28.700]   Is likely over.
[00:59:28.700 --> 00:59:30.020]   In the use assets.
[00:59:30.020 --> 00:59:32.400]   Or it's likely over.
[00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:33.160]   In the liabilities.
[00:59:33.160 --> 00:59:34.240]   Now you say.
[00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:34.940]   Well duh Joshua.
[00:59:34.940 --> 00:59:35.160]   I know.
[00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:35.440]   I know that.
[00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:35.900]   I get that.
[00:59:35.900 --> 00:59:36.240]   I'm poor.
[00:59:36.240 --> 00:59:37.200]   Or I'm broke.
[00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:38.560]   And what the difference is.
[00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:38.880]   I don't know.
[00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:39.680]   I've heard people talk about it.
[00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:40.360]   I'll use broke.
[00:59:40.360 --> 00:59:41.920]   It's less of a value.
[00:59:41.920 --> 00:59:42.540]   Judgment.
[00:59:42.540 --> 00:59:43.900]   And more of just simply a fact.
[00:59:43.900 --> 00:59:44.420]   A fact.
[00:59:44.420 --> 00:59:45.560]   I have been broke many times.
[00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:46.920]   And who knows.
[00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:47.760]   I hope I won't be again.
[00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:48.240]   In the future.
[00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:49.500]   I keep trying to avoid it.
[00:59:49.500 --> 00:59:50.960]   But I've done some dumb stuff.
[00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:51.580]   And been broke.
[00:59:51.580 --> 00:59:52.320]   At the different times.
[00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:52.980]   Nothing wrong with it.
[00:59:52.980 --> 00:59:53.660]   Most people have.
[00:59:53.660 --> 00:59:55.100]   I read a statistic.
[00:59:55.100 --> 00:59:56.040]   This is not confirmed.
[00:59:56.040 --> 00:59:57.480]   But I hope I defined it.
[00:59:57.480 --> 00:59:58.620]   The average millionaire.
[00:59:58.620 --> 00:59:59.160]   You know.
[00:59:59.160 --> 00:59:59.580]   Was broke.
[00:59:59.580 --> 00:59:59.940]   Or bankrupt.
[00:59:59.940 --> 01:00:00.760]   A couple of times.
[01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:01.420]   Before they.
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:02.840]   Finally became.
[01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:04.100]   A million.
[01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:04.740]   A millionaire.
[01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:06.040]   I'll have to find that statistic.
[01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:07.000]   I don't know where that came from.
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.880]   If you look at this.
[01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:10.120]   You'll see where your priorities are.
[01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:11.320]   So if you're somebody.
[01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:13.040]   Who values a high lifestyle.
[01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:14.280]   What you may see.
[01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:15.180]   And I see this a lot here.
[01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:15.820]   In South Florida.
[01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:16.220]   If I.
[01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:17.560]   And my joke is to go to Miami.
[01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:18.800]   There are some very wealthy people.
[01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:19.200]   In Miami.
[01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:19.740]   But it seems.
[01:00:19.740 --> 01:00:20.600]   If you go down to Miami.
[01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:21.740]   You will see people.
[01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:24.060]   That have these incredibly expensive cars.
[01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:25.460]   And they live in a mobile home.
[01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:27.340]   And so you'll look at car.
[01:00:27.340 --> 01:00:28.720]   Worth $85,000.
[01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:30.700]   House rent.
[01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:31.080]   You know.
[01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:31.840]   Or.
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:32.220]   Or house.
[01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:32.740]   Mobile home.
[01:00:32.740 --> 01:00:33.800]   Worth $15,000.
[01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:34.900]   And that mobile home.
[01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:36.100]   May keep value.
[01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:37.180]   Or depreciate slowly.
[01:00:37.180 --> 01:00:37.780]   Over time.
[01:00:37.780 --> 01:00:38.460]   Instead of being.
[01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:38.940]   You know.
[01:00:38.940 --> 01:00:39.580]   Some sort of.
[01:00:39.580 --> 01:00:40.400]   Real estate.
[01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:40.980]   That's.
[01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:42.100]   That's likely to go up.
[01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:42.740]   So.
[01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:43.540]   So.
[01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:45.020]   At least keep pace with inflation.
[01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:46.760]   So look at the value.
[01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:47.180]   At the money.
[01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:47.780]   The amount of money.
[01:00:47.780 --> 01:00:49.080]   That you have in use assets.
[01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:50.320]   Versus business assets.
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:50.740]   And.
[01:00:50.740 --> 01:00:51.800]   Versus investments.
[01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:52.140]   I mean.
[01:00:52.140 --> 01:00:53.420]   Wealthy people.
[01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:54.920]   Would generally place the priority.
[01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:55.760]   On their investments.
[01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:56.680]   So.
[01:00:56.680 --> 01:00:58.320]   Over and above use assets.
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:00:59.800]   Or before use assets.
[01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:01.420]   They'll prioritize investments.
[01:01:01.420 --> 01:01:04.560]   Savings and investments.
[01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:05.400]   So.
[01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:05.940]   You may.
[01:01:05.940 --> 01:01:06.540]   You want to see.
[01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:07.540]   Some healthy numbers.
[01:01:07.540 --> 01:01:08.540]   In the investment column.
[01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:09.340]   You want to see.
[01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:10.240]   Some smaller numbers.
[01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:11.320]   In the liability column.
[01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:12.440]   And you want to see.
[01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:13.080]   Some big.
[01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:13.380]   You know.
[01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:14.220]   Some smaller numbers.
[01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:15.100]   In the use assets.
[01:01:15.100 --> 01:01:16.640]   Until those investment assets.
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:17.900]   Are funding the use assets.
[01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:18.620]   That's.
[01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:19.180]   To me.
[01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:20.460]   My definition of wealth.
[01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:21.380]   Is that your investments.
[01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:22.700]   Will pay for your lifestyle.
[01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:24.280]   That's how I think about wealth.
[01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:25.380]   Whatever that lifestyle is.
[01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:25.860]   And whatever those.
[01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:27.100]   Whatever those investments are.
[01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:27.640]   So.
[01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:28.640]   The only way you get there.
[01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:30.040]   Is by prioritizing.
[01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:30.720]   Money.
[01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:31.400]   From your cash.
[01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:32.120]   Flow statement.
[01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:33.020]   Which will be in a further.
[01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:33.940]   In another episode.
[01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:34.400]   Or.
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:35.460]   I'll just say your budget.
[01:01:35.460 --> 01:01:36.480]   Out of your monthly income.
[01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:37.040]   And expenses.
[01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:38.080]   Prioritizing.
[01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:38.760]   Putting money over.
[01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:39.540]   To those investments.
[01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:40.380]   And then.
[01:01:40.380 --> 01:01:41.120]   What category.
[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:42.360]   That we're putting money into.
[01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:43.680]   Is going to determine.
[01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:44.200]   So.
[01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:45.060]   You may have.
[01:01:45.060 --> 01:01:46.820]   A very large business interest.
[01:01:46.820 --> 01:01:48.320]   In a very small stock portfolio.
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:49.240]   Nothing wrong with that.
[01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:49.720]   Or you may have.
[01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:50.880]   A very large stock portfolio.
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:52.580]   And a very small business interest.
[01:01:52.580 --> 01:01:53.700]   And a lot of times.
[01:01:53.700 --> 01:01:54.700]   What you'll usually have.
[01:01:54.700 --> 01:01:55.560]   Is you'll have an interplay.
[01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:56.360]   Between these things.
[01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:58.300]   The perfect owner of stocks.
[01:01:58.300 --> 01:01:59.400]   Is someone.
[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:00.460]   Who is.
[01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:02.060]   Transitioning out of a personally.
[01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:03.080]   Closely held business.
[01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:04.000]   So if somebody.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:04.640]   Transitions.
[01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:06.060]   And they sell their closely held business.
[01:02:06.060 --> 01:02:07.160]   For 20 million bucks.
[01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:09.460]   Well that would be the perfect thing.
[01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:10.460]   To go ahead and diversify.
[01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:11.740]   Out of that closely held business.
[01:02:11.740 --> 01:02:12.620]   Into other stocks.
[01:02:12.620 --> 01:02:14.340]   That would be a really good.
[01:02:14.340 --> 01:02:15.500]   A really good situation.
[01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:16.140]   So look at.
[01:02:16.140 --> 01:02:17.220]   You can just look at the numbers.
[01:02:17.220 --> 01:02:18.700]   And then look at the rates of return.
[01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:19.220]   And with this.
[01:02:19.220 --> 01:02:20.100]   You can coach yourself.
[01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:21.220]   Is all of your money.
[01:02:21.220 --> 01:02:22.000]   Sitting in cash.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.500]   Is that good or bad.
[01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:24.080]   Well it depends.
[01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:25.260]   Are you sitting there.
[01:02:25.260 --> 01:02:26.120]   And it's sitting in cash.
[01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:27.540]   Ready to go over to the use assets.
[01:02:27.540 --> 01:02:28.600]   We're going to start going down.
[01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:30.220]   You're going to buy a big fancy car.
[01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:31.860]   Probably not a good idea.
[01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:33.280]   At the beginning stages.
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:34.500]   Of wealth accumulation at least.
[01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:36.300]   Or are you looking for a good investment.
[01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:37.520]   And there's nothing wrong.
[01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:38.180]   With sitting back.
[01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:39.400]   And stockpiling cash.
[01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:40.180]   And just saying.
[01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:41.540]   I'm waiting for a good investment.
[01:02:41.540 --> 01:02:43.040]   I don't know what it is yet.
[01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:44.500]   I don't know whether it's a.
[01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:46.600]   A frozen yogurt franchise.
[01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:47.820]   A horse farm.
[01:02:47.820 --> 01:02:49.160]   A race car company.
[01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:50.580]   Or a new company.
[01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:51.640]   That I see on Kickstarter.
[01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:52.860]   I don't know.
[01:02:52.860 --> 01:02:54.260]   But I'm looking for a good investment.
[01:02:54.260 --> 01:02:55.080]   I'm just going to sit back.
[01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:56.680]   And stockpile cash until then.
[01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:57.860]   Or are you saying.
[01:02:57.860 --> 01:02:58.980]   I'm getting ready to spend this.
[01:02:58.980 --> 01:03:00.120]   And if you'll look at.
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:00.580]   Same thing.
[01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:00.700]   If you'll look at.
[01:03:00.700 --> 01:03:00.740]   If you'll look at.
[01:03:00.740 --> 01:03:01.600]   If you look at your liabilities.
[01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:02.680]   If you look at your liabilities.
[01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:03.480]   And we'll talk about this.
[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:04.100]   On another show.
[01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:04.720]   In detail.
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:06.260]   But if you look at your liabilities.
[01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:06.900]   And you see.
[01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:08.140]   Credit card balances.
[01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:09.140]   For personal consumption.
[01:03:09.140 --> 01:03:10.080]   Furniture loan.
[01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:11.000]   For personal consumption.
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:11.820]   Auto loan.
[01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:12.800]   For personal consumption.
[01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:13.760]   Student loan.
[01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:15.300]   For personal consumption.
[01:03:15.300 --> 01:03:16.040]   With a career.
[01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:16.740]   That didn't result.
[01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:17.500]   In a high degree.
[01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:19.580]   Of financial earning ability.
[01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:20.700]   Mortgage loans.
[01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:22.160]   For an overly expensive house.
[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:22.740]   That I live in.
[01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:23.660]   For personal consumption.
[01:03:23.660 --> 01:03:24.800]   And you don't see.
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:26.020]   Any positive.
[01:03:26.020 --> 01:03:27.340]   Any positive.
[01:03:27.340 --> 01:03:28.680]   Output of the liabilities.
[01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:29.400]   Now you know.
[01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:30.280]   Why you're broke.
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:31.600]   But on the other hand.
[01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:32.700]   You may look over there.
[01:03:32.700 --> 01:03:33.140]   And say.
[01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:33.700]   You know.
[01:03:33.700 --> 01:03:34.220]   Again.
[01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:34.800]   I always go back.
[01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:35.580]   Because it's just a famous.
[01:03:35.580 --> 01:03:37.100]   And famous example.
[01:03:37.100 --> 01:03:38.280]   With Donald Trump.
[01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:38.800]   Back when he was.
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:39.980]   A billion dollars in debt.
[01:03:39.980 --> 01:03:41.600]   He wasn't a billion dollars.
[01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:42.120]   In debt.
[01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:43.220]   To fund his.
[01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:44.520]   He wasn't a billion dollars.
[01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:44.880]   In debt.
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:46.020]   To fund a credit card bill.
[01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:46.820]   He was a billion dollars.
[01:03:46.820 --> 01:03:47.260]   In debt.
[01:03:47.260 --> 01:03:48.540]   Because the entire values.
[01:03:48.540 --> 01:03:49.780]   Of his real estate portfolio.
[01:03:49.780 --> 01:03:50.640]   Was destroyed.
[01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:52.280]   And he had to figure out.
[01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:53.320]   How do I come out of this?
[01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:54.560]   So a billion dollars.
[01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:55.420]   Of business debt.
[01:03:55.420 --> 01:03:57.100]   Is a very different situation.
[01:03:57.100 --> 01:03:57.960]   Than a billion dollars.
[01:03:57.960 --> 01:03:58.780]   You would never have.
[01:03:58.780 --> 01:03:59.380]   A billion dollars.
[01:03:59.380 --> 01:04:00.060]   Of credit card debt.
[01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:01.140]   And the reality is.
[01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:02.020]   In that situation.
[01:04:02.020 --> 01:04:03.200]   If Donald Trump.
[01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:03.900]   Had gone bankrupt.
[01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:04.320]   Again.
[01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:05.420]   This is the situation.
[01:04:05.420 --> 01:04:06.140]   That I remember.
[01:04:06.140 --> 01:04:06.640]   From his book.
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:07.300]   The Art of the Deal.
[01:04:07.300 --> 01:04:08.120]   I read years ago.
[01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:09.860]   That billion dollars.
[01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:10.200]   Of debt.
[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:11.220]   Could easily be discharged.
[01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:11.820]   In bankruptcy.
[01:04:11.820 --> 01:04:12.640]   And he'd be left.
[01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:13.540]   To start over again.
[01:04:13.540 --> 01:04:14.720]   So it's not the same.
[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:15.660]   As if somebody owes.
[01:04:15.660 --> 01:04:16.880]   It's not the same.
[01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:19.020]   I would rather be Donald Trump.
[01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:20.180]   And owe a billion dollars.
[01:04:20.180 --> 01:04:20.580]   Of debt.
[01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:21.120]   That's secured.
[01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:21.980]   By real estate.
[01:04:21.980 --> 01:04:23.440]   That could all be discharged.
[01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:24.180]   In the personal.
[01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:25.460]   Bankruptcy proceeding.
[01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:26.780]   Then be somebody.
[01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:27.860]   Who had spent.
[01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:29.000]   A hundred thousand dollars.
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.340]   On a.
[01:04:30.340 --> 01:04:31.560]   A college degree.
[01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:32.820]   Financed by debt.
[01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:34.280]   That wasn't.
[01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:35.240]   That the college degree.
[01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:36.000]   Wasn't pursued.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.520]   For the sake of academic knowledge.
[01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:37.900]   But rather.
[01:04:37.900 --> 01:04:39.040]   For the sake of an earning ability.
[01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:40.060]   And now I'm working.
[01:04:40.060 --> 01:04:40.900]   As a social worker.
[01:04:40.900 --> 01:04:42.260]   Making thirty two thousand dollars.
[01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:42.640]   A year.
[01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:43.800]   And I have no hope.
[01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:44.640]   Of ever getting free.
[01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:45.660]   Of that student loan debt.
[01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:47.100]   Because it's not a bankruptable debt.
[01:04:47.100 --> 01:04:48.820]   I'd rather own the billion.
[01:04:48.820 --> 01:04:50.280]   And have a real estate portfolio.
[01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:50.980]   And have a business.
[01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:51.740]   Situation.
[01:04:51.740 --> 01:04:52.420]   That I could go.
[01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:53.480]   Go forward with.
[01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:54.940]   Than be in the second position.
[01:04:54.940 --> 01:04:55.980]   Because in the second.
[01:04:55.980 --> 01:04:56.200]   Now.
[01:04:56.200 --> 01:04:57.360]   Can the second person.
[01:04:57.360 --> 01:04:58.760]   Renegotiate.
[01:04:58.760 --> 01:04:59.640]   In their entire life.
[01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:00.120]   And.
[01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:01.380]   Kind of fix the situation.
[01:05:01.380 --> 01:05:02.000]   Absolutely.
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:02.540]   They can.
[01:05:02.540 --> 01:05:04.480]   They absolutely can.
[01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:05.260]   But.
[01:05:05.260 --> 01:05:06.840]   Just kind of.
[01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:07.920]   Just think about that.
[01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:09.040]   And I'll.
[01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:10.020]   I'll kind of quit with that.
[01:05:10.020 --> 01:05:10.620]   So.
[01:05:10.620 --> 01:05:12.860]   Once you can see these numbers.
[01:05:12.860 --> 01:05:14.220]   These will help you immensely.
[01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:15.340]   And you can sit back.
[01:05:15.340 --> 01:05:15.920]   And you can.
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:17.560]   And you can kind of coach yourself.
[01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:18.600]   And what can you learn from it?
[01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:19.520]   Where are your priorities?
[01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:22.580]   Don't.
[01:05:22.580 --> 01:05:23.520]   It's not a judgment statement.
[01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:24.120]   It's just.
[01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:25.220]   Where are your priorities?
[01:05:25.220 --> 01:05:26.000]   You know.
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.580]   Do you have any chance of getting rich?
[01:05:27.580 --> 01:05:29.760]   Do you have any chance of getting rich?
[01:05:30.300 --> 01:05:33.860]   Getting rich is not generally something that happens accidentally.
[01:05:33.860 --> 01:05:35.480]   It's something that happens purposefully.
[01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:37.260]   You have income.
[01:05:37.260 --> 01:05:39.720]   You have less expenses than you have income.
[01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:41.560]   And you invest the surplus income.
[01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:43.260]   Into assets that grow over time.
[01:05:43.260 --> 01:05:44.860]   There's your formula for getting rich.
[01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:45.820]   Now.
[01:05:45.820 --> 01:05:46.680]   You can tweak a few.
[01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:48.140]   You can tweak aspects of that.
[01:05:48.140 --> 01:05:48.900]   And control the speed.
[01:05:48.900 --> 01:05:50.520]   If you have higher income.
[01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:51.440]   Than lower income.
[01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:53.620]   Then it's probably easier to get rich.
[01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:55.780]   Doesn't mean you can't get rich on lower income.
[01:05:55.780 --> 01:05:57.920]   But it's probably easier on higher income.
[01:05:57.920 --> 01:05:58.740]   Versus lower income.
[01:05:58.740 --> 01:06:00.160]   So you can press those variables.
[01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:01.740]   And you can raise your income.
[01:06:01.740 --> 01:06:03.760]   Or you can choose to have a lower income.
[01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:04.880]   For other reasons.
[01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:05.900]   Expenses.
[01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:07.360]   If you have lower expenses.
[01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:08.360]   Than higher expenses.
[01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:10.220]   It's going to be easier to get rich.
[01:06:10.220 --> 01:06:12.040]   If you can create a greater margin.
[01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:13.000]   A greater differential.
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.020]   Between your expenses and your income.
[01:06:15.020 --> 01:06:15.660]   Now.
[01:06:15.660 --> 01:06:17.200]   Is it valid to say to someone.
[01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:17.880]   That.
[01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:18.440]   You know.
[01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:20.520]   Is it valid to say.
[01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:23.100]   Well you're stupid if you don't buy the latte every day.
[01:06:23.100 --> 01:06:24.440]   Because if you enjoy the latte.
[01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:25.160]   You should do it.
[01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:26.060]   And you raise your income.
[01:06:26.060 --> 01:06:26.840]   Well sure.
[01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:28.140]   That may be a lifestyle choice.
[01:06:28.140 --> 01:06:29.080]   And that's fine.
[01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:30.080]   But it still doesn't.
[01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:31.520]   Doesn't ignore the mathematical.
[01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:32.440]   That doesn't.
[01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:35.120]   There is still a mathematical reality.
[01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:36.520]   That the lower the expenses.
[01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:37.620]   And the higher the income.
[01:06:37.620 --> 01:06:38.440]   And the greater the difference.
[01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:39.380]   The faster the results.
[01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:41.720]   Could you lose weight.
[01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:42.720]   Eating pizza.
[01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:43.600]   Every day.
[01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:44.260]   Probably.
[01:06:44.260 --> 01:06:46.500]   If you figured out.
[01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:46.840]   You know.
[01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:48.500]   A way to restrict your calories to a level.
[01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:50.060]   Could you lose weight faster.
[01:06:50.060 --> 01:06:51.720]   By eating pizza once a week.
[01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:52.560]   Versus every day.
[01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:53.660]   I would say so.
[01:06:53.660 --> 01:06:55.460]   Could you lose weight even faster.
[01:06:55.460 --> 01:06:57.160]   By never eating pizza.
[01:06:57.160 --> 01:06:58.660]   Probably so.
[01:06:58.660 --> 01:07:00.180]   But.
[01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:02.420]   Then you get into the behavior modification.
[01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:03.720]   Of are you going to fall off the wagon.
[01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:06.480]   And because you went from eating pizza every day.
[01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:07.760]   Three meals a day.
[01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:09.040]   To never eating pizza.
[01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:10.860]   Now you're just miserable with life.
[01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:11.760]   And then you just say.
[01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:12.360]   After a month.
[01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:13.280]   I quit and I give up.
[01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:14.820]   And I'm going to go back to eating pizza every day.
[01:07:14.820 --> 01:07:16.800]   Same thing with money.
[01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:17.280]   So.
[01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:18.500]   The lower the expenses.
[01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:19.820]   Everything else held equal.
[01:07:19.820 --> 01:07:21.000]   The faster the wealth building.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:21.980]   And then the third aspect.
[01:07:21.980 --> 01:07:23.220]   Is what's the rate of return.
[01:07:23.220 --> 01:07:24.320]   On the investments.
[01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:25.060]   So.
[01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:25.780]   As I'm.
[01:07:25.780 --> 01:07:27.820]   As I'm taking money from cash flow.
[01:07:27.820 --> 01:07:29.060]   Allocating it.
[01:07:29.060 --> 01:07:30.220]   Taking out the net.
[01:07:30.340 --> 01:07:31.160]   Necessary expenses.
[01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:33.440]   Putting those necessary expenses over.
[01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:35.720]   Putting the surplus over into investments.
[01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:36.980]   What's the rate of return.
[01:07:36.980 --> 01:07:37.820]   On my investments.
[01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:39.420]   All else held equal.
[01:07:39.420 --> 01:07:40.920]   The higher the rate of return.
[01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:41.580]   On investments.
[01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:43.160]   Then the more wealth.
[01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:43.960]   I will accumulate.
[01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:44.680]   The faster.
[01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:48.440]   Those are mathematical realities.
[01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:49.640]   Not judgment.
[01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:50.700]   Not value judgment.
[01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:52.960]   Now we can all try to differentiate ourselves.
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:53.740]   And talk about.
[01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:54.160]   Well.
[01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:54.580]   You know.
[01:07:54.580 --> 01:07:56.260]   The latte factor is the key point.
[01:07:56.260 --> 01:07:57.560]   Or the latte factor is dumb.
[01:07:57.560 --> 01:07:57.860]   This is.
[01:07:57.860 --> 01:07:58.100]   I mean.
[01:07:58.100 --> 01:07:58.680]   These are pointless.
[01:07:58.680 --> 01:07:59.960]   These are pointless debates.
[01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:00.600]   But.
[01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:02.320]   You may choose what's best for you.
[01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:03.020]   And.
[01:08:03.020 --> 01:08:03.580]   And.
[01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:05.920]   I may be more highly motivated.
[01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:07.800]   By the idea of a high lifestyle.
[01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:08.640]   And so.
[01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:10.000]   I'll set myself a major.
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.480]   Expenditure goal.
[01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:11.800]   And say.
[01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:12.040]   Hey.
[01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:13.660]   If I can achieve this income goal.
[01:08:13.660 --> 01:08:14.860]   Then I'm going to spend this money.
[01:08:14.860 --> 01:08:16.820]   And that may motivate me to achieve that.
[01:08:16.820 --> 01:08:17.160]   That.
[01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:17.780]   That.
[01:08:17.780 --> 01:08:19.880]   That income goal.
[01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:21.260]   And that's totally valid.
[01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:22.440]   On the other hand.
[01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:23.120]   You may say.
[01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:24.800]   I don't care about that income goal.
[01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:25.520]   I'm going to.
[01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:26.140]   You know.
[01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:27.300]   Trim my expenses down.
[01:08:27.300 --> 01:08:28.560]   But that doesn't change.
[01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:30.180]   That this is mathematically true.
[01:08:30.180 --> 01:08:31.000]   And this is.
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.440]   As far as I'm concerned.
[01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:33.360]   This is incontrovertible.
[01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:34.660]   If you find some way that I'm wrong.
[01:08:34.660 --> 01:08:35.360]   Come by and tell me.
[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:36.400]   And I'll have you on the show.
[01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:37.140]   And I'll admit it.
[01:08:37.140 --> 01:08:38.420]   If you can show me that I'm wrong.
[01:08:38.420 --> 01:08:39.860]   But all the rest of this.
[01:08:39.860 --> 01:08:40.660]   Is all philosophy.
[01:08:40.660 --> 01:08:41.440]   And that's valuable.
[01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:41.960]   That's good.
[01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:43.300]   You figure out what works for you.
[01:08:43.300 --> 01:08:44.660]   But you can get rich.
[01:08:44.660 --> 01:08:45.940]   Making a small amount of money.
[01:08:45.940 --> 01:08:46.440]   And.
[01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:46.880]   And.
[01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:48.360]   Only spending a little bit.
[01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:49.140]   And you can get rich.
[01:08:49.140 --> 01:08:50.040]   Making a lot of money.
[01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:51.220]   And spending a lot.
[01:08:51.220 --> 01:08:52.360]   As long as there's a differential.
[01:08:52.360 --> 01:08:53.000]   Between the two.
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:53.440]   So.
[01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:55.080]   I think I beat that point.
[01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:56.560]   I think I beat that point.
[01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:57.820]   To the end of.
[01:08:58.100 --> 01:08:59.060]   To the end of.
[01:08:59.060 --> 01:09:00.200]   What it.
[01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:01.800]   What it needs for today.
[01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:05.400]   That's everything I want to talk about.
[01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:07.360]   With regard to the statement of financial condition.
[01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:08.660]   Or balance sheet.
[01:09:08.660 --> 01:09:10.580]   I never know which one to use for.
[01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:11.180]   I like statement.
[01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:12.040]   Because it makes me feel.
[01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:12.900]   I don't know.
[01:09:12.900 --> 01:09:14.800]   If you want to.
[01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:15.460]   Your accountants knows.
[01:09:15.460 --> 01:09:16.280]   Which one I should use.
[01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:17.020]   Or if you guys prefer.
[01:09:17.020 --> 01:09:18.020]   Most people are more familiar.
[01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:19.200]   With the term balance sheet.
[01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:21.120]   But I just like statement of financial condition.
[01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:22.340]   It makes me feel a little bit more.
[01:09:22.340 --> 01:09:23.360]   A county.
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:24.020]   A businessy.
[01:09:24.020 --> 01:09:24.880]   And then I like to look.
[01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:25.620]   And do this.
[01:09:25.620 --> 01:09:26.360]   And I tell you.
[01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:27.100]   If you want to be motivated.
[01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:28.400]   Now.
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:29.740]   I would imagine.
[01:09:29.740 --> 01:09:30.800]   Many of you will not do this.
[01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:31.880]   But if you're a nerd like me.
[01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:33.140]   Why don't you.
[01:09:33.140 --> 01:09:34.720]   Create this formally.
[01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:35.580]   Use the.
[01:09:35.580 --> 01:09:37.100]   Template that I've given you.
[01:09:37.100 --> 01:09:38.660]   Put it into a nice document.
[01:09:38.660 --> 01:09:39.680]   Put a logo.
[01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:40.420]   For your family.
[01:09:40.420 --> 01:09:41.140]   At the top.
[01:09:41.140 --> 01:09:41.460]   You know.
[01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:41.880]   For me.
[01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:42.960]   It would be the Joshua Sheets.
[01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:43.640]   Family enterprise.
[01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:45.280]   And treat it like a business.
[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:45.760]   You know.
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:47.360]   I actually am making a switch.
[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:48.440]   For all you accounting nerds.
[01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:49.120]   I'm making a switch.
[01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:50.080]   In my personal finances.
[01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:51.320]   From single entry accounting.
[01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:52.540]   To double entry accounting.
[01:09:52.540 --> 01:09:53.840]   For my own personal household.
[01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:55.560]   Because I've fallen so in love.
[01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:56.560]   With double entry accounting.
[01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:57.180]   In my business.
[01:09:57.180 --> 01:09:58.060]   And I see.
[01:09:58.060 --> 01:09:58.960]   The value of it.
[01:09:58.960 --> 01:09:59.920]   I'm actually making the switch.
[01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:00.920]   And I'm trying to make the switch over.
[01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:02.420]   For my personal financial tracking.
[01:10:02.420 --> 01:10:03.660]   From single entry.
[01:10:03.660 --> 01:10:04.340]   To double entry.
[01:10:04.340 --> 01:10:04.800]   So.
[01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:05.640]   If you don't know what that means.
[01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:06.020]   Ignore it.
[01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:07.120]   I'll explain it in a future show.
[01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:08.060]   But I just think it's really.
[01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:09.100]   I think it's.
[01:10:09.100 --> 01:10:10.180]   It makes me feel good.
[01:10:10.180 --> 01:10:10.980]   It makes me feel.
[01:10:10.980 --> 01:10:12.060]   Controlled.
[01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:12.640]   And empowered.
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:14.140]   So.
[01:10:14.140 --> 01:10:15.380]   That's our show for today.
[01:10:15.380 --> 01:10:16.160]   And.
[01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:17.600]   I appreciate your listening.
[01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:19.640]   It's been fun to bring it to you.
[01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:21.960]   I will plan some future shows here.
[01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:22.420]   On.
[01:10:22.420 --> 01:10:22.640]   Again.
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:23.240]   We'll do a show.
[01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:24.960]   On preparing a statement of cash flows.
[01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:26.040]   And we'll talk through that.
[01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:27.440]   Reference please.
[01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:28.040]   The document.
[01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:29.660]   The document that's listed in the show notes.
[01:10:29.660 --> 01:10:30.620]   And create your own.
[01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:31.360]   Based upon that.
[01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:32.340]   Create a Google spreadsheet.
[01:10:32.340 --> 01:10:33.700]   Write it down on a piece of legal paper.
[01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:34.940]   This is step one.
[01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:37.160]   Of any kind of financial planning.
[01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:38.140]   And you can do this yourself.
[01:10:38.140 --> 01:10:39.040]   You can hire it done.
[01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:40.240]   But I would encourage you.
[01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:42.260]   Consider the power of a financial statement.
[01:10:42.260 --> 01:10:43.300]   And what you'll see is.
[01:10:43.300 --> 01:10:43.600]   Notice.
[01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:44.360]   Just notice this.
[01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:45.080]   Thing that I have noticed.
[01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:46.920]   The greatest investors in the world.
[01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:48.860]   Are always investors who.
[01:10:48.860 --> 01:10:49.620]   Who.
[01:10:49.620 --> 01:10:50.000]   I mean.
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:50.320]   They.
[01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:50.680]   They.
[01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:51.700]   They look at the balance sheet.
[01:10:51.700 --> 01:10:52.520]   And they understand them.
[01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:53.260]   So.
[01:10:53.260 --> 01:10:54.380]   That's our show for today.
[01:10:54.380 --> 01:10:55.140]   Before we go.
[01:10:55.140 --> 01:10:56.300]   I want to thank you all.
[01:10:56.300 --> 01:10:57.900]   For the wonderful reviews.
[01:10:58.020 --> 01:10:58.560]   That I'm getting.
[01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:00.380]   We've got some new reviews here.
[01:11:00.380 --> 01:11:01.520]   And.
[01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:02.620]   Let me get them pulled up here.
[01:11:02.620 --> 01:11:02.840]   Okay.
[01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:03.520]   So.

[01:11:07.620 --> 01:11:08.340]   Five star review.
[01:11:08.340 --> 01:11:09.700]   Advanced financial information.

[01:11:12.140 --> 01:11:12.740]   To the masses.
[01:11:12.740 --> 01:11:13.800]   In a positive way.
[01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:14.860]   A great podcast.
[01:11:14.860 --> 01:11:16.560]   If you're looking to expand your financial knowledge.

[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:29.300]   He says.

[01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:33.120]   So.

[01:11:55.300 --> 01:11:56.940]   That covers so many situations.

[01:12:16.660 --> 01:12:17.460]   To get to the diamonds.
[01:12:17.460 --> 01:12:19.560]   Becomes an increasingly difficult task.
[01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:20.120]   Mr.

[01:12:23.380 --> 01:12:23.880]   On common.
[01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:24.780]   Everyday issues.
[01:12:24.780 --> 01:12:25.960]   Facing those of us.
[01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:27.200]   Who striving to grow.
[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:27.840]   In our stewardship.
[01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:28.520]   Of resources.
[01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:29.360]   And responsibilities.
[01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:30.040]   As citizens.
[01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:31.000]   Contributors.
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:31.960]   And beneficiaries.
[01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:32.760]   Of a complex.
[01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:33.260]   And diverse.
[01:12:33.260 --> 01:12:34.100]   Economic system.
[01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:35.120]   So excited.
[01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:35.980]   To have found this podcast.
[01:12:35.980 --> 01:12:36.800]   Let's all be challenged.
[01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:37.600]   To question the popular.
[01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:38.320]   Financial wisdom.
[01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:39.140]   And lifestyle norms.
[01:12:39.140 --> 01:12:40.420]   That means the world to me.
[01:12:40.420 --> 01:12:41.640]   And I just really appreciate.
[01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:42.920]   I really appreciate.
[01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:43.820]   That review.
[01:12:43.820 --> 01:12:45.500]   Thank you very much.
[01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:46.480]   Keep the reviews coming.
[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:47.340]   If you haven't done so.
[01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:47.900]   Please.
[01:12:47.900 --> 01:12:48.660]   Leave me a review.
[01:12:48.660 --> 01:12:49.620]   One star is fine.
[01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:50.220]   Five stars.
[01:12:50.220 --> 01:12:51.260]   Stars is fine.
[01:12:51.260 --> 01:12:52.540]   I would really love.
[01:12:52.540 --> 01:12:53.440]   For this podcast.
[01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:54.340]   To be able to be featured.
[01:12:54.340 --> 01:12:54.900]   In iTunes.
[01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:56.640]   And to the best of my knowledge.
[01:12:56.640 --> 01:12:57.640]   The way that those formulas.
[01:12:57.940 --> 01:12:58.060]   Work.
[01:12:58.060 --> 01:12:59.360]   Is based upon.
[01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:00.720]   The reviews.
[01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:01.700]   The ratings.
[01:13:01.700 --> 01:13:02.560]   And the downloads.
[01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:03.440]   And so.
[01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:04.800]   I'm doing everything I can.
[01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:05.080]   To try.
[01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:05.320]   I mean.
[01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:05.880]   I got my brother.
[01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:06.280]   And my dad.
[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:07.000]   To review my show.
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:08.660]   So I appreciate.
[01:13:08.660 --> 01:13:09.960]   Any help that you can provide.
[01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:10.720]   If you like the show.

[01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:12.460]   That would be in the world.
[01:13:12.460 --> 01:13:13.540]   You can do it right on your phone.
[01:13:13.540 --> 01:13:15.540]   Stay tuned for tomorrow's Q&A show.
[01:13:15.540 --> 01:13:16.380]   Give me your feedback.
[01:13:16.380 --> 01:13:16.940]   On the show.
[01:13:16.940 --> 01:13:17.360]   Tell me what.
[01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:17.500]   No.
[01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:18.000]   What you like.
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:18.700]   What you don't like.
[01:13:18.700 --> 01:13:19.460]   That will help me.
[01:13:19.460 --> 01:13:20.280]   To tailor the content.
[01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:21.400]   I know we went deep today.
[01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:22.140]   But.
[01:13:22.140 --> 01:13:23.380]   I hope it was.
[01:13:23.380 --> 01:13:24.580]   I hope it was worthwhile.
[01:13:24.580 --> 01:13:25.900]   And I hope it helped you.
[01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:26.920]   To get a bigger idea.
[01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:27.420]   Of.
[01:13:27.420 --> 01:13:27.920]   Of.
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:29.420]   The way that accounting.
[01:13:29.420 --> 01:13:30.000]   Could work.
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:31.320]   Remember.
[01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:33.220]   With my financial show.
[01:13:33.220 --> 01:13:33.720]   I've got to get.
[01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:35.020]   Some sort of formal disclaimer.
[01:13:35.020 --> 01:13:35.700]   I don't know why.
[01:13:35.700 --> 01:13:36.700]   You're supposed to do disclaimers.
[01:13:36.700 --> 01:13:37.560]   I guess you're supposed to.
[01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:38.180]   That.
[01:13:38.180 --> 01:13:39.300]   I think it is important.
[01:13:39.300 --> 01:13:40.240]   But I don't know.
[01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:40.580]   It just.
[01:13:40.580 --> 01:13:42.060]   Seems really stupid to me.
[01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:43.380]   To have to make a disclaimer.
[01:13:43.380 --> 01:13:44.700]   But when you're in the financial world.
[01:13:44.700 --> 01:13:45.540]   That's a big deal.
[01:13:45.540 --> 01:13:45.820]   So.
[01:13:45.820 --> 01:13:47.080]   None of this is.
[01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:48.360]   Personal financial advice.
[01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:49.020]   You should go.
[01:13:49.020 --> 01:13:49.820]   And talk to a professional.
[01:13:49.820 --> 01:13:50.180]   Please.
[01:13:50.180 --> 01:13:51.260]   Hopefully you can see.
[01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:52.580]   That the value.
[01:13:52.580 --> 01:13:53.640]   That professionals could bring.
[01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:54.800]   The value of hiring an accountant.
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:55.420]   Or a bookkeeper.
[01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:56.140]   To prepare your books.
[01:13:56.140 --> 01:13:56.620]   Every month.
[01:13:56.620 --> 01:13:57.340]   And just.
[01:13:57.340 --> 01:13:58.640]   Start running your life.
[01:13:58.640 --> 01:13:59.160]   Like a business.
[01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:00.380]   Do this for yourself.
[01:14:00.380 --> 01:14:00.860]   If you want.
[01:14:00.860 --> 01:14:02.240]   Automate it for yourself.
[01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:02.880]   That's awesome.
[01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:04.020]   Or hire it done.
[01:14:04.020 --> 01:14:05.560]   But before you do anything.
[01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:06.440]   Go and consult.
[01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:07.080]   A professional.
[01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:08.060]   Advisors.
[01:14:08.060 --> 01:14:09.160]   My goal is not to tell you.
[01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:09.660]   What to do.
[01:14:09.660 --> 01:14:11.300]   But rather to give you some ideas.
[01:14:11.300 --> 01:14:12.000]   And strategies.
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.220]   To help you accomplish your goals.
[01:14:13.220 --> 01:14:14.420]   We'll be back tomorrow.
[01:14:14.420 --> 01:14:16.120]   With a Friday's Q&A show.
[01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:16.960]   See you then.
[01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:18.960]   Bye.
[01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:20.960]   Bye.
