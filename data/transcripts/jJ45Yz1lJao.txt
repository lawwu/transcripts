[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:23.320]   All right, who is excited about evals?
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.320]   All right, what can I do to get those juices flowing?
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.600]   I'm Manu, and I work at Braintrust,
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.320]   where we build a platform to do evals and a whole bunch of other stuff.
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.640]   So I was thinking we could just start
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.400]   by talking a little bit about my own personal evals journey.
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.840]   Now, you might see this picture and say,
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.840]   "Oh, what an adorable little boy absorbed in his Nintendo 64 video game."
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.840]   But if you look a little closer,
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.640]   you'll see a boy who's deeply disappointed,
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.920]   with the state of technology in his society.
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.040]   Because this boy, he knows that technology is not meant to be shackled
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.920]   to the constraints of rule-based systems,
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.360]   doomed to do the same thing over and over and over.
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.920]   No, technology is meant to come alive, to grow and adapt,
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.200]   and really be a thought partner to mankind.
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.200]   So I knew this in this moment,
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.400]   which is why I decided to devote my career
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.200]   to being a software engineer in the AI industry.
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.200]   And so I dropped the Nintendo,
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.200]   and I started grinding away on Leet Code.
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.880]   And soon enough, I landed a job in the self-driving car industry.
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.280]   Now, we can all learn a lot about self-driving cars,
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.960]   but the thing I took away was that you can spend all day tuning the model,
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.160]   changing the architecture, adjusting the loss function, all good stuff,
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:59.200]   but it's never going to be enough for you to actually ship it to production.
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:07.920]   I can't say, "Oh, my image classification rate went from 98% to 99%, put it on the road."
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.880]   We need some way to contextualize this model and understand
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.000]   if it actually works for our real-world application.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.400]   You know, does it avoid pedestrians?
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.480]   Does it negotiate traffic scenarios appropriately?
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.080]   Does it obey the law?
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.480]   All this stuff we actually need to understand.
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.640]   And how we're going to do that is with evals.
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.360]   Now, you know, the whole point here is, you know,
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.920]   evals aren't just unit tests for AI.
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.640]   They're not just for finding regressions, right?
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.520]   If I didn't have evals, the only way I can get any signal on my changes
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.640]   is by shipping it to prod and then getting signal, you know, in the real world.
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.720]   But that's expensive, it's slow, and ultimately, it's pretty risky.
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.680]   So what do evals do is it's kind of like if you invest in good evals, you're kind of building
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:06.960]   a laboratory that lets you run experiments to your heart's content and do 90% of the product
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:14.080]   iteration loop before going to prod, and then now you can ship much more quickly, much more confidently.
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:23.600]   Now, furthermore, if you actually apply the same metrics from offline to your online production
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:29.680]   data, you now have data-driven signal about which examples in prod are going to be most useful
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.920]   for that next iteration loop.
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:39.040]   And so, with all of this knowledge, my evals journey had completed and I transformed from
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.800]   this guy to this guy.
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.720]   So, success.
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:50.000]   Now, if this heartfelt childhood story isn't enough to do it for you, you don't have to take
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.480]   my word.
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.680]   You can take the words of all of these tech luminaries.
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:02.880]   We have Kevin Weil, Gary Tan, Mike Krieger, Greg Brockman, all extolling the virtues
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.280]   and the necessities of evals.
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.280]   And surely, if they're all saying it, there's got to be something to it.
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.520]   It can't be a total scam.
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.960]   So, there's got to be some, there's got to be something worth checking out here.
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.480]   So, with all that buzz, I made my way to Braintrust where our goal is to sort of build
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:31.040]   the dev platform to, of course, let you do evals but also do all the things that go along with it.
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.680]   So, that involves, you know, tweaking prompts and experimenting in the playground.
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:42.320]   It involves logging data and sort of getting the observability component and kind of connecting all
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:49.360]   those together in this beautiful data flywheel so that we can, we can let you build the data flywheel
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.560]   to let your AI dreams come true.
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.680]   Because that's really what, what we're here for.
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:01.920]   Now, I know this was a dense and content heavy presentation.
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.080]   So, I'll try to distill it with one simple message.
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.320]   which is that the key to industry transformation.
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.240]   The key to success.
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:33.600]   It's evals, evals, evals, evals, evals, evals, evals, evals, evals, evals, evals, evals, evals, evals, evals, evals, evals, evals, evals, evals, evals, evals, evals, evals, evals, evals, evals, evals, evals, evals, all right, thank you, please join the evals track, Golden Gate Ballroom B, I'll see you there.
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:40.480]   Thank you.
