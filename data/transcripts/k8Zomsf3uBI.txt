[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240]   - Let's start with the basics.
[00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.160]   So you've also formulated a fascinating principle,
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.520]   the free energy principle.
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.320]   Can we maybe start at the basics
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.640]   and what is the free energy principle?
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.240]   - Well, in fact, the free energy principle
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.680]   inherits a lot from the building
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.240]   of these data analytic approaches
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.160]   to these very high dimensional time series
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.960]   you get from the brain.
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.960]   So I think it's interesting to acknowledge that.
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.960]   And in particular, the analysis tools
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.120]   that try to address the other side,
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.360]   which is a functional integration.
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.060]   So the connectivity analysis.
[00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:47.880]   On the one hand, but I should also acknowledge
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.320]   it inherits an awful lot from machine learning as well.
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.480]   So the free energy principle
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.600]   is just a formal statement
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.240]   that the existential imperatives
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.040]   for any system that manages to survive
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.400]   in a changing world
[00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:13.920]   can be cast as an inference problem
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.240]   in the sense that you could interpret
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.720]   the probability of existing as the evidence that you exist.
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.480]   And if you can write down that problem of existence
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.880]   as a statistical problem,
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.280]   then you can use all the maths
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.200]   that has been developed for inference
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.200]   to understand and characterize the ensemble dynamics
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.600]   that must be in play in the service of that inference.
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.280]   So technically what that means is
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.200]   you can always interpret anything that exists
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.680]   in virtue of being separate from the environment
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.760]   in which it exists
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.760]   as trying to minimize variational free energy.
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.600]   And if you're from the machine learning community,
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.240]   you will know that as a negative evidence lower bound
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.440]   or a negative elbow,
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.360]   which is the same as saying you're trying to maximize
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.880]   or it will look as if all your dynamics
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.920]   are trying to maximize the compliment of that,
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.040]   which is the marginal likelihood
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.520]   or the evidence for your own existence.
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.160]   So that's basically the free energy principle.
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.120]   - But to even take a sort of a small step backwards,
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.120]   you said the existential imperative.
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.120]   There's a lot of beautiful poetic words here,
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.360]   but to put it crudely,
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:44.080]   it's a fascinating idea of basically
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.800]   of trying to describe if you're looking at a blob,
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.200]   how do you know this thing is alive?
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.680]   What does it mean to be alive?
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.480]   What does it mean to exist?
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.440]   And so you can look at the brain,
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.680]   you can look at parts of the brain,
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.840]   or this is just a general principle
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.200]   that applies to almost any system.
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.120]   That's just a fascinating sort of philosophically
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.080]   at every level question and a methodology
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.320]   to try to answer that question.
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.000]   What does it mean to be alive?
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.840]   - Yes.
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.920]   - So that's a huge endeavor,
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.160]   and it's nice that there's at least some,
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.440]   from some perspective, a clean answer.
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.240]   So maybe can you talk about that optimization view of it?
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.520]   So what's trying to be minimized and maximized?
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.840]   A system that's alive, what is it trying to minimize?
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.360]   - Right, you've made a big move there.
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.440]   - Apologize.
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.000]   - No, no, it's good to make big moves.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:47.440]   But you've assumed that the thing exists in a state
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.680]   that could be living or non-living.
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.720]   So I may ask you, well,
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.120]   what licenses you to say that something exists?
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.280]   That's why I use the word existential.
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.440]   It's beyond living, it's just existence.
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.040]   So if you drill down onto the definition
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:09.040]   of things that exist, then they have certain properties.
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.400]   If you borrow the maths
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.400]   from non-equilibrium steady state physics,
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.400]   that enable you to interpret their existence
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.320]   in terms of this optimization procedure.
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.160]   So it's good you introduced the word optimization.
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.080]   So what the free energy principle in its sort of
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.080]   most ambitious but also most deflationary
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.200]   and simplest says is that if something exists,
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.440]   then it must, by the mathematics
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.160]   of non-equilibrium steady state,
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:56.760]   exhibit properties that make it look as if
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.720]   it is optimizing a particular quantity.
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.160]   And it turns out that particular quantity
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.560]   happens to be exactly the same
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.360]   as the evidence lower bound in machine learning
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.320]   or Bayesian model evidence in Bayesian statistics,
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.360]   or, and then I can list a whole other,
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.360]   list of ways of understanding this key quantity,
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.480]   which is a bound on surprisal, self-information,
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.000]   if you're in information theory.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.280]   There are a whole, there are a number
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.720]   of different perspectives on this quantity.
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.960]   It's just basically the log probability
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.160]   of being in a particular state.
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.840]   I'm telling this story as an honest,
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.600]   an attempt to answer your question.
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.280]   And I'm answering it as if I was pretending
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.400]   to be a physicist who was trying to understand
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:53.120]   the fundaments of non-equilibrium steady state.
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.640]   And I shouldn't really be doing that
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.240]   because the last time I was taught physics,
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.760]   I was in my 20s.
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.440]   - What kind of systems, when you think about
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.400]   the free energy principle,
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.640]   what kind of systems are you imagining?
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.640]   As a sort of more specific kind of case study.
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:11.720]   - Yeah, I'm imagining a range of systems,
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:16.720]   but at its simplest, a single-celled organism
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:22.040]   that can be identified from its economy,
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.720]   show its environment.
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.520]   So at its simplest, that's basically
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.880]   what I always imagined in my head.
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.680]   And you may ask, well, is there any,
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:37.680]   how on earth can you even elaborate questions
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:43.040]   about the existence of a single drop of oil, for example?
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.800]   But there are deep questions there.
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.880]   Why doesn't the oil, why doesn't the thing,
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:51.480]   the interface between the drop of oil
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.840]   that contains an interior
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.640]   and the thing that is not the drop of oil,
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.200]   which is the solvent in which it is immersed,
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.440]   how does that interface persist over time?
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.760]   Why doesn't the oil just dissolve into solvent?
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:12.400]   So what special properties of the exchange
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.600]   between the surface of the oil drop
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:18.280]   and the external states in which it's immersed,
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.440]   if you're a physicist, say it would be the heat path.
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.240]   You know, you've got a physical system,
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.760]   an ensemble again, we're talking about
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.680]   density dynamics, ensemble dynamics,
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:32.400]   an ensemble of atoms or molecules immersed in the heat path.
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.440]   But the question is, how did the heat path get there
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.360]   and why does it not dissolve?
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.800]   - How is it maintaining itself?
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:39.640]   - Exactly.
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:40.480]   - What actions is it?
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.520]   I mean, it's such a fascinating idea of a drop of oil
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:46.000]   and I guess it would dissolve in water,
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.680]   it wouldn't dissolve in water.
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:48.520]   So what--
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:50.080]   - Precisely, so why not?
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.200]   - Why not? - Why not?
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.000]   - And how do you mathematically describe,
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.640]   I mean, it's such a beautiful idea
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:58.120]   and also the idea of like, where does the thing,
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:03.120]   where does the drop of oil end and where does it begin?
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:06.560]   - Right, so I mean, you're asking deep questions,
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.680]   deep in a non-millennial sense here.
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:09.520]   (laughing)
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:10.840]   - Not in a hierarchical sense.
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.440]   (laughing)
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:17.440]   - But what you can do, so this is the deflationary part of it.
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.560]   Can I just qualify my answer by saying
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:20.920]   that normally when I'm asked this question,
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.760]   I answer from the point of view of a psychologist
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:25.240]   and we talk about predictive processing and predictive coding
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.800]   and the brain is an inference machine,
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:30.080]   but you haven't asked me from that perspective,
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.400]   I'm answering from the point of view of a physicist.
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:37.200]   So the question is not so much why,
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.640]   but if it exists, what properties must it display?
[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.080]   So that's the deflationary part of the free energy principle.
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:47.000]   The free energy principle does not supply an answer
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.720]   as to why, it's saying if something exists,
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:53.880]   then it must display these properties.
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:57.720]   That's the sort of the thing that's on offer.
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:01.400]   And it so happens that these properties it must display
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:06.400]   are actually intriguing and have this inferential gloss,
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.840]   this sort of self-evidencing gloss
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:14.120]   that inherits on the fact that the very preservation
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:18.880]   of the boundary between the oil drop and the not oil drop
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:22.360]   requires an optimization of a particular function
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:26.800]   or a functional that defines the presence
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.240]   of the existence of this oil drop,
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:32.320]   which is why I started with existential imperatives.
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:35.720]   It is a necessary condition for existence
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:39.040]   that this must occur because the boundary
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:42.200]   basically defines the thing that's existing.
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.160]   So it is that self-assembly aspect
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:49.160]   that you were hinting at in biology,
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.920]   sometimes known as autopoiesis
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:56.320]   in computational chemistry with self-assembly.
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:59.760]   It's the, what does it look like?
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.200]   Sorry, how would you describe things
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.800]   that configure themselves out of nothing?
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:08.160]   The way they clearly demarcate themselves
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:12.840]   from the states or the soup in which they are immersed.
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:17.120]   So from the point of view of computational chemistry,
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.640]   for example, you would just understand that
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:21.640]   as a configuration of a macromolecule
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:25.120]   to minimize its free energy, its thermodynamic free energy.
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.720]   It's exactly the same principle
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:27.720]   that we've been talking about,
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:31.260]   that thermodynamic free energy is just the negative elbow.
[00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.420]   It's the same mathematical construct.
[00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:38.720]   So the very emergence of existence of structure or form
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:41.280]   that can be distinguished from the environment
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.480]   or the thing that is not the thing
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:50.440]   necessitates the existence of an objective function
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:54.360]   that it looks as if it is minimizing.
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.520]   It's finding a free energy minima.
[00:10:56.520 --> 00:11:01.120]   - And so just to clarify, I'm trying to wrap my head around.
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:05.840]   So the free energy principle says that if something exists,
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.760]   these are the properties it should display.
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:13.640]   So what that means is we can't just look,
[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:17.280]   we can't just go into a soup and there's no mechanism.
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:19.680]   A free energy principle doesn't give us a mechanism
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.900]   to find the things that exist.
[00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:26.000]   Is that what's implying, is being implied
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.580]   that you can kind of use it to reason,
[00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:33.440]   to think about, like study a particular system
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:36.560]   and say, does this exhibit these qualities?
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.760]   - That's an excellent question.
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:42.160]   But to answer that, I'd have to return
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.760]   to your previous question about what's the difference
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.940]   between living and non-living things.
[00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:49.160]   - Yes, well, actually, sorry.
[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.400]   So yeah, maybe we can go there.
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.120]   You kind of drew a line,
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.920]   and forgive me for the stupid questions,
[00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:58.520]   but you kind of drew a line between living and existing.
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:01.760]   Is there an interesting sort of--
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:02.600]   - Distinction?
[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:03.420]   - Distinction between the two?
[00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:04.720]   - Yeah, I think there is.
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:10.560]   So things do exist, grains of sand,
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:15.440]   rocks on the moon, trees, you.
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:19.840]   So all of these things can be separated
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:22.280]   from the environment in which they are immersed,
[00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.160]   and therefore they must at some level
[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:27.280]   be optimizing their free energy.
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:32.160]   Taking this sort of model evidence interpretation
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.120]   of this quantity, that basically means
[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.960]   that self-evidencing, another nice little twist
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:41.480]   of phrase here is that you are your own existence proof,
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:46.160]   statistically speaking, which I don't think I said that.
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.020]   Somebody did, but I love that phrase.
[00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:51.600]   - You are your own existence proof.
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.040]   - Yeah, so it's so existential, isn't it?
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:57.480]   - I'm gonna have to think about that for a few days.
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:58.800]   (Lex laughing)
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:02.080]   So yeah, that's a beautiful line.
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:05.760]   So the step through to answer your question
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.560]   about what's it good for,
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:11.760]   we go along the following lines.
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:15.740]   First of all, you have to define what it means to exist,
[00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:18.040]   which now, as you've rightly pointed out,
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:21.000]   you have to define what probabilistic properties
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.440]   must the states of something possess
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:26.600]   so it knows where it finishes.
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.200]   And then you write that down
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.440]   in terms of statistical independences,
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:32.000]   again, sparsity.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.700]   Again, it's not what's connected or what's correlated
[00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:39.680]   or what depends upon what, it's what's not correlated
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:41.960]   and what doesn't depend upon something.
[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:45.680]   Again, it comes down to the deep structures,
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:46.920]   not in this instance hierarchical,
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:50.040]   but the structures that emerge
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:52.920]   from removing connectivity and dependency.
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:56.720]   And in this instance, basically being able to identify
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:00.440]   the surface of the oil drop from the water
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:02.520]   in which it is immersed.
[00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:05.160]   And when you do that, you start to realize,
[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:08.760]   well, there are actually four kinds of states
[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:11.720]   in any given universe that contains anything.
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:14.880]   The things that are internal to the surface,
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:16.720]   the things that are external to the surface
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:18.600]   and the surface in and of itself,
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.080]   which is why I use a metaphor,
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:21.480]   a little single-celled organism
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:23.120]   that has an interior and exterior
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:25.560]   and then the surface of the cell.
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:28.720]   And that's mathematically a Markov blanket.
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:30.960]   - Just to pause, I'm in awe of this concept
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.600]   that there's the stuff outside the surface,
[00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:34.960]   stuff inside the surface, and the surface itself,
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:36.240]   the Markov blanket.
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:39.720]   It's just the most beautiful kind of notion
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:43.040]   about trying to explore what it means to exist
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:43.920]   mathematically.
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:46.720]   I apologize, it's just a beautiful idea.
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:49.080]   - But it came out of California, so that's--
[00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:50.880]   - I changed my mind, I take it all back.
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:53.000]   (both laughing)
[00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.680]   - Anyway, so what you were just talking about,
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:57.320]   the surface, about the Markov blanket.
[00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:02.320]   - So the surface or these blanket states that are the,
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:08.240]   because they are now defined in relation to
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:15.720]   these independences and what different states,
[00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:18.800]   internal or blanket or external states,
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:21.320]   which ones can influence each other
[00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.800]   and which cannot influence each other.
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:27.000]   You can now apply standard results
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.640]   that you would find in non-equilibrium physics
[00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:33.920]   or steady state or thermodynamics or hydrodynamics,
[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:37.680]   usually out of equilibrium solutions
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:39.240]   and apply them to this partition.
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:44.160]   And what it looks like is if all the normal gradient flows
[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:48.120]   that you would associate with any non-equilibrium system
[00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:52.200]   apply in such a way that two,
[00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:55.080]   part of the Markov blanket and the internal states
[00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:59.760]   seem to be hill climbing or doing a gradient descent
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:01.880]   on the same quantity.
[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:05.400]   And that means that you can now describe
[00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:09.160]   the very existence of this oil drop.
[00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:12.040]   You can write down the existence of this oil drop
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:16.640]   in terms of flows, dynamics, equations of motion,
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:20.200]   where the blanket states or part of them,
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:24.080]   we call them active states and the internal states
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:27.880]   now seem to be, and must be,
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:31.520]   trying to look as if they're minimizing the same function,
[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:35.320]   which is a log probability of occupying these states.
[00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:36.620]   Interesting thing is that,
[00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:40.060]   what would they be called
[00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:41.720]   if you were trying to describe these things?
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:46.120]   So what we're talking about are internal states,
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:48.080]   external states and blanket states.
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:50.120]   Now let's carve the blanket states
[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:53.240]   into two sensory states and active states.
[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:55.560]   Operationally, it has to be the case
[00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:57.720]   that in order for this carving up
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:00.480]   into different sets of states to exist,
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:02.840]   the active states, the Markov blanket
[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:05.840]   cannot be influenced by the external states.
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:07.600]   And we already know that the internal states
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:09.680]   can't be influenced by the external states
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:11.760]   'cause the blanket separates them.
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:12.600]   So what does that mean?
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:15.320]   Well, it means the active states, the internal states
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:19.440]   are now jointly not influenced by external states.
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:22.160]   They only have autonomous dynamics.
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:26.040]   So now you've got a picture of an oil drop
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:27.880]   that has autonomy.
[00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.080]   It has autonomous states.
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:31.460]   It has autonomous states in the sense
[00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:33.600]   that there must be some parts of the surface
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:35.480]   of the oil drop that are not influenced
[00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:37.920]   by the external states and all the interior.
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:40.560]   And together those two states endow
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:43.680]   even a little oil drop with autonomous states
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:47.400]   that look as if they are optimizing
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:51.220]   their variational free energy or their negative elbow,
[00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:53.880]   their moral evidence.
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:59.240]   And that would be an interesting intellectual exercise.
[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:01.000]   And you could say, you could even go
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.600]   into the realms of panpsychism
[00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:05.440]   that everything that exists is implicitly
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:08.120]   making inferences on self-evidencing.
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:13.040]   Now we make the next move, but what about living things?
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:15.200]   I mean, so let me ask you,
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:17.600]   what's the difference between an oil drop
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:22.600]   and a little tadpole or a little larva or a plankton?
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:25.720]   - The picture was just painted of an oil drop.
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:28.840]   Just immediately in a matter of minutes
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:31.200]   took me into the world of panpsychism
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:34.040]   where you just convinced me,
[00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:37.240]   made me feel like an oil drop is a living,
[00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:39.400]   certainly an autonomous system,
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:40.720]   but almost a living system.
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:43.760]   So it has a capability, sensory capabilities
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:46.640]   and acting capabilities and it maintains something.
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:49.960]   So what is the difference between that
[00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:52.360]   and something that we traditionally think
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:53.700]   of as a living system?
[00:18:53.700 --> 00:19:00.000]   That it could die or it can't, I mean, yeah, mortality.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.280]   I'm not exactly sure.
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:03.440]   I'm not sure what the right answer there is
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:06.720]   because it can move, like movement seems
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:08.880]   like an essential element to being able to act
[00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:11.840]   in the environment, but the oil drop is doing that.
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:12.680]   So I don't know.
[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:14.160]   - Is it?
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:15.760]   The oil drop will be moved,
[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:18.680]   but does it in and of itself move autonomously?
[00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:22.880]   - Well, the surface is performing actions
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:25.720]   that maintain its structure.
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:26.840]   - Yeah, you're being too clever.
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:30.560]   I was, I didn't find a passive little oil drop
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:33.720]   that's sitting there at the bottom
[00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:35.280]   of the top of a glass of water.
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:36.600]   - Sure, I guess.
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:38.240]   - What I'm trying to say is you're absolutely right.
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:40.400]   You've nailed it.
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:41.880]   It's movement.
[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:43.160]   So where does that movement come from?
[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:45.400]   If it comes from the inside,
[00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:48.000]   then you've got, I think, something that's living.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.640]   - What do you mean from the inside?
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:54.840]   - What I mean is that the internal states
[00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:57.080]   that can influence the active states,
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:58.640]   where the active states can influence,
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:01.200]   but they're not influenced by the external states,
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.200]   can cause movement.
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:06.480]   So there are two types of oil drops, if you like.
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:08.840]   There are oil drops where the internal states
[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:13.840]   are so random that they average themselves away.
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:19.840]   And the thing cannot balance on average
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:22.000]   when you do the averaging move.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.200]   So a nice example of that would be the sun.
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:27.200]   The sun certainly has internal states.
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:30.400]   There's lots of intrinsic autonomous activity going on,
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:31.880]   but because it's not coordinated,
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:34.120]   because it doesn't have the deep in the millennial sense,
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:37.040]   the hierarchical structure that the brain does,
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:41.880]   there is no overall mode or pattern or organization
[00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:44.240]   that expresses itself on the surface
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:46.160]   that allows it to actually swim.
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:50.160]   It can certainly have a very active surface,
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:54.320]   but on mass, at the scale of the actual surface of the sun,
[00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:59.000]   the average position of that surface cannot in itself move
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.760]   because the internal dynamics are more like a hot gas.
[00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:04.520]   They are literally like a hot gas.
[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:07.480]   Whereas your internal dynamics are much more structured
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:08.960]   and deeply structured.
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:11.520]   And now you can express on your Markov
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.440]   and your active states with your muscles
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.800]   and your secretory organs,
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:19.000]   your autonomic nervous system and its effectors,
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.560]   you can actually move.
[00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:22.840]   And that's all you can do.
[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:24.320]   And that's something which,
[00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:26.480]   if you haven't thought of it like this before,
[00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:29.920]   I think it's nice to just realize there is no other way
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.320]   that you can change the universe other than simply moving.
[00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:39.920]   Whether that movement is articulating with my voice box
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:42.680]   or walking around or squeezing juices
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:44.800]   out of my secretory organs,
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:48.040]   there's only one way you can change the universe,
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:48.920]   it's moving.
[00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:53.920]   - And the fact that you do so non-randomly makes you alive.
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:55.560]   - Yeah.
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:56.920]   So it's that non-randomness.
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:00.840]   And that would be manifest,
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:03.880]   it would be realized in terms of essentially swimming,
[00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:06.560]   essentially moving, changing one shape,
[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:10.680]   a morphogenesis that is dynamic and possibly adaptive.
[00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:14.000]   So that's what I was trying to get at
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.280]   between the difference from the oil drop
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:16.640]   and the little tadpole.
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:19.080]   The tadpole is moving around,
[00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:23.040]   its active states are actually changing the external states.
[00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:24.560]   And there's now a cycle,
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:26.480]   an action perception cycle, if you like,
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:30.080]   a recurrent dynamic that's going on
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:35.080]   that depends upon this deeply structured autonomous behavior
[00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:40.440]   that rests upon internal dynamics
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:45.680]   that are not only modeling the data
[00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:49.880]   impressed upon their surface or the blanket states,
[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:54.880]   but they are actively resampling those data by moving.
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:58.600]   They're moving towards say chemical gradients and chemotaxis.
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:04.360]   So they've gone beyond just being good little models
[00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:07.160]   of the kind of world they live in.
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:12.040]   For example, an oil droplet could in a panpsychic sense
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:14.520]   be construed as a little being
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:16.800]   that has now perfectly inferred
[00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:19.880]   it's a passive non-living oil drop
[00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:21.720]   living in a bowl of water.
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:22.560]   No problem.
[00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:25.960]   But to now equip that oil drop
[00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:28.520]   with the ability to go out and test that hypothesis
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:30.120]   about different states of beings.
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:33.000]   So it can actually push its surface over there, over there,
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.760]   and test for chemical gradients,
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:38.760]   or then you start to move to much more lifelike form.
[00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:41.040]   Now this is all fun, theoretically interesting,
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:43.080]   but it actually is quite important
[00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:45.920]   in terms of reflecting what I have seen
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:49.240]   since the turn of the millennium,
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:52.720]   which is this move towards an inactive
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:55.840]   and embodied understanding of intelligence.
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:58.840]   And you say you're from machine learning.
[00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:01.840]   So what that means,
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:05.600]   this sort of the central importance of movement,
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:10.040]   I think has yet to really hit machine learning.
[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:15.040]   It certainly has now diffused itself throughout robotics.
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:19.260]   And perhaps you could say certain problems in active vision
[00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:21.440]   where you actually have to move the camera
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:23.320]   to sample this and that.
[00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:26.280]   But machine learning of the data mining,
[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:27.680]   deep learning sort,
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:30.080]   simply hasn't contended with this issue.
[00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:32.000]   What it's done, instead of dealing
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.240]   with the movement problem and the active sampling of data,
[00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:36.760]   it's just said, we don't need to worry about it,
[00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:39.200]   we can see all the data 'cause we've got big data.
[00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:41.200]   So we can ignore movement.
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:46.200]   So that for me is an important omission
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:48.280]   in current machine learning.
[00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:49.200]   - So current machine learning
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:50.880]   is much more like the oil drop.
[00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:52.040]   - Yes.
[00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:55.560]   But an oil drop that enjoys exposure
[00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:59.680]   to nearly all the data that we need to be exposed to,
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:01.840]   as opposed to the tadpoles swimming out
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:03.440]   to find the right data.
[00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:06.360]   For example, it likes food.
[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:07.320]   That's a good hypothesis.
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:08.160]   Let's test it out.
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:11.680]   Let's go and move and ingest food, for example,
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:12.840]   and see what that, you know,
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:14.640]   is that evidence that I'm the kind of thing
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:16.360]   that likes this kind of food.
[00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:18.680]   - So the next natural question,
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:19.960]   and forgive this question,
[00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:22.160]   but if we think of sort of even
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:23.600]   artificial intelligence systems,
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:25.400]   which has just painted a beautiful picture
[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:28.760]   of existence and life.
[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:33.760]   So do you ascribe,
[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:37.040]   do you find within this framework a possibility
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:41.200]   of defining consciousness
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:43.320]   or exploring the idea of consciousness?
[00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:48.320]   Like what, you know, self-awareness
[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:51.080]   and expanded to consciousness?
[00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:52.160]   Yeah.
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:54.840]   How can we start to think about consciousness
[00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:55.720]   within this framework?
[00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:56.840]   Is it possible?
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:59.160]   - Well, yeah, I think it's possible to think about it,
[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.000]   whether you'll get it.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.360]   - Get it, you heard it, it's another question.
[00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:06.320]   - And again, I'm not sure that I'm licensed
[00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:08.720]   to answer that question.
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:11.120]   I think you'd have to speak to a qualified philosopher
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:13.320]   to get a definitive answer there.
[00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:15.640]   But certainly there's a lot of interest
[00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:17.720]   in using not just these ideas,
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:21.840]   but related ideas from information theory
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:26.480]   to try and tie down the maths and the calculus
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:30.040]   and the geometry of consciousness,
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:35.040]   either in terms of sort of a minimal consciousness,
[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:38.360]   even less than a minimal selfhood.
[00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:43.040]   And what I'm talking about is the ability effectively
[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:47.320]   to plan, to have agency.
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:53.360]   So you could argue that a virus does have a form of agency
[00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:58.160]   in virtue of the way that it selectively finds hosts
[00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:00.920]   and cells to live in and moves around.
[00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:05.240]   But you wouldn't endow it with the capacity
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:10.240]   to think about planning and moving in a purposeful way
[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:13.240]   where it countenances the future.
[00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:16.680]   Whereas you might think an ant's not quite
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:20.240]   as unconscious as a virus.
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:22.160]   It certainly seems to have a purpose.
[00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:25.640]   It talks to its friends en route during its foraging.
[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:30.640]   It has a different kind of autonomy,
[00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:34.720]   which is biotic, but beyond a virus.
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:36.480]   - So there's something about,
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:39.160]   so there's some line that has to do
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:41.640]   with the complexity of planning
[00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:43.960]   that may contain an answer.
[00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:47.520]   I mean, it would be beautiful if we can find a line
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:51.480]   beyond which we can say a being is conscious.
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:52.320]   - Yes, it would be.
[00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:55.160]   - These are wonderful lines that we've drawn
[00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:58.640]   with existence, life, and consciousness.
[00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:01.280]   - Yes, it would be very nice.
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:03.160]   One little wrinkle there,
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:04.480]   and this is something I've only learned
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:05.360]   in the past few months,
[00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:08.360]   is the philosophical notion of vagueness.
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:10.800]   So you're saying it would be wonderful to draw a line.
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:13.520]   I had always assumed that that line
[00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:15.000]   at some point would be drawn,
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.680]   until about four months ago,
[00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:20.840]   and a philosopher taught me about vagueness.
[00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:22.200]   So I don't know if you've come across this,
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:24.400]   but it's a technical concept,
[00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:29.080]   and I think most revealingly illustrated
[00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:33.040]   with at what point does a pile of sand become a pile?
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:37.560]   Is it one grain, two grains, three grains, or four grains?
[00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:40.200]   So at what point would you draw the line
[00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:42.240]   between being a pile of sand
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:47.240]   and a collection of grains of sand?
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:49.520]   In the same way, is it right to ask,
[00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:50.760]   where would I draw the line
[00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:52.680]   between conscious and unconscious?
[00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:55.640]   And it might be a vague concept.
[00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:57.440]   Having said that, I agree with you entirely.
[00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:02.440]   I think it's systems that have the ability to plan.
[00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:04.400]   So just technically what that means
[00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:09.400]   is your inferential self-evidencing
[00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:13.240]   by which I simply mean the dynamics,
[00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:16.320]   literally the thermodynamics and gradient flows
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:18.280]   that underwrite the preservation
[00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:20.160]   of your oil droplet-like form
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:24.600]   are described as a,
[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:26.320]   can be described as an optimization
[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:30.360]   of log Bayesian model evidence, your elbow.
[00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:37.400]   That self-evidencing must be evidence for a model
[00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:40.000]   of what's causing the sensory impressions
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.360]   on the sensory part of your surface
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:44.440]   or your Markov blanket.
[00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:47.120]   If that model is capable of planning,
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:49.800]   it must include a model of the future consequences
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:52.760]   of your active states or your action, just planning.
[00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:55.360]   So we're now in the game of planning as inference.
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:56.600]   Now notice what we've made though.
[00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:58.640]   We've made quite a big move away
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:01.200]   from big data and machine learning,
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:04.440]   because again, it's the consequences of moving.
[00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:07.080]   It's the consequences of selecting those data
[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:10.200]   or those data or looking over there.
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:14.320]   And that tells you immediately that even to be a contender
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:16.080]   for a conscious artifact or a,
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:20.120]   is it strong AI or generalized?
[00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:20.960]   - Generalized, yeah.
[00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:22.720]   - It's called now.
[00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:25.240]   Then you've got to have movement in the game.
[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:28.520]   And furthermore, you've got to have a generative model
[00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:31.880]   of the sort you might find in say a variational autoencoder
[00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:35.840]   that is thinking about the future conditioned
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:37.880]   upon different courses of action.
[00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:39.800]   Now that brings a number of things to the table,
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:41.320]   which now you start to think,
[00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:43.400]   well, those who've got all the right ingredients
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:44.480]   talk about consciousness.
[00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:46.680]   I've now got to select among a number
[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:49.280]   of different courses of action into the future
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:50.880]   as part of planning.
[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:52.400]   I've now got free will.
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:54.640]   The act of selecting this course of action
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:57.280]   or that policy or that policy or that action
[00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:00.680]   suddenly makes me into an inference machine,
[00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:05.680]   a self-evidencing artifact that now looks
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:08.800]   as if it's selecting amongst different alternative ways
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:11.480]   forward as I actively swim here or swim there
[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:13.920]   or look over here, look over there.
[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:15.920]   So I think you've now got to a situation
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:18.200]   if there is planning in the mix,
[00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:21.200]   you're now getting much closer to that line,
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:23.320]   if that line were ever to exist.
[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:26.600]   I don't think it gets you quite as far as self-aware though.
[00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:32.400]   I think, and then you have to, I think,
[00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:34.160]   grapple with the question,
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:38.560]   how would formally you write down a calculus
[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:40.560]   or a maths of self-awareness?
[00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:42.400]   I don't think it's impossible to do,
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:47.560]   but I think there'll be pressure on you
[00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:49.200]   to actually commit to a formal definition
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:51.840]   of what you mean by self-awareness.
[00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:56.680]   I think most people that I know would probably say
[00:31:56.680 --> 00:32:01.680]   that a goldfish, a pet fish was not self-aware.
[00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:05.560]   They would probably argue about their favorite cat,
[00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:08.200]   but would be quite happy to say
[00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:10.000]   that their mom was self-aware.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.320]   So- - I mean, but that might
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:16.880]   very well connect to some level of complexity with planning.
[00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:19.600]   It seems like self-awareness is essential
[00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:23.240]   for complex planning. - Yeah.
[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:24.080]   Do you want to take that further?
[00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:25.320]   'Cause I think you're absolutely right.
[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:27.120]   - Again, the line is unclear,
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:30.680]   but it seems like integrating yourself
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:35.160]   into the world, into your planning
[00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:38.280]   is essential for constructing complex plans.
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:39.720]   - Yes, yeah.
[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:41.920]   - So mathematically describing that
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:44.640]   in the same elegant way as you have
[00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:47.120]   with the free energy principle might be difficult.
[00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:49.280]   - Well, yes and no.
[00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:51.320]   I don't think that, well, perhaps we should just,
[00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:53.000]   can we just go back?
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.680]   That's a very important answer you gave.
[00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:57.840]   And I think if I just unpacked it,
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:01.680]   you'd see the truisms that you've just exposed for us.
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:05.720]   But let me, sorry, I'm mindful
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:07.360]   that I didn't answer your question before.
[00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:09.840]   Well, what's the free energy principle good for?
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:11.640]   Is it just a pretty theoretical exercise
[00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:13.880]   to explain non-equilibrium steady states?
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:15.320]   Yes, it is.
[00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:17.320]   It does nothing more for you than that.
[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:20.040]   It can be regarded, it's gonna sound very arrogant,
[00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:23.840]   but it is of the sort of theory of natural selection
[00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:28.720]   or a hypothesis of natural selection.
[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:32.480]   Beautiful, undeniably true,
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:35.560]   but tells you absolutely nothing about
[00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:38.040]   why you have legs and eyes.
[00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:40.720]   It tells you nothing about the actual phenotype
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:44.080]   and it wouldn't allow you to build something.
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:47.080]   So the free energy principle by itself
[00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:50.880]   is as vacuous as most tautological theories.
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:52.200]   And by tautological, of course,
[00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:54.800]   I'm talking to the theory of natural,
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:56.080]   the survival of the fittest.
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:57.720]   What's the fittest that survive?
[00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:59.040]   Why do the cycles, the fitter?
[00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:00.720]   It just go round in circles.
[00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:03.000]   In a sense, the free energy principle
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:07.480]   has that same deflationary tautology under the hood.
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:13.680]   It's a characteristic of things that exist.
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:14.520]   Why do they exist?
[00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:15.720]   Because they minimize their free energy.
[00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:17.400]   Why do they minimize their free energy?
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:18.440]   Because they exist.
[00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:20.720]   And you just keep on going round and round and round.
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:24.080]   But the practical thing,
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:28.680]   which you don't get from natural selection,
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:31.680]   but you could say has now manifest in things
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:34.160]   like differential evolution or genetic algorithms
[00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:37.320]   or MCMC, for example, in machine learning.
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:39.200]   The practical thing you can get is,
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:41.440]   if it looks as if things that exist
[00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:45.400]   are trying to have density dynamics
[00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:47.560]   that look as though they're optimizing
[00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:49.320]   a variation of free energy,
[00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:51.200]   and a variation of free energy has to be
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:53.280]   a functional of a generative model,
[00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:57.720]   a probabilistic description of causes and consequences,
[00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:00.560]   causes out there, consequences in the sensorium,
[00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:03.040]   on the sensory parts of the Markov Planckian,
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:04.680]   then it should, in theory, be possible
[00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:06.400]   to write down the generative model,
[00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:07.800]   work out the gradients,
[00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:11.920]   and then cause it to autonomously self-evidence.
[00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:14.160]   So you should be able to write down oil droplets.
[00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:16.080]   You should be able to create artifacts
[00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:20.240]   where you have supplied the objective function
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:21.600]   that supplies the gradients,
[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:24.360]   that supplies the self-organizing dynamics
[00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:26.280]   to non-equilibrium steady state.
[00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:28.680]   So there is actually a practical application
[00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:30.120]   of the free energy principle
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:33.800]   when you can write down your required evidence
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:36.400]   in terms of, well, when you can write down
[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:37.640]   the generative model,
[00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:40.800]   that is the thing that has the evidence,
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:44.520]   the probability of these sensory data or this data,
[00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:48.960]   given that model is effectively the thing
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:51.640]   that the ELBO, or the Variational Free Energy,
[00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:54.240]   bounds or approximates.
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:57.720]   That means that you can actually write down the model,
[00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:00.640]   and the kind of thing that you want to engineer,
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:03.920]   the kind of AGI, or Artificial General Intelligence,
[00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:10.480]   that you want to manifest probabilistically,
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:12.720]   and then you engineer, a lot of hard work,
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:15.760]   but you would engineer a robot and a computer
[00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:19.400]   to perform a gradient descent on that objective function.
[00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:22.160]   So it does have a practical implication.
[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:23.440]   Now, why am I wittering on about that?
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:24.880]   It did seem relevant to, yes.
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:28.920]   So, what kinds of, so the answer to,
[00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:30.240]   would it be easy or would it be hard?
[00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:32.160]   Well, mathematically, it's easy.
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:34.880]   I've just told you, all you need to do is write down
[00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:39.880]   your perfect artifact probabilistically
[00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:42.480]   in the form of a probabilistic generative model,
[00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:45.840]   probability distribution over the causes and consequences
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:50.680]   of the world in which this thing is immersed.
[00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:54.040]   And then you just engineer a computer and a robot
[00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:56.800]   to perform a gradient descent on that objective function.
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:57.640]   No problem.
[00:36:57.640 --> 00:37:00.160]   But of course, the big problem
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:01.960]   is writing down the generative model.
[00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:04.040]   So that's where the heavy lifting comes in.
[00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:08.160]   So it's the form and the structure of that generative model,
[00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:11.640]   which basically defines the artifact that you will create,
[00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:15.600]   or indeed, the kind of artifact that has self-awareness.
[00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:17.960]   So that's where all the hard work comes,
[00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:20.640]   very much like natural selection doesn't tell you
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:23.000]   in the slightest why you have eyes.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.480]   So you have to drill down on the actual phenotype,
[00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:27.480]   the actual generative model.
[00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:32.360]   So with that in mind, what did you tell me
[00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:36.720]   that tells me immediately the kinds of generative models
[00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:39.480]   I would have to write down in order to have self-awareness?
[00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:44.200]   - What you said to me was, I have to have a model
[00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:47.840]   that is effectively fit for purpose for this kind of world
[00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:49.680]   in which I operate.
[00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:53.160]   And if I now make the observation that this kind of world
[00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:56.560]   is effectively largely populated by other things like me,
[00:37:56.560 --> 00:38:00.200]   i.e. you, then it makes enormous sense
[00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:03.280]   that if I can develop a hypothesis
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:07.520]   that we are similar kinds of creatures,
[00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:09.640]   in fact, the same kind of creature,
[00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:12.320]   but I am me and you are you,
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:17.320]   then it becomes, again, mandated to have a sense of self.
[00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:21.280]   So if I live in a world that is constituted
[00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:25.520]   by things like me, basically a social world, a community,
[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:28.320]   then it becomes necessary now for me to infer
[00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:30.400]   that it's me talking and not you talking.
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:33.280]   I wouldn't need that if I was on Mars by myself,
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:36.040]   or if I was in the jungle as a feral child.
[00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:39.120]   If there was nothing like me around,
[00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:42.480]   there would be no need to have an inference,
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:46.120]   a hypothesis, ah, yes, it is me that is experiencing
[00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:48.360]   or causing these sounds, and it is not you.
[00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:50.680]   It's only when there's ambiguity in play
[00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:54.240]   induced by the fact that there are others in that world.
[00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:59.240]   So I think that the special thing about self-aware artifacts
[00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:04.280]   is that they have learned to, or they have acquired,
[00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:07.680]   or at least are equipped with, possibly by evolution,
[00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:10.600]   generative models that allow for the fact
[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:13.360]   there are lots of copies of things like them around,
[00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:16.160]   and therefore they have to work out it's you and not me.
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:19.280]   - That's brilliant.
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:20.560]   I've never thought of that.
[00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:24.440]   I never thought of that, that the purpose of,
[00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:29.000]   the really usefulness of consciousness or self-awareness
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.920]   in the context of planning existing in the world
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:34.360]   is so you can operate with other things like you.
[00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:36.800]   And like you could, it doesn't have to necessarily be human.
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:39.480]   It could be other kind of similar creatures.
[00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:42.080]   - Absolutely, well, we imbue a lot of our attributes
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:43.840]   into our pets, don't we?
[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:45.880]   Or we try to make our robots humanoid.
[00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:47.840]   And I think there's a deep reason for that,
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:50.680]   that it's just much easier to read the world
[00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:52.220]   if you can make the simplifying assumption
[00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:55.280]   that basically you're me, and it's just your turn to talk.
[00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:57.520]   I mean, when we talk about planning,
[00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:00.200]   when you talk specifically about planning,
[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:03.800]   the highest, if you like, manifestation or realization
[00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:05.600]   of that planning is what we're doing now.
[00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:08.560]   I mean, the human condition doesn't get any higher
[00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:12.800]   than this talking about the philosophy of existence
[00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:13.900]   and the conversation.
[00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:17.740]   But in that conversation, there is a beautiful art
[00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:24.080]   of turn-taking and mutual inference, theory of mind.
[00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:25.640]   I have to know when you want to listen.
[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:27.080]   I have to know when you want to interrupt.
[00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:28.480]   I have to make sure that you're online.
[00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:30.360]   I have to have a model in my head
[00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:31.800]   of your model in your head.
[00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:34.320]   That's the highest, the most sophisticated form
[00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:36.160]   of generative model, where the generative model
[00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:37.360]   actually has a generative model
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:38.800]   of somebody else's generative model.
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:41.800]   And I think that, and what we are doing now,
[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:45.160]   evinces the kinds of generative models
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:47.260]   that would support self-awareness.
[00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:50.640]   'Cause without that, we'd both be talking over each other,
[00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:54.320]   or we'd be singing together in a choir, you know?
[00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:56.560]   That was just probably not, that's not a brilliant analogy
[00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:58.720]   what I'm trying to say, but yeah,
[00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:01.160]   we wouldn't have this discourse.
[00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:03.680]   - Yeah, the dance of it, yeah, that's right.
[00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:06.500]   As I interrupt. (laughs)
[00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:09.240]   I mean, that's beautifully put.
[00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:11.800]   I'll re-listen to this conversation many times.
[00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:17.640]   There's so much poetry in this, and mathematics.
[00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:22.280]   Let me ask the silliest, or perhaps the biggest question
[00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:24.900]   as a last kind of question.
[00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:29.360]   We've talked about living in existence
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:31.160]   and the objective function under which
[00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:33.520]   these objects would operate.
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:35.760]   What do you think is the objective function
[00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:37.560]   of our existence?
[00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:39.360]   What's the meaning of life?
[00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:43.180]   What do you think is the, for you perhaps,
[00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:46.240]   the purpose, the source of fulfillment,
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:49.120]   the source of meaning for your existence?
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:52.360]   As one blob. - As one blob.
[00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:53.680]   - In this soup.
[00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:56.520]   - I'm tempted to answer that again as a physicist.
[00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:57.720]   (laughs)
[00:41:57.720 --> 00:42:01.480]   Free energy I expect consequent upon my behavior.
[00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:03.160]   So technically that, and we could get
[00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:05.680]   a really interesting conversation about
[00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:09.160]   what that comprises in terms of searching for information,
[00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:12.560]   resolving uncertainty about the kind of thing that I am.
[00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:16.240]   But I suspect that you want a slightly more personal
[00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:17.220]   and fun answer.
[00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:21.120]   But which can be consistent with that.
[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:26.120]   And I think it's reassuringly simple
[00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:31.440]   and harps back to what you were taught as a child,
[00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:35.520]   that you have certain beliefs about the kind of creature
[00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:37.840]   and the kind of person you are.
[00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:40.840]   And all that self-evidencing means,
[00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:42.840]   all that minimizing variational free energy
[00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:46.020]   in an inactive and embodied way,
[00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:48.720]   means is fulfilling the beliefs
[00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:51.720]   about what kind of thing you are.
[00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:54.040]   And of course we're all given those scripts,
[00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:57.240]   those narratives at a very early age,
[00:42:57.240 --> 00:43:00.420]   usually in the form of bedtime stories or fairy stories.
[00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:03.160]   I'm a princess and I'm gonna meet a beast
[00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:05.800]   who's gonna transform and it's gonna be a prince.
[00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:07.860]   - So the narratives are all around you,
[00:43:07.860 --> 00:43:10.540]   from your parents to the friends,
[00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:13.680]   to the society feeds these stories.
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:17.000]   And then your objective function is to fulfill--
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.240]   - Exactly, that narrative that has been encultured
[00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:22.240]   by your immediate family,
[00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:24.440]   but as you say also the sort of the culture
[00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:26.880]   in which you grew up and you create for yourself.
[00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:29.440]   I mean, again, because of this active inference,
[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:32.040]   this inactive aspect of self-evidencing,
[00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:36.940]   not only am I modeling my environment,
[00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:40.040]   my econish, my external states out there,
[00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:42.520]   but I'm actively changing them all the time.
[00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:44.960]   And external states are doing the same back,
[00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:45.800]   we're doing it together.
[00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:48.800]   So there's a synchrony that means
[00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:50.800]   that I'm creating my own culture
[00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:52.800]   over different timescales.
[00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:56.780]   So the question now is for me being very selfish,
[00:43:56.780 --> 00:43:58.240]   what scripts were I given?
[00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:02.120]   It basically was a mixture between Einstein and Sherlock Holmes.
[00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:04.800]   So I smoke as heavily as possible,
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:08.520]   try to avoid too much interpersonal contact,
[00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:16.280]   enjoy the fantasy that you're a popular scientist
[00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:19.360]   who's gonna make a difference in a slightly quirky way.
[00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:21.160]   So that's where I grew up.
[00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:24.280]   My father was an engineer and loved science
[00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:29.280]   and he loved sort of things like Sir Arthur Eddington's
[00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:30.480]   Space, Time and Gravitation,
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:34.800]   which was the first understandable version
[00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:36.760]   of general relativity.
[00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:40.840]   So all the fairy stories I was told
[00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:43.680]   as I was growing up were all about these characters.
[00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:46.600]   I'm keeping the Hobbit out of this
[00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:49.160]   because that doesn't quite fit my narrative.
[00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:52.240]   But it's a journey of exploration, I suppose, of sorts.
[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:54.200]   So yeah, I've just grown up to be
[00:44:54.200 --> 00:45:00.560]   what I imagine a mild-mannered Sherlock Holmes/Albert Einstein
[00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:04.000]   would do in my shoes.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.520]   - And you did it elegantly and beautifully, Carl.
[00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:07.920]   It was a huge honor talking to you today.
[00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:08.760]   It was fun.
[00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:09.600]   Thank you so much for your time.
[00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:10.800]   - Oh, thank you. - Appreciate it.
[00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:14.240]   (upbeat music)
[00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:16.840]   (upbeat music)
[00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:19.440]   (upbeat music)
[00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:22.040]   (upbeat music)
[00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:24.640]   (upbeat music)
[00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:27.240]   (upbeat music)
[00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:37.240]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
