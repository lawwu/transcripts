[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.220]   Most of you will recall that we are looking at the present time at the words which are
[00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:13.360]   to be found in Paul's epistle to the Romans in chapter 8 and in verse 14, "For as many
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:20.440]   as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God."
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:29.040]   Now, I reminded you last Friday evening that this is an introduction of a new theme, namely
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:37.640]   our sonship of God, and that the Apostle introduces it in order to give us yet further ground
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.040]   for our assurance of salvation.
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.400]   That is the basic theme.
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:51.960]   That's what he is really setting out to prove, that in Christ Jesus our ultimate, full, and
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.640]   final salvation is something which is guaranteed.
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:07.200]   And he has been giving us various reasons for knowing this and for realizing this.
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.520]   And here he comes to this new grounds of assurance, our sonship.
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:20.760]   Now, we've been looking at this, we've started looking at this great notion, this great idea
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.760]   that we are the sons of God.
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:30.060]   We emphasize that, obviously, from this statement alone, that not all people are the sons of
[00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.060]   God.
[00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:39.360]   As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God, and nobody else.
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.960]   And then we emphasize the positive side, that we are the sons of God.
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:50.040]   Now, that's the thing the Apostle really wants us to lay hold of, this most wonderful
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.360]   and amazing truth, that though we are still left on this earth and though the many things
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:07.400]   that are true of us are true, that nevertheless we are the sons or the children of God.
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:13.840]   And then we ended by just beginning to look at this meaning of this term "sonship."
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.840]   What does it mean?
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.800]   And we saw that it meant that we've been adopted by God, adopted into the family of
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.800]   God.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:28.340]   We were all by nature the children of Rock, the children of Adam, but now we have been
[00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.120]   adopted into the family of God.
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.000]   And more than that, we have been born again, we've been given a new life, a new nature.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.080]   We are partakers of the divine nature.
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:47.200]   Now, there is the beginning of an understanding of what it means to be a son or a child of
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.320]   God.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:58.960]   But we must continue now by considering what this term "sonship" connotes and includes
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.880]   in addition to that.
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:08.800]   That is really the adoption and the rebirth are really an account of how we become sons.
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:15.200]   And we must look, therefore, more closely at what this sonship implies, what it means
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.800]   concerning us.
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:23.280]   And the first thing we have to notice is this, that it involves the whole notion of similarity,
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.200]   a likeness.
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.960]   Now this is something that is true, of course, on the natural level, isn't it?
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:39.080]   The son and the father have similarities, they are alike, this kinship of theirs in
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:45.600]   the matter of blood leads to certain likenesses, certain things which they have in common,
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.640]   a likeness of nature.
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:53.080]   And that is true, this is one of the wonderful aspects of this matter, of our relationship
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:58.960]   to God as his sons, as his children.
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:07.760]   And it means, of course, that there is a likeness and a similarity of mind and of outlook.
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.880]   That is one of the characteristics of the sonship.
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.720]   I shall be dealing with that in detail in a moment.
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.440]   But we've got to note it at this point.
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:25.720]   As sons of God, we are now looking at things from God's standpoint, from the aspect of
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.400]   eternity.
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.960]   We were not doing that before, but now we do that.
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:37.680]   You remember that this same apostle in writing to the Ephesians puts this in a very, very
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:43.940]   striking manner at the end of the second chapter of that first epistle to the Corinthians.
[00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:50.960]   He says this, he says, "He that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:51.960]   of no man.
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:57.000]   For who hath known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him?"
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.640]   And then this extraordinary statement, "But we have the mind of Christ."
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:11.160]   Now, that's the kind of thing that I mean at this moment, that as sons of God, we, as
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:22.880]   it were, have this mind, this outlook of God, the mind of Christ, the Son, becomes our mind.
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:28.200]   And it's a very striking and important part of this sonship.
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:34.220]   But then, of course, it includes also a similarity and a likeness in the matter of behavior.
[00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:39.360]   Now, this is something which is taught in many parts of the Scripture.
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.800]   You get our Lord teaching it, for instance, in the Sermon on the Mount at the end of the
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:50.520]   fifth chapter of the Gospel according to St. Matthew, where he is talking about loving
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.280]   your enemies and blessing them that curse you.
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:59.900]   Verse 44, "I say unto you, love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them
[00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:06.360]   that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you, that in order that
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:12.040]   ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven.
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:17.600]   For he maketh his Son to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.640]   and on the unjust.
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.560]   For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye?
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.240]   Do not even the publicans the same?
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.840]   And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others?
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.040]   Do not even the publicans so?
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:38.280]   Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect."
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:43.320]   Now, that's a primary reference, of course, to the way in which we love our enemies and
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.480]   so on.
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:50.080]   And our Lord's exhortation is this, that as our Father has done that with us and does
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.340]   it with others, so we should.
[00:06:53.340 --> 00:07:02.760]   So the Sonship involves a likeness, a similarity, in the whole outlook and in conduct and in
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:03.760]   behaviour.
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:09.640]   Now, this is something, of course, which is quite endless.
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:15.440]   This is the grand motive for holy, sanctified living.
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:19.600]   This is the great appeal for sanctified, holy living.
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.440]   Not that we may be happy or that we may have a victory over something.
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.400]   That's a very low way of putting it.
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:29.440]   The way to put it is this, that we are to be children of our Father.
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:35.720]   "Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works, but glorify your
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:39.240]   Father which is in heaven."
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:47.600]   Our walk, our conversation, is to be of a type and of a kind that it is reminiscent
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.840]   of God himself, loving our enemies and all these things.
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:56.520]   And you notice that phrase which I read to you from the beginning there of the fifth
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:02.160]   chapter of Paul's epistle to the Ephesians, where again he doesn't hesitate to put it
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:09.240]   in those self-same terms, that it is, "As dear children, be ye therefore followers of
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.240]   God."
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:17.800]   "As dear children, and walk in love as Christ also hath loved us."
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:23.880]   Now that's what I'm trying to say, that the similarity and the likeness, indeed, are to
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:31.680]   cover the whole of our existence and being and activity, outlook, understanding, conduct,
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:32.680]   behavior.
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:37.200]   There it is in an all-inclusive manner.
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:45.080]   But in addition to involving the notion of similarity, the idea of sonship clearly carries
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:51.440]   certain other ideas as well, and I know of nothing that's more comforting and consoling
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:55.600]   than to work out these other aspects of our sonship.
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:03.160]   Look, for instance, at what it involves and implies concerning God's relationship to us.
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:07.440]   Is there anything more important for us than to know this?
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:15.080]   Look here, says Paul, so many of you as are led by the Spirit of God, you are sons of
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.080]   God.
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:21.880]   In other words, you're not merely forgiven, you are forgiven, but it isn't that only.
[00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:24.400]   You are sons of God, you're children of God.
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.840]   Why does he emphasize this?
[00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:31.160]   Why is it so important that we should emphasize it and we should all be clear about it?
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:38.880]   Well, this is a way of saying, as nothing else can say it, that God loves us, and loves
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:43.320]   us in a peculiar and a special manner.
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:47.440]   Now we know that God causeth his Son to rise on the evil and the good, and sendeth his
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:50.000]   reign on the just and the unjust.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:56.280]   But you cannot say that God loves the whole of humanity in the same way as he loves those
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.640]   who are his sons.
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:05.040]   He may manifest his benignity to all, and he does, in his kindly providence.
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:11.360]   But here is the vital distinction, the distinction between God's general attitude towards the
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:18.800]   whole of mankind, and his peculiar, special attitude towards his own children, his sons.
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:25.760]   Now, again, the human analogy conveys the idea to us obviously and at once, whereas
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:31.600]   it is our business and our duty to be kindly disposed towards everybody, and be ready to
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.320]   help everybody.
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:41.900]   It is right that there should be something special and additional in the case of those
[00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:45.200]   who belong to us and who are our own family.
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:49.600]   You've got the same idea taught by Paul in writing to the Galatians, where he says, "Do
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:54.680]   good unto all men, especially those," he says, "who are of the household of faith."
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:58.120]   Especially, that's it, especially.
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:04.440]   You don't expect a person to treat all children in the way he treats his own children.
[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:10.160]   He is to be kind and good to all, but because of the relationship there is something additional,
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.840]   there is something special and peculiar.
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:19.160]   And what we are being reminded of is, in other words, that as God's children, his love to
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:25.040]   us is something which is special and peculiar.
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:26.040]   How does it show?
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:31.440]   Well, in a special interest in us, a special concern about us.
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:37.720]   Now, it is God, who in his grace and kindness and infinite condescension, who has chosen
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:40.480]   these terms.
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:44.520]   This is one of these so-called anthropomorphisms, if you like.
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:49.480]   It's God coming down to our level and speaking of himself, as it were, in human terms in
[00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:52.920]   order that we may grasp a certain amount of the truth.
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:58.400]   And what he's saying is this, that as our Father, he, like the human, natural Father,
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:07.560]   takes a very special interest and concern in us, in our well-being, in our welfare,
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:10.680]   in our good.
[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:19.640]   Now the term carries the meaning of necessity, and we have to realize that God thus takes
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.600]   this special interest in us.
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:26.600]   There is a glorious phrase, again used by our Lord, that puts it more perfectly than
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:27.600]   anything else.
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:33.160]   He says that the very hairs of our head are all numbered.
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:38.620]   That's the measure of the loving interest and special concern which God as our Father
[00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:40.440]   takes in us.
[00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:48.360]   And then, of course, at the same time, as a Father, he plans for us.
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:53.560]   It isn't just that he is passive and that he is someone whom we can approach when we
[00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:56.040]   want something and who gives us that something.
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.040]   Then we thank him.
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.040]   He doesn't stop at that.
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:01.360]   That's there, of course, but there's much more than that.
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:04.240]   The Father plans for the child.
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:09.480]   The child isn't capable of doing so until a certain age, but the Father has to do it
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:10.640]   for him.
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:16.640]   The Father, having the interest and the future of this child in his mind, plans for the child.
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:20.160]   The child would like to spend his time playing, but the Father knows that there's no prospect
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:24.560]   in that, so he plans that the child should go to school and have certain instruction
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:25.920]   and do this, that, and the other.
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:30.420]   It is the Father who has to do all that planning for the well-being and the future interest
[00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:33.100]   of the child.
[00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:37.760]   And God does that for us.
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:43.520]   The whole of our salvation is the result of God's plan, and God has got a great and a
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:45.600]   glorious plan for us.
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:48.480]   That's the thing the Apostle is concerned about here.
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:49.480]   What is it?
[00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:52.620]   Well, to bring us to glory.
[00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:56.920]   You see, this is a great theme which you'll find running through the whole of the Scriptures.
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:02.760]   Take for instance that statement of it which you find in the second chapter of the epistle
[00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:10.640]   to the Hebrews, in verse 10, Hebrews 2.10, "For it became him for whom are all things
[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:18.260]   and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their
[00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.260]   salvation perfect through sufferings."
[00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:28.940]   Now then, there is God's plan, to bring his sons, his many sons, to glory, to that
[00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:33.940]   ultimate glory, which the Apostle has already referred to at the beginning of chapter 5,
[00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:37.660]   and which he's going on to deal with later on in this very chapter that we are looking
[00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:38.660]   at at the moment.
[00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:43.620]   Now then, God has got this great plan for us.
[00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:48.220]   So we must cease to think, you see, of our relationship to God in terms of God as just
[00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:53.020]   someone who is passive, as I say, and to whom we become related now and again.
[00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:56.020]   It isn't that at all.
[00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:59.940]   God has planned and has mapped the whole thing out.
[00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:04.460]   He's bringing us to that ultimate glory.
[00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:05.460]   And how does he do that?
[00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:09.580]   Well, he does it by leading us, by directing us.
[00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:14.820]   Now here it is, they that are led by the Spirit, they are the sons of God.
[00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:15.820]   He leads us.
[00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:18.740]   We'll come to that in a moment.
[00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:27.060]   But we've been reminded by our reading from Hebrews 12, verses 6-10 just now, that also
[00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:33.340]   we've got here something further, and that is that God as our Father, in the light of
[00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:41.260]   his ultimate plan and purpose of bringing us to glory, also chastises us, and we must
[00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.100]   never lose sight of this.
[00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:46.340]   Here is his own argument, you see.
[00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:48.900]   He takes the case of the natural Father.
[00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:56.300]   Moreover, we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence.
[00:15:56.300 --> 00:16:00.900]   Shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits and live?
[00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:06.340]   They verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure, but he for our profit
[00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:11.120]   that we might be partakers of his holiness.
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:16.300]   So God takes this personal interest in us, and as his children, we are not allowed to
[00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:18.440]   do anything we like.
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.440]   And nothing happens.
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:23.540]   Oh no, he pulls us up, he chastises us, he punishes us.
[00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:24.540]   We suffer for it.
[00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:25.540]   Why?
[00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:30.500]   Well, not that God may delight in punishing us, but for our profit, for our benefit, for
[00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:33.820]   our sanctification, that we may be holy.
[00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:39.300]   And he goes on, we don't like this, he says, but it's very essential because we've got
[00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:46.500]   to follow peace with all men, and holiness without which no men shall see the Lord.
[00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:54.380]   Very well then, there we see that God, looking at us one by one, each one of us is a child,
[00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:58.660]   and he is interested in every one of us in the same way.
[00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:04.540]   And thus he deals with us, not only leading us, but arresting us, punishing, chastising,
[00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:07.860]   doing things which we don't like at the time.
[00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:14.020]   We grumble and complain as the natural child does, but you must understand, says that man,
[00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:19.380]   that he puts you into that gymnasium, as it were, in order to prepare you for the glory
[00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:25.340]   which is God awaiting you, and which he is going to share with you himself.
[00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:29.340]   So we begin to look at what's happening to us in a different way, and we thank God for
[00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:34.940]   chastisement, whom the Lord loveth, we say, he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom
[00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:36.980]   he calleth.
[00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:42.980]   And thus we see, even in moments and days, perhaps years of chastisement, the loving
[00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:44.860]   hand of God upon us.
[00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:49.460]   It's a difficult lesson to learn, but it's a very glorious one.
[00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:56.540]   And so, you see, we turn our very chastisements and moments of pain into something which gives
[00:17:56.540 --> 00:18:01.860]   us a glorious assurance of our relationship to our Father.
[00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:09.980]   But not only that, of course, he provides for us, cares for us in that way.
[00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:12.980]   He protects us.
[00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:20.500]   There is a restraining grace, there is a grace that goes before us, a prevenient grace.
[00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:22.900]   We are surrounded by the grace of God.
[00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:28.800]   He protects us in various ways that we only come to realize perhaps afterwards.
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:33.540]   Looking back across your life, you see certain incidents, and you can say quite honestly,
[00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:36.260]   they're but for the grace of God.
[00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:41.780]   Now, not only in the matter of your salvation, you can say that even in your Christian life,
[00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:46.140]   you can see how you would have gone, as others have gone, into some error, some apostasy
[00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:51.980]   or something, were it not for the restraining hand of God upon you.
[00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:56.060]   And he can restrain our enemies, and thus he protects us.
[00:18:56.060 --> 00:19:02.780]   I'm saying all this in order that we may just understand something of the richness
[00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:12.340]   of this whole concept of our being the sons of God, underneath of the everlasting arms.
[00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:14.260]   There it is.
[00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:21.180]   He sees it all before we do, and he's always there, surrounding us, the protection which
[00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:24.160]   we receive from God.
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:31.740]   And then look at it from this other aspect, that he is always ready to listen to us, and
[00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:38.980]   to receive us, and to hear what we've got to say, and to grant us his blessings.
[00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:43.440]   He is more ready to give than we are to receive.
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:48.020]   Our Lord says, "Your heavenly Father knoweth the things that you desire of him before you
[00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:49.020]   even ask him."
[00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:55.180]   Now, that's all a manifestation of this great Father heart and love of God towards
[00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:58.420]   his children, those who are his sons.
[00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:05.060]   He anticipates us, he goes before us, but he is ready always to receive us.
[00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:13.060]   Now, you see how practical these points are, how valuable it is to realize that when we
[00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:18.700]   pray to God and when we go into his presence.
[00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:23.780]   You don't pray truly if you're doubtful and uncertain.
[00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:28.340]   We should go into the presence of God as a child goes to his Father.
[00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:33.900]   We do it with reverence and godly fear, of course, realizing that our heavenly Father
[00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:41.300]   is who and what he is, but we should go with this childlike confidence and simplicity.
[00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:44.860]   And if we don't, we're not praying truly.
[00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:48.380]   There are people, you see, who think that they must so safeguard the holiness and the
[00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:52.260]   majesty and the greatness of God that they deny this doctrine of sonship.
[00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:54.420]   It's God's own doctrine.
[00:20:54.420 --> 00:21:00.700]   We are to go as children to the Father with that confidence of our acceptance, with that
[00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:10.940]   assurance, so that a formal, cold prayer is not a sign of great spirituality or of understanding.
[00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:17.580]   Let us be careful that we don't underestimate any aspect of the doctrine.
[00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:23.780]   I know that some of us are in danger of reacting against the glib, false familiarity that is
[00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:25.260]   displayed by some people.
[00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:28.980]   I'm not advocating that.
[00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:34.780]   We never like a child, do we, that is too familiar with the parent or that doesn't
[00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:36.500]   show respect to the parent.
[00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:42.860]   That's all right, but don't react so violently against that, that you deny the doctrine of
[00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:44.860]   sonship.
[00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:49.660]   The doctrine of sonship is here for our help and for our encouragement.
[00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:54.620]   It is to teach us how to come into God's presence, I say, with the confidence of a
[00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:57.820]   child going to his Father.
[00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:02.580]   When you and I as Christian people go to God, we are not going to the Judge Eternal.
[00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:05.140]   We are going to our Father which is in heaven.
[00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:06.620]   Let's not forget that.
[00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:11.500]   Or, again, to use the language of the author of the epistle to the Hebrews, he puts it
[00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:18.260]   like this, "Let us therefore come boldly, with confidence and assurance, unto the throne
[00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:19.260]   of grace."
[00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:26.040]   Yes, emphasize the throne, but emphasize the grace equally.
[00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:30.220]   We have passed from judgment into life.
[00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:32.800]   We are the children of God.
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:35.140]   The apostle wants us to realize that.
[00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:37.220]   That's why he brings it in here.
[00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:42.540]   He said you should have this great assurance and realize, therefore, that God is ready
[00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:44.980]   to listen to you.
[00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:52.340]   That as an earthly parent, who may be very busy on some occasion, he may be a man of
[00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:56.340]   great affairs, a head of a great business, or a great professional man or something,
[00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:58.860]   and his program is absolutely full.
[00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:02.500]   Somebody wants to see him, he sends out a message to say he can't be seen.
[00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:03.500]   An important man, perhaps.
[00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:07.260]   No, he can't see him, his program is full.
[00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:13.220]   And then suddenly he hears a little tapping at his door, and he knows that it's his
[00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:19.520]   little child who's there, and he drops everything and opens the door.
[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:22.700]   God is like that, my friends.
[00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:24.700]   God is our Father.
[00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:26.700]   He's ready to listen to us.
[00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:29.180]   He's ready to bear with us.
[00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:31.540]   He knoweth our frame.
[00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:37.900]   We are, as Paul says, his dear children.
[00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:45.420]   If only we could lay hold on this, it would revolutionize our Christian experiences.
[00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:48.020]   Sons of God.
[00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:54.060]   And that is something of the content of the meaning of the term, as you think of it in
[00:23:54.060 --> 00:24:00.540]   terms of God's attitude and relationship toward us.
[00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:02.660]   Expand it for yourselves.
[00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:07.060]   Expand it in terms of what you'll find taught in the Scripture here and there.
[00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:11.860]   When my father and mother forget me, says the psalmist, even then the Lord will take
[00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:14.380]   me up.
[00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:19.340]   As a father pitieth his children, so the Lord.
[00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:20.860]   That's it.
[00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:27.420]   These are the terms that are used in the Scripture itself, God condescending to our lowest state
[00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:34.280]   in order that we may know the relationship, rejoice in it, and act upon it as we come
[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:35.280]   into his presence.
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:41.500]   Well, that leads me to the next application, which is what this term tells us the other
[00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:46.080]   way around, about our relationship to him.
[00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:51.240]   And it means this for me to put it in a phrase, that we no longer go to God with a craven
[00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:56.000]   fear, reverence and godly fear, but no craven fear.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.280]   That must go.
[00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:01.280]   With boldness, with confidence, these are the terms.
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:03.880]   We have access with confidence.
[00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:09.260]   We come to the Father, says Paul again to the Ephesians, for by one Spirit we both have
[00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:13.320]   access in one body unto the Father.
[00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:16.400]   Ephesians 2.18, it's always that.
[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:19.400]   And he's anxious that we should rejoice in this.
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:27.080]   And of course we shall go on to work it out still more when we come to verses 15 and 16.
[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:33.520]   But I do want to stop for a moment again and put this in the form of a question.
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:35.400]   Are we all clear about this?
[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:38.400]   Have we all grasped this?
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:45.280]   Is this the way in which we approach God when we go to him in prayer?
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:50.520]   God deliver us from stereotyped formal prayers.
[00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:52.080]   Let us, I say, come in this way.
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:55.920]   That is why some of us are a little bit critical of certain liturgies.
[00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:58.080]   You know, they don't bring out this aspect.
[00:25:58.080 --> 00:25:59.080]   It isn't there.
[00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:05.500]   There's a lack of this warmth, this intimacy, this assurance, this confidence.
[00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:09.480]   And to that extent, it isn't true to the New Testament teaching.
[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:16.480]   Let us be guided, I say, by what God in his infinite kindness has chosen to tell us about
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:17.480]   ourselves.
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:23.160]   Well, I leave it at that for the moment, because when we get on, as I say, to verse 15, we
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:25.600]   shall see further aspects of it emerging.
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:28.520]   But let me come to the next question.
[00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:32.440]   You remember I said last week that there were some five main subdivisions in this little
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:36.880]   section from verse 14 to verse 17.
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:39.480]   The first was that not everybody is a son.
[00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:41.280]   Secondly, that we are.
[00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:45.400]   Thirdly, some of the features and characteristics of sonship, which we've just been dealing
[00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:46.400]   with.
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:50.880]   Fourth, how we may be sure of our sonship.
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:51.880]   That's the thing.
[00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:54.600]   That's the practical thing.
[00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:55.600]   We've seen what it tells.
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:59.520]   Well, now, how may I know that I'm a son?
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:02.480]   That's how it comes to us in a practical manner.
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:09.640]   And the Apostle has got a number of answers here to this question.
[00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:13.000]   It's the thing that's uppermost in his mind, of course, here, as he develops it.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.060]   He develops sonship mainly in terms of the assurance of sonship.
[00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:23.060]   And the first thing he tells us is this, that we can be quite sure that we are sons of God
[00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:28.400]   if we are led by the Spirit of God.
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:29.700]   He's got other reasons.
[00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:33.880]   In verse 15 it's going to be that we haven't got the spirit of bondage, but the spirit
[00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:34.880]   of adoption.
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:37.480]   And another one is that the Spirit beareth witness to this.
[00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:41.400]   Now, he's interested in sonship, you see, from the standpoint of assurance the whole
[00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:42.400]   time.
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:49.300]   But let's look at this first proof that we may have of the fact that we are sons of God.
[00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:54.400]   It is, I say, that we are led by the Spirit of God.
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:59.880]   Now, this, of course, is a reference to the Holy Spirit.
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:04.200]   He's already been referring to the Spirit as the Spirit of God in verse 9.
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:09.400]   He are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you.
[00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:10.660]   That's the Holy Spirit.
[00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:13.360]   He also calls him the Spirit of Christ, and so on.
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:16.760]   If the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you.
[00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:18.120]   It's all along the Holy Spirit.
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:23.200]   Verse 13, "If ye through the Spirit," the Holy Spirit, "do mortify the deeds of the
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:24.200]   body."
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:32.280]   So, the reference here to the Spirit of God is not to some vague general spirit that may
[00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:34.960]   be in us.
[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:41.880]   It is specifically to the Holy Spirit himself.
[00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:47.800]   And therefore the proposition is that we can know that we are sons or children of God if
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:53.000]   we are being led by the Holy Spirit.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.400]   Now, this is something that he says is true of all Christians.
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:01.040]   He's not talking about some Christians.
[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:07.200]   He says this is true of all Christians, that they are led by the Spirit of God.
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:12.280]   There's a great analogy, of course, in the Old Testament.
[00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:16.040]   The children of Israel were the children of God.
[00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:18.200]   They were his own peculiar people.
[00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:23.200]   Well, now they, you remember, were brought out of Egypt and taken into Canaan.
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:29.560]   They were led from the captivity of Egypt into the land of Canaan, the land flowing
[00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:32.320]   with milk and honey.
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:33.320]   How were they led?
[00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:40.600]   Well, you remember, it was a pillar of fire by night and a cloud by day.
[00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:42.520]   And there are detailed instructions about this.
[00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:47.240]   Do you remember how we are told that the cloud settled on the tabernacle?
[00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:50.680]   And while the cloud was there on the tabernacle, they didn't move.
[00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:52.160]   They dare not move.
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:56.440]   But when the cloud was raised and moved, they moved.
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:57.800]   They followed the cloud.
[00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:00.360]   It was the pillar of fire at night, but it was the cloud.
[00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:02.240]   It led them through the Red Sea.
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:05.200]   It led them through their journeys in the wilderness.
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:10.860]   And their whole life was governed by the movement of this cloud.
[00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:18.040]   It was God leading his people from captivity into the promised land of Canaan.
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:23.120]   And what he is saying here is just this, that we are in a like condition.
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:27.480]   It's spiritual now, not so material as it was then.
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:33.900]   But we as the children of God are being led by the Holy Spirit from the Egypt, the bondage,
[00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:40.880]   the sin of this evil world, into our heavenly Canaan, the heavenly Jerusalem.
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:43.560]   Now that is life to the Christians.
[00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:46.120]   The Christian is a man who is on a pilgrimage.
[00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:47.120]   He is being led.
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:50.240]   Do you remember there were enemies around the children of Israel?
[00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:55.920]   There were problems that arose, no food, no water, and many another problem.
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:31:02.300]   But the whole time they were being led, God was, as it were, leading them by the cloud.
[00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:04.720]   The apostle says that our Lord was there also.
[00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:07.840]   He was the rock that followed them.
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:11.400]   These are just figures to show us the leading of God.
[00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:16.360]   And here he puts it in this way, that we are being led.
[00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:20.960]   Is there anything more marvelous than to think of our lives as Christian people just like
[00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:21.960]   this?
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:23.360]   We are in a wilderness, my friends.
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:24.760]   This world is a wilderness.
[00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:29.900]   Isn't it becoming more and more obvious that it is?
[00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:32.580]   Don't you see it in the things that are happening in it?
[00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:37.580]   The pitfalls, the privations, the quarreling, the fighting, the ugliness?
[00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:41.580]   It is a howling, barren wilderness.
[00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:46.700]   And you and I are being led through it all, to the Canaan of our desire.
[00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:50.340]   And we are being led by the Holy Spirit of God.
[00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:51.340]   How?
[00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:52.340]   What does it mean?
[00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:55.680]   Well, let's look at the term for a moment.
[00:31:55.680 --> 00:32:00.980]   The term, as he puts it, is in the passive voice.
[00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:07.980]   As many as are led—a better translation would be this; it is continuous also—as
[00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:13.060]   many as are being led.
[00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:16.180]   And when you are being led, you are passive.
[00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:21.620]   Now, of course, you mustn't put that and press that to a ridiculous extreme.
[00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:24.780]   He doesn't say you're being carried.
[00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:27.380]   He doesn't say that you're put into an armchair and carried.
[00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:29.180]   No, you're being led.
[00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:35.280]   But though you are being led and you are actually using your own feet and your own limbs, somebody
[00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:36.460]   else is directing you.
[00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:37.460]   That's the notion.
[00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:40.160]   The passive element comes in in that way.
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:44.020]   There's no lying on a bed of roses in Christianity.
[00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:47.180]   Any teaching which says it's quite easy, you've got nothing to do, hand it all over,
[00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:48.180]   is always wrong.
[00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:49.180]   No, no.
[00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:52.620]   You're not a child carried in arms, you know, you're being led.
[00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:55.980]   You're a man and you're being led.
[00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:58.380]   You need the guidance and the direction.
[00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:02.380]   So it is this passive and the present continuous.
[00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:08.740]   As many as are being led by the Spirit of God, well, they can be quite certain that
[00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:13.100]   they are the sons of God.
[00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:16.780]   Let me draw another point of distinction.
[00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:22.580]   When he says as many as are led, he doesn't mean that we are forced.
[00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:25.720]   He doesn't mean that we are driven.
[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:28.660]   Now that's an important distinction.
[00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:34.220]   Paul here uses exactly the same word as we have used in the first verse of the fourth
[00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:36.020]   chapter of Luke's Gospel.
[00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:39.100]   Listen to Luke 4.1.
[00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:46.220]   And Jesus, being full of the Holy Ghost, returned from Jerusalem and was led by the Spirit into
[00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:47.220]   the wilderness.
[00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:51.980]   I once heard a man saying that that should read, "and was driven by the Spirit."
[00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:53.500]   It's quite wrong.
[00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:58.980]   The Holy Spirit had no need to drive our Lord, and he never did.
[00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:03.380]   And the Spirit doesn't drive the children of God.
[00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:07.260]   What he does is to persuade them.
[00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:12.700]   He leads us by persuasion, not by brute force.
[00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:17.660]   Not against our will, he persuades the will, which is a very different thing.
[00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:21.940]   There is no violence in Christianity at all.
[00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:24.920]   We are not saved violently.
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:27.740]   It is persuasion even there, in the moment of salvation.
[00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:31.860]   A man is never saved against his will.
[00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:34.700]   To say that is to be ridiculous.
[00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:40.980]   What the Spirit does is to enlighten and persuade, so that we desire the thing.
[00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:42.820]   That is his operation.
[00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:47.940]   Puts this new principle into us, this new disposition, and then we desire it.
[00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:54.300]   It must never be thought of as being contrary, so that the element of forcing or being driven
[00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:55.300]   is involved.
[00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:57.020]   That's quite false.
[00:34:57.020 --> 00:34:59.580]   It is a persuasion.
[00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:02.500]   It is, I say, never against the grain.
[00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:03.820]   Look at the way it's put.
[00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:09.180]   Take 1 John 5.3, for instance.
[00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:15.180]   He says that the man who loves is the man who keeps the commandments.
[00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:18.820]   This is the love of God, that we keep his commandments.
[00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:24.580]   And then he adds, "And his commandments are not grievous."
[00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:26.300]   You see, they're not grievous to the Christian.
[00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:28.340]   They're very grievous to the non-Christian.
[00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:34.120]   The non-Christian says, "I don't want your Christianity, too narrow, with your commandments
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:36.340]   and your prohibitions, too narrow."
[00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:37.340]   They're grievous.
[00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:38.340]   They're annoying.
[00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:39.340]   They're annoying.
[00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:40.340]   He detests.
[00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:43.140]   But the Christian says, "His commandments are not grievous.
[00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:44.980]   He's been persuaded.
[00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:47.100]   He's got an understanding now."
[00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:51.520]   And then you remember how our Lord puts it again in the Sermon on the Mount, where he
[00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:59.220]   says, "Blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall
[00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:00.220]   be filled."
[00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:01.220]   Now, that's the position.
[00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:03.020]   The Christian does that.
[00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:09.980]   But let me put it to you by a contrast, by reading to you from Psalm 32, verses eight
[00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:10.980]   and nine.
[00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:15.060]   Here is the whole thing, in a sense.
[00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:22.420]   God says, Psalm 32, eight and nine, "I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which
[00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:24.460]   thou shalt go.
[00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:32.460]   I will guide thee with mine eye," then the negative, "be ye not as the horse or as the
[00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:38.860]   mule which have no understanding, whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest
[00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:40.580]   they come near unto thee."
[00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:42.140]   Now you notice the contrast.
[00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:48.420]   We are not to be like the horse, still less like the mule, where you need a bit and a
[00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:49.980]   bridle and force.
[00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:50.980]   No, no.
[00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:53.300]   We are not to be like that.
[00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:58.220]   We are to be guided by God's eye, "I will guide thee with mine eye," and all we do is
[00:36:58.220 --> 00:37:01.620]   to keep our eye on him, you see, and then we follow.
[00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:02.620]   That's how he leads.
[00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:03.900]   That's how he guides.
[00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:10.700]   It isn't the case of breaking in an obstinate mule or breaking in a wild cult.
[00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:11.780]   That isn't the notion at all.
[00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:14.620]   You don't need a bearing rein on the Christian.
[00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:16.260]   That isn't God's method.
[00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:17.260]   It is this persuasion.
[00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:26.780]   I say not force it, or take it as you get it in Isaiah chapter 30 verse 21, "Thine ears
[00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:34.580]   shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way; walk ye in it, when ye turn to
[00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:39.320]   the right hand, and when ye turn to the left."
[00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:40.320]   That's it.
[00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:46.900]   It's this blessed voice that's there, speaking and whispering behind us, this word, and we
[00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:48.220]   hear it and we respond.
[00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:49.420]   That's how he guides.
[00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:52.380]   It's by words, by persuasion.
[00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:56.740]   So that I'll sum it up like this.
[00:37:56.740 --> 00:38:04.360]   In general, to be led by the Spirit means that our life is guided and determined and
[00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:08.460]   directed by the Holy Spirit.
[00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:11.940]   Now that's what makes a man a Christian.
[00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:14.660]   That is never true of the natural man.
[00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:20.900]   The natural man at his very best, he is not guided by the Spirit, not led by the Spirit.
[00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:21.900]   What leads him?
[00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:29.980]   Well, he, at the lowest level of course, is guided by nothing but his own desires.
[00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:31.860]   He feels like doing a thing and he does it.
[00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:36.220]   He's got a thirst, he's got a hunger, another impulse, and he responds.
[00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:37.620]   He's like an animal.
[00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:44.820]   He's guided by his impulses, instincts, lusts, passions, desires, all this that is
[00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:50.380]   in his physical frame and in his perverted mind.
[00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:52.740]   There is the natural man at his lowest.
[00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:56.660]   But coming up the scale a little, he may be guided only by the mind of the world.
[00:38:56.660 --> 00:39:01.020]   You see, the vast majority of people are guided by the mind of the world today.
[00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:03.340]   They don't think for themselves.
[00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:04.340]   What are they doing tonight?
[00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:07.780]   They are doing what everybody else is doing.
[00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:11.060]   The goods they buy are what are advertised.
[00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:13.900]   Their only reason for buying them is that they are told everybody is buying them.
[00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:18.900]   Now, you see, they are led and guided by the world and the mind of the world, isn't it?
[00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:21.100]   Well, and it happens all around.
[00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:23.460]   That's their philosophy of life.
[00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:27.060]   They take their views from their newspaper, even on politics and things like that.
[00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:28.180]   You hear them repeating them.
[00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:29.180]   They don't think for themselves.
[00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:35.140]   They are led and guided by these powers that are controlling these media, newspapers, wireless
[00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:37.820]   television, and so on and so forth.
[00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:41.620]   Well, come higher up still.
[00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:43.220]   Some of them are led by their reason.
[00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:48.120]   Well, it's a good thing, if you like, that a man should be led by his reason.
[00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:51.500]   But a natural human reason is never enough.
[00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:53.460]   It doesn't understand enough.
[00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:56.320]   It doesn't see the subtleties of the situation.
[00:39:56.320 --> 00:40:02.500]   But the natural man, at his best, is a man who is guided by reason and common sense.
[00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:03.980]   Never anything higher than that.
[00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:07.460]   He isn't led by the spirit.
[00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:11.260]   And he uses his own willpower and his own determination.
[00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:19.020]   Now then, the Christian is somebody who is in an entirely different position and in a
[00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:21.420]   different category.
[00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:25.620]   He is not led by any of those things.
[00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:29.620]   He is led ultimately by the Spirit of God.
[00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:36.860]   The Spirit of God may do so through his reason and in other ways, as I'm hoping to show you.
[00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:47.580]   But the thing that is central about him is that he and his life is governed by the leading
[00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:52.420]   the direction of the Holy Spirit of God.
[00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:56.540]   Now that does not mean for a moment that this man is perfect.
[00:40:56.540 --> 00:41:05.460]   He's not perfect, but this is what you can say about him, that the main and obvious tendency
[00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:12.860]   and direction of his life is that which is dictated by the Holy Spirit.
[00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:14.880]   Now I'm going to leave it at that tonight.
[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:19.820]   I'm not going to come to the details as to how the Spirit does do this in actual practice.
[00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:24.340]   It may be a good thing that we should all meditate about this for ourselves during the
[00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:25.340]   coming week.
[00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:29.060]   So I'm going to leave you with a question.
[00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:38.900]   Can you say that your life, taking it now as a whole, your thought life, your feelings,
[00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:49.380]   your action, your will, your everything, can you say that your life in the main is under
[00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:53.660]   the direction of the Spirit of God?
[00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:56.300]   I'm not asking you whether you're perfect.
[00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:59.420]   I know you're not any more than I am.
[00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:07.580]   But can you say this, with all my faults and failures and all that is true of me, I say
[00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:19.860]   that the directing force and principle in my life is the Spirit of God.
[00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:27.300]   Now says Paul, if you can say that, you are a son of God.
[00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:29.380]   Very well, as I say, I leave it at that.
[00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:30.700]   I've got more to say.
[00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:33.260]   I can help you much more.
[00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:36.180]   But perhaps it's a good thing that you should help yourselves first.
[00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:39.220]   It'll make you still more sure.
[00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:40.220]   That's the problem for you.
[00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:41.220]   Can you say this?
[00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:44.020]   Are you sure of this?
[00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:52.220]   Is the main direction of your life being determined by the Holy Spirit of God?
[00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:59.140]   If it is, whatever may be true about you, whatever your faults or failures, I say to
[00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:08.340]   you on the authority of God himself, you are a son of God.
[00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:09.340]   Let us pray.
[00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:20.020]   O Lord, our God, we come to Thee again, and we come humbly, simply to thank Thee for these
[00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:24.020]   extraordinary things about which we have been speaking together.
[00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:33.460]   O open our eyes, we pray Thee, to see these things with clarity and reality, until we
[00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:38.460]   shall be filled with a sense of praise and of thanksgiving.
[00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:50.820]   O God, by Thy Spirit, enlighten the eyes of our understanding, that we may know that we
[00:43:50.820 --> 00:44:00.740]   are Thy children, Thy dear children, and that Thou art our Father.
[00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:07.740]   And now may the grace of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ and the love of God, the fellowship
[00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:14.700]   and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night, throughout
[00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:22.820]   the remainder of this hour's short and certain earthly life and pilgrimage, and evermore.
[00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:24.940]   Amen.
[00:44:24.940 --> 00:44:28.860]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
