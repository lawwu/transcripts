[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.840]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.640]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.280]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.680]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio to your children's
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.200]   education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.120]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.400]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.960]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's totally
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.840]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.960]   You heard about it here.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.640]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:43.760]   Hello and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.000]   life, money and travel all while spending less and saving more.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.280]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins.
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.120]   And before we jump in, I just want to thank all of you for your support because
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.760]   this show has already grown beyond my expectations.
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.480]   In fact, it's gotten so big that I've decided to start looking for someone to
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.440]   help out part-time.
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.360]   That includes everything from reaching out to guests, helping edit episodes,
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.640]   creating social media posts and so much more.
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.960]   I thought I'd share this with you first in case there's a listener out there
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.440]   looking for their own side hustle.
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.720]   So if you're interested, please shoot me an email at chris@allthehacks.com.
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.360]   Okay, so this week we're talking to Andy Hill, the founder of the award-winning
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.800]   podcast and blog Marriage, Kids and Money.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.920]   He and his wife, Nicole, have two kids and have been on an incredible journey
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:29.440]   together.
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.760]   They started out with $50,000 in debt when they found out they were having a
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.360]   child and aggressively saved to be debt-free before she was born.
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.880]   But they didn't stop there.
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.920]   Over the next 10 years, they managed to pay off their mortgage and build their
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.760]   net worth to over a million dollars.
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.880]   In this episode, we'll talk about how they managed to do all of that.
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.440]   We'll get Andy's relationship hacks, especially about how to manage money with
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.040]   your spouse and learn what he's doing to teach his kids all about money.
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.920]   I'm really looking forward to this one.
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.920]   But before we jump in, I have to remind you, Chris Hutchins works at Wealthfront.
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.040]   All opinions expressed by Chris and his guests are solely their own opinions and
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.880]   do not reflect the opinion of Wealthfront.
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.080]   This podcast is for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon for
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.040]   investment decisions.
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.800]   Andy, thanks for being here.
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:15.880]   Thanks for having me, Chris.
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:16.440]   Appreciate it.
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.360]   Yeah, it's always fun to get to talk to someone on a podcast that you've known
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.880]   for a bit.
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.840]   We've met at FinCon a few times, so this is really exciting and I want to jump
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:25.320]   right in.
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.160]   Absolutely.
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.480]   I'm in.
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.520]   So you've built an entire brand around marriage, kids and money, and we haven't
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.920]   really delved in this show into the marriage or the kids.
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.360]   We've talked a lot about money, so I want to start off on the relationship side and
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.000]   just understand what do you think some of the common misconceptions are when it
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.640]   comes to relationships and money?
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.120]   Oh man, I think personally, and then I think of some of the folks that I've been
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.360]   able to speak to on the show, but one thing that pops up into my brain, just
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.880]   because you're one couple doesn't mean you think with one brain, right?
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:07.440]   So we've said yes, we've said I do, but that doesn't mean that our ideas and our
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.520]   concepts around money are the same.
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.080]   And I know that's definitely not the case with my wife and I.
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.640]   And as we got married, we didn't have a lot of those conversations beforehand.
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:22.400]   We didn't have a lot of those discussions on our finances, where we wanted to go,
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.360]   our dreams, our goals, things like that beforehand.
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.200]   But those definitely came up well after the fact, after we were married.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.120]   And we realized that we definitely had quite a bit of differences with regard
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.200]   to our finances and our goals and things like that.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.160]   And only through conversation were we able to improve that.
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.280]   And I've definitely seen that through a lot of the couples that I've
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.560]   been interviewed on the show too.
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:51.440]   It's just because you are one couple doesn't mean you share one brain, for sure.
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:57.080]   And outside of that, I would say another maybe common misconception is that
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.000]   marriage is like an action and that it happens on that day.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.800]   You're done, right?
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:02.720]   You know, we've got married.
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.400]   We crossed the aisle and said, I do.
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.400]   But it's really a verb.
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.760]   It's action-based.
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:14.840]   It's one of those things that requires consistent work and it evolves over time.
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.760]   And you need to be ready for that change.
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.760]   And if you're stagnant and you say, hey, this is how we've always done it.
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.320]   This is who I am.
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.280]   That's when I've seen relationships fall apart.
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.800]   And I even see that with my relationship with my wife, where it's one of those
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:34.000]   things, if I am just saying, hey, this is how we've always done it, you know, deal
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.080]   with it, that's when things don't go well.
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.880]   So those are some of the common misconceptions that I've seen.
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.360]   Yeah, I think to your first one, it's interesting how I don't think anyone
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.880]   believes that their spouse and them have to have the same favorite food.
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.440]   They have to have the same like favorite vacation style.
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.280]   And you make that work.
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.560]   You go on, my wife and I went on a trip and, you know, maybe one day I want to go
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.040]   see something crazy that she doesn't.
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.520]   So she comes along one day, she wants to do something.
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.560]   I do that.
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.000]   And that's totally fine.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.320]   Is that harder with money?
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:07.920]   Is there, are there ways to have a kind of approach to money that meets two
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.560]   different attitudes or two different styles, or do you really need to try to
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.520]   merge them and find one way to manage your money together?
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.400]   I think a lot of it just comes from a few things.
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.800]   Understanding where your spouse comes from with money.
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.560]   We are who we are today based on our history.
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.400]   And that sometimes comes from our upbringing.
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.640]   That comes from how our parents raised us.
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.800]   So, well, my parents raised me in a different way than my wife did.
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.560]   Other couples, the same thing.
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:40.120]   But some of those realizations don't come up until later on when there's some real
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.760]   strife or some maybe money fights that are happening that pop up.
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:47.560]   Well, I've always thought this way and you think this way, that's wrong.
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.240]   You know, I know that this is right.
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.200]   This is wrong.
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.520]   It's not wrong.
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.080]   It's just different.
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:58.400]   And for me, for a while in our relationship, I had that hardheaded mentality of, hey,
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.000]   I've been reading about money.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.640]   I know money stuff.
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:02.600]   This is correct.
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.960]   And what you're thinking of is wrong, but really it's not wrong.
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.480]   It's just a different way of thinking.
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:14.120]   And so, until I took my stubborn hat off and put my empathy shoes on, I didn't really
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.600]   take the time to understand her position.
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:21.640]   But when I did that, then I could really take her position and understand where she's coming
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:22.640]   from.
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:24.880]   And I know that helps out a lot of couples when you're able to do that, when you're
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:29.960]   able to think in terms of their feelings and their situation and maybe where they're coming
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:30.960]   from.
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:35.600]   So, a good example of this is at the beginning of our relationship, Nicole and I, I got really
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.520]   geeked about paying off our debt.
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.520]   I got really excited about becoming debt-free.
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:40.880]   I thought that idea was really cool.
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:45.560]   We had $50,000 of debt, $30,000 of student loans, and $20,000 car loan.
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:50.880]   And I'm like, I think it would be really great to be debt-free by the time our daughter comes
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:51.880]   into the world.
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.880]   We learned that we were going to be parents, talking about becoming parents, and I said,
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:59.240]   that's a way that I can be a good father and protect this family that's going to be moving
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:00.240]   forward.
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:05.840]   And I said, why don't we, you know, get rid of your luxury car and maybe spend a lot less
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:09.440]   money and then we'll pay off $50,000 in debt in one year.
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:11.200]   What do you think of that idea?
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:14.200]   And she immediately said, are you crazy?
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:15.200]   That sounds horrible.
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:16.200]   That sounds like deprivation.
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.000]   And it sounds like you want me to get rid of my car.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   What was that?
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   And then she just sort of like walked out of the room.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.160]   And I'm like, wait, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.240]   This is a fantastic plan.
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.240]   Where are you going?
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.240]   Why?
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.240]   Why?
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.200]   And what I realized is that I wasn't speaking her language at all, really.
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:34.320]   I was speaking in numbers and facts and figures and she didn't really talk that language.
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:39.080]   And so after I, you know, picked myself back up and had some more conversations with her,
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:42.360]   I started to understand more of her motivation.
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:43.360]   What is her motivation?
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:48.360]   Well, she's excited about being a mother too, and she really doesn't dig the job that she's
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.360]   in.
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.360]   Okay.
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.520]   This is an opportunity for us to look at ways that we can both win.
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:57.120]   I would love this debt-free life and you'd eventually like to go from maybe full-time
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:01.600]   working at a job you don't really like to maybe part-time or eventually full-time stay-at-home
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.640]   mom.
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.440]   And that's where we started to connect a little bit.
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:08.200]   I talked more of the number side of things originally, and then I started talking more
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:13.280]   of the emotional benefits of what you can do when you work together in your finances.
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:19.080]   So I think just sort of realigning your language can help quite a bit when it comes to marriage
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.080]   and money.
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:24.320]   And I've definitely learned that and failed at it quite a few times in our 11-year marriage.
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:25.320]   Yeah.
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.640]   But you're still married 11 years later.
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:27.640]   We still are.
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:28.640]   Yes.
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:29.640]   Got that going for me.
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:30.640]   So it worked.
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:34.080]   Are there questions that you would tell people to start asking, whether they're early in
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:38.240]   a relationship or haven't really gone deep that you think can kind of bring out some
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:43.000]   of these, you know, potential issues in the future that would let them get on the same
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   page?
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.920]   You know, I've talked about that with couples who are dating or maybe in that sort of engagement
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:52.400]   phase where it's like, "Hey, you don't want to ruin the romance by, you know, talking
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:56.800]   numbers and figures all the time, but to my failure point, why don't we talk more about
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:00.480]   goals and aspirations and desires for the future?"
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.280]   And with that then comes the money.
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:04.920]   So for example, a big one, do we want to have kids?
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.540]   Is this something you're interested in?
[00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:11.080]   Because obviously there's a financial ramification to that, but there's also just sort of a life
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:12.720]   partner goal with that.
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.840]   That's a big one.
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:20.860]   And if we have trouble having kids, would you be open to something like IVF or adoption?
[00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:25.800]   These are important topics because if that comes up later on in your relationship and
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:31.120]   you didn't have some sort of pre-conversation about it, that can be a really tough point.
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:34.600]   How about little things like, "Hey, what do you make as a salary?
[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.120]   What kind of debt do you have?"
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:40.000]   Like sort of opening up, you know, taking the blinds down and saying, "Hey, here's who
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   I am.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   Here's what you're marrying.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.600]   Here's what you're going into this relationship because what's mine is going to be yours,
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:47.600]   even the debt stuff."
[00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:52.900]   So having some of those conversations beforehand can kind of help you to understand what you're
[00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:55.580]   getting into so there's not a lot of surprise.
[00:10:55.580 --> 00:11:00.780]   I wish that I was a little bit more open and honest with my wife as I came into, you know,
[00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:02.940]   our relationship and talking about some of these bigger things.
[00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:06.820]   We did have some important conversations through some premarital counseling, but it was less
[00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:13.060]   on the financial side and more just sort of on the, you know, religious and life partner
[00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:14.060]   kind of side.
[00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:17.860]   I wish we would have opened up a little bit more with regard to our finances, but those
[00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:21.980]   are some of the questions that help a lot of couples out there and that I've heard about
[00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:24.900]   when I've talked about on the show as well.
[00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:28.900]   It's amazing how everyone seems to know that we don't talk a lot about money in our society,
[00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:31.020]   but even in relationships, right?
[00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:33.340]   It takes so long before it comes up.
[00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:36.940]   If someone's listening to this and they've already kind of handled like chapter one,
[00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:39.660]   those questions you just mentioned, they're married, you know, they know how much their
[00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:41.860]   spouse makes and they know how much they've saved.
[00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:46.020]   Are there other big questions that you think come up down the road that are opportunities
[00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:47.020]   to address earlier?
[00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:51.900]   Yeah, you know, I would say a lot of it, a lot of the things that I think would be helpful
[00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:56.060]   for couples too is regarding your career or your aspirations, things like that.
[00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:57.580]   Are you in a career?
[00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:02.980]   Are you on a path towards being a business owner that you enjoy or where do you see yourself
[00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:04.340]   going later on?
[00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:11.260]   Because maybe those expectations of what you as the partner are going to get into because
[00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.580]   you're married to this person, you need to know what you're going to get into.
[00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:17.960]   So having those relationship conversations and getting an understanding of those goals
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:21.260]   and aspirations beforehand really help you to know where you're going to be going as
[00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:24.300]   a couple because those can be difficult.
[00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:28.140]   You know, if you're saying, "Hey, I'm already working at a job that I really dislike and
[00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:31.100]   I'm interested in becoming a full-time photographer."
[00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:35.620]   Okay, that's an important thing to talk about because as you move forward, those are going
[00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:37.500]   to be some big transition points.
[00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:41.540]   Maybe there'll be a point where you're fully funding the relationship and taking care of
[00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:47.020]   the healthcare and the income while that person's making a transition into entrepreneurship.
[00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:51.860]   That's going to be a point that's going to require a lot of partnership and communication.
[00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:56.900]   So having some understanding around those career aspirations, those goals, and getting
[00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:59.860]   an understanding about that beforehand can definitely help.
[00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:04.380]   Yeah, I hate to treat a relationship like business, but one of the things that I found
[00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:10.380]   was very interesting as a conversation was, you know, if this thing goes well financially,
[00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:14.340]   meaning if we end up making a lot more money than we think we will, what do we want to
[00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:15.340]   do with that?
[00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:16.980]   How would that change our lives?
[00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:22.080]   And the other side of it, if we end up not doing well financially, if we have problems,
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.660]   are we willing to cut housing?
[00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:25.560]   Are we willing to work more hours?
[00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:27.100]   What kind of life do we want to live?
[00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:32.700]   And I think the closer you can get to being aligned on not necessarily wanting to do the
[00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:36.580]   same things, but understanding each person and their motivations, I think it can really,
[00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:37.580]   really help.
[00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:38.580]   Yeah.
[00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:43.460]   And I think making space and time for those conversations is important because as you
[00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:47.620]   get married, as you know, Chris, when you get married and then you have kids and you've
[00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:53.060]   got the job, you've got everything, your time together, your time to communicate becomes
[00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:54.060]   smaller.
[00:13:54.060 --> 00:14:00.780]   So putting marriage first and making that a priority to always set aside time to connect.
[00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:04.460]   This is our time to talk about the important things because when that goes away, that's
[00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:08.380]   when the big fights start happening because people don't feel like they are being heard.
[00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:14.140]   They don't feel like their buckets are being filled and they take it out on the other spouse.
[00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:19.300]   And that's definitely happened in our relationship for sure.
[00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:21.940]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:22.940]   I get it.
[00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:27.820]   Life comes at you fast, but trust me, your friends are probably desperate for a good
[00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:28.820]   hang.
[00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:32.620]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:37.420]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor Drizzly, the go-to app for
[00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:40.180]   drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:42.980]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:44.820]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:48.980]   It could be your dog's birthday, that the sun finally came out, or maybe you just want
[00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:51.820]   to celebrate that you got through another week.
[00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:56.380]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:14:56.380 --> 00:15:01.280]   which means you can entice your friends to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:05.340]   And since I know you like a good deal, Drizzly compares prices on their massive selection
[00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:08.500]   of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:12.420]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting family last week, not
[00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:17.780]   only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less than an hour, but I found it for $15
[00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:19.540]   less than my local liquor store.
[00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:24.580]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:28.600]   That's D-R-I-Z-Z-L-Y dot com today.
[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:32.660]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:38.540]   I got a lot of satisfaction out of trying to categorize all of our spending to understand
[00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:39.700]   how much we're spending.
[00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:44.460]   And for me, it was about figuring out what we're saving and understanding the impact
[00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:45.880]   that'll have on our future.
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:50.900]   For my wife, it was a monotonous task of going through Mint and recategorizing their terrible
[00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:55.300]   descriptions, you know, saying, "No, this thing at a gas station was actually a vacation,"
[00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:56.940]   and that didn't go well.
[00:15:56.940 --> 00:16:01.300]   But as we talked about why we were doing it, what the purpose was, that helped.
[00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:06.520]   Now we have a child and time is less abundant.
[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:11.820]   Are there times of the week, month, year that you think are good to have these conversations?
[00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:13.620]   Are there ways to make them more fun?
[00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:17.020]   I feel like it almost never is the right time to talk about money.
[00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:18.020]   Yeah, I hear you.
[00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:21.380]   Yeah, in the beginning of our relationship, we set up something, and when I say "we,"
[00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:22.380]   it was me, just like you.
[00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:27.380]   I was grabbing the Mint and being the money nerd saying, "Hey, let's have a budget party.
[00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:29.460]   Let's sit down and review the budget."
[00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:32.700]   I threw the word "party" on it so it sounded like a little bit more fun, and maybe she'd
[00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:33.700]   show up.
[00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:37.140]   I brought some wine and pizza, and that kind of helped a little bit, just put a little
[00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:38.820]   marketing spin on it.
[00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:40.840]   And it worked because she showed up.
[00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:43.940]   But as time rolled on, our lives changed.
[00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:47.740]   We had to get a little bit more inventive with this thing in order to keep that connection.
[00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:51.980]   So when we had little kids, it was like, "Okay, well, we need to connect.
[00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:53.100]   It's important to do that.
[00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:57.180]   Let's do that after they go to bed so we have some time to speak."
[00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:00.660]   And then as the kids got a little older, we said, "Okay, well, they're clawing at our
[00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:01.660]   legs.
[00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:02.940]   Why don't we take this to a play place?"
[00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:07.500]   So we would go to a place where the kids could run around, go down the slides, and jump down
[00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:11.740]   while we were planning our lives and having time together or drinking a coffee.
[00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:17.700]   And we even took our budget party to a restaurant one time where we said, "Hey, let's have dinner.
[00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:21.220]   While we go over the numbers and have the receipts on the table," everybody looked at
[00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:24.740]   us kind of funny, but we were planning our lives and we were figuring things out together
[00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:25.820]   and we didn't care.
[00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:31.540]   So it's just kind of being inventive and making it a good time because, yeah, when you talk
[00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:35.100]   about it like that, just saying, "Hey, let's stare at a spreadsheet and talk about numbers,"
[00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:39.460]   my wife just glazes over and is like, "Dude, can we do anything else?"
[00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:45.540]   But if you add some fun into it and also maybe don't just always talk about the numbers,
[00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:47.900]   we're talking about, "Hey, what's going on this month?
[00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.580]   What activities do we have going on with the kids?
[00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:51.900]   Is there a wedding coming up?
[00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:53.740]   Is there birthday parties that are coming up?
[00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:58.380]   What do we have going on this month that's going to be taking over or that we need to
[00:17:58.380 --> 00:17:59.640]   schedule out?"
[00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:04.060]   And then, at the back end of it, how are we pursuing those goals, those things that we've
[00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:08.860]   always talked about being excited about, whether it's a vacation or hitting some financial
[00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:13.500]   goals like paying off debt or anything like that, how are we doing on those goals that
[00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:17.100]   help us to give us more freedom and more fun today?
[00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:22.900]   So, having a little fun with it and getting inventive has helped us a lot.
[00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:28.060]   I think having that list of shared and independent goals is really, really valuable.
[00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:32.100]   I know there are things I wanted to do like start this podcast that was going to take
[00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:35.860]   up extra time and, for a while, take up extra cost.
[00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:37.820]   And then there are things we wanted to do like vacations.
[00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:42.620]   And so, I think starting off conversations, getting aligned on where you want to go, why
[00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:45.460]   you want to go there, and understanding it is really valuable.
[00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:46.460]   Absolutely.
[00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:51.100]   I think one of the things that I find as a frustration, or I guess maybe more well put,
[00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:55.260]   my wife finds as a frustration, is I treat things very logically, right?
[00:18:55.260 --> 00:19:00.640]   I'm like, "Well, of course, it makes sense to do this thing because the rate of return
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.580]   on this thing is better.
[00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:04.460]   And so, we should, of course, do this."
[00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:09.580]   And so, that taken to its extreme can be a frustrating conversation.
[00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:14.180]   One thing that I know you've talked a lot about is how you guys got a mortgage and paid
[00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:16.700]   it off in about five years.
[00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:20.780]   And I know a lot of people give the financial advice, and I've probably given it to people
[00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:24.380]   as well, which is, "Well, the market return over the long run is better than mortgage
[00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:25.380]   rates."
[00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:28.460]   So, I don't know how I could possibly make that decision.
[00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:32.700]   For you, it wasn't about just always being financially logical and doing the economic
[00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:34.100]   best choice.
[00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:36.900]   How did you guys talk about making that decision?
[00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:38.940]   And then, ultimately, also, how did you do it?
[00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:39.940]   Yeah.
[00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:40.940]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:42.300]   So, in the beginning, it was one of those things.
[00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:49.340]   I had bought a house the first time around in 2004, and I feel like I did it the wrong
[00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:50.340]   way.
[00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:56.060]   I put too little down and got into a situation where I didn't really understand that there
[00:19:56.060 --> 00:20:02.500]   were costs outside of the mortgage, like bills and fixing the place and closing costs, all
[00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:04.940]   sorts of stuff that I didn't even plan on.
[00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:10.060]   Over time, I ended up taking a pay cut at my job in order to move to a different position
[00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:13.220]   because the first position was a little too stressful for me.
[00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:17.660]   I looked at maybe this house and the costs that are associated with it, taking up about
[00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:18.660]   50% of my income.
[00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:22.500]   I just felt like owned by the house instead of owning the house.
[00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:23.940]   And so, I hated that.
[00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:24.940]   I hated that position.
[00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:28.660]   I ended up getting roommates to help me pay the mortgage eventually, which was an old
[00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:31.660]   version of house hacking, I guess, to help me out there.
[00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:37.620]   But even with that, the Great Recession came to Metro Detroit and hit us really hard.
[00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:41.780]   So there was a point in time, I think it was around 2008, 2009, that my $200,000 house
[00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:44.860]   that I bought was now valued at $100,000.
[00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:51.020]   So not only was the cost of it just consuming me, but the asset that I purchased was just
[00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:52.020]   a dud.
[00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:56.580]   And I just felt like, "Man, is this really how it's supposed to go?"
[00:20:56.580 --> 00:21:01.520]   Eventually sold the house about 10 years later for pretty much break even.
[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:06.140]   So when my wife was like, "Hey, let's get a bigger house and a nicer neighborhood, better
[00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:11.000]   schools," I'm like, "I am down, but I do not want to have a mortgage.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.780]   I do not want to have something that I feel like is on my back, that I'm going to have
[00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:16.780]   to keep paying for it.
[00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:20.560]   I'm going to have to keep working at this job that I don't really like that much in
[00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:23.540]   order to pay a mortgage that I'm not really that excited about."
[00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:28.300]   So I said, "Hey, we'll get the house, but let's keep aggressively saving and we'll pay
[00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:29.660]   it off in five years."
[00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:31.020]   And she said, "Cool, that's fine.
[00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:32.020]   Let's do that."
[00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:37.240]   So what we did is essentially just lived on half and kept on making massive principal
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:39.300]   payments each month.
[00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:45.520]   Anytime we got new money that came in, whether it was a tax refund or a bonus or selling
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:51.720]   stuff on Facebook Marketplace or Craigslist, we would throw it at the principal.
[00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:56.260]   And a little bit less than four years later, we were mortgage free.
[00:21:56.260 --> 00:22:01.100]   And with that freedom, we were able to make some changes in our lives.
[00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:05.660]   We were able to travel a bit more, we were able to make some career choice changes that
[00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:07.180]   I eventually made.
[00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:12.660]   And that initial conversation with Nicole, to your point, it wasn't easy, but I think
[00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:13.660]   she got it.
[00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:14.660]   She understood.
[00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:17.280]   I mean, she understood my motivation around homeownership.
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:23.740]   She understood my interest in not having a payment that would be hanging over my head
[00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:25.340]   for so long.
[00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:27.580]   And to your point on investing, we did both.
[00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:29.460]   We invested and we paid off the mortgage.
[00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:35.220]   We maxed out our retirement during the time we were paying off our mortgage.
[00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:36.220]   And so we did both.
[00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:39.700]   And I understand sometimes it's a either or kind of thing.
[00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:42.860]   We saw this as an and opportunity, invest and pay off the mortgage.
[00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:46.960]   And now we're in a position where we have enough in our retirement funds that we feel
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:49.980]   like we can let that coast as well as having a paid off house.
[00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:51.540]   So life's good right now.
[00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:53.340]   Yeah.
[00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:57.380]   So it sounds like that was a great outcome and you guys got on the same page easily.
[00:22:57.380 --> 00:23:00.140]   I know you've talked in the past about things that you haven't necessarily gotten on the
[00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:01.140]   same page.
[00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:06.500]   Are there things that either you or people you talk to are common sources of frustration
[00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:09.660]   or arguments about money and ideas on how to tackle them?
[00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:10.660]   Yeah.
[00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:13.180]   I mean, I can tell you one that finishes that story.
[00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:19.260]   It's right around the time we paid off the mortgage, I got really excited about something
[00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:24.060]   else called financial independence and forgot to tell my wife about it.
[00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:29.220]   So when we paid off the house, I said, OK, now new goal, we're going to we're going to
[00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:33.260]   buy rental properties and we're going to keep saving half of our income.
[00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:37.120]   And that way we can keep buying rental properties until I'm able to kind of leave my nine to
[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:39.940]   five and just own rental properties.
[00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:40.940]   And that's what we're going to do.
[00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:41.940]   It's our financial independence plan.
[00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:46.260]   And she said, well, we've been saving so much for so long.
[00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:48.700]   Can we enjoy life a little bit?
[00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:53.100]   And, you know, vacation and travel and maybe I can upgrade this house that we've been living
[00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:54.740]   for a while.
[00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:59.940]   And I was so frustrated with my career at that point in life that and the fact that
[00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:04.060]   we had such little kids and I sort of lost it, man, I lost it in a bad way.
[00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:09.420]   I lost it and was very frustrated that my wife and I weren't seeing eye to eye on this
[00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:11.900]   this idea.
[00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:13.340]   And we had a really big glow up.
[00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:17.780]   We had a really big volcano type fight that she describes it as it was one of those things
[00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:22.500]   where we just were not seeing eye to eye on what to do with this money.
[00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:24.660]   We were in a very well off way.
[00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:27.340]   And, you know, obviously, people can fight when they don't have enough money and then
[00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:29.580]   people can fight when they have enough money.
[00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:32.860]   And we were fighting when we had a blessing of money coming in.
[00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:35.340]   We just did not agree on what to do with it.
[00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:39.660]   So what we ended up doing is going to marriage counseling.
[00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:45.300]   And it was one of those things that at the point I was like, man, I feel like I am failing
[00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:46.300]   this marriage.
[00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:49.540]   I feel like going to marriage counseling means that you are failing.
[00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:52.940]   And unfortunately, I was wrong.
[00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:54.500]   Fortunately, I was wrong for that matter.
[00:24:54.500 --> 00:25:00.100]   I went to my first session with with Nicole and found out that this wasn't something to
[00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:01.180]   be sad about.
[00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:06.420]   It was something that was providing us some coaching on actually how to speak better to
[00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:09.460]   each other, how to communicate better as a couple.
[00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:11.500]   We likened it to almost like a physical trainer.
[00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:16.100]   You know, if you want to you want to get stronger, you want to be healthier, you can outsource
[00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:19.400]   that to somebody who's a great third party coach that can show you how.
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:20.820]   And that's what our counselor did for us.
[00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:23.100]   They helped us to communicate better.
[00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:28.620]   And one thing that our counselor did for me was to allow me to empathize with my wife's
[00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:29.620]   situation a bit more.
[00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:36.180]   Hey, man, she was staying home as a stay-at-home mom and was taking care of two little kids
[00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:41.620]   for a really long time and wanted a little bit more joy and fun in her life.
[00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:48.260]   And her husband now wants to use all that extra money for more hard charging savings.
[00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:51.740]   And for her, that was just like, hey, come on, let's let our feet off the gas and have
[00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:56.220]   a little bit more fun and learning a little bit more during counseling about how she grew
[00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:57.220]   up.
[00:25:57.220 --> 00:26:00.220]   You know, she grew up with a single mom in an apartment.
[00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:06.300]   And for her, success meant a nice home and fun and excitement and vacations.
[00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:08.420]   And now that we have the money, we can't even do that.
[00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:15.100]   So we found some middle ground through our counseling sessions and through some conversations
[00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:20.000]   for us to both kind of realize some of our dreams and goals.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.620]   And again, sometimes that takes a third party to get there.
[00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:24.940]   And for us, it did.
[00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:30.020]   Any other interesting lessons or tactics that you learned through that process that were
[00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:31.020]   helpful?
[00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:32.020]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:36.500]   I would say that one thing that we liked to do during that time frame was let our kids
[00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:41.460]   know what was going on, because marriage isn't always easy.
[00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:44.540]   There are ups, there are downs.
[00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:51.760]   And letting our kids know that we were working hard to have a good relationship.
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:54.020]   And sometimes that means that you need some help.
[00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:57.220]   And so every time we went to our sessions, we would let our kids know.
[00:26:57.220 --> 00:27:00.500]   We would say, hey, mommy and daddy are working on our relationship.
[00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:04.460]   We're working on being able to communicate better with each other.
[00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:07.940]   And we are putting in the work, and we want you to know that.
[00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:09.840]   And so we wanted our kids to see that.
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:12.660]   We wanted them to know that marriage takes work.
[00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:16.780]   And just like any relationships that they have or will have in the future, if you care
[00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:19.960]   about it enough, you really have to put in the effort.
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:23.380]   So that was one thing that we definitely let our kids know about.
[00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:25.540]   Yeah, that's fascinating.
[00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:30.780]   My daughter's just turned one, so I'm in that struggle that I can't really communicate with
[00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:34.060]   her in the way I want to, but I'm really excited to do that.
[00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:38.020]   And I definitely, in a few minutes, want to jump into some of the things you're doing
[00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:39.020]   with your kids and money.
[00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:44.880]   But before that, something I often hear people talk about is the topic of combining finances.
[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:48.340]   And it's something that I think can go in a lot of directions, and people can do it
[00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:49.780]   different ways.
[00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:52.900]   Are you of the school of thought that there's a best way?
[00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:57.960]   Or how should couples whose finances maybe aren't combined and are thinking about it,
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:58.960]   think about it?
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:02.940]   Yeah, I definitely think this is an individual choice in your relationship.
[00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:05.020]   I don't think there's one right way.
[00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:09.660]   That being said, Nicole and I chose to combine our finances at the beginning of our relationship.
[00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:11.580]   We've looked back on it and being like, "Why did we do that?"
[00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:14.900]   I think it was just like, "That's how our parents did it," or "That's how we understood
[00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:15.900]   it to be."
[00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:17.500]   But yeah, there's multiple ways you can slice it.
[00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:21.060]   You can do completely combined, like Nicole and I do.
[00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:23.780]   Or you can do something like yours, mine, and ours.
[00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:28.020]   So you've got maybe their funds that they like to spend on, yours that you like to spend
[00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:29.020]   on.
[00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:32.400]   And then there's a collection of, "Hey, here are the things we like to spend on as a family."
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:34.060]   And then there's completely separate.
[00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:38.140]   And all of these work for different relationships in different ways.
[00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:41.980]   We found, and through conversations with other people, that when you add kids into the mix,
[00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:44.740]   that's when things can get a little bit more difficult, right?
[00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:47.300]   If you're completely separate, then where do diapers go?
[00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:49.080]   Who pays for those?
[00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:51.740]   Is that part of yours, or mine, or ours, or daycare?
[00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:53.020]   Where does that go?
[00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:58.540]   So I like joint because I feel like it means we are on a mission together.
[00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:01.400]   We're working on common goals.
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:03.020]   We're working as a team.
[00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:05.740]   But what we do is sort of like a little compromise.
[00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:10.220]   It's not yours, mine, and ours, but we do joint with individual budget line items.
[00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:12.860]   Because there are certain things that she really wants to have.
[00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:14.460]   Like she needs her haircuts.
[00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:15.460]   She needs her clothes.
[00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:16.700]   She needs her home decor.
[00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:20.820]   And these are all things that we have in our mint budget that are line itemed out.
[00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:22.340]   And she gets them no matter what.
[00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:24.180]   Oh, definitely one is the cleaning lady.
[00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:27.620]   I think I tried to frugal my way out of that.
[00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:28.620]   That did not go well.
[00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:34.500]   That was a highly valued line item that did not go well when I brought that up as something
[00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:36.980]   that maybe we should consider not having.
[00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:37.980]   But I've got the same thing.
[00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:41.640]   I've got some line items for my stuff, like guys night out and other things like that.
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:44.840]   So I think it's all particular.
[00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:46.280]   It's all particular to the couple.
[00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:51.240]   I would say maybe for second marriages, maybe there's a little bit more hesitancy in combining
[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:52.680]   everything together.
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:54.600]   And yeah, it all depends on your relationship.
[00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:58.740]   So I don't think there's one right way, but joint has worked for us.
[00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:02.460]   Yeah, a hybrid of joint that we do.
[00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:07.020]   And this really stemmed from, I was in a job where I had a lot of expenses for work.
[00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:11.600]   I was taking trips or if I was in a city, I might throw an event and put the event on
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:12.780]   my card.
[00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:20.020]   And so it became pretty stressful for my wife to see a credit card bill, be like, "Hey,
[00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:21.020]   why did you spend $20,000?"
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:22.480]   I'm like, "No, no, no.
[00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:27.700]   Actually, it's like $18,000 of work expenses and $2,000 of non-work."
[00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:29.340]   But to her, she's just like, "Well, I don't know.
[00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:30.340]   This is a bar.
[00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:31.340]   This is a flight.
[00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:32.340]   This is a hotel."
[00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:35.980]   And so we actually had a separate account and a separate credit card that I used for
[00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:38.620]   work stuff so that I could say, "Look, I'm going to put all this here."
[00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:43.620]   So it wasn't 100% joint because some things were work, but it was like reimbursable work
[00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:48.980]   versus if you have a business, I would highly recommend keeping that separate for both business
[00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:50.820]   tax reasons and other things.
[00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:54.220]   But sometimes if you're spending a lot of money for work and you don't have a corporate
[00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:58.340]   credit card, it can make sense to keep things separate just so people have an understanding
[00:30:58.340 --> 00:30:59.500]   of where things are going.
[00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:05.180]   And it's hard sometimes to monitor and get a sense of how much you're saving when the
[00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:09.260]   amount of money coming in and out is variable because of work expenses.
[00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:10.260]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:11.860]   So that was one thing that happened.
[00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:12.860]   And then gifts.
[00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:16.580]   So we still have our own separate credit cards that get paid out of a joint account just
[00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:19.660]   because I think we're the kinds of people that would see it and be like, "Oh, what's
[00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:20.660]   this?"
[00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:22.100]   It just doesn't matter.
[00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:26.220]   There's small enough expenses that I think for us, it's better to just keep on our own.
[00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:31.300]   And then we created a rule that we've evolved over time of if something's going to cost
[00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:34.980]   over X, and I think at one point in our relationship, it was $200.
[00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:37.940]   And I think now we're like, "Maybe we should upgrade it to $500."
[00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:40.860]   It's like, if it costs over that, let's talk about it.
[00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:44.240]   Otherwise, we trust each other and we don't have to say, "Should we do this?
[00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:45.600]   Can I go out to dinner with my friends?"
[00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:46.600]   And that kind of stuff.
[00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:47.920]   So that's what's worked for us.
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:52.320]   So joint checking, but separate credit cards and kind of a rule about spending.
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:53.320]   I like that a lot.
[00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:54.320]   Yeah.
[00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:55.320]   And I have a small business now.
[00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:59.840]   And so sometimes I'm able to lump some of the family expenses that used to be in our
[00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:01.600]   budget over there.
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:06.240]   For example, we have family photos that I ended up putting on my website and things
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:07.240]   like that.
[00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:08.760]   But they end up being great family photos for the family.
[00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:13.180]   So these are things that I can now put on my business expenses.
[00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:15.360]   But to your point, I get to go to conferences.
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:18.000]   I get to buy dinners and things like that.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.320]   And that can all be a business expense.
[00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:23.920]   So that can be sensitive if she doesn't have money for that type of stuff too.
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:27.280]   So just having open conversation about it has helped us.
[00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:28.960]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:30.600]   That's all money in marriage.
[00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:35.000]   But I know that you've talked a lot about things about marriage that aren't money-related
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.440]   and they show all the hacks.
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:41.680]   Are there relationship, marriage kind of tricks, hacks, things that you've used to have a successful
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:44.800]   relationship or enjoy more time together?
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:49.720]   Yeah, you know, one thing that I have used in my relationship and I talk to a lot of
[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:54.200]   other couples too is just knowing my spouse's love language.
[00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:56.760]   You know, this comes from that book, The Five Love Languages.
[00:32:56.760 --> 00:33:01.740]   And for Nicole, her language is time spent for sure and acts of service.
[00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:09.000]   So over the past few years, after consuming that book and understanding a little bit more
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:14.920]   about my wife's languages, I've started to create some habits for myself that allow for
[00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:19.760]   more time spent with her and more acts of service on the daily.
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:22.680]   So a couple of years ago, I'm like, "Okay, well, she loves coffee.
[00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:24.800]   What if I just bring her coffee in bed every day?"
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:28.940]   Because I always get up before her and she would probably really appreciate that.
[00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:34.800]   So over the past, I think, year and a half now, I bring her coffee in bed every day.
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:41.820]   And so I would say I'd give myself maybe a B plus, A minus with this over the last year.
[00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:46.160]   Maybe 300 out of the 365 days I've done this and she loves it.
[00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:53.440]   It's just one of those things where I understand who she is, I understand her styles for love,
[00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:56.640]   and it just sort of helps her to start her morning off on the right foot.
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:34:00.560]   So just kind of understanding a little bit about who your spouse is, how they like to
[00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:05.760]   be loved, can go a long way, because for a long while, I really like words of affirmation.
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:08.780]   When somebody says, "I'm doing a great job," or, "She loves me," or whatever, that makes
[00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:09.780]   me feel great.
[00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:11.680]   So for a while, I would just project that on her.
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:14.600]   I'd be like, "Well, I'm going to write her a note and tell her how great she is," or,
[00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:17.080]   "I'm going to verbally tell her."
[00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:20.040]   And for a while, it would just sort of like...
[00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:21.040]   It wouldn't connect.
[00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:22.600]   And I'd be like, "Well, what's wrong with her?
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:26.000]   I've given her all the love, but she doesn't feel it."
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.520]   I was just sort of loving her in the wrong way, until I learned that, "Hey, she really
[00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:34.240]   likes just time with you, man," or, "She really likes when you help around the house or do
[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:36.060]   nice things for her."
[00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:40.360]   So that took some trial and error on my part, but I'm still learning every day.
[00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:41.360]   Yeah.
[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:45.520]   If I'm sick, I'm the kind of person that would love someone to take care of me, come over
[00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:47.400]   and bring me a tea.
[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:50.440]   And my wife's like, "When I'm sick, I want to be left alone."
[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:53.880]   And so we had this whole challenge where I was like, "I want this," and she's like, "No,
[00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:54.880]   you don't need that."
[00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:58.880]   And I kind of realized, "Oh, you want something different from me, and I can give it to you,
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:00.200]   even though I don't want it."
[00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:02.840]   She's like, "But you also have to respect that I don't want it."
[00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:03.840]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:06.240]   And so in some cases, it can actually be too much.
[00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:07.240]   Absolutely.
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:13.960]   And so I actually have a running note on my phone that's just like subtle reminders.
[00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:18.440]   And anytime I notice something in our relationship, I just kind of write it down to make sure
[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:23.920]   I'm like, "Hey, Amy doesn't love this thing," or, "This is an opportunity to improve," or,
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:25.200]   "She really likes this."
[00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:30.400]   And one thing that I think's really helped in our relationship for me is, as I keep these
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:34.040]   notes, every now and then, I just kind of take a look at them.
[00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:37.400]   And I'm like, "Oh, this thing, she really liked this thing.
[00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:40.160]   Let's pick that thing up after work and bring it home."
[00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:44.640]   Or, "Let's just take a pause and just tell her about a few things this week that she's
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:45.920]   done that I really appreciate."
[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:52.240]   And these things are so easy for us to forget to do, and they're so easy.
[00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:56.600]   The act of pausing and just telling someone something meaningful they did or how they
[00:35:56.600 --> 00:36:00.520]   made you feel, it's such an easy thing that it's not fake.
[00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:01.520]   It's actually true.
[00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:02.600]   You actually feel it.
[00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:04.920]   Sometimes life gets so busy that you don't get to share it.
[00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:11.160]   So I try to keep a log of things that I appreciate her, just little things that she might like,
[00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:12.840]   and check it regularly.
[00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:15.640]   I don't actually have a calendar event, but I probably should.
[00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:18.760]   So I think it would add even more value if I did it more consistently.
[00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:19.760]   I think that's great.
[00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:20.760]   Yeah.
[00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:21.760]   I've got a similar list.
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:24.680]   It's right on my phone, the little notes app, and just kind of look at it every once in
[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:26.440]   a while or add things onto it.
[00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:30.360]   But yeah, to your point, if you could just like how we talk about hacking or habit stacking,
[00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:36.640]   it's like, "What can I do to make this a recurring thing that I do every day?"
[00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:42.320]   Even if it's just five, 10 minutes of an action that can go miles.
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:46.560]   One other thing that we didn't talk about, but you've talked about how it's kind of an
[00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:47.880]   impressive journey, right?
[00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:52.080]   You started at debt, paid it off in a year in advance of your child coming, then you
[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:57.120]   paid off a mortgage, and then in less than 10 years, you took that negative debt net
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:00.040]   worth all the way to a million dollars.
[00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:02.400]   What along that journey made that possible?
[00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:07.120]   Were you both on board with that kind of a goal and how did you get there so quickly?
[00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:11.120]   Yeah, it was a good story and a good successful journey.
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:16.240]   Obviously, a lot of it has to do with how much somebody can make, because this story
[00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:19.400]   for somebody making $50,000 a year would be a lot more difficult.
[00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:23.200]   We, on average, during that 10 years, we were making $190,000.
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:29.120]   And that's two working professionals in the Metro Detroit area.
[00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:33.800]   And we worked hard and got progressive raises and things like that to help.
[00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:41.060]   But a lot of it was just sort of growing that gap between what we spend and what we save.
[00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:46.440]   And having that gap helped us to consistently do some great things.
[00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:50.280]   In the beginning, it was using that gap to pay off our debt.
[00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:56.080]   And then it was, "Hey, let's max out our retirement accounts so that we have a great
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:38:00.440]   investment balance as we grow into the years that we actually need this money."
[00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:03.600]   And then again, with that gap, we paid off our mortgage.
[00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:09.440]   And a lot of the things that are in our net worth right now are a half a million dollar
[00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:13.940]   home and about a half a million dollars of investments, and then obviously cash and cars
[00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:16.680]   and things like that, kind of round everything out.
[00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:18.000]   But that's really it.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.360]   I mean, investing early and then paying off our home is what it is.
[00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:26.700]   So you think millionaire, and it sounds flashy with cars and watches and all that stuff.
[00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:28.160]   It's like, it's boring stuff, man.
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:35.640]   It's like a big old traditional IRA and a Roth IRA, HSA accounts, things like that,
[00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:37.000]   and for home and some cash.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.360]   And that's pretty much it.
[00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:44.000]   But a lot of it was from us just allowing ourselves to not inflate our lifestyle as
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.400]   we continue to grow our income.
[00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:50.400]   In the beginning, I was making $30,000 a year, and by the end of my career, I was making
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:52.260]   them closer to $200,000 a year.
[00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:58.520]   But we consistently lived on half during that time period, and we were able to enjoy life.
[00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:02.260]   I mean, obviously, even half of a lot of money is still a lot of money.
[00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:07.740]   So we vacationed, had fun, but we were able to do some incredible things that really helped
[00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:10.000]   our family create some freedom for ourselves.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.880]   It's been great.
[00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:17.880]   Any unusual things that you guys did to kind of grow that gap that, obviously, cutting
[00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:23.720]   things out of a budget or just being more frugal are regular things, but are there anything
[00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:25.120]   unusual in there?
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:30.040]   Honestly, none of it was too irregular, just consistently investing during the period,
[00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:32.000]   having some automation with our investing.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.920]   So it just happens without us even thinking about it.
[00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:40.040]   And over time, you look back and you say, "Wow, this balance is built up to an incredible
[00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:43.960]   amount by me just physically not doing anything, not touching it."
[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:48.060]   I feel like success with investing is less about what you do and more about what you
[00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:49.060]   don't do.
[00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:54.160]   It's just like, if I didn't touch this thing and see the balance grow as it has, that's
[00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:58.800]   really where we've found most of our success, just investing in low-cost index funds and
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:39:59.960]   letting it ride.
[00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:03.760]   We've had a very nice bull market over the past, whatever, eight to nine years that has
[00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:06.760]   helped us out quite a bit, but it's one of those things we're just going to stay on the
[00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:10.040]   roller coaster and see where it goes no matter what.
[00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:12.760]   Yeah, I love that.
[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:16.560]   I just want to thank you, Kwik, for listening to and supporting the show.

[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:33.000]   So we haven't talked about kids much, but you have two kids.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.320]   I have one kid.
[00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:37.480]   I haven't even thought much about children and money.
[00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:42.880]   But one of the stats that I think everyone really rubs into your head is, it costs about
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:44.720]   $200,000 to have a kid.
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:46.280]   It costs a million dollars to have a kid.
[00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:47.520]   I've seen everything.
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:49.560]   I've never seen anything that's lower than that.
[00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:53.480]   No one ever says, "Oh, no, no, it's actually only $100."
[00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:55.720]   So it's very clear that kids cost money.
[00:40:55.720 --> 00:41:00.600]   How do you feel about these numbers as someone who's put a lot of time into saving?
[00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:01.600]   Are they real?
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:03.360]   Are there ways to improve them?
[00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:04.360]   How do you think about it?
[00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:05.360]   Yeah.
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:06.360]   I mean, I wouldn't doubt that.
[00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:10.240]   I think I've seen the majority of the statistics I've seen is around $200,000, something like
[00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:11.800]   that, $200,000, $250,000.
[00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:12.800]   I believe it.
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:13.800]   I believe it.
[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:14.800]   Yeah.
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:15.800]   They got to eat.
[00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:16.800]   They got to go to school.
[00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:17.800]   They have to have clothes.
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:20.860]   You know, it's all that important stuff that needs to happen from zero to 18 years.
[00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:22.640]   But then college isn't even included that.
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:28.920]   And I think our in-state public university, by the time our kids go, is going to be about
[00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:31.680]   $200,000 for four years as well.
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:33.800]   So that's $400,000 because I've got two kids.
[00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:35.240]   And that's a crazy cost.
[00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:38.200]   But I mean, would I do it any differently?
[00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:39.200]   No.
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:40.200]   I love them.
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:41.200]   I love them.
[00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:42.200]   They're worth every penny.
[00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:46.080]   And I mean, talk about coming to your point on mathematical decisions.
[00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:52.180]   If I was thinking about math all of the time, then I definitely wouldn't have had children.
[00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:53.180]   But I do.
[00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:55.640]   It is hard to make an economic decision to have a child.
[00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:56.640]   Exactly.
[00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:57.640]   Exactly.
[00:41:57.640 --> 00:41:58.640]   And they are worth every penny.
[00:41:58.640 --> 00:41:59.760]   I love being with them.
[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:02.420]   And I mean, the college thing is different.
[00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:05.540]   That's again, that's going to be kind of tough to to swallow.
[00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:10.480]   And I'm not sure we're going to be able to get up to $400,000 of savings for them to
[00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:12.080]   experience college.
[00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:14.000]   But that's outside of that, no.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   Worth every penny.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.200]   And yeah, we'd do it all over again.
[00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:18.200]   Yeah.
[00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:20.920]   You've saved a lot, obviously, for yourselves.
[00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:25.840]   And I think one of the challenges that people who don't just have an abundance of unlimited
[00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:29.920]   money face is you've got your own life, and then you've got your kids' life.
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:33.800]   And in a perfect world, you could have all the money you need to do everything you want,
[00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:36.660]   give your children all the money they need to do anything they want.
[00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:39.840]   And that reality is just not true for most people.
[00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:46.640]   And so how do you balance saving for yourself versus saving for your kids or their education?
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:52.840]   And how do you think about whether you should deprive yourself from a few more vacations
[00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:58.160]   in order to leave them with enough money to pay for college and not have to take on debt?
[00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:01.920]   Yeah, again, I think that's all personal for each family.
[00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:06.640]   But for us, what we like to do is make sure that we're all set for retirement before we
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:10.760]   worry about our kids' college, because they can take student loans, but I can't take retirement
[00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:11.760]   loans.
[00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:14.620]   So it's one of those things where we want to make sure that we're all set.
[00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:15.720]   And we have been.
[00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:19.680]   We've gotten to ourselves to a position where we feel like we are going to be able to kind
[00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:23.720]   of coast to retirement and feel pretty comfortable with what we have.
[00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:26.720]   Outside of that, our kids value vacations.
[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:33.360]   So I think there's something to life experiences today in those 0 to 18 years that the kids
[00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:35.320]   are really going to remember.
[00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:38.440]   And them going to college isn't a for sure thing.
[00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:42.600]   They might not want to go to college or they might not have the drive to go to college.
[00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:43.940]   We're going to encourage them to.
[00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:45.520]   We want them to.
[00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:50.840]   But making time for fun today is very important to us.
[00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:54.640]   In fact, after we paid off our mortgage, that was one of the conversations that Nicole and
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:55.640]   I had.
[00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:59.480]   We value vacations so much that we need to be setting aside at least 10 percent of our
[00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:01.600]   income towards vacations.
[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:02.600]   And so that's what we did.
[00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:06.800]   We sort of filter that money into a different account that's outside of our checking account
[00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:09.720]   that just sits there and starts to build up so that when we look back, we're like, oh,
[00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:10.880]   man, we got five grand in there.
[00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:11.960]   Where are we going to go?
[00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:12.960]   You know?
[00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:14.560]   And then if we use travel hacking, we can go even further.
[00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:16.280]   So that became a priority of ours.
[00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:21.640]   So when people talk about making memories and making fun for it, yeah, if you've saved
[00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:25.480]   up and you are not paying high interest credit card debt and you're checking the boxes to
[00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:31.080]   save towards retirement monies, monies for fun, man, you use your money and enjoy your
[00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:32.080]   life.
[00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:33.080]   I mean, yes.
[00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:34.080]   Check those important boxes.
[00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:38.860]   Make sure you're not going into credit card debt to to experience all these things.
[00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:42.600]   But if you're checking all the boxes, all the important financial things to do, you've
[00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:46.920]   got enough saved in an emergency, you've paid off your high interest credit card debt and
[00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:54.360]   you are saving for retirement, then yes, enjoy life and bring the kids along with you.
[00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:59.040]   And what would you say to someone who's like, gosh, I just really struggle with the idea
[00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:05.660]   of spending more money and enjoying my life, knowing that I'm not putting it towards my
[00:45:05.660 --> 00:45:08.560]   kids college and that they might have to take on debt?
[00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:09.560]   How do you think about that?
[00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:11.440]   Because I think you're a very rational person.
[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:15.080]   We've talked to lots of people about this, and I think that's something I struggle with
[00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:17.440]   is how do you balance that?
[00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:20.400]   And obviously you want enough to take a trip, but do you take two trips?
[00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:21.400]   Do you take three trips?
[00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:26.200]   Is there a point at which you kind of balance and start to save for both?
[00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:30.240]   I think college has a lot more ways to slice it than people think.
[00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:35.640]   Obviously, you can invest and save at an early age through a 529 that can help you build
[00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:37.360]   up a good balance.
[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:41.720]   When they get to that point, let's say you don't have enough, scholarships can be earned.
[00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:47.300]   You can spend some time on the weekends before they graduate where they're filling out scholarship
[00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:49.320]   applications each weekend.
[00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:53.600]   You pump enough of those things out there, you can get tens of thousands of dollars towards
[00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:54.600]   college, for sure.
[00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:57.920]   I've talked to enough families that say, this is a reality.
[00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:00.680]   This is something we did to pay for my entire college experience.
[00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:04.020]   It just requires time, dedication.
[00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:06.440]   They can also work in high school.
[00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:12.240]   They can get some experience, understand what it means to do hard work and save up for something.
[00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:14.120]   They can also work in college.
[00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:19.360]   There are ways to hack college a little easier than just saying, hey, I better have every
[00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:23.640]   single penny to make sure we've got enough for them to go to college because otherwise
[00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:25.820]   they're going to be trapped in student loan debt.
[00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:26.820]   There are different ways to do it.
[00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:30.640]   They can go to community college for the first couple of years and get their credits at a
[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:35.500]   fraction of the price and then still finish their degree at the university if they want.
[00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:36.860]   There are ways to do it.
[00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:40.840]   I just think sometimes we just take things at face value and I know that I have in the
[00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:44.880]   past when I took on my student loans, you just take it as face value and you just go
[00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:48.800]   to the university and you pay it and say, well, everybody's taking on student loans.
[00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:49.800]   You don't have to.
[00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:52.800]   You can do things a little differently and there's lots of different routes to do it.
[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:53.800]   Yeah.
[00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:58.400]   I mean, I think something important there is a lot of us in college, we hadn't really
[00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:01.200]   figured out money and so we took things at face value.
[00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:03.680]   We did what we thought we were supposed to do.
[00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:09.460]   Are you thinking about helping your kids understand money from an earlier age than maybe you did?
[00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:10.460]   Absolutely.
[00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:11.460]   Yeah.
[00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:12.460]   And we have started that.
[00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:16.140]   Ever since I think Zoe was four years old, we've done like a chore and reward program
[00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:17.180]   at the house.
[00:47:17.180 --> 00:47:21.300]   So every, actually now it's a daily thing with the kids.
[00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:26.900]   So they come home from camp or school and they've got one chore that they need to do
[00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:28.220]   to help the family.
[00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:31.340]   So they're understanding that they need to contribute.
[00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:34.060]   They need to help around the house.
[00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:38.420]   Ever since they were young, it's either emptying the little garbage cans around the house,
[00:47:38.420 --> 00:47:41.740]   using the little vacuum to clean things, doing laundry.
[00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:47.760]   My son is seven years old and he knows how to do laundry and I know some 18, 20-year-olds
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:48.760]   that don't know how to do laundry.
[00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:49.940]   My seven-year-old knows how to do it.
[00:47:49.940 --> 00:47:55.880]   And so we're teaching them life skills, but then also giving them money to mess up with.
[00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:59.640]   So we give them a dollar for every year they've lived.
[00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:06.360]   So Zoe gets $9, Calvin gets $7, and we now direct deposit that directly into their Ally
[00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:08.440]   savings accounts or their checking accounts.
[00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:10.120]   They have their own debit cards.
[00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:13.720]   So when they want to purchase something, they've got enough money in their checking account
[00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:15.440]   to do that.
[00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:19.560]   And I have conversations with my daughter about understanding that there's shipping,
[00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:21.680]   there's tax, there's things like that.
[00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:26.160]   These conversations are happening early enough where I feel like she's going to be a smart,
[00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:28.600]   educated, young woman.
[00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:30.240]   And yes, are there mistakes?
[00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:31.240]   Yes.
[00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:36.240]   I'm so glad that they're making mistakes now at nine and seven as opposed to 29 and 27
[00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:41.300]   when it's $50,000 instead of maybe $5 that we're dealing with with the mistakes.
[00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:44.880]   So I'm excited about those conversations that we're having together.
[00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:46.000]   They're learning hard work.
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:49.040]   They're learning that with that hard work, they get a reward.
[00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:54.640]   And not only are we talking about spending with them, but we also divide their earnings
[00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:55.760]   into other buckets.
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:59.640]   So they've got an investment bucket, they've got a savings bucket, and they've also got
[00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:04.880]   a giving bucket because we feel in our family that it's important to give back as well because
[00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:08.200]   not only it's the right thing to do in society, but we've had some privilege in our life,
[00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:09.640]   so we feel like we have to give back.
[00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:12.800]   So we have a conversation with them every three months where they sort of empty that
[00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:17.640]   digital giving jar, and we talk about what they're feeling grateful for, what they're
[00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:20.160]   feeling excited about in life.
[00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:24.920]   And then we talk about charities that honor that thanks to people who maybe don't have
[00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:25.920]   that.
[00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:28.400]   So for example, my son is really happy with the house that he has.
[00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:29.920]   He really likes having a roof over his head.
[00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:33.520]   So he gives to a charity called Say Detroit that helps people who don't have homes in
[00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:35.000]   Metro Detroit.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.960]   And he's given to that charity now for two years.
[00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:43.280]   We wrote a little letter to Mitch Albom who runs that charity, and he featured Calvin
[00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:46.680]   on his radio show at, I think it was four years old, five years old.
[00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:51.080]   And that was one of those moments where I'm like, man, my son, he might not remember this,
[00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:52.960]   but I'm going to keep that video.
[00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:55.880]   And it's going to be one of those things that he's going to be like, yeah, I've been given
[00:49:55.880 --> 00:49:57.480]   since I was four or five.
[00:49:57.480 --> 00:50:02.280]   And he understands the power of that and understands that money can not only do great things for
[00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:05.500]   your life, but it can also do great things for other people who are in need.
[00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:09.400]   So we're having lots of conversations with the kids, and I hope that they come away with
[00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:13.640]   something after this 18 years in our house.
[00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:14.640]   That's awesome.
[00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:17.720]   Are there any things you've learned about teaching kids money that maybe weren't so
[00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:19.600]   obvious that have been really helpful?
[00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:23.320]   Yeah, you know, in the beginning, we would give them the money and we say, hey, here
[00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:26.040]   it is in your account, you know, enjoy it and spend it.
[00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:29.800]   And then it was one of those things that we were dealing with contentment problems.
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:31.560]   So they would buy something.
[00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:35.600]   And then 10 minutes later, they'd be like, all right, this isn't any fun anymore.
[00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:37.000]   Can I buy something else right now?
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:38.680]   And in the beginning, it was like, oh, yeah, sure.
[00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:39.680]   You got the money in your account.
[00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:40.680]   Yeah, go ahead.
[00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:43.740]   And then it was one of those things where it's like, man, we're creating little consumers.
[00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:45.080]   We're creating little crazy consumers.
[00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:46.080]   They bought this thing.
[00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:47.680]   They used it for 10 minutes.
[00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:50.000]   And now it's all sitting over in the corner, a little plastic thing.
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:51.280]   And now they're going to buy the next thing.
[00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:54.040]   And then Nicole and I were like, whoa, whoa, whoa, we got to stop this.
[00:50:54.040 --> 00:50:55.040]   This is a little crazy.
[00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:58.600]   We're going to limit the purchases to once a month.
[00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:00.960]   You guys enjoy the toys you can buy.
[00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:01.960]   Buy what you have.
[00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:03.100]   You've got the money in there.
[00:51:03.100 --> 00:51:04.800]   Enjoy it for a while.
[00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:08.600]   And then next month, we can try something new because we don't want to just create little
[00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:14.480]   mindless spenders because then they're going to say, hey, man, this thing doesn't give
[00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:15.600]   me the happiness that I want.
[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:17.300]   I need something else right away.
[00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:18.400]   And that's not what we want.
[00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:23.160]   We do want them to understand that not every toy is going to be fantastic, but we also
[00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:26.640]   don't want to have them buying things over and over again because Nicole is more of like
[00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:29.360]   sort of a minimalist kind of design in the home.
[00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:30.840]   And she doesn't really like a lot of clutter.
[00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:34.560]   So when we've got a lot of things in here, it's either, can we sell this on Facebook?
[00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:37.320]   Can we give it away or do something else with it?
[00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:40.360]   Have you taught the kids to start selling stuff on Facebook Marketplace?
[00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:41.360]   Yeah.
[00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:43.560]   Zoe is currently, she's got what she got listed.
[00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:45.120]   She's got a couple of posters listed.
[00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:46.480]   She's got some toys listed.
[00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:48.560]   Calvin's selling some Beyblades right now.
[00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:54.120]   He just got 15 bucks for some old toys and that's going to go into his digital jars.
[00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:55.280]   So yeah, we do it together.
[00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:56.960]   We take the photos together.
[00:51:56.960 --> 00:52:00.340]   Zoe's gotten old enough where she can kind of input the description and the photos and
[00:52:00.340 --> 00:52:01.440]   kind of do it all herself.
[00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:04.360]   So Calvin requires a little bit more help from dad.
[00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:10.200]   I just am now imagining like my childhood of like the garage sale is now like the digital
[00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:11.480]   online garage sale.
[00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:12.480]   Oh yeah.
[00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:15.400]   Facebook Marketplace is fantastic because you can ship all around the country and they
[00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:16.400]   print out the label for you.
[00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:19.600]   It just kind of creates it a little, makes it a little easier.
[00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:20.600]   I love that.
[00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:23.600]   Now, again, outside of money with kids, I'm a new dad.
[00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:24.600]   I've got a one-year-old.
[00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:27.040]   I've got a journey ahead of me.
[00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:30.680]   What advice do you have for me to make both the journey with the children and the journey
[00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:33.320]   with the family more efficient, more better?
[00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:34.320]   Yeah.
[00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:35.320]   Yeah.
[00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:39.320]   I remember, I especially remember the young, young years, especially with my kids, I would
[00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:44.520]   say a lot of it has to do with making the space and time to learn how they also like
[00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:45.960]   to be loved.
[00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:47.680]   Calvin is very much like his mother.
[00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:48.680]   He likes time.
[00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:52.280]   He likes time with his dad and he likes words of affirmation.
[00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:57.240]   And then my daughter's always more about like cuddling and affection and, you know, just
[00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:58.680]   kind of being close to each other.
[00:52:58.680 --> 00:53:03.220]   So learning how your kids like to be loved is also important.
[00:53:03.220 --> 00:53:08.400]   And I've learned that over the years that they like different things and they require
[00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:10.080]   different attention.
[00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:15.240]   And with that attention, I have dedicated one-on-one time with them each month.
[00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:20.120]   So Calvin will get one month and then Zoe will get another where they get to choose
[00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:21.360]   for two to three hours.
[00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:25.360]   We're going to go do something, whatever you want to do, we're going to go wherever you
[00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:26.360]   want to go.
[00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:30.160]   Calvin likes to go to like a play place with like trampolines and stuff like that.
[00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:32.840]   Zoe likes to go see Marvel movies.
[00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:38.080]   So just creating that dedicated time where I'm giving them all of me and putting away
[00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:41.920]   my phone and turning it off is really great for us.
[00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:46.800]   And when you've got multiple kids in the house, it can lead to some, you know, sort of resentment
[00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:47.800]   and some jealousy.
[00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:50.760]   So when you're able to give that dedicated time, that's been very helpful.
[00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:54.600]   I got that, I got that, you know, a hack from a great book that I read called The Family
[00:53:54.600 --> 00:54:00.840]   Board Meeting by Jim Shields, where he talks about this concept of 18 summers.
[00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:07.200]   We only have 18 summers before our kids are off to college or off to doing their own thing.
[00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:12.440]   So how can we make that time really special and how can we make some great memories together?
[00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:15.680]   So that one-on-one time has been really special for us.
[00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:16.840]   Yeah.
[00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:21.000]   Any other, I haven't read a lot of books on family and parenting.
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:22.800]   It's all a little new.
[00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:24.600]   Any other recommendations there?
[00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:29.880]   Well, as far as the, on the marriage side of things, I really liked this book from the
[00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:33.800]   Holderness family called Everybody Fights, so why not get better at it?
[00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:39.000]   And it's a, this is a family that is very popular on YouTube and online, but they wrote
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:41.880]   this book because they often fight.
[00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:47.520]   They're pretty emotional, excited kind of people, but they, they talk about ways to
[00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:52.120]   make fighting, because it's inevitable, ways to make fighting easier.
[00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:56.720]   And one hack that they had in the book was just sort of being like, "Hey, if you've just
[00:54:56.720 --> 00:55:02.320]   recently been in a fight, try to think about what's an easy trigger that it caused.
[00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:03.920]   Were you guys drinking?
[00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:05.040]   Was somebody really tired?
[00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:06.040]   Was somebody hangry?
[00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:10.120]   Did something add to this that made it even more intense?"
[00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:14.560]   And sort of like recognize that as you guys are describing this horrible fight that you've
[00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:18.560]   been in now, and maybe have some humility and say, "Hey, you know what?
[00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:22.760]   I was a little bit more tired than I normally was because I was sort of, whatever, day drinking,
[00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:28.320]   or I had not gotten good sleep the night before," or whatever it was, and just sort of, you
[00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:30.840]   know, approaching the fight with some humility.
[00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:33.600]   Also, understanding how people like to fight.
[00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:38.880]   Like for example, Nicole, when we get into fights, she needs some space afterward.
[00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:43.200]   Like I'm always the one who wants to like quick fix it, being like, "Okay, let's resolve
[00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:44.200]   this right now.
[00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:45.200]   Let's talk through it."
[00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:46.200]   And she's like, "No, dude.
[00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:47.200]   I need to, I need to kind of go away.
[00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:48.960]   I need some space."
[00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:54.560]   And so, sort of understanding how people like to fight, how people like to resolve things
[00:55:54.560 --> 00:55:57.760]   was a good concept in that book, and I really enjoyed it.
[00:55:57.760 --> 00:55:58.760]   Yeah.
[00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:02.800]   I learned that the hard way, which is I'm like you.
[00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:06.480]   We're arguing about something, and I'm like, "Let's just see if we can resolve this thing
[00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:07.480]   right now."
[00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:11.640]   And in our relationship, one of the ways to get your point across is to find the most
[00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:13.160]   effective time to present it.
[00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:16.040]   And for me, it's not right after a conflict.
[00:56:16.040 --> 00:56:17.640]   It's not right before bed.
[00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:22.560]   Like I know that those 2 times make it less compelling for me to get my point across.
[00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:27.640]   And so, in the same way that if I want to try to present an idea at work, I'm going
[00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:32.080]   to put the time and energy into, "When's the right time to share it with my team?"
[00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:34.280]   Maybe put together a presentation.
[00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:38.880]   I just apply similar thoughts to, "Okay, when's the right time to present this idea?"
[00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:42.940]   I think maybe we should take an extra vacation this year.
[00:56:42.940 --> 00:56:45.880]   It's not something that I want to bring up.
[00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:48.680]   If we're going to bed, it's like, "Hey, I know you're about to fall asleep, but do you
[00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:51.880]   want to have this big conversation about how we could spend some money on a trip?"
[00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:53.400]   It doesn't go well.
[00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:56.720]   And for me, I've tried to explain, "Well, look, I don't want to...
[00:56:56.720 --> 00:56:57.720]   We don't need to talk about it now.
[00:56:57.720 --> 00:57:00.800]   But just know that the reason I'm bringing it up isn't because we have to.
[00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:01.800]   I'm just so excited."
[00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:06.400]   And so, it goes back to something you said earlier, which is understanding the motivations
[00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:09.440]   behind why people do things is really important.
[00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:10.440]   Absolutely.
[00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:11.440]   Yeah.
[00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:12.440]   So, I want to encourage that.
[00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:13.440]   "Don't go to bed angry."
[00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:15.820]   You know, that adage where it's like, "No, no, no.
[00:57:15.820 --> 00:57:18.660]   I just need to go to bed."
[00:57:18.660 --> 00:57:19.660]   Yeah.
[00:57:19.660 --> 00:57:20.660]   Yeah.
[00:57:20.660 --> 00:57:23.340]   And understanding that is often very helpful.
[00:57:23.340 --> 00:57:24.340]   Absolutely.
[00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:30.100]   I talked about it in the introduction here, but what led you to be someone who decided
[00:57:30.100 --> 00:57:31.820]   this was going to be your career, right?
[00:57:31.820 --> 00:57:35.140]   You quit your job and you now run Marriage, Kids, and Money.
[00:57:35.140 --> 00:57:36.140]   And you've got videos.
[00:57:36.140 --> 00:57:37.140]   You've got a podcast.
[00:57:37.140 --> 00:57:38.140]   You've got a blog.
[00:57:38.140 --> 00:57:41.340]   How do you describe how that became your thing?
[00:57:41.340 --> 00:57:42.340]   Yeah.
[00:57:42.340 --> 00:57:46.140]   About five years ago, I was having a really bad day at work.
[00:57:46.140 --> 00:57:51.500]   And it was one of those things where we got new management at the company.
[00:57:51.500 --> 00:57:54.940]   And with that new management, all of a sudden they made some changes on the teams.
[00:57:54.940 --> 00:57:57.420]   They said, "Andy, you're not on that team anymore.
[00:57:57.420 --> 00:57:58.420]   You're on this team.
[00:57:58.420 --> 00:58:00.780]   And the people reporting to you are now not reporting to you.
[00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:01.780]   You're reporting to this guy."
[00:58:01.780 --> 00:58:07.580]   And it was one of those things where I was like, "Man, I don't really have any ownership
[00:58:07.580 --> 00:58:11.060]   of my life here at this career.
[00:58:11.060 --> 00:58:15.140]   It's something that I feel like I'm not in control of."
[00:58:15.140 --> 00:58:18.540]   And at home, I've got two very young kids at the time.
[00:58:18.540 --> 00:58:21.620]   They've got a three-year-old and a one-year-old, and I have no control there either.
[00:58:21.620 --> 00:58:25.960]   So, I'm like, "Okay, what's something that I can do that's sort of like a hobby, something
[00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:30.220]   that I can grab onto that just makes me feel like, I don't know, I need something?"
[00:58:30.220 --> 00:58:33.420]   And so, I had been listening to podcasts around that time, and I said, "Well, why don't I
[00:58:33.420 --> 00:58:34.420]   just start a podcast?
[00:58:34.420 --> 00:58:35.420]   I think that could be fun.
[00:58:35.420 --> 00:58:36.420]   I have something to share.
[00:58:36.420 --> 00:58:37.420]   I want to learn from people.
[00:58:37.420 --> 00:58:40.220]   It could be a great way as an outlet."
[00:58:40.220 --> 00:58:41.220]   So, I did that.
[00:58:41.220 --> 00:58:44.740]   I decided to start Marriage, Kids and Money in 2016, and it was one of those things where
[00:58:44.740 --> 00:58:48.220]   I'd share a little bit about our journey, and then I would interview really smart people
[00:58:48.220 --> 00:58:51.660]   that would help us on our journey, or just help people who are listening as well.
[00:58:51.660 --> 00:58:56.460]   And then over time, people started to listen, which was great, outside of my wife and my
[00:58:56.460 --> 00:58:57.900]   mom, which was awesome.
[00:58:57.900 --> 00:59:02.660]   And I started to get some podcast sponsors, and then people wanted to work with me on
[00:59:02.660 --> 00:59:03.660]   different things.
[00:59:03.660 --> 00:59:06.840]   And so, it started to become not just a hobby, but a side hustle.
[00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:12.300]   And then over time, it started to grow even more, and it got to a point where I had amassed
[00:59:12.300 --> 00:59:18.980]   enough money and savings, and we had done well enough in our financial life, where it
[00:59:18.980 --> 00:59:21.100]   was one of those things where it's like, "Let's take a risk.
[00:59:21.100 --> 00:59:26.100]   Let's take a jump and try to do something that's not, I don't know, prescriptive, like
[00:59:26.100 --> 00:59:27.600]   what I'm supposed to do."
[00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:30.860]   And Nicole was very—actually, she encouraged me to do it, really.
[00:59:30.860 --> 00:59:34.700]   So, I took the leap to do it full-time in January 2020.
[00:59:34.700 --> 00:59:40.700]   I had some contracts, I had some sponsorships, things were kind of set in place.
[00:59:40.700 --> 00:59:45.220]   And yes, it was two months right before the pandemic hit, but a year and a half later,
[00:59:45.220 --> 00:59:46.220]   I'm still standing.
[00:59:46.220 --> 00:59:50.940]   So, there was lots of ups and downs with different contracts and clients and partnerships and
[00:59:50.940 --> 00:59:51.940]   things like that.
[00:59:51.940 --> 00:59:54.300]   But all in all, we've been doing well.
[00:59:54.300 --> 00:59:55.300]   Life's good.
[00:59:55.300 --> 00:59:56.380]   Things are growing well.
[00:59:56.380 --> 00:59:59.300]   I really love the work that I do every single day.
[00:59:59.300 --> 01:00:03.580]   I get to learn, I get to help people.
[01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:06.300]   And at the end of the day, I'm extremely happy.
[01:00:06.300 --> 01:00:09.660]   I'm doing work that I love, and I'm able to be paid for it.
[01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:13.020]   So, that's life to me, man.
[01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:15.640]   Yeah, I'm a big fan of all your work.
[01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:16.980]   Where can people find it?
[01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:19.740]   What are the different avenues that you produce content for?
[01:00:19.740 --> 01:00:20.740]   Absolutely.
[01:00:20.740 --> 01:00:23.180]   Well, if you're listening to this podcast, the best thing to do is just to type in Marriage
[01:00:23.180 --> 01:00:25.620]   Kids and Money and your favorite podcast player.
[01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:27.860]   That is the great place to connect with me.
[01:00:27.860 --> 01:00:31.980]   We do YouTube videos as well, so if you're a YouTube person, you can type in Marriage
[01:00:31.980 --> 01:00:33.580]   Kids and Money there as well.
[01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:35.540]   Well, thank you so much for being on here.
[01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:36.540]   Thanks, Chris.
