[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.840]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.640]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.280]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.680]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio to your children's
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.200]   education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.120]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.400]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.960]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's totally
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.840]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.960]   You heard about it here.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.640]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:43.760]   Hello and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.000]   life, money and travel all while spending less and saving more.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.280]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins.
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.120]   And before we jump in, I just want to thank all of you for your support because
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.760]   this show has already grown beyond my expectations.
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.480]   In fact, it's gotten so big that I've decided to start looking for someone to
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.440]   help out part-time.
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.360]   That includes everything from reaching out to guests, helping edit episodes,
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.640]   creating social media posts and so much more.
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.960]   I thought I'd share this with you first in case there's a listener out there
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.440]   looking for their own side hustle.
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.720]   So if you're interested, please shoot me an email at chris@allthehacks.com.
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.360]   Okay, so this week we're talking to Andy Hill, the founder of the award-winning
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.800]   podcast and blog Marriage, Kids and Money.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.920]   He and his wife, Nicole, have two kids and have been on an incredible journey
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:29.440]   together.
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.760]   They started out with $50,000 in debt when they found out they were having a
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.360]   child and aggressively saved to be debt-free before she was born.
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.880]   But they didn't stop there.
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.920]   Over the next 10 years, they managed to pay off their mortgage and build their
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.760]   net worth to over a million dollars.
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.880]   In this episode, we'll talk about how they managed to do all of that.
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.440]   We'll get Andy's relationship hacks, especially about how to manage money with
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.040]   your spouse and learn what he's doing to teach his kids all about money.
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.920]   I'm really looking forward to this one.
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.920]   But before we jump in, I have to remind you, Chris Hutchins works at Wealthfront.
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.040]   All opinions expressed by Chris and his guests are solely their own opinions and
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.880]   do not reflect the opinion of Wealthfront.
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.080]   This podcast is for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon for
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.040]   investment decisions.
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.800]   Andy, thanks for being here.
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:15.880]   Thanks for having me, Chris.
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:16.440]   Appreciate it.
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.360]   Yeah, it's always fun to get to talk to someone on a podcast that you've known
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.880]   for a bit.
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.840]   We've met at FinCon a few times, so this is really exciting and I want to jump
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:25.240]   right in.
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.160]   Absolutely.
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.440]   I'm in.
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:32.520]   So, you've built an entire brand around marriage, kids and money, and we haven't
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.920]   really delved in this show into the marriage or the kids.
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.360]   We've talked a lot about money, so I want to start off on the relationship side and
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.000]   just understand, what do you think some of the common misconceptions are when it
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.640]   comes to relationships and money?
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.120]   Oh man, I think personally, and then I think of some of the folks that I've been
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.400]   able to speak to on the show, but one thing that pops up into my brain, just
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.920]   because you're one couple doesn't mean you think with one brain, right?
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:07.480]   So, we've said yes, we've said I do, but that doesn't mean that our ideas and our
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.520]   concepts around money are the same.
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.120]   And I know that's definitely not the case with my wife and I.
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.680]   And as we got married, we didn't have a lot of those conversations beforehand.
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:22.440]   We didn't have a lot of those discussions on our finances, where we wanted to go,
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.400]   our dreams, our goals, things like that beforehand.
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.840]   But those definitely came up well after the fact, after we were married and we
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.320]   realized that we definitely had quite a bit of differences with regard to our
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.200]   finances and our goals and things like that.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.160]   And only through conversation were we able to improve that.
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.320]   And I've definitely seen that through a lot of the couples that I've
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.600]   interviewed on the show too.
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:51.000]   It's just because you are one couple doesn't mean you share one brain, for sure.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.200]   And, you know, outside of that, I would say, you know, another maybe common
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:01.040]   misconception is that marriage is like an action and that it happens on that day.
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.840]   You're done, right?
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:02.760]   You know, we've got married.
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.440]   We crossed the aisle and said, I do, but it's really a verb.
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.520]   It's action-based.
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:14.240]   It's one of those things that requires consistent work and it evolves over time.
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.760]   And you need to be ready for that change.
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.680]   And if you're stagnant and you say, Hey, this is how we've always done it.
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:21.800]   This is who I am.
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.280]   That's when I've seen relationships fall apart.
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.800]   And I even see that with my relationship with my wife, where it's one of those
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:34.040]   things, if I am just saying, Hey, this is how we've always done it, you know, deal
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.080]   with it, that's when things don't go well.
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.760]   So those are some of the common misconceptions that I've seen.
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:39.040]   Yeah.
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.360]   I think to your first one, it's interesting how I don't think anyone
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.960]   believes that their spouse and them have to have the same favorite food, right?
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.280]   They have to have the same like favorite vacation style.
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.280]   And you make that work.
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.560]   You go on, my wife and I went on a trip and you know, maybe one day I want to go
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.080]   see something crazy that she doesn't.
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.520]   So she comes along one day, she wants to do something.
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.200]   I do that.
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.920]   And that's totally fine.
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.320]   Is that harder with money?
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:07.920]   Is there, are there ways to have a kind of approach to money that meets two
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.560]   different attitudes or two different styles, or do you really need to try to
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.080]   merge them and find one way to manage your money together?
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:19.640]   I think a lot of it just comes from a few things, understanding where
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.720]   your spouse comes from with money.
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:25.320]   We are, we are who we are today based on our history.
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.400]   And that sometimes comes from our upbringing.
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.640]   That comes from how our parents raised us.
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.760]   So, well, my parents raised me in a different way than my wife did.
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:38.200]   Other couples, the same thing, but some of those realizations don't come up until
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:42.320]   later on when there's some real strife or so maybe money fights that are
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:46.680]   happening that pop up, well, I've always thought this way and you think this way.
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:47.520]   That's wrong.
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.280]   You know, I, I know that this is right.
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:49.840]   This is wrong.
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.520]   It's not wrong.
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:52.920]   It's just different.
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.480]   And for me, for a while in our relationship, I had that hardheaded
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.880]   mentality of, Hey, I've been reading about money.
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.440]   I know money stuff.
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:02.600]   This is correct.
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.960]   And what you're thinking of is wrong, but really it's not wrong.
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.480]   It's just a different way of thinking.
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:13.600]   And so until I took my stubborn hat off and put my empathy shoes on, I didn't
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:18.320]   really take the time to understand her position, but when I did that, then I
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:21.880]   could really take her position and understand where she's coming from.
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:24.680]   And I know that helps out a lot of couples when you're able to do that,
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:29.080]   when you're able to think in terms of their feelings and their situation
[00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:30.240]   and maybe where they're coming from.
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:34.400]   So a good example of this is at the beginning of our relationship, Nicole
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.880]   and I, I got really geeked about paying off our debt, I got really
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.440]   excited about becoming debt-free.
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:40.720]   I thought that idea was really cool.
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:45.480]   We had $50,000 of debt, you know, 30,000 student loans and 20,000 car loan.
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:49.240]   And I'm like, I think it would be really great to be debt-free by the
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.440]   time our daughter comes into the world.
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:54.240]   We learned that we were going to be parents talking about becoming parents.
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:57.640]   And I said, that's a way that I can be a good father and protect this
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.560]   family that's going to be moving forward.
[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:05.000]   So I said, hey, why don't we, you know, get rid of your luxury car and maybe
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.280]   spend a lot less money and then we'll pay off $50,000 in debt in one year.
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.280]   What do you think of that idea?
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:13.760]   And she immediately said, are you crazy?
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:14.920]   That sounds horrible.
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:16.160]   That sounds like deprivation.
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.840]   And it sounds like you want me to get rid of my car.
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:18.320]   What was that?
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.760]   And then she just sort of like walked out of the room and I'm like, wait, no, no,
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:22.120]   no, no, this is a fantastic plan.
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:22.800]   Where are you going?
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:23.880]   Why, why?
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:27.920]   And what I realized is that I wasn't speaking her language at all.
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:32.520]   Really, I was speaking in numbers and facts and figures and she
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:33.880]   didn't really talk that language.
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:37.280]   And so after I, you know, picked myself back up and had some more
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:41.520]   conversations with her, I started to understand more of her motivation.
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.160]   What, what, what, what is her motivation?
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.720]   Well, she's excited about being a mother too.
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:48.440]   And she really doesn't dig the job that she's in.
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:49.560]   Okay.
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:52.480]   This is an opportunity for us to look at ways that we can both win.
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.920]   I would love this debt-free life.
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:57.920]   And you'd eventually like to go from maybe full-time working at a job you
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:02.120]   don't really like to maybe part-time or eventually full-time stay-at-home mom.
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:04.440]   And that's where we started to connect a little bit.
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:07.240]   I talked more of the number side of things originally.
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:11.200]   And then I started talking more of the emotional benefits of what you can do
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.160]   when you work together in your finances.
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:17.520]   So I think just sort of realigning your language can help quite a bit
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.680]   when it comes to marriage and money.
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:22.320]   And I've definitely learned that and failed at it quite a few
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.600]   times in our 11-year marriage.
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.520]   Yeah, but you're still married 11 years later.
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:27.120]   We still are.
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:27.600]   Yes.
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:28.480]   Got that going for me.
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:33.720]   Are there questions that you would tell people to start asking whether they're
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:37.520]   early in a relationship or, or haven't really gone deep that you think can kind
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:41.560]   of bring out some of these, you know, potential issues in the future that
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:43.240]   would let them get on the same page?
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:43.760]   Yeah.
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:47.520]   You know, I've talked about that with couples who are dating or maybe in that
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:51.480]   sort of engagement phase where it's like, Hey, you don't want to ruin the romance
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:55.440]   by, you know, talking numbers and figures all the time, but to my failure point,
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:10:00.120]   why don't we talk more about goals and aspirations and desires for the future?
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.120]   And with that, then comes the money.
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:04.800]   So for example, a big one, do we want to have kids?
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.240]   Is this something you were interested in?
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:09.920]   Because obviously there's a financial ramification to that, but there's also
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.480]   just sort of a life partner goal with that.
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:13.440]   That's a big one.
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:18.040]   And if we have trouble having kids, would you be open to
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:20.480]   something like IVF or adoption?
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:24.960]   These are important topics because if that comes up later on in your
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:28.720]   relationship and you didn't have some sort of pre-conversation about it,
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.520]   that can be a really tough point.
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:34.280]   How about little things like, Hey, what do you make as a salary?
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:35.960]   What, what kind of debt do you have?
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:39.080]   Like sort of opening up, you know, taking, taking the blinds down and
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.400]   saying, Hey, here's who I am.
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:41.600]   Here's what you're marrying.
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:45.520]   Here's what you're going into this relationship because what's mine is
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:49.000]   going to be yours, even the debt stuff, you know, so having some of those
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.560]   conversations beforehand can kind of help you to understand what you're getting into.
[00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:55.120]   So there's not a lot of surprise.
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:11:00.440]   I wish that I was a little bit more open and honest with my wife as I came into,
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.880]   you know, our relationship and talking about some of these bigger things.
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:06.400]   We did have some important conversations through some premarital counseling, but
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:11.040]   it was less on the financial side and, and more just sort of on the, you know,
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:13.640]   religious and life partner kind of side.
[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:17.200]   So I wish we would have opened up a little bit more with regard to our finances.
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:20.720]   But those are some of the questions that help a lot of couples out there.
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:23.480]   And that, that I've heard about when I've talked about on the show as well.
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:27.560]   It's amazing how everyone seems to know that we don't talk a lot
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:30.360]   about money in our society, but even in relationships, right.
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.800]   It's, it takes so long before it comes up.
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:33.160]   Yeah.
[00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:36.160]   If someone's listening to this and, and they've already kind of handled like
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.760]   chapter one, those questions you just mentioned, they're married, you know,
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:41.680]   they know how much their spouse makes and they know how much they've saved.
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:44.800]   Are there other big questions that you think come up down the road that
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:47.200]   are opportunities to address earlier?
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:47.960]   Yeah.
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:51.560]   You know, I would say a lot of it, a lot of the things that I think would be
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:55.680]   helpful for couples too, is regarding your career or your aspirations, things like that.
[00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:57.440]   Are you in a career?
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:01.520]   Are you on a path towards being a business owner that you enjoy?
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:04.080]   Or where do you see yourself going later on?
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:09.760]   Because maybe those expectations of what you as the, the partner are going to get
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:14.400]   into because you're married to this person, you need to know what you're going to get into.
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:17.600]   So having those relationship conversations and getting an understanding of those
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:20.920]   goals and aspirations beforehand really help you to know where you're going to be
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:24.920]   going as a couple, because those can be difficult, you know, if you're saying,
[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:28.880]   Hey, I'm already working at a job that I really dislike, and I'm interested
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:30.800]   in becoming a full-time photographer.
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:31.160]   Okay.
[00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:35.480]   That's an important thing to talk about because as you move forward, those are
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.240]   going to be some big transition points.
[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:41.240]   Maybe there'll be a point where you're fully funding the relationship and taking
[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:45.160]   care of the healthcare and the income while that person's making a transition
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:48.640]   into entrepreneurship, that's going to be a point that's going to require a lot
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:51.440]   of, you know, partnership and communication.
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:56.920]   So having some understanding around those career aspirations, those goals, and getting
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:59.320]   an understanding about that beforehand can definitely help.
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:00.680]   Yeah.
[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:04.000]   I hate to treat a relationship like business, but one of the things that I
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.840]   found was very interesting as a conversation was, you know, if this thing
[00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:13.000]   goes well financially, meaning if we end up making a lot more money than we think
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.760]   we will, what do we want to do with that?
[00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:16.280]   How would that change our lives?
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:20.960]   And the other side of it, if we end up not doing well financially, if we have
[00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:23.560]   problems, are we willing to cut housing?
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:25.320]   Are we willing to work more hours?
[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:26.880]   What kind of life do we want to live?
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:32.200]   And I think the closer you can get to being aligned on not necessarily wanting
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:35.800]   to do the same things, but understanding each person and their motivations, I
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:36.920]   think it can really, really help.
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:41.920]   Yeah, and I think making space and time for those conversations is important
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:46.640]   because as you get married, as you know, Chris, when you get married and then you
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:51.040]   have kids and you've got the job, you've got everything, your time together, your
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:53.360]   time to communicate becomes smaller.
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:58.960]   So putting marriage first and making that a priority to always
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.560]   set aside time to connect.
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:03.560]   This is our time to talk about the important things because when that goes
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:06.840]   away, that's when the big fights start happening because people don't feel like
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:08.000]   they are being heard.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.120]   They don't feel like their buckets are being filled and they take it out on the
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:16.360]   other spouse and that's definitely happened in our relationship for sure.
[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:22.160]   It seems like with every business, you get to a certain size and
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.960]   the cracks start to emerge.
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:28.080]   Things that you used to do in a day are taking a week and you have too many
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:31.040]   manual processes and there's no one source of truth.
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:37.240]   If this is you, you should know these three numbers, 37,000, 25, 1.
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:38.640]   37,000.
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:42.440]   That's the number of businesses which have upgraded to NetSuite by Oracle and
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:44.520]   I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:48.640]   NetSuite is the number one cloud financial system, streamlining accounting,
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:51.360]   financial management, inventory, HR, and more.
[00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:52.600]   25.
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.760]   NetSuite turns 25 this year.
[00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:59.600]   That's 25 years of helping businesses do more with less, close their books in
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:02.320]   days, not weeks, and drive down costs.
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:07.720]   And one, because your business is one of a kind, so you get a customized solution
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:12.360]   for all your KPIs in one efficient system with one source of truth.
[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:16.280]   Manage risk, get reliable forecasts, and improve margins.
[00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:20.640]   Everything you need to grow all in one place, which I can tell you from all the
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:23.440]   companies I've run, makes everything so much better.

[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:50.800]   There is nothing I love more than learning that something I enjoy is
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:55.080]   actually so good for you, and nothing showcases that better than Pu-erh tea.
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:58.960]   It has so many health benefits, and I think one of the best and easiest ways
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:01.960]   to consume it is from our sponsor today, Peak Tea.
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:07.040]   Peak's Pu-erh teas are all cold extracted using only wild harvested leaves from
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:12.480]   250-year-old tea trees, rich in minerals, theraflavins, and catechins.
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:17.720]   Then everything is triple toxin screened for pesticides, heavy minerals, and toxic
[00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:19.600]   mold commonly found in plants.
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:24.080]   And Peak's products are so easy and zero prep, because they're all in
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:28.320]   pre-measured quantities that dissolve in cold or hot water in seconds,
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:30.080]   and are so travel friendly.
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:34.320]   They have so many products, but lately I've been alternating between the green
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:39.040]   Pu-erh for mental clarity and energy, and the black Pu-erh, which helps kickstart
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:43.800]   digestion and metabolism with a rich, earthy flavor that is so good, and
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:45.800]   probably one of my favorite things to drink.
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:49.440]   And if you need another reason, search for all the amazing research-backed
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:53.720]   benefits of polyphenols for your gut microbiome, heart, blood sugar, and more,
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:57.160]   and then be happy that Pu-erh is more concentrated in polyphenols
[00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:59.000]   than all other teas in the world.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.560]   But you don't even have to take my word, or do any research, because Peak
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:06.360]   offers free US shipping, free returns, and a money-backed guarantee.
[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:11.960]   And for a limited time, you can get up to 15% off and a free quiver with 12
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:18.240]   tea samples at my link at allthehacks.com/peak, that's P-I-Q-U-E.
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:23.800]   So check them out today at allthehacks.com/peak, P-I-Q-U-E.
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:29.720]   I got a lot of satisfaction out of trying to categorize all of our spending to
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:31.720]   understand how much we're spending.
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:36.240]   And for me, it was about figuring out what we're saving and understanding the
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:37.680]   impact that'll have on our future.
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:42.360]   For my wife, it was a monotonous task of going through Mint and recategorizing
[00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:45.320]   their terrible descriptions, you know, saying, "No, this thing at a gas
[00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:48.600]   station was actually a vacation," and that didn't go well.
[00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:53.000]   But as we talked about why we were doing it, what the purpose was, that helped.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.160]   Now we have a child and time is less, you know, abundant.
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:03.280]   Are there times of the week, month, year that you think are good to have these
[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:03.960]   conversations?
[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:05.760]   Are there ways to make them more fun?
[00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:09.040]   I feel like it almost never is the right time to talk about money.
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:09.920]   Yeah, I hear you.
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:12.840]   Yeah, in the beginning of our relationship, we set up something.
[00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:14.480]   And when I say "we," it was me, just like you.
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:18.360]   I was grabbing the mint and being the money nerd, saying, "Hey, let's have a
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:19.320]   budget party.
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:21.560]   Let's sit down and review the budget."
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:24.480]   I threw the word "party" on it so it sounded like a little bit more fun, and
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:25.360]   maybe she'd show up.
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:28.960]   I brought some, like, wine and pizza, and that kind of helped a little bit.
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:30.360]   Just put a little marketing spin on it.
[00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:32.880]   And it worked because she showed up.
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:36.080]   But as time rolled on, our lives changed.
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:39.200]   We had to get a little bit more inventive with this thing in order to keep that
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:39.800]   connection.
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:43.960]   So when we had little kids, it was like, "Okay, well, we need to connect.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.080]   It's important to do that.
[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:48.960]   Let's do that after they go to bed so we have some time to speak."
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:52.480]   And then as the kids got a little older, we said, "Okay, well, they're clawing
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:53.040]   at our legs.
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:55.000]   Why don't we take this to, like, a play place?"
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.520]   So we would go to, like, a place where the kids could run around, go down the
[00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:02.200]   slides, and jump down while we were planning our lives and having time
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:03.400]   together or drinking a coffee.
[00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:08.000]   And we even took our budget party to, like, a restaurant one time where we
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   said, "Hey, let's have dinner while we go over the numbers and have the receipts
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   on the table," and everybody looked at us kind of funny.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.120]   But we were planning our lives, and we were figuring things out together, and
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:17.600]   we didn't care.
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:23.320]   So it's just kind of being inventive and making it a good time because, yeah,
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:25.320]   when you talk about it like that, just saying, "Hey, let's stare at a
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:29.600]   spreadsheet and talk about numbers," my wife just, you know, glazes over and is
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:31.360]   like, "Dude, can we do anything else?"
[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:37.320]   But if you add some fun into it and also maybe don't just always talk about the
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:37.640]   numbers.
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:39.880]   We're talking about, "Hey, what's going on this month?
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:42.320]   What activities do we have going on with the kids?
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:43.960]   Is there a wedding coming up?
[00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:45.760]   Is there birthday parties that are coming up?
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:49.520]   What do we have going on this month that's going to be, you know, taking over
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:51.400]   or that we need to schedule out?"
[00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:56.040]   And then, and the back end of it, "How are we pursuing those goals, those things
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:20:00.160]   that we've always talked about being excited about, whether it's a vacation or
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:03.520]   hitting some financial goals like, you know, paying off debt or anything like
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:03.800]   that?
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:08.400]   How are we doing on those goals that help us to give us more freedom and more fun
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:08.760]   today?"
[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:13.680]   So having a little fun with it, you know, and getting inventive has helped us a
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:13.920]   lot.
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:19.720]   I think having that list of shared and independent goals is really, really
[00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:20.200]   valuable.
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:24.120]   I know there are things I wanted to do, like start this podcast that was going to
[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:27.640]   take up extra time and for a while take up extra cost.
[00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:29.880]   And then there are things we wanted to do like vacations.
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:34.640]   And so I think starting off conversations, getting aligned on where you want to go,
[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:37.480]   why you want to go there and understanding it is really valuable.
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:38.120]   Absolutely.
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:42.680]   I think one of the things that I find as a frustration, or I guess maybe more
[00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:47.440]   well put, my wife finds as a frustration, is I treat things very logically, right?
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:52.520]   I'm like, "Well, of course it makes sense to do this thing because the rate of
[00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:54.160]   return on this thing is better.
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:56.520]   And so we should of course do this."
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:00.800]   And so that taken to its extreme can be a frustrating conversation.
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:06.160]   One thing that I know you've talked a lot about is how you guys got a mortgage and
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:08.120]   paid it off in about five years.
[00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:12.560]   And I know a lot of people give the financial advice and I've probably given
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:15.640]   it to people as well, which is, "Well, the market return over the long run is
[00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:16.760]   better than mortgage rates."
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:20.360]   So I don't know how I could possibly make that decision.
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:24.400]   For you, it wasn't about just always being financially logical and doing the
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:25.800]   economic best choice.
[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:29.000]   How did you guys talk about making that decision?
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.800]   And then ultimately also, how did you do it?
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:32.080]   Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:34.480]   So in the beginning, it was one of those things.
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:41.080]   I had bought a house the first time around in 2004, and I feel like I did it
[00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:41.720]   the wrong way.
[00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:47.040]   I put too little down and got into a situation where I didn't really
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:52.440]   understand that there were costs outside of the mortgage, like bills and fixing
[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:56.600]   the place and closing costs, all sorts of stuff that I didn't even plan on.
[00:21:56.600 --> 00:22:01.840]   Over time, I ended up taking a pay cut at my job in order to move to a different
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:04.720]   position because the first position was a little too stressful for me.
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:08.960]   I looked at maybe this house and the costs that are associated with it,
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:10.840]   taking up about 50% of my income.
[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:14.320]   I just felt like owned by the house instead of owning the house.
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:16.160]   And so I hated that.
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:17.040]   I hated that position.
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:20.760]   I ended up getting roommates to help me pay the mortgage eventually, which was an
[00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:23.680]   old version of house hacking, I guess, to help me out there.
[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:29.360]   But even with that, the Great Recession came to Metro Detroit and hit us really
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:33.000]   hard, so there was a point in time, I think it was around 2008, 2009, that my
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.760]   $200,000 house that I bought was now valued at $100,000.
[00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:42.280]   So not only was the cost of it just consuming me, but the asset that I
[00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:44.000]   purchased was just a dud.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.120]   And I just felt like, "Man, is this really how it's supposed to go?"
[00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:53.320]   Eventually sold the house about 10 years later for pretty much break even.
[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:57.200]   So when my wife was like, "Hey, let's get a bigger house and a nicer
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:02.720]   neighborhood, better schools," I'm like, "I am down, but I do not want to have a
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:03.200]   mortgage.
[00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:07.760]   I do not want to have something that I feel like is on my back, that I'm going to
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:08.880]   have to keep paying for it.
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:12.840]   I'm going to have to keep working at this job that I don't really like that much in
[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:15.640]   order to pay a mortgage that I'm not really that excited about."
[00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:20.280]   And so I said, "Hey, we'll get the house, but let's keep aggressively saving and
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:21.800]   we'll pay it off in five years."
[00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:23.040]   And she said, "Cool, that's fine.
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:23.600]   Let's do that."
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:29.080]   So what we did is essentially just lived on half and kept on making massive
[00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:31.160]   principal payments each month.
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:37.120]   Anytime we got new money that came in, whether it was a tax refund or a bonus or
[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:42.680]   selling stuff on Facebook Marketplace or Craigslist, we would throw it at the
[00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:43.120]   principal.
[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:47.800]   And a little bit less than four years later, we were mortgage-free.
[00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:53.200]   And with that freedom, we were able to make some changes in our lives.
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:54.960]   We were able to travel a bit more.
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:59.080]   We were able to make some career choice changes that I eventually made.
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:04.680]   And that initial conversation with Nicole, to your point, it wasn't easy, but I
[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:05.480]   think she got it.
[00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:06.640]   She understood.
[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:09.360]   I mean, she understood my motivation around home ownership.
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:15.680]   She understood my interest in not having a payment that would be hanging over my
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:17.040]   head for so long.
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:19.360]   And to your point on investing, we did both.
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:21.560]   We invested and we paid off the mortgage.
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:27.200]   We maxed out our retirement during the time we were paying off our mortgage.
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:28.560]   And so we did both.
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:31.560]   And I understand sometimes it's a either/or kind of thing.
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:34.880]   We saw this as an and opportunity, invest and pay off the mortgage.
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:39.040]   And now we're in a position where we have enough in our retirement funds that we
[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:42.080]   feel like we can let that coast as well as having a paid off house.
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:43.240]   So life's good right now.
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:44.680]   Yeah.
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:49.320]   So it sounds like that was a great outcome and you guys got on the same page easily.
[00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:52.200]   I know you've talked in the past about things that you haven't necessarily gotten
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:53.000]   on the same page.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.760]   Are there things that either you or people you talk to are common sources of
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:01.760]   frustration or arguments about money and ideas on how to tackle them?
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:02.200]   Yeah.
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:05.280]   I mean, I can tell you one that finishes that story.
[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:11.240]   It's right around the time we paid off the mortgage, I got really excited about
[00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:15.840]   something else called financial independence and forgot to tell my wife about it.
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:22.000]   So when we paid off the house, I said, OK, now new goal, we're going to buy rental
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.200]   properties and we're going to keep saving half of our income.
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:28.680]   And that way we can keep buying rental properties until I'm able to kind of
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:32.280]   leave my nine to five and just own rental properties.
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:32.840]   And that's what we're going to do.
[00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:34.120]   It's our financial independence plan.
[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:38.320]   And she said, well, we've been saving so much for so long.
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:43.440]   Can we enjoy life a little bit and, you know, vacation and travel?
[00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:46.000]   And maybe I can upgrade this house that we've been living for a while.
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:52.120]   And I was so frustrated with my career at that point in life that and the fact that
[00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:54.320]   we had such little kids and I sort of lost it, man.
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:56.240]   I lost it in a bad way.
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:26:01.480]   I lost it and was very frustrated that my wife and I weren't seeing eye to eye on
[00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:03.000]   this this idea.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.600]   And we had a really big glow up.
[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:08.640]   We had a really big volcano type fight that she describes it as.
[00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:13.960]   It was one of those things where we just were not seeing eye to eye on what to do
[00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:14.640]   with this money.
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:16.600]   We were in a very well off way.
[00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:19.640]   And, you know, obviously people can fight when they don't have enough money and then
[00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:21.400]   people can fight when they have enough money.
[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:24.640]   And we were fighting when we had a blessing of money coming in.
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:27.440]   We just did not agree on what to do with it.
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:31.520]   So what we ended up doing is going to marriage counseling.
[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:37.240]   And it was one of those things that at the point I was like, man, I feel like I am
[00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:38.120]   failing this marriage.
[00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:40.960]   I feel like going to marriage counseling means that you are failing.
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:46.920]   And. Unfortunately, I was wrong, or fortunately, I was wrong, for that matter, I
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:52.400]   went to my first session with with Nicole and found out that this wasn't something to
[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:53.400]   be sad about.
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:58.720]   It was something that was providing us some coaching on actually how to speak better to
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:01.080]   each other, how to communicate better as a couple.
[00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:03.640]   We likened it to almost like a physical trainer.
[00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:07.920]   You know, if you want to you want to get stronger, you want to be healthier, you can
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:11.560]   outsource that to somebody who's a great third party coach that can show you how.
[00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:13.000]   And that's what our counselor did for us.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.240]   They helped us to communicate better.
[00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:20.840]   And one thing that our counselor did for me was to allow me to empathize with my wife's
[00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:21.840]   situation a bit more.
[00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:28.080]   Hey, man, she was staying home as a stay at home mom and was taking care of two little
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:33.720]   kids for a really long time and wanted a little bit more joy and fun in her life.
[00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:40.320]   And her husband now wants to use all that extra money for more hard charging savings.
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:44.040]   And for her, that was just like, hey, come on, let's let our feet off the gas and have a
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:48.560]   little bit more fun and learning a little bit more during counseling about how she grew
[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:52.040]   up. You know, she grew up with a single mom and an apartment.
[00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:58.440]   And for her, success meant a nice home and fun and excitement and vacations.
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:00.520]   And now that we have the money, we can't even do that.
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:06.240]   So we found some middle ground through our counseling sessions and through some
[00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:11.840]   conversations for us to both kind of realize some of our dreams and goals.
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:14.800]   And again, sometimes that takes a third party to get there.
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:15.640]   And for us, it did.
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:22.120]   Any other interesting lessons or tactics that you learned through that process that were
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:23.720]   helpful? Yeah, absolutely.
[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:28.800]   I would say that one thing that we like to do during that time frame was let our kids
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:33.680]   know what was going on, because marriage isn't always easy.
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:36.240]   There are ups, there are downs.
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:43.280]   And letting our kids know that we were working hard to have a good relationship.
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:46.000]   And sometimes that means that you need some help.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.400]   And so every time we went to our sessions, we would let our kids know.
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:52.680]   We would say, hey, mommy and daddy are working on our relationship.
[00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:56.160]   We're working on being able to communicate better with each other.
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:29:00.040]   And we are putting in the work and we want you to know that.
[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:02.000]   And so we wanted our kids to see that.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.560]   We wanted them to know that marriage takes work.
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:09.080]   And just like any relationships that they have or will have in the future, if you care
[00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:12.080]   about it enough, you really have to put in the effort.
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:15.000]   So that was one thing that we definitely let our kids know about.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.400]   Yeah, that's fascinating.
[00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:19.400]   My daughter's just turned one.
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:24.520]   So I'm in that struggle that I can't really communicate with her in the way I want to.
[00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:26.240]   But I'm really excited to do that.
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:30.280]   And I definitely in a few minutes want to jump into some of the things you're doing
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:31.280]   with your kids and money.
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:36.760]   But before that, something I often hear people talk about is the topic of combining finances.
[00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:40.600]   And it's something that I think can go in a lot of directions and people can do it
[00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:44.840]   different ways. Are you of the school of thought that there's a best way?
[00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:49.760]   Or how should couples whose finances maybe aren't combined and are thinking about it,
[00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:50.520]   think about it?
[00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:55.200]   Yeah, I definitely think this is an individual choice in your relationship.
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:57.120]   I don't think there's one right way.
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:00.600]   That being said, Nicole and I chose to combine our finances at the beginning of our
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:03.680]   relationship. We've looked back on it and being like, why did we do that?
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:06.480]   You know, I think it was just sort of like, that's how our parents did it or that's how
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:07.720]   we understood it to be.
[00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:09.720]   But yeah, there's multiple ways you can slice it.
[00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:15.040]   You can do completely combined like Nicole and I do, or you can do something like yours,
[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:15.960]   mine and ours.
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:20.320]   So you've got maybe their funds that they like to spend on, yours that you like to spend
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:23.600]   on. And then there's a collection of, hey, here are the things we'd like to spend on as
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:25.760]   a family. And then there's completely separate.
[00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:29.800]   And all of these work for different relationships in different ways.
[00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:34.040]   We found in through conversations with other people that when you add kids into the mix,
[00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:36.320]   that's when things can get a little bit more difficult.
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:39.520]   Right. If you're completely separate, then, you know, where do diapers go?
[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:43.760]   Who pays for those? You know, is that part of yours or mine or ours or daycare?
[00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:44.840]   Like, where does that go?
[00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:50.720]   So I like joint because I feel like it means like we are on a mission together.
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:53.560]   We're working on common goals.
[00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:55.120]   We're working as a team.
[00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:57.920]   But what we do is sort of like a little little compromise.
[00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:02.640]   It's not yours, mine and ours, but we do joint with individual budget line items because
[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:05.000]   there are certain things that she really wants to have.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.200]   Like she needs her haircuts.
[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:08.840]   She needs her clothes. She needs her home decor.
[00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:13.000]   And these are all things that we have in our mint budget that are line itemed out.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.400]   And she gets them no matter what.
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:16.440]   Oh, definitely one is the cleaning lady.
[00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:19.720]   I think I tried to I tried to frugal my way out of that.
[00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:20.680]   That did not go well.
[00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:25.840]   That was that was a that was a highly valued line item that that did not go well when I
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:28.840]   brought that up as something that maybe we should consider not having.
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:29.800]   But I've got the same thing.
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:33.760]   I've got some line items for my stuff, you know, like guys night out and other things like that.
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:36.960]   So I think, you know, it's all particular.
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:40.600]   It's all particular to the couple, I would say, maybe for second marriages.
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:44.680]   Maybe there is a little bit more hesitancy in combining everything together.
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:46.800]   And yeah, it all depends on your relationship.
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:50.280]   So I don't think there's one right way, but joint has worked for us.
[00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:57.840]   Yeah, a hybrid of joint that we do, and this really stemmed from I was in a job where I
[00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:02.320]   had a lot of expenses for work, I was taking trips, or if I was in a city, I might throw
[00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:04.480]   an event and put the event on my card.
[00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:12.320]   And so it became pretty stressful for my wife to see a credit card bill be like, "Hey, why
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:13.680]   did you spend $20,000?"
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:14.440]   I'm like, "No, no, no.
[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:19.680]   Actually, it's like $18,000 of work expenses and $2,000 of non-work."
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:21.480]   But to her, she's like, "Well, I don't know.
[00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:22.160]   This is a bar.
[00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:22.840]   This is a flight.
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:23.560]   This is a hotel."
[00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:28.320]   And so we actually had a separate account and a separate credit card that I used for
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:30.760]   work stuff so that I could say, "Look, I'm going to put all this here."
[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:35.840]   So it wasn't 100% joint because some things were work, but it was like reimbursable work
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:40.880]   versus if you have a business, I would highly recommend keeping that separate for both
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:42.880]   business tax reasons and other things.
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:46.480]   But sometimes if you're spending a lot of money for work and you don't have a corporate
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:50.160]   credit card, it can make sense to keep things separate just so people have an
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:51.640]   understanding of where things are going.
[00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:57.480]   And it's hard sometimes to monitor and get a sense of how much you're saving when the
[00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:01.480]   amount of money coming in and out is variable because of work expenses.
[00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:03.960]   So that was one thing that happened.
[00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:04.840]   And then gifts.
[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:08.840]   So we still have our own separate credit cards that get paid out of a joint account just
[00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:11.960]   because I think we're the kinds of people that would see it and be like, "Oh, what's
[00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:12.240]   this?"
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:13.480]   Like, it just doesn't matter.
[00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:18.360]   There's small enough expenses that I think for us, it's better to just keep on our own.
[00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:23.000]   And then we created a kind of rule that we've evolved over time of if something's
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.080]   going to cost over X, and I think at one point in our relationship, it was $200.
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:29.960]   And I think now we're like, "Maybe we should upgrade it to $500."
[00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:32.760]   It's like, if it costs over that, let's talk about it.
[00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:36.200]   Otherwise, we trust each other and we don't have to say, "Should we do this?
[00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:37.800]   Can I go out to dinner with my friends?"
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:38.840]   And that kind of stuff.
[00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:39.960]   So that's what's worked for us.
[00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:44.440]   So joint checking, but separate credit cards and kind of a rule about spending.
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:45.240]   I like that a lot.
[00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:45.400]   Yeah.
[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:47.320]   And I have a small business now.
[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:52.040]   And so sometimes I'm able to lump some of the family expenses that used to be in our
[00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:53.400]   budget over there.
[00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:58.280]   You know, for example, we have family photos that I ended up putting on my website and
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:00.840]   things like that, but they end up being great family photos for the family.
[00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:04.280]   So these are things that I can now put on my business expenses.
[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:07.480]   But to your point, I get to go to conferences.
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:10.200]   I get to buy dinners and things like that.
[00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:11.480]   And that can all be a business expense.
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:15.960]   So that could be sensitive if she doesn't have money for that type of stuff too.
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:18.600]   So just having open conversation about it has helped us.
[00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:20.920]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:22.520]   That's all money in marriage.
[00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:26.040]   But I know that, you know, you've talked a lot about things about marriage that aren't
[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:28.440]   money-related and, you know, the show, "All the Hacks."
[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:33.320]   Are there relationship, marriage kind of tricks, hacks, things that you've used to have a
[00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:37.240]   successful relationship or enjoy more time together?
[00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:37.480]   Yeah.
[00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:42.120]   You know, one thing that I have used in my relationship and I talk to a lot of other
[00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:46.200]   couples too, is just knowing my spouse's love language.
[00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:48.680]   You know, this comes from that book, "The Five Love Languages."
[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:52.600]   And for Nicole, her language is time spent, for sure.
[00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:53.880]   And acts of service.
[00:34:53.880 --> 00:35:00.040]   So over the past few years, I, after, you know, consuming that book and understanding
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:05.720]   a little bit more about my wife's languages, I've started to create some habits for myself
[00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:11.800]   that allow for more time spent with her and more acts of service on the daily.
[00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:14.680]   So a couple of years ago, I'm like, "Okay, well, she loves coffee.
[00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:17.080]   What if I just bring her coffee in bed every day?"
[00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:21.080]   Because I always get up before her and she would probably really appreciate that.
[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:26.840]   So over the past, I think, year and a half now, I bring her coffee in bed every day.
[00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:33.160]   And so I would say I'd give myself maybe like a B plus, A minus with this over the last
[00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:33.800]   year.
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:38.200]   Maybe 300 out of the 365 days I've done this and she loves it.
[00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:41.080]   It's just one of those things where I understand who she is.
[00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:47.640]   I understand her styles for love and it just sort of helps her to start her morning off
[00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:48.680]   on the right foot.
[00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:52.760]   So just kind of understanding a little bit about who your spouse is, how they like to
[00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:55.000]   be loved can go a long way.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.800]   Because for a long while, I really like words of affirmation.
[00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:01.000]   When somebody says, "I'm doing a great job," or "She loves me," or whatever, that makes
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:01.800]   me feel great.
[00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:03.800]   So for a while, I would just project that on her.
[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:06.680]   I'd be like, "Well, I'm going to write her a note and tell her how great she is," or
[00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:09.000]   "I'm going to verbally tell her."
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   And for a while, it would just sort of like, it wouldn't connect.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.760]   And I'd be like, "Well, what's wrong with her?
[00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:17.960]   I've given her all the love, but she doesn't feel it."
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:22.760]   But I was just sort of loving her in the wrong way until I learned that, "Hey, she really
[00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:26.520]   likes just time with you, man," or "She really likes when you help around the house or do
[00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:28.120]   nice things for her."
[00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:31.480]   So that took some trial and error on my part, but I'm still learning every day.
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:31.980]   So...
[00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:33.800]   Yeah.
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:37.320]   If I'm sick, I'm the kind of person that would love someone to take care of me.
[00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:39.400]   Come over and bring me a tea.
[00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:42.200]   And my wife's like, "When I'm sick, I want to be left alone."
[00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:45.160]   And so we had this whole challenge where I was like, "I want this."
[00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:46.600]   And she's like, "No, you don't need that."
[00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:50.440]   And then we kind of realized, "Oh, you want something different from me, and I can give
[00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:52.200]   it to you even though I don't want it."
[00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:54.920]   She's like, "But you also have to respect that I don't want it."
[00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:55.800]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:58.200]   In some cases, it can actually be too much.
[00:36:58.200 --> 00:36:58.680]   Absolutely.
[00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:06.040]   So I actually have a running note on my phone that's just like subtle reminders.
[00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:10.680]   And anytime I notice something in our relationship, I just kind of write it down to make sure I'm
[00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:13.480]   like, "Hey, you know, Amy doesn't love this thing."
[00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:15.800]   Or, "This is an opportunity to improve."
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:17.240]   Or, "She really likes this."
[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:22.360]   And one thing that I think has really helped in our relationship for me is, as I keep these
[00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:25.720]   notes, every now and then, I just kind of take a look at them.
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:29.080]   And I'm like, "Oh, you know, this thing, she really liked this thing.
[00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:32.120]   Let's pick that thing up after work and bring it home."
[00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:36.840]   Or, "Let's just take a pause and just tell her about a few things this week that she's
[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:37.880]   done that I really appreciate."
[00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:41.880]   And these things are so easy for us to forget to do.
[00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:43.880]   And they're so easy.
[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:48.760]   Like the act of pausing and just telling someone something meaningful they did or how they
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:52.600]   made you feel, it's such an easy thing that it's not fake.
[00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:53.240]   It's actually true.
[00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:54.360]   You actually feel it.
[00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:57.000]   Sometimes life gets so busy that you don't get to share it.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:02.920]   So, I try to keep a log of things that I appreciate her, just little things that she might like,
[00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:05.000]   and check it regularly.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.720]   I don't actually have a calendar event, but I probably should.
[00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:11.000]   So, I think it would add even more value if I did it more consistently.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:11.880]   I think that's great.
[00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:12.840]   I've got a similar list.
[00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:13.960]   It's called Nicole's Happy List.
[00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:15.560]   It's right on my phone, the little notes app.
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:18.440]   And just kind of look at it every once in a while, add things onto it.
[00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:22.440]   But yeah, to your point, if you could just like how we talk about hacking or habit stacking,
[00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:28.600]   it's like, what can I do to make this a recurring thing that I do every day?
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:32.600]   Even if it's just 5, 10 minutes of an action that can go miles.
[00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:38.760]   One other thing that we didn't talk about, but you've talked about how it's kind of an
[00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:39.720]   impressive journey, right?
[00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:44.040]   You started at debt, paid it off in a year in advance of your child coming.
[00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:45.560]   Then you paid off a mortgage.
[00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:50.520]   And then in less than 10 years, you took that negative debt net worth all the way to a million
[00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:51.020]   dollars.
[00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:54.440]   What along that journey made that possible?
[00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:59.080]   Were you both on board with that kind of a goal and how did you get there so quickly?
[00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:03.080]   Yeah, it was a good story and a good successful journey.
[00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:06.760]   Honestly, obviously, a lot of it has to do with how much somebody can make.
[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:11.640]   Because this story for somebody making $50,000 a year would be a lot more difficult.
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:15.240]   We, on average, during that 10 years, we were making $190,000.
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:20.920]   And that's two working professionals in the Metro Detroit area.
[00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:25.800]   And we worked hard and got progressive raises and things like that to help.
[00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:32.840]   But a lot of it was just sort of growing that gap between what we spend and what we save.
[00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:38.520]   And having that gap helped us to consistently do some great things.
[00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:41.720]   In the beginning, it was using that gap to pay off our debt.
[00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:48.360]   And then it was, "Hey, let's max out our retirement accounts so that we have a great
[00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:52.440]   investment balance as we grow into the years that we actually need this money."
[00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:55.640]   And then again, with that gap, we paid off our mortgage.
[00:39:55.640 --> 00:40:01.720]   And a lot of the things that are in our net worth right now are a half a million dollar
[00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:04.600]   home and about a half a million dollars of investments.
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:08.680]   And then obviously, cash and cars and things like that kind of round everything out.
[00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:09.960]   But that's really it.
[00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:14.440]   I mean, investing early and then paying off our home is what it is.
[00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:18.760]   So you think millionaire and it sounds flashy with cars and watches and all that stuff.
[00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:20.200]   It's like, it's boring stuff, man.
[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:27.640]   It's like a big old traditional IRA and a Roth IRA, HSA accounts, things like that,
[00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:29.080]   and for home and some cash.
[00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:30.360]   And that's pretty much it.
[00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:36.200]   But a lot of it was from us just allowing ourselves to not inflate our lifestyle as
[00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:37.480]   we continue to grow our income.
[00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:40.120]   In the beginning, I was making $30,000 a year.
[00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:44.280]   And by the end of my career, I was making closer to $200,000 a year.
[00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:47.880]   But we consistently lived on half during that time period.
[00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:50.600]   And we were able to enjoy life.
[00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:54.280]   I mean, obviously, even half of a lot of money is still a lot of money.
[00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:59.960]   So we vacationed, had fun, but we were able to do some incredible things that really helped
[00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:02.040]   our family create some freedom for ourselves.
[00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:02.600]   It's been great.
[00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:10.120]   Any unusual things that you guys did to kind of grow that gap that, obviously, cutting
[00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:15.320]   things out of a budget or just being more frugal are regular things.
[00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:17.320]   But are there anything unusual in there?
[00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:19.320]   Honestly, none of it was too irregular.
[00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:24.120]   Just consistently investing during the period, having some automation with our investing.
[00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:26.920]   So it just happens without us even thinking about it.
[00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:32.280]   And over time, you look back and you say, "Wow, this balance is built up to an incredible
[00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:36.040]   amount by me just physically not doing anything, not touching it."
[00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:40.280]   I feel like success with investing is less about what you do and more about what you
[00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:41.000]   don't do.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:46.360]   It's just like, if I didn't touch this thing and see the balance grow as it has, that's
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:51.000]   really where we've found most of our success, just investing in low-cost index funds and
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:51.960]   letting it ride.
[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:55.880]   And we've had a very nice bull market over the past, whatever, eight to nine years that
[00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:56.920]   has helped us out quite a bit.
[00:41:56.920 --> 00:42:00.760]   But it's one of those things we're just going to stay on the roller coaster and see where
[00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:01.640]   it goes no matter what.
[00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:03.960]   So yeah, I love that.
[00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:11.080]   Sometimes the smallest changes make the biggest impact and Trade Coffee is a great addition
[00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:12.680]   to your new year routine.
[00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:15.080]   And I am so excited to be partnering with them today.
[00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:19.640]   Trade is a subscription service we've been using for over a year that sources the best
[00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:23.800]   coffee across the country and brings it straight to your doorstep.
[00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:28.520]   They've built relationships with over 50 local roasters so you can enjoy their craft from
[00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:33.240]   the comfort of your own home at a fraction of the cost of going out for coffee.
[00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:36.280]   There's multiple ways to experience coffee with Trade.
[00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:40.200]   Sign up for a subscription or try one of their starter packs today.
[00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:44.680]   It's been so convenient for us to have coffee just show up exactly when we need it.
[00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:48.600]   And over the past year, we've gotten so many great coffees from Trade.
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:54.040]   But this last bag of beans from Drink Coffee, Do Stuff in Tahoe, it's called Bark the Moon
[00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:55.320]   and it's so delicious.
[00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:59.080]   So jumpstart this year by signing up for a Trade subscription.
[00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:03.800]   Right now, Trade is offering a free bag with select subscription plans when you visit
[00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:06.760]   allthehacks.com/trade.
[00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:12.200]   That's allthehacks.com/trade for a free bag with select subscription plans.
[00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:14.520]   allthehacks.com/trade.
[00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:21.800]   Do you all remember episode 122 when I spoke to Chef David Chang about leveling up your
[00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:23.000]   cooking at home?
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.320]   If not, definitely go back and give it a listen.
[00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:28.760]   But one of his top hacks was using the microwave more.
[00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:33.800]   I'll admit, I was a skeptic at first, but after getting a full set of microwave cookware
[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:38.440]   from Anyday, I'm a total convert and I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:43.480]   Anyday is glass cookware specifically designed to make delicious food from scratch in the
[00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:44.360]   microwave.
[00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:49.480]   And honestly, using it feels like a kitchen cheat code because it speeds up and simplifies
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:51.160]   the process so much.
[00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:56.840]   The cookware is 100% plastic free and you can cook, serve, store, and reheat all in
[00:43:56.840 --> 00:44:01.400]   the same dish that happens to be dishwasher, freezer, and oven safe too.
[00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:06.120]   And if you need a recipe suggestion to kick off your Anyday adventure, I highly recommend
[00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:07.720]   David Chang's Salmon Rice.
[00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:09.000]   It is so good.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:14.600]   And if you haven't checked out the Matte Black IO Collection they launched last year, you
[00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:16.040]   have to check it out.
[00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:22.760]   So to get 15% off our new favorite cookware, go to allthehacks.com/anyday.

[00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:33.240]   I just want to thank you, Quick, for listening to and supporting the show.

[00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:49.880]   So we haven't talked about kids much, but you have two kids.
[00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:51.080]   I have one kid.
[00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:54.040]   I haven't even thought much about children and money.
[00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:58.600]   But you know, one of the stats that I think everyone kind of really rubs into your head
[00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:01.400]   is it costs about $200,000 to have a kid.
[00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:03.080]   It costs a million dollars to have a kid.
[00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:04.280]   I've seen everything.
[00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:06.360]   I've never seen anything that's lower than that.
[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:09.160]   No one ever says, "Oh, no, no, it's actually only a hundred dollars."
[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:10.200]   Yeah, right.
[00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:12.360]   So it's very clear that kids cost money.
[00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:13.880]   How do you feel about these numbers?
[00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:18.200]   As someone who's put a lot of time into saving, are they real?
[00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:20.040]   Are there ways to improve them?
[00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:21.080]   How do you think about it?
[00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:23.160]   Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't doubt that.
[00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:27.080]   I think I've seen the majority of the statistics I've seen is around $200,000, something like
[00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:28.600]   that, $200,000, $250,000.
[00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:29.240]   I believe it.
[00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:29.800]   I believe it.
[00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:30.840]   Yeah, they got to eat.
[00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:32.120]   They got to go to school.
[00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:33.720]   They have to have clothes.
[00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:37.480]   You know, it's all that important stuff that needs to happen from zero to 18 years.
[00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:39.400]   But then college isn't even included that.
[00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:45.880]   And I think our in-state public university, by the time our kids go, is going to be about
[00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:48.360]   $200,000 for four years as well.
[00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:50.520]   So that's $400,000 because I've got two kids.
[00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:51.960]   And that's a crazy cost.
[00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:55.080]   But I mean, would I do it any differently?
[00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:56.040]   No, I love them.
[00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:56.440]   I love them.
[00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:57.800]   They're worth every penny.
[00:45:57.800 --> 00:46:02.600]   And I mean, talk about coming to your point on mathematical decisions.
[00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:07.000]   If I was thinking about math all the time, then I definitely wouldn't have had children.
[00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:11.880]   But it is hard to make an economic decision.
[00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:12.680]   Exactly.
[00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:15.080]   And they are worth every penny.
[00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:15.560]   Absolutely.
[00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:16.520]   I love being with them.
[00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:19.080]   And I mean, the college thing is different.
[00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:22.280]   That's going to be kind of tough to swallow.
[00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:27.400]   And I'm not sure we're going to be able to get up to $400,000 of savings for them to
[00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:28.840]   experience college.
[00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:30.680]   But outside of that, no.
[00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:31.560]   Worth every penny.
[00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:33.000]   And yeah, we'd do it all over again.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.920]   Yeah.
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:37.480]   You've saved a lot, obviously, for yourselves.
[00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:42.840]   And I think one of the challenges that people who don't just have an abundance of unlimited
[00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:46.760]   money face is you've got your own life, and then you've got your kid's life.
[00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:50.520]   And in a perfect world, you could have all the money you need to do everything you want,
[00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:53.000]   give your children all the money they need to do anything they want.
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.520]   And that reality is just not true for most people.
[00:46:56.520 --> 00:47:03.320]   And so how do you balance saving for yourself versus saving for your kids or their education?
[00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:09.720]   And how do you think about whether you should deprive yourself from a few more vacations
[00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:15.080]   in order to leave them with enough money to pay for college and not have to take on debt?
[00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:15.720]   Yeah.
[00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:18.600]   Again, I think that's all personal for each family.
[00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:23.560]   But for us, what we like to do is make sure that we're all set for retirement before we
[00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:27.560]   worry about our kid's college because they can take student loans, but I can't take retirement
[00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:28.200]   loans.
[00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:31.240]   So it's one of those things where we want to make sure that we're all set.
[00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:32.440]   And we have been.
[00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:36.520]   We've gotten to ourselves to a position where we feel like we are going to be able to kind
[00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:40.520]   of coast to retirement and feel pretty comfortable with what we have.
[00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:43.480]   Outside of that, our kids value vacations.
[00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:50.280]   So I think there's something to life experiences today in those zero to 18 years that the kids
[00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:51.640]   are really going to remember.
[00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:55.240]   And them going to college isn't a for sure thing.
[00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:59.320]   They might not want to go to college or they might not have the drive to go to college.
[00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:00.680]   We're going to encourage them to.
[00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:01.480]   We want them to.
[00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:07.640]   But making time for fun today is very important to us.
[00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:11.560]   In fact, after we paid off our mortgage, that was one of the conversations that Nicole and
[00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:12.120]   I had.
[00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:16.840]   We value vacations so much that we need to be setting aside at least 10% of our income
[00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:18.200]   towards vacations.
[00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:19.240]   And so that's what we did.
[00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:23.640]   We sort of filter that money into a different account that's outside of our checking account
[00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:26.520]   that just sits there and starts to build up so that when we look back, we're like, oh,
[00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:27.640]   man, we got five grand in there.
[00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:28.680]   Where are we going to go?
[00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:29.240]   You know?
[00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:31.320]   And then if we use travel hacking, we can go even further.
[00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:33.080]   So that became a priority of ours.
[00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:38.600]   So when people talk about making memories and making fun for it, yeah, if you've saved
[00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:42.440]   up and you are not paying high interest credit card debt and you're checking the boxes to
[00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:46.600]   save towards retirement, money's for fun, man.
[00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:48.360]   Use your money and enjoy your life.
[00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:50.600]   I mean, yes, check those important boxes.
[00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:54.840]   Make sure you're not going into credit card debt to experience all these things.
[00:48:54.840 --> 00:48:59.480]   But if you're checking all the boxes, all the important financial things to do, you've
[00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:03.800]   got enough saved in an emergency, you've paid off your high interest credit card debt, and
[00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:09.400]   you are saving for retirement, then yes, enjoy life and bring the kids along with you.
[00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:15.960]   And what would you say to someone who's like, gosh, I just really struggle with the idea
[00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:22.680]   of spending more money and enjoying my life, knowing that I'm not putting it towards my
[00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:25.320]   kids' college and that they might have to take on debt?
[00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:26.200]   How do you think about that?
[00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:28.200]   Because I think you're a very rational person.
[00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:32.040]   You've talked to lots of people about this, and I think that's something I struggle with
[00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:34.200]   is how do you balance that?
[00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:37.240]   And obviously, you want enough to take a trip, but do you take two trips?
[00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:38.200]   Do you take three trips?
[00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:43.080]   Is there a point at which you balance and start to save for both?
[00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:46.840]   I think college has a lot more ways to slice it than people think.
[00:49:46.840 --> 00:49:52.520]   Obviously, you can invest and save at an early age through a 529 that can help you build
[00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:53.480]   up a good balance.
[00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:58.520]   When they get to that point, let's say you don't have enough, scholarships can be earned.
[00:49:58.520 --> 00:50:04.280]   You can spend some time on the weekends before they graduate where they're filling out scholarship
[00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:06.040]   applications each weekend.
[00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:10.120]   You pump enough of those things out there, you can get tens of thousands of dollars towards
[00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:11.160]   college for sure.
[00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:14.680]   I've talked to enough families that say, this is a reality.
[00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:17.480]   This is something we did to pay for my entire college experience.
[00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:20.280]   It just requires time, dedication.
[00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:23.240]   They can also work in high school.
[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:29.000]   They can get some experience, understand what it means to do hard work and save up for something.
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:30.840]   They can also work in college.
[00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:36.360]   There are ways to hack college a little easier than just saying, hey, I better have every
[00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:40.520]   single penny to make sure we've got enough for them to go to college because otherwise,
[00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:42.520]   they're going to be trapped in student loan debt.
[00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:43.560]   There are different ways to do it.
[00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:47.720]   They can go to community college for the first couple of years and get their credits at a
[00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:52.200]   fraction of the price and then still finish their degree at the university if they want.
[00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:53.800]   There are ways to do it.
[00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:57.800]   I just think sometimes we just take things at face value and I know that I have in the
[00:50:57.800 --> 00:50:58.520]   past.
[00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:01.960]   When I took on my student loans, you just take it as face value and you just go to the
[00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:05.560]   university and you pay it and say, well, everybody's taking on student loans.
[00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:06.520]   You don't have to.
[00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:09.240]   You can do things a little differently and there's lots of different routes to do it.
[00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:15.080]   Yeah, I mean, I think something important there is a lot of us in college, we hadn't
[00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:17.960]   really figured out money and so we took things at face value.
[00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:19.480]   We did what we thought we were supposed to do.
[00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:26.200]   Are you thinking about helping your kids understand money from an earlier age than maybe you did?
[00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:27.080]   Absolutely.
[00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:30.760]   Yeah, and we have started that ever since I think Zoe was four years old.
[00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:33.960]   We've done like a chore and reward program at the house.
[00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:38.040]   So every actually now it's a daily thing with the kids.
[00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:43.800]   So they come home from camp or school and they've got one chore that they need to do
[00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:45.000]   to help the family.
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:48.120]   So they're understanding that they need to contribute.
[00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:49.720]   They need to help around the house.
[00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:54.440]   So that's ever since they were young, it's either like emptying the little garbage cans
[00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:58.520]   around the house, using the little vacuum to clean things, doing laundry.
[00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:02.600]   My son is seven years old and he knows how to do laundry.
[00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:05.560]   And I know some 18, 20-year-olds that don't know how to do laundry.
[00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:06.760]   My seven-year-old knows how to do it.
[00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:12.600]   And so we're teaching them life skills, but then also giving them money to mess up with.
[00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:16.360]   So we give them a dollar for every year they've lived.
[00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:18.920]   So Zoe gets $9, Calvin gets $7.
[00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:24.840]   And we now direct deposit that directly into their Ally savings accounts or their checking
[00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:25.240]   accounts.
[00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:26.840]   They have their own debit cards.
[00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:30.600]   So when they want to purchase something, they've got enough money in their checking account
[00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:31.160]   to do that.
[00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:36.280]   And I have conversations with my daughter about understanding that there's shipping,
[00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:38.360]   there's tax, there's things like that.
[00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:42.920]   These conversations are happening early enough where I feel like she's going to be a smart,
[00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:44.200]   educated young woman.
[00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:47.080]   And yes, are there mistakes?
[00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:51.880]   Yes, I'm so glad that they're making mistakes now at nine and seven as opposed to 29 and
[00:52:51.880 --> 00:52:58.120]   27 when it's $50,000 instead of maybe $5 that we're dealing with with the mistakes.
[00:52:58.120 --> 00:53:01.560]   So I'm excited about those conversations that we're having together.
[00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:02.760]   They're learning hard work.
[00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:05.560]   They're learning that with that hard work, they get a reward.
[00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:11.560]   And not only are we talking about spending with them, but we also divide their earnings
[00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:12.440]   into other buckets.
[00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:16.520]   So they've got an investment bucket, they've got a savings bucket, and they've also got
[00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:21.720]   a giving bucket because we feel in our family that it's important to give back as well because
[00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:24.920]   not only it's the right thing to do in society, but we've had some privilege in our life.
[00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:26.360]   So we feel like we have to give back.
[00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:29.720]   So we have a conversation with them every three months where they sort of empty that
[00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:31.480]   digital giving jar.
[00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:35.800]   And we talk about what they're feeling grateful for, what they're feeling excited about in
[00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:36.120]   life.
[00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:41.560]   And then we talk about charities that honor that thanks to people who maybe don't have
[00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:41.880]   that.
[00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:45.160]   So, for example, my son is really happy with the house that he has.
[00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:46.680]   He really likes having a roof over his head.
[00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:50.360]   So he gives to a charity called, say, Detroit that helps people who don't have homes in
[00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:51.480]   Metro Detroit.
[00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:54.680]   And he's given to that charity now for two years.
[00:53:54.680 --> 00:54:00.120]   We wrote a little letter to Mitch Albom, who runs that charity, and he featured Calvin
[00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:03.320]   on his radio show at, I think it was four years old, five years old.
[00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:07.560]   And that was one of those moments where I'm like, "Man, my son, he might not remember
[00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:08.840]   this, but I'm going to keep that video."
[00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:12.680]   And it's going to be one of those things that he's going to be like, "Yeah, I've been given
[00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:14.120]   since I was four or five."
[00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:18.760]   And he understands the power of that and understands that money can not only do great
[00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:22.280]   things for your life, but it can also do great things for other people who are in need.
[00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:26.280]   So we're having lots of conversations with the kids, and I hope that they come away with
[00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:28.840]   something after this 18 years in our house.
[00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:30.760]   - That's awesome.
[00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:35.480]   Any lessons you've learned about teaching kids money that maybe weren't so obvious that
[00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:36.280]   have been really helpful?
[00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:40.440]   - Yeah, in the beginning, we would give them the money and we say, "Hey, here it is in
[00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:41.560]   your account.
[00:54:41.560 --> 00:54:42.680]   Enjoy it and spend it."
[00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:46.440]   And then it was one of those things that we were dealing with contentment problems.
[00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:50.920]   So they would buy something, and then 10 minutes later, they'd be like, "All right, this isn't
[00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:52.200]   any fun anymore.
[00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:53.560]   Can I buy something else right now?"
[00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:55.400]   And in the beginning, it was like, "Oh, yeah, sure.
[00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:56.280]   You got the money in your account.
[00:54:56.280 --> 00:54:57.160]   Yeah, go ahead."
[00:54:57.160 --> 00:55:00.360]   And then it was one of those things where it's like, "Man, we're creating little consumers.
[00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:01.800]   We're creating little crazy consumers.
[00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:05.320]   They bought this thing, they used it for 10 minutes, and now it's all sitting over in
[00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:07.960]   the corner, little plastic thing, and now they're going to buy the next thing."
[00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:10.680]   And then Nicole and I were like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, we got to stop this.
[00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:12.040]   This is a little crazy.
[00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:15.240]   We're going to limit the purchases to once a month.
[00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:16.680]   You guys enjoy the toys.
[00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:18.200]   You can buy what you have.
[00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:19.560]   You have got the money in there.
[00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:24.040]   Enjoy it for a while, and then next month, we can try something new."
[00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:28.520]   Because we don't want to just create little mindless spenders because then they're not
[00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:29.400]   going to have any...
[00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:32.360]   They're going to say, "Hey, man, this thing doesn't give me the happiness that I want.
[00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:33.960]   I need something else right away."
[00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:34.840]   And that's not what we want.
[00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:39.960]   We do want them to understand that not every toy is going to be fantastic, but we also
[00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:42.360]   don't want to have them buying things over and over again.
[00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:46.680]   Because Nicole's more of a minimalist kind of design in the home, and she doesn't really
[00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:47.480]   like a lot of clutter.
[00:55:47.480 --> 00:55:51.160]   So when we've got a lot of things in here, it's either, "Can we sell this on Facebook?
[00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:52.040]   Can we give it away?
[00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:53.960]   Or do something else with it?"
[00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:57.240]   Have you taught the kids to start selling stuff on Facebook Marketplace yet?
[00:55:57.240 --> 00:55:57.800]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:55:57.800 --> 00:55:59.320]   Zoe is currently...
[00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:00.360]   She's got what she got listed.
[00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:01.720]   She's got a couple of posters listed.
[00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:03.000]   She's got some toys listed.
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:05.320]   Calvin's selling some Beyblades right now.
[00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:10.760]   He just got $15 for some old toys, and that's going to go into his digital jars.
[00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:11.960]   So yeah, we do it together.
[00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:13.480]   We take the photos together.
[00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:17.080]   Zoe's gotten old enough where she can kind of input the description and the photos and
[00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:18.120]   kind of do it all herself.
[00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:20.920]   So Calvin requires a little bit more help from dad.
[00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:21.420]   So...
[00:56:21.420 --> 00:56:27.960]   I just am now imagining my childhood of the garage sale, not the digital online garage
[00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:28.280]   sale.
[00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:28.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:32.200]   Facebook Marketplace is fantastic because you can ship all around the country, and they
[00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:33.320]   print out the label for you.
[00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:34.440]   It just kind of creates it a little...
[00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:35.240]   Makes it a little easier.
[00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:37.320]   I love that.
[00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:40.360]   Now, again, outside of money with kids, I'm a new dad.
[00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:41.480]   I've got a one-year-old.
[00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:43.000]   I've got a journey ahead of me.
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:47.560]   What advice do you have for me to make both the journey with the children and the journey
[00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:49.480]   with the family more efficient, more...
[00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:51.160]   Just better?
[00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:51.960]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:55.960]   I especially remember the young years, especially with my kids.
[00:56:55.960 --> 00:57:01.240]   I would say a lot of it has to do with making the space and time to learn how they also
[00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:02.520]   like to be loved.
[00:57:02.520 --> 00:57:04.440]   Calvin is very much like his mother.
[00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:05.320]   He likes time.
[00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:09.000]   He likes time with his dad, and he likes words of affirmation.
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:13.960]   And then my daughter's always more about, like, cuddling and affection and, you know,
[00:57:13.960 --> 00:57:15.480]   just kind of being close to each other.
[00:57:15.480 --> 00:57:19.960]   So learning how your kids like to be loved is also important.
[00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:25.320]   And I've learned that over the years, that they like different things, and they require
[00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:26.600]   different attention.
[00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:31.960]   And with that attention, I have dedicated one-on-one time with them each month.
[00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:37.080]   So Calvin will get one month, and then Zoe will get another, where they get to choose
[00:57:37.080 --> 00:57:41.400]   for two to three hours, we're going to go do something, whatever you want to do.
[00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:42.760]   We're going to go wherever you want to go.
[00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:46.920]   Calvin likes to go to, like, a play place with, like, trampolines and stuff like that.
[00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:49.560]   Zoe likes to go see Marvel movies.
[00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:55.000]   So just creating that dedicated time where I'm giving them all of me and putting away
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:58.520]   my phone and turning it off is really great for us.
[00:57:58.520 --> 00:58:03.000]   And when you've got multiple kids in the house, it can lead to some, you know, sort
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:04.520]   of resentment and some jealousy.
[00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:07.960]   So when you're able to give that dedicated time, that's been very helpful.
[00:58:07.960 --> 00:58:12.120]   I got that, you know, a hack from a great book that I read called The Family Board Meeting
[00:58:12.120 --> 00:58:16.840]   by Jim Shields, where he talks about this concept of 18 summers.
[00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:23.880]   We only have 18 summers before our kids are off to college or off to doing their own thing.
[00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:27.320]   So how can we make that time really special?
[00:58:27.320 --> 00:58:29.160]   And how can we make some great memories together?
[00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:31.720]   So that one-on-one time has been really special for us.
[00:58:31.720 --> 00:58:34.280]   Yeah, any other?
[00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:37.720]   I haven't read a lot of books on family and parenting.
[00:58:37.720 --> 00:58:38.920]   It's all a little new.
[00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:40.840]   Any other recommendations there?
[00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:47.320]   Well, as far as the marriage side of things, I really liked this book from the Holderness
[00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:50.520]   family called Everybody Fights, so why not get better at it?
[00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:56.120]   And this is a family that is very popular on YouTube and online, but they wrote this
[00:58:56.120 --> 00:58:58.600]   book because they often fight.
[00:58:58.600 --> 00:59:05.080]   They're pretty emotional, excited kind of people, but they talk about ways to make fighting,
[00:59:05.080 --> 00:59:07.960]   because it's inevitable, ways to make fighting easier.
[00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:13.640]   And one hack that they had in the book was just sort of being like, "Hey, if you've just
[00:59:13.640 --> 00:59:18.600]   recently been in a fight, try to think about what's an easy trigger that it caused.
[00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:20.600]   You know, were you guys drinking?
[00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:21.720]   Was somebody really tired?
[00:59:21.720 --> 00:59:22.760]   Was somebody hangry?
[00:59:22.760 --> 00:59:26.840]   Did something add to this that made it even more intense?"
[00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:31.400]   And sort of recognize that as you guys are describing this horrible fight that you've
[00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:35.320]   been in now, and maybe have some humility and say, "Hey, you know what?
[00:59:35.320 --> 00:59:39.400]   I was a little bit more tired than I normally was because I was sort of, whatever, day drinking,
[00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:44.040]   or I had not gotten good sleep the night before, or whatever it was."
[00:59:44.040 --> 00:59:47.720]   And just sort of approaching the fight with some humility.
[00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:50.520]   Also, understanding how people like to fight.
[00:59:50.520 --> 00:59:55.320]   For example, Nicole, when we get into fights, she needs some space afterward.
[00:59:55.320 --> 01:00:00.280]   I'm always the one who wants to quick fix it, being like, "Okay, let's resolve this
[01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:00.600]   right now.
[01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:01.480]   Let's talk through it."
[01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:02.440]   And she's like, "No, dude.
[01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:04.040]   I need to kind of go away.
[01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:05.000]   I need some space."
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:10.200]   And so sort of understanding how people like to fight, how people like to resolve things
[01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:13.800]   was a good concept in that book, and I really enjoyed it.
[01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:15.560]   - Yeah.
[01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:18.600]   I learned that the hard way, which is I'm like you.
[01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:23.480]   We're arguing about something, and I'm like, "Let's just see if we can resolve this thing
[01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:24.040]   right now."
[01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:28.520]   And in our relationship, one of the ways to get your point across is to find the most
[01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:29.880]   effective time to present it.
[01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:32.760]   And for me, it's not right after a conflict.
[01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:34.360]   It's not right before bed.
[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:39.320]   Like, I know that those two times make it less compelling for me to get my point across.
[01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:44.760]   And so in the same way that if I want to try to present an idea at work, I'm going to put
[01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:49.400]   the time and energy into when's the right time to share it with my team, maybe put together
[01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:50.280]   a presentation.
[01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:55.720]   I just apply similar thoughts to, "Okay, when's the right time to present this idea?"
[01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:59.560]   I think maybe we should take an extra vacation this year.
[01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:01.480]   That's not something that I want to bring up.
[01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:05.160]   If we're going to bed, it's like, "Hey, I know you're about to fall asleep.
[01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:08.440]   But do you want to have this big conversation about how we could spend some money on a trip?"
[01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:09.880]   It doesn't go well.
[01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:14.520]   And for me, I've tried to explain, "Well, look, we don't need to talk about it now.
[01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:17.640]   But just know that the reason I'm bringing it up isn't because we have to.
[01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:18.680]   I'm just so excited."
[01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:23.320]   And so it goes back to something you said earlier, which is understanding the motivations
[01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:26.040]   behind why people do things is really important.
[01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:26.600]   Absolutely.
[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:26.760]   Yeah.
[01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:30.040]   Nicole likes to squash that, "Don't go to bed angry."
[01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:32.600]   You know, that adage where it's like, "No, no, no.
[01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:33.640]   I just need to go to bed."
[01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:39.960]   Yeah. And understanding that is often very helpful.
[01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:40.360]   Absolutely.
[01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:42.440]   I talked about it in the introduction here.
[01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:48.600]   But what led you to be someone who decided this was going to be your career, right?
[01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:51.800]   You quit your job and you now run Marriage, Kids, and Money.
[01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:54.680]   And you've got videos, you've got a podcast, you've got a blog.
[01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:58.120]   How do you describe how that became your thing?
[01:01:58.120 --> 01:01:58.520]   Yeah.
[01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:02.360]   About 5 years ago, I was having a really bad day at work.
[01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:07.720]   And it was one of those things where we got new management at the company.
[01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:11.720]   And with that new management, all of a sudden, they made some changes on the teams.
[01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:14.120]   They said, "Andy, you're not on that team anymore.
[01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:15.000]   You're on this team.
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.560]   And the people reporting to you are now not reporting to you.
[01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:18.920]   You're reporting to this guy."
[01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:24.440]   And it was one of those things where I was like, "Man, I don't really have any ownership
[01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:27.720]   of my life here at this career.
[01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:31.800]   It's something that I feel like I'm not in control of."
[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:35.480]   And at home, I've got two very young kids at the time.
[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:37.000]   They've got a 3-year-old and a 1-year-old.
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.680]   And I have no control there either.
[01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:42.840]   So I'm like, "Okay, what's something that I can do that's sort of like a hobby, something
[01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:46.920]   that I can grab onto that just makes me feel like, I don't know, I need something?"
[01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:49.560]   And so I had been listening to podcasts around that time.
[01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:51.240]   And I said, "Well, why don't I just start a podcast?
[01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:51.880]   I think that could be fun.
[01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:52.760]   I have something to share.
[01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:54.120]   I want to learn from people.
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:56.920]   It could be a great way as an outlet."
[01:02:56.920 --> 01:02:57.400]   So I did that.
[01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:59.880]   I decided to start Marriage, Kids, and Money in 2016.
[01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:03.480]   And it was one of those things where I'd share a little bit about our journey.
[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:06.680]   And then I would interview really smart people that would help us on our journey or just
[01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:08.360]   help people who are listening as well.
[01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:13.400]   And then over time, people started to listen, which was great, outside of my wife and my
[01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:14.520]   mom, which was awesome.
[01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:17.480]   And I started to get some podcast sponsors.
[01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:20.120]   And then people wanted to work with me on different things.
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:23.560]   And so it started to become not just a hobby, but a side hustle.
[01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:26.360]   And then over time, it started to grow even more.
[01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:32.760]   And it got to a point where I had amassed enough money and savings, and we had done
[01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:37.160]   well enough in our financial life where it was one of those things where it's like, "Let's
[01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:37.800]   take a risk.
[01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:42.920]   Let's take a jump and try to do something that's not, I don't know, prescriptive, like
[01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:44.200]   what I'm supposed to do."
[01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:47.720]   And Nicole was very—actually, she encouraged me to do it, really.
[01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:51.000]   So I took the leap to do it full-time in January 2020.
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.240]   I had some contracts.
[01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:55.480]   I had some sponsorships.
[01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:57.320]   Things were kind of set in place.
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:04:00.680]   And yes, it was two months right before the pandemic hit.
[01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:02.920]   But a year and a half later, I'm still standing.
[01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:07.800]   So there was lots of ups and downs with different contracts and clients and partnerships and
[01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:08.360]   things like that.
[01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:10.920]   But all in all, we've been doing well.
[01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:11.880]   Life's good.
[01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:13.160]   Things are growing well.
[01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:16.120]   I really love the work that I do every single day.
[01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:18.040]   I get to learn.
[01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:19.160]   I get to help people.
[01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:22.680]   And at the end of the day, I'm extremely happy.
[01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:26.440]   I am doing work that I love, and I'm able to be paid for it.
[01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:29.160]   So that's life to me, man.
[01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:30.840]   Yeah.
[01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:32.280]   I'm a big fan of all your work.
[01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:33.640]   Where can people find it?
[01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:36.360]   What are the different avenues that you produce content for?
[01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:36.760]   Absolutely.
[01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:40.120]   Well, if you're listening to this podcast, the best thing to do is just to type in "Marriage,
[01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:42.280]   Kids, and Money" in your favorite podcast player.
[01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:44.600]   That is the great place to connect with me.
[01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:46.920]   We do YouTube videos as well.
[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:50.520]   So if you're a YouTube person, you can type in "Marriage, Kids, and Money" there as well.

[01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:25.560]   So that's coming out soon.
[01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:26.600]   And that's it for now.
[01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:28.040]   So thank you so much for listening.
[01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:41.320]   See you next week.
[01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:49.560]   I want to tell you about another podcast I love that goes deep on all things money.
[01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:53.400]   That means everything from money hacks to wealth building to early retirement.
[01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:55.640]   It's called the Personal Finance Podcast.
[01:05:55.640 --> 01:06:00.120]   And it's much more about building generational wealth and spending your money on the things
[01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:03.640]   you value than it is about clipping coupons to save a dollar.
[01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:07.800]   It's hosted by my good friend, Andrew, who truly believes that everyone in this world
[01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:08.760]   can build wealth.
[01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:12.920]   And his passion and excitement are what make this show so entertaining.
[01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:16.760]   I know because I was a guest on the show in December 2022.
[01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:21.560]   But recently, I listened to an episode where Andrew shared 16 money stats that will blow
[01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:22.360]   your mind.
[01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:27.480]   And it was so crazy to learn things like 35% of millennials are not participating in their
[01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:29.000]   employer's retirement plan.
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.680]   And that's just one of the many fascinating stats he shared.
[01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:35.400]   The Personal Finance Podcast has something for everyone.
[01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:39.240]   It's filled with so many tips and tactics and hacks to help you get better with your
[01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:40.920]   money and grow your wealth.
[01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:43.000]   So I highly recommend you check it out.
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:47.720]   Just search for the Personal Finance Podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you
[01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:49.640]   listen to podcasts and enjoy.
