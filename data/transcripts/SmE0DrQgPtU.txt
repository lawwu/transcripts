[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.320]   Braddock writes in, "Pastor John,
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.560]   "in episode number 450,
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.340]   "you talked about God's preordination.
[00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:13.660]   "In that episode, you also mentioned
[00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.740]   "that in your early 20s, you were almost tormented
[00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.180]   "by theological questions and difficulties
[00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.200]   "to the extent to where you would lay your head down
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.580]   "on your desk and weep for hours.
[00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.500]   "What advice would you give to a 23-year-old
[00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.640]   "who is in this exact same position now?"
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.640]   - I wanna give empathy before I give advice. (laughs)
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.720]   I have memories and I'm laughing,
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.440]   but good night, it was hard.
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.000]   I think the best thing I can do for Braddock
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.640]   from where I stand, I mean, I don't know what he's unsure of.
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.720]   I don't know what he's wrestling with.
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.160]   I don't know how central or how marginal
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.840]   or how total his struggles are.
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.420]   So since I don't know all that,
[00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.420]   I think the best thing I can do is to encourage him
[00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.600]   that the distress of confusion in the mind of God's child
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.440]   will not last.
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:17.520]   It is part of a natural process of growth.
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.880]   Sometimes growth from less understanding
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.920]   to more understanding is very incremental
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.880]   and almost indiscernible.
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.880]   And other times it is fast and massively disruptive
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.500]   and therefore painful.
[00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.140]   I recall when I was 14, this is an analogy,
[00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.220]   I grew so fast that my shins hurt.
[00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.460]   I grew past my mother, I grew past my father.
[00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.000]   It was exciting.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.460]   It's like growth is exciting.
[00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:52.820]   Growth in your mind is exciting,
[00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.020]   growth in your body is exciting, and it was painful.
[00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.580]   There were days I couldn't walk.
[00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:58.660]   We went to the doctor and he said,
[00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.500]   "It's growing pains, it's growing pains."
[00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.980]   Well, I don't like these growing pains.
[00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.420]   When will they go away?
[00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.980]   That's an analogy.
[00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.100]   Or here's another picture.
[00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.880]   This I think is more helpful.
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.780]   The human mind is designed by God for coherence and order
[00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.580]   where things fit together
[00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.100]   and they don't absolutely contradict each other.
[00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.700]   God is not a God of confusion.
[00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.220]   And when I read the Bible, I see the apostles,
[00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.940]   for example, arguing.
[00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.960]   I see the prophets arguing in ways that show
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.040]   they assume the human mind in the image of God
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.960]   will not tolerate absolute contradiction.
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.180]   Things need to fit together in some sense
[00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.180]   of order or coherence.
[00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.380]   Yes is not no.
[00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.300]   No is not yes.
[00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.980]   So the mind is bent on putting things together
[00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.760]   as best it can, like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle.
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.860]   Or if I knew my puzzles better,
[00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.400]   I could come up with a better example about this.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.260]   But I have in my mind that if one of these pieces
[00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.260]   is taken out because you see the Bible teaching now
[00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.340]   something different than that piece that was put in there,
[00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.820]   that puzzle piece of knowledge was put in your brain
[00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.180]   when you were 10 and now you're reading your Bible
[00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.420]   and you say, "That's not a Bible piece."
[00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.900]   And it comes out, what happens?
[00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.900]   Well, the other pieces become, they move a little bit.
[00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.100]   They move a little bit because you might have to jostle
[00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:42.100]   15 pieces to put the new Bible piece back in.
[00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.700]   And here's what I think makes us frightened and weeping.
[00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.460]   It feels as though all of those 15 pieces might be wrong.
[00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:56.060]   They move, they shifted out of the position that they had.
[00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.260]   The thing that was giving them coherence
[00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.500]   just suddenly is gone.
[00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.580]   And now we wonder, "Good night,
[00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.220]   have I got to dismantle my whole mind?
[00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.180]   I don't even know if I can handle all the pieces
[00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.060]   of my mind going out."
[00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.020]   That's probably not true.
[00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.700]   It's that the pieces are moving,
[00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.180]   trying to find their place again in the coherence.
[00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.620]   And the more true pieces you put in,
[00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.020]   it may take some time,
[00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.100]   but when those other pieces settle
[00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.940]   into their God appointed niche, it is so good.
[00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.860]   It's not only a peaceful feeling like,
[00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.820]   "Oh, this is right.
[00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:36.660]   This is right.
[00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:37.940]   This fits my soul.
[00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.300]   This fits the world."
[00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.980]   But you've now got, continue the analogy
[00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.820]   of the jigsaw puzzle, you got a picture.
[00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.220]   This picture is more beautiful than the other picture.
[00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.180]   That other picture always seemed to have the nose
[00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.420]   out of place, or it wasn't quite what it ought to be.
[00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:00.380]   God's will is for our growth.
[00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.380]   Second Peter 3, 18, "Grow in the grace and knowledge
[00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:05.860]   of our Lord and Savior."
[00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.420]   Go on, be about growing in knowledge.
[00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:11.660]   Philippians 1, 9, "My prayer is that your love
[00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.180]   may abound more and more with knowledge
[00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.140]   and all discernment."
[00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:18.780]   Colossians 1, 10, "Walk in a manner worthy of the Lord,
[00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.580]   fully pleasing to Him, bearing fruit in every good work,
[00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.060]   increasing in the knowledge of God."
[00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.900]   But here's the catch.
[00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.300]   Those all sound, "Oh, fine.
[00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.300]   Yeah, let's just grow.
[00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.540]   Let's just add, add, add."
[00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.580]   Here comes 2 Corinthians 10, verse five.
[00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.940]   Paul says, "We destroy arguments,
[00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:43.700]   and every lofty opinion raised against the knowledge of God,
[00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.500]   and every thought we take captive to obey Christ."
[00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.580]   You know, when we read that as Christians, we tend to think,
[00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.220]   okay, I got to get in sync with Paul and do that.
[00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.900]   I got to do some knowledge imparting,
[00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.420]   and I got to destroy some arguments out there in the world.
[00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:01.260]   And we forget that, whoa, that happens to us.
[00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.820]   That happens to us.
[00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:08.820]   I mean, I assume that not every opinion in my brain
[00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.620]   is a perfect opinion,
[00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.780]   and there may be some lofty opinions
[00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.820]   that get in there from time to time,
[00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:17.900]   or left over from when I was a kid,
[00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.420]   that need to be torn down.
[00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.820]   And when that happens, I guarantee you,
[00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:26.500]   that demolition by the apostle hurts.
[00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:30.540]   Just not comfortable to have any of your thoughts,
[00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:33.620]   especially if they're old or cherished or from mom and dad,
[00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:37.180]   torn down by the apostle's teaching.
[00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.740]   So just two encouragements.
[00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:43.460]   God does not leave us alone in our thinking.
[00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:46.220]   In putting the pieces back together,
[00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.920]   we are not left to ourselves.
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:52.740]   2 Timothy 2:7, "Think over what I say."
[00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.440]   So yes, you got to be thinking,
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.620]   and it's painful to be moving these pieces around
[00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.980]   in your brain, but that's what thinking is.
[00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:01.340]   And the next phrase says,
[00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:05.620]   "For the Lord will give you understanding in everything."
[00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:10.140]   In other words, don't begrudge the season of sorrow
[00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:13.540]   and frustration as the pieces are being moved around
[00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:15.140]   in your mind.
[00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.660]   That's an evidence that your mind
[00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:20.460]   is not content with confusion,
[00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:24.100]   and that it's a sign that you're made by God
[00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:29.100]   for something more, and God will give you understanding.
[00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:32.500]   He's not going to leave you alone.
[00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:36.620]   And the last encouragement is, "Do what the psalmist did."
[00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.700]   Psalm 118, verse five, "Out of my distress,
[00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:42.500]   "I called on the Lord."
[00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:45.180]   I'm sure you're doing that.
[00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:47.660]   "Out of my distress, I called on the Lord.
[00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:51.540]   "The Lord answered me and set me free.
[00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:53.540]   "The Lord is on my side.
[00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:54.540]   "I will not fear.
[00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:55.620]   "What can man do to me?"
[00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:58.780]   Literally, I just checked it in the Hebrew a few minutes ago.
[00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:00.460]   It said, when it says,
[00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:03.660]   "The Lord answered me and set me free,"
[00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:08.660]   literally, it's put me in a broad place.
[00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:12.460]   I'm not trapped anymore.
[00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:14.060]   I'm not pinned down.
[00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:15.180]   I'm not cornered.
[00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:19.100]   I'm not frustrated in my confused position anymore.
[00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.940]   He brought me out of my frustration,
[00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:24.980]   gave me a broad place in which to walk,
[00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:29.060]   and this new picture of God in my mind
[00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:31.180]   is a beautiful place.
[00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:34.260]   - Wonderful, thank you, Pastor John.

[00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:48.300]   So what is the key to ministry longevity?
[00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:50.740]   This is an important question leaders face,
[00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:53.180]   and the answer can be found in the life and legacy
[00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:56.460]   of 18th century pastor John Newton,
[00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:58.820]   as John Piper will explain tomorrow.
[00:08:58.820 --> 00:08:59.820]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:02.740]   Thank you for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
