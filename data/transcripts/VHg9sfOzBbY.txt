[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500]   The following is a conversation with Ryan Hall,
[00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.400]   his second time in the podcast.
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.800]   He's one of the most innovative scholars of martial arts
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.760]   in the modern era.
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.780]   Quick mention of our sponsors.
[00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.280]   Indeed hiring website, Audible Audiobooks, ExpressVPN,
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.780]   and Element Electrolyte Drink.

[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.920]   and to support this podcast.
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.960]   As a side note, let me say that I've gotten a chance
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.180]   to train with Ryan recently and to both discuss
[00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.560]   and try out on the mat his ideas
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.480]   about grappling and fighting.
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.120]   What struck me is his unapologetic drive
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.560]   to solve martial arts.
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.640]   It reminds me of the ambitious vision
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.720]   and effort of Google's DeepMind to solve intelligence.
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.320]   In Ryan's case, this isn't some out there
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.040]   martial arts guru talk.
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.480]   This is a style of thinking about the game of human chess,
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.080]   of seeking to define the rules and to engineer ways
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.120]   from first principles of escaping the constraints
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.560]   of those rules.
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.480]   This style of thinking is rare,
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.560]   but it's ultimately the one that leads to the discovery
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.880]   of new revolutionary ideas.

[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.160]   You're known as a systems thinker in martial arts,
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.520]   but you also, I think, are willing to think
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.200]   outside the rules of the game, outside of the system.
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.360]   When you're thinking about strategies of how to,
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.200]   you know, solve the problem, particular problem
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.440]   of an opponent, whether that's jiu-jitsu
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.200]   or in mixed martial arts, what's your process
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.720]   for doing that, for figuring out that puzzle?
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.740]   - I would say, I don't know if I have a specific,
[00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.560]   like A to B to C process for that sort of thing.
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.280]   I try to do my best to appreciate that.
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.240]   I think a lot of the thinking,
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.000]   or maybe not all the thinking,
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.840]   but a lot of great thinking on conflict,
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.720]   on battle, on war, on martial arts has been done already.
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.520]   Not that we don't have to do any sort
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.880]   of a background investigation or reassessing
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.180]   of these ideas or axioms that have come down
[00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:11.920]   through things like the Book of Five Rings
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.120]   or the Art of War, or, you know, like von Clausewitz,
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.920]   even anything like that, really.
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.000]   But is, we're trying to understand the lessons
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.800]   of the past that I think oftentimes
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.840]   we don't take with us, problems on, we pay lip service.
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.640]   And like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you know,
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.840]   a victorious fighter, the great fighter, you know,
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.560]   he knows victory is there, then he seeks battle.
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.480]   Everyone else is looking for victory in battle.
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.120]   Yeah, moving on, and that's why I'm gonna double jab
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.360]   and throw my left hand.
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.640]   And I think a lot of times our actions don't reflect
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.000]   our stated belief structure.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   And I think that oftentimes you can tell what I believe
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.560]   really, or what my fundamental operating system is,
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.360]   based on my actions, whether I'm aware,
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.880]   I have an operating system internally,
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.280]   whether I'm aware of it or not,
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.120]   or certainly whether I'm fully aware of it.
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.280]   So I guess when it comes to strategy,
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.560]   I try to think about how things interact.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.920]   You mentioned systems thinking,
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.400]   and I try to do my best to understand how systems exist,
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.720]   but I think that systems have a fundamental strength
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.200]   and a fundamental weakness.
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.040]   They work how they work, and that's great,
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.520]   but they're readable.
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.080]   So if you are aware, if I am operating on a system
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.840]   of which you're not really read into,
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.680]   then I think oftentimes I can seem shockingly effective,
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.080]   particularly if my system preys on certain weaknesses
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.080]   that maybe you're given to.
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.440]   But what happens when you've read the same books
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.520]   that I have?
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.960]   I think that a lot of times
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.360]   that makes me deeply predictable.
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.520]   I think about systems in jujitsu,
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.440]   and a lot of times people think that they're doing jujitsu
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.560]   when in reality they are doing an expression of it.
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.480]   Let's say I'll use, there's the Marcelo Garcia system.
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.920]   There is the Henzo Gracie, current Henzo Gracie system.
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.480]   There's the old Gracie Baha one.
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.600]   There's the Gracie Academy, classic Gracie jujitsu.
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.160]   There's the art of jujitsu, kind of Atos approach.
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.760]   And there's some crossover between a lot of these,
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.120]   but oftentimes I think when it comes
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.440]   to understanding how I'm making decisions
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.200]   and how my opponent is making decisions,
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.120]   I have to appreciate whether or not
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.400]   I'm an end user of something,
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.480]   and I'll use my phone as an example.
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.920]   I was thinking of this the other day,
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.800]   and as an end user of my phone,
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.680]   I have no idea what it does.
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.360]   You know, like Edward Snowden comes up and goes,
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.440]   "Hey guys, you realize your phones are listening to you?"
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.080]   I'm like, "Really? What?"
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.200]   All right, I believe you.
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.840]   And then of course that comes out,
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.600]   but to what extent?
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.520]   I have no idea.
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.880]   What is my phone capable of?
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:41.920]   I have no idea.
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.040]   I can mess with the font though.
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.320]   I really like blue screens, not purple screens.
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.440]   So like as an end user,
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.080]   I can change some of the bells and whistles
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.280]   that have nothing to do with the underlying source code
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.360]   of it all or how it functions.
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.440]   The same way my car, I'm an end user of my car.
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.320]   If I do this with the steering wheel, it goes.
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.480]   If I push on the gas, it goes.
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.600]   If I, yeah, I know how to fix it when it's out of gas.
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.120]   I know how to fix it when it's out of oil,
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.600]   and I know how to fix it when a flat tire comes,
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.520]   but short of that or actually beyond that, I have nothing.
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.760]   So I think that oftentimes, you know,
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.440]   I've been around in jiu-jitsu long enough
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.640]   to encounter like a new wave of like good grapplers,
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.200]   and it's very, very interesting sometimes
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.720]   how they're running systems
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.160]   they don't realize they're running.
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.000]   Like I'm like, oh yeah,
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.840]   I trained at Marcelo Garcia's Academy for a long time,
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.680]   you know, and a big fan of Marcelo's was a student there.
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.200]   Encountered a lot of the auto style jiu-jitsu
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.040]   a number of years ago.
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.120]   Been, you know, a very, very, you know,
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.720]   deep into foot locking and leg attacks and whatnot
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.200]   for a long, long time.
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.360]   I understand your system better than you do, or I may.
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.720]   And let's say you understand my system better than I do.
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:43.640]   That would be a huge issue.
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.920]   That was something that I encountered a long time ago
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.120]   trying to come up in jiu-jitsu
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.480]   where I was trying to utilize systems
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.480]   that were created by, let's say,
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:54.760]   Hoffman Mendez or someone else.
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.720]   And I'm basically trying to do what you're doing.
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.640]   I'm just not doing as good of a version of it.
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.520]   So not only am I not doing it well,
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.360]   but I'm entirely predictable.
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.920]   And I think that that can be a big issue.
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.640]   So to come back, I think of systems a lot of times now
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:07.480]   in terms of, you know,
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.240]   particularly like end user type of systems,
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.760]   like an iPhone is a really, really fast way
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.160]   for me to be able to do all sorts of things.
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.240]   If you were to take it from me,
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.120]   I couldn't recreate any of that.
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.320]   - So you want to be more the NSA and less the end user.
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.280]   - Exactly, exactly.
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.120]   That way I'm listening to you.
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.000]   - You want to be the NSA of combat.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.440]   - That's right, we're watching you pee.
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.360]   But basically, you know,
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.720]   I guess what I would come back and say is
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.280]   if you understand how things interact
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.240]   on a fundamental level and what type of games exist
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.840]   and what type of interactions exist,
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.000]   then you can transcend a lot of the systems.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.440]   It's almost like a cook versus,
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.800]   if I can make certain things in the kitchen,
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.360]   but I am not a chef.
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.960]   You could give me a bunch of ingredients
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.680]   and I could probably cook not well,
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.320]   but a couple of different things.
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.800]   But a master chef, you know,
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.640]   would be aware of the implications
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.200]   of all of the things that they're doing,
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.800]   you know, extra time in the oven,
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.200]   less time in the oven,
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.760]   putting this, you know, flavoring or spice in,
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.680]   you know, what you're doing with various things.
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:05.760]   And also they could make,
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.560]   they could turn all of these ingredients into Chinese food.
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.080]   Or they could turn all these ingredients into Italian food
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:10.720]   and they could turn all these Italian food ingredients
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.520]   into chicken Parmesan, or it could turn into lasagna.
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.080]   But they're not limited to a specific thing
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.440]   because they have knowledge of how food interacts,
[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.040]   how, what it does to create taste,
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.400]   what it does to create texture.
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.160]   So to come back, let's take rock, paper, scissors.
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.720]   Rock, paper, scissors is built on the idea
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.000]   of a couple of different things.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.400]   Actually, I'll tell you what, can I,
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.760]   may I ask you a question?
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:31.600]   - Yeah.
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.640]   - What's your favorite dinosaur?
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.000]   On the same, on three, we'll go.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.080]   One, two, three.
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:37.920]   - T-Rex. - T-Rex.
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:38.760]   Oh, me too.
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.480]   No, man, this is, we're going to be best friends.
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.660]   So it's, okay.
[00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:45.420]   If, so what's the first question when you say,
[00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:46.500]   hey, let's play rock, paper, scissors.
[00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:47.700]   It's like, hey, is it rock, paper, scissors
[00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:49.260]   or rock, paper, scissors, shoot?
[00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:50.660]   And you're like, rock, paper, scissors, shoot.
[00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:51.500]   And you're like, okay.
[00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:55.460]   Because if we go rock, paper, scissors, shoot.
[00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:58.060]   And I'm like, oh man, I got lucky and I won.
[00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:00.420]   Imagine I won a hundred times in a row.
[00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:01.420]   - Yeah. - I'd be luck.
[00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:04.260]   It'd be luck if I was honestly doing that.
[00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:05.580]   But now let's say, for instance,
[00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:08.180]   I go on rock, paper, scissors and you go on shoot.
[00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:11.620]   Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.
[00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:12.820]   Here comes the rock, right?
[00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:15.760]   If you lose, whose fault is it?
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.140]   It's yours.
[00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:19.420]   This is built on a parody thing where
[00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:22.600]   I don't get to pick second.
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.140]   If I get to pick second,
[00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:26.320]   it's like being able to investigate your background
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:27.260]   before going to meet you.
[00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:28.340]   And then I'm like, oh, hi.
[00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:30.420]   Oh, I too love the New Jersey, you know,
[00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:32.380]   the New Jersey Nets, which is a statement
[00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:34.440]   that no one in their right mind would ever make
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:35.780]   when I was growing up.
[00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:38.820]   So anyway, you'd have to have personal knowledge of somebody.
[00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:40.540]   So anyway, to come back, let's,
[00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:43.900]   if you understand how games are structured,
[00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:48.100]   you can start to realize that there's huge gaps
[00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:51.700]   and huge holes in a lot of the thinking behind all of it.
[00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:54.020]   And if you can create the illusion of choice,
[00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:55.220]   I'll play one more if you don't mind.
[00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:56.060]   This is one of my favorite ones.
[00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:57.820]   I do this in class all the time.
[00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:58.820]   Have you seen this before?
[00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:00.140]   - No. - Okay.
[00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:01.340]   May I ask you some questions, please?
[00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:02.780]   - Sure. - Okay, fantastic.
[00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:03.860]   - I'm scared.
[00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:05.700]   - There's, everybody wins, don't worry.
[00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.580]   All right, so could you please?
[00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:08.780]   - I win.
[00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:11.020]   - Could you please pick three fingers
[00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:12.500]   and tell me what they are?
[00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.260]   - Your thumb. - Okay.
[00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.060]   - Your pinky. - Okay.
[00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:18.260]   - And your middle finger. - Okay.
[00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.180]   So could you please pick two fingers?
[00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:24.120]   - Your middle finger and your pinky.
[00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.120]   - Okay, could you please pick one finger?
[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.740]   - I'll go with middle finger.
[00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:31.660]   - Woo-hoo, okay, could you please pick one finger?
[00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:33.380]   - Pinky. - Okay.
[00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:34.340]   Let's play again.
[00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:35.940]   Can you pick one finger, please?
[00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:39.220]   (laughing)
[00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:41.740]   - Your middle finger.
[00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:43.500]   - Okay, can you pick one finger, please?
[00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.100]   - Your thumb.
[00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:46.420]   Yeah, your pinky.
[00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:50.380]   - Okay, now pick two more fingers, please.
[00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:53.700]   - Your middle finger and your ring finger.
[00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:56.180]   - Okay, could you please pick one more finger?
[00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:57.100]   - Damn it.
[00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:59.140]   - So-- - I thought,
[00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:00.820]   and hence the illusion of choice.
[00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:02.260]   - It's the illusion of choice.
[00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.760]   If I'm asking the questions,
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:07.060]   provided I ask the right questions,
[00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:09.260]   there can be no correct answer.
[00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.180]   Doesn't mean that, I mean, ultimately,
[00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:12.620]   if that's what you wanted,
[00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:14.500]   let's say, like, I thought I was guiding you
[00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:15.340]   to something I wanted,
[00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:17.220]   and it turns out that was the outcome you wanted.
[00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:19.180]   Well, now I'm gonna ask the wrong questions.
[00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:20.380]   I might not get what I wanted, so--
[00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:22.580]   - Oh, by the way, sorry to interrupt.
[00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:25.340]   For people that might be just listening to this,
[00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:28.460]   that no matter what trajectory we took
[00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:30.700]   through that decision tree that Ryan was presenting,
[00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:32.420]   it was always ending up with the middle finger,
[00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:34.180]   ironically enough.
[00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:35.220]   - I was surprised.
[00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:38.380]   - All of us were surprised.
[00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:39.660]   And we're both winners.
[00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:41.340]   - Yeah, we all, everyone was.
[00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:42.700]   - I felt like a winner.
[00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:44.300]   - All right, so now I'm gonna,
[00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:47.140]   now I'll ask some different questions, if you don't mind.
[00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:49.340]   Can you please pick two fingers to put down?
[00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:53.740]   - Your middle finger and your pinky.
[00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:54.580]   Sorry, sorry.
[00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:55.740]   - Oh, that's so awkward.
[00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:57.640]   That's like the worst finger positions.
[00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:59.300]   Okay, can you please pick, oh, wait a minute.
[00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:00.980]   That's, ow, hold on.
[00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:01.820]   - Yeah.
[00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:04.620]   - Well, what if you pick two other fingers to put down?
[00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:06.860]   - Your thumb and your pinky.
[00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:07.900]   - Okay, my thumb and my pinky.
[00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:10.100]   Can you please pick two fingers to put down?
[00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:12.780]   - Well--
[00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:14.060]   - Whatever two you like.
[00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:16.980]   - Okay, your middle finger and your pointy finger.
[00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:19.980]   - Ah, okay, can you pick two fingers to put down?
[00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:21.060]   - What's the name, is index finger.
[00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:21.900]   - Index finger.
[00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:22.740]   - Why did I call it the pointy finger?
[00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:24.500]   - It's the pointy one, that's the one we usually point.
[00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:26.500]   It's weird to point with your ring finger.
[00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:28.260]   - Sorry, what do--
[00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:29.760]   - Two more to put down, please.
[00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:32.860]   - The middle finger and the ring finger.
[00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:34.700]   - Ah, man.
[00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:38.100]   What if you pick my ring finger and my index finger?
[00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:38.940]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:40.540]   - Aha, woo-hoo, I win.
[00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:42.300]   So even though I'm asking the questions,
[00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:45.240]   it's not impossible that I arrive at a good outcome for me,
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.060]   but it's no longer guaranteed.
[00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:49.740]   I went from a situation where I literally can't lose.
[00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:51.660]   - Yeah, it's pretty low probability.
[00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:53.260]   - Right, super low probability.
[00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.020]   And the second you realize what I'm doing,
[00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:56.340]   you would never let me win
[00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:58.180]   because the ball's truly in your court.
[00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:01.700]   So I guess that's kind of what I'm fundamentally trying
[00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:03.900]   to put into play almost all the time.
[00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:05.860]   Can I ask the right set of questions?
[00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:09.580]   Can I develop the ability skills-wise,
[00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:11.980]   understanding-wise, and then discipline-wise,
[00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:14.460]   and then have the courage and the constitution
[00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:17.640]   and the discipline necessary, the patience necessary
[00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:22.020]   to ask the proper questions and wait for the proper answers?
[00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:27.020]   And if I can, assuming the perfect world,
[00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:29.140]   I win, period.
[00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:30.940]   Does that make sense?
[00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:32.060]   - Yeah, that totally makes sense.
[00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:33.740]   So I don't know if you know
[00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:36.780]   sort of the more mathematical discipline of game theory.
[00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:39.140]   There's something called mechanism design.
[00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:43.860]   So game theory is this field where you model
[00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:46.220]   some kind of interaction between human beings.
[00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:48.140]   You can model grappling that way.
[00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:52.100]   You can model nuclear conflict between nations that way.
[00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:56.100]   And you set up a set of rules and incentives
[00:12:56.100 --> 00:13:01.100]   and then use math to predict what is the likely outcome
[00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:04.980]   depending over time based on the interaction
[00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:06.260]   given those rules.
[00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:11.260]   Mechanism design is the design of games.
[00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:15.980]   So like the design of systems that are likely
[00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:18.540]   to lead to a certain outcome.
[00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:23.540]   And so what you're suggesting is you want to create,
[00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:27.660]   you want to discover systems whose decision tree,
[00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:29.620]   all the possible things that could happen,
[00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:32.540]   feel like there's choice being made,
[00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:37.540]   but ultimately one of the parties doesn't have any choice
[00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:39.820]   in what the actual final outcome is.
[00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:43.700]   You're making them feel like they're playing a game too.
[00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:46.660]   So it's not like you don't feel trapped.
[00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:47.500]   It's kind of like-
[00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:50.860]   - Well, the best traps, you don't look very threatening.
[00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:52.820]   So I'm like, oh, I'll walk over there.
[00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:56.420]   I guess that's kind of an interesting thing.
[00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:58.820]   If a lion, when does a lion roar?
[00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:01.580]   It's an interesting thing when you watch like lions hunting,
[00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:03.660]   don't roar when they hunt.
[00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:06.180]   They want to move you back if they do stuff like that.
[00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:08.300]   When they actually want to come and get you,
[00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:09.320]   they're pretty slinky.
[00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:12.260]   It's like water covered, it's like furry water.
[00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:15.100]   And I guess like when you keep that in mind,
[00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:19.060]   it's funny how, like for us, a hobby actually,
[00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:21.100]   a brilliant guy, like one of my MMA coaches
[00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:23.860]   and the head coach at TriStar, he brought this up one time,
[00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:25.140]   I thought it was a really salient point.
[00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:27.420]   Said, let's say we have a million person bracket,
[00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:28.940]   it was impossibly huge.
[00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:31.900]   Like Frank Dukes winning the Kumite level, huge bracket.
[00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:35.020]   And he claimed to knock out like 250 consecutive people.
[00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:38.220]   And you're like, that is all of Hong Kong,
[00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:40.420]   was in that thing and everyone kept their mouth shut.
[00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:41.780]   But anyway, that's pretty cool.
[00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:45.420]   But to come back, a little improbable, but pretty cool.
[00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:48.060]   So let's say for instance, like there's no cheating going on,
[00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:50.500]   no cheating going on and we're flipping coins, right?
[00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:54.620]   Someone is gonna have an unbroken string of victory
[00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:58.020]   through that bracket, which is pretty insane.
[00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:01.340]   How many consecutive like toss ups this person won.
[00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:04.120]   And then at the end of it all,
[00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:07.540]   imagine we like aliens show up and we go,
[00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:09.940]   hey, they wanna flip a coin for whether or not Earth,
[00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:12.700]   whether or not Earth gets to continue.
[00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:15.120]   They'll be like, oh, I'll do it.
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:16.940]   I'm good at this.
[00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:20.180]   That will be tempting as a person to do.
[00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:21.940]   You're like, I'm a lucky guy.
[00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:23.300]   Are you sure?
[00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:24.740]   Maybe, I mean, maybe effectively you are,
[00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:26.380]   we could argue that effectively you're incredibly lucky.
[00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:28.380]   But basically, is that an actual ability?
[00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:29.540]   Is that like a perk in a video game?
[00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:31.100]   Or is that just this thing that happened?
[00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:34.700]   So anyway, how many times are someone,
[00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:36.940]   you could go through an entire career,
[00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:38.900]   particularly in a fight sport.
[00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:40.420]   Well, let's say you get 15 knockouts
[00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:42.100]   and 15 toss up scenarios.
[00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:43.340]   'Cause you see that happening all the time
[00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:44.700]   in the fight game, a toss up scenario.
[00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:45.740]   It's not like you're mounted on me
[00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:48.300]   and like, and that's not a toss up scenario.
[00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:50.260]   Many, many, many, many, many striking scenarios.
[00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:51.100]   A lot of grappling ones,
[00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:54.020]   but tons of striking scenarios are dead toss ups.
[00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:56.500]   And somebody wins by knockout.
[00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:57.500]   They win five times in a row.
[00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:58.780]   Then they lose a couple of times in a row.
[00:15:58.780 --> 00:15:59.740]   We go, what happened?
[00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:00.620]   You're like, what do you mean what happened?
[00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:01.780]   They were always flipping the coin.
[00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:04.460]   And then they win five more and they go, ah, back on track.
[00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:05.300]   Can you imagine that?
[00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:06.120]   You're flipping a coin.
[00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:07.500]   I'm like, heads, heads, heads, heads, tails.
[00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:08.460]   What?
[00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:09.740]   Tails, tails, heads again.
[00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:10.700]   Oh man, I'm back on it.
[00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:11.820]   I'm flipping good now.
[00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:13.580]   That's basically what's going on.
[00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:15.180]   I think the vast majority of the time.
[00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:18.120]   And then humanity's tendency to see a sign
[00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:21.620]   in almost anything, you know, starts to present itself.
[00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:23.340]   And then we build a narrative in our mind
[00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:26.180]   to convince ourselves that we're in some sort of control.
[00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:28.580]   When in reality, I was in a marginal situation
[00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:30.780]   at best the whole time.
[00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:32.020]   - Yeah, without having much control,
[00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:33.940]   without having a deep understanding of the system,
[00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:35.780]   the same story is told in the stock market.
[00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:38.940]   With many of the human, these distributed human systems,
[00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:41.660]   we start telling narratives and start seeing patterns
[00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:44.060]   without understanding actually the system
[00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:45.420]   that's generating these patterns.
[00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:47.860]   - So if we can see the system, that's incredibly valuable.
[00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:49.200]   But then you go, well, what system
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:50.660]   is above all of the systems?
[00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:52.180]   I guess maybe physics, maybe,
[00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:53.680]   like game theory explains these things,
[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:56.320]   but like, I guess what aspects of the system
[00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:59.140]   can I put my hands on that I can touch and understand?
[00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:00.760]   And what am I missing?
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:02.860]   What's going on in the world all around me
[00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:06.760]   to continue to lean on Dune that I don't have,
[00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:08.800]   that I don't, you know, you talk to a blind person
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:10.620]   about the world, about sight,
[00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:12.740]   and talk to someone that doesn't have everyone,
[00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:15.100]   who's got coronavirus now, so no one can taste or smell.
[00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:16.460]   They're like, this is delicious.
[00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:18.300]   I'm like, is it?
[00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:22.580]   So anyway, you know, again, what senses am I missing
[00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:24.020]   or what understanding am I missing
[00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:27.620]   that's preventing me from seeing the dots connect
[00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:29.280]   in the world all around me?
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:32.020]   And I think sometimes if we, oftentimes,
[00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:34.020]   at least personally, I've screwed this up a lot.
[00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:36.180]   I'm so nose deep in the trench
[00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:37.260]   of trying to understand what I'm doing
[00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.860]   that I can't take a step back and realize, you know,
[00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:42.900]   that I'm in a forest, not just head-butting a tree.
[00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:44.500]   And I may be doing both.
[00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:45.920]   Two things should be true at once.
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:48.540]   But so I would say when it comes to strategy,
[00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:50.820]   trying to understand that, but then also you go,
[00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:53.300]   well, okay, well, how can, that sounds cool,
[00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:54.940]   but how can you actually do that?
[00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:56.780]   And then I'd say that's a really good question
[00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:58.020]   because if I imagine, I say, man,
[00:17:58.020 --> 00:17:59.380]   I should fight like Stephen Thompson.
[00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:00.540]   I should fight like Wonder Boy.
[00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:01.940]   He's like, good idea, go do that.
[00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:05.740]   I'm like, not the guy.
[00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:07.860]   I would fight like Khabib Nurmagomedov if I could.
[00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:09.140]   You know, it seems to work.
[00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:12.200]   So anyway, you go, well, what if I could develop,
[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:14.580]   what if I could take my time developing skills
[00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:17.480]   so that when these strategies become apparent,
[00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:19.720]   they are executable to you.
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:22.320]   You actually have the ability to like,
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:24.600]   in or to, again, to be the person in the arena,
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:26.000]   be the person required,
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.400]   whereas there's plenty of great ideas,
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:29.920]   like dunking a basketball is a fantastic idea.
[00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:32.500]   Alas, for me, unless there's a small trampoline nearby,
[00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:33.640]   I'm not the guy.
[00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:35.800]   But that doesn't make it any less good of an idea.
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:38.040]   I just don't, I haven't developed the ability
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.300]   or I lack the ability.
[00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:41.160]   So anyway, I think a lot of times,
[00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:42.700]   at least when I watch people in fighting,
[00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:45.520]   I'll use an example, we're so concerned
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:48.800]   with trying to win early on rather than develop skills
[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:50.960]   that I'm going like, well, what's the best way to fight
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:52.480]   with my current set of skills?
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:55.220]   And usually the path forward is like the barbarian route.
[00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:57.840]   Like the, you put on the one ring,
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:59.800]   take the damage you need to take to hit that guy.
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:01.200]   And that was something I realized very early on
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:02.120]   in my MMA career was like,
[00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:04.280]   I'm not that good at striking at that time.
[00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:05.560]   Not a world-class striker now,
[00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:07.120]   but I'm way better at striking
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:08.160]   than I'm given any credit for
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.920]   because it helps people sleep at night, I think.
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:11.240]   But I'm serious.
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:12.940]   But-- - Yeah, yeah.
[00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:15.340]   You're always introduced as like this master,
[00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:17.380]   like master grappler.
[00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:18.660]   - And I'm like, that's nice of them to say that.
[00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:19.940]   Maybe I'm not that good at grappling.
[00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:20.900]   We haven't even seen that.
[00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:22.340]   And, but the funny thing is where I'm like,
[00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:23.860]   just 'cause people almost go like, well, Lex,
[00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:25.400]   like, so you're really good at this,
[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:26.980]   but you gotta understand like, we're equal, man.
[00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:28.220]   Like I'm good at this other thing.
[00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:29.580]   Maybe you're really good at what you do
[00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:31.140]   and I'm just mediocre at what I do.
[00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:32.380]   That's also possible.
[00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:33.900]   So there's plenty of people that define themselves
[00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:35.500]   as a striker that do that just because
[00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:36.860]   that's for lack of other options.
[00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:37.900]   Not 'cause they're a really good striker.
[00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:38.740]   Or like, I'm a grappler.
[00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:40.640]   I was a grappler as a blue belt.
[00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:41.480]   Not really.
[00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:43.520]   So anyway, I guess to come back,
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:45.120]   if I'm constantly going,
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:47.160]   how can I win with what I've got right now?
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:48.920]   I think oftentimes I never take the time
[00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:50.560]   to develop the skills that I wanna develop.
[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:52.440]   And I also never take the time to develop the strategies
[00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:53.260]   that I wanna develop.
[00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:55.320]   And that has actually been one big blessing
[00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:57.340]   of fighting so infrequently,
[00:19:57.340 --> 00:19:59.720]   which has been really frustrating as a result of injuries
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:01.880]   and time away and some of those people
[00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.320]   being hesitant to get in the game.
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:07.000]   But it gives you so much time to be out of the trenches
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.940]   and focus on developing your abilities
[00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:10.740]   so that now it's almost like developing money.
[00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:13.380]   Like you mentioned, the stock market that you can now put in.
[00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:15.420]   Imagine you told me Bitcoin was a great idea
[00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:17.340]   five years ago when I had eight bucks.
[00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:18.820]   Man, if someone told me Bitcoin was a great idea
[00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:20.940]   five years ago and I had 50K,
[00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:23.460]   I'd be like, oh my God, I'd be sleeping in my bed of money
[00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:26.140]   that I would then set on fire later today just to do it.
[00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:27.980]   - So due to all the injuries,
[00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:29.940]   you've been mining Bitcoin all this time
[00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:31.220]   and now you're a rich man.
[00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:32.380]   - Well, no, actually, somebody told me
[00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:35.620]   I was trying to mine for Bitcoin, actually, like in a cave.
[00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:37.860]   And then I found out recently that mining
[00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:39.660]   is like a figure of speech,
[00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:41.220]   not like a literal thing that you do.
[00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:42.060]   But I mean, in my defense, I would--
[00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:43.820]   - English language is difficult.
[00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:45.220]   - It is, it really is.
[00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:47.460]   - Next time talk to me, I'll explain.
[00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:50.460]   Russian is a rich language.
[00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:52.660]   You should learn Russian.
[00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:53.500]   I'll help you out.
[00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:54.580]   - I believe you, thank you.
[00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:59.580]   - Can you do a whirlwind overview of your career in MMA
[00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:04.100]   leading up to this point with the injuries
[00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:06.380]   and the undefeated record?
[00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:07.700]   And then what's next?
[00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:09.180]   Since we're on the topic.
[00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:12.660]   - Well, I did my first fight as a blue belt
[00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:14.020]   and I've been training for about a year and a half.
[00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:16.420]   I did nine Jiu-Jitsu tournaments in 10 weekends,
[00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:18.280]   or maybe eight Jiu-Jitsu tournaments in 10 weekends
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:22.300]   prior to my first fight in April, 2006.
[00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:23.720]   I got punched in the face a whole bunch.
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:25.460]   I didn't realize it was a professional fight
[00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:27.540]   and found that out like the day beforehand.
[00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:28.940]   That was great.
[00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:29.780]   Thanks, coach.
[00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:32.100]   It was in Atlantic City,
[00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:34.260]   where another place no one ever goes on purpose.
[00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:35.280]   So that wasn't great.
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:39.060]   I got into three, actually three car accidents
[00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:42.140]   in the preceding 36 hours before the fight.
[00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:44.220]   I had my car totaled.
[00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:45.660]   I wasn't driving for any of them.
[00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:47.180]   That was great.
[00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:48.020]   - It was 2006?
[00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:49.220]   - It's 2006, yeah.
[00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:50.300]   - You're a blue belt?
[00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:52.020]   - Yeah, yeah, I've been training for about a year and a half.
[00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:53.220]   - So you're a blue belt.
[00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:55.380]   You're getting, I mean, if you haven't lived,
[00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:57.820]   if you haven't gotten punched in the face in Atlantic City.
[00:21:57.820 --> 00:21:58.660]   - That's true.
[00:21:58.660 --> 00:21:59.500]   I mean, I've--
[00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:00.320]   - So these are--
[00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:02.760]   - I would've loved to have it happen for different reasons.
[00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:03.600]   - Yeah.
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:05.480]   - But yeah, well, what's funny is,
[00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:07.560]   I remember getting punched in the face a bunch,
[00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:09.000]   trying to do inverted guard.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.880]   I won one round, lost two rounds,
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:12.200]   definitely lost the fight.
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:13.960]   - So you went for inverted, sorry to interrupt,
[00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:14.800]   you went for inverted guard?
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:16.680]   Can you tell the story of that fight, just real quick?
[00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:17.520]   - Yeah, sure.
[00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:18.340]   It was three three-minute rounds,
[00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:19.980]   which is not a professional fight length,
[00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:21.720]   although I don't know if professional fight length
[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:22.540]   would've been any better.
[00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:24.360]   It's just more time to get punched.
[00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:26.320]   But I found out partway through,
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:27.680]   I was like, I remember walking back to my corner
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:29.240]   in the first round, I'm like, "Yeah, this guy can't hurt me."
[00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:31.800]   And he's like, "Yeah, my corner was my friend Tom,
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:32.840]   "and then someone else."
[00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:34.480]   And he's like, "Yeah, I would still encourage you
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:36.400]   "to stop blocking so many punches with your face."
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:37.840]   I'm like, "That's a good idea, Tom, I appreciate that.
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:39.240]   "I'm gonna try that."
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:43.060]   Anyway, I remember, I was not allowed to up-kick,
[00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:43.900]   so I'm like, "Great."
[00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:46.920]   I had no martial arts skills, really, at all,
[00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:48.480]   but if I had anything at all, it was jiu-jitsu.
[00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:50.480]   It was very, very little jiu-jitsu,
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:53.160]   but definitely no wrestling, definitely no striking.
[00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:55.200]   I was basically a magnet for punches.
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:58.440]   - So that was your time, roughnecking out
[00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:01.440]   in Atlantic City, as we all do once in a while.
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:03.040]   Can we fast forward to when you're actually
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:05.040]   dominating the world as a black belt?
[00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:05.880]   - Well, actually, it's funny,
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:07.160]   'cause I took the little bit of money that they're like,
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:08.160]   "Hey, we're paying him."
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:09.000]   I'm like, "Really?"
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:09.840]   Okay, well, I took that money--
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:12.040]   - It's like Bukowski stories with Ryan Hall.
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:13.520]   - Well, then I went to the casino,
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:14.960]   I went to whatever, like the Tropicana
[00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:16.400]   that was right there, the casino,
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:17.360]   'cause that was a boardwalk hall.
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:18.400]   I'm like, "You know what, man?
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:20.840]   "This has been a not great evening.
[00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:23.400]   "I'm gonna win it back, this is gonna be great."
[00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:26.040]   15 minutes later, they had all the money
[00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:27.920]   that I had from the fight was gone.
[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:30.720]   I just remember walking out of the casino super pissed.
[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:32.480]   And I don't know what I was thinking.
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:33.720]   I'm not good at gambling.
[00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:35.520]   This was not gonna make my night better.
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:36.440]   I just thought that there was gonna be
[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:37.800]   some sort of cosmic balancing,
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:39.200]   and maybe it was the cosmic balancing
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:40.040]   all at once where things had done in the past.
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:43.680]   - Longer term, though, the balancing.
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:45.080]   - We'll see, I hope so.
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:45.920]   But to come--
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:47.040]   - We're all dead in the end, though.
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:49.360]   - That is true, time will get us all, yeah.
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:51.760]   Well, so that was the first one,
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:54.560]   and that was when I realized I'm terrible at MMA,
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:56.600]   but I like it, I should just stop this
[00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:58.680]   until I one day learn how to actually grapple,
[00:23:58.680 --> 00:23:59.760]   much less learn how to fight.
[00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:01.240]   But I remember there's this guy named Dave Kaplan,
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:03.160]   who's the reason my ears are all messed up,
[00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:04.560]   who was on "The Ultimate Fighter"
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:06.720]   and got punched in the face and knocked out by Tom Lawler,
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:09.160]   who I'll always appreciate for doing that.
[00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:10.680]   But anyway--
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:11.840]   - Dave or Tom.
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:13.360]   - I appreciate Tom, I appreciate Dave, too.
[00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:14.200]   Dave was great.
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:15.960]   Dave was just a huge bully and used to,
[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:17.520]   rather not completely unmercifully,
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:19.800]   but relatively unmercifully beat the crap out of me.
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:21.480]   And anyway--
[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:22.680]   - The ears look good, so.
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:23.520]   - Appreciate that.
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:25.200]   I tell people it's a tumor that I got,
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:27.880]   and if they want in on a class action lawsuit with AT&T,
[00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:31.200]   they should send me an email.
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:32.040]   But anyway--
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:34.720]   - You're very financially savvy, very good.
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:36.120]   - No, I just give the impression.
[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:37.560]   Dave basically said, "Hey, don't worry, man,
[00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:39.540]   "you're never gonna be good at MMA,
[00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:41.120]   "and you're never gonna be good at grappling either,
[00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:42.580]   "but even if you are good at grappling,"
[00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:45.480]   which, in my opinion, you will never be,
[00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:46.680]   you will never be good at fighting.
[00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:50.200]   And I said, "Dave, if I do nothing else in my life,
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:52.760]   "I'm gonna keep training until I can make you pay for that."
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:54.640]   And now that I can make him pay for that really easily,
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:55.640]   he doesn't train anymore.
[00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:56.880]   But I love Dave, Dave's awesome.
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:58.000]   He actually won the singing beat.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.080]   What an interesting dude, super interesting guy.
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:00.920]   But anyway--
[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:01.760]   - Is he a good guy?
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:03.760]   - No, no, no, Virginia, speaks a couple languages,
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:06.820]   super interesting guy, shockingly good at Jeopardy too.
[00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:08.680]   Not that I'm any good,
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:09.840]   but still shockingly good at Jeopardy.
[00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:11.640]   So anyway, years later, met Faraz Zahabi,
[00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:13.800]   actually, John Danaher, I met John Danaher,
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:15.640]   and he put me in touch with Faraz Zahabi.
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:17.160]   I started training at TriStar,
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:18.960]   immediately loved working with Faraz
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:20.880]   and learning under Faraz, started training at TriStar,
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:24.040]   and I did my first real professional MMA fight
[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:25.720]   as someone that actually does,
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:28.080]   had practiced a little bit prior,
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:30.240]   in I think August, 2012.
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:34.880]   And that was against a guy, he was four and five at the time,
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:36.760]   so had some experience,
[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:38.800]   good kind of like first go for me, honestly.
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:40.960]   And I won that fight by TKO.
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:42.840]   And then it was a little bit of a time off,
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:43.680]   and then I did another fight
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:45.940]   against a tough guy named Magid Hamo.
[00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:47.080]   He was five and two at the time,
[00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:48.160]   I think he was three and I was amateur.
[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:50.600]   So he had a good little bit of fighting experience.
[00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:53.180]   Won that one in the first round of Iron Weird Naked Choke.
[00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:56.400]   And then started to experience difficulty
[00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:58.540]   getting fights at that point.
[00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:00.800]   - Were you continuously introduced
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:04.600]   as like the master of grappling, the submission?
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:05.880]   - At least that was my thing.
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:06.720]   I don't know if I was--
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:08.760]   - Is that was the source of the fear for people?
[00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:10.040]   - I think so, because I mean,
[00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:12.760]   I definitely wasn't much at striking at that point.
[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:14.640]   I definitely am a lot,
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:15.960]   I like to think I'm pretty hard to hurt,
[00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:17.200]   although I try not to lean on that.
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:19.280]   And I played baseball for like 16 years,
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:20.280]   so I can hit things pretty hard.
[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:22.160]   I just wasn't able to,
[00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:24.520]   I recognized pretty early on that I had no idea
[00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:26.140]   how to actually hit things hard
[00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:28.320]   without becoming hitable myself.
[00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:30.200]   So I think that's kind of the big thing
[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:31.160]   is a lot of times,
[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:33.380]   like we almost were mentioning before,
[00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:36.680]   if you try to go and get people too early,
[00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:38.740]   you can hit them if they're not that good,
[00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:40.260]   but you're going to get hit yourself.
[00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:42.360]   So you're making, you're basically making a wager,
[00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:44.240]   you're making a trade of your own life
[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:45.480]   for the ability to hit them.
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:47.280]   When you watch guys like Israel Adesanya,
[00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:49.600]   Floyd Mayweather, Steven Thompson,
[00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:51.800]   Conor McGregor when he's fighting really well,
[00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:53.040]   it's not a trade.
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:55.440]   They're not, you're hitting them and they're hitting you.
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:56.880]   It's, they're hitting you,
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:59.320]   but it takes years and years and years and years
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:00.240]   to be able to learn how to do that.
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:01.800]   Tan Lee is another great example of that.
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:03.000]   And you know, my closest training partner,
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.160]   one of my best friends,
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:06.960]   and currently now a one champion,
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:08.600]   one championship in Asia,
[00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:10.120]   the champion of the featherweight,
[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:12.360]   or I guess lightweight featherweight,
[00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:14.160]   155 over there now.
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:16.080]   And he recently defeated Martin Wynn
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:17.280]   in a really great fight,
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:19.560]   and Tan knocked him out, long-time champion.
[00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:21.160]   And Tan doesn't let you hit him.
[00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:22.280]   He doesn't let you touch him.
[00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:25.200]   I feel so fortunate to have met guys like Steven and Tan
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:27.320]   to go early on in career and go,
[00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:30.000]   "Holy moly, I can't even,
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:30.840]   it's not even like,
[00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:32.240]   oh, you'll let me walk over and find you."
[00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:33.280]   It's like fighting a ghost
[00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:34.760]   that periodically shows up with a hammer
[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:36.200]   and smokes you in the melon
[00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:38.000]   and then disappears into the ether again.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.160]   - So the way they approach the fighting game is thinking,
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:42.080]   how can I attack without being hit?
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:44.200]   So every, every strategy,
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:46.640]   every idea you have about what you're going to do
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:49.720]   has to do with like that,
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:52.440]   minimizing the return. - The return.
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:53.280]   Absolutely.
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:54.600]   I mean, that's what all good fighting is done.
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:55.480]   All poor fighting,
[00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:56.800]   if throughout the course of history,
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:58.440]   most generals, whatever I saw or read,
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:01.840]   or they did battles by attrition.
[00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:04.680]   It's like, yeah, man, I've got 150 guys, you've got 50.
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:06.760]   Like, yeah, if 60 of my guys die killing your 50,
[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:08.120]   like, that's great for me.
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:10.960]   But that's not so great for the 60 guys that died.
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:12.000]   I hope it's worth it.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.480]   So when you realize that not only,
[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:16.400]   you're not just Kobe Bryant and you're Phil Jackson too,
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:17.660]   you got to do everything.
[00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:21.000]   If you've got to run across the beach at Normandy,
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.720]   so be it, but that better be,
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:24.480]   you should have, make sure we thought this through.
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:26.120]   And there's like, hey, there's no way we can like,
[00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:27.920]   you know, walk around the side, huh?
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:30.000]   Because oftentimes there is,
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.200]   and I think a lot of times there's a lot of incentives
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:34.800]   in professional fighting too, for people to want to do that.
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:36.240]   And we come up with all sorts of,
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:38.440]   well, I'm trying to be exciting.
[00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:39.280]   Are you?
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:40.280]   Is that really what you came here to do?
[00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:41.440]   'Cause I came here to win.
[00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:44.080]   And I think that anyone that's really successful
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:44.920]   came there to win.
[00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:46.560]   And if it ends up being exciting, well, that's fantastic.
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:48.240]   I hope that people enjoy watching something
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:50.440]   and that's great, but that's a qualitative assessment.
[00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:53.440]   Anyway, you know, you want to also be able to,
[00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:55.360]   you know, live the rest of your life.
[00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:56.280]   I think it's easy.
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:57.560]   You know, I'll use Meldrick Taylor.
[00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:58.520]   I'm a big boxing fan.
[00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:00.800]   Meldrick Taylor was an excellent fighter,
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:05.040]   came this close to a world title and was stopped with like,
[00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:07.440]   he was in a fight that he was winning with seconds remaining,
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:08.640]   literally seconds remaining.
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:10.160]   And they probably could have just let it go
[00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:11.320]   and he would have been world champion.
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:12.200]   And it was brutal.
[00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:13.640]   If you ever watched legendary nights,
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:16.120]   like a HBO boxing show, it's great.
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:17.960]   But it's heartbreaking.
[00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:18.880]   It's absolutely heartbreaking.
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:21.240]   And also like the beating that he absorbed in that fight
[00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:22.960]   changed him for the rest of his life.
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:25.520]   And also, you know, don't think he'd never been hit before,
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:26.800]   but it was one of those where you go,
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:30.000]   it's all fun and games until you can't remember your name
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.800]   at age 44 years old.
[00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:35.040]   And I didn't come here, what did Patton say?
[00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:37.200]   Nobody wins a war by dying for his country.
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:39.240]   You make the other poor bastard die for his.
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:42.480]   And I think that that's kind of what we're shooting for.
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:46.800]   And, you know, the lionization of absorbing damage
[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:48.280]   and that not being a big deal.
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:49.200]   Like you hear that all the time.
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:52.000]   So-and-so can take shots that would put a lesser fighter
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:52.840]   down.
[00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:54.760]   What does that even mean?
[00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:56.200]   You know, like, so let me get this straight.
[00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:59.040]   Your ability to absorb damage is a part of you.
[00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:00.240]   I mean, I guess that, don't get me wrong,
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:03.120]   that is an attribute that's nice to have if you need it.
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:04.960]   But there's plenty of people that actually have really
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:08.880]   porous defense that are just very, very difficult to hurt
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:10.160]   for whatever reason.
[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:12.440]   - That's a fascinating fighter's perspective on the thing.
[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:17.440]   I mean, the story that is inspiring,
[00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:22.360]   and I know it goes against the artistry of fighting,
[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:27.240]   is when you have taken the damage to still rise up
[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:29.160]   and be able to defeat the opponent.
[00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:34.160]   So it's, but that's a flip side of a basically you failing
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:38.600]   to defend yourself properly, right?
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:39.440]   - I agree.
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:40.920]   But let's say for, I think it's a triumph,
[00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:42.600]   that's a triumph of humanity.
[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:44.120]   That's a triumph, that's amazing.
[00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:46.460]   To witness such a thing is unbelievable.
[00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:50.280]   But you still go, this is, there is a cost here.
[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:53.120]   It's like I've been fortunate enough to spend some time
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:55.720]   working with the military, and I've been like around
[00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:57.960]   and read Medal of Honor citations, they're unbelievable.
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:00.920]   Like you read the story and you're like, it'll floor you.
[00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:02.720]   - But it's still a cost, and you don't wanna be paying
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:03.840]   that cost all along.
[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:06.320]   - And most of the time, the cost was everything.
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:08.960]   And then sometimes you go, hey, yeah, the value here,
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:10.320]   it's worth everything.
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:13.080]   It's like, I defend your family, defend your country
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:14.760]   under certain circumstances, and at that point,
[00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:16.080]   it's extension of your family.
[00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:17.500]   You're like, hey, this is worth it.
[00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:20.200]   To casually throw your life away or throw your health away,
[00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:22.960]   it's foolish, there's nothing great about that.
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:26.440]   And like you said, it's still an amazing thing to see, but.
[00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:29.600]   - But it's also amazing to see you not take damages
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:32.360]   to Floyd Mayweather, it's the artistry of not being hit.
[00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:34.300]   - And I wonder if maybe that's why people don't resonate
[00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:35.140]   with Floyd as much.
[00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:37.280]   'Cause obviously Muhammad Ali was such a time and place,
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:38.920]   a great man for so many different reasons,
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:40.600]   although it was funny to remember,
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:42.120]   there were times when he wasn't very popular.
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:44.280]   We love him now because of time of context,
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:46.400]   time to move away from some of the nonsense
[00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:47.380]   he had to deal with.
[00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:50.000]   But we got to see him struggle.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.040]   And also he had unbelievable sacrifice,
[00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:55.920]   both in and out of the ring, that we all got to witness.
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:58.080]   We've never really seen Floyd struggle like that.
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:00.040]   And granted, obviously, Floyd isn't like a civil rights
[00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:02.400]   figure like Muhammad Ali was, it's a different time,
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:03.640]   different place, and he's a different man.
[00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:07.480]   But basically, I wonder if part of the thing that made us,
[00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:09.760]   that made everyone think of Muhammad Ali as the greatest,
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:11.520]   in addition to, of course, the unbelievable things
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:15.120]   that he did out in the world, and the stands that he made,
[00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:17.280]   we saw him struggle in the ring.
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:19.400]   It's almost, it's humanizing.
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:21.800]   It's weird when people-- - You connect with the person.
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:25.040]   - People respect Khabib, but again, we saw GSP lose,
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:26.760]   and GSP came back stronger.
[00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:30.400]   Khabib is amazing, but I wonder how people feel
[00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:32.000]   about him long-term, not like they won't think of him
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.960]   as amazing and great, and he's been a respectable person
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:39.960]   and champion, but the time, he hasn't had to fall,
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:41.480]   if that makes sense.
[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:46.480]   - And also coupled with Ali had a way of being poetic
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:50.000]   about sort of the way he was in the ring,
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.120]   sort of being able to explain the artistry that he,
[00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:54.160]   I mean, there's like joking as being playful,
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:58.440]   but really he was able to describe the flow
[00:32:58.440 --> 00:32:59.720]   like a butterfly's thing like a bee.
[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:03.120]   Like he was able to actually talk about his strategy
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:07.320]   without crossing that line into the flow he made,
[00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:09.600]   whether when you're just talking about money
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:11.280]   and just talking shit.
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:12.100]   - That's true.
[00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:14.720]   - Actually, Conor McGregor, when he's not talking shit,
[00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:17.800]   is pretty good at like talking about the art of the martial.
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:19.480]   - Like the first book.
[00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:22.360]   - And I wish Khabib did the same.
[00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:27.360]   Actually, from like the Satya brothers, there's a few,
[00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:30.160]   there's a culture of like being poetic
[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:35.160]   about like being scholars and also bards or whatever,
[00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:37.840]   the poets of the game.
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:41.480]   And Khabib is more like just simple
[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:44.640]   and he lets his actions speak, which is great too.
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:45.760]   - It's poeting in its own way.
[00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:48.880]   - Yeah, it's great, but it's nice when you can tell stories.
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:53.280]   And that's probably why Ali was the great.
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:57.440]   Catch me up to, you went to three fights, I think,
[00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:01.680]   undefeated, BJ Penn, we talked about last time
[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:06.680]   you defeated BJ Penn, that's an incredible accomplishment,
[00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:09.120]   but you fought a lot of really tough guys.
[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:12.280]   When was your last fight?
[00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:14.920]   And then catch me up with the injuries.
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:17.120]   A lot of people kept more and more and more
[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:20.320]   or unwilling to fight you.
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:22.880]   - Yeah, that was why I was out for two years
[00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:25.680]   following the Gray Manard fight between,
[00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:27.520]   fighting Gray and BJ.
[00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:28.720]   And the Gray Manard fight was actually
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:31.440]   one I'm really proud of because Gray was very tough.
[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:33.720]   He's very big, very strong, very experienced.
[00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:35.760]   I had only five fights at the time
[00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:38.080]   and I didn't have a lot of skills.
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:40.580]   I don't get to fight Gray with what I have today.
[00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:43.760]   I had to fight Gray with what I had in December, 2016.
[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:46.120]   And it really took a lot of discipline,
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:48.360]   a lot of focus, a lot of challenge,
[00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:50.000]   to stay the course, to do what I needed to do
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.800]   in that fight and to win in ultimately dominating fashion,
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:55.000]   just not in the dominating obvious sense
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.600]   that you see when someone runs across
[00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:58.600]   and just does that to somebody.
[00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:01.040]   But that wasn't on the list for me at that time.
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:03.680]   So that was an interesting one,
[00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:05.720]   but the time away, again, was very frustrating.
[00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:07.320]   That was incredibly difficult for me.
[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:08.280]   - Before that fight.
[00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:09.120]   - After that fight.
[00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:12.080]   Well, 'cause I beat Artem Lobov
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:13.440]   in the final of "The Ultimate Fighter."
[00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:15.360]   And Artem is another guy that's tough,
[00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:17.640]   a lot of experience and gets,
[00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:20.980]   he's a funny guy and he said some things on the internet.
[00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:22.700]   So he gets a lot of heat for that.
[00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:24.900]   But he just knocked out three of my teammates.
[00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:27.960]   And he put a couple of people in a pretty rough shape
[00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:28.800]   at the end of that.
[00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:30.000]   So he was doing well, and that was a tough fight.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.600]   Again, if I got to go back and fight that fight now,
[00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:34.320]   it would be not competitive at all.
[00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:35.720]   I mean, it wasn't competitive at that time,
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:36.960]   but it was, let me rephrase,
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:38.920]   it wasn't close, but it was competitive.
[00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:40.560]   - So you were improving and growing fast.
[00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:42.380]   - Yeah, and it was nice to have time away.
[00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:43.840]   I wish I'd had more time in the ring,
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:45.640]   but again, I'd only been doing MMA
[00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:46.840]   for three years at that time.
[00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:49.440]   - So the improvement from doing what,
[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:54.440]   the Bitcoin mining was overriding the ring rust
[00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:55.980]   - I think so.
[00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:57.740]   I don't really believe in ring rust, if I'm honest.
[00:35:57.740 --> 00:36:01.260]   I can understand why people could feel a certain way,
[00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:03.060]   but if anything, it's almost like you just kind of forget
[00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:04.580]   what competition's like.
[00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:07.140]   And you realize, oh, you feel butterflies
[00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:07.960]   or something like that, and you go,
[00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:08.840]   oh my God, this is different versus,
[00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:10.300]   no, that's just your body getting ready to perform.
[00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:11.620]   It's okay, it's normal.
[00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:13.420]   - How do you not have ring rust?
[00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:17.220]   - I think I try to practice performing no matter what,
[00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:19.060]   like whether it's singing karaoke, I'm not very good,
[00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:21.900]   but anything, you name it, talking in front of people.
[00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:23.860]   - You embrace the butterflies?
[00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:26.420]   - Yeah, it's almost like, I remember my last fight,
[00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:28.300]   I'm just staring at the wall and going like,
[00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:31.540]   huh, I guess I'm gonna fight in a couple minutes.
[00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:34.700]   I mean, of course, we all heard the phrase,
[00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:36.480]   like you can never walk in the same river twice
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:39.980]   because even if the river's the same, you're a different man.
[00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:42.160]   That's, I think it's a really important thing to understand
[00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:44.420]   'cause at various points in my martial arts career,
[00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:47.120]   I've thought, oh man, how should I feel?
[00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:49.220]   I remember when I used to do well in competition,
[00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:50.960]   I would feel, I would think these thoughts,
[00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:53.240]   listen to this song, think about this.
[00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:54.140]   I would feel a certain way,
[00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:55.580]   and then if you don't feel that way,
[00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:57.680]   I would start to become stressed
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:00.540]   because I was self-inflicted versus going,
[00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:01.660]   you'll feel how you feel.
[00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:04.560]   Your job is to show up with what you have on the day,
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:05.580]   do your absolute best.
[00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:06.540]   It's like, I will never quit.
[00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:07.380]   I can be sure of that.
[00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:08.420]   I didn't say I can't be beat.
[00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:09.720]   I can definitely be beat.
[00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:11.660]   I could have lost every single fight that I've ever had,
[00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:14.700]   but I control my effort and I control my attitude,
[00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:18.140]   and that's, I will do my very best to execute my game plan
[00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:19.260]   and the event's not working.
[00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:21.360]   If I have to, I'll put my hands up and walk dead forward.
[00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:22.900]   If I need to, it's somebody,
[00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:24.260]   we hope that that's not where it goes,
[00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:27.140]   but like again, that humanizing moment
[00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:28.900]   where you're shooting for just the inner,
[00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:31.300]   like the inner, you sacrifice the outer
[00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:33.020]   and all you have left is will,
[00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:34.780]   and you hope it doesn't happen,
[00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:36.100]   but if it does, you'll be there,
[00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:37.220]   but I guess to come back,
[00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:40.300]   the extra periods of time in between fights,
[00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:43.860]   I think was valuable because it was deeply challenging.
[00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:46.660]   It was incredibly, it was heartbreaking sometimes,
[00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:47.500]   if I'm honest, man.
[00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:48.500]   It's like, I didn't wanna--
[00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:49.420]   - It's just waiting.
[00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:50.260]   - Oh my God, dude.
[00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:52.100]   - Was there politics involved?
[00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:52.940]   Was there--
[00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:54.340]   - Sometimes, you know, like I,
[00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:59.060]   you know, it's every single time you step into the ring,
[00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:00.100]   nothing's guaranteed.
[00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:04.020]   It's, you could be hurt, you could hurt somebody,
[00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:06.980]   you could win, you could lose, you know,
[00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:08.180]   throwing away, just like I said,
[00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:10.060]   throwing away your health or your life cheaply
[00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:12.280]   makes no sense for anyone,
[00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:14.860]   and you know, having, demonstrating some degree
[00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:17.740]   of temperance is not cowardly either.
[00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:20.780]   I mean, but again, if you wait too long, you have nothing.
[00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:25.180]   So I guess like, I was trying and always being,
[00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:26.140]   I'm always open to fighting
[00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:27.820]   the absolute best people possible.
[00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:30.420]   I'm never turning down fights ever.
[00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:32.220]   You know, if some random jabroni decides
[00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:33.720]   that he wants to fight him, go away.
[00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:34.980]   If I wanted to just fight randoms,
[00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:36.580]   I would just start and stand to the, you know,
[00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:38.380]   on the table at Denny's and start yelling,
[00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:39.420]   and I'm sure I would have, you know,
[00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:41.180]   some people would be willing to indulge me.
[00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:44.620]   But, you know, you wanna fight, you know,
[00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:46.420]   meaningful opponents, challenging opponents,
[00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:48.140]   and I know who and where they are,
[00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:48.980]   and sometimes--
[00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:50.260]   - You did fight in Atlantic City.
[00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:51.100]   - I did.
[00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:52.940]   - So the Denny, but you put the Denny's behind you.
[00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:55.180]   - I did, and you know, I'll be honest,
[00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:56.980]   if there were, if I'd have stood up after that fight,
[00:38:56.980 --> 00:38:58.460]   I don't know if I was in great shape
[00:38:58.460 --> 00:39:00.180]   to expect to win any other fights that evening,
[00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:01.340]   but I could have tried it.
[00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:02.820]   I'm sure there were some takers in the crowd,
[00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:04.100]   particularly after they watched me fight,
[00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:05.300]   they're like, yeah, I'll fight that guy.
[00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:07.580]   - So, okay, so when was the last fight that you had?
[00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:08.760]   - That was Darren Elkins.
[00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:11.260]   That was six months or seven months after the BJ fight,
[00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:12.260]   which was great, 'cause it's, you know,
[00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:13.100]   I love maybe five--
[00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:13.940]   - He's a really tough opponent.
[00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:16.540]   - Very tough opponent, very tough guy, super tough dude,
[00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:19.500]   and that was in July 2019,
[00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:21.580]   and then right when I was about to fight.
[00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:24.460]   - You were ready to fight regularly after that.
[00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:25.300]   - Yeah.
[00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:26.820]   - You were trying to fight.
[00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:29.100]   - Yeah, and we got Ricardo Lamas, so no one else,
[00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:31.660]   none of the, I was ranked in the top 15 at that point,
[00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:34.260]   and then people didn't wanna fight.
[00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:35.860]   We were struggling to find an opponent,
[00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:37.580]   and then Ricardo Lamas, a great, you know,
[00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:39.660]   former title challenger, you know, MMA,
[00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:41.900]   you know, really great history in MMA, recently retired,
[00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:45.820]   but we were supposed to fight in, I think, May, March,
[00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:49.180]   March, May of 2020, and then coronavirus happened,
[00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:51.740]   and so that scrapped the whole show, you know,
[00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:52.940]   training, we were just scrambling
[00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:55.900]   to try to keep the gym alive and take care,
[00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:58.020]   you know, I have five or six full, five, six, I think,
[00:39:58.020 --> 00:40:00.100]   five full-time employees that I, you know,
[00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:01.740]   that are my responsibility, I have to,
[00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:03.260]   their livelihood is in my hands,
[00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:07.580]   and it'd be irresponsible of me to not take that seriously.
[00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:10.500]   So anyway, we were able to navigate through that time,
[00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:13.540]   and then we were able to reschedule the Lamas fight,
[00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:15.860]   and that was in August of last year,
[00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:19.860]   and I got a medical, like, flag, like, oh, hey,
[00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:21.980]   like, you have, like, a medical condition
[00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:24.020]   that we need to look into,
[00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:25.140]   when I got pulled from the fight,
[00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:27.100]   and I immediately was concerned,
[00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:28.780]   because, of course, any serious medical condition,
[00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:30.260]   you wanna go, oh, man, well,
[00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:31.940]   I guess I would like to look at that.
[00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:34.140]   Yeah, it turns out it was a giant false positive,
[00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:36.300]   and, you know, we find that out, you know,
[00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:38.660]   all of five weeks later, and you go,
[00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:39.500]   you gotta be kidding me.
[00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:40.340]   - That's frustrating.
[00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:42.100]   - And then we're still waiting for our fight,
[00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:43.460]   waiting for a fight, waiting for a fight,
[00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:46.140]   waiting for a fight, people won't sign up,
[00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:47.900]   asked for a number of different opponents,
[00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:50.020]   basically said, hey, I'm willing to fight anybody
[00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:51.820]   that's tough and moving forward.
[00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:56.500]   Finally got a, you know, a great opponent in Danny Gay
[00:40:56.500 --> 00:41:01.780]   for, I guess it would have been this March.
[00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:04.180]   And then I was training in January,
[00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:05.500]   working on some stuff.
[00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:09.180]   I was out training with Raymond Daniels in California.
[00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:11.540]   Raymond's amazing, unbelievable, you know,
[00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:13.460]   kickboxing, karate style kickboxer,
[00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:15.460]   fantastic martial artist, great teacher,
[00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:16.820]   great training partner and good friend.
[00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:19.540]   And, you know, just really bad luck, you know,
[00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:21.820]   kind of a fall in the middle of training.
[00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:25.100]   And I tore my hip flexor halfway off of my femur.
[00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:27.420]   So that wasn't great.
[00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:29.340]   And you go like, man, right at the time where you're like,
[00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:31.540]   oh man, all right, finally moving forward, you know,
[00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:32.700]   having the opportunity to fight.
[00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:33.940]   Dan's a really tough guy.
[00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:35.020]   You know, you have to fight well
[00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:36.580]   if you wanna have a good chance to do well with him.
[00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:38.220]   If you don't fight well, it's gonna be a rough night.
[00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:39.540]   I'm like, that's exactly what I signed up for.
[00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:40.380]   That's what we want with BJ,
[00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:43.340]   that's what we want with Elkins, that was great.
[00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:45.100]   And then the universe goes, hey man, I hear you,
[00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:46.220]   but there's also this.
[00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:48.780]   So anyway, fortunately it's healing up
[00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:50.100]   and then hopefully-
[00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:50.940]   - When do you think you-
[00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:52.740]   - From May, I think.
[00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:54.060]   - May this year?
[00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:55.460]   - May of this year.
[00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:58.660]   Yeah, so it's been about five weeks since the injury.
[00:41:58.660 --> 00:42:00.140]   - You'd be able to heal up, you think?
[00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:01.780]   - Yeah, I think it'll be okay by then.
[00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:03.220]   Like, I don't need a big camp at this point.
[00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:05.060]   I've had years of camp.
[00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:08.020]   Not gonna curtail my drinking or anything like that,
[00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:09.500]   obviously, you know, come on, man.
[00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:10.500]   Life is meant to be lived.
[00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:14.620]   And, you know, so it's, you know, I'm in good shape.
[00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:15.780]   I'm always training.
[00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:17.740]   I'm trying to do my best to train around the injury
[00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:18.940]   to the extent that I can right now
[00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:21.500]   without hurting myself long-term.
[00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:23.900]   - So is there a particular opponents you're thinking about?
[00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:25.300]   - Yeah, anybody forward?
[00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:27.420]   You know, I mean, I tried to, I asked,
[00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:28.700]   I asked the second that I got hurt,
[00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:30.300]   I sent a message to Dan and I said, hey man,
[00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:33.060]   like, I just wanted you to be the first person to know.
[00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:36.580]   You know, I just was pretty reasonably injured.
[00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:37.500]   We just got an MRI.
[00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:39.140]   Doctor says like, hey man, you're out
[00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:41.020]   and you need to take like three weeks off, off.
[00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:42.620]   Don't do anything or you're gonna immediately,
[00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:43.660]   you're gonna tear it the whole way
[00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:45.060]   and this is gonna be surgery.
[00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:46.860]   And then it's gonna be an additional like eight weeks
[00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:49.540]   on top of that to start to rehab it through PT.
[00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:51.660]   And anyway, you know, so I let him know,
[00:42:51.660 --> 00:42:53.220]   hey, if you can push this thing back,
[00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:55.060]   I would love to keep on the car
[00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:55.980]   or love to keep the fight.
[00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:57.780]   You know, it's like I respect you a lot as an opponent.
[00:42:57.780 --> 00:43:00.660]   And also it's been brutal trying to get anybody to sign on.
[00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:02.500]   So if you're into it, I'm still there.
[00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:03.900]   Unfortunately, he turned that down.
[00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:05.540]   I understand he had other things going on
[00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:07.780]   and he and his wife were expecting a child coming up.
[00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:09.780]   So he needed to fight.
[00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:13.740]   And anyway, you know, I guess we'll see what's coming forward.
[00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:15.740]   - Is there somebody who's like super tough
[00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:18.660]   in the featherweight division that you,
[00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:21.660]   you seem to like enjoy the difficult puzzles.
[00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:23.220]   Is there somebody especially difficult
[00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:25.460]   that you would like to fight?
[00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:27.060]   - I would like to fight.
[00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:30.620]   I know that I'll need to win at least one fight before this.
[00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:32.180]   And I look forward to coming back
[00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:34.020]   and giving my best effort to do that.
[00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:36.580]   I wanna fight to beat Magomed Sharapov.
[00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:38.140]   I wanna fight Yair Rodriguez.
[00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:41.500]   I wanna fight a Korean zombie.
[00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:43.540]   And you know, that's amazing. - To be is complicated, man.
[00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:45.300]   - Yeah, that would be fun. - That guy,
[00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:46.700]   I would love to see that fight.
[00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:48.140]   That's a fascinating fight.
[00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:49.540]   - That would be fun.
[00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:50.500]   He would be very challenging.
[00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:52.020]   All those guys are very challenging.
[00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:55.020]   And so I look forward to just staying healthy
[00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:56.380]   to the extent that we can, coming back.
[00:43:56.380 --> 00:43:58.100]   And I'm gonna fight multiple times this year,
[00:43:58.100 --> 00:43:59.020]   hell or high water.
[00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:01.380]   - Hell yes.
[00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:04.020]   Hey, by the way, I completely forgot
[00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:05.460]   'cause you were talking about the systems
[00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:08.900]   and decision trees and the illusion of choice
[00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:12.380]   made me think of Sam Harris and I forgot to mention it.
[00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:14.620]   So he talks about free will quite a bit.
[00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:15.460]   - Huh.
[00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:18.940]   - And that there's an illusion of free will.
[00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:21.660]   So it's like-- - It's a bold claim, Cotton.
[00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:24.100]   - That, you know, maybe the universe constructed
[00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:27.540]   that little game where it makes us feel
[00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:30.100]   like we have a bunch of choices, but we really don't.
[00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:32.780]   We're really always ending up in the middle finger.
[00:44:32.780 --> 00:44:33.900]   - That would be hilarious.
[00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:37.020]   - Yeah, that's what you see before you die.
[00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:38.900]   It's just a giant middle finger.
[00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:40.300]   It's like, oh, fuck.
[00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:41.140]   - I knew it.
[00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:42.460]   I knew it.
[00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:43.300]   - What do you think?
[00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:44.140]   Do you think there's a free will?
[00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:45.980]   Like we feel like we're making choices.
[00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:48.660]   So you're thinking, again, we're talking about,
[00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:51.060]   okay, here's a system of martial arts
[00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:54.060]   that's Hanzo, Gracie, there's different schools
[00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:56.420]   and whatever, and then you're thinking,
[00:44:56.420 --> 00:44:58.420]   okay, how can I think outside these systems?
[00:44:58.420 --> 00:45:03.420]   But then there's also a system that's our human society.
[00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:08.380]   And we feel like there's an actual choice
[00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:11.020]   being made by us individuals.
[00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:12.660]   Do you think that choice is real?
[00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:13.820]   Or is it just an illusion?
[00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:15.540]   - Well, okay, that's a really good question.
[00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:17.380]   I'm not necessarily equipped to answer this,
[00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:18.820]   but I'll do my best.
[00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:21.020]   Okay, I guess I would say to start with,
[00:45:21.020 --> 00:45:23.220]   sure, it would be interesting if it wasn't real,
[00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:25.140]   if the choice wasn't real.
[00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:27.220]   Would be pretty interesting if it is real.
[00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:29.540]   First off, I would start with facilitated beliefs
[00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:31.920]   versus not facilitated beliefs.
[00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:34.520]   It's almost like, I think the world's out to get me.
[00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:38.340]   True, not true, what next?
[00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:39.780]   Probably not a facilitated belief.
[00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:42.900]   Even if you, imagine you believe there's no free will.
[00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:45.460]   Okay, now what?
[00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:48.100]   Does that justify every single impulse
[00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:50.180]   that you're going to give into?
[00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:51.740]   Or does the belief in free will,
[00:45:51.740 --> 00:45:54.140]   does the belief in my ability to work hard,
[00:45:54.140 --> 00:45:57.220]   to focus, to be disciplined, to improve my position,
[00:45:57.220 --> 00:45:59.980]   prove my situation, whether it's true or not,
[00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:01.860]   although I think that at least many of us
[00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:03.940]   would argue that at least whether there's
[00:46:03.940 --> 00:46:06.700]   some sort of internal driver that allows for that.
[00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:07.540]   Yeah.
[00:46:07.540 --> 00:46:09.180]   Like we live in a material world,
[00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:11.060]   your actions do affect the world.
[00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:13.580]   I can choose to pick that water up or not.
[00:46:13.580 --> 00:46:17.060]   And anyway, I would say I believe strongly
[00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:20.280]   in the idea of picking facilitated beliefs.
[00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:24.100]   And going, hey, I will adjust,
[00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:25.980]   whether this belief system is right or wrong
[00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:28.060]   on a cosmic level, I'm nowhere near smart enough
[00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:31.640]   to understand, but I can say me deciding
[00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:33.900]   that let's say, for instance, I'm going to walk over
[00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:36.060]   to have a conversation with someone in the hotel lobby
[00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:37.580]   and I've never met them.
[00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:39.660]   And I go over and I start with,
[00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:40.660]   oh, this is going to be interesting.
[00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:43.120]   And I just walk over there versus in my head,
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:45.540]   I'm like, what's this asshole want?
[00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:47.860]   We're about to have two very different conversations.
[00:46:47.860 --> 00:46:50.140]   I could be right that this person's not very polite
[00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:52.900]   or thinks negatively of me right from go.
[00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:56.220]   But I think that that's probably not a facilitated belief.
[00:46:56.220 --> 00:47:00.020]   People talk about, how is that going to help me
[00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:02.440]   navigate the conversation to a positive conclusion?
[00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:03.820]   And I think about that for,
[00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:07.080]   let's say fighting, it's a good example,
[00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:09.400]   like confidence, plenty of people believe plenty of things
[00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:12.640]   that aren't real, myself included, I'm sure, all the time.
[00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:16.320]   And anyway, believing that you can do something,
[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:17.540]   I'm like, hey, I think I can win.
[00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:19.080]   Doesn't guarantee you a positive outcome,
[00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:22.120]   but I would say it, most of us would probably,
[00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:23.680]   most of us would argue that it helps.
[00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:25.120]   - And you're thinking believing.
[00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:28.040]   - What's depression if not a negative,
[00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:31.500]   unfacilitated belief that is not always,
[00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:33.820]   that oftentimes is not reflected by reality,
[00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:35.780]   but you project it onto reality,
[00:47:35.780 --> 00:47:37.660]   and it's understandable if it makes you feel like,
[00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:39.020]   oh man, this isn't gonna work out,
[00:47:39.020 --> 00:47:40.820]   I don't think the prospects are going well.
[00:47:40.820 --> 00:47:42.760]   And then if you feel like you can't get out of that loop,
[00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:44.420]   that seems pretty rough.
[00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:46.500]   And I see a lot of things out in society right now
[00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:48.520]   where you go, whether you agree or disagree
[00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:49.940]   with various positions on things,
[00:47:49.940 --> 00:47:51.500]   you go, is that a facilitated belief?
[00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:55.500]   Even if that is true, which is arguable, anything,
[00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:56.460]   so what next, man?
[00:47:56.460 --> 00:47:57.500]   So where does this end?
[00:47:57.500 --> 00:48:00.360]   One is the positive, what's the happy ending here?
[00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:01.780]   And if they go, well, there is no happy ending,
[00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:04.220]   I'm like, okay, so now what?
[00:48:04.220 --> 00:48:05.100]   So what do we do here?
[00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:06.260]   And I guess--
[00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:08.780]   - So choose the facilitated belief.
[00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:12.940]   And in your intuition, believing that free will is real
[00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:17.460]   is more productive for a successful life.
[00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:19.900]   - Absolutely, because otherwise, how am I not,
[00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:24.980]   first off, how can society function if it's not real?
[00:48:24.980 --> 00:48:27.900]   So how can I blame you or anyone else
[00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:29.700]   or hold anyone responsible for anything
[00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:31.620]   if free will isn't real?
[00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:34.260]   - Well, no, that's exactly the point.
[00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:37.080]   But at the surface level, what you're saying is true,
[00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:40.220]   but perhaps if we truly internalize
[00:48:40.220 --> 00:48:42.280]   that free will is an illusion,
[00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:43.980]   we'll start to figure out something
[00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:47.620]   that transforms the way we see society.
[00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:51.080]   For example, we are very individual-centric.
[00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:55.980]   So believing that free will is real
[00:48:55.980 --> 00:48:58.500]   puts a lot of responsibility and blame on people
[00:48:58.500 --> 00:49:01.180]   when they do something bad.
[00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:05.740]   Maybe if we truly internalize that free will is an illusion,
[00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:09.100]   we start to think about the system of humans together
[00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:14.260]   as this mechanism for progress
[00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:17.940]   as opposed to where individual people are responsible
[00:49:17.940 --> 00:49:20.300]   for their actions, good or bad.
[00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:24.080]   So we remove the value, the weight we assign
[00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:27.840]   to the accomplishments or the violence,
[00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:29.860]   the negative stuff done by individuals
[00:49:29.860 --> 00:49:32.200]   and more look at the progress of society.
[00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:33.240]   I don't know what that looks like,
[00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:35.460]   but it's almost like as opposed to focusing
[00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:37.680]   on the individual ants of an ant colony,
[00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:40.140]   looking at the entirety of the ant colony.
[00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:42.500]   - So that, I think it makes perfect sense.
[00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:44.760]   I would just say that that's a reasonable thing to suggest.
[00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:46.420]   It's a seismic shift, right?
[00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:49.240]   And it's hard to say whether that would be better or worse,
[00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:52.100]   but I guess I'll use this as a convenient one for me.
[00:49:52.100 --> 00:49:54.720]   So I remember the last time we spoke,
[00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:58.200]   I brought up one of the most reviled evil characters
[00:49:58.200 --> 00:49:59.320]   in certainly recent history,
[00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:01.960]   but probably human history period, Adolf Hitler.
[00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:04.520]   Well, I'm a big fan of making people live in the world
[00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:06.420]   that they wanna believe in.
[00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:08.280]   Well, if free will doesn't exist
[00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:10.240]   and it's just about how things move forward,
[00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:12.680]   when are we gonna be high-fiving this guy or what?
[00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:14.840]   Like this is, 'cause I remember what I said
[00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:17.740]   and that actually brings me to something else we discussed.
[00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:20.480]   - Yeah, for people who don't know,
[00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:23.160]   Ryan brought up, or I brought up,
[00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:25.560]   there's literally a giant book about Hitler.
[00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:28.000]   So I've been obsessed with Hitler, World War II,
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:29.160]   and Stalin recently.
[00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:35.160]   Oh man, this has become like a meme.
[00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:37.880]   Joe Rogan went like DMT and me were like,
[00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:40.240]   can I pick something more positive?
[00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:42.000]   A cat in a hat or something, I don't know.
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.400]   But you brought up Hitler as an example
[00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:45.880]   of something particular,
[00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:48.640]   some philosophical discussions we're having.
[00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:52.000]   And the excellent, eloquent,
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   and the full of integrity MMA journalist
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:01.040]   clipped out something you've said about Hitler
[00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:05.320]   and said that, I forget what the headlines are,
[00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:09.720]   but they were the most ridiculous possible implementation.
[00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:12.120]   - Basically, nitwits intentionally misrepresent,
[00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:14.080]   intentionally misunderstanding what I'm saying.
[00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:15.880]   And it's like, I get that they're stupid,
[00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:16.760]   but I'm stupid too.
[00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:17.740]   So I know what that's like.
[00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:19.520]   So I don't have a lot of sympathy for you.
[00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:20.360]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:21.400]   It's, yeah, exactly.
[00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:23.120]   I can't give you a pass on that.
[00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:25.040]   But basically intentionally misunderstanding
[00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:26.000]   what's going on.
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:29.680]   But what I find funny is that,
[00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:32.200]   hey, we gotta be careful what we believe.
[00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:33.960]   And again, back to the cancel culture thing
[00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:35.600]   that we discussed last time as well,
[00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:37.880]   where would I like to apologize?
[00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:39.480]   I mean, no, actually something about cancel culture
[00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:40.840]   that we've been seeing things culturally.
[00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:43.520]   I'm like, I will be damned if I apologize for anything
[00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:44.840]   that I don't need to apologize for
[00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:47.160]   because I was intentionally misunderstood in that instance.
[00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:48.800]   Now you could say that I don't necessarily,
[00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:50.840]   that I'm not a historical scholar,
[00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:51.680]   which I would agree immediately.
[00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:54.400]   And also that I oftentimes ineloquently
[00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:55.840]   or inarticulately phrase things,
[00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:57.740]   which I'll agree that what is again,
[00:51:57.740 --> 00:52:01.240]   but ultimately going, hey, I wanna make you believe,
[00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:04.880]   live in the world that you're suggesting ought to exist.
[00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:07.840]   Okay, so if there's no free will,
[00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:11.880]   is everything, how far of a step back
[00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:14.720]   are we willing to take cosmically before we start going,
[00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:17.640]   hey, this is good because we're experiencing a social,
[00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:20.480]   you know, a reckoning in our country at the moment,
[00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:24.080]   you know, for good and for other probably, I guess.
[00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:27.280]   And basically, but hey, it all worked out, right?
[00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:30.720]   So that's probably not something that would fly.
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:32.640]   And I think that's a fair thing.
[00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:33.900]   - That's interesting.
[00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:35.760]   It might not fly from the individual perspective,
[00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:38.600]   but if you zoom out and think of, you know,
[00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:43.000]   appreciate society as, you know, just like an ant colony
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.200]   as a beautifully complex system,
[00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:49.360]   like we kinda from the individual perspective,
[00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:52.800]   we value progress, especially progress of the individual,
[00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:55.000]   but in whole progress of societies.
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.440]   But if you accept that this is just a complex system,
[00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:59.920]   that's not necessarily headed anywhere,
[00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:03.080]   that this is almost like that river is just flowing.
[00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:07.600]   I think that removes the burden of always striving,
[00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:10.720]   of always trying, of always like the struggle and so on.
[00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:14.120]   So it's possible that if we have no control,
[00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:17.200]   you can like arrive at some kind of other Zen state.
[00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:19.000]   - Does that sound very human though?
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:22.960]   - That goes against, I think,
[00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:29.040]   our current human condition as we experience it,
[00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:31.280]   but we've communicated that to each other.
[00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:34.440]   Like, we've taught like through these social forces,
[00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:38.120]   taught each other that our lives matter and so on.
[00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:43.120]   Maybe if we convince ourselves that we're just sort of like
[00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:47.360]   little things in a stream and ultimately none of it matters,
[00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:48.720]   there might be some kind of enjoyment
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:50.120]   to be discovered through that process.
[00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:53.280]   I don't, listen, I'm a capitalist, rah, rah, like.
[00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:55.120]   - But I guess I think you're bringing up
[00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:56.080]   a really important point.
[00:53:56.080 --> 00:53:58.280]   Like I guess almost anything like capitalism,
[00:53:58.280 --> 00:54:01.720]   I only get to experience it as I sit here now
[00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:03.960]   and I get to live, I was raised in the United States,
[00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:05.480]   have traveled around the world a little bit,
[00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:07.840]   have had the good fortune of meeting many people
[00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:09.200]   from many different places.
[00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:12.800]   And I'm an end user of capitalism.
[00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:14.320]   I don't really know how it got here,
[00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:16.760]   whether it was, I wasn't there at the start of this idea.
[00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:19.280]   I wasn't there for, hey, how do we come up with this idea?
[00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:20.100]   How do we arrive?
[00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:22.360]   And I'm nowhere near well read enough to understand
[00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:24.920]   any of that really, even secondhand.
[00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:27.880]   And I guess recognizing that communism, Marxism,
[00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:30.560]   socialism, anarchism, anything is,
[00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:33.200]   these are all perspectives that all have,
[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:35.560]   I guess, various strengths and weaknesses.
[00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:37.760]   But I guess one thing I'm always,
[00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:39.100]   I guess I would say the burden,
[00:54:39.100 --> 00:54:42.280]   it seems to me that if you wanna make a change,
[00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:45.880]   the burden of proof is on the person
[00:54:45.880 --> 00:54:47.720]   implying that there needs to be a change.
[00:54:47.720 --> 00:54:49.860]   And it doesn't mean that there's nothing there,
[00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:51.840]   but it's like, if you wanna create a small shift,
[00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:54.640]   a ripple, that's fine, but a seismic ripping shift
[00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:56.840]   in how we exist or how we experience the world
[00:54:56.840 --> 00:54:57.680]   as human beings.
[00:54:57.680 --> 00:54:58.500]   And you mentioned fighting,
[00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:01.120]   why watching someone undergo,
[00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:05.120]   take abuse on a level in the ring that's just shocking
[00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:07.100]   and then triumph in spite of it is like,
[00:55:07.100 --> 00:55:09.200]   it's you're like, this is unbelievable.
[00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:11.660]   This is part of the magic of combat sports.
[00:55:11.660 --> 00:55:13.080]   Now, it's part of the magic,
[00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:14.760]   the other side of the magic that doesn't get talked about
[00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:16.440]   sometimes is that the trajectory
[00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:20.560]   of that individual's life later on is not always great,
[00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:22.720]   or there's a little phrase, there's a cost for that.
[00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:26.360]   But if this, if we remember,
[00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:28.120]   you mentioned removing the struggle.
[00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:30.160]   I don't, personally, the struggle
[00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:33.000]   is what makes life life.
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:35.440]   And also, I guess, something Faraz has brought up to me
[00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:37.640]   on a number of occasions is that,
[00:55:37.640 --> 00:55:38.600]   and it makes sense to me,
[00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:42.440]   it's basically humans only understand things
[00:55:42.440 --> 00:55:43.720]   through relative comparison.
[00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:47.640]   I only understand heat because I've known cold.
[00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:48.880]   I only understand, it's, I guess,
[00:55:48.880 --> 00:55:50.140]   like it's like talking to someone
[00:55:50.140 --> 00:55:52.360]   that's never experienced any sort of hardship
[00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:54.400]   and then their latte isn't right.
[00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:56.280]   And then they pitch a fit
[00:55:56.280 --> 00:55:58.260]   versus someone that's gone through a great deal
[00:55:58.260 --> 00:56:00.880]   of challenge, struggle in their life.
[00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:03.660]   They tend to have a little bit more of an even perspective.
[00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:07.320]   And anyway, and of course, even as a relative thing,
[00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:09.080]   and what I perceive to be even may not be even,
[00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:10.560]   maybe I'm particularly softer
[00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:12.640]   or it's something in the other direction without realizing
[00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:14.580]   'cause I can only understand what I can understand.
[00:56:14.580 --> 00:56:19.360]   But the idea that we wanna fundamentally alter ourselves
[00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:21.000]   as a species and as people
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:25.320]   seems like a incredibly, incredibly high bar to prove.
[00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:27.760]   And also like an incredibly dangerous idea
[00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:29.560]   because it always comes back to,
[00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:31.040]   who's gonna be responsible for this?
[00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:32.580]   Who gets to do the choosing?
[00:56:32.580 --> 00:56:33.420]   What's a good idea?
[00:56:33.420 --> 00:56:34.240]   What's not a good idea?
[00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:36.400]   And I guess that actually brings me kind of to a,
[00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:38.040]   something I've been encountering recently
[00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:40.160]   in discussions with friends.
[00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:42.680]   I feel like there's only two types of people
[00:56:42.680 --> 00:56:44.560]   that I encounter at this point.
[00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:48.880]   People with a more or less libertarian tilt
[00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:51.160]   to their thinking and people without it.
[00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:52.200]   And when I say libertarian,
[00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:54.080]   I don't mean that in the political party sense
[00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:55.360]   or even the belief system.
[00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:57.600]   Basically, I'm like, hey, you do you, buddy.
[00:56:57.600 --> 00:57:00.280]   It's not my, what you're up to is not my concern
[00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:01.920]   versus what you're up to is my concern.
[00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:04.660]   And I guess I've always watched various points in history,
[00:57:04.660 --> 00:57:06.200]   people on this side or people on that side
[00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:10.240]   are more or less, I guess, problematic,
[00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:11.080]   I guess you could say.
[00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:13.440]   I don't mean that in the internet sense.
[00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:15.120]   You know, more of an issue.
[00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:18.480]   But the world is always full of people
[00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:20.880]   that wanna tell you what you need to be doing
[00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:22.720]   as opposed to more or less doing a harm.
[00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:24.000]   And I guess that's one of the ones.
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.840]   Anytime I'm trying to tell other people what to do,
[00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:28.000]   I better hope I'm right.
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.600]   And it's bizarre to me how many people are so confident
[00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:32.560]   that their side or their position
[00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:34.280]   is the one that's not only right for them,
[00:57:34.280 --> 00:57:36.420]   but right enough that they can enforce it on others.
[00:57:36.420 --> 00:57:38.840]   And that just seems incredibly dangerous to me.
[00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:41.380]   And I guess that comes back to even Sam's point
[00:57:41.380 --> 00:57:43.600]   about, oh, we want to,
[00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:46.240]   trying to spread the idea that free will doesn't exist,
[00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:48.440]   I'm not saying it's damaging, but it very well may be.
[00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:50.000]   And plenty of other things could be as well.
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:52.000]   I'm not, you know, it goes way over my head
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:53.760]   as to the implications of all of these.
[00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:56.320]   And I guess all of us are an evangelist for something.
[00:57:56.320 --> 00:58:00.880]   But I guess it's weird that we've gotten this far
[00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:03.960]   as a species, and now we want to take like sharp,
[00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:05.280]   sharp turns.
[00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:06.840]   - Well, we've been taking a bunch of sharp turns
[00:58:06.840 --> 00:58:07.680]   throughout history.
[00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:08.520]   - Yeah.
[00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:10.960]   - That's what, you know, that's the way,
[00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:13.960]   okay, humans love power.
[00:58:13.960 --> 00:58:16.040]   And one way to attain power is to say,
[00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:18.160]   everything that you guys are doing is wrong,
[00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:19.320]   and I have the right thing,
[00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:21.880]   and I'm going to build up a giant cult of people,
[00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:23.520]   and I'm going to overthrow.
[00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:25.840]   And indirectly what that results in
[00:58:25.840 --> 00:58:27.240]   is me gaining power.
[00:58:27.240 --> 00:58:30.240]   And that's how you get all the big revolutions
[00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:32.840]   in human history, saying I'm done with the thing
[00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:35.200]   that the powerful are currently doing,
[00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:36.280]   so I'm going to overthrow.
[00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:39.840]   That's where probably all the identity politics
[00:58:39.840 --> 00:58:43.200]   that's happening now is people that didn't have power before
[00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:45.080]   are looking to gain power.
[00:58:45.080 --> 00:58:47.320]   And they're also, you know, that's where
[00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:49.780]   Jordan Peterson criticizes identity politics
[00:58:49.780 --> 00:58:53.960]   is people with the right, with the good intentions,
[00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:58.000]   I should say, are in seeking power,
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:01.920]   allow power to corrupt them, as power always does.
[00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:06.920]   And so they lose track of like the devils
[00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:11.400]   that they're fighting by becoming the same kind of devils,
[00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:13.840]   the same kind of evil that they're fighting.
[00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:16.000]   And so that's just the progress of human history.
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:20.440]   But hopefully, as these power greedy people
[00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:24.760]   keep attaining power with a progressive mindset,
[00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:26.800]   over time, things get better and better as they--
[00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:28.000]   - Like each iteration?
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:29.160]   - Each iteration.
[00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:34.160]   A lot of unfairness happens, a lot of hypocrisy happens.
[00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:38.320]   A lot of people are trampled along the way
[00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:40.520]   by those who mean well.
[00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:42.560]   But over time, like lessons are learned,
[00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:46.420]   or like human civilization accumulates lessons,
[00:59:46.420 --> 00:59:49.300]   and in part learns lessons of history,
[00:59:49.300 --> 00:59:50.800]   and it gets better and better over time,
[00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:52.840]   even though in the short term,
[00:59:52.840 --> 00:59:55.400]   there's people acting not their best selves.
[00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:59.840]   And you know, that seems to be the progress
[00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:01.160]   of human history.
[01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:05.480]   The idea of internalizing the free will not being real,
[01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:07.440]   you're actually making me realize that
[01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:09.240]   that ultimately leads to a kind of--
[01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:12.680]   - Doesn't that go in a nihilistic direction?
[01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:14.660]   - Yeah, it's both nihilistic,
[01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:16.840]   or if you wanna make it a political system,
[01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:19.800]   then it's more like communist type of a system
[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:22.560]   where like the value of the individual
[01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:25.960]   is completely reduced, removed.
[01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:30.640]   Or another perspective is like the freedom of an individual
[01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:32.400]   is not to be valued or protected.
[01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:35.260]   And so from our current perspective,
[01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:36.760]   the systems that seem to have worked,
[01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:39.600]   the United States works pretty damn well,
[01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:41.240]   despite all the different criticisms.
[01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:45.880]   It seems like freedom of the individual in all its forms
[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:49.400]   seems to be fundamental to the success of the United States.
[01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:53.560]   And so we should, it's however the hell you put it,
[01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:55.840]   is like, doesn't matter whether free will
[01:00:55.840 --> 01:01:00.840]   is or isn't an illusion, the belief that it's real--
[01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:02.460]   - Protects the individual from the group,
[01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:04.160]   which is fundamentally, correct me if I'm wrong,
[01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:06.520]   that always seems like the big issue of history.
[01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:09.960]   Hey, there's more of me than there is of you, deal with it.
[01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:11.640]   You're like, yikes.
[01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:13.520]   And you wanna be yourself, you wanna be different,
[01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:14.840]   you wanna have a different religion,
[01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:16.440]   you wanna be a different skin color, you wanna do this.
[01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:19.040]   All the bad tribal things happen
[01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:20.880]   when there's more of me than you.
[01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:21.720]   Correct me if I'm wrong.
[01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:23.320]   - Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:24.440]   - But then that's always the fundamental
[01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:26.120]   power imbalance though, right?
[01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:28.560]   - Well, the interesting thing about the libertarian thinking
[01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:30.680]   I guess I, I don't know, those words are really--
[01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:32.160]   - Maybe they're all charged, I know what you mean.
[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:33.000]   - Yeah, they're all charged.
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.680]   - I may not scale up, but I mean,
[01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:36.360]   we're more like on a philosophical underpinning
[01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:37.480]   where you're like, yeah, basically,
[01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:39.840]   hey, you feel free to believe I'm a fool.
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:42.160]   And plenty of people do, I'm sure.
[01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:44.980]   But as long as you don't chase me down the hall
[01:01:44.980 --> 01:01:47.280]   and hit me in the back of the head with a textbook,
[01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:48.240]   what's the big deal?
[01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:50.800]   - Yeah, so the libertarian viewpoint,
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:53.160]   which I probably espouse, like that's,
[01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:57.320]   I very much like freedom of the individual
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:02:00.720]   is very valuable and like leave others the fuck alone
[01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:02.960]   unless they're trying to hurt you.
[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:05.920]   The thing is, you also have to, I believe,
[01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:09.640]   put in the work of empathy of understanding
[01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:13.840]   what others, how, what leaving people the fuck alone
[01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:14.920]   means to others.
[01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:16.200]   - But isn't that an interesting thing?
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:18.660]   If I believe in freedom of the individual
[01:02:18.660 --> 01:02:20.360]   and I take that, like all of these, like you said,
[01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:23.000]   you take them past just their first quite why question,
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.280]   you ask why, why, why, why, or how, how, how, how many times
[01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:28.760]   should that not extend to respect for you,
[01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:29.880]   respect for your position,
[01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:32.160]   respect for your individual lived experience,
[01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:34.600]   which could be grossly different than mine.
[01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:37.880]   - Yeah, this is the problem with saying I'm an individual,
[01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:40.400]   I'm not gonna bother you, you don't bother me.
[01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:43.220]   That's just like, that's not actionable
[01:02:43.220 --> 01:02:46.400]   because to make it actionable, you have to think
[01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:49.600]   the why, why, why, why, why, you have to do the steps beyond.
[01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:50.920]   You think what does that actually mean?
[01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:54.880]   That means understanding how even my very existence
[01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:59.760]   like hurts others because you have to understand
[01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:02.240]   that like you're not just sitting alone in a room.
[01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:04.880]   You're using like public transit,
[01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:06.140]   you're using the police force,
[01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:09.120]   you're using firefighters, you're using the,
[01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:11.200]   like you're using a lot of resources
[01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:15.360]   that are publicly shared and some of those resources
[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:18.960]   are unfairly distributed.
[01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:21.880]   Like we've agreed that we're gonna pay taxes
[01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:24.560]   and those taxes are gonna go towards building
[01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:26.000]   some kind of infrastructure.
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.760]   So that's already towards social.
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:30.880]   So you're not a real, you're not a real,
[01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:33.280]   sort of like talk to Michael Malice, like anarchist, right?
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:37.820]   Saying like basically full, just leave me the fuck alone
[01:03:37.820 --> 01:03:40.900]   and I'm going to collaborate with whoever the hell I want.
[01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:43.920]   We're not, that's not the American society
[01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:45.540]   as it stands currently.
[01:03:45.540 --> 01:03:47.940]   We've agreed that there's going to be
[01:03:47.940 --> 01:03:51.740]   certain social institutions that we pay into
[01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:55.140]   and some of the sort of discussions about race
[01:03:55.140 --> 01:03:59.580]   and all those kinds of things is about those institutions
[01:03:59.580 --> 01:04:04.580]   being institutionally unfair, whether it's race or gender,
[01:04:04.580 --> 01:04:06.000]   all those kinds of things.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.600]   Listen, I have a bunch of criticisms
[01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:12.000]   of the way that conversation carries itself out
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:15.600]   but the thing is, what's valuable is to actually listen
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:20.520]   and empathize and that's not often talked about
[01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:23.440]   with the leave me the fuck alone mindset
[01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:28.440]   because you're, it doesn't have that little component
[01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:31.580]   which I think could be fundamental
[01:04:31.580 --> 01:04:34.200]   to the function of a society which is like social.
[01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:38.880]   Like it's the, what is it, the Obama, you didn't build it?
[01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:41.200]   Or you didn't build it alone or whatever,
[01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:44.140]   however that goes but basically we wouldn't be,
[01:04:44.140 --> 01:04:46.320]   we wouldn't be able to accomplish anything as individuals
[01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:48.140]   without the help of others.
[01:04:48.140 --> 01:04:50.440]   And to be able to then start to think,
[01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:55.440]   okay, so what is my duty, what is my responsibility
[01:04:56.100 --> 01:04:59.620]   to other human beings to be respectful, to be loving,
[01:04:59.620 --> 01:05:03.020]   to help them as part of this functioning society?
[01:05:03.020 --> 01:05:04.860]   That starts, that's actually a lot of work
[01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:05.700]   to start to think about that.
[01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:07.140]   - For sure. - 'Cause then I have to like,
[01:05:07.140 --> 01:05:09.540]   think, okay, Ryan, what's his life like?
[01:05:09.540 --> 01:05:12.980]   Like as a business owner during COVID, what's that like?
[01:05:12.980 --> 01:05:16.340]   And then he has, there's employees that run the gym,
[01:05:16.340 --> 01:05:17.220]   what's that like?
[01:05:17.220 --> 01:05:18.620]   What's that stress like?
[01:05:18.620 --> 01:05:20.340]   Or about the fighting and the injury and so on,
[01:05:20.340 --> 01:05:21.180]   what's that like?
[01:05:21.180 --> 01:05:24.900]   That empathy takes a lot of like compute cycles.
[01:05:24.900 --> 01:05:26.740]   - That's fair, that's a lot of energy, right?
[01:05:26.740 --> 01:05:29.220]   - But I have to go through that computation
[01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:34.220]   if I want to be an individual that's like, doesn't hurt you.
[01:05:34.220 --> 01:05:38.740]   - If I may, I guess like to come back to Muhammad Ali,
[01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:40.460]   one of the things he said is service to others
[01:05:40.460 --> 01:05:43.020]   is the rent that you pay for your,
[01:05:43.020 --> 01:05:45.180]   you know, is the price you pay for your rent here on earth.
[01:05:45.180 --> 01:05:47.140]   - Yeah. - And now,
[01:05:47.140 --> 01:05:48.660]   one of the things that I think that I see
[01:05:48.660 --> 01:05:50.100]   as a result of the internet all the time
[01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:53.780]   is people talking about global giant problems,
[01:05:53.780 --> 01:05:57.860]   social problems that are society-wide that are massive,
[01:05:57.860 --> 01:05:59.820]   like truly massive and frankly,
[01:05:59.820 --> 01:06:03.940]   beyond the power of any of us to solve.
[01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:04.780]   - Yeah. - And certainly
[01:06:04.780 --> 01:06:06.060]   on an individual level.
[01:06:06.060 --> 01:06:08.420]   So I've discussed things with friends,
[01:06:08.420 --> 01:06:10.180]   like my father's an environmental attorney,
[01:06:10.180 --> 01:06:12.300]   like, you know, has been for a long time
[01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:14.180]   and has been an engineer for a long time.
[01:06:14.180 --> 01:06:17.300]   And, you know, so I'm not, I barely know anything,
[01:06:17.300 --> 01:06:19.420]   but I'm reading a little bit of various things.
[01:06:19.420 --> 01:06:21.940]   But climate change, oh my God,
[01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:23.380]   I'm so concerned about climate change.
[01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:25.380]   I'm like, what am I supposed to do about climate change?
[01:06:25.380 --> 01:06:27.540]   I'll tell you what I can do is I can not litter,
[01:06:27.540 --> 01:06:30.220]   I can try to conserve energy where I can,
[01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:31.340]   I can do whatever I want.
[01:06:31.340 --> 01:06:36.340]   What can I personally do about some giant social problem
[01:06:36.340 --> 01:06:40.260]   that I didn't start and is out of my control?
[01:06:40.260 --> 01:06:42.780]   I'm like, well, I can be decent to the people around me.
[01:06:42.780 --> 01:06:44.620]   I can mention, I can demonstrate empathy
[01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:46.180]   and I can demonstrate consideration
[01:06:46.180 --> 01:06:47.780]   for the people in my circle.
[01:06:47.780 --> 01:06:50.380]   And to the extent that I can, the people outside of my circle
[01:06:50.380 --> 01:06:52.740]   but yelling at the trees over things that,
[01:06:52.740 --> 01:06:55.860]   over problems that are borderline cosmic
[01:06:55.860 --> 01:06:57.220]   doesn't seem very productive.
[01:06:57.220 --> 01:06:59.420]   It just makes me feel like I'm cool and important
[01:06:59.420 --> 01:07:00.740]   because I'm talking about something,
[01:07:00.740 --> 01:07:02.700]   well, hundreds of years from now, the water will rise.
[01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:03.580]   Maybe it will, maybe it won't.
[01:07:03.580 --> 01:07:05.100]   I can't, it's completely off my head.
[01:07:05.100 --> 01:07:06.140]   I know nothing.
[01:07:06.140 --> 01:07:09.380]   But focusing on the problems that we can actually solve,
[01:07:09.380 --> 01:07:10.500]   it comes back to the same thing.
[01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:11.460]   I want to win a fight.
[01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:13.340]   I would love to win a fight.
[01:07:13.340 --> 01:07:14.220]   I can't control that.
[01:07:14.220 --> 01:07:16.340]   What I can do is I can control each individual step
[01:07:16.340 --> 01:07:17.300]   that I take around the ring
[01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:19.220]   and try to make the next correct move.
[01:07:19.220 --> 01:07:21.820]   I can't look, no, it gets people's,
[01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:24.540]   they get all excited.
[01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:25.900]   I'm trying to keep my language in check,
[01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:29.860]   but they get all excited thinking about problems that are,
[01:07:29.860 --> 01:07:32.620]   Superman couldn't solve these problems.
[01:07:32.620 --> 01:07:34.180]   You could be that powerful
[01:07:34.180 --> 01:07:36.540]   and you can't make all of the bad things go away,
[01:07:36.540 --> 01:07:38.420]   but you can absolutely change yourself.
[01:07:38.420 --> 01:07:40.820]   And I think a lot of the lessons that,
[01:07:40.820 --> 01:07:42.900]   the good lessons from religion that happened,
[01:07:42.900 --> 01:07:44.660]   the good lessons from the great men and women
[01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:47.380]   throughout history that we're inspired by
[01:07:47.380 --> 01:07:50.060]   that talk about change starting with within.
[01:07:50.060 --> 01:07:52.660]   And again, treating the people around you decently
[01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:54.020]   and treating the people around you decently
[01:07:54.020 --> 01:07:55.980]   doesn't even necessarily mean the golden rule,
[01:07:55.980 --> 01:07:57.980]   do unto others as you would like them to do to you.
[01:07:57.980 --> 01:08:00.260]   I go, well, maybe what I would like
[01:08:00.260 --> 01:08:02.100]   and what this person would like, aren't the same thing.
[01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:03.460]   Well, how am I going to get to the bottom of that?
[01:08:03.460 --> 01:08:05.820]   'Cause I could be attempting to be decent to this person.
[01:08:05.820 --> 01:08:07.340]   And by my standard, I am being decent,
[01:08:07.340 --> 01:08:09.860]   but maybe I'm missing the mark by theirs.
[01:08:09.860 --> 01:08:13.180]   Well, I can't possibly, if I just interacted with you,
[01:08:13.180 --> 01:08:14.220]   like it's like someone talking about
[01:08:14.220 --> 01:08:15.580]   some nonsense microaggression.
[01:08:15.580 --> 01:08:16.660]   You're like, so let me get this straight.
[01:08:16.660 --> 01:08:18.740]   I've never met you before, you never met me before.
[01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:20.740]   And you're interpreting some minor comment
[01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:24.300]   that I've made in the least charitable way possible.
[01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:26.020]   I'm not saying that you couldn't be annoyed,
[01:08:26.020 --> 01:08:29.180]   but your expectation for that level of consideration
[01:08:29.180 --> 01:08:32.000]   is you're gonna be disappointed a lot.
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.580]   Now, if you're someone that's in your life
[01:08:34.580 --> 01:08:36.020]   on a consistent basis and they're like,
[01:08:36.020 --> 01:08:37.340]   hey, I really don't appreciate what you're saying
[01:08:37.340 --> 01:08:38.180]   or what you're doing here.
[01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:40.940]   Do you realize that this is how I'm perceiving it?
[01:08:40.940 --> 01:08:42.740]   And you go, oh man, I'm so sorry.
[01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:44.220]   Of course I would hear what you have to say.
[01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:47.620]   But I guess trying to recognize that,
[01:08:47.620 --> 01:08:52.540]   I guess my job is to treat others with dignity in general,
[01:08:52.540 --> 01:08:56.460]   but that level of specificity that that requires
[01:08:56.460 --> 01:08:58.380]   increases as it gets closer to you.
[01:08:58.380 --> 01:09:01.100]   And I have, as a person, I have a very finite amount
[01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:03.660]   of resources financially, intellectually,
[01:09:03.660 --> 01:09:05.740]   emotionally, physically.
[01:09:05.740 --> 01:09:08.500]   If I chuck 0.001% of it
[01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:11.360]   in every single different direction, what am I doing?
[01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:12.200]   It's like when people are like,
[01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:13.860]   oh, I care deeply about Tibet.
[01:09:13.860 --> 01:09:15.220]   I'm like, why aren't you over there?
[01:09:15.220 --> 01:09:16.500]   Go build a house, man.
[01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:18.620]   Get on a plane, go build a house.
[01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:19.560]   Oh, you don't wanna do that.
[01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:21.540]   So really what you wanna do is post on Facebook
[01:09:21.540 --> 01:09:24.700]   and accept high fives for how much of a good guy you are.
[01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:25.700]   I got an idea.
[01:09:25.700 --> 01:09:27.220]   Go help somebody in your neighborhood.
[01:09:27.220 --> 01:09:29.460]   Go play with some kids.
[01:09:29.460 --> 01:09:31.780]   Go be a friend to someone that doesn't have a friend.
[01:09:31.780 --> 01:09:33.740]   Read a book, try to educate yourself.
[01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:35.980]   And so I guess to come back,
[01:09:35.980 --> 01:09:38.920]   all of these problems aren't solvable on a grand scale,
[01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:41.760]   but it's almost like by attempting to address them
[01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:43.700]   in our personal lives, we do better.
[01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:46.420]   But rather than a giant airing of the grievances
[01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:48.260]   on a consistent basis,
[01:09:48.260 --> 01:09:51.260]   not that that isn't sometimes necessary and valuable,
[01:09:51.260 --> 01:09:53.420]   but after you air your grievances,
[01:09:53.420 --> 01:09:55.340]   you go, hey, how about we sort this out?
[01:09:55.340 --> 01:09:56.700]   What's the next step?
[01:09:56.700 --> 01:09:59.820]   And I guess, again, when we're trying to address it
[01:09:59.820 --> 01:10:02.380]   on a giant social level, it just seems unmanageable to me,
[01:10:02.380 --> 01:10:04.560]   even if you have the best of intentions.
[01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:06.060]   - Yeah, I mean, but nevertheless,
[01:10:06.060 --> 01:10:09.300]   there's a lot you can do on social networks.
[01:10:09.300 --> 01:10:12.940]   I mean, I enjoy tweeting and consuming Twitter.
[01:10:12.940 --> 01:10:15.220]   It's just I apply the exact same principle
[01:10:15.220 --> 01:10:19.340]   that you just said, which is free will and discussion,
[01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:23.460]   which is like I approach it in a way
[01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:25.880]   that I don't get stuck in this loop
[01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:27.460]   that's counterproductive.
[01:10:27.460 --> 01:10:30.620]   I try to do things that are productive.
[01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:32.520]   And it's just like you said,
[01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:36.380]   that's like what kind of things can I do in this world,
[01:10:36.380 --> 01:10:38.580]   whether that's tweeting or building things,
[01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:41.020]   those are low effort tweeting,
[01:10:41.020 --> 01:10:44.340]   or actually building businesses or building ideas out,
[01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:45.660]   that's high effort.
[01:10:45.660 --> 01:10:47.780]   What can I do that will actually solve problems?
[01:10:47.780 --> 01:10:49.740]   And that's the way I approach it.
[01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:53.000]   And I do wonder if it's possible to, at scale,
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:56.500]   encourage each other to approach like social media
[01:10:56.500 --> 01:10:58.960]   and communication with fellow humans in that way.
[01:10:58.960 --> 01:10:59.800]   I don't know.
[01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:00.940]   - How do you think that will be done?
[01:11:00.940 --> 01:11:03.860]   I guess like to improve the quality of discourse maybe.
[01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:04.800]   Like, or even like you said,
[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:07.100]   the empathy or the decency of discourse.
[01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:10.900]   - I think people should be incentivized
[01:11:10.900 --> 01:11:12.100]   and encouraged to do that.
[01:11:12.100 --> 01:11:16.620]   I think most of what we see happening on Twitter
[01:11:16.620 --> 01:11:20.700]   and Facebook and so on has to do with very small,
[01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:25.020]   but very powerful implementation details.
[01:11:25.020 --> 01:11:26.500]   It goes down to like,
[01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:28.660]   what is the source of the dopamine rush,
[01:11:28.660 --> 01:11:32.460]   the like button, the sharing mechanisms.
[01:11:32.460 --> 01:11:35.420]   Just even small tweaks in those can fix a lot.
[01:11:35.420 --> 01:11:36.260]   - Really?
[01:11:36.260 --> 01:11:37.100]   - I believe so.
[01:11:37.100 --> 01:11:39.260]   So like a lot of the stuff we see now
[01:11:39.260 --> 01:11:41.900]   is the result of just initial implementations
[01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:44.660]   of these systems that we didn't anticipate.
[01:11:44.660 --> 01:11:49.180]   So the modernization comes from engagement
[01:11:49.180 --> 01:11:54.020]   and the tools we have is clicking like and sharing.
[01:11:54.020 --> 01:11:55.740]   It was not always obvious.
[01:11:55.740 --> 01:11:57.180]   It was not obvious from the beginning.
[01:11:57.180 --> 01:12:00.160]   It wasn't obvious while Twitter and Facebook grew
[01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:01.860]   that there's a big dopamine rush
[01:12:01.860 --> 01:12:05.180]   from getting more followers and likes and shares.
[01:12:05.180 --> 01:12:06.980]   So we've gotten addicted to this feeling
[01:12:06.980 --> 01:12:08.300]   like how many people are commenting,
[01:12:08.300 --> 01:12:10.620]   how many people are saying like,
[01:12:10.620 --> 01:12:12.100]   clicking like and so on.
[01:12:12.100 --> 01:12:13.400]   So that's that dopamine rush.
[01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:16.300]   So we want to say the thing that will get the most likes
[01:12:16.300 --> 01:12:19.900]   and like unmask in society.
[01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:22.140]   And then the other thing that was expected
[01:12:22.140 --> 01:12:25.780]   is the controversial, the divisive will get the most likes.
[01:12:25.780 --> 01:12:28.760]   So it had to do with the initial mechanisms
[01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:32.020]   of likes and shares resulting in an outcome
[01:12:32.020 --> 01:12:33.120]   that was unpredicted,
[01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:35.740]   which is huge amounts of division,
[01:12:35.740 --> 01:12:40.740]   irrespective of like any of the basics of human connection
[01:12:40.740 --> 01:12:43.380]   that we've actually all come to understand
[01:12:43.380 --> 01:12:46.500]   that society is valuable at the individual level,
[01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:49.900]   like we're saying, but unmask what results
[01:12:49.900 --> 01:12:51.460]   is like you throw all that out
[01:12:51.460 --> 01:12:55.340]   and it's all just divisive at scale discourse.
[01:12:55.340 --> 01:13:02.100]   I think it could be fixed by incentivizing personal growth,
[01:13:02.100 --> 01:13:05.380]   like incentivizing you to challenge yourself,
[01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:07.860]   to grow as an individual,
[01:13:07.860 --> 01:13:11.460]   and most importantly, to be happy at the end of the day.
[01:13:11.460 --> 01:13:16.460]   So feed, like incentivize you feeling good
[01:13:16.460 --> 01:13:21.820]   as in a way that's long lasting, long-term.
[01:13:21.820 --> 01:13:24.260]   I think what makes people actually feel good
[01:13:24.260 --> 01:13:27.540]   is being kind to others long-term.
[01:13:27.540 --> 01:13:29.260]   In the short term, what feels good
[01:13:29.260 --> 01:13:31.260]   is getting a lot of likes.
[01:13:31.260 --> 01:13:34.660]   And I think those are just different incentives
[01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:36.540]   that if implemented correctly,
[01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:37.980]   you could just build social networks
[01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:38.900]   that would do much better.
[01:13:38.900 --> 01:13:41.060]   - So do you think it comes from a structural perspective?
[01:13:41.060 --> 01:13:43.620]   I guess at what point does you mentioned free will,
[01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:45.660]   and also you mentioned feeling good,
[01:13:45.660 --> 01:13:46.940]   and again, working hard.
[01:13:46.940 --> 01:13:51.700]   I know that you have, I guess, was it a race or?
[01:13:51.700 --> 01:13:54.420]   - No, it's the Goggins thing.
[01:13:54.420 --> 01:13:57.460]   It's four by four by 48 challenge
[01:13:57.460 --> 01:14:00.620]   where you run four miles every four hours for two days.
[01:14:00.620 --> 01:14:01.460]   - That's awesome.
[01:14:01.460 --> 01:14:05.740]   - And it's a bunch of, the challenge of it
[01:14:05.740 --> 01:14:06.860]   isn't just the running.
[01:14:06.860 --> 01:14:07.780]   The running is very tough,
[01:14:07.780 --> 01:14:09.900]   but it's mostly the sleep deprivation
[01:14:09.900 --> 01:14:11.780]   'cause you're just training every four hours.
[01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:13.340]   - But it's a struggle, right?
[01:14:13.340 --> 01:14:14.820]   But the struggle gives meaning.
[01:14:14.820 --> 01:14:17.500]   And ultimately, I guess, so how can we,
[01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:18.580]   'cause you mentioned, like you said,
[01:14:18.580 --> 01:14:21.060]   adjusting things on like a, I guess,
[01:14:21.060 --> 01:14:23.780]   like a programming level, almost, a base programming level
[01:14:23.780 --> 01:14:25.740]   so that the interface is different for the user.
[01:14:25.740 --> 01:14:28.580]   But at what point does the user have a responsibility
[01:14:28.580 --> 01:14:31.340]   to, as a man or a woman or a person,
[01:14:31.340 --> 01:14:34.260]   to just behave more decently?
[01:14:34.260 --> 01:14:37.380]   How can we, I guess, utilize, what can we do?
[01:14:37.380 --> 01:14:40.900]   It seems like our society is so grossly missing
[01:14:40.900 --> 01:14:42.340]   like a Martin Luther King right now,
[01:14:42.340 --> 01:14:44.500]   like the great inspiring characters
[01:14:44.500 --> 01:14:46.900]   throughout American history, throughout world history.
[01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:48.500]   Where are the great leaders?
[01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:49.940]   - So leadership is part of it,
[01:14:49.940 --> 01:14:52.740]   but that's definitely, where are the great leaders
[01:14:52.740 --> 01:14:53.700]   is a very good question.
[01:14:53.700 --> 01:14:56.740]   That's more of a question of our political systems,
[01:14:56.740 --> 01:14:58.900]   why they're not pushing forward the great leaders.
[01:14:58.900 --> 01:15:02.740]   But there's also just, okay,
[01:15:02.740 --> 01:15:05.420]   there's some just basic engineering shit,
[01:15:05.420 --> 01:15:09.540]   which is when you and I, when you, Ryan,
[01:15:09.540 --> 01:15:13.100]   and I are in a room alone and we're talking,
[01:15:13.100 --> 01:15:14.540]   even if we're strangers,
[01:15:14.540 --> 01:15:17.780]   the incentives are for us to get along.
[01:15:17.780 --> 01:15:20.420]   Like just when we're together in person,
[01:15:20.420 --> 01:15:21.260]   that's what I'm saying.
[01:15:21.260 --> 01:15:22.660]   I'm not even saying some kind of profound--
[01:15:22.660 --> 01:15:23.780]   - But when you remove that.
[01:15:23.780 --> 01:15:26.700]   - When we remove that, the implementation
[01:15:26.700 --> 01:15:30.540]   of social networks as they stand right now
[01:15:30.540 --> 01:15:31.820]   in the digital space,
[01:15:31.820 --> 01:15:33.940]   a very different set of incentives.
[01:15:33.940 --> 01:15:38.140]   It's more fond to destroy others, to be shitty to others.
[01:15:38.140 --> 01:15:42.860]   And it becomes this endless loop,
[01:15:42.860 --> 01:15:43.700]   like you were saying,
[01:15:43.700 --> 01:15:45.740]   that's ultimately destructive and not productive.
[01:15:45.740 --> 01:15:49.540]   And I think it has to do with just the interfaces
[01:15:49.540 --> 01:15:54.420]   of making it feel good to be nice to others.
[01:15:54.420 --> 01:15:58.220]   'Cause currently it doesn't feel nearly as good
[01:15:58.220 --> 01:16:01.060]   to be nice to others on the internet.
[01:16:01.060 --> 01:16:04.860]   And it doesn't feel nearly as bad
[01:16:04.860 --> 01:16:07.540]   as it does in real life to be shitty to others on the internet.
[01:16:07.540 --> 01:16:09.380]   So the incentives are just wrong.
[01:16:09.380 --> 01:16:13.300]   I think there is a technology solution to this,
[01:16:13.300 --> 01:16:15.820]   or at least a solution to improve
[01:16:15.820 --> 01:16:17.820]   this communication mechanism.
[01:16:17.820 --> 01:16:19.020]   It's not obvious how.
[01:16:19.020 --> 01:16:20.780]   I have a bunch of sort of more detailed ideas,
[01:16:20.780 --> 01:16:22.560]   but this is fascinating
[01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:24.820]   because I've gotten a chance to talk
[01:16:24.820 --> 01:16:26.260]   to Jack Dorsey quite a bit.
[01:16:26.260 --> 01:16:27.820]   This is the CEO of Twitter.
[01:16:27.820 --> 01:16:31.940]   And he is legitimately has,
[01:16:31.940 --> 01:16:35.780]   in this conversation, he would agree with everything.
[01:16:35.780 --> 01:16:38.660]   And he's a good human being.
[01:16:38.660 --> 01:16:41.140]   And he has a lot of really good ideas how to improve things.
[01:16:41.140 --> 01:16:44.260]   The question when you're a captain of a ship,
[01:16:44.260 --> 01:16:45.940]   whether even it's a question
[01:16:45.940 --> 01:16:48.020]   whether a CEO is even a captain,
[01:16:48.020 --> 01:16:49.980]   how much can he actually steer that ship
[01:16:49.980 --> 01:16:51.400]   once it's gotten large enough?
[01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:52.400]   There's so much momentum.
[01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:53.460]   There's so many users.
[01:16:53.460 --> 01:16:57.140]   There's so many people who are marketing and PR and lawyers.
[01:16:57.140 --> 01:16:59.220]   It's very difficult to change things.
[01:16:59.220 --> 01:17:01.740]   - Is it difficult because of the fallout
[01:17:01.740 --> 01:17:03.200]   or is it difficult because it's actually
[01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:04.840]   like literally out of his power?
[01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:09.280]   - So power is weird when you have a large organization.
[01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:11.340]   This is why the great leaders,
[01:17:11.340 --> 01:17:12.780]   this is what great leaders do,
[01:17:12.780 --> 01:17:15.500]   whether it's presidents or leaders of companies.
[01:17:15.500 --> 01:17:18.420]   Steve Jobs, I would argue Musk is that way,
[01:17:18.420 --> 01:17:20.740]   is to walk into a room full of people
[01:17:20.740 --> 01:17:23.220]   who don't want you to create drama.
[01:17:23.220 --> 01:17:24.980]   It's weird, man.
[01:17:24.980 --> 01:17:27.420]   When people just kind of want to be nice,
[01:17:27.420 --> 01:17:32.140]   the niceness creates momentum and nobody wants to,
[01:17:32.140 --> 01:17:33.260]   it's the systems thing.
[01:17:33.260 --> 01:17:34.660]   Everybody just behaves in the way
[01:17:34.660 --> 01:17:36.580]   they were previously behaving
[01:17:36.580 --> 01:17:38.860]   in the way they're supposed to behave.
[01:17:38.860 --> 01:17:40.780]   And nobody wants to raise a fuss.
[01:17:40.780 --> 01:17:45.300]   It takes a great man or woman leader to step in and say,
[01:17:45.300 --> 01:17:48.380]   what we've been doing is bullshit.
[01:17:48.380 --> 01:17:50.780]   Okay, you're fired, you're cool.
[01:17:50.780 --> 01:17:51.600]   What is it?
[01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:53.140]   - Right, I'm out.
[01:17:53.140 --> 01:17:56.940]   - I think you have to create constant revolutions
[01:17:56.940 --> 01:17:57.780]   within a company.
[01:17:57.780 --> 01:17:59.780]   That's very, very difficult to do.
[01:17:59.780 --> 01:18:01.820]   Structurally and psychologically,
[01:18:01.820 --> 01:18:05.580]   it's very difficult to do to be able to sort of,
[01:18:05.580 --> 01:18:07.980]   yeah, to constantly challenge the way things
[01:18:07.980 --> 01:18:09.300]   have been done in the past.
[01:18:09.300 --> 01:18:13.300]   Which is why another way it's often done
[01:18:13.300 --> 01:18:15.380]   is a startup, like a small company,
[01:18:15.380 --> 01:18:18.300]   basically a small company becomes really successful
[01:18:18.300 --> 01:18:20.660]   and then no longer can turn the ship.
[01:18:20.660 --> 01:18:23.580]   So a new startup comes along, a new competitor
[01:18:23.580 --> 01:18:25.500]   that then challenges the big ship.
[01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:27.180]   And then that starts out the winner.
[01:18:27.180 --> 01:18:29.020]   That's like Google came to be,
[01:18:29.020 --> 01:18:31.940]   it's how Twitter came to be and Facebook and so on.
[01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:36.820]   And Apple has, that was the dream of Steve Jobs
[01:18:36.820 --> 01:18:40.860]   is it would succeed for many decades, for like centuries.
[01:18:40.860 --> 01:18:44.500]   That was the idea that you would keep creating revolutions.
[01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:48.660]   Now under Steve Jobs, Apple successfully pivoted
[01:18:48.660 --> 01:18:49.900]   a bunch of times.
[01:18:49.900 --> 01:18:51.660]   Just like reinvented themselves,
[01:18:51.660 --> 01:18:53.340]   which is very difficult to do.
[01:18:53.340 --> 01:18:54.260]   - Because I mean, I've heard,
[01:18:54.260 --> 01:18:55.540]   at least I don't know if this is accurate
[01:18:55.540 --> 01:18:56.380]   'cause I wouldn't know anything,
[01:18:56.380 --> 01:18:59.220]   but I've heard plenty of people complain about Steve Jobs.
[01:18:59.220 --> 01:19:03.100]   But in reality, the reason that all of these amazing things
[01:19:03.100 --> 01:19:05.180]   were done was because this person was willing to,
[01:19:05.180 --> 01:19:06.660]   well, obviously brilliant, and then also willing
[01:19:06.660 --> 01:19:10.060]   to rattle everyone's cage periodically and say,
[01:19:10.060 --> 01:19:13.140]   hey, what's going on is not what we need to be doing.
[01:19:13.140 --> 01:19:14.380]   - That's a really interesting thing.
[01:19:14.380 --> 01:19:17.740]   So he would rattle the cage, but he would also,
[01:19:17.740 --> 01:19:20.980]   I don't know if those are intricately connected
[01:19:20.980 --> 01:19:22.300]   or always have to be connected,
[01:19:22.300 --> 01:19:23.740]   but he would just be a dick.
[01:19:23.740 --> 01:19:25.780]   So-- - Well, maybe by my,
[01:19:25.780 --> 01:19:28.420]   maybe by his standard, I am lazy and worthless.
[01:19:28.420 --> 01:19:29.900]   - Well, that's, he would say that to you.
[01:19:29.900 --> 01:19:32.060]   - Is he being a dick though, if by his standard,
[01:19:32.060 --> 01:19:33.660]   I mean, like, again, it's like everyone's stupid
[01:19:33.660 --> 01:19:36.200]   compared to somebody, you know, I guess.
[01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:39.740]   - But so you apparently are able to take that kind of thing.
[01:19:41.460 --> 01:19:46.460]   Sometimes you just, you, there's ways to cross the line.
[01:19:46.460 --> 01:19:49.820]   And I mean, this is, okay, the fascinating thing
[01:19:49.820 --> 01:19:53.580]   about being a leader, especially a leader of companies,
[01:19:53.580 --> 01:19:55.500]   is it's a people problem.
[01:19:55.500 --> 01:19:59.140]   So each individual in a room, so as a leader,
[01:19:59.140 --> 01:20:01.780]   you're only really interacting with a small number of people
[01:20:01.780 --> 01:20:04.420]   'cause there are leaders of other smaller groups and so on.
[01:20:04.420 --> 01:20:07.220]   But each of those individuals in the room
[01:20:07.220 --> 01:20:09.580]   have their own different psychology.
[01:20:09.580 --> 01:20:11.260]   Some like to be pushed to the limit.
[01:20:11.260 --> 01:20:14.580]   Some like to be screamed at.
[01:20:14.580 --> 01:20:18.900]   Some are very soft-spoken and almost afraid to speak,
[01:20:18.900 --> 01:20:23.900]   and they have to be, you have to hear them out.
[01:20:23.900 --> 01:20:27.380]   Like, there's a, and those could be all superstars.
[01:20:27.380 --> 01:20:29.460]   We're not talking about like the C students.
[01:20:29.460 --> 01:20:31.100]   We're talking about the A plus students.
[01:20:31.100 --> 01:20:32.980]   - Well, it's funny that, yeah, but the thing to,
[01:20:32.980 --> 01:20:34.700]   the skill to manage all of those people
[01:20:34.700 --> 01:20:37.900]   is completely separate from the skill to innovate something.
[01:20:37.900 --> 01:20:39.160]   I mean, not that they're not connected,
[01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:41.380]   but it's funny how it's, it's almost like,
[01:20:41.380 --> 01:20:44.180]   why do we have shitty representatives?
[01:20:44.180 --> 01:20:45.140]   - Yeah. - Well, I mean,
[01:20:45.140 --> 01:20:46.700]   the thing that you do to get elected
[01:20:46.700 --> 01:20:48.100]   has nothing to do with governance.
[01:20:48.100 --> 01:20:49.180]   - Yes. - You know, so.
[01:20:49.180 --> 01:20:50.020]   - Well, that's exactly it,
[01:20:50.020 --> 01:20:52.660]   but the great leaders have to have both skills.
[01:20:52.660 --> 01:20:55.140]   So like, you have to have the boldness of,
[01:20:55.140 --> 01:20:59.500]   if you look at the great presidents through history,
[01:20:59.500 --> 01:21:03.100]   usually it's in a time of crisis is when they step up,
[01:21:03.100 --> 01:21:05.220]   but they basically say, okay,
[01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:10.240]   stop this old way that Congress works of this bickering,
[01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:12.400]   of this like compromise bullshit.
[01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:15.240]   Here's a huge plan that costs billions of dollars
[01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:18.100]   in today's age, trillions of dollars,
[01:21:18.100 --> 01:21:20.280]   no extra pork, no extra additions,
[01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:22.800]   just like here's a clear plan.
[01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:26.240]   We're going to build the best road network
[01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:27.640]   the world has ever seen.
[01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:30.000]   We're going to build some huge infrastructure project.
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.200]   We're going to revolutionize internet,
[01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:34.560]   or we're going to, for coronavirus,
[01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:36.880]   we're going to build the largest like testing facility
[01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:38.760]   the world has ever seen in terms of the,
[01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:42.120]   we're going to get everybody tested several times a day,
[01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:43.880]   all those kinds of things, huge projects,
[01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:47.080]   and say, fuck all this,
[01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:48.940]   the details that everybody's bickering about.
[01:21:48.940 --> 01:21:51.360]   We're going to give everybody $2,000.
[01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:54.800]   We're going to give everybody $3,000, like huge projects.
[01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:56.680]   And at the same time, so that's the boldness
[01:21:56.680 --> 01:21:57.960]   and the leadership of saying,
[01:21:57.960 --> 01:22:01.120]   throw out all the bullshit of the past.
[01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:04.800]   And at the same time, be able to get in the room
[01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:06.280]   with the leaders of both parties
[01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:08.280]   or with the powerful individuals
[01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:10.360]   and smooth talk the shit out of them
[01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:12.520]   in the way they need to be smooth talked to.
[01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:14.440]   So like both of those skills,
[01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:16.400]   it seems to be when they're combined in one person,
[01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:19.000]   that creates great leaders.
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.020]   Musk appears to have that, Elon.
[01:22:21.020 --> 01:22:23.520]   I don't know if Steve Jobs.
[01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:27.000]   It's interesting, so the criticism of Steve
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.840]   and a little bit on Elon is he misses
[01:22:28.840 --> 01:22:31.560]   some of the human part,
[01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:35.160]   but maybe it's impossible to have a really,
[01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:37.920]   you have like Saliha Nadal, who's the CEO of Microsoft.
[01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:41.560]   You have, who's really good on the human side,
[01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:43.000]   really, really good on the human side.
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:44.840]   Like everybody loves him.
[01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:49.220]   The CEO of Google and Alphabet is also the same way.
[01:22:49.220 --> 01:22:51.880]   So like, I don't know if it's possible to have both.
[01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:54.800]   - You only get so many stat points.
[01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:58.240]   - Yeah, you only get in this RPG of life, yeah.
[01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:02.420]   - You got very good at Jiu-Jitsu very fast.
[01:23:02.420 --> 01:23:05.520]   So you went, I mean, you told the story of Blue Belt
[01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:09.120]   and so on, but you went to Black Belt really quickly
[01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:10.720]   and not just in terms of ranks,
[01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:12.720]   but in terms of just skill level.
[01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:15.760]   I mean, you didn't go to Black Belt nearly as fast
[01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:17.920]   as your skill set developed.
[01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:19.660]   You were like doing extremely well
[01:23:19.660 --> 01:23:21.520]   at a high level of competition.
[01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:24.240]   So you're a good person to ask,
[01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:26.720]   how does one get good at Jiu-Jitsu?
[01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:29.200]   We talked about solving problems at the elite level,
[01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:33.360]   but when you're a beginner at the martial arts,
[01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:34.760]   how do you get good?
[01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:36.440]   How much training should you do?
[01:23:36.440 --> 01:23:38.480]   The very basic stuff, like how much training,
[01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:41.000]   how much drilling, and then the mental stuff,
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:45.000]   like where should your mind be?
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:48.240]   How should you approach it from a mental perspective too?
[01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:49.880]   - I'll just tell you my perspective on this one.
[01:23:49.880 --> 01:23:52.400]   I guess I would say, I feel, step one,
[01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:56.440]   I feel lucky to have found a good training situation,
[01:23:56.440 --> 01:24:01.360]   particularly for the time, in where I was at.
[01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:04.080]   And I drilled a ton.
[01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:06.680]   I drilled and drilled and drilled and drilled and drilled.
[01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:10.460]   And one thing that's really important to understand though,
[01:24:10.460 --> 01:24:13.520]   is that I was able to,
[01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:15.840]   in a relatively brief period of years,
[01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:18.180]   go from zero to reasonably good.
[01:24:18.180 --> 01:24:21.760]   But I think I probably crammed more hours
[01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:25.560]   in those small years than most people did
[01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:28.560]   training, let's say, in two or three times the length.
[01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:31.720]   So it may masquerade as something else
[01:24:31.720 --> 01:24:33.200]   other than it is, I could say.
[01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:34.560]   - So you have to put in the hours.
[01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:35.880]   - Yeah. - There's no way around that.
[01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:36.720]   - I think so.
[01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:38.040]   - But what did you put in those hours?
[01:24:38.040 --> 01:24:39.640]   So when you said drilling,
[01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:41.120]   can you break that apart a little bit?
[01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:42.760]   What does drilling look like?
[01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:44.040]   Is there any recommendations you can make?
[01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:47.320]   - Absolutely, step one, I would say your choices matter.
[01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:49.080]   I think one of the really important things
[01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:50.920]   that I think we should consider about jujitsu
[01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:52.720]   is that there's a lot of junk in the system right now.
[01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:56.200]   It's like jujitsu has exploded in terms of
[01:24:56.200 --> 01:24:58.320]   the number of positions, techniques, strategies,
[01:24:58.320 --> 01:24:59.980]   this, that, rule sets.
[01:24:59.980 --> 01:25:01.520]   That's really cool on the one hand.
[01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:05.860]   On the other hand, there's probably a just metric shit ton
[01:25:05.860 --> 01:25:08.600]   of suboptimal things that are out there
[01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:09.720]   that are being taught.
[01:25:09.720 --> 01:25:12.520]   Myself included, I've taught things
[01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:14.040]   that are looking back five years, three years,
[01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:15.120]   two years, one year, where I'm like,
[01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:16.920]   oh, I would not do it like that anymore.
[01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:18.480]   Straight up, sometimes I wouldn't do it like that.
[01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:20.460]   Other times I would literally never do
[01:25:20.460 --> 01:25:22.080]   even that particular movement.
[01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:24.760]   I don't think the shrimp is a real move.
[01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:28.880]   It's a giant spiel and it's easier to show in person,
[01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:30.300]   but long story, there's a lot of things
[01:25:30.300 --> 01:25:32.080]   that we think of as fundamental
[01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:35.360]   that I think that are really pretty negative.
[01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:36.760]   And also--
[01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:38.400]   - That's heresy in jujitsu, isn't it?
[01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:42.560]   The shrimp is like the holy, we all worship the shrimp.
[01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:44.680]   - We love the shrimp, we love the shrimp.
[01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:46.600]   - Now, for people who don't do jujitsu,
[01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:50.720]   and you should, the shrimp is, you scoot your butt.
[01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:53.960]   - Away from your opponent.
[01:25:53.960 --> 01:25:54.800]   - Yeah, and it's really--
[01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:55.640]   - How would you describe that?
[01:25:55.640 --> 01:25:57.720]   - It's like a really athletic looking position
[01:25:57.720 --> 01:25:59.320]   where you look like someone that's trying
[01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:01.000]   to stick their butt out on Instagram,
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:04.200]   and then you push your hands away and you expose your face,
[01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:06.000]   and then you lay on your side
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.460]   because someone told you to do that.
[01:26:08.460 --> 01:26:12.760]   - And you look like a, I guess you look like a shrimp.
[01:26:12.760 --> 01:26:15.640]   - Yeah, it's like that time that someone really credible
[01:26:15.640 --> 01:26:17.120]   told me to drink unleaded gasoline,
[01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:18.280]   and I did it for a while.
[01:26:18.280 --> 01:26:20.440]   And then it got to the point in my life
[01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:22.640]   where the next best, the thing that I needed to do
[01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:23.800]   to really improve my life
[01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:26.520]   was stop drinking unleaded gasoline.
[01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:29.040]   And I would say that there's a lot of stuff
[01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:31.340]   that's in there that step one is like,
[01:26:31.340 --> 01:26:34.160]   it's junk, it's actual junk.
[01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:37.640]   And it's, not only will it waste your time,
[01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:41.080]   it will straight up, it will be like an albatross
[01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:43.040]   hanging on you because it affects
[01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:44.660]   how you think about things going forward.
[01:26:44.660 --> 01:26:49.200]   So although, it's funny, the operating assumptions
[01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:53.600]   that we work under have a huge, huge, huge influence.
[01:26:53.600 --> 01:26:55.280]   You mentioned like growing up in the United States
[01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:58.160]   or this being a capitalist society, like, woohoo, all right.
[01:26:58.160 --> 01:26:59.160]   Now, of course, I think that.
[01:26:59.160 --> 01:27:00.880]   I don't really know any different otherwise.
[01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:02.320]   And I think that a lot of times people go,
[01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:03.600]   oh, communism is better.
[01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:05.000]   I'm like, haven't seen it.
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:06.800]   Haven't read any books about it being better,
[01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:08.080]   but it's possible.
[01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:10.700]   I mean, I haven't experienced it much myself either.
[01:27:10.700 --> 01:27:12.560]   So I can't dismiss it outright.
[01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:14.360]   But I guess I would say it's a fundamentally
[01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:17.180]   differing operating system underpinning
[01:27:17.180 --> 01:27:18.980]   and all of my choices, all of,
[01:27:18.980 --> 01:27:21.360]   if I honestly believed in that thing,
[01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:23.780]   many of my choices on a moment by moment,
[01:27:23.780 --> 01:27:26.160]   on a day by day, and certainly on a lifetime basis,
[01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:27.160]   would be very different.
[01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:31.060]   So I would say that it's tough when you're young
[01:27:31.060 --> 01:27:32.040]   in the martial arts.
[01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:33.160]   And I mean, all of us are always trying
[01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:34.040]   to do our best to learn.
[01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:35.280]   But when you're young in the martial arts,
[01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:37.060]   you always go, if you're a reasonable guy,
[01:27:37.060 --> 01:27:37.900]   what do they call it?
[01:27:37.900 --> 01:27:38.800]   Like Dunning-Kruger amnesia.
[01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:39.640]   I can't remember if this is the right one.
[01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:42.820]   But basically you go like, oh, I know what I'm doing here.
[01:27:42.820 --> 01:27:44.120]   So I can say that's not right.
[01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:46.360]   But then I read a news story about baseball,
[01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:48.120]   I don't know anything about baseball, sounds credible.
[01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:49.980]   And it's bullshit.
[01:27:49.980 --> 01:27:50.980]   But I can't call bullshit.
[01:27:50.980 --> 01:27:51.820]   If you're a reasonable person,
[01:27:51.820 --> 01:27:53.480]   you can't call bullshit on things that you don't understand.
[01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:54.840]   Even if you suspect it's not right,
[01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:57.000]   you're like, well, I've got to reserve judgment.
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:01.320]   You never, ever, ever set aside your need
[01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:03.440]   and also obligation to understand
[01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:04.640]   why you were doing what you're doing.
[01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:07.880]   And don't ask why once, ask why over and over and over
[01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:09.360]   and over about the same thing.
[01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:10.520]   Oh, well, I want a shrimp.
[01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:11.340]   Why?
[01:28:11.340 --> 01:28:12.180]   To make space.
[01:28:12.180 --> 01:28:13.000]   Why do I want to make space?
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:13.840]   To get away from the guy.
[01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:15.120]   Well, why do I want to get away from him?
[01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:16.080]   Well, because he's dangerous.
[01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:17.040]   Well, why is he dangerous?
[01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:18.400]   And you can oftentimes get down to,
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:20.080]   wait a minute, I didn't even need to move.
[01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:20.920]   Three quarters of the time,
[01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:23.080]   you're actually acting in the other person's self-interest.
[01:28:23.080 --> 01:28:24.320]   And I guess a lot of times I can't,
[01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:27.400]   this kind of goes beyond what we can demonstrate here.
[01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:28.880]   But I would just say,
[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:31.920]   trying to understand what my base operating assumptions are
[01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:33.560]   and consistently reevaluate them,
[01:28:33.560 --> 01:28:35.280]   which can be fricking exhausting, frankly,
[01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:37.400]   and also comes on as confidence destroying.
[01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:40.680]   But you mentioned that I did pretty well relatively quickly.
[01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:43.640]   I was at, I started in 2004,
[01:28:43.640 --> 01:28:46.240]   and I was at Abu Dhabi ADCC for the first time
[01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:48.600]   as an alternate in 2007.
[01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:51.680]   I won a match there against a Black Belt World Champion.
[01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:53.000]   And the fact, frankly,
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.280]   the fact that I was able to beat someone like that was neat,
[01:28:55.280 --> 01:28:56.760]   but at the same time says a little bit more
[01:28:56.760 --> 01:29:01.040]   about what Jiu-Jitsu is and some of the issues with it
[01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:03.620]   than it does about how cool I am or was,
[01:29:03.620 --> 01:29:08.360]   because that shouldn't really happen
[01:29:08.360 --> 01:29:09.200]   when you think about it.
[01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:10.600]   You're like, okay, you're a champion
[01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:14.280]   at ostensibly a very high level of the sport.
[01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:17.920]   You enjoy a three inch, four inch height advantage
[01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:21.320]   and a 35 pound weight advantage, and you just got beat.
[01:29:21.320 --> 01:29:22.800]   Like that should not exist.
[01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:24.920]   I'm serious, I'm dead serious that should not exist.
[01:29:24.920 --> 01:29:26.440]   If that happens, you're doing it wrong.
[01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:27.640]   Is it that I'm doing it right
[01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:28.760]   or is it that you're doing it wrong
[01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:31.960]   and there's enough variance in the way that you're doing it
[01:29:31.960 --> 01:29:34.280]   that you're allowing me to win?
[01:29:34.280 --> 01:29:36.520]   And now I did happen to win that with the 50/50 heel hook,
[01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:38.600]   which was, 50/50,
[01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:42.400]   but basically which was one of the early examples of like,
[01:29:42.400 --> 01:29:45.560]   hey guys, by the way, people can try to hurt your legs.
[01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:47.560]   And that was something like we mentioned John Danaher,
[01:29:47.560 --> 01:29:49.680]   mentioned like myself, Dean Lister,
[01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:51.160]   a lot of the guys from the Henzo Gracie team
[01:29:51.160 --> 01:29:52.400]   that have had amazing success.
[01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:54.680]   They've gone and done great things.
[01:29:54.680 --> 01:29:57.040]   Craig Jones in the competitive grappling world,
[01:29:57.040 --> 01:29:59.520]   basically taking advantage of being very, very good
[01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:02.080]   in what they're doing, but also a glaring, glaring,
[01:30:02.080 --> 01:30:04.760]   glaring issue with the operating system of Jiu-Jitsu,
[01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:08.480]   which was a huge vulnerability in the lower body
[01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:09.960]   and not only not attacking it,
[01:30:09.960 --> 01:30:12.280]   but having no idea how one does attack it,
[01:30:12.280 --> 01:30:13.520]   which means you can't understand
[01:30:13.520 --> 01:30:15.000]   how someone will assail you.
[01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:20.000]   So anyway, I guess to come back is if in the absence
[01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.520]   of knowing what to do, I try to polish what I've got.
[01:30:22.520 --> 01:30:23.560]   So if I've got a knife and I'm like,
[01:30:23.560 --> 01:30:24.400]   I don't know how to use them,
[01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:26.160]   like, okay, I'm just gonna sharpen the edge and polish it
[01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:27.960]   and make sure that when I need to use this dang thing,
[01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:29.240]   I'll be able to do it.
[01:30:29.240 --> 01:30:31.720]   Because trying to put together a system
[01:30:31.720 --> 01:30:34.280]   when you don't have an idea of what's going on,
[01:30:34.280 --> 01:30:37.240]   a lot of times you end up making suboptimal choices,
[01:30:37.240 --> 01:30:39.280]   but as long as you're consistently re-evaluating
[01:30:39.280 --> 01:30:40.800]   what you're doing, and that's something I've tried to do
[01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:42.640]   over time, over and over and over again,
[01:30:42.640 --> 01:30:46.240]   and try to seek out the most,
[01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:50.040]   the best and also most articulate
[01:30:50.040 --> 01:30:53.240]   or insightful instructors or people of various levels,
[01:30:53.240 --> 01:30:54.600]   doesn't matter if they're well-known or not,
[01:30:54.600 --> 01:30:56.400]   that could say, hey, Ryan, I think you should do this,
[01:30:56.400 --> 01:30:57.440]   I think you should do that.
[01:30:57.440 --> 01:30:59.920]   And I think all I've ever done in martial arts
[01:30:59.920 --> 01:31:02.280]   is try to treat people with respect, honestly,
[01:31:02.280 --> 01:31:05.680]   try to demonstrate appreciation for the many, many people
[01:31:05.680 --> 01:31:07.840]   who have helped me over time and be the type of person
[01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:09.760]   that they wanna train with, not the type of,
[01:31:09.760 --> 01:31:10.840]   'cause we've all trained with people
[01:31:10.840 --> 01:31:12.320]   that make us think about beating
[01:31:12.320 --> 01:31:13.960]   the ever-loving crap out of them.
[01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:15.240]   I never wanted to be that guy.
[01:31:15.240 --> 01:31:16.080]   And I was basically saying,
[01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:18.400]   like if I train with a black belt when I'm a blue belt
[01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:21.560]   and this person enjoys training with me,
[01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:22.480]   that's in my interest.
[01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:24.520]   Selfishly, not only do I not want them to beat me up,
[01:31:24.520 --> 01:31:25.440]   but selfishly, I should,
[01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:26.920]   you mentioned being decent to other people,
[01:31:26.920 --> 01:31:29.040]   you wanna incentivize being decent to other people, right,
[01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:31.040]   with the structure of what you're doing.
[01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:33.800]   Selfishly, I'm incentivized to be a nice guy,
[01:31:33.800 --> 01:31:35.640]   even if I'm internally a scumbag,
[01:31:35.640 --> 01:31:36.960]   which I like to think that I'm not,
[01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:38.240]   but basically going like,
[01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:40.120]   hey, this guy's way more likely to help me,
[01:31:40.120 --> 01:31:41.480]   or this person's way more likely to help me
[01:31:41.480 --> 01:31:43.320]   if I shake their hand, say thank you,
[01:31:43.320 --> 01:31:44.640]   I really appreciate you helping me out.
[01:31:44.640 --> 01:31:48.040]   And that thing that they tap me with four or five times,
[01:31:48.040 --> 01:31:49.360]   I'm gonna ask them about it.
[01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:50.320]   And then they don't have to tell me,
[01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:51.320]   they're under no obligation,
[01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:53.000]   but I'll say, and whether they tell me or don't,
[01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:54.920]   thank you so much for your time, really appreciate it.
[01:31:54.920 --> 01:31:57.400]   And that's it.
[01:31:57.400 --> 01:31:58.480]   - Okay, so to summarize,
[01:31:58.480 --> 01:32:01.000]   so the way you brilliantly described it,
[01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:01.840]   I just wanna make sure we're keeping track of this.
[01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:03.600]   - Sorry, I went all over the place.
[01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:05.880]   - No, you didn't, you're pretty on point.
[01:32:05.880 --> 01:32:08.480]   But so the first thing is basically,
[01:32:08.480 --> 01:32:09.440]   which is difficult,
[01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:11.400]   I wonder if we can break it apart a little bit,
[01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:14.800]   is don't trust authority, essentially, keep asking why.
[01:32:14.800 --> 01:32:16.680]   - Be respectful without trusting authority, right?
[01:32:16.680 --> 01:32:18.320]   - Right, which is, and then the second thing
[01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:21.560]   is be the kind of person that others like training with,
[01:32:21.560 --> 01:32:26.560]   or like being around, sort of being a good friend.
[01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:28.960]   So many people just enjoy being around.
[01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:31.640]   So one is complete, which is, yeah, you're right,
[01:32:31.640 --> 01:32:34.920]   it's attention, which is like completely disrespect
[01:32:34.920 --> 01:32:37.940]   the way that things are done.
[01:32:37.940 --> 01:32:40.240]   So asking why constantly.
[01:32:40.240 --> 01:32:42.680]   One of it is your own flaws and not understanding
[01:32:42.680 --> 01:32:44.760]   the fundamentals of what's being described.
[01:32:44.760 --> 01:32:47.640]   And then once you get good enough, not understanding,
[01:32:47.640 --> 01:32:51.320]   like going against the fact
[01:32:51.320 --> 01:32:53.800]   that the instructor doesn't understand.
[01:32:53.800 --> 01:32:55.840]   - And my inability to understand what you're saying,
[01:32:55.840 --> 01:32:56.960]   though, doesn't invalidate it.
[01:32:56.960 --> 01:32:58.040]   And that's something like you mentioned,
[01:32:58.040 --> 01:33:00.960]   like keeping in mind our own flaws,
[01:33:00.960 --> 01:33:03.000]   and then also, again, the flaws that any of us have
[01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:04.360]   as the instructor, to your point.
[01:33:04.360 --> 01:33:07.040]   And I guess I can speak to being kind of weird.
[01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:09.600]   I don't, you know, I like to sit in the corner.
[01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:12.080]   But, so everyone's a little bit different.
[01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:14.000]   Some people, you know, I wasn't terribly popular
[01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:14.840]   in high school.
[01:33:14.840 --> 01:33:18.280]   I, you know, I didn't like high school very much.
[01:33:18.280 --> 01:33:20.960]   But anyway, yeah, I would not gonna be rude to people,
[01:33:20.960 --> 01:33:23.040]   though, I was never gonna bully anybody.
[01:33:23.040 --> 01:33:25.040]   If you said hello to me, I'd say hello back.
[01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:27.240]   I would hold the door for you if you walked by, you know?
[01:33:27.240 --> 01:33:29.800]   And I would just say like simple things like that
[01:33:29.800 --> 01:33:31.720]   go a long, long, long way.
[01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:35.480]   And that actually takes us back to our social discussion,
[01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:37.720]   where I'm like, oh man, how do I become great at jujitsu?
[01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:40.440]   It's like, well, I'll start by not pissing off this person
[01:33:40.440 --> 01:33:42.000]   who can beat the crap out of me,
[01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:45.400]   and not disrespecting the person who is probably
[01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:47.840]   the closest thing to a font of knowledge
[01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:49.040]   at that time for me.
[01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:52.360]   So, and then recognizing that I should do that
[01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:54.320]   for its own virtue, because it's the right thing to do,
[01:33:54.320 --> 01:33:55.760]   and I should try to treat people decently.
[01:33:55.760 --> 01:33:58.040]   But beyond that, even selfishly,
[01:33:58.040 --> 01:33:59.520]   it's in my interest to do that.
[01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:02.520]   - But see, the thing is, this is interesting,
[01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:06.520]   is there's a culture in martial arts,
[01:34:06.520 --> 01:34:08.920]   a culture that I like, where the instructor,
[01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:13.920]   legitimately so, carries an aura of authority.
[01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:18.160]   And it's not comfortable to really ask why.
[01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:22.760]   It's a skill to be able to have a discussion
[01:34:22.760 --> 01:34:26.160]   as a white belt, the black belt instructor,
[01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:28.520]   of like, why is it done this way?
[01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:31.520]   Like, and saying why again.
[01:34:31.520 --> 01:34:35.200]   Like, I mean, it's a skill to show
[01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:37.720]   that you're actually legitimately a curious,
[01:34:37.720 --> 01:34:40.800]   and passionate, and compassionate student,
[01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:43.560]   versus like, somebody who's just being an annoying dick
[01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:45.200]   who saw some stuff on YouTube.
[01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:47.880]   There's a line between, to walk there.
[01:34:47.880 --> 01:34:52.440]   I just wonder, because like, it's the drilling thing.
[01:34:52.440 --> 01:34:58.820]   For example, like in my, when I was coming up,
[01:34:58.820 --> 01:35:00.860]   there was so much emphasis placed on like,
[01:35:00.860 --> 01:35:02.240]   close guard, for example.
[01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:07.540]   And you might actually teach me now, I don't know.
[01:35:07.540 --> 01:35:11.900]   But to me, it was like, why do I need to master
[01:35:11.900 --> 01:35:15.280]   the close guard, like, why is the close guard
[01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:17.720]   on top or the bottom, but the bottom really,
[01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:20.280]   this is the fundamental basics of Jiu Jitsu.
[01:35:20.280 --> 01:35:21.280]   - Who decided that?
[01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:25.120]   - My body is not, my body says this is wrong.
[01:35:26.920 --> 01:35:28.940]   Like, I have short legs, but it doesn't even matter
[01:35:28.940 --> 01:35:30.220]   the length of legs.
[01:35:30.220 --> 01:35:31.900]   There's something about me that just,
[01:35:31.900 --> 01:35:34.380]   I don't understand how leverage here works
[01:35:34.380 --> 01:35:37.820]   for my particular body.
[01:35:37.820 --> 01:35:40.900]   So, it's just, it's a feel thing, too.
[01:35:40.900 --> 01:35:45.100]   Like, it feels like, in my basic understanding
[01:35:45.100 --> 01:35:48.020]   of leverage, and movement, and timing, and so on,
[01:35:48.020 --> 01:35:50.260]   it feels like these certain, like, butterfly guard,
[01:35:50.260 --> 01:35:53.180]   or even like, basically every guard except close guard.
[01:35:53.180 --> 01:35:56.300]   I can play, I can dance.
[01:35:56.300 --> 01:36:00.900]   - Close guard feels like you're shutting down,
[01:36:00.900 --> 01:36:02.940]   like, the play that I--
[01:36:02.940 --> 01:36:06.480]   - Is that wrong, or is that, make sure that's what you want,
[01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:08.660]   because that's almost like an innate characteristic
[01:36:08.660 --> 01:36:11.020]   of this guard position, but it's not sold that way, right?
[01:36:11.020 --> 01:36:12.880]   It's like, hey, this is a good guard.
[01:36:12.880 --> 01:36:15.700]   It's like, hey, man, here's a bow and arrow,
[01:36:15.700 --> 01:36:17.660]   versus, and you know how to use this thing, right?
[01:36:17.660 --> 01:36:19.500]   Like, make sure you're far away,
[01:36:19.500 --> 01:36:21.140]   and like, up on a hill or something.
[01:36:21.140 --> 01:36:22.060]   'Cause you can take that bow and arrow,
[01:36:22.060 --> 01:36:24.580]   run up on something, and try to use it.
[01:36:24.580 --> 01:36:27.140]   But if nobody told you not to do that,
[01:36:27.140 --> 01:36:28.420]   and they told you it was foundational,
[01:36:28.420 --> 01:36:29.740]   it's very foundational, it's very important.
[01:36:29.740 --> 01:36:31.620]   - To everything else, too, right?
[01:36:31.620 --> 01:36:33.380]   - That's back to the shrimping thing.
[01:36:33.380 --> 01:36:35.860]   How many things are we taught that even if it's not,
[01:36:35.860 --> 01:36:39.140]   let's say, itself is not a garbage thing,
[01:36:39.140 --> 01:36:41.980]   might be effectively garbage.
[01:36:41.980 --> 01:36:45.220]   You could give me a Ferrari, but if I try to make it fly,
[01:36:45.220 --> 01:36:46.820]   it's not gonna work.
[01:36:46.820 --> 01:36:48.780]   If you're like, here's a plane, here's another plane,
[01:36:48.780 --> 01:36:50.140]   here's another plane, here's another plane,
[01:36:50.140 --> 01:36:51.060]   here's a Ferrari, I'm like, oh,
[01:36:51.060 --> 01:36:52.580]   it must be a different type of plane.
[01:36:52.580 --> 01:36:54.980]   Like, you could be forgiven for leaping, for going there.
[01:36:54.980 --> 01:36:56.220]   You know, like, oh, maybe the wings come out,
[01:36:56.220 --> 01:36:57.900]   or you just go fast enough, it's like a bullet.
[01:36:57.900 --> 01:36:59.700]   You can make these crazy leaps in your mind,
[01:36:59.700 --> 01:37:02.540]   and people are doing that all the time.
[01:37:02.540 --> 01:37:05.140]   So if you don't provide the context for me,
[01:37:05.140 --> 01:37:08.060]   or worse yet, you provide improper context,
[01:37:08.060 --> 01:37:10.900]   like, how much of a problem is that gonna be?
[01:37:10.900 --> 01:37:14.340]   - Well, I think the skill of the white belt should be,
[01:37:14.340 --> 01:37:15.700]   just be nice.
[01:37:15.700 --> 01:37:20.300]   But in the complicated human space of when your intention,
[01:37:20.300 --> 01:37:23.940]   at least in the big picture view, is good.
[01:37:23.940 --> 01:37:28.740]   The question is, it's not always when your intention is good
[01:37:28.740 --> 01:37:32.780]   the actual implementation of it is good.
[01:37:32.780 --> 01:37:36.140]   So you might be just almost, and that's much,
[01:37:36.140 --> 01:37:37.300]   it's not the case for you,
[01:37:37.300 --> 01:37:39.260]   it's much more the case for white belts.
[01:37:39.260 --> 01:37:41.620]   They don't even know, their intention might be good,
[01:37:41.620 --> 01:37:43.940]   but they don't know all the lines they're crossing,
[01:37:43.940 --> 01:37:46.420]   all the, so they're not actually able to,
[01:37:46.420 --> 01:37:50.220]   and interpret all the ways in which
[01:37:50.220 --> 01:37:53.260]   they're being totally insensitive to the requests of others,
[01:37:53.260 --> 01:37:55.100]   like explicit requests of others.
[01:37:55.100 --> 01:37:59.660]   So your job as a beginner is to be a really good listener
[01:37:59.660 --> 01:38:01.260]   of those social cues.
[01:38:01.260 --> 01:38:02.900]   - It's like a visitor in a foreign country, right?
[01:38:02.900 --> 01:38:03.740]   - Yeah.
[01:38:03.740 --> 01:38:04.820]   - Like you're a representative of people
[01:38:04.820 --> 01:38:06.660]   that look like you, people that talk like you,
[01:38:06.660 --> 01:38:07.940]   people that have your passport,
[01:38:07.940 --> 01:38:09.220]   and you're like, man, I'm gonna go over here,
[01:38:09.220 --> 01:38:10.800]   oh, I've got my foot up on my knee.
[01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:12.020]   Well, if I was in a certain country in the world,
[01:38:12.020 --> 01:38:12.980]   that's rude.
[01:38:12.980 --> 01:38:14.620]   I'm like, oh, I'm so sorry.
[01:38:14.620 --> 01:38:15.740]   But can you imagine if someone says,
[01:38:15.740 --> 01:38:17.740]   hey, I really appreciate if you take your foot off,
[01:38:17.740 --> 01:38:18.580]   that's pretty rude.
[01:38:18.580 --> 01:38:21.420]   And then I wanna tell them, well, not where I'm from, man.
[01:38:21.420 --> 01:38:22.400]   I'm in your house.
[01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:24.700]   I better, again, I might go that direction,
[01:38:24.700 --> 01:38:25.900]   but let's say I could get away with that.
[01:38:25.900 --> 01:38:27.060]   Now I'm a bully.
[01:38:27.060 --> 01:38:28.540]   And if I can't get away with that,
[01:38:28.540 --> 01:38:30.860]   well, I'm about to maybe be on the wrong side of something.
[01:38:30.860 --> 01:38:33.180]   But I guess, like you said,
[01:38:33.180 --> 01:38:34.740]   if we have positive intention, that's fine.
[01:38:34.740 --> 01:38:36.060]   But I also have to recognize who I am.
[01:38:36.060 --> 01:38:39.020]   And I think that that's one thing that I tried to do
[01:38:39.020 --> 01:38:40.860]   and continue to try to do over time.
[01:38:40.860 --> 01:38:43.340]   Like we're, oh man, hi,
[01:38:43.340 --> 01:38:45.220]   I'm the one that's asking for a favor here.
[01:38:45.220 --> 01:38:46.580]   If I spar with Raymond Daniels,
[01:38:46.580 --> 01:38:48.460]   Raymond Daniels is doing me a favor.
[01:38:48.460 --> 01:38:49.780]   I ain't doing him a favor.
[01:38:49.780 --> 01:38:51.280]   Let's not get it twisted.
[01:38:51.280 --> 01:38:53.220]   So thank you so much for your time.
[01:38:53.220 --> 01:38:54.060]   I really appreciate it.
[01:38:54.060 --> 01:38:56.140]   These are not, and this is not like some affected nonsense.
[01:38:56.140 --> 01:38:56.980]   This is serious.
[01:38:56.980 --> 01:38:57.800]   I'm like, thank you.
[01:38:57.800 --> 01:38:58.900]   If I spar with Stephen Thompson,
[01:38:58.900 --> 01:39:00.060]   I'm the one being done a favor.
[01:39:00.060 --> 01:39:01.660]   George St. Pierre takes his time to spar with me,
[01:39:01.660 --> 01:39:04.040]   which he has in the past, and not even kill me,
[01:39:04.040 --> 01:39:05.500]   which is really, I appreciate that
[01:39:05.500 --> 01:39:07.840]   'cause that's why I can sit here.
[01:39:07.840 --> 01:39:11.580]   George is not a prop for me to get my rocks off
[01:39:11.580 --> 01:39:12.600]   or see what's going on.
[01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:14.060]   And also I'm gonna do that
[01:39:14.060 --> 01:39:16.380]   and then expect him to just take it.
[01:39:16.380 --> 01:39:17.720]   And I've seen, he's a gentleman.
[01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:19.140]   I've seen people get nuts with George
[01:39:19.140 --> 01:39:20.500]   and have him just be like,
[01:39:20.500 --> 01:39:23.720]   he's a patient of a saint.
[01:39:23.720 --> 01:39:24.800]   I don't have that level of patience,
[01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:26.660]   but I would just say to come back,
[01:39:26.660 --> 01:39:28.980]   figuring out like, hey, so what role am I here?
[01:39:28.980 --> 01:39:30.140]   And that comes back to like,
[01:39:30.140 --> 01:39:31.760]   at least what I see people on the internet.
[01:39:31.760 --> 01:39:33.660]   Yeah, man, I have a beef with Joe Rogan.
[01:39:33.660 --> 01:39:35.100]   You're like, no, you don't, Ryan.
[01:39:35.100 --> 01:39:36.380]   You're some goof.
[01:39:36.380 --> 01:39:37.660]   I'm like, I'm some random dude.
[01:39:37.660 --> 01:39:39.140]   Joe, like people want it.
[01:39:39.140 --> 01:39:40.340]   They almost want to like elevate
[01:39:40.340 --> 01:39:42.900]   so that we can somehow be level or peers here.
[01:39:42.900 --> 01:39:44.500]   If I go into Firas Zahabi's gym,
[01:39:44.500 --> 01:39:45.860]   I'm not a peer of Firas Zahabi.
[01:39:45.860 --> 01:39:47.300]   I am a student of TriStar.
[01:39:47.300 --> 01:39:48.780]   I'm a guest in the academy.
[01:39:48.780 --> 01:39:51.180]   And if Firas asked me for something short of him,
[01:39:51.180 --> 01:39:53.380]   like, telling me to try to do a triple backflip
[01:39:53.380 --> 01:39:55.780]   so I break my neck, the answer is yes, sir.
[01:39:55.780 --> 01:39:56.620]   I can do it for you, Firas.
[01:39:56.620 --> 01:39:57.460]   No, man, no worries.
[01:39:57.460 --> 01:39:59.100]   And hopefully it should come with,
[01:39:59.100 --> 01:40:00.900]   I guess, a level of graciousness.
[01:40:00.900 --> 01:40:02.300]   But I guess that's kind of one of the things
[01:40:02.300 --> 01:40:04.860]   that I see nowadays with how accessible people are.
[01:40:04.860 --> 01:40:07.380]   'Cause I grew up being a big, huge baseball sports fan
[01:40:07.380 --> 01:40:08.540]   of all kinds.
[01:40:08.540 --> 01:40:10.940]   I couldn't send Derek Jeter a message
[01:40:10.940 --> 01:40:14.700]   and much less have a possibility of a reply.
[01:40:14.700 --> 01:40:16.220]   And if I do, it's like,
[01:40:16.220 --> 01:40:18.740]   you know, I have people send me messages.
[01:40:18.740 --> 01:40:20.100]   It's very nice that people send me messages.
[01:40:20.100 --> 01:40:21.980]   Some people, again, not everyone
[01:40:21.980 --> 01:40:23.580]   is coming from the same place.
[01:40:23.580 --> 01:40:25.140]   But I've had plenty of things that are like,
[01:40:25.140 --> 01:40:26.900]   yo, dude, I need you to do this for me.
[01:40:26.900 --> 01:40:29.620]   I'm like, well, I'll tell you what's never gonna happen.
[01:40:29.620 --> 01:40:30.460]   That.
[01:40:30.460 --> 01:40:31.340]   I have no idea who you are.
[01:40:31.340 --> 01:40:32.820]   And that was how I was addressed.
[01:40:32.820 --> 01:40:34.620]   And I don't need, oh man, you're the greatest,
[01:40:34.620 --> 01:40:35.580]   one, because that's weird,
[01:40:35.580 --> 01:40:36.620]   and two, 'cause I'm not.
[01:40:36.620 --> 01:40:39.340]   But just, hey, Ryan, how are you doing?
[01:40:39.340 --> 01:40:41.060]   Hey, do you think you could do the following
[01:40:41.060 --> 01:40:41.900]   if you get a second?
[01:40:41.900 --> 01:40:43.660]   Like, if I get a second, you're dang right, I can.
[01:40:43.660 --> 01:40:44.500]   Why not?
[01:40:44.500 --> 01:40:45.320]   It's easy to ask.
[01:40:45.320 --> 01:40:47.580]   But it started with some level of politeness.
[01:40:47.580 --> 01:40:48.940]   And I guess like that's,
[01:40:48.940 --> 01:40:51.460]   maybe being semi-Southern, like I grew up in Virginia,
[01:40:51.460 --> 01:40:54.300]   yes sir, yes ma'am, like that goes a long way.
[01:40:54.300 --> 01:40:56.460]   - And there's all different kinds of implementations
[01:40:56.460 --> 01:40:57.300]   of politeness.
[01:40:57.300 --> 01:40:59.660]   I mean, most of the successful people I've met,
[01:40:59.660 --> 01:41:03.740]   it's been surprising to me how much of,
[01:41:03.740 --> 01:41:05.580]   you mentioned peers.
[01:41:05.580 --> 01:41:08.500]   Like I could think of Joe Rogan.
[01:41:08.500 --> 01:41:09.500]   You mentioned Joe Rogan.
[01:41:09.500 --> 01:41:14.500]   But Elon Musk, they don't,
[01:41:14.500 --> 01:41:17.720]   like they almost treat me like I'm the superior.
[01:41:17.720 --> 01:41:18.560]   You know what I mean?
[01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:21.220]   Like it's not even, that's the politeness.
[01:41:21.220 --> 01:41:23.360]   Like, that's the approach.
[01:41:23.360 --> 01:41:25.220]   The feeling of it is like I'm the student,
[01:41:25.220 --> 01:41:27.780]   I'm the beginner, I'm like approaching a situation.
[01:41:27.780 --> 01:41:33.780]   It's almost like method acting of like,
[01:41:33.780 --> 01:41:35.000]   you're better than me.
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:38.220]   And that's how I approach a lot of interactions.
[01:41:38.220 --> 01:41:39.660]   Like I have something to learn from this,
[01:41:39.660 --> 01:41:41.260]   even if it's like a young--
[01:41:41.260 --> 01:41:42.820]   - Do you think that they're ungenuine?
[01:41:42.820 --> 01:41:44.380]   - They're totally genuine.
[01:41:44.380 --> 01:41:45.340]   - But isn't that a funny thing?
[01:41:45.340 --> 01:41:46.420]   Like in spite of who they are,
[01:41:46.420 --> 01:41:48.100]   they're incredibly genuine because they respect,
[01:41:48.100 --> 01:41:48.940]   correct me if I'm wrong,
[01:41:48.940 --> 01:41:50.860]   they respect you obviously for what you bring to the table.
[01:41:50.860 --> 01:41:52.380]   - No, no, they approach everybody like this.
[01:41:52.380 --> 01:41:53.220]   - But that's what I meant.
[01:41:53.220 --> 01:41:54.700]   No, but I'm sure they respect you for what you bring to the table.
[01:41:54.700 --> 01:41:55.940]   Well, beyond that though,
[01:41:55.940 --> 01:41:57.500]   they're treating you with dignity as a human being.
[01:41:57.500 --> 01:41:59.380]   - Yeah, as a human being, that's right.
[01:41:59.380 --> 01:42:01.380]   - And when they could probably get away
[01:42:01.380 --> 01:42:02.380]   with treating most people
[01:42:02.380 --> 01:42:03.900]   without a whole heck of a lot of dignity.
[01:42:03.900 --> 01:42:04.980]   And I guess what does that always say?
[01:42:05.500 --> 01:42:08.260]   Again, you can always tell someone of quality
[01:42:08.260 --> 01:42:11.740]   because they treat the king and the janitor the same way.
[01:42:11.740 --> 01:42:14.380]   But that's what we're seeing a lot.
[01:42:14.380 --> 01:42:16.020]   I guess I don't mean to nitpick,
[01:42:16.020 --> 01:42:18.220]   but that's where we take issue, I guess a little bit,
[01:42:18.220 --> 01:42:19.060]   or disagree with the--
[01:42:19.060 --> 01:42:21.380]   - Are you gonna criticize the internet again?
[01:42:21.380 --> 01:42:22.220]   - I know.
[01:42:22.220 --> 01:42:23.660]   (imitates buzzer)
[01:42:23.660 --> 01:42:25.260]   - The old man yells at clouds.
[01:42:25.260 --> 01:42:30.060]   But anyway, but I guess what I mean is just like
[01:42:30.060 --> 01:42:31.660]   the way that people address each other,
[01:42:31.660 --> 01:42:33.700]   'cause it's so casual now.
[01:42:33.700 --> 01:42:35.620]   And it's great on the one hand, it's nice.
[01:42:35.620 --> 01:42:36.580]   On the other hand, you go,
[01:42:36.580 --> 01:42:41.580]   hey, am I worried about diminishing myself?
[01:42:41.580 --> 01:42:43.460]   It's like the way that I'm sure
[01:42:43.460 --> 01:42:45.740]   that people talk to women sometimes.
[01:42:45.740 --> 01:42:48.500]   And where it's, what's up, girl?
[01:42:48.500 --> 01:42:49.940]   Oh man, she's a bitch.
[01:42:49.940 --> 01:42:53.620]   Versus like, that was supposed to get a good response?
[01:42:53.620 --> 01:42:57.820]   What about that was going to elicit a favorable response?
[01:42:57.820 --> 01:43:01.100]   Versus being anything, anything other than just,
[01:43:01.100 --> 01:43:02.220]   yo man, what's going on?
[01:43:02.220 --> 01:43:04.020]   And I guess that, does that make any sense?
[01:43:04.020 --> 01:43:04.860]   - It makes total sense.
[01:43:04.860 --> 01:43:06.460]   And that Southern thing that you're referring to,
[01:43:06.460 --> 01:43:11.460]   I feel like that's an important part of human communication.
[01:43:11.460 --> 01:43:14.060]   Let me ask you this.
[01:43:14.060 --> 01:43:14.900]   - Sure.
[01:43:14.900 --> 01:43:17.020]   - Your new back attacks instructional.
[01:43:17.020 --> 01:43:19.260]   First of all, awesome.
[01:43:19.260 --> 01:43:20.700]   - Yeah.
[01:43:20.700 --> 01:43:25.300]   - Second of all, you drop a lot of fascinating insights
[01:43:25.300 --> 01:43:28.740]   in there, but you quote Galileo out of all people
[01:43:28.740 --> 01:43:31.260]   in saying that you can't teach a man anything,
[01:43:31.260 --> 01:43:34.340]   you can only help him find it within himself.
[01:43:34.340 --> 01:43:39.340]   So we talked about how to start in Jiu Jitsu.
[01:43:39.340 --> 01:43:41.780]   What about if we zoom out even more
[01:43:41.780 --> 01:43:46.620]   and how do you learn how to learn?
[01:43:46.620 --> 01:43:49.580]   How do you optimize the learning process?
[01:43:49.580 --> 01:43:51.620]   - I don't know the answer to that,
[01:43:51.620 --> 01:43:52.780]   but I can tell you what I like to do.
[01:43:52.780 --> 01:43:55.860]   And I would say like, I can't, step one, I don't, I'm not,
[01:43:55.860 --> 01:43:57.220]   maybe this is a little bit easier for me
[01:43:57.220 --> 01:43:59.860]   'cause I've never had a ton of friends, honestly.
[01:43:59.860 --> 01:44:01.860]   I've got my close friends and people that I know,
[01:44:01.860 --> 01:44:04.180]   but I've never had tons and tons of people.
[01:44:04.180 --> 01:44:06.220]   So I spent a lot of time thinking.
[01:44:06.220 --> 01:44:10.620]   And anyway, I can't control you.
[01:44:10.620 --> 01:44:12.180]   I can't control anybody else.
[01:44:12.180 --> 01:44:17.180]   I, all I can, I wanna take my,
[01:44:17.180 --> 01:44:20.020]   I guess it's a Marcus Aurelius thing.
[01:44:20.020 --> 01:44:22.100]   It's like, I guess the trick to life is figuring out
[01:44:22.100 --> 01:44:23.540]   what's in our control and what's not
[01:44:23.540 --> 01:44:25.940]   and focusing on things that are in our control, I guess.
[01:44:25.940 --> 01:44:29.860]   And so step one is figuring out both internally
[01:44:29.860 --> 01:44:33.180]   and then also out in the world as it pertains to Jiu-Jitsu,
[01:44:33.180 --> 01:44:35.660]   what is actually in my control and what is not.
[01:44:35.660 --> 01:44:37.740]   Like passing someone's guard is not in your control.
[01:44:37.740 --> 01:44:39.260]   People think it is, it ain't.
[01:44:39.260 --> 01:44:43.480]   If I can't just do an activity and be unchecked,
[01:44:43.480 --> 01:44:46.740]   then it ain't in my control entirely.
[01:44:46.740 --> 01:44:47.920]   I can always breathe.
[01:44:47.920 --> 01:44:51.620]   I can always, you know, be calm.
[01:44:51.620 --> 01:44:54.240]   I can always, no matter whether I'm concerned
[01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:56.660]   or not concerned, have whatever you wanna call it, nerves,
[01:44:56.660 --> 01:44:59.300]   you know, I can step forward across the line
[01:44:59.300 --> 01:45:01.540]   and say, I will face the challenge ahead.
[01:45:01.540 --> 01:45:03.740]   That is all entirely, no one can stop me from doing that.
[01:45:03.740 --> 01:45:04.780]   That's entirely me, I control.
[01:45:04.780 --> 01:45:06.860]   And that's why I know that every single time
[01:45:06.860 --> 01:45:07.820]   that I walk into the ring,
[01:45:07.820 --> 01:45:09.740]   I'll walk in and out of there with my head held high
[01:45:09.740 --> 01:45:13.380]   because there's, I will fight with everything that I have.
[01:45:13.380 --> 01:45:15.100]   I can't promise that I'll win.
[01:45:15.100 --> 01:45:17.860]   I would say I'd take that same first principles.
[01:45:17.860 --> 01:45:20.640]   You mentioned last time we talked, you know, with Elon
[01:45:20.640 --> 01:45:23.100]   and the importance of that and going,
[01:45:23.100 --> 01:45:24.620]   what are the first principles?
[01:45:24.620 --> 01:45:26.760]   And I guess to come back, a lot of times, in my opinion,
[01:45:26.760 --> 01:45:30.300]   things that people think are the basics are not the basics.
[01:45:30.300 --> 01:45:31.500]   You can't learn.
[01:45:31.500 --> 01:45:33.380]   If you think you're reasoning for first principles,
[01:45:33.380 --> 01:45:35.220]   but you're actually like level six,
[01:45:35.220 --> 01:45:37.260]   you're actually like layers up,
[01:45:37.260 --> 01:45:39.900]   you're making so many, there's so many baked in assumptions
[01:45:39.900 --> 01:45:41.660]   to what's going on that you're gonna struggle
[01:45:41.660 --> 01:45:44.340]   to understand why anything is actually happening,
[01:45:44.340 --> 01:45:46.300]   internally, externally, you name it.
[01:45:46.300 --> 01:45:48.800]   So I guess what I would start when it comes to learning
[01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:50.580]   is first principles and trying to understand
[01:45:50.580 --> 01:45:53.420]   what's going on, but then also simple things first.
[01:45:53.420 --> 01:45:54.780]   I can control my posture.
[01:45:54.780 --> 01:45:57.580]   I can control my breathing.
[01:45:57.580 --> 01:45:59.900]   No one can stop me from doing that.
[01:45:59.900 --> 01:46:01.780]   I can control where I place my frames.
[01:46:01.780 --> 01:46:03.580]   I can control where I place my limbs.
[01:46:03.580 --> 01:46:05.500]   I can move my feet.
[01:46:05.500 --> 01:46:07.540]   I can develop the ability to do these things better,
[01:46:07.540 --> 01:46:09.060]   of course, and I do that through practice,
[01:46:09.060 --> 01:46:10.500]   through drilling, through watching people.
[01:46:10.500 --> 01:46:12.740]   I've been incredibly fortunate in my time in martial arts
[01:46:12.740 --> 01:46:14.260]   to train with many of my heroes,
[01:46:14.260 --> 01:46:16.300]   to train with many of the people that I looked at
[01:46:16.300 --> 01:46:18.500]   and I was like, that guy is amazing.
[01:46:18.500 --> 01:46:20.340]   I wanna train with this person.
[01:46:20.340 --> 01:46:22.980]   Stephen Thompson, Kenny Florian, George St. Pierre,
[01:46:22.980 --> 01:46:25.340]   Raymond Daniels, Feras Zahabi,
[01:46:25.340 --> 01:46:27.740]   I mean, like Bruno Frizzato, Marcelo Garcia,
[01:46:27.740 --> 01:46:30.700]   all of these guys that are just unbelievable.
[01:46:30.700 --> 01:46:33.980]   And I go, well, they're moving in a way that's different.
[01:46:33.980 --> 01:46:34.900]   Well, how do I do that?
[01:46:34.900 --> 01:46:36.180]   Well, sometimes you can ask them
[01:46:36.180 --> 01:46:37.180]   and they can tell you directly.
[01:46:37.180 --> 01:46:39.620]   Other times people, part of the genius of what they do
[01:46:39.620 --> 01:46:42.220]   is that it's intuitive and maybe they don't think
[01:46:42.220 --> 01:46:44.540]   and understand and see the world the same way that I do.
[01:46:44.540 --> 01:46:47.020]   That was something that I experienced with Marcelo.
[01:46:47.020 --> 01:46:48.020]   He's amazing.
[01:46:48.020 --> 01:46:51.260]   But in a different way than his,
[01:46:51.260 --> 01:46:54.180]   it just, we see things fundamentally different.
[01:46:54.180 --> 01:46:55.380]   We experience the world differently,
[01:46:55.380 --> 01:46:56.820]   it seems to me that we do.
[01:46:56.820 --> 01:46:59.820]   And again, that taught me a really important lesson
[01:46:59.820 --> 01:47:01.220]   'cause I was wanting when I trained there
[01:47:01.220 --> 01:47:03.580]   to have someone go, hey, Ryan, do this, this, this, and this
[01:47:03.580 --> 01:47:04.540]   and that's how it works.
[01:47:04.540 --> 01:47:05.380]   And I was like, all right,
[01:47:05.380 --> 01:47:08.780]   'cause that's how I understood martial arts at the time.
[01:47:08.780 --> 01:47:10.940]   I wasn't ready to have someone tell me like,
[01:47:10.940 --> 01:47:15.180]   hey, it feels a little bit like this
[01:47:15.180 --> 01:47:16.460]   and I just kind of do it,
[01:47:16.460 --> 01:47:19.000]   which is kind of what Marcelo would do at the time
[01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:20.800]   as he was less experienced as a teacher.
[01:47:20.800 --> 01:47:22.900]   But that is what he was doing.
[01:47:22.900 --> 01:47:26.220]   I was completely, I couldn't separate in my mind
[01:47:26.220 --> 01:47:28.740]   performance and understanding.
[01:47:28.740 --> 01:47:30.220]   I thought that if I understand, I could do it.
[01:47:30.220 --> 01:47:32.340]   And I would also struggle sometimes
[01:47:32.340 --> 01:47:35.420]   to wonder why I couldn't execute things
[01:47:35.420 --> 01:47:37.260]   that I thought I understood
[01:47:37.260 --> 01:47:40.220]   and why guys like Marcelo were just so elemental.
[01:47:40.220 --> 01:47:42.260]   I mean, in like the lightning wind,
[01:47:42.260 --> 01:47:43.100]   like that type of thing,
[01:47:43.100 --> 01:47:44.620]   where like it's just so in touch
[01:47:44.620 --> 01:47:47.620]   with what they wanted with their capabilities,
[01:47:47.620 --> 01:47:49.620]   they could summon their powers at will.
[01:47:49.620 --> 01:47:52.220]   I couldn't always do that.
[01:47:52.220 --> 01:47:55.900]   And I guess, so recognizing that there was more
[01:47:55.900 --> 01:47:57.300]   than one way to the top of the mountain.
[01:47:57.300 --> 01:47:58.720]   And also I had a lot of science,
[01:47:58.720 --> 01:47:59.820]   but I didn't have a lot of art,
[01:47:59.820 --> 01:48:01.000]   or I had some science, I should say,
[01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:02.460]   but I didn't have a lot of art.
[01:48:02.460 --> 01:48:04.220]   Meeting people like Marcelo taught me
[01:48:04.220 --> 01:48:05.700]   and then Josh Waitzkin, actually,
[01:48:05.700 --> 01:48:07.780]   brilliant guy, chess champion,
[01:48:07.780 --> 01:48:09.780]   former owner, maybe owner of Marcelo's Academy,
[01:48:09.780 --> 01:48:10.620]   really great friend.
[01:48:10.620 --> 01:48:11.780]   - I think he has a book on learning.
[01:48:11.780 --> 01:48:13.860]   - He does, yeah, "The Art of Learning," actually.
[01:48:13.860 --> 01:48:15.620]   But yeah, he knows a thing or two about it,
[01:48:15.620 --> 01:48:16.460]   but a great guy.
[01:48:16.460 --> 01:48:18.140]   And anyway, he sat me down one time,
[01:48:18.140 --> 01:48:19.900]   was like, "Look, man, you're doing this wrong.
[01:48:19.900 --> 01:48:22.220]   "You're missing the genius,
[01:48:22.220 --> 01:48:24.540]   "the brilliance that's right in front of you."
[01:48:24.540 --> 01:48:26.620]   And it took me a long time.
[01:48:26.620 --> 01:48:27.900]   - What did he mean?
[01:48:27.900 --> 01:48:31.460]   - That I was frustrated with my inability
[01:48:31.460 --> 01:48:32.700]   to grasp certain things,
[01:48:32.700 --> 01:48:34.900]   and sometimes the teaching style being different.
[01:48:34.900 --> 01:48:38.700]   Not wrong, just it was tough on me at the time.
[01:48:38.700 --> 01:48:39.940]   - So you were trying to replicate
[01:48:39.940 --> 01:48:41.060]   what Marcelo was saying,
[01:48:41.060 --> 01:48:44.940]   as opposed to understanding the fundamentals
[01:48:44.940 --> 01:48:46.100]   from which it was coming.
[01:48:46.100 --> 01:48:48.860]   - Right, I couldn't see where it was coming from.
[01:48:48.860 --> 01:48:50.020]   And also, sometimes I'm like,
[01:48:50.020 --> 01:48:51.300]   "Well, why can't you explain it
[01:48:51.300 --> 01:48:53.020]   "in the way that I would want you to explain it?"
[01:48:53.020 --> 01:48:54.500]   And he's like, "Well, why can't I meet him
[01:48:54.500 --> 01:48:55.860]   "where he's coming from?"
[01:48:55.860 --> 01:48:58.340]   So anyway, it was a really important time,
[01:48:58.340 --> 01:48:59.860]   unless I'm very, very frustrating for Monis,
[01:48:59.860 --> 01:49:03.420]   but it's not, I'm so thankful for that time.
[01:49:03.420 --> 01:49:06.100]   And anyway, I guess--
[01:49:06.100 --> 01:49:07.180]   - It's always first principles,
[01:49:07.180 --> 01:49:08.740]   trying to understand the basics,
[01:49:08.740 --> 01:49:09.900]   first starting at the place
[01:49:09.900 --> 01:49:11.820]   where you can control things,
[01:49:11.820 --> 01:49:14.980]   the very basic elements of what you can work with,
[01:49:14.980 --> 01:49:18.940]   and then when there's other mentors and teachers to--
[01:49:18.940 --> 01:49:20.020]   - Meet them where they're coming from.
[01:49:20.020 --> 01:49:20.860]   - Meet them where they're coming from.
[01:49:20.860 --> 01:49:21.740]   - To the extent that I can.
[01:49:21.740 --> 01:49:23.020]   Rather than, I'm not, like again,
[01:49:23.020 --> 01:49:24.660]   it's like, "Why are you not talking to me
[01:49:24.660 --> 01:49:26.700]   "the way I want you to talk to me?"
[01:49:26.700 --> 01:49:28.380]   As opposed to, "Hey, where are you coming from?"
[01:49:28.380 --> 01:49:29.620]   Back to your point.
[01:49:29.620 --> 01:49:32.180]   But I don't know that's not entirely specific,
[01:49:32.180 --> 01:49:34.500]   but if you can focus on that,
[01:49:34.500 --> 01:49:37.140]   and back to the whole, you can't teach a man anything.
[01:49:37.140 --> 01:49:38.940]   Marcelo didn't teach me anything,
[01:49:38.940 --> 01:49:40.820]   but he taught me in so doing,
[01:49:40.820 --> 01:49:45.020]   and other people like that, to find it within.
[01:49:45.020 --> 01:49:46.580]   And it's like, I guess something else
[01:49:46.580 --> 01:49:48.140]   that I've heard before is that
[01:49:48.140 --> 01:49:49.780]   all learning is self-discovery,
[01:49:49.780 --> 01:49:52.140]   but all performance is self-expression.
[01:49:52.140 --> 01:49:54.860]   And I always thought that Marcelo was a brilliant master
[01:49:54.860 --> 01:49:56.140]   of letting what's inside out.
[01:49:56.140 --> 01:49:59.060]   He was so consistent in his performances.
[01:49:59.060 --> 01:50:00.700]   And a lot of times I felt like
[01:50:00.700 --> 01:50:02.060]   there was a block there, personally,
[01:50:02.060 --> 01:50:03.140]   particularly at the end of jiu-jitsu,
[01:50:03.140 --> 01:50:04.860]   when I was very, very results-oriented,
[01:50:04.860 --> 01:50:08.300]   and I wasn't, I think my focus was not ideal.
[01:50:08.300 --> 01:50:09.620]   It was definitely not in the place
[01:50:09.620 --> 01:50:10.900]   that I would like it to be.
[01:50:10.900 --> 01:50:12.740]   And whether I would have won more or lost,
[01:50:12.740 --> 01:50:13.580]   more hard to say,
[01:50:13.580 --> 01:50:14.460]   but I know that I would have performed better
[01:50:14.460 --> 01:50:15.460]   if I'd have adjusted that.
[01:50:15.460 --> 01:50:19.340]   And anyway, that recognizing that, again, jiu-jitsu,
[01:50:19.340 --> 01:50:20.180]   I think I've said it before,
[01:50:20.180 --> 01:50:22.820]   jiu-jitsu is studied as a science, but expressed as an art.
[01:50:22.820 --> 01:50:24.500]   It doesn't matter if you can articulate
[01:50:24.500 --> 01:50:25.340]   what you know how to do.
[01:50:25.340 --> 01:50:27.300]   What matters is if you can do what you know how to do.
[01:50:27.300 --> 01:50:28.300]   It only matters if you're,
[01:50:28.300 --> 01:50:30.140]   I guess if you're teaching in a verbal fashion,
[01:50:30.140 --> 01:50:31.260]   is whether or not you can articulate it.
[01:50:31.260 --> 01:50:35.060]   But recognizing the difference between learning
[01:50:35.060 --> 01:50:37.460]   on an intellectual level or a conceptual level,
[01:50:37.460 --> 01:50:40.380]   and being able to translate that into the physical.
[01:50:40.380 --> 01:50:41.660]   And I guess that's been the thing
[01:50:41.660 --> 01:50:44.220]   that I feel fortunate over time in my own academy,
[01:50:44.220 --> 01:50:46.380]   to be able to kind of fiddle around and learn on my own,
[01:50:46.380 --> 01:50:47.540]   and practice with my students.
[01:50:47.540 --> 01:50:50.500]   And sometimes I struggle to have great training partners.
[01:50:50.500 --> 01:50:51.340]   Like when I say great training partner,
[01:50:51.340 --> 01:50:53.820]   I mean other world-class people to spar, to roll with.
[01:50:53.820 --> 01:50:56.140]   But I've gotten a lot more, honestly,
[01:50:56.140 --> 01:50:58.380]   than I ever would have thought out of being able to practice
[01:50:58.380 --> 01:51:00.740]   and learn and fail and try and succeed on my own
[01:51:00.740 --> 01:51:02.580]   without my own little sandbox.
[01:51:02.580 --> 01:51:06.380]   Figuring out how I can take an idea
[01:51:06.380 --> 01:51:10.260]   and then come up with drills and drills to practice it,
[01:51:10.260 --> 01:51:12.340]   so that I can actually practice putting it into play.
[01:51:12.340 --> 01:51:15.340]   Because again, knowing an idea and then not drilling,
[01:51:15.340 --> 01:51:16.180]   what's the point?
[01:51:16.180 --> 01:51:17.020]   I'll never have it.
[01:51:17.020 --> 01:51:19.060]   It'll never see the light of day.
[01:51:19.060 --> 01:51:22.700]   - So in that DVD, in that instruction DVD, sorry.
[01:51:22.700 --> 01:51:24.980]   - It's an online instructional DVD.
[01:51:24.980 --> 01:51:25.980]   I keep saying DVD though.
[01:51:25.980 --> 01:51:27.540]   - Nobody has DVDs anymore.
[01:51:27.540 --> 01:51:28.380]   - Do they not?
[01:51:28.380 --> 01:51:29.220]   - It's like VHS.
[01:51:29.220 --> 01:51:30.060]   I don't know.
[01:51:30.060 --> 01:51:30.880]   Who has DVD?
[01:51:30.880 --> 01:51:31.720]   What, like Blu-ray?
[01:51:31.720 --> 01:51:33.220]   - I possess some DVDs.
[01:51:33.220 --> 01:51:34.380]   I mean, I've never watched them.
[01:51:34.380 --> 01:51:35.540]   - What do you use them for?
[01:51:35.540 --> 01:51:40.540]   Like a cup, like a thing you put a drink on?
[01:51:40.540 --> 01:51:42.820]   - I mean, when we're in a pinch, yeah.
[01:51:42.820 --> 01:51:48.940]   - What's that even called?
[01:51:48.940 --> 01:51:49.780]   - Coaster?
[01:51:49.780 --> 01:51:52.780]   - Yeah, my matrix coaster.
[01:51:52.780 --> 01:51:55.660]   - The matrix coaster, zeros and ones.
[01:51:55.660 --> 01:52:00.300]   Okay, so in that instruction that people should get,
[01:52:00.300 --> 01:52:02.300]   I've been watching, I'm really enjoying.
[01:52:03.180 --> 01:52:06.500]   It's, I don't even know when it came out recently, right?
[01:52:06.500 --> 01:52:07.620]   - Like December, something like that?
[01:52:07.620 --> 01:52:08.460]   - Yeah.
[01:52:08.460 --> 01:52:09.660]   It's--
[01:52:09.660 --> 01:52:10.500]   - It's part one.
[01:52:10.500 --> 01:52:12.380]   It was actually like, ended up being like 18 hours long
[01:52:12.380 --> 01:52:14.100]   and I was like, oh my God, we're gonna chop it in half.
[01:52:14.100 --> 01:52:16.260]   And when it comes together, the whole thing,
[01:52:16.260 --> 01:52:17.340]   I think, I hope people will like it.
[01:52:17.340 --> 01:52:19.500]   - Yeah, well, it's even part one is really good.
[01:52:19.500 --> 01:52:21.620]   It's actually, yeah, people on Reddit
[01:52:21.620 --> 01:52:23.540]   were really excited for part two as well.
[01:52:23.540 --> 01:52:24.380]   - Really?
[01:52:24.380 --> 01:52:25.820]   - And you also have a back--
[01:52:25.820 --> 01:52:26.660]   - Oh, the old one.
[01:52:26.660 --> 01:52:29.420]   - The old one that I, that was really helpful to me
[01:52:29.420 --> 01:52:32.700]   to understand some very basic aspects of control
[01:52:32.700 --> 01:52:33.540]   and foot back. - Really?
[01:52:33.540 --> 01:52:37.380]   - Yeah, that was, you know, that clicked with me.
[01:52:37.380 --> 01:52:39.140]   There's very few instructionals.
[01:52:39.140 --> 01:52:41.900]   There's very few things I've watched
[01:52:41.900 --> 01:52:45.260]   that ever clicked with me and that was definitely it.
[01:52:45.260 --> 01:52:48.380]   It taught me one thing, I don't know,
[01:52:48.380 --> 01:52:51.700]   it's, you drop a lot of, what's there, bombs?
[01:52:51.700 --> 01:52:54.760]   You drop a lot of really interesting details.
[01:52:54.760 --> 01:52:59.220]   And it's funny that there's only specific things
[01:52:59.220 --> 01:53:00.700]   that really click.
[01:53:00.700 --> 01:53:02.140]   Like a lot of it rings true
[01:53:02.140 --> 01:53:03.580]   and you kind of take it in and it's like,
[01:53:03.580 --> 01:53:05.480]   oh, that's interesting, okay, yeah.
[01:53:05.480 --> 01:53:07.100]   But there's certain things that really click.
[01:53:07.100 --> 01:53:11.180]   And I remember that first instruction
[01:53:11.180 --> 01:53:14.300]   what clicked with me is like the importance.
[01:53:14.300 --> 01:53:17.580]   I don't remember anymore like how you communicated it
[01:53:17.580 --> 01:53:20.220]   because I've now integrated, it's now mine.
[01:53:20.220 --> 01:53:21.820]   You know what I mean?
[01:53:21.820 --> 01:53:26.040]   But it was more about you just describing upper body control
[01:53:26.040 --> 01:53:29.540]   and the importance of the upper body control from the back.
[01:53:29.540 --> 01:53:31.420]   And just like there's certain,
[01:53:31.420 --> 01:53:35.900]   you describe different details on the grips and so on.
[01:53:35.900 --> 01:53:38.060]   And as I started trying it,
[01:53:38.060 --> 01:53:42.640]   I realized how important upper body control is
[01:53:42.640 --> 01:53:46.660]   versus like me, maybe as a blue belt or something,
[01:53:46.660 --> 01:53:49.200]   I thought like you have achieved victory
[01:53:49.200 --> 01:53:51.420]   when you got the two hooks in.
[01:53:51.420 --> 01:53:53.580]   And then I realized like, at least for me,
[01:53:53.580 --> 01:53:56.760]   that the hooks were not even for my body type,
[01:53:56.760 --> 01:53:59.300]   for my style, for the way I approach things,
[01:53:59.300 --> 01:54:01.020]   they were not even important at all.
[01:54:01.020 --> 01:54:02.340]   - They're supplemental for the most part.
[01:54:02.340 --> 01:54:04.340]   - Yeah, so they were there for the points,
[01:54:04.340 --> 01:54:07.180]   but I can establish a huge amount of control.
[01:54:07.180 --> 01:54:10.860]   In fact, the hooks were,
[01:54:10.860 --> 01:54:13.220]   you were talking about like illusion of choice.
[01:54:13.220 --> 01:54:17.440]   It almost made people panic a lot more
[01:54:17.440 --> 01:54:18.740]   when you were like fighting for it
[01:54:18.740 --> 01:54:20.140]   or establishing that kind of control.
[01:54:20.140 --> 01:54:24.180]   They were a lot less panicked when the hooks weren't involved
[01:54:24.180 --> 01:54:25.980]   even though they should be a lot more panicked.
[01:54:25.980 --> 01:54:28.820]   Anyway, I realized a lot of those kinds of things,
[01:54:28.820 --> 01:54:30.220]   especially that had to do with judo
[01:54:30.220 --> 01:54:33.620]   because so much of judo on the ground
[01:54:33.620 --> 01:54:36.460]   is centered around aggressive, efficient,
[01:54:36.460 --> 01:54:39.740]   very fast choking, different kinds of clock chokes
[01:54:39.740 --> 01:54:41.260]   and all that kind of stuff.
[01:54:41.260 --> 01:54:43.060]   - What a brilliant thing that is only gonna start
[01:54:43.060 --> 01:54:44.620]   to make its way into jiu-jitsu coming up,
[01:54:44.620 --> 01:54:47.100]   but like the judo style approach to like clock choking,
[01:54:47.100 --> 01:54:49.540]   triangling from the top of the turtle and stuff,
[01:54:49.540 --> 01:54:50.500]   so powerful.
[01:54:50.500 --> 01:54:53.480]   - Yeah, and there's something about judo
[01:54:53.480 --> 01:54:57.420]   that emphasizes obviously due to the rules, the urgency.
[01:54:57.420 --> 01:55:00.300]   So you only do techniques that go fast.
[01:55:00.300 --> 01:55:02.140]   And then the other thing is,
[01:55:02.140 --> 01:55:05.300]   which I guess jiu-jitsu emphasizes too,
[01:55:05.300 --> 01:55:10.220]   but judo really does, which is the transition.
[01:55:10.220 --> 01:55:12.300]   So like while the person's flying in the air
[01:55:12.300 --> 01:55:14.100]   is the easiest time.
[01:55:14.100 --> 01:55:15.980]   I mean, this is like Ryan Hall type of shit,
[01:55:15.980 --> 01:55:20.900]   which is like, why not put in your submissions
[01:55:20.900 --> 01:55:23.940]   or positional control while they're in the air?
[01:55:23.940 --> 01:55:26.060]   - If you could, why would you not, right?
[01:55:26.060 --> 01:55:27.420]   - Yeah, so you should be-- - Oh, well, I don't throw well.
[01:55:27.420 --> 01:55:29.660]   Well, learn how to throw and then do it.
[01:55:29.660 --> 01:55:32.580]   - And so you should think, I mean, in the transition,
[01:55:32.580 --> 01:55:35.180]   when they're flying is the easiest time to put in stuff.
[01:55:35.180 --> 01:55:37.900]   And that's when you think about chokes,
[01:55:37.900 --> 01:55:40.740]   as you're throwing, you should be thinking about the choke
[01:55:40.740 --> 01:55:42.940]   and then everything becomes a lot easier.
[01:55:42.940 --> 01:55:44.340]   - You ever see Flavio Canto?
[01:55:44.340 --> 01:55:48.700]   Man, Brazilian judoka is so cool.
[01:55:48.700 --> 01:55:49.660]   Like with stuff like that.
[01:55:49.660 --> 01:55:51.300]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:55:51.300 --> 01:55:53.580]   But that has to do with the first starting principle
[01:55:53.580 --> 01:55:57.420]   of like, stop thinking this as a two phase game
[01:55:57.420 --> 01:56:00.220]   of standing and then ground.
[01:56:00.220 --> 01:56:03.820]   Start thinking about like the standing and the ground.
[01:56:03.820 --> 01:56:05.740]   The standing comes before and the ground comes after,
[01:56:05.740 --> 01:56:07.740]   but everything happens in a transition.
[01:56:07.740 --> 01:56:09.700]   - Well, unless you're attacking, what is the art of war?
[01:56:09.700 --> 01:56:10.980]   Like we all like, everyone's like,
[01:56:10.980 --> 01:56:12.540]   oh yeah, the art of war, oh yes, yes, yes.
[01:56:12.540 --> 01:56:14.060]   And then they immediately throw it away
[01:56:14.060 --> 01:56:16.340]   and then fight like a fricking barbarian.
[01:56:16.340 --> 01:56:18.580]   But I mean like, I'm serious.
[01:56:18.580 --> 01:56:20.980]   But you know, how many people quote stuff
[01:56:20.980 --> 01:56:22.700]   and then like, you know, it's like,
[01:56:22.700 --> 01:56:23.860]   what is it, the family guy joke?
[01:56:23.860 --> 01:56:25.300]   Or they're like, you know, quoting Jesus
[01:56:25.300 --> 01:56:26.300]   and Jesus walks in, he's like,
[01:56:26.300 --> 01:56:27.140]   you're not listening to my work,
[01:56:27.140 --> 01:56:27.980]   what are you talking about?
[01:56:27.980 --> 01:56:32.260]   And anyway, basically, you know, like what do you,
[01:56:32.260 --> 01:56:33.700]   like the art of war, you know, one of the things
[01:56:33.700 --> 01:56:35.540]   it's like the only thing that you can be sure
[01:56:35.540 --> 01:56:37.100]   of being successful in attacking
[01:56:37.100 --> 01:56:39.060]   is something that's undefended.
[01:56:39.060 --> 01:56:39.900]   We're like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:56:39.900 --> 01:56:42.500]   But you know, in a fight though, they're defended.
[01:56:42.500 --> 01:56:44.300]   Well, are they?
[01:56:44.300 --> 01:56:45.660]   There's moments all the time
[01:56:45.660 --> 01:56:47.260]   where I'm borderline defenseless.
[01:56:47.260 --> 01:56:49.600]   And if you were to attack at that moment,
[01:56:49.600 --> 01:56:51.700]   if you could see it and then seize the moment,
[01:56:51.700 --> 01:56:53.300]   if you were capable of both,
[01:56:53.300 --> 01:56:54.980]   you should not only expect to be successful,
[01:56:54.980 --> 01:56:56.260]   you should be damn sure you're gonna be successful.
[01:56:56.260 --> 01:56:58.020]   And more important than that, you'll be successful.
[01:56:58.020 --> 01:57:00.140]   And even if somehow not, you won't be countered.
[01:57:00.140 --> 01:57:04.260]   And I guess like, that's the trick of almost all,
[01:57:04.260 --> 01:57:05.940]   all like conflict, right?
[01:57:05.940 --> 01:57:07.700]   It's like showing up when the other person's,
[01:57:07.700 --> 01:57:09.100]   you know, taking a nap.
[01:57:09.100 --> 01:57:11.820]   And then it's so funny, like we take like a protracted war.
[01:57:11.820 --> 01:57:13.220]   It's like, oh, it takes five years.
[01:57:13.220 --> 01:57:15.620]   And there's, you know, lulls and there's a battle this month
[01:57:15.620 --> 01:57:17.080]   but then there's a couple of weeks and another battle.
[01:57:17.080 --> 01:57:18.600]   It's like, well, if you just shrink that down,
[01:57:18.600 --> 01:57:20.700]   it's the microcosm, macrocosm idea.
[01:57:20.700 --> 01:57:22.700]   That same thing, that whole war is taking place
[01:57:22.700 --> 01:57:24.700]   in five minutes or 10 minutes or 15 minutes.
[01:57:24.700 --> 01:57:27.100]   And there's moments of lulls of person
[01:57:27.100 --> 01:57:29.260]   effectively going for a snack, you know,
[01:57:29.260 --> 01:57:30.780]   being like, you know, in a horror movie, like,
[01:57:30.780 --> 01:57:32.300]   hey guys, I'm gonna go get a beer from the,
[01:57:32.300 --> 01:57:34.140]   from around the way, like I'm dead for sure.
[01:57:34.140 --> 01:57:35.700]   So anyway.
[01:57:35.700 --> 01:57:38.800]   - Is there, on this particular instructional,
[01:57:38.800 --> 01:57:40.600]   if you can convert it to words,
[01:57:40.600 --> 01:57:43.780]   you talk about finishing the submission.
[01:57:43.780 --> 01:57:47.040]   Is there some interesting insights
[01:57:47.040 --> 01:57:49.060]   that you find beautiful or profound
[01:57:49.060 --> 01:57:51.740]   about finishing the rear naked choke
[01:57:51.740 --> 01:57:54.300]   or just finishing the submissions for the back control?
[01:57:54.300 --> 01:57:56.120]   Is there something like, you know,
[01:57:56.120 --> 01:57:58.380]   you talk about the squeeze and the crush
[01:57:58.380 --> 01:58:00.080]   and all these kinds of principles.
[01:58:00.080 --> 01:58:03.340]   Is there something about control,
[01:58:03.340 --> 01:58:05.780]   about the process of finishing
[01:58:05.780 --> 01:58:09.380]   that you find especially profound about this position?
[01:58:09.380 --> 01:58:10.220]   - Absolutely.
[01:58:10.220 --> 01:58:11.860]   The opposite of one profound truth
[01:58:11.860 --> 01:58:13.460]   can be another profound truth.
[01:58:13.460 --> 01:58:17.740]   So like, it's, I do--
[01:58:17.740 --> 01:58:18.580]   - Did Jesus say that?
[01:58:18.580 --> 01:58:21.540]   - No, I don't, I actually was a guy on Tumblr,
[01:58:21.540 --> 01:58:24.340]   but yeah, it was really, really cool.
[01:58:24.340 --> 01:58:26.340]   There was like a tree in the background,
[01:58:26.340 --> 01:58:30.060]   but anyway, but so let's say like,
[01:58:30.060 --> 01:58:32.540]   I'll use examples like first off,
[01:58:32.540 --> 01:58:35.120]   I saw someone finishing a 50/50 heel hook
[01:58:35.120 --> 01:58:37.020]   in the UFC one promo.
[01:58:37.020 --> 01:58:39.220]   It was like some chubby dude in a karate,
[01:58:39.220 --> 01:58:41.100]   like inside heel hook and another dude.
[01:58:41.100 --> 01:58:43.900]   And you go, huh?
[01:58:43.900 --> 01:58:45.460]   Well, I didn't know they were doing that back then,
[01:58:45.460 --> 01:58:46.780]   at least, and whether they were doing it all.
[01:58:46.780 --> 01:58:49.140]   How many times does someone do something
[01:58:49.140 --> 01:58:51.140]   and then that works and then we go,
[01:58:51.140 --> 01:58:53.500]   okay, cool versus, hey, maybe we should do that all the time.
[01:58:53.500 --> 01:58:56.060]   So anyway, how long were we all taught to do the seatbelt
[01:58:56.060 --> 01:58:58.300]   the way we all do the seatbelt in Jiu-Jitsu?
[01:58:58.300 --> 01:58:59.420]   Like long time, why?
[01:58:59.420 --> 01:59:02.000]   Works, in fact, it works so well.
[01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:05.060]   And it was so, it was then the people who used it
[01:59:05.060 --> 01:59:07.780]   were so prolific that we went,
[01:59:07.780 --> 01:59:10.140]   well, solve that one, good to go.
[01:59:10.140 --> 01:59:11.940]   All right, no more thinking.
[01:59:11.940 --> 01:59:14.180]   And then you go, imagine you were to like the Merkel
[01:59:14.180 --> 01:59:15.780]   and Merkel flip all those positions
[01:59:15.780 --> 01:59:17.180]   that were showing in the DVD,
[01:59:17.180 --> 01:59:18.940]   which is pretty much whatever the heck it is,
[01:59:18.940 --> 01:59:21.760]   and all the digital VD.
[01:59:21.760 --> 01:59:24.540]   No, not VD, I don't want that.
[01:59:24.540 --> 01:59:26.260]   Digital video something.
[01:59:26.260 --> 01:59:31.180]   But basically recognizing that doing it on the wrong side
[01:59:31.180 --> 01:59:33.020]   is at least as effective.
[01:59:33.020 --> 01:59:34.960]   Doesn't mean that the other side wasn't good.
[01:59:34.960 --> 01:59:35.800]   There could be something
[01:59:35.800 --> 01:59:38.500]   that's the literal borderline opposite of that.
[01:59:38.500 --> 01:59:42.700]   And you go, huh, well, that's something.
[01:59:42.700 --> 01:59:45.020]   Like imagine, like I would say almost all of these things,
[01:59:45.020 --> 01:59:46.500]   all the tactics and all the strategies.
[01:59:46.500 --> 01:59:48.300]   So I guess that was something that we came to,
[01:59:48.300 --> 01:59:51.180]   like training in the gym, like a year ago maybe?
[01:59:51.180 --> 01:59:52.820]   I've been playing with since, and it's just, it's huge.
[01:59:52.820 --> 01:59:54.060]   I'm like, oh wait, so let me get this straight.
[01:59:54.060 --> 01:59:55.780]   First off, I can use my strong side seatbelt,
[01:59:55.780 --> 01:59:58.380]   my right arm over the shoulder all the time.
[01:59:58.380 --> 01:59:59.460]   Well, that's really helpful
[01:59:59.460 --> 02:00:00.740]   because that's a lot better than my left.
[02:00:00.740 --> 02:00:01.620]   I can do both sides of my left,
[02:00:01.620 --> 02:00:03.940]   but if I had to bet my life on being able to finish it,
[02:00:03.940 --> 02:00:05.220]   I would want my right arm over.
[02:00:05.220 --> 02:00:07.780]   Huh, everything that's a tactic or a strategy
[02:00:07.780 --> 02:00:08.720]   evolved from an idea.
[02:00:08.720 --> 02:00:10.580]   Like capitalism's an idea.
[02:00:10.580 --> 02:00:11.860]   You know, anarchy is an idea.
[02:00:11.860 --> 02:00:13.460]   And then it becomes, well, what does that all mean?
[02:00:13.460 --> 02:00:14.580]   What are the consequences?
[02:00:14.580 --> 02:00:16.100]   What was the fallout of all this, right?
[02:00:16.100 --> 02:00:19.940]   So what if we start with jujitsu, the idea of the guard,
[02:00:19.940 --> 02:00:22.100]   right, and we go, well, I mean, Wendy, why do you use
[02:00:22.100 --> 02:00:22.920]   the guard?
[02:00:22.920 --> 02:00:25.420]   Northern martial art really has developed the guard
[02:00:25.420 --> 02:00:26.900]   in the same way that jujitsu has.
[02:00:26.900 --> 02:00:27.740]   Well, what is the guard?
[02:00:27.740 --> 02:00:29.740]   A guard's a defensive idea where you're kind of
[02:00:29.740 --> 02:00:31.980]   on your back to some extent or another,
[02:00:31.980 --> 02:00:33.820]   and you're using your legs as a wall between you
[02:00:33.820 --> 02:00:36.340]   and the other person, and the other guy represents danger.
[02:00:36.340 --> 02:00:38.300]   And you're like, yeah, yeah, that's a great idea.
[02:00:38.300 --> 02:00:39.460]   Is it?
[02:00:39.460 --> 02:00:41.620]   I mean, it clearly works, at least to a certain extent,
[02:00:41.620 --> 02:00:44.980]   but where do I want to put my legs when I want to get up?
[02:00:44.980 --> 02:00:45.820]   Not on the other dude.
[02:00:45.820 --> 02:00:47.580]   I'm trying to put them on things on the floor.
[02:00:47.580 --> 02:00:49.660]   If I want to generate a ton of power,
[02:00:49.660 --> 02:00:51.100]   what's the first thing I do with my feet?
[02:00:51.100 --> 02:00:52.380]   I anchor them to the floor.
[02:00:52.380 --> 02:00:53.740]   Drive for a punch, you name it.
[02:00:53.740 --> 02:00:56.280]   Move away, jump, dart, you name it.
[02:00:56.280 --> 02:00:58.680]   So does it mean that that's a terrible idea
[02:00:58.680 --> 02:00:59.520]   to be on your back?
[02:00:59.520 --> 02:01:01.740]   No, clearly it works, and clearly it,
[02:01:01.740 --> 02:01:03.300]   a little phrase, has function.
[02:01:03.300 --> 02:01:04.980]   But what if the function that we're giving it,
[02:01:04.980 --> 02:01:08.300]   and how much focus we're assigning to it
[02:01:08.300 --> 02:01:11.280]   is disproportionate to its effectiveness?
[02:01:11.280 --> 02:01:13.180]   Maybe, what if it's not a good idea?
[02:01:13.180 --> 02:01:15.060]   I'm not saying it's not a good idea, but what if it wasn't?
[02:01:15.060 --> 02:01:16.940]   That's a foundational idea of jujitsu.
[02:01:16.940 --> 02:01:20.260]   And then how much, because no one questions that foundation,
[02:01:20.260 --> 02:01:22.980]   how much innovation is built on top of the idea,
[02:01:22.980 --> 02:01:24.300]   well, of course I want to be,
[02:01:24.300 --> 02:01:25.940]   my being on my back is an okay position.
[02:01:25.940 --> 02:01:27.300]   So now they're innovating,
[02:01:27.300 --> 02:01:29.180]   but they're innovating within a closed system
[02:01:29.180 --> 02:01:30.620]   that they don't even, they think they're innovating
[02:01:30.620 --> 02:01:32.500]   in like, in this open space of,
[02:01:32.500 --> 02:01:33.580]   oh my God, it could be anything,
[02:01:33.580 --> 02:01:36.420]   when in reality, it could be anything within this little set.
[02:01:36.420 --> 02:01:37.820]   But you don't realize that you're in a set.
[02:01:37.820 --> 02:01:39.460]   You don't realize that you're in a box.
[02:01:39.460 --> 02:01:40.880]   There would be answers that would become
[02:01:40.880 --> 02:01:42.640]   so immediately apparent to you
[02:01:42.640 --> 02:01:44.760]   if you were willing to look outside of that,
[02:01:44.760 --> 02:01:47.280]   but you'll literally never even look over to your left
[02:01:47.280 --> 02:01:49.920]   because you don't even realize the left exists.
[02:01:49.920 --> 02:01:52.360]   - Do you think there's a lot of places in jujitsu,
[02:01:52.360 --> 02:01:54.480]   whether it's back control or generally guards
[02:01:54.480 --> 02:01:55.960]   and all the different positions,
[02:01:55.960 --> 02:01:58.360]   where there's a lot of space,
[02:01:58.360 --> 02:02:01.760]   like a lot to be discovered
[02:02:01.760 --> 02:02:03.840]   by questioning the basic assumptions?
[02:02:03.840 --> 02:02:06.200]   Maybe if you can give examples of like back control,
[02:02:06.200 --> 02:02:08.160]   like is there something you've discovered that's like--
[02:02:08.160 --> 02:02:09.700]   - Merkle versus seatbelt.
[02:02:09.700 --> 02:02:10.820]   - What's Merkle, what's seatbelt?
[02:02:10.820 --> 02:02:13.140]   - Seatbelt is a right arm over the shoulder,
[02:02:13.140 --> 02:02:14.900]   left arm under the arm.
[02:02:14.900 --> 02:02:17.620]   I'm on the same side as my choking arm.
[02:02:17.620 --> 02:02:19.300]   Merkle is just, I do the same thing.
[02:02:19.300 --> 02:02:20.620]   I don't even adjust my hands.
[02:02:20.620 --> 02:02:22.100]   I walk myself over to the left side.
[02:02:22.100 --> 02:02:23.020]   I'm on the opposite side.
[02:02:23.020 --> 02:02:24.340]   It's actually a more powerful position.
[02:02:24.340 --> 02:02:25.300]   - Yeah, for people listening
[02:02:25.300 --> 02:02:26.820]   or for people who might not know,
[02:02:26.820 --> 02:02:30.260]   jujitsu is a seatbelt is a control.
[02:02:30.260 --> 02:02:32.380]   We're talking about when one person
[02:02:32.380 --> 02:02:34.100]   is on the back of another person,
[02:02:34.100 --> 02:02:36.500]   which is a really dominant position in jujitsu,
[02:02:36.500 --> 02:02:41.500]   seatbelt is a, I guess, widely accepted way of holding--
[02:02:41.500 --> 02:02:42.680]   - Best practices almost.
[02:02:42.680 --> 02:02:45.320]   - Best practices, yeah, and it's worked so well.
[02:02:45.320 --> 02:02:49.200]   So it's a one arm over, one arm under,
[02:02:49.200 --> 02:02:52.480]   and there's a certain side you're supposed to be on
[02:02:52.480 --> 02:02:53.800]   when you're on the back.
[02:02:53.800 --> 02:02:56.000]   Everyone teaches there's a choking arm
[02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:57.600]   that's the arm that's over,
[02:02:57.600 --> 02:02:58.760]   and your body's supposed to be
[02:02:58.760 --> 02:03:01.040]   on a certain side relative to that.
[02:03:01.040 --> 02:03:04.040]   And then Ryan is describing questioning
[02:03:04.040 --> 02:03:06.220]   these basic assumptions
[02:03:06.220 --> 02:03:07.660]   about which side you're supposed to be on.
[02:03:07.660 --> 02:03:09.740]   - And let's say that's even just a mid-level assumption.
[02:03:09.740 --> 02:03:11.620]   It's not even a first principles assumption,
[02:03:11.620 --> 02:03:13.700]   but it's getting there.
[02:03:13.700 --> 02:03:15.660]   But let's just say for sake of argument,
[02:03:15.660 --> 02:03:17.420]   it goes a lot deeper maybe.
[02:03:17.420 --> 02:03:21.720]   I think most of the innovation that I see is not innovation.
[02:03:21.720 --> 02:03:24.780]   It's basically changing the color of a car
[02:03:24.780 --> 02:03:27.220]   or polishing the window a little bit.
[02:03:27.220 --> 02:03:29.540]   We're like, "Hey, you made it a little bit different.
[02:03:29.540 --> 02:03:30.860]   "You made it a little bit better."
[02:03:30.860 --> 02:03:32.680]   It's like, "Oh man, what if I did the same guard
[02:03:32.680 --> 02:03:34.020]   "and then grab the lapel?"
[02:03:34.020 --> 02:03:35.260]   I'm not saying that's bad,
[02:03:35.260 --> 02:03:37.180]   but you're not fundamentally changing anything.
[02:03:37.180 --> 02:03:39.100]   I think most of the big seismic shifts
[02:03:39.100 --> 02:03:41.100]   that we see in almost anything come from,
[02:03:41.100 --> 02:03:44.720]   "Hey, that thing we thought was right was wrong,"
[02:03:44.720 --> 02:03:48.060]   rather than, "Not only is it right, it's even righter."
[02:03:48.060 --> 02:03:49.580]   And you're like, "It's not wrong, it's not bad."
[02:03:49.580 --> 02:03:52.360]   But it's like, "Oh man, let's say for instance,
[02:03:52.360 --> 02:03:53.320]   "I didn't make the triangle better,
[02:03:53.320 --> 02:03:54.820]   "but let's say I made the triangle a little bit better
[02:03:54.820 --> 02:03:56.840]   "than it was, or than it was taught."
[02:03:56.840 --> 02:04:00.060]   I mean, you can call it innovation.
[02:04:00.060 --> 02:04:00.880]   I don't know, man.
[02:04:00.880 --> 02:04:01.780]   It's not like the person that said,
[02:04:01.780 --> 02:04:03.560]   "Hey, have you guys ever heard of a triangle before
[02:04:03.560 --> 02:04:04.460]   "and came up with that?"
[02:04:04.460 --> 02:04:06.500]   We're like, "That's on the list.
[02:04:06.500 --> 02:04:07.580]   "You can do this thing to people?
[02:04:07.580 --> 02:04:08.500]   "Are you kidding me?"
[02:04:08.500 --> 02:04:11.540]   Can you imagine you invented the straight right hand?
[02:04:11.540 --> 02:04:12.580]   You'd be like one punch man.
[02:04:12.580 --> 02:04:14.580]   You can walk around and just lay low
[02:04:14.580 --> 02:04:16.220]   every single person you got into a fight with,
[02:04:16.220 --> 02:04:17.420]   'cause it didn't even occur to them
[02:04:17.420 --> 02:04:19.500]   to hit you with their backhand.
[02:04:19.500 --> 02:04:22.240]   In a world full of jabbers, you throw your backhand.
[02:04:22.240 --> 02:04:23.500]   You're gonna kill people.
[02:04:23.500 --> 02:04:24.340]   So basically--
[02:04:24.340 --> 02:04:26.980]   - Well, but by the way, I mean, just to pause on that,
[02:04:26.980 --> 02:04:29.700]   first of all, somebody did invent the triangle probably.
[02:04:29.700 --> 02:04:30.520]   - For sure.
[02:04:30.520 --> 02:04:32.180]   - It's not a trivial thing once you think--
[02:04:32.180 --> 02:04:33.020]   - No.
[02:04:33.020 --> 02:04:35.160]   How many of these giant things that we all go like,
[02:04:35.160 --> 02:04:36.540]   "Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, we all use that now."
[02:04:36.540 --> 02:04:38.800]   Can you imagine you have triangles and heel hooks
[02:04:38.800 --> 02:04:41.820]   and rear naked chokes and I don't have those?
[02:04:41.820 --> 02:04:42.660]   You're unbeatable, you're borderline.
[02:04:42.660 --> 02:04:44.740]   I mean, that's why we all experience,
[02:04:44.740 --> 02:04:46.140]   every single one of us, particularly those of us,
[02:04:46.140 --> 02:04:48.820]   I mean, when did you first start training legs?
[02:04:48.820 --> 02:04:50.020]   - 12, 13 years.
[02:04:50.020 --> 02:04:51.940]   Well, let's not count wrestling,
[02:04:51.940 --> 02:04:53.780]   but 13 years ago with jiu-jitsu.
[02:04:53.780 --> 02:04:54.620]   - Right on.
[02:04:54.620 --> 02:04:55.980]   So let's say about that time where particularly
[02:04:55.980 --> 02:04:58.540]   it was still kind of underground-y,
[02:04:58.540 --> 02:05:00.300]   and you're like, "Hey, we all experienced
[02:05:00.300 --> 02:05:03.620]   "being a relative, like a mid-level white belt
[02:05:03.620 --> 02:05:06.360]   "and being able to easily beat up all our friends."
[02:05:06.360 --> 02:05:07.760]   Because everyone wrestled other buddies.
[02:05:07.760 --> 02:05:09.240]   And it was one of those ones where like,
[02:05:09.240 --> 02:05:11.480]   "They don't have weapons to end the fight.
[02:05:11.480 --> 02:05:13.880]   "You have weapons to end the fight."
[02:05:13.880 --> 02:05:18.880]   That's such a crazy, asymmetric advantage
[02:05:18.880 --> 02:05:22.040]   that if you lose, it's on you now, man.
[02:05:22.040 --> 02:05:25.180]   Next time it's like, "I've got this rifle
[02:05:25.180 --> 02:05:26.100]   "and you have nothing."
[02:05:26.100 --> 02:05:27.360]   And I decide to put it on my back
[02:05:27.360 --> 02:05:28.640]   and then run over and try to karate chop.
[02:05:28.640 --> 02:05:30.360]   You're like, "Okay, next time,
[02:05:30.360 --> 02:05:31.920]   "just make sure you use the rifle, bud."
[02:05:31.920 --> 02:05:33.400]   I'm like, "Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I should do that."
[02:05:33.400 --> 02:05:35.240]   - Yeah, it's kind of fascinating.
[02:05:35.240 --> 02:05:37.080]   I mean, everything you're describing,
[02:05:37.080 --> 02:05:40.200]   there's a fascinating tension between
[02:05:40.200 --> 02:05:41.760]   whenever I show people for the first time
[02:05:41.760 --> 02:05:44.000]   what a triangle is, just like regular people.
[02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.280]   It's like they're discovering,
[02:05:46.280 --> 02:05:47.960]   it's like, "Oh, okay, that's interesting."
[02:05:47.960 --> 02:05:49.160]   I mean, MMA has changed that,
[02:05:49.160 --> 02:05:51.580]   but people haven't watched MMA.
[02:05:51.580 --> 02:05:52.720]   That's an interesting move.
[02:05:52.720 --> 02:05:54.880]   It doesn't make sense why that would be a choke.
[02:05:54.880 --> 02:05:59.360]   And they kind of quickly accept that that's a thing
[02:05:59.360 --> 02:06:02.640]   and they accept the basics without questioning,
[02:06:02.640 --> 02:06:05.460]   wait a minute, what's actually being choked?
[02:06:05.460 --> 02:06:11.720]   How is it that a shoulder of a person can do the choking?
[02:06:11.720 --> 02:06:15.320]   I'm not sure I fully questioned
[02:06:15.320 --> 02:06:16.760]   the fundamentals of all of that.
[02:06:16.760 --> 02:06:17.880]   - I claim I have either.
[02:06:17.880 --> 02:06:21.560]   - What exactly is the blood supply that's being cut off?
[02:06:21.560 --> 02:06:24.640]   What is the anatomy and the physiology of all of that?
[02:06:24.640 --> 02:06:25.460]   How does this work?
[02:06:25.460 --> 02:06:27.360]   And if you understood all that, what else can we do here?
[02:06:27.360 --> 02:06:28.720]   - Yeah, what else can we do here?
[02:06:28.720 --> 02:06:30.000]   That's the really important thing.
[02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:31.640]   - But if I'm an end user,
[02:06:31.640 --> 02:06:33.320]   which almost everyone is of almost anything,
[02:06:33.320 --> 02:06:34.800]   I'm serious, where I'm like,
[02:06:34.800 --> 02:06:35.800]   I think about stuff in my life,
[02:06:35.800 --> 02:06:37.000]   the only things I really think about
[02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:39.240]   are like martial arts and martial arts strategy
[02:06:39.240 --> 02:06:40.840]   and I don't know, some other,
[02:06:40.840 --> 02:06:42.760]   a couple of other things, but not much.
[02:06:42.760 --> 02:06:46.160]   And anything else in my life is borderline unexamined.
[02:06:46.160 --> 02:06:47.800]   And I like to think that if I put a lot of effort
[02:06:47.800 --> 02:06:49.480]   in something, I'd like to think that I could figure
[02:06:49.480 --> 02:06:50.800]   at least some things out about it.
[02:06:50.800 --> 02:06:53.160]   But I figured out almost nothing about anything in my life
[02:06:53.160 --> 02:06:54.760]   because I haven't even looked.
[02:06:54.760 --> 02:06:57.840]   And if you're an end user, what are you capable of
[02:06:57.840 --> 02:07:00.840]   versus you can literally alter the source code.
[02:07:00.840 --> 02:07:02.840]   You are Neo in the fricking matrix.
[02:07:02.840 --> 02:07:04.920]   If you can alter the code and I can't.
[02:07:04.920 --> 02:07:07.000]   And it's like, we think, ah, ha, ha, ha.
[02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:10.680]   But imagine you are a world-class anything
[02:07:10.680 --> 02:07:11.920]   or even not even world-class, forget it.
[02:07:11.920 --> 02:07:13.800]   Like a purple belt compared to a white belt
[02:07:13.800 --> 02:07:16.080]   or compared to a no belt might as well be John Jones
[02:07:16.080 --> 02:07:16.920]   or Marcello Garcia.
[02:07:16.920 --> 02:07:18.920]   You're gonna beat them up comparably bad.
[02:07:18.920 --> 02:07:21.880]   So that actually is a common thing
[02:07:21.880 --> 02:07:23.400]   where people can't tell the difference between levels.
[02:07:23.400 --> 02:07:24.240]   They're like, oh man, I've trained
[02:07:24.240 --> 02:07:25.120]   with my black belt instructor.
[02:07:25.120 --> 02:07:26.360]   How much better could so-and-so be?
[02:07:26.360 --> 02:07:29.440]   And like so much better you're gonna have a hard time
[02:07:29.440 --> 02:07:30.320]   wrapping your head around it.
[02:07:30.320 --> 02:07:32.120]   I remember when I first trained with Marcello Garcia
[02:07:32.120 --> 02:07:34.360]   in 2007, I was a decent purple belt.
[02:07:34.360 --> 02:07:36.320]   And of course he mollywhacked me very gently.
[02:07:36.320 --> 02:07:39.360]   And then training him again in 2008,
[02:07:39.360 --> 02:07:40.360]   I was definitely better.
[02:07:40.360 --> 02:07:43.000]   I won the Gi and No Gi Worlds that year at purple belt.
[02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:44.280]   So definitely for the record,
[02:07:44.280 --> 02:07:45.560]   I'm definitely not a Jiu-Jitsu world champion.
[02:07:45.560 --> 02:07:46.800]   I won the purple belt, but like,
[02:07:46.800 --> 02:07:48.520]   that's not the same as winning a black belt.
[02:07:48.520 --> 02:07:50.440]   And a tough accomplishment,
[02:07:50.440 --> 02:07:51.960]   but not in the same thing at all.
[02:07:51.960 --> 02:07:54.960]   But anyway, I was definitely better.
[02:07:54.960 --> 02:07:55.960]   He beat me up just the same.
[02:07:55.960 --> 02:07:57.640]   I'm like, okay.
[02:07:57.640 --> 02:07:59.720]   2009, I was a lot better.
[02:07:59.720 --> 02:08:01.320]   Got a medal at ADCC that time.
[02:08:01.320 --> 02:08:03.240]   Won the trials, crushed everybody.
[02:08:03.240 --> 02:08:06.720]   Like submitted everybody, like bop, bop, bop, bop.
[02:08:06.720 --> 02:08:08.640]   Trained with Marcello Garcia.
[02:08:08.640 --> 02:08:09.840]   It was worse.
[02:08:09.840 --> 02:08:13.440]   And 2010, trained with Marcello Garcia, same, same.
[02:08:13.440 --> 02:08:17.200]   So the idea was I wouldn't be able to tell you
[02:08:17.200 --> 02:08:20.000]   the difference, the outcome difference was the same
[02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:20.840]   in all of these rounds.
[02:08:20.840 --> 02:08:23.520]   I was significantly more experienced and more adept
[02:08:23.520 --> 02:08:25.480]   each time that this occurred.
[02:08:25.480 --> 02:08:27.240]   But it was like, how many number of times
[02:08:27.240 --> 02:08:29.000]   did this person submit you or pass your guard in the round?
[02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:30.280]   I'm like, I don't know, probably like,
[02:08:30.280 --> 02:08:31.480]   let's say five each one.
[02:08:31.480 --> 02:08:33.040]   'Cause it's a brief period of time.
[02:08:33.040 --> 02:08:34.680]   And let's say it was three on one, six on another.
[02:08:34.680 --> 02:08:35.640]   I'm like, whatever, it's comparable.
[02:08:35.640 --> 02:08:37.760]   It's six on one, half dozen.
[02:08:37.760 --> 02:08:40.360]   Would I be able to easily tell the difference?
[02:08:40.360 --> 02:08:42.320]   No, I would just say, I know in concept
[02:08:42.320 --> 02:08:43.760]   that he's way better.
[02:08:43.760 --> 02:08:45.760]   So much better, but there's plenty of other people
[02:08:45.760 --> 02:08:47.840]   that could have beaten me just as bad as Marcello did
[02:08:47.840 --> 02:08:49.960]   when I was a purple belt or when I was a brown belt.
[02:08:49.960 --> 02:08:51.680]   And maybe I would watch Marcello walk through
[02:08:51.680 --> 02:08:53.320]   like their borderline not there.
[02:08:53.320 --> 02:08:54.360]   So it's neat.
[02:08:54.360 --> 02:08:57.080]   Like if you, that's back to kind of what I was talking about
[02:08:57.080 --> 02:08:59.920]   about certain people beginning to really like peel back
[02:08:59.920 --> 02:09:03.280]   some of what's really special about the martial arts
[02:09:03.280 --> 02:09:05.000]   or any activity I presume,
[02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:08.000]   is they get to a level of understanding and depth
[02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:09.320]   that they're playing with like the,
[02:09:09.320 --> 02:09:11.600]   almost the reality of that thing.
[02:09:11.600 --> 02:09:14.240]   And I'm playing by rules that are not rules.
[02:09:14.240 --> 02:09:16.680]   I'm not even one of the, to use a matrix analogy,
[02:09:16.680 --> 02:09:18.920]   I'm not even an agent, which is the best version
[02:09:18.920 --> 02:09:20.520]   of something playing by the rules.
[02:09:20.520 --> 02:09:21.360]   - Yes.
[02:09:21.360 --> 02:09:22.800]   - I'm like one of the regular people
[02:09:22.800 --> 02:09:25.480]   or one of the regular people in that got out of the matrix.
[02:09:25.480 --> 02:09:26.340]   So I'm like, oh, I'm cool.
[02:09:26.340 --> 02:09:28.320]   But when I fight an agent, I lose.
[02:09:28.320 --> 02:09:29.880]   'Cause we're both in the rules,
[02:09:29.880 --> 02:09:32.680]   but they just play them to the bone and I'm just here.
[02:09:32.680 --> 02:09:34.760]   Well, and then the agent encounters Neo
[02:09:34.760 --> 02:09:36.160]   and they can do nothing.
[02:09:36.160 --> 02:09:37.000]   You're like, why?
[02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:39.000]   Because he's operating outside of what the rules are,
[02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:40.200]   but not really what the rules are,
[02:09:40.200 --> 02:09:42.320]   what they perceive to be the rules are clearly.
[02:09:42.320 --> 02:09:43.640]   So anyway, I guess that's kind of my point
[02:09:43.640 --> 02:09:45.120]   about Marcello or certain other people
[02:09:45.120 --> 02:09:46.120]   that are doing things where you go,
[02:09:46.120 --> 02:09:48.360]   that doesn't even seem real.
[02:09:48.360 --> 02:09:49.480]   It doesn't seem real to me
[02:09:49.480 --> 02:09:51.320]   because I don't understand what's going on.
[02:09:51.320 --> 02:09:53.680]   And I guess if we can get down to base assumptions,
[02:09:53.680 --> 02:09:56.840]   if we can constantly strip away, strip away, strip away,
[02:09:56.840 --> 02:09:59.080]   let's say we always thought that turning left was right,
[02:09:59.080 --> 02:10:00.880]   was correct, and it turns out that turning right
[02:10:00.880 --> 02:10:03.000]   was correct, you change your life.
[02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:03.900]   - Yeah.
[02:10:03.900 --> 02:10:05.840]   It's a, what is it, Socrates said,
[02:10:05.840 --> 02:10:08.240]   the unexamined life is not worth living.
[02:10:08.240 --> 02:10:10.800]   So you just basically have to rigorously
[02:10:10.800 --> 02:10:13.480]   just constantly examine every assumption
[02:10:13.480 --> 02:10:14.400]   over and over and over.
[02:10:14.400 --> 02:10:15.960]   - But doesn't that give your life meaning
[02:10:15.960 --> 02:10:18.160]   to come back to the struggle, to come back to free will,
[02:10:18.160 --> 02:10:20.120]   to come back to what if we could strip all that away?
[02:10:20.120 --> 02:10:21.240]   All right, cool, all right,
[02:10:21.240 --> 02:10:23.480]   let me just stick the needle in my arm and that's that.
[02:10:23.480 --> 02:10:24.440]   - Yeah.
[02:10:24.440 --> 02:10:29.440]   No, I mean, that constant striving for understanding
[02:10:29.440 --> 02:10:34.480]   yet another lower layer of the simulation we're living in
[02:10:34.480 --> 02:10:38.360]   is something that's actually deeply fulfilling
[02:10:38.360 --> 02:10:40.320]   that I don't know if it's genetically built in,
[02:10:40.320 --> 02:10:43.120]   but there's something about that striving to understand
[02:10:43.120 --> 02:10:45.880]   that seems to be deeply human.
[02:10:45.880 --> 02:10:47.560]   - But it's funny, what makes it human?
[02:10:47.560 --> 02:10:49.240]   We don't talk about the soul anymore, man.
[02:10:49.240 --> 02:10:50.920]   I went to Catholic school as a kid.
[02:10:50.920 --> 02:10:52.840]   Whether you buy into all that stuff or not,
[02:10:52.840 --> 02:10:55.440]   you're like, what about the soul of a person,
[02:10:55.440 --> 02:10:58.880]   the spirit of a people, the spirit of a nation,
[02:10:58.880 --> 02:11:00.840]   anywhere, the spirit of humanity?
[02:11:00.840 --> 02:11:02.360]   We don't, we talk about everything
[02:11:02.360 --> 02:11:04.160]   like it's this quantifiable thing
[02:11:04.160 --> 02:11:06.440]   when maybe certain things are, maybe everything is,
[02:11:06.440 --> 02:11:07.880]   but then what happens if there's things
[02:11:07.880 --> 02:11:09.920]   that just aren't quantifiable,
[02:11:09.920 --> 02:11:13.080]   that nothing in our understanding can or will ever explain?
[02:11:13.080 --> 02:11:14.480]   And that doesn't mean that that should be our assumption.
[02:11:14.480 --> 02:11:15.960]   It's for your assumption that we can explain everything
[02:11:15.960 --> 02:11:18.400]   and let's get to the dang bottom, peel, peel, peel, peel.
[02:11:18.400 --> 02:11:20.120]   But what if there is actually something
[02:11:20.120 --> 02:11:24.360]   that we need challenge for?
[02:11:24.360 --> 02:11:25.440]   - Yeah, well- - And we could be looking
[02:11:25.440 --> 02:11:28.160]   in the wrong place by going, oh, is it in the genes?
[02:11:28.160 --> 02:11:29.000]   Maybe it is.
[02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:30.240]   Again, I'm not saying we're looking in the wrong place.
[02:11:30.240 --> 02:11:31.680]   I wouldn't know anything, I do karate.
[02:11:31.680 --> 02:11:35.800]   But basically, not even well, but yeah,
[02:11:35.800 --> 02:11:37.840]   we do karate, mediocre, just ask Raymond Daniels
[02:11:37.840 --> 02:11:38.680]   or Steven Thompson.
[02:11:38.680 --> 02:11:41.120]   But I guess to come back though, you just-
[02:11:41.120 --> 02:11:43.160]   - Are you a yellow belt, yeah, or are you-
[02:11:43.160 --> 02:11:44.320]   - Man, I actually have, did you ever see
[02:11:44.320 --> 02:11:47.360]   the Seinfeld episode where Kramer fights the kids?
[02:11:47.360 --> 02:11:49.000]   Yeah, I did that at Raymond Daniels School
[02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.320]   under the kids, kids one in class,
[02:11:51.320 --> 02:11:53.200]   in addition to the alleyway.
[02:11:53.200 --> 02:11:54.040]   - Oh. (laughs)
[02:11:54.040 --> 02:11:54.880]   - Yeah.
[02:11:54.880 --> 02:11:55.880]   - They finished it off afterwards.
[02:11:55.880 --> 02:11:58.160]   - Yeah, exactly, when I was on my last legs.
[02:11:58.160 --> 02:12:02.240]   But yeah, I would just, maybe, it's funny.
[02:12:02.240 --> 02:12:04.120]   I feel like there's something deeply missing
[02:12:04.120 --> 02:12:07.120]   from public understanding and more than,
[02:12:07.120 --> 02:12:09.920]   it's almost like the idea that we can figure everything out,
[02:12:09.920 --> 02:12:12.560]   which I deeply believe in, but also the possibility
[02:12:12.560 --> 02:12:14.800]   that there's some things that we'll never really see
[02:12:14.800 --> 02:12:15.920]   and some things we'll never understand.
[02:12:15.920 --> 02:12:18.720]   And there's something, like you said, uniquely human
[02:12:18.720 --> 02:12:20.440]   about the human experience,
[02:12:20.440 --> 02:12:22.720]   that even if I had the power to change,
[02:12:22.720 --> 02:12:25.400]   I don't wanna fuck with it, man.
[02:12:25.400 --> 02:12:27.160]   I don't wanna change that thing.
[02:12:27.160 --> 02:12:28.680]   Oh yeah, well, wouldn't it be great
[02:12:28.680 --> 02:12:31.200]   if we just immediately knew the outcome of everything
[02:12:31.200 --> 02:12:32.480]   and you just press this button, you're like,
[02:12:32.480 --> 02:12:34.320]   oh, that's gonna, what's the point of living life then?
[02:12:34.320 --> 02:12:35.920]   Even if you could do it, it's the,
[02:12:35.920 --> 02:12:37.200]   and you're seeing Jurassic, well, I'll leave you be,
[02:12:37.200 --> 02:12:38.320]   sorry, I know what I'm talking about.
[02:12:38.320 --> 02:12:40.720]   Ian Malcolm, Jurassic Park, Jeff Goldblum, right?
[02:12:40.720 --> 02:12:43.400]   Life finds a way.
[02:12:43.400 --> 02:12:46.480]   But we were so concerned with whether or not we could,
[02:12:46.480 --> 02:12:48.920]   we didn't stop to think whether or not we should.
[02:12:48.920 --> 02:12:50.880]   Maybe?
[02:12:50.880 --> 02:12:54.520]   - I think there's, I mean, it's a deeply human thing,
[02:12:54.520 --> 02:12:58.520]   but it's also a really useful thing to always kind of assume
[02:12:58.520 --> 02:13:01.720]   that there's this giant thing that you don't understand.
[02:13:01.720 --> 02:13:04.560]   So you can forever be striving to understand,
[02:13:04.560 --> 02:13:08.080]   because that process gives you meaning,
[02:13:08.080 --> 02:13:10.320]   but also keeps making you better.
[02:13:10.320 --> 02:13:12.720]   Like thinking that, actually even just thinking
[02:13:12.720 --> 02:13:15.320]   that you can't understand everything
[02:13:15.320 --> 02:13:18.700]   will lead you to stop too early.
[02:13:18.700 --> 02:13:23.160]   So like, I think there's something to,
[02:13:23.160 --> 02:13:25.960]   whether it's the soul or whether it's like religious stuff,
[02:13:25.960 --> 02:13:28.320]   like assuming that there's this thing
[02:13:28.320 --> 02:13:30.360]   that you cannot possibly understand
[02:13:30.360 --> 02:13:33.400]   is a really good assumption under which to operate
[02:13:33.400 --> 02:13:36.160]   and under which to do this first principles kind of thinking
[02:13:36.160 --> 02:13:38.160]   'cause you can just keep digging and keep digging,
[02:13:38.160 --> 02:13:40.040]   keep digging, even when it seems like
[02:13:40.040 --> 02:13:41.720]   you're at the bottom 'cause you don't fucking know
[02:13:41.720 --> 02:13:43.000]   if you're at the bottom or not.
[02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:44.920]   - And back to your original, back to one of our,
[02:13:44.920 --> 02:13:47.400]   I guess our other kind of tangents was,
[02:13:47.400 --> 02:13:49.360]   that comes back to everyone's a human being.
[02:13:49.360 --> 02:13:52.520]   The smartest human being in the history of humanity
[02:13:52.520 --> 02:13:57.520]   is so hilariously weak, like short-lived and not intelligent.
[02:13:57.520 --> 02:13:58.720]   - You can be yourself, bro.
[02:13:58.720 --> 02:13:59.760]   - I understand, I didn't say,
[02:13:59.760 --> 02:14:01.040]   no, I'm not saying comparison to me.
[02:14:01.040 --> 02:14:02.960]   In comparison to me, everyone is awesome,
[02:14:02.960 --> 02:14:05.080]   but that's why I don't do the goat thing.
[02:14:05.080 --> 02:14:09.440]   But basically, it's just on a cosmic level.
[02:14:09.440 --> 02:14:10.760]   Can you imagine if you were a vampire,
[02:14:10.760 --> 02:14:12.880]   you're like 900 years old, how much you would seem,
[02:14:12.880 --> 02:14:15.960]   you would seem like a lowercase g god to people.
[02:14:15.960 --> 02:14:18.640]   You'd be like, how could you know so much?
[02:14:18.640 --> 02:14:20.600]   How can you have such a long view perspective?
[02:14:20.600 --> 02:14:21.920]   It would be insane.
[02:14:21.920 --> 02:14:24.440]   So I mean, it seems like we're talking about AI now, right?
[02:14:24.440 --> 02:14:26.640]   We're creating things that are infinitely smarter
[02:14:26.640 --> 02:14:28.560]   than us effectively and live all this time,
[02:14:28.560 --> 02:14:31.440]   and it's probably gonna do what we tell it to do, right?
[02:14:31.440 --> 02:14:34.400]   - No, it's probably, well, I hope it keeps us around.
[02:14:34.400 --> 02:14:37.320]   Do you, by the way, think about AI
[02:14:37.320 --> 02:14:39.320]   and the existential threats?
[02:14:39.320 --> 02:14:42.280]   Speaking of gods, are you,
[02:14:42.280 --> 02:14:44.680]   is this whole technological world,
[02:14:44.680 --> 02:14:45.920]   we talked about social networks
[02:14:45.920 --> 02:14:49.680]   and this increasing power of technology around us,
[02:14:49.680 --> 02:14:51.760]   we ourselves are becoming less human
[02:14:51.760 --> 02:14:56.600]   because we keep relying on technology more and more.
[02:14:56.600 --> 02:14:59.080]   So we're becoming kinds of cyborgs,
[02:14:59.080 --> 02:15:03.800]   but also there's a future that's quite possible
[02:15:03.800 --> 02:15:06.840]   where the technology becomes smarter
[02:15:06.840 --> 02:15:09.600]   and more powerful than us humans
[02:15:09.600 --> 02:15:14.400]   and starts having a life of its own
[02:15:14.400 --> 02:15:16.920]   in ways that perhaps we don't imagine as human beings.
[02:15:16.920 --> 02:15:20.280]   I don't just mean like two-legged robots walking around
[02:15:20.280 --> 02:15:22.280]   and being humans but smarter.
[02:15:22.280 --> 02:15:24.560]   I mean like an intelligent life
[02:15:24.560 --> 02:15:33.080]   that's beyond and fundamentally different
[02:15:33.080 --> 02:15:34.480]   than our human life.
[02:15:34.800 --> 02:15:37.520]   It's infinite, it's--
[02:15:37.520 --> 02:15:38.880]   - Also creating a new species, yeah?
[02:15:38.880 --> 02:15:41.400]   - Yeah, a new kind of species,
[02:15:41.400 --> 02:15:42.920]   not even just a new species.
[02:15:42.920 --> 02:15:43.840]   We're talking about systems,
[02:15:43.840 --> 02:15:47.440]   but it lives in the space of information.
[02:15:47.440 --> 02:15:50.640]   It lives in a different time scale
[02:15:50.640 --> 02:15:53.840]   and a different scale of all sorts, spatial scale.
[02:15:53.840 --> 02:15:57.680]   It operate, like we spoke about individuals,
[02:15:57.680 --> 02:16:00.120]   it doesn't operate in the sense of a single individual.
[02:16:00.120 --> 02:16:02.440]   Like it's not embodied,
[02:16:02.440 --> 02:16:04.760]   so it's not like a thing that walks around
[02:16:04.760 --> 02:16:08.040]   and it looks at stuff and it consumes the world.
[02:16:08.040 --> 02:16:11.920]   It's able to do much larger scale sensing
[02:16:11.920 --> 02:16:14.640]   of the environment around it, all that kind of stuff.
[02:16:14.640 --> 02:16:16.280]   - I can barely even try to,
[02:16:16.280 --> 02:16:18.040]   I can barely even conceive of what that would be like.
[02:16:18.040 --> 02:16:20.560]   - Are you scared or are you excited?
[02:16:20.560 --> 02:16:23.320]   - I don't define scared or excited.
[02:16:23.320 --> 02:16:26.080]   I feel like I tend to define them the same way
[02:16:26.080 --> 02:16:29.560]   where I'm like, I guess I'm--
[02:16:29.560 --> 02:16:32.240]   - Kind of like before karaoke, it's the same--
[02:16:32.240 --> 02:16:34.040]   - Well, that's actually kind of my happy place.
[02:16:34.040 --> 02:16:36.560]   It's not so much everyone else's.
[02:16:36.560 --> 02:16:38.720]   Everyone else is probably heading for the door
[02:16:38.720 --> 02:16:40.120]   at that point, but it's--
[02:16:40.120 --> 02:16:43.600]   - While you're doing it or leading up to the karaoke session?
[02:16:43.600 --> 02:16:46.240]   - Well, it depends whether or not they know it's me.
[02:16:46.240 --> 02:16:48.080]   If they know it's me, that's before I start.
[02:16:48.080 --> 02:16:49.600]   If they're like, who's that guy?
[02:16:49.600 --> 02:16:50.880]   Then they're like halfway through the song,
[02:16:50.880 --> 02:16:52.720]   they're already throwing their beer.
[02:16:52.720 --> 02:16:54.880]   - What category is a song or a particular song
[02:16:54.880 --> 02:16:57.160]   are we talking about in terms of your happy place?
[02:16:57.160 --> 02:16:58.160]   - Oh man, are you kidding me?
[02:16:58.160 --> 02:16:59.640]   I mean, obviously "Bohemian Rhapsody."
[02:16:59.640 --> 02:17:00.640]   I mean, there's no question because--
[02:17:00.640 --> 02:17:01.480]   - Really? - Oh yeah,
[02:17:01.480 --> 02:17:02.320]   so I don't have to sing it here?
[02:17:02.320 --> 02:17:04.000]   It's that, it's like, remember, can I beat Khabib?
[02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:05.000]   Oh yeah, of course, is he here?
[02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:05.840]   No?
[02:17:05.840 --> 02:17:06.720]   Yeah, then yeah, yeah.
[02:17:06.720 --> 02:17:08.440]   All right, if he's here, no, then I--
[02:17:08.440 --> 02:17:12.120]   - I have a torn, I have torn feelings about "Bohemian Rhapsody"
[02:17:12.120 --> 02:17:13.960]   'cause I like the beginning part, the sadness.
[02:17:13.960 --> 02:17:16.760]   I like the solo, the heartbreak.
[02:17:16.760 --> 02:17:18.320]   But the second part, I understand it,
[02:17:18.320 --> 02:17:20.120]   but it's so ridiculous. - It gets ridiculous.
[02:17:20.120 --> 02:17:21.920]   - It's so ridiculous, it ruins it for me.
[02:17:21.920 --> 02:17:23.360]   - But it's more about flexing on people,
[02:17:23.360 --> 02:17:26.920]   I think, if you can actually hit that near the falsetto.
[02:17:26.920 --> 02:17:30.160]   - Yeah, so it's not, okay,
[02:17:30.160 --> 02:17:33.000]   so you appreciate not for the musical beauty
[02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:35.160]   and complexity of the song, you just like to flex on people.
[02:17:35.160 --> 02:17:36.160]   - Well, 'cause like for all, yeah,
[02:17:36.160 --> 02:17:38.000]   like what's the purpose of anything
[02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:39.920]   except for just to let everyone know
[02:17:39.920 --> 02:17:41.280]   that you think you're cool?
[02:17:41.280 --> 02:17:45.600]   - And there's no better way of doing that than karaoke.
[02:17:45.600 --> 02:17:47.360]   So I'm not sure why I brought up karaoke.
[02:17:47.360 --> 02:17:48.960]   - Captive audience, yeah, exactly.
[02:17:48.960 --> 02:17:51.600]   - Oh, about fear and excitement of artificial intelligence.
[02:17:51.600 --> 02:17:53.600]   - I mean, you know me, I don't know anything about,
[02:17:53.600 --> 02:17:56.640]   I just, basically, I don't understand
[02:17:56.640 --> 02:17:58.280]   the implications of any of this.
[02:17:58.280 --> 02:18:00.800]   I would just say that like radically altering
[02:18:00.800 --> 02:18:01.920]   what it means to be human
[02:18:01.920 --> 02:18:03.920]   in such an unbelievably short period of time
[02:18:03.920 --> 02:18:06.160]   just seems like such a crazy thing.
[02:18:06.160 --> 02:18:07.560]   And also, it's not like we're,
[02:18:07.560 --> 02:18:08.960]   I can't remember who said this to me recently,
[02:18:08.960 --> 02:18:10.120]   might have been you, I can't remember,
[02:18:10.120 --> 02:18:11.600]   so this is definitely not my idea,
[02:18:11.600 --> 02:18:14.440]   but we're not even going,
[02:18:14.440 --> 02:18:17.920]   hey, would you like to opt in, everyone?
[02:18:17.920 --> 02:18:20.400]   Everyone is being opted in, you know?
[02:18:20.400 --> 02:18:22.000]   And particularly when you wanna talk about
[02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.640]   like large-scale robotics or large-scale AI,
[02:18:24.640 --> 02:18:25.880]   like the world is changing.
[02:18:25.880 --> 02:18:28.120]   People in Senegal are opting in right now
[02:18:28.120 --> 02:18:29.040]   without realizing it.
[02:18:29.040 --> 02:18:29.960]   It's not even like, and again,
[02:18:29.960 --> 02:18:31.080]   I don't mean to pick on Senegal,
[02:18:31.080 --> 02:18:32.680]   it's just whatever country comes up to mind,
[02:18:32.680 --> 02:18:33.840]   but that's in the developing world.
[02:18:33.840 --> 02:18:36.280]   But basically, you know,
[02:18:36.280 --> 02:18:40.840]   recognizing that this huge shift is coming,
[02:18:40.840 --> 02:18:42.760]   we have no idea that this is a decent idea.
[02:18:42.760 --> 02:18:45.000]   And also, something else I've always been considering
[02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:49.160]   is you think about most of the really awful, awful,
[02:18:49.160 --> 02:18:51.240]   awful things that have done in history,
[02:18:51.240 --> 02:18:54.280]   large-scale slavery, you name it.
[02:18:54.280 --> 02:18:57.520]   It didn't, people say that it came from this motivation
[02:18:57.520 --> 02:18:58.360]   or that motivation.
[02:18:58.360 --> 02:18:59.480]   Maybe it did, maybe it didn't.
[02:18:59.480 --> 02:19:01.360]   Fundamentally, the issue, at least in my mind,
[02:19:01.360 --> 02:19:04.080]   I'm not a historian, power differential.
[02:19:04.080 --> 02:19:08.820]   If you and I can't contest, we don't contend,
[02:19:08.820 --> 02:19:11.200]   it's not like we fight and you might win or we fight,
[02:19:11.200 --> 02:19:12.720]   even you'll win comfortably.
[02:19:12.720 --> 02:19:15.960]   It's you are so unbelievably powerful compared to me
[02:19:15.960 --> 02:19:18.800]   that there's nothing I can do to stop you.
[02:19:18.800 --> 02:19:20.360]   That seems like a recipe for something
[02:19:20.360 --> 02:19:22.040]   really, really not great happening.
[02:19:22.040 --> 02:19:24.800]   Because if you think about like, you know,
[02:19:24.800 --> 02:19:26.560]   European countries encountering each other,
[02:19:26.560 --> 02:19:28.080]   I'm just speculating, I don't know anything about history,
[02:19:28.080 --> 02:19:31.080]   but let's say countries that can contend with one another
[02:19:31.080 --> 02:19:34.280]   versus countries that can't.
[02:19:34.280 --> 02:19:37.880]   Let's say an alien species, alien race shows up right now.
[02:19:37.880 --> 02:19:38.720]   We don't want that.
[02:19:38.720 --> 02:19:39.760]   I think Stephen Hawking said that.
[02:19:39.760 --> 02:19:41.080]   That makes perfect sense to me.
[02:19:41.080 --> 02:19:41.920]   We don't want that.
[02:19:41.920 --> 02:19:44.880]   If you can come here, we better hope you're nice.
[02:19:44.880 --> 02:19:46.120]   Because what are we gonna do?
[02:19:46.120 --> 02:19:47.920]   What are we gonna hope that you invade the water planet
[02:19:47.920 --> 02:19:50.560]   like they did in, you know, one of the,
[02:19:50.560 --> 02:19:51.760]   Lord of the, yeah, War of the Worlds.
[02:19:51.760 --> 02:19:53.040]   So I guess what I'm trying to get across
[02:19:53.040 --> 02:19:55.600]   is like shocking levels of power differential
[02:19:55.600 --> 02:19:59.720]   between groups makes the world ripe for horrific abuse
[02:19:59.720 --> 02:20:01.840]   in the event that someone decides to do it.
[02:20:01.840 --> 02:20:04.560]   It's like, like you imagine an adult hitting a child,
[02:20:04.560 --> 02:20:05.760]   like hitting, hitting a child,
[02:20:05.760 --> 02:20:07.160]   no one in their right mind would ever go like,
[02:20:07.160 --> 02:20:08.480]   oh yeah, that's a great idea.
[02:20:08.480 --> 02:20:11.360]   Because it's such an, it's so grossly imbalanced.
[02:20:11.360 --> 02:20:12.960]   You're like, this is wrong.
[02:20:12.960 --> 02:20:14.240]   But it's also on the table
[02:20:14.240 --> 02:20:16.360]   only because of the gross imbalance.
[02:20:16.360 --> 02:20:18.120]   So I guess to come back, it's like,
[02:20:18.120 --> 02:20:21.640]   whether we create AI and it's on some crazy level
[02:20:21.640 --> 02:20:24.280]   of its own, or it's, I'm in charge of it,
[02:20:24.280 --> 02:20:27.600]   or I just, it seems like we're creating,
[02:20:27.600 --> 02:20:31.360]   you mentioned like a game theory and nuclear war,
[02:20:31.360 --> 02:20:32.880]   what prevented nuclear war?
[02:20:32.880 --> 02:20:35.920]   I mean, presumably mutually assured destruction.
[02:20:35.920 --> 02:20:38.560]   I mean, hopefully also humanity and the humanity
[02:20:38.560 --> 02:20:40.960]   and the reasonable, you know, cooler heads prevailing
[02:20:40.960 --> 02:20:43.880]   and going, hey, I can understand the veil of ignorance.
[02:20:43.880 --> 02:20:46.160]   And I don't go, oh yeah, let me kill those guys
[02:20:46.160 --> 02:20:47.000]   'cause I can't.
[02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:48.280]   I go, this is wrong, period.
[02:20:48.280 --> 02:20:51.760]   And in concept, this is not an action I should take,
[02:20:51.760 --> 02:20:54.040]   but it's also nice and easy to keep me honest
[02:20:54.040 --> 02:20:57.000]   if I know that I can't get you without being got myself.
[02:20:57.000 --> 02:21:01.020]   But what happens when I can get anyone anything
[02:21:01.020 --> 02:21:02.560]   and I'm more or less untouchable?
[02:21:02.560 --> 02:21:04.400]   Like that seems to me to be like,
[02:21:04.400 --> 02:21:06.880]   like various times in colonial history,
[02:21:06.880 --> 02:21:07.720]   you know what I mean?
[02:21:07.720 --> 02:21:08.760]   And what happened?
[02:21:08.760 --> 02:21:09.600]   We know what happened.
[02:21:09.600 --> 02:21:14.600]   - But, so the possibility of really bad things
[02:21:14.600 --> 02:21:17.260]   are plentiful, the possibilities.
[02:21:17.260 --> 02:21:20.640]   But are the possibilities of really positive things
[02:21:20.640 --> 02:21:21.480]   are plentiful.
[02:21:21.480 --> 02:21:22.440]   - Like what though?
[02:21:22.440 --> 02:21:23.280]   I'm not saying wrong.
[02:21:23.280 --> 02:21:25.720]   - So I can give a million examples.
[02:21:25.720 --> 02:21:29.300]   One is just the examples of the parent and the child.
[02:21:29.300 --> 02:21:34.640]   You said there's a power differential there
[02:21:34.640 --> 02:21:39.320]   and we don't like a parent hitting their child.
[02:21:39.320 --> 02:21:41.120]   - What about not just hitting, like beating?
[02:21:41.120 --> 02:21:43.160]   - Beating, yeah, yeah, yeah, great.
[02:21:43.160 --> 02:21:44.760]   Beating their child.
[02:21:44.760 --> 02:21:49.160]   How often, percentage-wise, do you see that happening?
[02:21:49.160 --> 02:21:52.580]   Even though that power differential,
[02:21:52.580 --> 02:21:55.040]   first of all, other people's kids,
[02:21:55.040 --> 02:21:57.720]   let's just put this on the table, I love kids,
[02:21:57.720 --> 02:22:00.560]   but other people's kids can be annoying sometimes.
[02:22:00.560 --> 02:22:03.880]   - Sometimes you gotta deal out some justice, I get it.
[02:22:03.880 --> 02:22:05.160]   - But we don't practice,
[02:22:05.160 --> 02:22:07.760]   we don't take advantage of that power differential.
[02:22:07.760 --> 02:22:11.640]   So like there is ethics, there's moralities that emerge
[02:22:11.640 --> 02:22:15.440]   that allow the power differential to be used for good
[02:22:15.440 --> 02:22:16.680]   versus for bad.
[02:22:16.680 --> 02:22:20.720]   So like you're, one of the assumptions with Stephen Hawking
[02:22:20.720 --> 02:22:24.900]   or with if Russia became much more powerful than America
[02:22:24.900 --> 02:22:28.180]   or America much more powerful than Russia in the Cold War,
[02:22:28.180 --> 02:22:31.180]   your assumption that immediately that power differential,
[02:22:31.180 --> 02:22:32.020]   not your assumption, but--
[02:22:32.020 --> 02:22:33.180]   - It would express itself, right?
[02:22:33.180 --> 02:22:36.940]   - Would express itself in the same way
[02:22:36.940 --> 02:22:38.480]   that it was trying to express itself
[02:22:38.480 --> 02:22:41.540]   when there was a more level competition.
[02:22:41.540 --> 02:22:44.340]   But it's also possible when the power differential grows,
[02:22:44.340 --> 02:22:47.620]   the incentive, the joy, whatever the mechanisms
[02:22:47.620 --> 02:22:51.860]   that made sense when it was at the same level,
[02:22:51.860 --> 02:22:54.060]   that the incentives become very different.
[02:22:54.060 --> 02:22:57.020]   It's not as fun to destroy the ant colony,
[02:22:57.020 --> 02:23:01.460]   you start becoming more the kind of a conservationist.
[02:23:01.460 --> 02:23:04.100]   - One hopes, that's an evolved perspective though, yeah?
[02:23:04.100 --> 02:23:06.120]   - Well, I don't know if it's evolved or not,
[02:23:06.120 --> 02:23:07.500]   but it's definitely a possibility.
[02:23:07.500 --> 02:23:09.500]   It's unclear to me that something
[02:23:09.500 --> 02:23:12.540]   that's many orders of magnitude more powerful than us
[02:23:12.540 --> 02:23:14.740]   will want to destroy us.
[02:23:14.740 --> 02:23:18.420]   - Well, I mean, how did mass slavery occur?
[02:23:18.420 --> 02:23:19.580]   How did, you know, like,
[02:23:19.580 --> 02:23:22.380]   it was just big dogs playing with not--
[02:23:22.380 --> 02:23:27.380]   - I think slavery and a lot of the atrocities in history
[02:23:27.380 --> 02:23:32.780]   happened when the power differential was not as great
[02:23:32.780 --> 02:23:35.820]   as we're talking about with AI, potentially.
[02:23:35.820 --> 02:23:38.140]   - Is that not somehow worse than--
[02:23:38.140 --> 02:23:39.420]   - It's not obvious to me.
[02:23:39.420 --> 02:23:43.220]   It's not obvious that things that are way more powerful--
[02:23:43.220 --> 02:23:44.060]   - That's fair, okay.
[02:23:44.060 --> 02:23:45.420]   So I think you're--
[02:23:45.420 --> 02:23:47.700]   - I guess, how do you restrain it though?
[02:23:47.700 --> 02:23:50.300]   - There's a lot of different discussions of how to--
[02:23:50.300 --> 02:23:52.340]   - I guess even restrain each other,
[02:23:52.340 --> 02:23:54.220]   'cause let's say I go and decide to strike someone's child,
[02:23:54.220 --> 02:23:55.940]   which I'd like to think I wouldn't do.
[02:23:55.940 --> 02:23:59.420]   I will be promptly, I will find myself in front of a judge.
[02:23:59.420 --> 02:24:01.100]   And so I feel like there's a lot,
[02:24:01.100 --> 02:24:03.500]   can you imagine how many people used to get murdered
[02:24:03.500 --> 02:24:04.460]   just in the woods?
[02:24:04.460 --> 02:24:05.300]   - Yeah.
[02:24:05.300 --> 02:24:08.140]   - I mean, I would just presume it's a lot, you know?
[02:24:08.140 --> 02:24:11.040]   And I don't think most people are lunatics like that,
[02:24:11.040 --> 02:24:11.880]   but I would just say--
[02:24:11.880 --> 02:24:12.700]   - But that's the point.
[02:24:13.140 --> 02:24:14.220]   If you're given to that,
[02:24:14.220 --> 02:24:17.220]   your ability to get away with it was greater in the past
[02:24:17.220 --> 02:24:19.620]   because of chance of detection was less.
[02:24:19.620 --> 02:24:22.380]   So I don't know, you're gonna be unreasonable.
[02:24:22.380 --> 02:24:24.460]   - This is what's called an artificial intelligence,
[02:24:24.460 --> 02:24:27.880]   AI safety research, called value alignment
[02:24:27.880 --> 02:24:31.260]   of ensuring as you build the systems
[02:24:31.260 --> 02:24:32.380]   that become smarter and smarter,
[02:24:32.380 --> 02:24:33.940]   more powerful and powerful,
[02:24:33.940 --> 02:24:38.260]   make sure that their values are aligned with the entities
[02:24:38.260 --> 02:24:40.580]   over which they're becoming powerful with humans.
[02:24:40.580 --> 02:24:43.900]   So if you were to talk to an AI that's becoming smarter,
[02:24:43.900 --> 02:24:45.060]   first it's dumber than you,
[02:24:45.060 --> 02:24:47.460]   but then it's becoming smarter and smarter,
[02:24:47.460 --> 02:24:50.540]   you have to create mechanisms
[02:24:50.540 --> 02:24:52.620]   where you both value the same things.
[02:24:52.620 --> 02:24:54.060]   - I guess one thing I wonder,
[02:24:54.060 --> 02:24:57.660]   so I guess I'm probably not sharp enough to grasp this
[02:24:57.660 --> 02:25:00.220]   if I'm honest, but I guess I wonder,
[02:25:00.220 --> 02:25:01.620]   I used to do chess programs.
[02:25:01.620 --> 02:25:04.980]   You know, it was deep blue, stockfish,
[02:25:04.980 --> 02:25:06.340]   and then like alpha zero,
[02:25:06.340 --> 02:25:10.420]   and alpha zero teaching itself to beat stockfish
[02:25:10.420 --> 02:25:12.540]   without any help in four hours.
[02:25:12.540 --> 02:25:15.860]   Like it becomes orders of magnitude more intelligent
[02:25:15.860 --> 02:25:19.300]   than us in effectively an instantaneous period.
[02:25:19.300 --> 02:25:21.380]   I guess what I always wondered,
[02:25:21.380 --> 02:25:23.300]   if you were that much smarter than me,
[02:25:23.300 --> 02:25:26.220]   I feel like your ability to manipulate me
[02:25:26.220 --> 02:25:28.580]   would be pretty significant, or at least potentially.
[02:25:28.580 --> 02:25:33.580]   - But manipulation implies that the incentive is
[02:25:33.580 --> 02:25:37.540]   to overpower everything around you.
[02:25:37.540 --> 02:25:39.620]   Like there's implied incentives.
[02:25:39.620 --> 02:25:42.260]   If your value is to actually,
[02:25:42.260 --> 02:25:47.780]   it depends what you want in life,
[02:25:47.780 --> 02:25:49.580]   what you want in your system.
[02:25:49.580 --> 02:25:53.020]   It's not clear that the goal of an AI system
[02:25:53.020 --> 02:25:55.900]   that's all powerful is to destroy all humans.
[02:25:55.900 --> 02:25:57.660]   - No, I don't think that it is either.
[02:25:57.660 --> 02:25:58.500]   I guess what I'm--
[02:25:58.500 --> 02:26:00.420]   - Or even enslave all humans.
[02:26:00.420 --> 02:26:01.260]   - That's fair.
[02:26:01.260 --> 02:26:02.300]   I guess what I'm trying to suggest
[02:26:02.300 --> 02:26:04.540]   is that something adequately powerful,
[02:26:04.540 --> 02:26:06.560]   these actions are on the table.
[02:26:06.560 --> 02:26:08.320]   - Yes, they're on the table and that's scary,
[02:26:08.320 --> 02:26:10.460]   and that's why a lot of people are really concerned about it
[02:26:10.460 --> 02:26:12.020]   and are working on it.
[02:26:12.020 --> 02:26:15.060]   I'm just trying to make the case for AGI
[02:26:15.060 --> 02:26:19.960]   because if they're watching this, he's the one to kill.
[02:26:19.960 --> 02:26:22.700]   - No, actually I was thinking, I was, yeah.
[02:26:22.700 --> 02:26:26.000]   I wash toilets really well.
[02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:26.840]   There's a--
[02:26:26.840 --> 02:26:30.300]   - No, I mean, that's the main concern
[02:26:30.300 --> 02:26:32.580]   for all the people in the AI safety research.
[02:26:32.580 --> 02:26:34.180]   People talk about AGIs.
[02:26:36.820 --> 02:26:40.720]   It's kind of disturbing how little people are working
[02:26:40.720 --> 02:26:44.720]   on trying to create mechanisms
[02:26:44.720 --> 02:26:48.320]   that keep AI's values aligned with ours.
[02:26:48.320 --> 02:26:50.640]   - That's completely unshocking.
[02:26:50.640 --> 02:26:53.880]   - Yeah, we humans seem to do only good when,
[02:26:53.880 --> 02:26:58.560]   you even look at coronavirus, it's like when,
[02:26:58.560 --> 02:27:03.040]   the water has to be leaking from the ceiling.
[02:27:03.040 --> 02:27:04.360]   You have to be, there has to be--
[02:27:04.360 --> 02:27:05.200]   - Fine, fine.
[02:27:05.200 --> 02:27:08.740]   - Blood everywhere, fire, just destruction.
[02:27:08.740 --> 02:27:12.700]   We just seem to ignore completely any trouble.
[02:27:12.700 --> 02:27:13.940]   - Writing all over the wall.
[02:27:13.940 --> 02:27:15.660]   - Writing all over the wall.
[02:27:15.660 --> 02:27:16.500]   This is fine.
[02:27:16.500 --> 02:27:19.180]   - Yeah, I'm sure nothing to see here will be okay.
[02:27:19.180 --> 02:27:21.340]   - But we do all right, especially in the United States.
[02:27:21.340 --> 02:27:23.740]   You figure out, even when it becomes
[02:27:23.740 --> 02:27:27.980]   a really serious problem, taking actions last minute.
[02:27:27.980 --> 02:27:30.900]   There's something about the innovative spirit
[02:27:30.900 --> 02:27:34.100]   that results in a solution last minute,
[02:27:34.100 --> 02:27:35.440]   right before the deadline.
[02:27:35.440 --> 02:27:36.280]   It works out.
[02:27:36.280 --> 02:27:37.880]   - Well, I mean, I don't know how you did school,
[02:27:37.880 --> 02:27:38.720]   probably a lot better than me.
[02:27:38.720 --> 02:27:40.440]   - No, that's exactly how I did school.
[02:27:40.440 --> 02:27:43.040]   - I couldn't be, I was no motivation up until the last,
[02:27:43.040 --> 02:27:44.520]   if you're like, we have 22 hours
[02:27:44.520 --> 02:27:46.800]   to do the entire semesters of work.
[02:27:46.800 --> 02:27:48.120]   Like, let's do this.
[02:27:48.120 --> 02:27:48.940]   - Yeah.
[02:27:48.940 --> 02:27:51.700]   - And you had like 19 frickin' Mountain Dews, and then, yeah.
[02:27:51.700 --> 02:27:53.940]   - Well, that's why you and I are failures in life,
[02:27:53.940 --> 02:27:56.820]   because I just talked to, I mentioned Cal Newport,
[02:27:56.820 --> 02:28:00.800]   with his book, Deep Work, and so on.
[02:28:00.800 --> 02:28:03.360]   He is of the variety of these creatures
[02:28:03.360 --> 02:28:06.960]   that basically does everything ahead of time.
[02:28:06.960 --> 02:28:07.820]   - That's shocking.
[02:28:07.820 --> 02:28:12.760]   - Because he dislikes the, he thinks it's unproductive
[02:28:12.760 --> 02:28:17.780]   to experience the stress and anxiety of the deadline,
[02:28:17.780 --> 02:28:20.060]   because you're just, you're not going
[02:28:20.060 --> 02:28:22.000]   to be your best performance-wise,
[02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:23.880]   and you're not going to do the best work.
[02:28:23.880 --> 02:28:27.040]   So it doesn't make any, it's completely irrational
[02:28:27.040 --> 02:28:29.280]   to function based on the deadline.
[02:28:29.280 --> 02:28:30.920]   You should have a system, a process,
[02:28:30.920 --> 02:28:33.920]   that gets stuff, a little bit of stuff done every day.
[02:28:33.920 --> 02:28:36.720]   Like, you should be, and constantly be,
[02:28:36.720 --> 02:28:38.600]   systematically honest with yourself.
[02:28:38.600 --> 02:28:40.920]   If you say, I'm going to get this stuff done today,
[02:28:40.920 --> 02:28:42.840]   and this week, at the end of the day,
[02:28:42.840 --> 02:28:44.880]   at the end of the week, you have to then reflect
[02:28:44.880 --> 02:28:46.520]   on what you did, what you planned,
[02:28:46.520 --> 02:28:49.100]   and improve that plan, update it constantly.
[02:28:49.100 --> 02:28:51.640]   Update it every day, every week, every quarter,
[02:28:51.640 --> 02:28:53.880]   whatever those durations are.
[02:28:53.880 --> 02:28:55.920]   As I'm listening to this and reading his stuff,
[02:28:55.920 --> 02:28:58.000]   it's like, oh, yeah, I agree with everything.
[02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:00.040]   I'm like, yes, I'm clapping.
[02:29:00.040 --> 02:29:02.120]   But the reality is, and then I go back
[02:29:02.120 --> 02:29:05.040]   and just eat Cheetos and don't do shit
[02:29:05.040 --> 02:29:05.880]   until like last minute. - You didn't have to
[02:29:05.880 --> 02:29:06.720]   be in Cheesy.
[02:29:06.720 --> 02:29:08.760]   - Yeah. - But, uh, uh, yeah.
[02:29:08.760 --> 02:29:11.800]   - Actually, I don't eat Cheetos, but yes.
[02:29:11.800 --> 02:29:14.520]   - But actually, again, not that it'll ever matter,
[02:29:14.520 --> 02:29:15.600]   not that it's ever going to matter,
[02:29:15.600 --> 02:29:17.160]   because he's so shockingly productive
[02:29:17.160 --> 02:29:18.840]   and well thought out that whatever I've decided
[02:29:18.840 --> 02:29:20.760]   to think about trying to monkey wrench in there
[02:29:20.760 --> 02:29:22.920]   is definitely going to be able to deal with.
[02:29:22.920 --> 02:29:24.960]   But it's funny that, again, because you're a human being,
[02:29:24.960 --> 02:29:26.920]   not a god, all of your strengths have
[02:29:26.920 --> 02:29:28.560]   a corresponding weakness.
[02:29:28.560 --> 02:29:30.520]   The less you practice working under the gun,
[02:29:30.520 --> 02:29:32.520]   the less comfortable you are working under the gun.
[02:29:32.520 --> 02:29:34.200]   The more practice you have working under the gun,
[02:29:34.200 --> 02:29:35.040]   the better you get at it.
[02:29:35.040 --> 02:29:36.880]   The downside is you're always working under the gun,
[02:29:36.880 --> 02:29:38.080]   so you're less productive.
[02:29:38.080 --> 02:29:40.080]   Or it's like your work quality maybe drops.
[02:29:40.080 --> 02:29:41.120]   So it's an interesting thing.
[02:29:41.120 --> 02:29:43.160]   It's like, it's almost like, hey, I wonder if this,
[02:29:43.160 --> 02:29:45.640]   I wonder if Khabib Nurmagomedov has a lot of heart.
[02:29:45.640 --> 02:29:47.760]   And I say the answer is almost certainly yes.
[02:29:47.760 --> 02:29:49.880]   But you go, well, he hasn't struggled a bunch.
[02:29:49.880 --> 02:29:51.400]   Maybe he doesn't struggle well.
[02:29:51.400 --> 02:29:52.880]   And it just so happens that he can also work
[02:29:52.880 --> 02:29:53.720]   under the gun really well.
[02:29:53.720 --> 02:29:55.040]   He just doesn't like to do it.
[02:29:55.040 --> 02:29:56.680]   But, uh, yeah, but it's an interesting thing.
[02:29:56.680 --> 02:29:57.720]   It's like, I guess, what is it?
[02:29:57.720 --> 02:29:59.560]   The aristotle, we are what we repeatedly do.
[02:29:59.560 --> 02:30:02.920]   We are all, we're all practicing something all the time.
[02:30:02.920 --> 02:30:04.080]   So I guess it's, it's funny.
[02:30:04.080 --> 02:30:05.400]   I guess that's the question that I have, though.
[02:30:05.400 --> 02:30:06.240]   I would love to ask him.
[02:30:06.240 --> 02:30:08.080]   It'd be really neat.
[02:30:08.080 --> 02:30:11.640]   Is, uh, in certain jobs, I mean, obviously you want
[02:30:11.640 --> 02:30:13.640]   to have preparation, always, always.
[02:30:13.640 --> 02:30:16.920]   But certain things have like a degree of like entropy
[02:30:16.920 --> 02:30:18.080]   in the system.
[02:30:18.080 --> 02:30:21.720]   And you go, I need to practice working under the gun.
[02:30:21.720 --> 02:30:22.920]   And I'm not saying that's what I need to do
[02:30:22.920 --> 02:30:24.840]   because the fighting, it should be, for the most part,
[02:30:24.840 --> 02:30:26.160]   it's a really sterile environment
[02:30:26.160 --> 02:30:27.000]   in the grand scheme of things.
[02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:29.040]   Like fighting in a cage is very sterile compared
[02:30:29.040 --> 02:30:30.680]   to most other things in life, right?
[02:30:30.680 --> 02:30:32.960]   But, um, dangerous, but sterile.
[02:30:32.960 --> 02:30:35.480]   And, uh, unless of course, like, you know,
[02:30:35.480 --> 02:30:37.480]   like the other guy, the ref decides to hit you,
[02:30:37.480 --> 02:30:38.320]   it would be hilarious.
[02:30:38.320 --> 02:30:40.520]   But, um, anyway, I guess just going like, okay,
[02:30:40.520 --> 02:30:45.240]   so at what value do you get out of adding a degree of,
[02:30:45.240 --> 02:30:47.640]   let's say, it could even be planned by someone else,
[02:30:47.640 --> 02:30:50.800]   but junk in the system and you just have to work
[02:30:50.800 --> 02:30:52.080]   under the gun to make it happen.
[02:30:52.080 --> 02:30:53.520]   Let's say for instance, for like police
[02:30:53.520 --> 02:30:56.200]   or something like that, the situation turns left hard
[02:30:56.200 --> 02:30:57.880]   at some random point in time,
[02:30:57.880 --> 02:31:00.040]   and that could happen to any number of people.
[02:31:00.040 --> 02:31:01.960]   So I guess it's interesting, things that allow
[02:31:01.960 --> 02:31:04.080]   for perfect planning or quasi-perfect planning
[02:31:04.080 --> 02:31:06.480]   versus things that are inherently unstable.
[02:31:06.480 --> 02:31:09.480]   And then what are the, what's the psychological fallout
[02:31:09.480 --> 02:31:10.800]   of comfort with that?
[02:31:10.800 --> 02:31:11.640]   'Cause I think a lot of people
[02:31:11.640 --> 02:31:14.360]   that are really comfortable under the gun
[02:31:14.360 --> 02:31:15.680]   let it happen a lot.
[02:31:15.680 --> 02:31:17.400]   For all the good and the bad of that, does that make sense?
[02:31:17.400 --> 02:31:18.680]   - No, that totally makes sense.
[02:31:18.680 --> 02:31:20.960]   And it was, I mean, his answer would be
[02:31:20.960 --> 02:31:23.760]   that you have to be honest with yourself
[02:31:23.760 --> 02:31:26.680]   if it's valuable for your success
[02:31:26.680 --> 02:31:29.160]   to practice being under the gun,
[02:31:29.160 --> 02:31:30.920]   and then you should schedule that.
[02:31:30.920 --> 02:31:32.000]   - Yeah, I think he's smart.
[02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:32.840]   - You should plan that.
[02:31:32.840 --> 02:31:35.120]   You should systematically, and then,
[02:31:35.120 --> 02:31:37.040]   as opposed to doing it half-assedly,
[02:31:37.040 --> 02:31:39.760]   'cause it's, as opposed to letting the environment
[02:31:39.760 --> 02:31:43.460]   choose the randomness, like control the randomness
[02:31:43.460 --> 02:31:46.080]   to where, like, optimize it.
[02:31:46.080 --> 02:31:48.120]   - I would say it's so efficient, it's shocking,
[02:31:48.120 --> 02:31:49.080]   just to hear about it.
[02:31:49.080 --> 02:31:52.640]   - Yeah, no, he's, I mean, the same way you are,
[02:31:52.640 --> 02:31:53.720]   he's annoying in the same way,
[02:31:53.720 --> 02:31:56.460]   which is like he drops truth bombs.
[02:31:56.460 --> 02:31:59.520]   It's like, yeah, yeah, that's so true.
[02:31:59.520 --> 02:32:02.760]   - Yeah, we're probably comparably, yeah, doing that.
[02:32:02.760 --> 02:32:03.600]   No, he just.
[02:32:03.600 --> 02:32:07.800]   - But he's, so his profession requires that.
[02:32:07.800 --> 02:32:09.880]   So he's not just like a motivational speaker or whatever.
[02:32:09.880 --> 02:32:14.280]   He's a theoretical computer scientist,
[02:32:14.280 --> 02:32:18.080]   and he needs the long hours in the day
[02:32:18.080 --> 02:32:19.800]   of doing, like, serious math.
[02:32:19.800 --> 02:32:21.560]   So it's mostly math proofs.
[02:32:21.560 --> 02:32:24.880]   And for that, you have to sit and think really deeply.
[02:32:24.880 --> 02:32:26.320]   It's like really hard work.
[02:32:26.320 --> 02:32:28.560]   Compared to, like, what most people do,
[02:32:28.560 --> 02:32:31.280]   like, even what I, I mean, what I do,
[02:32:31.280 --> 02:32:34.600]   like, programming is way easier than rigorous math proofs,
[02:32:34.600 --> 02:32:37.880]   'cause you have to, basically, you have this machine,
[02:32:37.880 --> 02:32:42.560]   and you have to, your brain to churn out logic
[02:32:42.560 --> 02:32:46.320]   in a focused way while visualizing a bunch of things
[02:32:46.320 --> 02:32:47.840]   and holding that in your brain,
[02:32:47.840 --> 02:32:50.720]   and holding that for 10 minutes, 20 minutes,
[02:32:50.720 --> 02:32:52.680]   hopefully several hours.
[02:32:52.680 --> 02:32:55.220]   And you're not just, like, doing homework.
[02:32:55.220 --> 02:32:56.920]   You're doing totally novel stuff,
[02:32:56.920 --> 02:32:59.060]   so, like, stuff that nobody's ever done before.
[02:32:59.060 --> 02:33:01.720]   So you keep running up against the wall of, like,
[02:33:01.720 --> 02:33:03.720]   fuck, this is a dead end.
[02:33:03.720 --> 02:33:05.440]   Oh, no, wait, is this a dead end?
[02:33:05.440 --> 02:33:07.520]   And, like, that whole frustration,
[02:33:07.520 --> 02:33:09.400]   that's serious mental work.
[02:33:09.400 --> 02:33:11.260]   That's, like, incredibly difficult mental work.
[02:33:11.260 --> 02:33:12.800]   So he knows what he's talking about.
[02:33:12.800 --> 02:33:14.120]   - That's, and it's amazing.
[02:33:14.120 --> 02:33:15.400]   But like you said, he's, like,
[02:33:15.400 --> 02:33:17.720]   this seems like the standard for the quality of work
[02:33:17.720 --> 02:33:19.120]   that he needs is so high.
[02:33:19.120 --> 02:33:19.960]   - So high, I think he has to.
[02:33:19.960 --> 02:33:22.520]   - Anything less than this level of systematization
[02:33:22.520 --> 02:33:24.400]   and organization would preclude it, right?
[02:33:24.400 --> 02:33:26.360]   - So he can't afford the kind of bullshit
[02:33:26.360 --> 02:33:27.200]   that, I don't know about you,
[02:33:27.200 --> 02:33:28.760]   but that certainly I do,
[02:33:28.760 --> 02:33:30.760]   which is, like, last deadline kind of stuff,
[02:33:30.760 --> 02:33:33.840]   'cause you can't do that kind of work
[02:33:33.840 --> 02:33:35.800]   last minute on deadline kind of stuff.
[02:33:35.800 --> 02:33:39.040]   So my question for him in general is, like,
[02:33:39.040 --> 02:33:41.180]   and for you and I is, like,
[02:33:41.180 --> 02:33:44.320]   well, here's these negative patterns that we do
[02:33:44.320 --> 02:33:48.000]   of, like, doing shit last minute and so on.
[02:33:49.140 --> 02:33:51.120]   Is this just who we are now?
[02:33:51.120 --> 02:33:52.600]   Or are there some--
[02:33:52.600 --> 02:33:54.960]   - I don't think I'm really big into free will.
[02:33:54.960 --> 02:33:57.280]   You know, I was thinking that it's mostly predestination.
[02:33:57.280 --> 02:33:58.120]   - Predestination.
[02:33:58.120 --> 02:33:59.160]   - At least in this regard.
[02:33:59.160 --> 02:34:00.760]   - It's the same with, like, communism.
[02:34:00.760 --> 02:34:02.720]   Like, as long as it fits my,
[02:34:02.720 --> 02:34:04.360]   whatever is the lazy thing to do,
[02:34:04.360 --> 02:34:05.840]   I'll just not believe in free will.
[02:34:05.840 --> 02:34:08.020]   - Yeah, I'm not a communist opportunist.
[02:34:08.020 --> 02:34:10.640]   Or that's when that was--
[02:34:10.640 --> 02:34:13.040]   - I'm an opportunistic communist.
[02:34:13.040 --> 02:34:15.640]   And capitalist.
[02:34:15.640 --> 02:34:16.560]   I just do whatever.
[02:34:16.560 --> 02:34:18.080]   Whatever is cool at the time.
[02:34:18.080 --> 02:34:19.420]   - Exactly.
[02:34:19.420 --> 02:34:24.420]   - Let me ask you to examine some fundamental principles
[02:34:24.420 --> 02:34:27.180]   of a particular thing that Joe Rogan brought up to me
[02:34:27.180 --> 02:34:29.060]   several times online and offline.
[02:34:29.060 --> 02:34:29.900]   - Okay.
[02:34:29.900 --> 02:34:34.900]   - Which is that he thinks that the tie that I wear--
[02:34:34.900 --> 02:34:35.940]   - Okay.
[02:34:35.940 --> 02:34:40.500]   - Is something that makes me vulnerable to attack
[02:34:40.500 --> 02:34:42.060]   that you should be,
[02:34:42.060 --> 02:34:44.060]   the reason he doesn't wear a tie
[02:34:44.060 --> 02:34:47.020]   is because he can get choked very easily with a tie.
[02:34:47.020 --> 02:34:48.640]   It's a big concern.
[02:34:48.640 --> 02:34:49.480]   - Okay.
[02:34:49.480 --> 02:34:52.320]   My contention, and by the way,
[02:34:52.320 --> 02:34:54.480]   he wore a suit last time, too.
[02:34:54.480 --> 02:34:55.640]   He didn't wear it on the podcast.
[02:34:55.640 --> 02:34:57.200]   He wore it for dinner later.
[02:34:57.200 --> 02:34:58.320]   - Yeah, I wore a suit the other day,
[02:34:58.320 --> 02:35:00.160]   and I had no socks on.
[02:35:00.160 --> 02:35:01.560]   I didn't realize, yeah.
[02:35:01.560 --> 02:35:02.680]   - You're supposed to wear socks?
[02:35:02.680 --> 02:35:03.880]   - Yeah, that's my understanding.
[02:35:03.880 --> 02:35:04.800]   - Why'd you wear a suit?
[02:35:04.800 --> 02:35:05.640]   Did you go to court?
[02:35:05.640 --> 02:35:07.640]   - No, no, no.
[02:35:07.640 --> 02:35:09.920]   (laughing)
[02:35:09.920 --> 02:35:11.200]   I don't know, I just wanted to play.
[02:35:11.200 --> 02:35:13.120]   I wanted to pretend I was an adult for a day.
[02:35:13.120 --> 02:35:14.040]   - Okay, cool.
[02:35:14.040 --> 02:35:18.580]   So my contention is the jacket,
[02:35:18.580 --> 02:35:22.860]   everything is more dangerous than a tie.
[02:35:22.860 --> 02:35:24.100]   - That's kind of where I was going with that.
[02:35:24.100 --> 02:35:24.940]   That's kind of where, yeah,
[02:35:24.940 --> 02:35:26.180]   this was my first thought, too.
[02:35:26.180 --> 02:35:27.660]   Once the tie becomes an issue,
[02:35:27.660 --> 02:35:29.580]   yeah. - I feel like everything else
[02:35:29.580 --> 02:35:30.420]   is already an issue.
[02:35:30.420 --> 02:35:31.460]   - It's already an issue, yeah.
[02:35:31.460 --> 02:35:32.940]   - Because the tie, to me,
[02:35:32.940 --> 02:35:34.740]   now without messing with it now,
[02:35:34.740 --> 02:35:38.900]   is, to me, has some of the similar problems
[02:35:38.900 --> 02:35:40.640]   that a belt does.
[02:35:40.640 --> 02:35:42.060]   So for example, I don't know about you,
[02:35:42.060 --> 02:35:43.460]   maybe you can correct me,
[02:35:43.460 --> 02:35:47.020]   but I'm not sure you can use the belt as tied.
[02:35:47.020 --> 02:35:53.540]   I know there's some kind of guards
[02:35:53.540 --> 02:35:55.700]   you can probably utilize the belt with,
[02:35:55.700 --> 02:35:58.820]   but the belt, sorry, when it's tied around the waist.
[02:35:58.820 --> 02:36:00.700]   - And you're talking about a belt belt or a gi belt?
[02:36:00.700 --> 02:36:01.540]   - Sorry, gi belt.
[02:36:01.540 --> 02:36:02.580]   - Okay. - Sorry, gi belt.
[02:36:02.580 --> 02:36:04.440]   Importantly, gi belt.
[02:36:04.440 --> 02:36:07.700]   It's not that great of a thing to use
[02:36:07.700 --> 02:36:10.740]   in most cases, I would say,
[02:36:10.740 --> 02:36:12.100]   'cause it slides.
[02:36:12.100 --> 02:36:13.140]   - Yep, that's true.
[02:36:13.140 --> 02:36:16.060]   - It doesn't, you can probably invent
[02:36:16.060 --> 02:36:19.540]   a few interesting ways to use it as leverage,
[02:36:19.540 --> 02:36:21.300]   as control and so on,
[02:36:21.300 --> 02:36:24.180]   but there's just so many more things around
[02:36:24.180 --> 02:36:25.020]   that are better. - Better, better.
[02:36:25.020 --> 02:36:25.860]   - Better suited. - Better.
[02:36:25.860 --> 02:36:27.140]   - Yeah. - And so for me,
[02:36:27.140 --> 02:36:28.900]   the tie, what people don't realize.
[02:36:28.900 --> 02:36:29.740]   - That's better.
[02:36:29.740 --> 02:36:30.820]   Are we trying to sell a DVD here
[02:36:30.820 --> 02:36:32.820]   and have some widgets and bells and whistles?
[02:36:32.820 --> 02:36:34.740]   'Cause in that case, the belt is a really important part
[02:36:34.740 --> 02:36:36.380]   of what we do, and I would really encourage you guys
[02:36:36.380 --> 02:36:37.740]   to look into it. - Yeah.
[02:36:37.740 --> 02:36:40.020]   - If we're trying to actually learn something,
[02:36:40.020 --> 02:36:42.780]   I'd say, like you said, we're surrounded by better options.
[02:36:42.780 --> 02:36:43.620]   - Well, that's the thing.
[02:36:43.620 --> 02:36:46.460]   I mean, it's not obvious to me that the belt,
[02:36:46.460 --> 02:36:48.300]   maybe there's actually undiscovered things
[02:36:48.300 --> 02:36:50.020]   about using the belt.
[02:36:50.020 --> 02:36:52.380]   I think people have used putting a foot
[02:36:52.380 --> 02:36:55.620]   inside the belt somehow, inside the gi belt.
[02:36:55.620 --> 02:36:57.780]   - This is a no punches gi grappling situation, yes?
[02:36:57.780 --> 02:36:58.620]   - Right. - Okay.
[02:36:58.620 --> 02:36:59.440]   - Yeah, I guess so.
[02:36:59.440 --> 02:37:00.280]   - Sort of fairly contrived, right?
[02:37:00.280 --> 02:37:01.860]   - But with punches too.
[02:37:01.860 --> 02:37:04.140]   Okay, let's talk about a street fight with a belt
[02:37:04.140 --> 02:37:06.740]   that's like a jeans belt, like a belt, clothing belt.
[02:37:06.740 --> 02:37:07.860]   - Okay, so I get to take it off
[02:37:07.860 --> 02:37:10.420]   and whip them in the face with the buckle?
[02:37:10.420 --> 02:37:11.580]   How serious is this street fight?
[02:37:11.580 --> 02:37:12.940]   Are we talking like that far in Oklahoma?
[02:37:12.940 --> 02:37:13.780]   - No, 100% serious. - One of the kids
[02:37:13.780 --> 02:37:15.140]   get beat up or are we talking like--
[02:37:15.140 --> 02:37:17.380]   - No, like death, like one of you has to die.
[02:37:17.380 --> 02:37:18.500]   - Oh, yikes, whoa.
[02:37:18.500 --> 02:37:19.320]   - Okay.
[02:37:19.320 --> 02:37:21.060]   - Oh, you ever, like--
[02:37:21.060 --> 02:37:22.420]   - I'm in this situation all the time.
[02:37:22.420 --> 02:37:23.260]   - I understand.
[02:37:23.260 --> 02:37:24.380]   (laughing)
[02:37:24.380 --> 02:37:26.220]   - And there's a reason I'm still here.
[02:37:26.220 --> 02:37:28.460]   - I had something, I had somebody try to fight me
[02:37:28.460 --> 02:37:29.460]   in a Starbucks the other day. - I fight kids.
[02:37:29.460 --> 02:37:30.900]   We were talking about power differential.
[02:37:30.900 --> 02:37:32.160]   - Yeah, hey, I-- - I just beat up kids
[02:37:32.160 --> 02:37:33.580]   all the time. - Just pick the easy Ws.
[02:37:33.580 --> 02:37:34.540]   You gotta get the easy Ws.
[02:37:34.540 --> 02:37:36.380]   You don't want the horrible-- - I'm undefeated.
[02:37:36.380 --> 02:37:37.900]   - I come around the playground, watch what happens.
[02:37:37.900 --> 02:37:41.540]   - No, like to the death, what is their clothing
[02:37:41.540 --> 02:37:43.980]   that's useful, you know?
[02:37:43.980 --> 02:37:45.580]   From my perspective-- - You mean like from your use
[02:37:45.580 --> 02:37:46.820]   or their use?
[02:37:46.820 --> 02:37:48.900]   - Both, from my use to their use.
[02:37:48.900 --> 02:37:52.700]   No, like I like how you went to take the belt off
[02:37:52.700 --> 02:37:54.180]   and use the buckle to hit them with,
[02:37:54.180 --> 02:37:56.740]   but first of all, how are you gonna take off the belt?
[02:37:56.740 --> 02:37:57.900]   - Well, that's actually-- - There's a lot of effort
[02:37:57.900 --> 02:38:00.300]   involved in unclothing.
[02:38:00.300 --> 02:38:02.460]   - Well, what I was figuring was when they started
[02:38:02.460 --> 02:38:04.100]   to see me take my pants off in the fight,
[02:38:04.100 --> 02:38:05.020]   they were like, what?
[02:38:05.020 --> 02:38:07.860]   They're gonna pause and rethink the situation for a second?
[02:38:07.860 --> 02:38:08.700]   - Yes. - And I'm making
[02:38:08.700 --> 02:38:09.740]   dead eye contact, obviously.
[02:38:09.740 --> 02:38:11.540]   - So what's going on? - Yeah, exactly.
[02:38:11.540 --> 02:38:13.460]   Nodding, and then by the time they realize
[02:38:13.460 --> 02:38:15.860]   you took a belt off until you could whip 'em with it,
[02:38:15.860 --> 02:38:18.820]   you actually, you're already one, possibly two steps ahead.
[02:38:18.820 --> 02:38:21.220]   - Okay, so fine, let's not talk about your own clothing,
[02:38:21.220 --> 02:38:22.060]   let's talk about their clothing.
[02:38:22.060 --> 02:38:23.620]   - Okay, I'll take off their belt and hit 'em with it.
[02:38:23.620 --> 02:38:25.460]   - No, but that's much harder.
[02:38:25.460 --> 02:38:26.820]   - No question, but if you can do it--
[02:38:26.820 --> 02:38:29.060]   - While maintaining, I got, no, I just said.
[02:38:29.060 --> 02:38:29.900]   (laughing)
[02:38:29.900 --> 02:38:31.820]   - Like, how did it come to this?
[02:38:31.820 --> 02:38:34.820]   - There's, but the point is there's alternatives
[02:38:34.820 --> 02:38:37.140]   that are perhaps more effective.
[02:38:37.140 --> 02:38:39.780]   In my perspective, this might be clueless,
[02:38:39.780 --> 02:38:43.260]   there's almost no clothing that's more effective
[02:38:43.260 --> 02:38:46.980]   than almost assuming the situation is no geek grappling.
[02:38:46.980 --> 02:38:49.740]   Like, I feel like clothing--
[02:38:49.740 --> 02:38:51.280]   - Particularly when you start to add hitting.
[02:38:51.280 --> 02:38:53.020]   Like, every single time I start grabbing your clothes,
[02:38:53.020 --> 02:38:55.180]   if you start hitting, it's not like nothing could work,
[02:38:55.180 --> 02:38:56.480]   but most of the time, you're like,
[02:38:56.480 --> 02:38:59.020]   why am I not using my arms for something better
[02:38:59.020 --> 02:39:00.720]   than what I'm doing them right now?
[02:39:00.720 --> 02:39:01.560]   - Right, yeah.
[02:39:01.560 --> 02:39:03.540]   - It's very difficult for me to,
[02:39:03.540 --> 02:39:06.320]   I don't know, in terms of just distance,
[02:39:06.320 --> 02:39:08.740]   I can't imagine a case of different distances,
[02:39:08.740 --> 02:39:10.540]   even like situations where,
[02:39:10.540 --> 02:39:12.820]   let's not talk about like,
[02:39:12.820 --> 02:39:16.500]   like a situation where you haven't both yet agreed
[02:39:16.500 --> 02:39:17.800]   that a fight is happening.
[02:39:17.800 --> 02:39:21.260]   - Solid clothing's nice if they have it on then.
[02:39:21.260 --> 02:39:22.180]   - Solid clothing?
[02:39:22.180 --> 02:39:23.700]   - Oh yeah, like something like a good jacket,
[02:39:23.700 --> 02:39:25.300]   'cause you can snatch somebody on their face.
[02:39:25.300 --> 02:39:26.500]   - Snatch, snatch down.
[02:39:26.500 --> 02:39:28.020]   - Yeah, you know, it's like if you took my,
[02:39:28.020 --> 02:39:29.980]   like, you know, like you snap down in judo,
[02:39:29.980 --> 02:39:32.100]   like how easy it is to snap down a beginner.
[02:39:32.100 --> 02:39:33.340]   - Yeah.
[02:39:33.340 --> 02:39:34.820]   So I agree with you, actually,
[02:39:34.820 --> 02:39:37.000]   a tie in that sense might be a really effective way
[02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:37.840]   to snap down.
[02:39:37.840 --> 02:39:39.360]   So like the snap down's really powerful
[02:39:39.360 --> 02:39:43.120]   to change the, like disorient the situation
[02:39:43.120 --> 02:39:45.680]   and give you a lot of different opportunities
[02:39:45.680 --> 02:39:49.560]   for, you know, taking their back, taking them down.
[02:39:49.560 --> 02:39:51.320]   - Doing hilarious stuff like snapping them down
[02:39:51.320 --> 02:39:52.800]   with a tie into your knee,
[02:39:52.800 --> 02:39:54.360]   and then when they come back up doing this,
[02:39:54.360 --> 02:39:55.440]   you're already.
[02:39:55.440 --> 02:39:57.080]   - So yeah, in that sense, I agree,
[02:39:57.080 --> 02:39:58.480]   but not as a choking mechanism,
[02:39:58.480 --> 02:40:00.560]   'cause the concern Joe had is choke.
[02:40:00.560 --> 02:40:02.120]   - I think you could probably choke me with your tie
[02:40:02.120 --> 02:40:03.520]   more easily than I could choke you with your tie.
[02:40:03.520 --> 02:40:04.360]   - Probably.
[02:40:04.360 --> 02:40:05.640]   - 'Cause like, if you get, you can get,
[02:40:05.640 --> 02:40:06.480]   like you get my back
[02:40:06.480 --> 02:40:08.360]   and you can put it around somebody's neck,
[02:40:08.360 --> 02:40:11.560]   you know, like, like, like you ever see a diehard?
[02:40:11.560 --> 02:40:12.400]   - Yeah.
[02:40:12.400 --> 02:40:15.040]   - Yeah, you remember when the super Swedish looking blonde
[02:40:15.040 --> 02:40:15.880]   dude or whatever was,
[02:40:15.880 --> 02:40:19.120]   was trying to choke Bruce Willis with the, with the chain.
[02:40:19.120 --> 02:40:20.920]   And then he ended up getting choked himself with the chain,
[02:40:20.920 --> 02:40:22.120]   if I recall this properly.
[02:40:22.120 --> 02:40:23.700]   But anyway, yeah, like, like that.
[02:40:23.700 --> 02:40:25.360]   But I don't feel like,
[02:40:25.360 --> 02:40:27.240]   I feel like if I start grabbing your tie,
[02:40:27.240 --> 02:40:30.000]   you have too many other great options.
[02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:31.320]   - I mean, I do like the snap down,
[02:40:31.320 --> 02:40:32.480]   you actually made me realize.
[02:40:32.480 --> 02:40:34.120]   - No, I think you, yeah, good there.
[02:40:34.120 --> 02:40:34.960]   - What's that?
[02:40:34.960 --> 02:40:35.920]   - I think you're on the right path with it.
[02:40:35.920 --> 02:40:36.760]   - With a snap down?
[02:40:36.760 --> 02:40:38.280]   - Yeah, particularly if you start with like one of these,
[02:40:38.280 --> 02:40:39.520]   like, you know, like, like you,
[02:40:39.520 --> 02:40:40.680]   like you poke your finger in my chest
[02:40:40.680 --> 02:40:42.480]   and then snap down real quick.
[02:40:42.480 --> 02:40:45.400]   - Oh yeah, 'cause it, it also, socially speaking,
[02:40:45.400 --> 02:40:48.080]   it's not a threatening thing to, you know,
[02:40:48.080 --> 02:40:49.440]   to, to reach for the tie.
[02:40:49.440 --> 02:40:50.280]   It's not.
[02:40:50.280 --> 02:40:51.100]   - Particularly in like a business setting,
[02:40:51.100 --> 02:40:51.940]   you know what I mean?
[02:40:51.940 --> 02:40:52.920]   They'll never see it coming.
[02:40:52.920 --> 02:40:54.840]   - Yeah, 'cause I was thinking choke,
[02:40:54.840 --> 02:40:56.920]   but it's not, it's a really good leverage point
[02:40:56.920 --> 02:40:58.600]   'cause like grabbing a jacket,
[02:40:58.600 --> 02:41:00.680]   the jacket will slide if you try to snap down.
[02:41:00.680 --> 02:41:03.440]   You really have to get a hold, like a really good hold.
[02:41:03.440 --> 02:41:04.680]   - That's a good point 'cause it's around the back of the neck
[02:41:04.680 --> 02:41:05.720]   but what if it's a clip on?
[02:41:05.720 --> 02:41:07.040]   How much of a jackass would you look like
[02:41:07.040 --> 02:41:10.080]   if you feel like, and then they just, they stick you on.
[02:41:10.080 --> 02:41:11.920]   But you ever see the Japanese politician,
[02:41:11.920 --> 02:41:13.000]   or I think it was Japan.
[02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:13.840]   - The judo throw?
[02:41:13.840 --> 02:41:16.720]   - Yeah, it was, the guy was so, he was so calm and cool.
[02:41:16.720 --> 02:41:20.600]   Had like, it was, it was beautiful technique.
[02:41:20.600 --> 02:41:23.840]   The level of, actually the throw was even gentle.
[02:41:23.840 --> 02:41:25.160]   But yeah, it was perfect, it was amazing.
[02:41:25.160 --> 02:41:26.000]   - Well executed.
[02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:26.960]   - Yeah.
[02:41:26.960 --> 02:41:28.160]   - More of our politicians
[02:41:28.160 --> 02:41:29.360]   is just toss the shit out of each other.
[02:41:29.360 --> 02:41:31.280]   - Yeah, we need more Teddy Roosevelt.
[02:41:31.280 --> 02:41:33.080]   Exactly, I like, our politicians like talking
[02:41:33.080 --> 02:41:34.600]   about fighting when it's clear that none of them
[02:41:34.600 --> 02:41:37.200]   have even, they would ever have been in a fight, ever.
[02:41:37.200 --> 02:41:39.440]   - Yeah, somebody was saying Teddy Roosevelt is interesting.
[02:41:39.440 --> 02:41:40.960]   I didn't realize this,
[02:41:40.960 --> 02:41:44.160]   is he's one of the greatest presidents this country's had.
[02:41:44.160 --> 02:41:46.520]   And he was one of the greatest presidents
[02:41:46.520 --> 02:41:49.200]   even though he faced no crisis whatsoever.
[02:41:49.200 --> 02:41:51.000]   He literally willed himself,
[02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:53.040]   like nothing happened during his presidency.
[02:41:53.040 --> 02:41:55.080]   He's just a bad motherfucker
[02:41:55.080 --> 02:41:56.800]   who made really great speeches.
[02:41:56.800 --> 02:41:57.640]   - Yeah.
[02:41:57.640 --> 02:42:00.640]   - So he like, you know, this made me realize,
[02:42:00.640 --> 02:42:03.040]   I was just talking to a historian that like,
[02:42:03.040 --> 02:42:05.200]   most of the people who we think are great
[02:42:05.200 --> 02:42:07.440]   need also a good crisis that they've,
[02:42:07.440 --> 02:42:09.200]   that reveal their greatness.
[02:42:09.200 --> 02:42:10.360]   - But Muhammad Ali, right?
[02:42:10.360 --> 02:42:12.880]   - This Muhammad Ali, I mean, in sports.
[02:42:12.880 --> 02:42:13.800]   - But you know what I mean?
[02:42:13.800 --> 02:42:15.360]   Like the circumstances, what is greatness?
[02:42:15.360 --> 02:42:16.200]   You know what I mean?
[02:42:16.200 --> 02:42:18.160]   It's like, you have to, it's not just your capacity,
[02:42:18.160 --> 02:42:19.840]   it's what you face, right?
[02:42:19.840 --> 02:42:21.800]   It's the quality of opposition, circumstance,
[02:42:21.800 --> 02:42:22.920]   what you overcome.
[02:42:22.920 --> 02:42:24.600]   - So I guess what you're saying is Joe Rogan
[02:42:24.600 --> 02:42:27.000]   is wrong about the tie thing.
[02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:28.840]   - You know, I don't wanna go so far as saying he's wrong.
[02:42:28.840 --> 02:42:30.600]   I, you know, the man's not here to defend himself.
[02:42:30.600 --> 02:42:32.440]   Maybe he has some things that I'm not understanding.
[02:42:32.440 --> 02:42:34.360]   - No, he has not deeply thought this.
[02:42:34.360 --> 02:42:35.840]   This is my main criticism of Joe.
[02:42:35.840 --> 02:42:37.320]   He's not deeply thought to this.
[02:42:37.320 --> 02:42:39.320]   And the MMA journalists will be like,
[02:42:39.320 --> 02:42:41.840]   Ryan Hall says Joe Rogan is wrong.
[02:42:41.840 --> 02:42:42.840]   - And hates ties.
[02:42:42.840 --> 02:42:43.920]   - And hates ties.
[02:42:43.920 --> 02:42:47.640]   They'll integrate Hitler back in there somehow.
[02:42:47.640 --> 02:42:48.480]   - Nice, nice.
[02:42:48.480 --> 02:42:52.040]   - What's, you're talking about greatness,
[02:42:52.040 --> 02:42:56.600]   and greatness requiring a difficult moment in time.
[02:42:56.600 --> 02:42:58.800]   Can you like reflect back and think,
[02:42:58.800 --> 02:43:00.840]   what are some of the hardest,
[02:43:00.840 --> 02:43:04.440]   if not the hardest thing you've ever had to do in your life?
[02:43:04.440 --> 02:43:07.000]   - Well, you know, I think I've had a bunch of things.
[02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:09.440]   You know, I've had a lot of things not go my way.
[02:43:09.440 --> 02:43:10.840]   You know, I've been incredibly fortunate.
[02:43:10.840 --> 02:43:12.920]   I've had a lot of things go my way also.
[02:43:12.920 --> 02:43:17.520]   But leaving Team Lord Irvin in 2008,
[02:43:17.520 --> 02:43:21.240]   which I firmly believe was the right thing to do,
[02:43:21.240 --> 02:43:25.480]   is one of the, that was very difficult at the time.
[02:43:25.480 --> 02:43:27.120]   Not like, not a difficult choice,
[02:43:27.120 --> 02:43:29.640]   but it was because of why I was leaving.
[02:43:29.640 --> 02:43:31.640]   But-- - Psychologically.
[02:43:31.640 --> 02:43:33.040]   First of all, loss in general,
[02:43:33.040 --> 02:43:35.680]   leaving a team, a family, all kinds,
[02:43:35.680 --> 02:43:37.360]   doesn't matter what the circumstances.
[02:43:37.360 --> 02:43:38.320]   - I didn't lose any friends,
[02:43:38.320 --> 02:43:40.240]   but I lost a lot of people I thought were my friends.
[02:43:40.240 --> 02:43:43.160]   And I lost training, I lost,
[02:43:43.160 --> 02:43:44.840]   I'd also had like a really serious,
[02:43:44.840 --> 02:43:46.680]   my wrist only does that.
[02:43:46.680 --> 02:43:50.720]   So like, I had a really serious wrist surgery,
[02:43:50.720 --> 02:43:52.080]   like that I didn't know if I was gonna be able
[02:43:52.080 --> 02:43:53.280]   to compete anymore after that.
[02:43:53.280 --> 02:43:54.360]   I just got my brown belt.
[02:43:54.360 --> 02:43:56.520]   That was a, it was a tough time,
[02:43:56.520 --> 02:43:58.920]   like psychologically, physically, everything.
[02:43:58.920 --> 02:44:01.040]   But I was very, very motivated to do my best
[02:44:01.040 --> 02:44:03.160]   and to push through it and to,
[02:44:03.160 --> 02:44:04.880]   you know, just to carry on in a positive direction
[02:44:04.880 --> 02:44:06.800]   no matter what, in a different direction.
[02:44:06.800 --> 02:44:08.680]   And-- - Were you lonely?
[02:44:08.680 --> 02:44:10.040]   This is the thing about family,
[02:44:10.040 --> 02:44:13.440]   even if it's an abusive family, leaving is tough.
[02:44:13.440 --> 02:44:14.840]   - People are complicated.
[02:44:14.840 --> 02:44:17.720]   And even people that I don't think very well of,
[02:44:17.720 --> 02:44:20.200]   that I think on the whole I don't think very well of,
[02:44:20.200 --> 02:44:23.320]   it's unfair to paint them with one brush.
[02:44:23.320 --> 02:44:25.240]   You know, obviously there's greater
[02:44:25.240 --> 02:44:26.880]   and lesser examples of that,
[02:44:26.880 --> 02:44:28.400]   like the person we discussed last time,
[02:44:28.400 --> 02:44:30.280]   who's an infinitely, you know,
[02:44:30.280 --> 02:44:32.240]   beyond almost anyone that we could ever imagine
[02:44:32.240 --> 02:44:33.840]   meeting in our own personal lives.
[02:44:33.840 --> 02:44:34.680]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[02:44:34.680 --> 02:44:36.680]   - Bloody elbow.
[02:44:36.680 --> 02:44:40.040]   In terms of forgiveness and hate,
[02:44:40.040 --> 02:44:42.640]   I mean, do you have hate in your heart
[02:44:42.640 --> 02:44:44.720]   for people in your past?
[02:44:44.720 --> 02:44:46.040]   - No. - For that process?
[02:44:46.040 --> 02:44:47.840]   - No, I mean, there were definitely times
[02:44:47.840 --> 02:44:49.480]   where I've been negatively motivated
[02:44:49.480 --> 02:44:52.800]   to prove people wrong or to accomplish things in spite.
[02:44:52.800 --> 02:44:55.480]   And I think that some of that is valuable,
[02:44:55.480 --> 02:44:57.240]   if I'd be lying, if I felt differently.
[02:44:57.240 --> 02:45:00.640]   I think particularly, I do really well in conflict.
[02:45:00.640 --> 02:45:02.360]   I'm useless without-
[02:45:02.360 --> 02:45:03.600]   - This is the usual deadline thing.
[02:45:03.600 --> 02:45:04.440]   - I'm useless, yeah, I'm useless-
[02:45:04.440 --> 02:45:05.280]   - You like the chaos?
[02:45:05.280 --> 02:45:06.240]   - I'm useless, yeah, I do.
[02:45:06.240 --> 02:45:07.760]   I'm useless without an antagonist.
[02:45:07.760 --> 02:45:08.880]   I like fighting.
[02:45:08.880 --> 02:45:10.440]   I like competition.
[02:45:10.440 --> 02:45:11.480]   I like being pushed.
[02:45:11.480 --> 02:45:13.240]   I like feeling like if I don't play well,
[02:45:13.240 --> 02:45:14.840]   I'm gonna get hurt.
[02:45:14.840 --> 02:45:16.760]   I have no choice but to play well,
[02:45:16.760 --> 02:45:18.560]   or play with everything I got at the very least.
[02:45:18.560 --> 02:45:21.000]   And I guess I would say, though, is, you know,
[02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:23.680]   as I've gotten, you know, more time
[02:45:23.680 --> 02:45:25.960]   and, you know, lived a little bit longer,
[02:45:25.960 --> 02:45:30.960]   you see, you know, various situations for, you know,
[02:45:30.960 --> 02:45:36.120]   with increased color, I guess I would say, increased clarity.
[02:45:36.120 --> 02:45:40.960]   And, you know, there are a lot of lessons to be learned,
[02:45:40.960 --> 02:45:43.680]   even from times in history or bad experience that we have.
[02:45:43.680 --> 02:45:44.520]   And the question is,
[02:45:44.520 --> 02:45:46.720]   can we take those lessons and move forward?
[02:45:46.720 --> 02:45:48.200]   And that's, again, what I think we're seeing
[02:45:48.200 --> 02:45:50.160]   in sometimes socially right now,
[02:45:50.160 --> 02:45:52.520]   we're forgetting important lessons of the past.
[02:45:52.520 --> 02:45:53.720]   And that's not good.
[02:45:53.720 --> 02:45:55.600]   Not saying, "Hey, I don't get why we,
[02:45:55.600 --> 02:45:57.600]   "why we could be going in this direction or that."
[02:45:57.600 --> 02:45:59.120]   I understand entirely, but,
[02:45:59.120 --> 02:46:00.920]   "Hey, let's not forget the lessons
[02:46:00.920 --> 02:46:02.440]   "so we don't have to learn them again."
[02:46:02.440 --> 02:46:05.080]   Because that doesn't really serve anybody.
[02:46:05.080 --> 02:46:07.120]   And anyway, I guess I would say I'm thankful
[02:46:07.120 --> 02:46:09.200]   for all of the experiences,
[02:46:09.200 --> 02:46:11.320]   difficult and otherwise, mostly difficult, honestly.
[02:46:11.320 --> 02:46:12.520]   Most of the times I remember,
[02:46:12.520 --> 02:46:14.280]   I'm thankful for every loss I've ever had,
[02:46:14.280 --> 02:46:15.800]   particularly the tough ones.
[02:46:15.800 --> 02:46:18.840]   I'm thankful for, you know, for all the relationship.
[02:46:18.840 --> 02:46:20.280]   I've been, many people have taught me many things
[02:46:20.280 --> 02:46:21.360]   and continue to teach me many things,
[02:46:21.360 --> 02:46:23.240]   some of whom are still some of my closest friends,
[02:46:23.240 --> 02:46:24.080]   some of whom are people
[02:46:24.080 --> 02:46:25.320]   I really don't get along with at all.
[02:46:25.320 --> 02:46:29.200]   And some of whom are people I think really poorly of.
[02:46:29.200 --> 02:46:30.840]   Although there's not many of that last group.
[02:46:30.840 --> 02:46:34.760]   What I guess I would say is there's been a lot of things
[02:46:34.760 --> 02:46:38.160]   and opportunities to learn and, you know, throughout that.
[02:46:38.160 --> 02:46:39.640]   And also it's not as if I've never done,
[02:46:39.640 --> 02:46:40.840]   made any mistakes myself.
[02:46:40.840 --> 02:46:43.400]   Now, again, there are magnitude differences,
[02:46:43.400 --> 02:46:44.240]   I like to think.
[02:46:44.240 --> 02:46:46.120]   And I can definitely say that none of the mistakes
[02:46:46.120 --> 02:46:48.680]   that I've ever made have been mistakes of intention.
[02:46:48.680 --> 02:46:50.200]   You know, I've screwed up a lot of things in my life,
[02:46:50.200 --> 02:46:52.680]   but I can confidently and easily say
[02:46:52.680 --> 02:46:55.040]   that I've never had ill intent towards people
[02:46:55.040 --> 02:46:55.880]   as I've done it.
[02:46:55.880 --> 02:46:57.120]   So we sit there and like, man, it's just the right thing,
[02:46:57.120 --> 02:46:57.960]   it's the right thing.
[02:46:57.960 --> 02:46:59.080]   And sometimes I've been wrong.
[02:46:59.080 --> 02:47:02.320]   But, you know, you never sit out with malicious intent.
[02:47:02.320 --> 02:47:04.120]   And I think that when I find that,
[02:47:04.120 --> 02:47:06.080]   I think people do things differently.
[02:47:06.080 --> 02:47:07.760]   When I do think that there is malicious intent,
[02:47:07.760 --> 02:47:09.640]   I have a difficult time forgiving that.
[02:47:09.640 --> 02:47:14.360]   - How does love win over hate, Ryan Hall, in this world?
[02:47:14.360 --> 02:47:16.320]   We talked about social media.
[02:47:16.320 --> 02:47:18.560]   We talk about forgiveness
[02:47:18.560 --> 02:47:23.080]   of some of the more complicated people in your past.
[02:47:24.440 --> 02:47:27.480]   If we scale that to the entire world
[02:47:27.480 --> 02:47:30.080]   before the AI destroys us
[02:47:30.080 --> 02:47:34.160]   and the human race is lost to history,
[02:47:34.160 --> 02:47:35.920]   how do you think love wins over hate?
[02:47:35.920 --> 02:47:37.840]   - Well, I'd like to preface this by saying
[02:47:37.840 --> 02:47:39.800]   I tried to make pancakes the other day.
[02:47:39.800 --> 02:47:40.640]   - Yes.
[02:47:40.640 --> 02:47:42.440]   - Didn't work.
[02:47:42.440 --> 02:47:44.800]   But I'm happy to comment on this.
[02:47:44.800 --> 02:47:47.760]   So basically-- - Wow.
[02:47:47.760 --> 02:47:52.600]   - I think most of the times that I can think of
[02:47:52.600 --> 02:47:55.040]   that I've struggled, you know,
[02:47:55.040 --> 02:47:57.960]   it's, and the times that I've read about
[02:47:57.960 --> 02:48:01.520]   is being unable to see the humanity in other people.
[02:48:01.520 --> 02:48:03.880]   And also, even in sometimes our enemies
[02:48:03.880 --> 02:48:05.520]   and the people that have done awful things.
[02:48:05.520 --> 02:48:09.120]   And you go, what would allow people to do this,
[02:48:09.120 --> 02:48:09.960]   that, or the other?
[02:48:09.960 --> 02:48:11.920]   And that doesn't forgive what they've done,
[02:48:11.920 --> 02:48:13.880]   depending upon, you know, some things are forgivable,
[02:48:13.880 --> 02:48:15.080]   some things are less so.
[02:48:15.080 --> 02:48:16.480]   But you wanna understand why.
[02:48:16.480 --> 02:48:17.600]   It's like, to our knowledge,
[02:48:17.600 --> 02:48:19.480]   demons don't populate our world.
[02:48:19.480 --> 02:48:22.600]   Neither do like literal angels walking around
[02:48:22.600 --> 02:48:24.120]   being actually perfect.
[02:48:24.120 --> 02:48:25.880]   A lot of times, the things that it's,
[02:48:25.880 --> 02:48:28.000]   I find it deeply amusing watching, you know,
[02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:29.960]   people hoisted by their own batard on Twitter,
[02:48:29.960 --> 02:48:32.360]   even though it's gross and it's really unproductive.
[02:48:32.360 --> 02:48:35.080]   It's actually like equal parts amusing and like awful
[02:48:35.080 --> 02:48:36.520]   because you're not happy
[02:48:36.520 --> 02:48:38.320]   that someone's being raked over the coals,
[02:48:38.320 --> 02:48:40.760]   particularly unjustifiably.
[02:48:40.760 --> 02:48:43.040]   But it is funny when it's the exact same thing
[02:48:43.040 --> 02:48:44.560]   they were raking others over the coals for,
[02:48:44.560 --> 02:48:45.920]   not like a week or two prior,
[02:48:45.920 --> 02:48:48.400]   and that's happened repeatedly and will continue to happen.
[02:48:48.400 --> 02:48:51.160]   And I guess I would say, as you mentioned, you know,
[02:48:51.160 --> 02:48:54.080]   a prior, you know, like a recognition of the humanity
[02:48:54.080 --> 02:48:56.720]   of others of that all of us make mistakes,
[02:48:56.720 --> 02:48:58.840]   that it's difficult to understand intention.
[02:48:58.840 --> 02:49:00.600]   I've had arguments with close friends of mine
[02:49:00.600 --> 02:49:03.920]   over text message where both of us ended up super pissed
[02:49:03.920 --> 02:49:07.200]   because we were completely misreading what the tone,
[02:49:07.200 --> 02:49:08.880]   the intention of what the other person was doing.
[02:49:08.880 --> 02:49:11.440]   And even if I was reading it correctly, which I wasn't,
[02:49:11.440 --> 02:49:15.640]   it's so easy to ascribe the most negative possible,
[02:49:15.640 --> 02:49:18.320]   you know, the least charitable assessment
[02:49:18.320 --> 02:49:19.160]   of what they're doing.
[02:49:19.160 --> 02:49:21.360]   And I think that that's such a dangerous way
[02:49:21.360 --> 02:49:22.200]   to live your life.
[02:49:22.200 --> 02:49:24.240]   And it's also just a fruitless way to live your life.
[02:49:24.240 --> 02:49:26.540]   You know, it's one thing to go, hey, why did you do that?
[02:49:26.540 --> 02:49:27.440]   I was pissed.
[02:49:27.440 --> 02:49:28.360]   What did you do?
[02:49:28.360 --> 02:49:29.960]   You just, you did that to make yourself feel better.
[02:49:29.960 --> 02:49:31.300]   I'm like, you're damn right I did.
[02:49:31.300 --> 02:49:34.320]   And have I done that plenty of times in my life?
[02:49:34.320 --> 02:49:36.000]   Yeah, I would lie if I said that I didn't.
[02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:38.100]   You know, why did you punch that guy in the face?
[02:49:38.100 --> 02:49:41.000]   He was going crazy at me and hit me and I asked him to stop.
[02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:43.080]   And then I gave a warning and I put him on his ass.
[02:49:43.080 --> 02:49:44.440]   I'm like, no, I'm not sorry.
[02:49:44.440 --> 02:49:47.720]   But then looking back now with years to sit on them,
[02:49:47.720 --> 02:49:50.000]   like, do I understand why I did what I did?
[02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:51.480]   Absolutely.
[02:49:51.480 --> 02:49:53.200]   Would I like to respond differently now?
[02:49:53.200 --> 02:49:54.120]   Yeah, I would.
[02:49:54.120 --> 02:49:56.000]   You know, and it doesn't mean that,
[02:49:56.000 --> 02:49:59.320]   I think plenty of things that people do are understandable.
[02:49:59.320 --> 02:50:01.960]   Doesn't mean, understandable doesn't mean correct.
[02:50:01.960 --> 02:50:03.560]   Understandable doesn't mean that you go,
[02:50:03.560 --> 02:50:04.400]   oh yeah, that's great.
[02:50:04.400 --> 02:50:07.940]   You go, I could see someone doing such a thing.
[02:50:07.940 --> 02:50:08.880]   But I guess just wrecking,
[02:50:08.880 --> 02:50:11.320]   trying to understand and see the humanity in others.
[02:50:11.320 --> 02:50:12.920]   'Cause if I can't see the humanity in others,
[02:50:12.920 --> 02:50:14.520]   how can I see it in myself?
[02:50:14.520 --> 02:50:15.740]   And also, you know,
[02:50:15.740 --> 02:50:17.320]   how am I meant to interact with everyone?
[02:50:17.320 --> 02:50:18.520]   As you said, whether, you know,
[02:50:18.520 --> 02:50:20.600]   even if we're a society of individuals,
[02:50:20.600 --> 02:50:21.680]   for at least for the time being,
[02:50:21.680 --> 02:50:23.840]   hopefully, you know, in perpetuity,
[02:50:23.840 --> 02:50:26.420]   we still come together as a whole.
[02:50:26.420 --> 02:50:29.100]   And watching, it's weird, like you said,
[02:50:29.100 --> 02:50:31.380]   it's, if I only ask why once, I start with,
[02:50:31.380 --> 02:50:33.760]   stay out of my way and I'll stay out of yours.
[02:50:33.760 --> 02:50:34.720]   Leave me the fuck alone.
[02:50:34.720 --> 02:50:36.720]   You're like, okay, that's fine, Ryan.
[02:50:36.720 --> 02:50:38.480]   But that's easy for you to say living in a society
[02:50:38.480 --> 02:50:40.400]   that doesn't actually function like that.
[02:50:40.400 --> 02:50:41.940]   So it's a little bit cheap.
[02:50:41.940 --> 02:50:43.760]   But if I recognize that that's step one,
[02:50:43.760 --> 02:50:45.320]   is I don't hurt you and you don't hurt me,
[02:50:45.320 --> 02:50:47.280]   but then we go, but how can I help you?
[02:50:47.280 --> 02:50:49.120]   That's step two.
[02:50:49.120 --> 02:50:50.560]   And then it goes way beyond that
[02:50:50.560 --> 02:50:51.740]   and a lot further than I've thought about it.
[02:50:51.740 --> 02:50:53.040]   But I guess what I would just say is, again,
[02:50:53.040 --> 02:50:55.200]   recognition of the humanity in others,
[02:50:55.200 --> 02:50:57.040]   and that we all have different strengths.
[02:50:57.040 --> 02:50:57.880]   We all have different weaknesses.
[02:50:57.880 --> 02:50:59.240]   And you can never really be sure
[02:50:59.240 --> 02:51:00.240]   where the other person's coming from.
[02:51:00.240 --> 02:51:02.040]   But if we approach things charitably,
[02:51:02.040 --> 02:51:05.640]   as charitably as we would hope others would approach us,
[02:51:05.640 --> 02:51:06.720]   I think we'll do a lot better.
[02:51:06.720 --> 02:51:08.400]   And I guess one thing that I read that I liked
[02:51:08.400 --> 02:51:10.680]   that I thought was accurate and unfortunately disappointing
[02:51:10.680 --> 02:51:14.240]   was everyone is a great jury, or rather, I'm sorry,
[02:51:14.240 --> 02:51:17.400]   a great lawyer for themselves and a judge for others.
[02:51:17.400 --> 02:51:18.920]   And I think that's a terrible way to live life,
[02:51:18.920 --> 02:51:20.400]   even if it's an understandable one.
[02:51:20.400 --> 02:51:21.240]   - Yeah.
[02:51:21.240 --> 02:51:22.060]   - I don't know.
[02:51:22.060 --> 02:51:24.640]   - I think probably flipping that is the right way to live.
[02:51:24.640 --> 02:51:28.560]   Being constantly judgmental of yourself
[02:51:28.560 --> 02:51:30.360]   and a defender of others.
[02:51:30.360 --> 02:51:32.660]   And that results ultimately in interaction
[02:51:32.660 --> 02:51:35.360]   that deescalates versus escalates.
[02:51:35.360 --> 02:51:36.360]   - Right. - Yeah.
[02:51:36.360 --> 02:51:38.640]   - And we can all live in a world like that.
[02:51:38.640 --> 02:51:39.760]   And sometimes you're like, hey man,
[02:51:39.760 --> 02:51:41.720]   people that deserve punishment won't get it.
[02:51:41.720 --> 02:51:43.160]   Like, okay, hey, but what do they say?
[02:51:43.160 --> 02:51:45.360]   Better to have 10 guilty people go free
[02:51:45.360 --> 02:51:47.700]   than one innocent person burn.
[02:51:47.700 --> 02:51:51.400]   And ultimately, I think that is a better world
[02:51:51.400 --> 02:51:53.440]   than the other way around.
[02:51:53.440 --> 02:51:57.280]   - And if all else fails, join the team
[02:51:57.280 --> 02:51:59.560]   that builds the AI that kills all humans.
[02:51:59.560 --> 02:52:00.400]   - Yeah, obviously.
[02:52:00.400 --> 02:52:02.000]   I mean, if you have to be on a team, pick the winning team.
[02:52:02.000 --> 02:52:02.840]   What, that's been the--
[02:52:02.840 --> 02:52:04.760]   - That's my hiring pitch, actually.
[02:52:04.760 --> 02:52:05.840]   - That's a good hiring pitch.
[02:52:05.840 --> 02:52:07.160]   You still taking resumes?
[02:52:08.360 --> 02:52:10.960]   - You wanna be on the team that doesn't die
[02:52:10.960 --> 02:52:12.240]   during the great apocalypse.
[02:52:12.240 --> 02:52:13.060]   - Not immediately.
[02:52:13.060 --> 02:52:15.960]   You wanna be on the one that's eventually long-suffering
[02:52:15.960 --> 02:52:17.080]   and stepped on, right?
[02:52:17.080 --> 02:52:17.920]   - Yeah.
[02:52:17.920 --> 02:52:19.560]   Life is suffering, Ryan Hall.
[02:52:19.560 --> 02:52:21.720]   This was an amazing conversation.
[02:52:21.720 --> 02:52:22.800]   I really enjoyed talking to you.
[02:52:22.800 --> 02:52:24.560]   I could probably talk to you for many more hours.
[02:52:24.560 --> 02:52:26.540]   I hope I do as well.
[02:52:26.540 --> 02:52:28.260]   Ryan, I love you, buddy.
[02:52:28.260 --> 02:52:29.340]   This was a great conversation.
[02:52:29.340 --> 02:52:30.400]   Thanks for talking to me.
[02:52:30.400 --> 02:52:31.240]   - Thank you so much for having me.
[02:52:31.240 --> 02:52:33.000]   I really appreciate it.

[02:52:50.580 --> 02:52:53.280]   from Frank Herbert in Dune.
[02:52:53.280 --> 02:52:54.940]   "I must not fear.
[02:52:54.940 --> 02:52:57.060]   "Fear is the mind killer.
[02:52:57.060 --> 02:53:01.000]   "Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration.
[02:53:01.000 --> 02:53:02.760]   "I will face my fear.
[02:53:02.760 --> 02:53:05.740]   "I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
[02:53:05.740 --> 02:53:07.380]   "And when it has gone past,
[02:53:07.380 --> 02:53:10.580]   "I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
[02:53:10.580 --> 02:53:14.160]   "Where the fear has gone, there will be nothing.
[02:53:14.160 --> 02:53:15.740]   "Only I will remain."
[02:53:15.740 --> 02:53:19.520]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
