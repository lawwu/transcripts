[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.620]   So, the illusoriness of the self doesn't cut against any of those obvious facts.
[00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.200]   So the sense of self that is illusory, and again, we might want to talk about self in
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.600]   other modes because there's just a lot of interest there psychologically and ultimately
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.380]   scientifically.
[00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.860]   The thing that doesn't exist, it certainly doesn't exist as it seems, and I would want
[00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:35.860]   to argue that it actually is just a proper illusion, is the sense that there is a subject
[00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.580]   interior to experience, in addition to experience.
[00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:44.160]   So most people feel like they're having an experience of the world, and they're having
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.060]   an experience of their bodies in the world.
[00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:53.500]   And in addition to that, they feel that they are a subject internal to the body, and very
[00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.660]   likely in the head.
[00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.900]   Most people feel like they're behind their face as a kind of locus of awareness and thought
[00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:07.420]   and intention, and it's almost like you're a passenger inside your body.
[00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.180]   Most people don't feel identical to their bodies, and they can imagine, and this is
[00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:18.260]   sort of the origin, the psychological origin, the folk psychological origin of a sense that
[00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.100]   there might be a soul that could survive the death of the body.
[00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.700]   Most people are what my friend Paul Bloom calls common-sense dualists, right?
[00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.080]   The default expectation seems to be that whatever the relationship between the mind and the
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:39.700]   body, there's some promise of separability there, right?
[00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.380]   And whenever you really push hard on the science side and say, "Well, no, the mind is really
[00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.860]   just what the brain is doing," that begins to feel more and more counterintuitive to
[00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:56.420]   people, and there still seems some residual mystery that, you know, at death, maybe something
[00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.620]   is going to lift off the brain and go elsewhere, right?
[00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.700]   So there's this sense of dualism that many people have, and obviously that's supported
[00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.380]   by many religious beliefs.
[00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.160]   But this feeling, it's a very peculiar starting point.
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.580]   People feel that, you know, they don't feel identical to their experience, right?
[00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:19.860]   It's a matter of experience.
[00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.940]   They feel like they're on the edge of experience, somehow appropriating it from the side.
[00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.600]   You're kind of on the edge of the world, and the world is out there.
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:35.380]   Your body is, in some sense, an object in the world, which, you know, it's different
[00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.380]   from the world.
[00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.900]   You know, the boundary of your skin is still meaningful.
[00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.900]   You can sort of loosely control your body.
[00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:42.900]   I mean, you can't control it.
[00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.620]   You can control your gross, you know, and subtle, you know, voluntary motor movements,
[00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.740]   but you can't, you're not controlling everything your body is doing.
[00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:57.140]   You're not controlling your heartbeat and your, you know, your hormonal secretions and
[00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.140]   all of that.
[00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.780]   And so there's a lot that's going on that is in the dark for you.
[00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:08.580]   And then you give someone an instruction to meditate, say, and you say, "Okay, let's examine
[00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.220]   all of this from the first person's side.
[00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.780]   Let's look for this thing you're calling I."
[00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.540]   And again, I is not identical to the body.
[00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.600]   People feel like their hands are out there, and if they're going to meditate, they're
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.420]   going to close their eyes, very likely, and now they're going to pay attention to something.
[00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.980]   They're going to pay attention to the breath or to sounds.
[00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.100]   And it's from the point of view of being a locus of attention that is now aiming attention
[00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:38.180]   strategically at an object like the breath, that there's this dualism that is set up.
[00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:44.300]   And ultimately, the ultimate promise of meditation, I mean, there are really two levels at which
[00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.140]   you could be interested in meditation.
[00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.140]   One is, you know, very straightforward and remedial and non-paradoxical and very well
[00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:58.140]   subscribed and it's the usual set of claims about all the benefits you're going to get
[00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.140]   from meditation, right?
[00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.260]   So you're going to lower your stress and you're going to increase your focus and you're going
[00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.980]   to, you know, stave off cortical thinning and there's all kinds of good things that
[00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.520]   science is saying meditation will give you.
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.100]   And none of that entails really drilling down on this paradoxical claim that the self is
[00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.820]   an illusion or anything else of that sort.
[00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:25.740]   But from my point of view, the real purpose of meditation and its real promise is not
[00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.340]   in this long list of benefits.
[00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.180]   And, you know, I'm not discounting any of those, though, you know, the science for many
[00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.120]   of them is quite provisional.
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.780]   It's in this deeper claim that if you look for this thing you're calling I, if you look
[00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:46.820]   for the sense that there's a thinker in addition to the mirror rising of the next thought,
[00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.340]   say, you won't find that thing.
[00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:56.220]   And you can, what's more, you can not find it in a way that's conclusive and that matters,
[00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.220]   right?
[00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:05.440]   And it has a, there's a host of benefits that follow from that discovery, which are quite
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.840]   a bit deeper and more interesting than engaging meditation on the side of its benefits, you
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.540]   know, de-stressing, increasing focus and all the rest.
