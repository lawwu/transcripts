[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.160]   Podcast listener Josh in Kelowna, Canada writes in, "Hello Pastor John, do we have any indication
[00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.520]   that the authors of the Bible matured in doctrine, ministry, or in their experience of the Christian
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.520]   life?
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.200]   For example, should we expect to see a progression of clarity from the earlier writings of, say,
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.500]   Paul, to his later writings with this ongoing study of the Old Testament scripture combined
[00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.440]   with direct revelation he received from Christ early in his ministry have changed or altered
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.520]   his earlier opinions or viewpoints?
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.320]   I'm not saying that his earlier writings would have been false or wrong, but wouldn't greater
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.160]   clarity have come over time as he saw deeper meaning and more connections?
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.600]   Or does the doctrine of inspiration somehow hedge against this line of thinking?"
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.520]   What would you say to Josh?
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:59.060]   Let me try to say something on a principle of reading or interpretation, which I think
[00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:05.140]   helps us not go down unfruitful rabbit trails.
[00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:12.500]   And I'm relating this to a larger issue that I see, and we'll try to bore in on the particular
[00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.340]   issue of a maturing biblical writer.
[00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.620]   What I have in mind with this principle that I'm talking about is the tendency, a bad tendency,
[00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:33.460]   I think, to take our focus off of the text of Scripture and put it on influences that
[00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:42.140]   may or may not have shaped the biblical writers, but in fact, which we only have access to
[00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.560]   through the text themselves.
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:53.060]   Or in some cases, we may have some modest access outside the biblical text to a cultural
[00:01:53.060 --> 00:02:01.960]   or a personal circumstance that may have influenced a biblical writer, but whether in fact that
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:10.300]   externally known situation actually did shape the mind of the writer can only be known from
[00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.520]   the text that he wrote.
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:23.820]   So I have read far too many unwarranted pronouncements that such and such was the situation at that
[00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.580]   time, and therefore the writer meant such and such.
[00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:37.840]   And that simply does not follow unless the writer in his text shows us that he was influenced
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.580]   by such and such.
[00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:48.420]   So I'm very wary of people asserting that the meaning of a text is such and such because
[00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.640]   of something they claim to know about the circumstance of the writer, when in fact the
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.940]   decisive knowledge about that circumstance comes through the writer himself, through
[00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.060]   the text itself.
[00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:09.740]   So the principle that follows from that observation and that concern is that we should put primary—this
[00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:17.940]   is kind of John Piper principle number one—we should put primary and decisive emphasis
[00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:28.760]   on construing the text as we have it, allowing any situational factors to help us only if
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:36.420]   the author shows us in some way that those situational factors are in fact important
[00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.020]   for understanding what he wrote.
[00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:46.300]   So you get from the text a situation at Corinth, say, or at Thessalonica, which you do, but
[00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.080]   you get it from what Paul himself says.
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:58.020]   So the particular circumstance that Josh is talking about is the extra-textual possibility
[00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:05.340]   that an author's maturing over the years might affect his understanding of reality,
[00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:12.700]   which might alter in some way how he treats that reality in the inspired text of Scripture.
[00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:20.660]   And my point is that the only way we could know this is if the author showed us in some
[00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:31.820]   way that his different way of expressing himself was owing to his growth in the maturing of
[00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:32.820]   his understanding.
[00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:39.620]   Otherwise, we'll only be guessing that the way he expresses himself in a later writing
[00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.960]   is different from the way he expressed himself in an earlier writing because of a growth
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.620]   in maturity.
[00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:47.940]   But we may be wrong.
[00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.380]   We don't know that unless he tells us.
[00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.220]   There may be other factors that cause him to express himself differently.
[00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:02.900]   And of course, the same question concerning growth and maturity could be asked about senility
[00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.580]   or weariness or depression or conflict.
[00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:14.420]   In other words, a biblical author could walk through any of those personal experiences
[00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:21.460]   in such a way that how he expresses himself in one year would be different from the way
[00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.900]   he expressed himself in another year.
[00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:33.060]   And one can think of almost endless possibilities of personal and circumstantial factors that
[00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:39.340]   would cause a writer to express himself with greater or lesser clarity or depth at different
[00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:40.940]   times in his life.
[00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:48.380]   So what it really comes down to is whether the claim of Scripture to be written by divine
[00:05:48.380 --> 00:06:00.220]   inspiration implies such a safeguard against error that whatever the personal and circumstantial
[00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:09.520]   factors are in a writer's life, God is so guiding his words that those factors won't
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.620]   compromise the truthfulness and usefulness of Scripture.
[00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:18.820]   And that is, in fact, what I think the doctrine of inspiration as taught in the Bible does
[00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.080]   imply.
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:26.660]   So Paul says in 2 Timothy 3, "All Scripture is inspired or breathed out by God," that's
[00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:33.420]   one thing, secondly, "and therefore profitable for teaching, reproof, correction, training,
[00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:37.180]   and righteousness that the man of God may be complete and equipped for every good work."
[00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.980]   He says two things about Scripture.
[00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:43.980]   One is that it's breathed out by God, it's inspired by God, guided by God, controlled
[00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:49.180]   by God, which means controlled by God's character, which is truth and reliability.
[00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.260]   So that's one thing he's saying.
[00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:55.900]   And then he says, "And so it's profitable, it's useful, it's helpful."
[00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:04.460]   So those two important things, it seems to me, imply that we should not be distracted
[00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:12.340]   from the actual text of Scripture by trying to figure out what personal or circumstantial
[00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:19.340]   factors outside the text may have shaped the text, unless the text itself indicates that
[00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:25.220]   those factors are significant, and then we'll know from the text itself rather than kind
[00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:30.620]   of sleuthing around behind the text and thinking we can find it another way.
[00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:36.700]   Generally speaking, I would say that if we see something in 2 Timothy—that's the last
[00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:44.620]   letter Paul wrote—that is different, not contradictory, just different from Galatians
[00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:52.820]   or 1 Thessalonians, two of the earliest letters of Paul, we would be spinning our wheels in
[00:07:52.820 --> 00:08:01.420]   an unhelpful way to devote very much energy to trying to discern if this difference were
[00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:11.460]   owing to Paul's being older or more mature or depressed or in conflict or tired or whatever.
[00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:17.580]   A far more fruitful question would be, what are the differences?
[00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.100]   How do they compare?
[00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.180]   How do they contrast?
[00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:26.100]   What new and deeper things do we learn about the reality being described?
[00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:31.780]   Because now we have two descriptions, not just one, and the reason for this approach
[00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:38.980]   is that it will be pure speculation to try to guess whether the differences are owing
[00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:43.460]   to maturity or some other factor, unless he tells us.
[00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:44.460]   And it's not useful.
[00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:46.140]   It's not useful for preaching.
[00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:53.060]   It's not useful for personal devotions to diminish our authority by guesswork, which
[00:08:53.060 --> 00:09:00.060]   is what really bothers me about a lot of the way people approach the Bible these days.
[00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:06.100]   There's just so much guesswork in what people are doing with text.
[00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:14.820]   So in summary, my answer is we simply do not know whether Paul had a deeper grasp of reality
[00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:19.900]   near the end of his life than he did at the middle of it.
[00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:24.260]   That may sound strange because you might just assume, "Oh, goodness, don't you grow?"
[00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:25.860]   Well, no, no.
[00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:30.140]   You might be at your peak at age 40 and going downhill from there.
[00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:31.820]   I'm 70, okay?
[00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:41.060]   I know that I'm in some ways not as sharp, probably, and as insightful as I once was.
[00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:42.660]   There is a kind of wisdom.
[00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:47.980]   Maybe aging takes some people backward, not forward.
[00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:54.980]   But either way, either way, how that affected his writing can only be determined by actually
[00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:59.940]   attending to the writing itself, not speculating about the causes of why the writing is the
[00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:00.940]   way it is.
[00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:08.940]   God ordained for the writing to be what it is, old or young, middle or aged, and he did
[00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:15.100]   not reveal all the personal and circumstantial reasons why the writing is the way it is.
[00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:22.660]   So as Isaiah says, "To the teaching and to the testimony, minimize speculation, maximize
[00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:25.780]   observation, observation, observation."
[00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:28.020]   Yeah, very good.
[00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:34.180]   For the record, at 39, I'm nowhere as sharp as you are at 70.
[00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:37.900]   Also for the record, I should ask, Pastor John, to your knowledge, does Paul ever tell
[00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:42.260]   us that his thinking has changed or matured?
[00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:43.260]   Not that I know of.
[00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:44.700]   Thank you, Pastor John.
