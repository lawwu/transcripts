[00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:46.560]   Is that a good summary of your basic argument as you put it to me in that series of tweets?
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:53.980]   No, those are all supporting points in a bigger argument. They're important points.
[00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:59.460]   I think that I've lived in Washington, D.C. I didn't grow up here, but I've lived here
[00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:06.460]   for 30 plus years. I have learned a lot about what kind of the vast majority of people who
[00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:07.080]   live in Washington, D.C. are.
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.080]   What's your take on that?

I forget her name, but let's assume that you're speaking to somebody. And so if you were given the same platform that I have, and you feel like my shaming that mother and using strong and strong emphatic language, things like that is inappropriate. What would you say?

[00:14:58.180 --> 00:14:58.200]   I think there are times in which you metaphorically want to slap somebody across the face, right? There are times in which that can be an effective communication tactic. There are times in which that's exactly the worst thing that you could possibly do. And if you do that in that circumstance, then you can really cause all kinds of problems and really hurt somebody. And so in general, when you create content for a public audience, it's very difficult to know who the person is.

[00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:59.620]   Yeah, a couple things maybe that we'll come back to.
[00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:03.620]   I agree with you totally about the methodology.
[00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:09.620]   I think a lot about how we, you know, we all have to build personas for ourselves.
[00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:23.620]   Whether you're a blogger or not, even just an ordinary person with a Twitter, builds a little bit of a persona for, you know, who they represent themselves to be in those social settings versus like, we're all much more complex than that, obviously.
[00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:24.620]   We're all much more complex than that, obviously.
[00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:35.060]   sometimes
[00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:53.560]   Ð¢Ð°ÐºÐ¶Ðµ Se see,
[00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:22.540]   and
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:51.520]   and
[00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:23.920]   is a very good question.
[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:40.040]   And it will tell you what housing plus transportation costs on average for people living in that city. So I'm looking at San Francisco and most people living in San Francisco are spending forty one percent of their income. So that's what that's an average, right? So some people are spending a lot more, some people left forty one percent of their take home income is going only to housing and transportation in Dallas. It's forty four percent in Cleveland. It's thirty nine percent.
[00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:41.240]   Um
[00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:41.260]   um
[00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:41.600]   um

[00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:25.660]   of the other person. And so, if you have a job that is a little bit more difficult, then you're going to be in and out of work. But if they are holding down jobs, they may not have access to all the terrific jobs that other people have. And they're spending about 40 to 50 percent sometimes before they even get home, right? So, in that scenario, it becomes really difficult. And mind you, if you have one setback, 40 percent of Americans, it's a much quoted, cited figure, 40 percent of Americans are about 400,000.

[00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:52.740]   We're bringing in a lot of different factors. I hope you can edit me to sound really super smart. But my main takeaway is when I started, I come at this from a place of deep shame myself because I've had a lot of advantages and yet I was just in a lot of debt, partly because of personal situations and partly, I think, because of some bad decisions. When I really began to look at how hard it is to save every month, that is number one when I started to get really, really tired.
[00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:52.740]   That is number one when I started to get really, really tired.

[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:34.000]   I concede the point that many people have experienced intense trauma that makes them psychologically unequipped or poorly equipped to deal with the challenges of the modern world.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.580]   I concede all of those points.
[00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:43.460]   And yet, once we go through that, you still have to come to a point of saying, well, what do I do?
[00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:50.040]   And I also happily concede that personal responsibility is not a panacea.
[00:26:50.180 --> 00:27:20.200]  , but it's not something that just simply solves everything.
[00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:20.200]   You can take personal responsibility.
[00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:20.200]   I could take personal responsibility for everything in my life and still be diagnosed with cancer.
[00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:20.200]   It happens all the time.
[00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:20.200]   I could take personal responsibility for everything that happens in my life, be hit by a drunk driver and become a quadriplegic. So we all have to concede as in some ways obvious, but of course useful to acknowledge that we all have to concede.

[00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:54.980]   I was going to do yet another show, which is a common theme on Radical Personal Finance.
[00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:57.700]   Yet another show on the federal debt.
[00:41:57.700 --> 00:42:01.260]   We are in an incredible territory for the last year.
[00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:03.880]   In 2018, the federal deficit.
[00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:34.100]  , which is almost a trillion dollars.
[00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:34.100]   It's on track for that in 2019.
[00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:34.100]   And yet, we are arguing about $5.7 billion over funding for a border wall and ignoring a trillion dollar deficit. And unfortunately, basically, we have two political parties. Those who want to spend all the money times three and those who want to spend all the money times two. And there's really no functional difference between those because at the end of the day, we're past all the money. The money is gone.
[00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:34.100]   And there's really no functional difference between those because at the end of the day, we're past all the money. The money is gone.

How do we help individuals to survive the decline and collapse of the American Empire? Now, how do you and I as individuals succeed in the face of collapse? And how do we help those around us who we can affect succeed in the face of collapse? And that's my question. I assume at this point that it's a fact that the American Empire will die and is dying and it will take several decades until it ultimately dies. Now, how do I help individual people prosper in the face of that? Because at the end of the day, when individuals are dying, they're not going to be able to survive. So, I think that's a great question.

[00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:31.740]   I'm taking it all in, but I'm assuming it's a rhetorical statement.
[00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:35.300]   I'm not sure you need anything from me on this just now, do you?
[00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:36.640]   No, yeah, yeah, correct.
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:40.700]   I was just giving you an opportunity to, if you have any response, I was just giving
[00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:41.180]   you an opportunity.

[00:45:41.980 --> 00:45:43.900]   I do have some thoughts.
[00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:49.500]   They're not especially well formulated, so I don't spend very much of my time.
[00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:57.720]   Interestingly, I do spend a lot of my time on the macro forces that have brought us to this

I would rather deal, me personally, I would rather deal with the local thugs who may or may not have badges than ever deal with the federal thugs who control everything. And that's the problem. Is that if you have a virtuous people, of course it sounds like a good thing, but if you have a good person, then you're not going to be able to control everything. So I don't mind a good liberal argument.
