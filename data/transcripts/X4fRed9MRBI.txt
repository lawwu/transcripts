[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.380]   This is kind of another weird one.
[00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.540]   But within the health and fitness world, I think there are a handful
[00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.940]   of diagnostics that might make sense to give someone.
[00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.140]   So, for example, high cholesterol runs in our family.
[00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:16.380]   So I gave a lot of people in our family a LP little a blood test.
[00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.620]   And I just ordered it up at LabCorp Quest, whichever was closer
[00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.380]   to a lot of people, so they knew that kind of reminds me of how lots of people
[00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.320]   were giving out 23andMe kits back in the day.
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.520]   But some of the interesting things to consider as gifts
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.800]   are getting someone a DEXA scan.
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.540]   I did mine at DEXA Fit, and they have locations all around the country.
[00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.340]   And that was a really cool experience.
[00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.680]   So that would be a cool one.
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.340]   Not that expensive.
[00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.000]   Just a blood panel, right?
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.580]   InstaLab has a longevity panel that's about $300.
[00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:46.980]   There's Function Health.
[00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.440]   There's Inside Tracker.
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.460]   I'll include links to all of these, but that's something super interesting.
[00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.120]   I know that depending on your insurance, some of these tests might be covered,
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.960]   but some of them might not be.
