[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280]   [Silence]
[00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.180]   If right now someone pulled a fire alarm in this building,
[00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.480]   or if we had a fire in this building,
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.480]   my attention would drift.
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.560]   It would not be on recording this podcast.
[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.140]   It would be on something else.
[00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.460]   But would I say that the fire alarm mediates attention?
[00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.860]   I mean, fire alarms are not really involved in attention.
[00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.000]   No, rather they modulate my attention.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.260]   The noise in the room modulates my attention.
[00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.680]   That's quite a bit different
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.000]   than a tool that I'll provide later.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.560]   And I'll just give you a little hint of now.
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.940]   In fact, I'll give it to you now.
[00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.040]   Which is that 40 Hertz binaural beats
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.380]   have been shown in a number of peer-reviewed studies
[00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.760]   to increase focus and concentration.
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.680]   And if you'd like to access 40 Hertz binaural beats
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.080]   in order to improve your focus and concentration,
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.920]   you can do that.
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.520]   You can actually get it at zero cost.
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.560]   You can go into the App Store,
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.360]   for instance, the Apple App Store.
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.000]   This is also available for Android phone.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.280]   There's an app called Brainwave, and you can go there.
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.920]   You can dial in 40 Hertz,
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.840]   and it'll play these binaural beats.
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.240]   It's been shown in multiple quality peer-reviewed studies
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.640]   that playing a pattern of sound waves to one ear,
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.380]   do-do-do-do-do, and the other ear,
[00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.000]   which is slightly offset in frequency,
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.320]   meaning not quite the same frequency,
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.920]   so more like do-do-do-do,
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.600]   that that combination of frequencies
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.680]   played to the different ears
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.640]   actually get integrated within deep brain centers
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.760]   and can increase focus and concentration
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.840]   in part by increasing levels of the neurochemical dopamine
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.720]   and acetylcholine, which we talked about a little bit
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.240]   earlier in this arrow model of focus.
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.200]   So we'll provide a link to that app.
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.080]   I don't have any relationship to that app,
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.120]   I should mention, but it's an excellent one.
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.520]   It's one that I've used for many years.
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.920]   There are also additional functions within the app,
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.060]   such as for sleep and for other things,
[00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.800]   but the 40 Hertz, 40HZ, is the way it reads out.
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.760]   40 Hertz stimulation has been shown
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.880]   to improve focus and concentration.
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.960]   Here is my recommendation in the way that I use it.
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.720]   I would not use 40 Hertz binaural beats
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.000]   every time I'm doing a bout of work.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.280]   What I tend to do is use it
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.440]   for about five minutes prior to that work,
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.520]   and then turn it off and then do the work.
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.160]   And I'll talk about other tools to use during that work,
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.360]   whether or not it's reading or math,
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.720]   or even just emailing or something
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.760]   where I require a bunch of focus for a while.
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.720]   However, there are times in which I'm in an area
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.760]   or I'm in a state of mind
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.000]   where I'm feeling very distractible,
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.800]   and then I'll keep the 40 Hertz binaural beats
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.640]   on the entire time I'm doing that bout of cognitive work.
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.760]   I'll also sometimes use the 40 Hertz binaural beats
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.760]   prior to a workout, in particular weight workouts,
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.240]   where I really want to be able to focus on
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.800]   and contract specific muscles.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.360]   So it's a very useful tool.
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.960]   Again, supported by quality peer-reviewed science,
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.960]   zero cost available out there,
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.880]   not just in the Brainwave app, but in multiple apps.
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.320]   I think many of you will benefit from it.
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.660]   Some of you might not experience it immediately
[00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.760]   as a total dropping into a tunnel of focus
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.680]   in the same way that you might with, say,
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.540]   the sorts of neurochemicals that we'll talk about later,
[00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.640]   like alpha-GPC and some of these other things
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.920]   that change neurochemicals directly.
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.320]   But nonetheless, 40 Hertz binaural beats
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.640]   are a very powerful tool.
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.920]   Again, zero cost, non-pharmacologic tool
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.160]   that tap into your own endogenous, meaning within you,
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.400]   or exists within you physiology,
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.000]   in order to increase acetylcholine
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.320]   and some other neurochemicals.
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.920]   And they have been shown to work quite well.
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.960]   Okay, so assuming that you are sleeping well
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.360]   80% of the nights of your life,
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.080]   or at least working on the various protocols and tools
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.880]   to sleep well and sufficiently long,
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.840]   80% of the nights of your life,
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.760]   and you are interested in additional tools
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.380]   that are sound-based
[00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.800]   in order to improve your ability to concentrate and focus,
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.200]   there are quality peer-reviewed studies
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.640]   supporting the idea that white noise or pink noise,
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.440]   and believe it or not, there is something called pink noise.
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.520]   It has to do with the specific frequencies of sound
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.900]   that are in the noise.
[00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.680]   Well, white noise and pink noise
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.700]   have been shown to not improve concentration per se,
[00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.320]   but to improve people's ability
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.240]   to transition into concentrated states.
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.400]   So I don't tend to use white noise and pink noise
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.720]   while I work, but I know a number of people that do.
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.760]   I know people that also use what's called brown noise.
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.840]   Folks I know from the engineering and computer science side
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.720]   get really into these details of white noise,
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.000]   pink noise, brown noise.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.480]   You can find white noise, pink noise, or brown noise
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.600]   and listen to it through headphones or in the room.
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.820]   There is indeed some data to support the fact
[00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.580]   that white noise, and to some extent,
[00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:18.920]   pink noise and brown noise,
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.960]   can support the release of particular neurochemicals,
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:24.640]   but more data showing that they can amplify the activity
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.280]   of neurons in the so-called prefrontal cortex,
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.240]   this front area, sort of the bumper behind your forehead,
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.360]   that is directly related to your ability
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.000]   to direct your own focus
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.280]   and remain focused on certain things.
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.880]   So you have the option of either using binaural beats before
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.680]   but not during your work, that is 40 hertz binaural beats,
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.400]   or 40 hertz binaural beats
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.320]   throughout your attempt to focus.
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.220]   You also have the option of not using binaural beats,
[00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.760]   but using white noise, pink noise, or brown noise.
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.840]   Again, there are a lot of zero cost apps.
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.960]   You can find also white noise, pink noise,
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.680]   and brown noise on YouTube.
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.400]   Again, these are tools that really have been shown
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.800]   over and over in humans to allow people to focus
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.780]   with more depth and to decrease
[00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.880]   the transition time into focus.
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:11.960]   This is a really key point.
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.400]   A lot of people are challenged
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.000]   with getting into a mode of focus.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.220]   None of us, however, should be expected to just sit down
[00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.080]   and drop directly into a state of focus.
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.920]   I think that's completely an unfair request of ourselves.
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.440]   I mean, for instance, you wouldn't expect yourself
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.580]   to go out on the track or go out for a run and not warm up.
[00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.320]   You might jog for a few minutes or even walk
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.720]   before you would jog and then jog before you would run,
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.360]   right, I would hope you would do that.
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.080]   And if you're doing resistance training,
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.120]   I doubt that you go over and load up the bar or the machine
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.720]   with the maximum amount of weight that you can move
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:41.600]   and then just drop right into that.
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:42.480]   You always do a warmup.
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.400]   And I think it's very important to understand
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.120]   mental work, focus, and concentration
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.960]   as requiring that warmup.
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.480]   What is that warmup?
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.680]   Well, you know what that warmup is.
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.440]   That warmup is the ramping up or the increase
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:00.440]   of epinephrine, adrenaline, acetylcholine, and dopamine.
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.640]   The way that neurochemicals work is we don't just get
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.680]   to flip switches in our brain because we decide to.
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:06.520]   That's a fantasy.
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.760]   That's sort of the limitless movie or, you know,
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.200]   movies and ideas that suddenly, you know,
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.340]   you're going to flip a switch on your arm
[00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.200]   and all of a sudden you're going to be in a laser focus.
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.760]   That is just not the way that your nervous system works.
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.160]   There's a gradual dropping into any state,
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.560]   whether or not that state is sleep, right?
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.080]   You go from shallow sleep to deep sleep
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.880]   and then out eventually.
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:27.200]   Focus too, you go from shallow focus
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.080]   to increasingly deep focus.
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:34.040]   That is in our metaphor of the arrow, it's very broad.
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.120]   It's pointed at a lot of things.
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.840]   And over time, as we drop into focus,
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.560]   that arrow is narrowing and narrowing and narrowing.
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.140]   In fact, probably better to think about it narrowing
[00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:45.280]   and then sometimes oscillating and getting wider again.
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.040]   You know, we might hear something down the hallway
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.600]   or more typically our phone will buzz or we'll think,
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.840]   oh, I wonder what so-and-so is doing
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.940]   or I hadn't contacted them about something.
[00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.260]   Your focus is dynamic.
[00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.040]   It is not what we call a step function.
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.960]   It's not like you go from unfocused to focus
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.240]   and then you drop into your maximal focus.
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.380]   By understanding that it's dynamic,
[00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.000]   by understanding that you are going to be
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.280]   continually going in and out of progressively
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.220]   but varying levels of focus,
[00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:14.240]   you will greatly release the pressure on yourself
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.500]   to feel focused all the time when you want to be.
[00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:18.340]   This is very key.
[00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:20.860]   People who are very good at focusing understand this
[00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:24.620]   and understand that they can't expect themselves
[00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:25.900]   to just immediately focus
[00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.380]   and then snap into or out of focus.
[00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:29.980]   Okay, so be patient with yourself
[00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:33.140]   and also understand that focus is an ability
[00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:35.260]   that you can improve your ability to focus
[00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.020]   by engaging the neural circuits responsible for focus,
[00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:40.960]   repeatedly over time through so-called neuroplasticity,
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.120]   the ability of your nervous system to change
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.160]   in response to experience.
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.000]   And that has a couple of different components,
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.320]   but put very simply,
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:50.040]   what we repeat gets etched into our nervous system
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.840]   and becomes easier over time.
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:55.320]   And the more emotionally important
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.000]   or vital something feels to us,
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.900]   the more likely it is to trigger neuroplasticity.
[00:07:58.900 --> 00:07:59.840]   We're going to talk a little bit more
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.940]   about how to increase neural circuits for focus later,
[00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:03.640]   but right now what you have in hand
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.260]   is the key importance of sleep.
[00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.020]   And I, again, will direct you to hubermanlab.com
[00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:09.160]   and the Neural Network Newsletter
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.760]   to really work on optimizing your sleep.
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:16.420]   We've also got two auditory sound-based tools
[00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:17.260]   for improving focus.
[00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.500]   There's 40 Hertz binaural beats used before
[00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.920]   or during bouts of focusing concentration.
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.640]   And if you don't like those, or even if you do,
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.740]   you might alternate them with or occasionally use
[00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:28.400]   white noise, pink noise, or brown noise,
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.940]   also readily available at zero cost.
[00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:33.520]   [upbeat music]
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:36.940]   [upbeat music]
[00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:39.520]   (upbeat music)
