[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   And I do this little thing called a friends exercise
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.560]   that absolutely leverages the love of your friends.
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.640]   Find a friend who loves you and you love your friend.
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:07.840]   Do not do this with a sibling.
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:08.920]   Do not do this with a parent.
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.300]   Do not do this with one of your kids.
[00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.960]   Those relationships are too close.
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.200]   Best friend, you want a best friend.
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.220]   And you ask them the simple question, why are we friends?
[00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.640]   And they're gonna look at you like you're insane
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.160]   because the part of the brain that controls our feelings,
[00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.840]   like love, doesn't control language.
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.400]   It's very hard to put our feelings into words,
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.200]   which is why we speak in metaphors and analogies
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.240]   when we're talking about our feelings.
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.600]   And so they're gonna hem and haw and be like,
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.680]   I don't know.
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.840]   Well, of course they know, they just can't put it into words.
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.400]   And then interestingly, you stop asking the question, why?
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.400]   And you ask the question, what?
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.680]   Come on, what specifically is it about me
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.940]   that I know you would be there for me no matter what?
[00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.640]   And they will start to try and describe you.
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.440]   I don't know, you're loyal, you're honest.
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.480]   You get that from a lot of people.
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.800]   That's just the definition of a friend.
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.400]   What specifically is about me
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.860]   that I know you'd be there for me no matter what?
[00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.780]   And they're gonna go through a few rounds of this
[00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.080]   and eventually they will give up
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.720]   and they will start describing themselves.
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.040]   And this is what my friend said to me.
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.320]   Look, Simon, I don't know.
[00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.200]   All I know is, is I can sit in a room with you.
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.160]   I didn't even have to talk to you and I feel inspired.
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.680]   and I got goosebumps.
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.920]   In other words, that's when they tapped my why.
