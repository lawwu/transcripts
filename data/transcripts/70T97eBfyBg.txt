[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480]   what most people don't take the time to do is to just orient their second brain into things that
[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.960]   they know they're going to need or care about later. In order for me to do that effectively,
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.720]   I have to know that that is the kind of information of a specific format that I'm looking for,
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.760]   and so I have a note for that, and I have my brain kind of passively as I'm looking through things,
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.040]   not just like willy-nilly being like, "this is interesting, let me throw it in here,
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.240]   this is interesting, let me bookmark it." It's specifically looking for that kind of information
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.960]   of that format. So what that means is then when I'm operating around the web, I'm filtering myself,
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.640]   which means that my "second brain," which again, Evernote notion, you can use whatever tool you
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.760]   want, is organized in a way that I don't have to go back and clean it up and kind of wonder like,
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.760]   "what am I going to do with all this information?" I have almost like a project, a mandate of what
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.840]   what I'm looking for and how it's going to be used later.
